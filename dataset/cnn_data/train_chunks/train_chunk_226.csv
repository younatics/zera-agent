"(AOL Autos)  -- Ever get the feeling the cops are driving a much cooler car than you? Peter Falk's Liutenant Columbo drove a Peugeot 403 to match his famously disheveled detective persona. For decades drivers have seen police officers cruise past in supremely cool cars from supercharged Mustangs to upgraded AMC Javelins and beyond, while modern police units often consist of high-powered Dodge Hemis and, in one incredible instance, a Lamborghini. Cops or detectives portrayed on TV and in the movies are no different, often driving fatter rides than the drug-dealers they pursue. But which are the coolest cop rides of all time, real or fictional? Let's take a look. Dodge Charger Hemi . One of the original muscle cars favored by Blue Mountain moonshine and marijuana smugglers to outrun the boys in blue in the 1970s got a swift turnaround a couple years ago with Dodge's earth-shattering introduction of the new Charger, its Hemi engine and its use by police forces across the nation. Officers generally compare it favorably with standard Crown Victoria vehicles and laud its performance and versatility (which I can vouch for having tested the stock R/T last year); upgrades for police use one include steering, brakes and idle-time chip. Almost all are 5.7-liter Hemi variants, which put out a whopping 368hp and top out at 170 mph. AOL Autos: Dodge Charger . 'Knight Rider's' Ford Mustang GT500KR . Forget David Hasselhof's Speak-n-Spell-voiced Trans-Am, we're talking serious muscle with Ford's monstrous Ford Mustang GT500KR that featured in last year's ill-fated reworking of ""Knight Rider,"" a model I also ragged around Los Angeles port about this time last year (and was very careful not to attract the attention of harbor authorities). The most powerful stock car Ford has built, the Shelby variant seethes and stomps its way to a mile a minute in about the same time as a Corvette but shades it for fun thanks to its astonishing 480lb-ft of torque at 4500rpm and solid-axle rear suspension that allows the back end to fly out on fantastic cop-car action sequences. Trivia: K.I.T.T., the 1980s original smartcar, stands for Knight Industries Two-Thousand. AOL Autos: Ford Shelby GT500 . Italian Police Lamborghini Gallardo . Want to make the 424 miles from Turin to Rome in under three hours? Italian police long ago caught on to the race-driver fanaticism of its citizenry thanks in large part to Ferrari -- and perhaps less so to Fiat -- and its polizia made sure they could keep up earlier this year by springing for a Lambo, perhaps the most incredible police vehicle on the planet. Alongside undeniable performance, this specially equipped supercar offers real-time wireless image-and-voice transmitting equipment and a natty cooler for storing crime scene evidence. Initial reports suggest the Gallardo's reliability stands up to punishing police driving habits on Italian autostradas surprisingly well. AOL Autos: Lamborghini Gallardo . Steve McQueen 'Bullitt' Ford Mustang GT . Long before the Cooler King was the main man to seek out at tailgate parties, Steve McQueen took the nickname and turned on a whole generation to the muscle of the Mustang in his 1968 GT 390 Fastback that bounced and careened around the streets of San Francisco, California, in perhaps the era's coolest film, and one which regularly tops the charts of best car chase captured on celluloid. The film pioneered cutaway shots of McQueen, an avid rally driver, as he put the big-block pony through its paces in the 10-minute scene but, unusually for the King of Cool, the main star here was his car. Ford released a limited-edition Bullitt commemorative model in 2008. AOL Autos: Ford Mustang . Green Hornet 1966 Chrysler Crown Imperial . With some suggesting a movie remake of the 1960s cult series is in the works, attention now focuses on what will take the place of the ""Green Hornet's"" 1966 Chrysler Crown Imperial, famously driven by Bruce Lee (in his role of Kato). While the angular and rectangular Black Beauty pioneered gizmos like infrared lights, rocket launchers and flipper license plate more associated with Bond's Aston Martin, it was always Lee and not Van Williams, the Hornet, who got the pleasure of tilting the car onto two wheels to get through narrow alleyways and other criminal hang-outs. Keep your eyes out for the latest movie developments, which may or may not -- but should -- include the famous line: ""Let's roll, Kato!"" 1970s Pony Cars . Judging by the huge rims and lowered suspensions on the Chevy Tahoes currently patrolling Santa Monica beachfront, police departments often like to drop a hint of style and attitude in their rides, too. In the 1970s, decade of Aviator sunglasses and massive sideburns, it was no different. Officers to this day talk about the series of high-performance police vehicles that includes Chevrolet Camaros, Ford Mustangs and the legendary AMC Javelin, all stock V8 power with upgraded brakes and steering that packed more muscles than Bubba in Cell Block D. Most of these specially built units topped out near 150 mph and were especially prized for their straight-line capabilities while an officer in pursuit bumped and nudged his target vehicle in a bid to force them off the road. AOL Autos: Chevy Camaro . ""Miami Vice"" Ferrari Testarossa . The ultimate in machismo cool in its day, though now considered slightly cheeseball, Crockett and Tubbs defined 1980s New Wave slick with their boss combo of boats, 'Bans and Miami Beach swagger. Though the Daytona Spyder 365 driven by the dynamic detectives in the first two series was a kit car replica of various Ferrari panels and equipment bolted onto a Corvette chassis, the twin Testarossas that feature in the later series were donated by Enzo Ferrari, a fan of the show (with an obvious gift for marketing). The Testarossa would go on to define the Ferrari brand in United States in the 1980s, while a strange breed of setose men in linen suits with no socks can still be spotted in corners of Ford Lauderdale to this day. In director Michael Mann's 2006 movie, the Testarossa morphs into a suitably stylish F430. Magnum PI 308GTS . As if Don Johnson wasn't enough 1980s for one list, we add Tom Selleck to the mix in his role as ""Magnum P.I."" without forgetting how much Selleck's silky mustache and coiff did for sales of his trademark targa Ferrari 308GTS in the States. Mid-engined and with the smaller wheelbase common to Ferrari's of the period, 308s sold in record numbers for Ferraris and can still be seen on roads today, indicating that Scaglietti build quality can withstand some serious highway pounding that belies its lightweight fiberglass frame. Selleck steered his on the mean streets of Hawaii, tracking criminals in his role as a private investigator. Not a police vehicle, you say? Selleck's mustache qualifies him as an honorary police officer in my book any day. Columbo's Peugeot 403 . ""And one more thing..."" wraps up our list with Peter Falk's Liutenant Columbo reveling in a dilapidated Peugeot banger to match his famously disheveled detective persona. France's finest prancing lion, a 1.5 liter four-cylinder that put out a mere 68hp, was a perfect fit with Falk's seemingly slow-witted persona that ultimately always got his man in the end. Similarly, the 403, which Columbo delighted in driving the drop-top variant, was a vital cog in Peugeot's dominance of its domestic and European market with a series of idiosyncratic cars beloved by their followers but which remained a Columbo-esque mystery to their detractors. I had the pleasure of driving an excellent Peugeot 307 cabriolet next to a vintage 403 at a motor show in Europe a couple years back, and felt a slight pang that I wasn't wearing a shabby raincoat to match. Blues Brothers Interceptor Mashup . Everyone knows the Blues Mobile -- Jake and Elwood's 1974 Dodge Monaco in ""The Blues Brothers"" movie -- but few know where all the cop cars famously smashed to pieces in the film came from. Paul Anderson, a journalist in Los Angeles, says it was his dad, also Paul, a Chicago, Illinois, police radio engineer who was tasked with fixing up the Dodge Polaras and Monacos wrecked in the film (with the Chicago city council spurred into action by the possibility of Steven Spielberg and John Landis coming to their city to make a big-budget movie). He once recounted to Paul: ""I just remember one day my boss, the lieutenant who always gave me a hard time, came to me and pointed to the auto graveyard where all the out-of-service squad cars were and said, 'See all those cars? Your job is to get them started.' I said, 'Are you kidding?'"" Paul adds: ""[My Dad] had a savant-like ability to rescue beaters from near-death experiences. When the movie came out, he went to see it like everyone else and he could remember each and every one of those cars.""","Officers laud the Dodge Charger Hemi's performance and versatility .

"(CNN) -- One look at her photo, and you can't help but ask: How could someone so young and vibrant die so quickly from an infection? Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died from a sepsis infection. Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa was a healthy 20-year-old when doctors told her she had a urinary tract infection, her family says. The infection spread, and after amputating her feet, doctors thought they had the situation under control, according to a blog run by a family friend. ""She's alive, [she] will survive,"" Renato Lindgren wrote on the blog on January 20, before da Costa also had to have her hands amputated, and part of her stomach and both kidneys extracted. ""She can eat well, visit the sea, swim, travel, talk with her friends and family, marry and have a baby. She has a full and beautiful life ahead."" Four days later, da Costa was dead. Sepsis -- the body's inflammatory response to an infection -- really can kill that quickly, according to Dr. Kevin Tracey, author of a book about sepsis called ""Fatal Sequence: The Killer Within."" ""This isn't a one in a million case,"" says Tracey, chief executive officer of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York. ""When an infection reaches a certain point, this can happen in a matter of hours."" Sepsis usually starts out as an infection in just one part of the body, such as a skin wound or a urinary tract infection, Tracey says. For example, Muppets creator Jim Henson died in 1990 from a case of sepsis that started out as pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs. He was 53. Most of the time, simple, localized infections remain just that: easy to treat and in one part of the body. Why some infections rage out of control and shut down vital organs is a mystery, but experts say it rarely happens in young, healthy people, like da Costa.  Watch more on avoiding septicemia » . ""You can ask, 'Why her?' but really no one knows why her,"" Tracey says. ""It might have something to do with her immune system. It might be about her genetics."" The Mayo Clinic sees about 100 cases a year of young, healthy people who develop sepsis, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at Mayo. With treatment, which usually involves antibiotics and sometimes draining of the wound, about 75 percent survive. Sampathkumar says the key is to keep an eye on even such simple infections as a small skin wound. A fever, a dramatic shift in blood pressure, rapid breathing and extreme confusion are all signs that someone needs quick medical help, she says. ""You need to watch it,"" she says. Dr. Carl Flatley said he had no idea what to watch for when his 23-year-old daughter, Erin, developed sepsis in 2002. He says she went into the hospital for a minor hemorrhoid procedure and five days later was dead from sepsis. ""It's a horrible death,"" he says. Two years later, knowing the signs of sepsis saved his own life, says Flatley, a dentist in Dunedin, Florida. He fell ill, and an emergency room doctor said he had a urinary tract infection and sent him home. But Flatley said he suspected it was much more than a UTI. ""I felt very sick. My testicle was sore. I told him I was concerned I had sepsis and I refused to go home. He got very irritated with me,"" Flatley says. But in the end, Flatley was admitted to the hospital, where the infection had become so severe that doctors were forced to remove his right testicle. Flatley started The Sepsis Alliance to educate others about sepsis, where he tries to walk a fine line. ""You don't want to panic people. We all get infections and, thank God, most of them heal,"" he says. ""So this is what I tell people: If you're feeling bad all over and have a high temperature and either high or low blood pressure, those are all indications that your whole system has been infected. It could be sepsis."" He advises getting medical help immediately, and to specifically mention that you're concerned you might have sepsis. ""You don't want to take any chances,"" he says. CNN's Jennifer Pifer-Bixler and Sabriya Rice and CNN Español's Cibele Lorenzoni contributed to this report.","Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa, 20,  died after sepsis infection spread .

"(CNN) -- State authorities dispatched emergency crews Tuesday to survey the damage after an onslaught of severe weather in Mississippi that injured at least 17 people, damaged property and cut power. The National Weather Service said ""probable tornados"" caused significant damage across central Mississippi, including in Yazoo, Attala, Warren, Oktibbeha, and Smith counties. In Attala County, storms damaged several mobile homes, injuring six people and leaving parts of the area without power, the service said. Eleven more people were injured in Monroe County, where storms damaged homes and a radio communications tower, it said. A tornado touched down in Yazoo County on Monday night, causing damage to a downtown Yazoo City courthouse and tossing debris in a wide area, according to emergency management spokesman. The twister touched down around 8:05 p.m. local time (9:05 p.m. ET), according to the National Weather Service's Jackson, Mississippi, office. Approximately 30 percent of the area is still without power, the Weather Service reported. Greg Flynn, spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said the damage included ""a lot of windows blown out, some roof damage and very little power in the downtown area"" of Yazoo City. No severe injuries or deaths have been reported, he said. ""We've been getting inundated with round after round after round"" of heavy rain, Flynn said Tuesday morning. In April, at least 10 people died when a mile-wide tornado tore through Mississippi. Two of the dead were children, and one was a 3-month-old baby, according to the state emergency management agency. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of the state, four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson, and one was from Holmes County, also in north central Mississippi. CNN Radio's Greg Black and CNN's Sean Morris and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: 17 people are injured in storms .

"(CNN) -- It's a good bet that Lolo Jones and Lauryn Williams won't be wearing singlets for this Olympics. But it's also safe to assume that -- once again -- they'd be plenty fast. These two U.S. Track and Field stars got one step closer Saturday to another Olympic Games, this time in wintry Russia. They are among the women named Saturday as ""push athletes"" for the Americans' six-women bobsled team, according to the USA Bobsled and Skeleton Federation. Williams acknowledged the honor with a quick, emphatic message on her Twitter feed to those offering congratulations: ""Thank you!"" Jones quickly followed suit, while noting that Saturday's announcement means she's part of the national team, but not necessarily off to Sochi this coming winter. The Olympic team will be named in January, though those on the national team certainly have a big leg up on the competition. The others in the same group as Jones and Williams include 2010 Olympian Emily Azevdo, two-time World Champion medalist Katie Eberling, two-time national push champ Aja Evans and Kristi Koplin. Those piloting the American bobsleds are Elana Meyers -- who won a silver medal as last season's World Championship -- as well as Jamie Gruebel and Jazmine Fenlator. These are all accomplished athletes in their own right, though Jones and Williams are probably the most recognizable among the U.S. public. Williams, 30, emerged in 2002 as a U.S. Junior then World Junior champ in the 100-meter dash, the same footrace in which she won the 2004 NCAA crown while attending the University of Miami. That same year, Williams made her Olympic debut -- finishing second in the 100. The Miami resident finished first in the 2005 World Outdoor 100 meters, and was a two-time gold medalist (in 2005 and 2007) in the World Outdoor 4x100 relay. She also made the U.S. Olympic team in 2008 after placing third in the trials. The photogenic Jones may be as recognizable for her commercials and photo shoots in some circles, though she's been a fierce and accomplished track and field athlete in her own right. The Iowa native is an 11-time All-American from her days at Louisiana State University, where she won titles in both sprint relays and the hurdles. In 2008, Jones appeared on top of the track world -- winning the 60-meter hurdles in the World Indoor Championships and being named the VISA Humanitarian Athlete of the Year for good deeds outside the sport. In fact, she entered that summer's Olympics in Beijing as a gold medal favorite, only to trip on a hurdle and finish seventh. She suffered another setback in 2011 when she underwent spinal surgery, yet still managed to make the next year's Olympic team. This time, Jones did better but finished just out of the medals, in fourth.","Lolo Jones, Lauryn Williams are both accomplished track and field athletes .

"(CNN) -- Having to guard NBA stars like LeBron James and Paul Pierce can be the most daunting task for many basketball players. But for Milwaukee Bucks forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute -- who is actually a prince in his native Cameroon -- turning up against such basketball royalty is an enthralling experience. ""I take pride in my defense,"" says Mbah a Moute, a 6 feet 8 inches forward who has leaped onto the NBA scene in the last few years, becoming an athletic ambassador for Africa in the world's top basketball league. Born and raised in Cameroon, Mbah a Moute is the third-youngest son of the chieftain of a village near the country's capital Yaounde. His father is also the general manager of the Cameroonian National Employment Fund. Describing his upbringing, Mbah a Moute is quick to point out that it was far from luxurious, calling it ""regular middle class."" ""When people hear you are a prince they think of Eddie Murphy and [1988 movie] ""Coming to America,"" which is totally not true,"" he explains. ""My dad is just the chief of my village, it's not like Zamunda or the crazy things you see in the movie -- I don't have my face on the money but you get treated with respect and have ceremonies."" The agile forward is one of seven African basketball players currently in the NBA, hoping to walk in the footsteps of other basketball legends from the continent such as Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo. See more: NBA legend Dikembe Mutombo on his love for Africa . He is the lynchpin of the Bucks' defensive play and widely regarded as one of the league's best players to counter opposition threats -- Mbah a Moute has so far guarded everyone, from towering forwards like Kevin Garnett to shorter scoring machines such as Dwyane Wade. ""I think there is no one like him in the game because he can guard one through five positions on the floor -- big guys, small guys,"" says Australian player Andrew Bogut. ""I call him the fire blanket because when guys get on fire in the game, we put Luc on them and he usually shuts them down,"" adds Bogut, who recently left Bucks to play for the Golden State Warriors. Raised in Yaounde, a metropolitan city with more than a million residents, Mbah a Moute first picked up a basketball when he was 12 years old. By the time he turned 15, he was one of the best youth players in his country, and three years later he was playing college basketball with UCLA in the United States. ""It's a pretty interesting journey,"" he says. ""When I first came here I just knew how to say 'hi,' 'how are you' and 'good night' -- pretty much that was about it."" But it didn't take long for him to overcome the initial challenges of his new environment. His energetic game quickly became popular with the fans and Mbah a Moute developed a faithful following around the UCLA campus. ""There was another guy on the team from Cameroon and the fans were so good to us and they created the 'Cameroon crazies,'"" he recalls. ""They had flags and T-shirts and one time they came out with a shirt -- 'Moute kicks Boute' -- and then next year everyone starts wearing that and I was like 'wow.'"" His athletic talents also caught the eye of NBA's top teams and in 2008, Mbah a Moute fulfilled his childhood dream and became a professional player at the age of 21. Read more: Wheelchair champ Ade Adepitan . Although he wasn't initially seen as one of the most exciting prospects to come out of college basketball that year -- he was a second-round draft pick for the Bucks -- Mbah a Moute was determined to not let this chance slip through his fingers. ""Most second-round picks don't stick -- a lot of times don't even play -- but I think I was determined,"" he says. ""I just needed the opportunity and the chance and the Bucks gave me the opportunity and once I got that I seized it and the rest is history,"" Mbah a Moute says smiling. And he has plenty of reasons to smile. He did not only stick to the world's toughest league but he recently re-signed with the Bucks for another four years -- the new deal more than tripled his salary, netting him close to $19 million. But despite all his success in the basketball courts of America, the 25-year-old NBA star has not forgotten his roots. He wants to give back to his country and continent, helping young Africans to realize their potential. Read more: Legendary athlete Kip Keino goes extra mile for Kenyan youth . ""The most rewarding part is being able to impact people,"" he says. ""I represent Cameroon, Africa, keeping the dream for other kids."" In the summer of 2009, Mbah a Moute traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa, to take part in Basketball Without Borders, the NBA's ongoing effort to give talented youth a chance to play the game. ""There is a lot of potential in Africa, athletically, intellectually,"" he says. ""You've got a lot of different people and they need to understand that they have a lot of potential and can do great things and moving forward to becoming the Africa of tomorrow.""

"Zhuhai, China (CNN) -- Armed with glossy sales catalogs and a shy swagger, Samuel Wong hopes to transform his family-run firm from a manufacturer of hum-drum fishing vessels and houseboats into a maker of sophisticated super yachts. His company makes up to six 86-foot and 98-foot yachts a year at its shipyard in Zhuhai, southern China, under its Accelera brand. The name was coined by Wong because it ""sounded Italian."" The company aims to compete in a marketplace currently dominated by European yacht makers like Azimut and Sunseeker and count billionaires among its clients. ""Li Ka-shing would never buy our brand but I hope in 10 years time he might consider it,"" said Wong, 36, referring to Asia's richest man, who is rumored to keep an 84-foot Italian-made Riva yacht at an exclusive Hong Kong marina. Wong's attempt to move upmarket is a reflection of China's changing industrial base and the challenges many Chinese companies face as they try to move away from mass-produced goods to higher-value, branded products. The company sold seven vessels to buyers in Hong Kong and China in the last financial year. It remains to be seen whether the brand-conscious ranks of China's newly affluent will embrace a home-grown yacht-builder with little pedigree - though a cheaper price tag may appeal as the country's economic growth begins to slow. What's more, Accelera and China's other budding yacht makers such as IAG Yachts and Kingship, face stiff competition from European and U.S. rivals, who see China as a much-needed money spinner while their traditional markets struggle. Located in a sleepy corner of the Pearl River Delta, the shipyard where Accelera's yachts are produced is a world away from the luxury marinas where these rich man toys end up. The drive from the nearest city passes through villages dotted with ponds filled with lotus flowers. Fishing nets and the odd fish hang to dry by the roadside. The shipyard employs around 100 people and is run by Wong's father and brother. Workers are busy spray-painting a house-boat and crafting the interior of a three-storey, 86-foot yacht that will be delivered to a Hong Kong businessman by the end of the year. Wong, who is based in Hong Kong, says that China's cheaper labor costs are the main reason Accelera's vessels cost a third of those produced by the likes of Sunseeker and Azimut . Skilled workers at the shipyard earn, on average, 6,000 yuan ($957) a month but Wong says it can be difficult to find staff with the right experience. The 98-foot yacht costs around $5 million and takes up to 15 months to build, while the 86-foot model costs around $1.2 million. The workers, some wearing only plastic sandals, deftly make their way along narrow, five-meter high concrete platforms that divide the slipways and cranes that keep the vessels steady while they're being built. At the center of the shed, which is littered with building materials, is a red shrine where apples, tea and incense have been made as offerings to a folk god for construction workers. When I first came across Accelera's yachts at a boat show in Hong Kong in May 2011, the vessels did not look out of place in the marina full of Italian and British-made yachts, but the interior smelt synthetic and compared poorly to the richly hued timber and buttery leather used by the European brands. Wong says he has since employed Italian consultants to improve the yacht's design both inside and out. ""We are focused on matching our customer's preference,"" he said. He says that many of his clients use the boats for business and entertaining -- a karaoke den is a common request. Ryan Swift, editor of Asia-Pacific Boating magazine, says that Chinese yacht builders are a ""mixed bag"" but some, such as Kingship's steel and aluminum hulled vessels, are beginning to gain recognition. ""Their products are at the lower end of the scale,"" he said. ""At half the price or less of international names, you have to sacrifice in terms of quality."" Gordon Hui, the Asia managing director of UK yacht builder Sunseeker, said Chinese yacht builders are credible competitors, especially for smaller, family boats. However, he said they are yet to mount a serious challenge in the corporate market where premium brands are most coveted. Read: Inside the mind of a yacht cartoonist . Other Chinese companies are taking a different approach to grass-roots brands like Accelera, opting instead to scoop up foreign yacht brands as a shortcut to global success. Earlier this year, Shandong Heavy Industry Group, best known for its bulldozers, took a 75% stake in luxury Italian yacht maker Ferretti, which also makes Riva and Pershing yachts. It plans to open an assembly plant in Qingdao, a major port in northern China and the site of the 2008 Olympic sailing regatta, to customize yachts for China's market. Swift says that European brands like Azimut and Sunseeker have ""made a killing"" in China as the country's elite discovers the pleasures of messing about on boats. But he warned that yachting's long-term development may be limited by steep taxes, onerous regulation and a lack of marinas. For Wong and his Accelera yachts, the next step is to build a larger shipyard, with state-of-the-art facilities, that would allow for up to 15 yachts to be made a year. Currently, electronics and other finishing touches are installed in Hong Kong, which means the yachts incur customs duties for Chinese buyers. But with China's economy experiencing its slowest growth in more than a decade, Wong is concentrating on promoting his brand: . ""The biggest difficulty, we think, is to convince customers to spend their money on yachts that have been manufactured in China.""","Chinese ship builder hopes to create super yacht brand .

"(CNN) -- He is one of the greatest skiers of all time, the winner of every major prize on offer, but when Alberto Tomba looks back on his legendary career he feels a pang of regret. ""La Bomba"" called it quits at the end of the 1998 season, aged 31, having won three Olympic gold medals, two world championship titles and 50 World Cup races. His final victory in the slalom at the World Cup Finals in Crans Montana of 1998 meant the Italian established a record, as yet unbroken, of being the only male skier to win at least one race per year for 11 straight seasons. Tomba's farewell appearance in the Winter Olympics in Nagano in 1998 ended in a rare failure but, after watching the next two as a frustrated spectator, he came to the conclusion he had stopped racing prematurely. ""I was watching Salt Lake City 2002, Torino 2006, and after Torino I said, 'Oh, I stopped skiing too early, I was too young, I was 31,' "" he told CNN's Alpine Edge series. ""I may feel in good shape but now I'm 46 and what I can do? It's too late."" It is debatable whether Tomba might have added to his victories, but he can reflect on leaving an indelible mark on his sport -- earning the adulation of fans not just in his home country, but the world over. His flamboyant style on the slopes was matched by a reputation for fast living off piste, but Tomba insists it was exaggerated. ""No, no no -- only half is true! All the time they invented it, just for the press ... for fun. To provoke me also!"" Current World Cup star Didier Cuche also believes Tomba rather cleverly maintained the image, but remained a very serious competitor at heart. ""I hear that he went to sleep really early, got up at 2 o'clock in the night, went out for an hour and then went to bed again ... he was playing a little bit with that,"" the Swiss skier told CNN. The longevity of Tomba's career is testament to his ability and the hard work he put in, scoring his first World Cup victory in 1987 when he beat his great idol, Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden. Two gold medals at the 1988 Calgary Olympics catapulted him to world stardom and he successfully defended his giant slalom crown in the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. 1995 was to prove Tomba's best season on the World Cup circuit, winning 11 races and claiming the famous Crystal Globe as overall champion. A combination of circumstances had prevented Tomba from claiming a world championship title, but he put that right in 1996 with double gold. It remains the highlight of a career full of highlights for Tomba, now the patron of an Italian Winter Sports Federation project which targets youngsters who will be looking to follow in his giant footsteps. ""I think it was in Sierra Nevada, my world championships, I won two gold in two days. It was amazing, also the weather, the climate -- everything was perfect,"" he recalled. Tomba returned home to a rapturous welcome. ""I remember when I flew back to Italy, everybody expects Alberto at Bologna Airport, but I fly back to Parma because it was full, many people, 20,000 people -- that was amazing."" Tomba was famous for his daring charges in the deciding second runs of his races, often making up large deficits from the first leg to storm to victory. For his second gold in the giant slalom in Sierra Nevada he made up 0.81 seconds on the first-leg leader to top the podium. Fellow ski legend Franz Klammer told CNN that was typical of Tomba's style. ""The way he skied, he was so light even though he was a big guy, he was so light on the skis, smooth and he could pull it off -- even though if the first run was not that great, he could really do it on the second run,"" the Austrian said.","Alberto Tomba won three Olympic gold medals during his glittering skiing career .

"Chardon, Ohio (CNN) -- The cafeteria table where the deadly Ohio high school shooting began became a somber memorial for grief-stricken students returning for Friday first full day of classes since the incident. A boy at Chardon High opened fire on Monday and killed three classmates. Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire. The shooting rocked the school and the community of 5,100 people located 30 miles east of Cleveland. Teens heading back to their daily routines noticed some changes designed to reassure and calm them. Senior Garrett Szalay told CNN the lunchroom table where the shooting began hasn't been moved. Flowers and stuffed animals are sitting on top of it, he said. The cafeteria was repainted and tables were rearranged to give the room a different look. The table, with its fake woodgrain top, chrome legs and bench seats, sits perpendicular in the cafeteria, a counterpoint to the way the other tables are arranged. Grief counselors and police were on hand, and the principal led a moment of silence, Szalay said . ""Everyone is here for each other,"" Szalay said. ""But a lot of us are moving on."" The person who authorities say is responsible, 17-year-old T.J. Lane, was charged Thursday afternoon with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault, the latter related to the student who was ""nicked in the ear"" by a bullet, according to Geauga County Prosecuting Attorney David Joyce. Friday marked the first full school day since the incident, a return that administrators and staff touted as key to helping people through the healing process. School superintendent Joseph Bergant said that staff spent two days working on the transition, expressing confidence that they'll be ready to provide comfort and support to those still trying to make sense of this week's carnage. Some students were with their parents in the school on Thursday and counseling has been made available at various locales since the shooting. ""I watched families walk through the school holding hands, I watched people helping each other come back into the school,"" said Geauga County Sheriff Dan McClelland of the scene inside the school Thursday. ""It was an incredible spirit of Chardon. I'll never forget that. This is why we live here."" Frank Hall, an assistant football coach and study hall teacher who chased the gunman from the school, said Thursday it was important that students and staff return -- if for no other reason than to ""show that terror and evil do not win out."" Coach deflects ""hero"" label . ""I'm here to tell you that tomorrow our schools will be open, our teachers will be there, our administration will be there, our parents and community, but more important our children will be there,"" said Hall. Meanwhile, the legal process continues. Joyce, the prosecuting attorney, filed charges against Lane around 3:40 p.m. Thursday in juvenile court. The defendant's next court appearance will be March 6. A hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court. The murder charges state that the teenager ""purposely and with prior calculation and design"" fatally shot three people while at Chardon High. The prosecutor has said that the sophomore confessed that he took a .22-caliber gun and a knife into the school Monday morning and fired 10 rounds as frightened students and some teachers ran for cover. By the time the bloodshed ended, three were killed: Daniel Parmertor, 16, who died Monday; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died Tuesday morning; and Russell King Jr., 17, who was declared brain dead Tuesday. This is not Lane's first brush with the law, according to juvenile records released by authorities this week. When he was 15, Lane was charged with juvenile assault for putting his uncle in a choke hold and punching him in the face, according to an incident report from the Geauga County Sheriff's Office. The report stated that Lane's aunt called 911 in December 2009 to report the boy and his uncle ""were physically fighting"" -- and, at one point, the teen teamed up with his then-16-year-old brother, who himself was later charged with simple assault. Two sheriff's deputies arrived to find the uncle ""bleeding from the mouth and ... on the kitchen floor."" Lane pleaded ""true,"" the equivalent of guilty, to lesser charges of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to up to 30 days in a detention center, fined and ordered to complete 24 hours of community service, according to court documents. At the time, Lane was in his grandparents' custody, according to the complaint. Lane's driver's license was recently suspended for two and a half months after he was ticketed for ""failure to control"" a vehicle. The license was reinstated in early February upon his completion of a mandatory driver improvement program, records show. Lane's friends have said that the teen had a troubled childhood. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged with holding a different woman under running water and bashing her head into a wall. ""I think there's a lot of kids that go through things like that. That doesn't give them the right to kill other people,"" said Bob Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's grandfather. ""There are five families, including ours, that have been affected by this. No one has the right to shoot other people because they've had a rough life."" At an earlier news conference Thursday, relatives of two of the slain children described what the boys were like . ""My brother was the happiest kid on the planet,"" Dominic Parmertor said of Daniel. ""He never got mad at anybody. He just loved to have fun. And when he was happy, other people were happy."" ""He would never do anything bad to anybody,"" Dominic Parmertor added. ""He was going to change the world. He was an amazing individual."" Phyllis Ferguson, mother of Demetrius Hewlin, said her son donated his organs. His death was ""not in vain,"" she said. ""For his one life, he gets to change eight lives."" She described her son as a ""computer nerd"" and ""health nut"" who loved football and worked out regularly. ""Most of all, I'm gonna miss his hugs and kisses,"" she said. Ferguson had a message for parents: ""No matter what you're going through ... you grab your children, you kiss them and tell them you love them."" Ferguson said she didn't do that on Monday, because Demetrius was running late. Both Daniel and Demetrius were shot in the head, their relatives said. The mother of one of the wounded children spoke as well. Holly Walczak's son Nick was wounded in his arm, neck and back, ""which created a spinal shock,"" she said, adding that he is in serious condition but doctors are optimistic for his recovery. If a teacher had not pulled him to a safer place, it is likely Nick would have died as well, she said. Ron Parmertor, Daniel's uncle, called on young people to watch out for potential signs on social media that someone they know may be troubled. If something posted on a social network ""doesn't look right, tell your mom and dad, tell the police, tell a counselor, tell a neighbor, tell a friend. Just tell somebody,"" he said. And, he added, to anyone who is having trouble dealing with the tragedy: ""Please talk to somebody.""

"(CNN) -- He's terrified millions of children with his books, from ""Welcome to the Dead House"" to ""Planet of the Lawn Gnomes."" But R.L. Stine isn't ready to let his audience grow up in peace. With the 20th anniversary of his popular ""Goosebumps"" series comes Stine's adult horror novel ""Red Rain."" The book follows travel writer Lea Sutter into the middle of a devastating hurricane and out again with a pair of evil twins who will wreak their own kind of devastation on her family. Stine isn't the first young-adult author to venture into adult fiction. J.K. Rowling recently released a novel titled ""The Casual Vacancy"" that sold 157,000 hardcover copies in its first week of publication, according to Nielsen BookScan. Beloved ""Sweet Valley"" creator Francine Pascal has also moved into the adult world with her characters; Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield grew up in ""Sweet Valley Confidential"" and started their 30s in this summer's novella e-series ""The Sweet Life."" ""Red Rain"" isn't even the first adult book Stine has written. In 2000, he released a novel called ""Superstitious"" about a professor named Liam O'Connor who is the most superstitious man in the world, for good reason. Stine's publishers expected a best-seller, but book sales were mediocre for an author with such a big reputation. ""It was too early to do an adult novel. No one asked about it. ... I've been waiting by the phone for 12 years,"" Stine joked. This time, his fans are ready. They've been hounding Stine on Twitter -- he has almost 60,000 followers -- asking him to write a book for them. ""That's how I keep in touch,"" Stine said. ""There are no kids on Twitter. It's all people (in their 20s, 30s) who read 'Goosebumps' and 'Fear Street' in the '90s. They were my huge audience."" Stine has written more than 300 books that have sold a combined 350 million copies around the world. (At one point, he was churning out 12 ""Goosebumps"" books a year; now he's down to six.) At the recent National Book Festival in Washington, the author's autograph line seemed endless. ""It was amazing. It was 7-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds. Half of them were like, 'I loved your books when I was a kid,' "" Stine said. ""It's great for my ego."" Stacy Creamer, editor for ""Red Rain"" as well as the vice president and publisher for Touchstone, knows Stine's work well. Her 10-year-old son devours his books ""like crack."" ""To see that kind of enthusiasm in my own son, it was easy to see if, you know, someone checked in with him 10, 15 years from now. ... I think he'd be pretty intrigued."" Stine sent Creamer an outline for ""Red Rain."" The plot he wanted to tackle seemed so complicated, Creamer was a little nervous. But after receiving the finished novel, she said, she would have published the book even from an unknown author. Of course, having Stine's name attached added a bit of glamour. ""I knew he had the chops to do it, because I think writers are writers,"" Creamer said. ""But man, he just slammed it."" There are pitfalls to having a children's author write an adult novel. Although Rowling's ""The Casual Vacancy"" is on track to become one of the best-selling hardcover novels of the year, it has received mixed reviews. ""After all of this magic, what could we have expected?"" professor Seth Lerer wrote for The Daily Beast. "" 'The Casual Vacancy' may be a disappointment, but it is a natural one. For after having written books of magic for a magical age, Rowling has come out with a book of Muggle life for Muggles. Is this what happens when you grow up?"" Pascal's ""Sweet Valley Confidential"" ended up on best-seller lists as well, but fans were outraged at the experiences Pascal crafted for her once-innocent teen characters. ""I felt a 27-year-old woman (Elizabeth) was entitled to an orgasm,"" Pascal said with a laugh. ""You would be surprised at how many responses I got that didn't feel that way. ... I had somehow maligned their hero, and it was not good."" Pascal's idea for an adult novel came in a similar way to Stine's. Facebook was her inspiration; on the social media site, she said, everyone is looking for the kid they grew up with, the friend from elementary school, their high school sweetheart. ""Strangely enough, even though these are fictional characters, they are real (to fans),"" Pascal said. ""I thought they would have a curiosity to find out what happened to these people they lived with."" Curiosity seems to have outweighed outrage for the millions of Sweet Valley readers. ""The Sweet Life"" e-series was downloaded more than 40,000 times. A copy of all six novellas will be available in one hardcover book October 30. Stine won't have to wait long to see whether ""Red Rain"" is a success; the book is released Tuesday. If it is, he just might continue to give his grown-up fans goosebumps. ""I'll wait by the phone, see if it's another 12 years,"" Stine laughed. ""I'd love to do another one."" Do you follow the authors you read as a child or young adult today?

"(CNN) -- An Arizona police department will conduct an investigation into the bloody arrest of a 54-year-old grandfather during a Black Friday sale at a Walmart, an assistant police chief said Saturday. Jerald Newman, 54, was released Saturday from a Maricopa County jail, his wife, Pamela, told CNN. He has been charged with resisting arrest and shoplifting. ""(He is) as good as expected ... but he is emotionally and mentally a wreck,"" she said. Newman was among a throng of shoppers crammed into a Buckeye, Arizona, Walmart soon after it opened late the night of Thanksgiving. ""They were just letting people in; there was nowhere to walk,"" said his daughter, Berneta Sanchez, who was also in the store. ""Teenagers and adults were fighting for these games, taking them away from little kids and away from my father."" The suspect's grandson, Nicholas Nava, told CNN affiliate KNXV that Newman had grabbed one video game and put it under his shirt so that others jostling for the game didn't take it from him. One person alerted a police officer, who then approached Newman. David Chadd, a CNN iReporter from Las Vegas, was among the crowd shopping for video games set up in the Walmart's grocery section. He said Newman ""was not resisting"" arrest as he was led away from the crowd by a police officer. That officer, Chadd said, then suddenly hooked the suspect around the leg, grabbed him and ""slammed him face first into the ground."" ""It was like a bowling ball hitting the ground, that's how bad it was,"" he said. Video, recorded by Chadd and later posted on CNN's iReport, shows an apparently unconscious Newman head-down on the floor in a pool of blood. As he's turned over, Buckeye police officers appear to try to revive him -- at which point his face, covered mostly in blood, is revealed. Several voices, apparently those of fellow shoppers, are heard saying, ""Why would you throw him down so hard? All he did was shoplifting and you threw him down like that?"" Another person says, ""They threw him down. He wasn't doing anything wrong."" Two citizens then appear to come to Newman's aid by applying paper towels to the man's nose. Chadd estimated Newman was knocked out for about 10 minutes, all the while gushing blood and handcuffed. Buckeye Assistant Police Chief Larry Hall said Saturday that Newman's case is ""basically in the court's hands right now, as far as the resisting arrest and shoplifting goes."" The department will conduct an investigation to assess whether the actions of the police officer involved in the arrest were ""within reason,"" based on ""our policy and also the law."" He said that probe would happen soon, adding it was ""days away."" ""We may have an independent agency conduct the inquiry, just to show transparency,"" Hall said. As to the criminal charges, Todd Nolan -- the attorney representing Newman -- said his office will conduct discovery procedures Monday with police ""to gather evidence proving my client is innocent."" The suspect himself plans to speak to the media later next week, his lawyer said. Walmart spokeswoman Ashley Hardie said the retail giant was aware of the incident. ""We are concerned whenever there is an incident involving a customer at one of our stores,"" Hardie said. ""We are in contact with the local police and are sharing any information we have with them."" Sanchez described her father as ""a really nice man,"" saying he is a custom furniture maker who preaches through the California prison system. He has raised his grandson from birth and, even while in the hospital, Sanchez said the boy was her father's chief concern. Whatever happens, Sanchez vowed that next year she won't be shopping in the wee hours of the Friday morning after Thanksgiving. ""I will never leave my house again on Black Friday, because I don't want to put my daughter through that again,"" she said, noting her daughter was there to see police standing over her bloody grandfather. ""I'd rather stay home. And if they have Black Friday, they need more security.""

"(CNN) -- When McIntosh High School lacrosse player Caitlin Obrien would feel exhausted and defeated during one of her home games in Peachtree City, Georgia, a quick look over to coach Mickey Beard would change her perspective, and her determination. ""He makes you want to do better and push yourself harder and give it your all because if he could, he would be doing that. And he is doing it, because he comes out here in his condition."" Beard uses a wheelchair, the result of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, which is also referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a neurodegenerative disease in which the brain progressively loses the ability to control muscle movement. The life expectancy of someone with ALS is on average two to five years, with their condition worsening over that time to a possible full paralysis. Beard can still hold his head up, breathe and give his girls the advice and sarcasm they expect. His mind is still as sharp and as witty as ever. But it has been difficult for players like Shelby Durden to see his physical decline. ""I was 10 years old when he started coaching me and it's just hard to see someone you care for have to go through such a struggle every day of his life."" But the girls on his team did not shy away from the heartbreak of what their coach was going through. They embraced it with him, making it part of their lives. They researched ALS and when they learned that there was no cure, they became committed to helping raise money for the ALS Association. Their school and community were soon barraged by bake sales, silent auctions, fundraisers and ALS awareness events. The girls formed their own ""Walk to Defeat ALS"" team, and to help Beard with his medical expenses, they started an annual 5K run called ""Miles for Mickey."" Coach Beard's team . They also pushed to make a difference in Beard's home life, bringing meals to his house, hosting ""Lacrosse Dinners"" and showing up for visits during the off-season. On the field, Lacrosse began to take on a different meaning. Seasons were dedicated to Beard, and the team's rallying cry was for him. They would each wear a red sock on their left leg in his honor. Beard would give them a sarcastic remark, but Shelby knew him well enough to see he appreciated their help. ""I think he is definitely the first one to tell you that he doesn't want all the attention, he just wants us to think of it as his challenge that he has to overcome. But I think it really helped us become a year-round team, because in the off-season we are raising money for ALS and we've just become so close that we've now become a family."" Some girls on the team, like Amanda Lindsey, realized that choosing to get closer to someone succumbing to ALS is worth it, even at their young age. ""Mickey's the first person that I've ever had to watch slip away from me, and it's been hard on me, but I also know that his experience has transformed me into who I am. So even when his physical presence isn't with us anymore, it's always going to be a part of me. That I can carry him with me so other people can see what he was like by seeing what he did to me."" Beard's journey . Beard did not have a choice about ALS. It was a burden thrown his way, which he took on without complaint, but with plenty of sarcasm. His team says you would know something was bothering Beard if he would not joke about it, so he made sure his ALS was a regular punch line for all to hear. But you wouldn't hear Beard complain that life wasn't fair. He didn't even get to choose lacrosse, the sport that he says drives him crazy. ""I don't hate girls' lacrosse. It's just the rules are so frustrating. I got into it because my daughter was playing, and they said they just needed an adult to stand on the sideline and shuffle kids in and out of the game. I told them I didn't know anything about lacrosse, and they took that for a yes."" When Beard found out he had ALS, he stopped working and thought he was finished coaching. But parents would call, saying their daughters would only stick with the sport if he would still coach them. So he continued as best as he could. As his muscles became weaker, he moved from using a cane to sitting in a golf cart on the field. This cart became a popular destination for the girls to hang out and talk about their boy problems. Beard says he was a trapped confidant. ""So I kind of became the team mom, and with a bunch of teenage girls, when you can't go anywhere and you're surrounded, it's a little frustrating, because you hear stuff you don't want to hear."" So there he was, coaching a game he didn't really like, having to listen to all this high school girl drama, and knowing that these were hours of a shortening life that he was not sharing with his family. Then these lacrosse girls pushed even closer. They made a big deal about his ALS, and they would even show up at his house during the off-season, and watch his TV. You might expect some frustration. But for Beard, this became his salvation. Through all this, he did have one choice: whether he was going to share his journey of ALS. No one would fault him for keeping the pain and embarrassment of his condition to just his family. People would understand the desire to face your own mortality in private. But Beard chose to share his journey. He let the girls get close and help carry the load. He doesn't fully understand why he means so much to these girls, but being needed helps him get up each day. Changing his attitude is one of the few things Beard can still do. He references a quote from Jeremy Williams, another Georgia high school coach suffering from ALS. ""He said everybody has difficulties, and it's like the wind. You can't control the wind but you can adjust your sails, and I actually told the girls that, and this being able to come out here with them, it's like that's what I do to adjust my sails, because they give me something to get up and look forward to."" A year ago, the McIntosh Girls Lacrosse team got to the state championship finals, and lost. At the end of this season, they were back in the championship match, ready to finally win it for Beard. They lost again. Both times the team was feeling dejected, until Beard broke the silence. Amanda remembers it clearly: . ""He was the first one after the game to come up to us and be, like, it's not the end of the world, that's not what it was about. It's about the journey that we've been on together and the experiences that we've shared together."" He also sarcastically added that because they lost, he now has to come out for yet another season. With that, the team knew they had really won.","McIntosh High School Girls Lacrosse team rallies around their coach with ALS .

"(CNN) -- The French-Algerian football player stranded in Qatar for the past two years over a pay dispute has been given an exit permit to leave the country. ""I cannot wait to go home,"" Zahiar Belounis, who has given up his claim to money he says he is owed, told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday. ""I have waited for so long and now it has happened. I cannot believe it. ""I am tired and stressed but now I am just looking forward to getting to the airport. ""I want to see my family and get my life back to normal. I want to go home."" During the long-running dispute Belounis, who had expected to receive his exit permit in October, says he has suffered with depression and revealed he had contemplated suicide. The 33-year-old will fly back to Paris on Thursday with his wife and two small daughters. In his only phone call to a media outlet immediately following the announcement, Belounis gave thanks to those who had fought for his cause so passionately. ""I want to thank all those who believed me and gave me strength to get through,"" he told CNN. ""I cannot believe how much support I've had. It has been amazing. ""I just want to say thank you."" Qatar has come under intense media scrutiny since winning the right to stage the 2022 World Cup, particularly over its employment laws -- notably the kafala system, which requires expatriate workers and some visitors to have a residence permit. The Belounis case has prompted the International Trade Union Confederation to demand a change to workers' rights in Qatar. ""A grave injustice is nearly over for Zahir and his family. One man and his family have come to illustrate the conditions faced by 1.3 million migrant workers in Qatar,"" said Sharan Burrow, General Secretary, ITUC, in a statement. ""The torment that Zahir and his family have been put through because of bad laws which give workers no rights should never be repeated. ""Sadly, today in Qatar there remain many workers who have no voice. The Qatar authorities should reform their laws to respect International Labor Organization conditions."" FIFPro, the global players union, is set to visit Qatar this week for talks with the country's football authorities and organizers of the 2022 World Cup. Representatives from the organization had been scheduled to meet with Belounis before the news of his exit visa was announced. ""As the worldwide representative for professional footballers, FIFPro will be able to welcome back a long-lost family member,"" said FIFPro in a statement. ""The World Footballers' Association would also like to express its gratitude to all who joined together with FIFPro to ensure a successful outcome."" Neither the Qatari Foreign Ministiry nor the Qatari Football Association was not immediately available for comment, but in October the QFA told CNN that ""as in any other football association in the world, there will unfortunately always be contractual disputes between clubs and players/coaches."" It went on to add: ""It is also relevant to emphasize that up to now the player has not taken any action in front of the competent judicial bodies of FIFA. ""Our records show also that Zahir Belounis received salaries from one of our other affiliated clubs, Al Markhiya Club, when he played there during the second half of the 2011/12 season. ""At the end of that season, Zahir Belounis contacted the QFA for outstanding salaries from Al Markhiya Club. The QFA immediately took action and, after analysis and investigation which gave him right, the player received full compensation. ""However, in the alleged case of El Jaish Club, Zahir Belounis did not contact QFA, although he had experienced the efficiency of doing so when his request was legitimate."" On Tuesday, FIFA President Sepp Blatter condemned European media for ""attacking"" and ""criticizing"" Qatar. ""It is not fair when the international media and especially European media are taking up the focus of an Arab country here in Asia, and attacking, criticizing this country,"" Blatter said to delegates at the Asian Football Confederation awards in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""We are defending it. We have taken the decision to play a World Cup in the Arab world and we have taken the decision to play in Qatar and we will go and play this ... in 2022 in Qatar,"" Blatter added. Earlier this month, the FIFA boss condemned working conditions in Qatar as ""unacceptable"" following an Amnesty International report which claimed migrant worker abuse was rife. ""Economic and political leaders must contribute to improving the unacceptable situation in Qatar,"" Blatter said in a statement on November 21. ""I am convinced that Qatar is taking the situation very seriously. These very discussions about Qatar show just what an important role football can play in generating publicity and thus bringing about change."" Mahdi Belounis, the brother of Zahir, is now looking forward to meeting his brother at the airport and being reunited with his sibling. ""This is fantastic news,"" he told CNN. ""He wanted to say thank you to all the people who had shown him support on Twitter and Facebook. ""This has been really traumatic for all of us -- for my mother and my disabled brother . ""We know he was depressed and that he was on medication and he had talked about suicide. We were really scared of some tragic news. ""He should start from scratch.

"(CNN) -- Penn State University reached settlements over the past few months with what it calls 26 victims of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky -- settlements that will cost the university a total of $59.7 million, the school announced Monday. Of the 26 settlements, 23 are signed and three are agreed in principle, with final documentation expected within the next few weeks, the school said. The school also indicated a few other settlements still could come. ""There was no happiness,"" said Tom Kline, the attorney for a man known as Victim 5 from Sandusky's criminal trial. ""For my client, there was relief."" Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts relating to the sexual abuse of young boys. He's serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence. He has always maintained his innocence and has plans to appeal, his attorney has said. In all, 32 men have come forward to Penn State with claims of abuse. Some of those were rejected for lack of merit, Penn State said. ""We hope this is another step forward in the healing process for those hurt by Mr. Sandusky, and another step forward for Penn State,"" university President Rodney Erickson said in a statement. ""We cannot undo what has been done, but we can and must do everything possible to learn from this and ensure it never happens again at Penn State."" As part of the agreement, this settlement ends the civil litigation for these 26 men. Kline said these victims will not be able to sue anyone else, including Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, where prosecutors say he selected most of his victims. However, Penn State can go after the charity to recoup some of its losses, Kline said. Although the criminal trial involved only 10 victims, more allegations surfaced in the months that followed Sandusky's November 2011 arrest. Abuse as far back as the 1970s has been reported to authorities. Kline praised Penn State lawyers in regard to the settlement process, saying they worked methodically through each claim, making it possible to settle in just about 13 months. Not all the settlements are equal of amounts, Kline said, but were evaluated separately based on when the abuse allegedly happened. Prosecutors have said that Penn State officials -- former President Graham Spanier, former Vice President Gary Schultz, and former Athletic Director Tim Curley -- all knew about two allegations against Sandusky in 1998 and in 2001. The 1998 incident was investigated and dismissed by prosecutors at the time, but the 2001 incident was never reported to police by university officials. Victim 5 was abused six months after that 2001 incident, and so his settlement and others who say they were abused after 2001 had more negotiating power, Kline said. Curley, Schultz, and Spanier are all facing trial this Spring on charges including perjury, conspiracy, obstruction, failure to report suspected abuse and endangering the welfare of children. They also maintain their innocence. The scandal has so far cost Penn State university tens of millions of dollars, including a $60 million NCAA fine, and millions more in crisis management.","$59.7 million divided among 26 ""victims of ...

"(CNN) -- Alleged al Qaeda operative Abu Anas al Libi, accused of playing a role in the deadly bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, denied terrorism charges when he appeared in federal court in New York Tuesday. He told the judge he played no role in al Qaeda's 1998 attacks. We can expect the prosecution to lay out his alleged involvement in detail, provide evidence of his close ties to Osama Bin Laden, detail his computer skills and, crucially, present information about photographs of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi he is alleged to have taken before the attack. What we won't hear is how his trial may benefit al Qaeda today. Libya has oil and is one of Africa's richest nations. In the two years since dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown, Al Qaeda and its Islamist allies have become stronger there. U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers seized al Libi on October 5 from outside his house in the Libyan capital Tripoli. His arrest was followed by the kidnapping and subsequent release of Libya's Prime Minister Ali Zeidan -- an incident he called an attempted coup. The country, according to the justice minister, is on the edge of becoming a failed state. There is no national army or police. Militias like the one that took the prime minister hold sway. Who calls the shots? Who has the real power? It appears that is being determined not through politics but by confrontation; and right now in some parts of the country the Islamists have a strong hand. Al Libi's trial in New York will influence events inside Libya and may provide ammunition to the Islamists. Libya's Justice Minister Salah Marghani says he trusts the U.S. justice system, that al Libi is innocent until proven guilty. But that's the rub. Such a statement angers Libya's Islamists, who are implacably hostile to the U.S. and will use the Libyan government's relationship with Washington as a stick with which to beat it. Most Libyans like the United States and are grateful to it and NATO for help in overthrowing Gadhafi. But in today's increasingly lawless Libya, they are often powerless to speak up. And what does that lawlessness in Libya look like? I found out first hand a few days ago. Filming a huge fire at Libya's foreign ministry, yards from my hotel, we were surrounded by thuggish vigilantes. The man with the longest beard, whom they called ""Sheikh"", was in charge. They had no uniforms or IDs and tried to take us away, even wrestling the car keys from the ignition as we tried to drive away. For a while it felt like a kidnapping. Bergen: Good thing U.S. terrorist hunters weren't furloughed . Eventually an educated passer-by stepped in. A few hours later my camera was returned by the man I'd interviewed the night before. He controls Tripoli's militias and freed the prime minister from his kidnapping just a few days earlier. Within sight of my hotel we'd almost been hauled off and it was a militia, not the government, that had the power to save us. That same militia, I later learned, had a representative in an office at our hotel, a young man with a wispy beard called Sheikh Hamza, who kept a pump action shotgun under his desk. So how does al Libi's New York trial play in to this mess? When al Libi was captured, al Qaeda threatened to kidnap Americans in Libya and target western interests. In the east of the country around Benghazi, where al Qaeda and the Islamists are strongest, and where U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was killed last year, security for westerners has deteriorated. In the past week the Swedish consulate in Benghazi has been attacked and Malta's diplomat, one of the last in the city, has been forced to leave. Al Qaeda is doing everything it can to use al Libi's case to leverage support. They will be watching his trial intently. What do Libyans think about al Libi? Most Libyans I met can't understand why America picked up al Libi when they did. They know just how fragile security is in the country and fear the repercussions. Most assume his arrest had more to do with U.S. politics than benefiting Libya. They've heard what his family has said -- that he was out of al Qaeda and living an open life in the capital. Short of evidence to contrary, they will believe that for now. They want him to get a fair trial. But if he is guilty they want him punished -- and they certainly don't want him back if he is still with al Qaeda. They fear the growth of the Islamist factions and frankly wish America would do more to help on that count. What is Al Qaeda's game plan? Judging by past performance, al Qaeda will try to use al Libi's trial to convince as many Libyans as possible that America is interfering in their country. Both al Libi's son and Libya's justice minister have said he should have a Libyan lawyer on his defense team. Such public pronouncements potentially set themselves up for failure that al Qaeda will gleefully exploit. Al Qaeda and its supporters have been establishing training camps in the east of the country for the past two years. They want to turn Libya into an Islamic state and have threatened to destroy European and American interests in Libya as well as develop it as a base for terrorist attacks in Europe. According to one official, such is al Qaeda's ease of operations in eastern Libya, that hundreds of Islamists from neighboring north African nations are gravitating to the area. Libya is unpredictable; anyone who tells you they know what will happen is wrong. The current trend is towards instability and ultimately a showdown between Islamists and more moderate factions. Al Libi's capture has accelerated that process; his trial could bring it still closer. Who are the world's 10 most dangerous terrorists?","Abu Anas al Libi, seized in Tripoli and brought to the U.S., denies involvement in terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies .

"Fukushima, Japan (CNN) -- After talking about spent nuclear fuel rods at Fukushima for more than two years, it is slightly disconcerting to suddenly be a few meters from them. Some 1,500 fuel units to be exact, rest in a cooling pool within the damaged Reactor 4 building. Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), the crippled nuclear plant's operator, escorted a small group of journalists including CNN, into the heart of the building to show us the preparations being made for an imminent and crucial operation. TEPCO says it will start the difficult process of removing this nuclear fuel in the coming days and transport it to a more stable location 100 meters away. Officials say they have done this more than 1,200 times before under normal circumstances. But considering there was an explosion in the Reactor 4 building days after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, these aren't normal circumstances. ""We have removed large debris (from the pool) and cleaned it with a water vacuum,"" said plant chief Akira Ono. ""But there is a possibility that very small pieces of debris were left behind. ""If they are stuck between the channel box and the rack, we may not remove fuel smoothly, which will affect the operation's smoothness. In that sense, we are concerned."" This would certainly be considered one of the more dangerous areas of the plant to work in. Half a dozen men were making final checks to the newly installed crane and hook that would lift the fuel rods from the pool into specially built containers for transportation. All are wearing full protective gear with dosimeters in their left chest pockets to monitor their daily exposure. In the four hours we were on site, our dosimeters showed we were exposed to 0.06 millisieverts, the equivalent of two week's radiation away from Fukushima, a TEPCO official told me. Driving around the plant, evidence of the devastating tsunami is still perfectly clear two and a half years later. Some building structures remain damaged, as steel girders lie broken and untouched. The cleanup operation is so immense that only essential maintenance is tackled. We were also escorted to the H4N tank area, the scene of a recent leak of contaminated water. The plant is home to about 1,000 storage tanks, holding the irradiated water that has been used to keep the nuclear reactors cool. From the 400,000 ton capacity, TEPCO says 370,000 has already been used. Work is also continuing to try and increase the capability of the ALPS water decontamination system, currently a fairly slow process. Close to the ocean front, we were shown the latest efforts to stop radioactive groundwater from seeping into the Pacific, estimated at around 300 tons a day. The tips of yellow and pink ribbons sticking up from the earth indicate where an underground barrier has been constructed. Liquid cement has been injected into the ground to try and keep the water within the plant itself. The coming days will be crucial to the efforts to stabilize the nuclear power plant. TEPCO rejected alarmist comments from some quarters that any mistake in removing the spent fuel rods could spark another nuclear disaster. Ono told reporters on site, ""I believe it's nearly impossible."" Time will tell.","Operators of crippled Fukushima nuclear plant to remove fuel rods .

"Camden, New Jersey (CNN) -- Camden, New Jersey, is not an easy place for a kid to grow up in. Just ask 15-year-old Destinee Williams. ""Camden has this reputation of being dangerous because you can walk outside at 3 in the afternoon and hear gunshots,"" Destinee said. ""Gangs and drugs are a huge deal. Kids get into gangs to feel safe so they won't get killed."" Unfortunately, Destinee has had to deal with too many killings in her young life. ""My father was murdered in Camden last year, and my cousin was murdered (last month),"" she said. ""In the last month, I know of at least three people getting killed. In Camden, I expect it to happen. I'm not surprised anymore."" For many people, the violence in Camden can make it feel more like a war zone than an American city, but the battle doesn't end there. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 42% of Camden's population is living below the poverty line, making it one of the poorest cities in the United States. The New Jersey Department of Education reports that nearly 90% of Camden's schools are in the bottom 5% performance-wise in the state. ""For too long, the public school system in Camden has failed its children,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday, when he announced the state would be taking over the city's schools. ""Each day that it gets worse, we're failing the children of Camden, we're denying them a future, we're not allowing them to reach their full potential."" Camden may seem like a city without hope, but one of its native daughters is on a mission to change its downtrodden reputation and empower its youngest residents. Tawanda Jones started a dance team, the Camden Sophisticated Sisters Drill Team, to entice young girls to stay off the street and do something positive with their lives. Over the years, she has incorporated boys into the team and also started a drum line program. ""People perceive Camden and its kids as garbage,"" Jones said. ""We have so many gifted kids. They want more out of life. There's just nothing in our city to do. Therefore, what happens when a child has idle time and no positive way to channel that energy? They have to find something else. And it just may turn into the dark side."" Through the drill team, Jones aims to teach kids about discipline, dedication and self-respect, things she believes are necessary to survive and thrive in this rough community and beyond. ""Whether you need it for work, you need it for school, you need discipline, period,"" said Jones, 40. ""Drill team is good as far as structure, because you have to be precise. You have to be on point."" Jones also stresses education, as kids in the program have to keep a C average in school. ""If they get too many Cs, we put them on academic probation,"" Jones said. ""We don't want to kick a child out because they're not doing well in school, so on my days off I go to the child's school just to correspond with the teacher. I'll just make sure that the child is doing well or (see) what we can do on our end to help that child get to where she needs to be."" Only 49% of children in Camden graduate from high school, one of the lowest rates in the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Education. But Jones said all the children who've participated in her program -- more than 4,000 kids since 1986 -- have graduated, and more than 80% of them have gone on to college or technical schools. ""I don't think people really understand how important it is to have these children succeed as far as graduating from high school,"" Jones said. ""That's a big deal in our city."" In addition to promoting education, Jones makes it mandatory that children commit to 200 hours of community service a year. They also have to write an essay about how to improve their neighborhoods. ""You have to keep that community base,"" said Jones, who the children call Wawa. ""Keeping your neighborhood clean, helping the elderly, you bring that family feel back to that community. That is what Camden needs."" Jones founded her program when she was a teenager and saw many of her peers getting pregnant. ""I was a teen mother myself, but I had a great foundation. My family was there for me,"" she said. ""They taught me how to love and respect myself, and more importantly, how to work hard. I saw that a lot of girls didn't have any of that, and I wanted to help."" Destinee joined the drill team after her father was killed. ""When my dad passed, I really didn't know what to do,"" she said. ""The outcome of that was me to not act like myself. ... ""CSS changed me a whole lot. It stopped me from going out in the streets, finding bad people to hang with. My grades now are not straight F's anymore. I have a GPA of 3.0. I want to go to college and be a sports manager when I get older. ... Miss Wawa is my second mom, she's the best thing that happened to me in the past year."" Taron Green was on the verge of joining a gang before he became a member of the drum line. He now mentors younger members. ""We're in such a state of poverty and violence that it scares people from us when, honestly, we need the most help,"" Green said. ""The best way for me to describe Wawa is like, if this was Gotham City, she would be Batman."" Jones, who often uses her own money to fund her organization, is still looking for a permanent place for her drill team to practice. She said she knows it's an uphill battle to turn her city around, but she's determined to do it one kid at a time. ""It's bad. But it can get better. I believe that with all my heart,"" she said. ""These kids didn't ask to be here. They didn't ask to be put in this situation. But being that we're here, we have to make the best of this situation, and it's going to take everybody in this community to do it."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- One of the three teenagers accused of setting another boy on fire in Florida in 2009 has been found guilty of the lesser charge of aggravated battery, officials said. Matthew Bent, 17, charged as an adult, will be sentenced July 23, according to Kim Fontana in the State Attorney's Office in Broward County. Bent faces a sentence of four years and five months to 15 years. Bent originally was charged with second-degree attempted murder in the Deerfield Beach attack. The jury returned the verdict Tuesday. The three teens -- Bent, Denver Jarvis and Jesus Mendez -- were accused of pouring alcohol over Michael Brewer and setting him on fire, after a dispute over $40. Brewer suffered burns over 65% of his body and was hospitalized for more than two months. Jarvis and Mendez pleaded no contest and are serving time in prison. Both testified during Bent's trial, according to CNN affiliate WBFS in Miami. Bent did not take the stand, and his defense did not call any witnesses, the affiliate reported. ""I am asking that now, today, 975 days later asking you to hold this young man responsible for his actions,"" prosecutor Maria Schneider said during the trial, according to WBFS. ""You can't orchestrate something then wipe your hands and say, 'Oh they did it! They did it on their own, I had nothing to do with it.'"" Detectives say Bent demanded $40 he said Brewer owed him and, when he didn't pay, Bent allegedly stole Brewer's father's bicycle. Brewer fingered Bent to police, who arrested the teen. The next day, after Bent was released, the three found Brewer and allegedly surrounded him. Police say witnesses told them his attackers called Brewer a ""snitch."" Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that then-15-year-old Jarvis poured alcohol over Brewer and then-16-year-old Mendez used a lighter to start the fire. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack. Mendez has admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a ""bad decision,"" according to an arrest transcript. Brewer ran about 100 yards to an apartment complex pool, where he dove in. Speaking in 2010, he told CNN's John Zarrella that he wished he could deal with his three former friends himself. ""But, it's over and done with,"" Brewer said then. ""I think they're just jerks and they got what they deserved.""","Matthew Bent was convicted of aggravated battery .

"(CNN) -- The sports world was shaken this past year by violence at the Boston Marathon, reminding us of the fragility of peace no matter the place and time. However, marathons in the United States, and the world for that matter, rallied -- bouncing back as they defied fear through running. The drive to keep moving forward is at the very heart of marathon running, and nothing is better than large-scale sports events when it comes to helping people to overcome insecurities and fears together. Peace is an emotionally charged word. It is something that everyone wants, and it is so elusive to so many. I come from Lebanon, a country that has seen more than its share of conflict and war, but it is also a country that embraces life and peace. Many underestimate the power of sports to create real change in society. But in Lebanon, we have seen how sports, and especially running, can have a positive impact on individuals and ultimately on communities and countries. I founded the Beirut Marathon Association 11 years ago and had a firsthand look at how people can unite if given the right platform and a safe, inclusive environment where every individual feels that he or she is a true partner -- a stakeholder -- in the event. TED.com: The art of bow-making . I used to be a marathon runner; running to me came naturally and helped me stay balanced and focused mentally and physically. That all ended on a day in 2001 when I was training with my husband and some friends in Lebanon to participate in the Dubai Marathon. As our run took us to a street filled with traffic, I was hit by a truck and pinned to the pavement. The accident left me hanging between life and death for a while: I was in coma, and came out of it only to spend two years in the hospital. After 36 surgeries, I was able to walk again, but running was no longer possible. As I convalesced in the hospital, the only thought that kept me excited and hopeful was the idea of creating an international running event for Lebanon. If I was not to run again, I wanted others in my country to know the rush of being part of a large-scale running event, to share all the inspiration and positive feelings that result from such an experience. TED.com: Why privacy matters . This was my big dream -- to bring my country together, to concentrate on something much bigger than myself and my pain. The Beirut Marathon Association was created while I was still in the hospital, with the help of supportive family and friends, and the first international Beirut Marathon was held in 2003. That year over 6,000 runners took to the streets of the city and its surrounding area. It was the first time that Lebanon witnessed such a large-scale running event. People took notice. That first race showed that everyone was looking for a way to participate in a national event that did not fall under any specific political affiliation. People were willing to leave their differences behind and to come run together through the culturally diverse neighborhoods of the city and its vicinity. My vision and that of the Beirut Marathon team grew, and we resolved to continue, no matter what the circumstances, because we were excited. We also realized that we were setting an example. This kind of harmony created through sport could extend even further, to other places and to other times. TED.com: An ode to envy . Organizing such an unprecedented running event in Lebanon was not easy. We confronted political and cultural obstacles, among others. We had to build trust and interest little by little. We had to coordinate closely with parties all over the country; we worked with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, with the Lebanese Internal Security Forces, with the Lebanese army, and with all political parties, many private organizations, like municipalities, the Lebanese Red Cross, and others. Through it all, we got a surprising amount of support from public and private institutions and individuals. Many troubles have plagued Lebanon over the past 11 years of our work, but on Marathon day we always managed to bring people together in spite of their differences. We ran for peace after the former prime minister of the country was assassinated. We ran for peace through a government shutdown, protesters' barricades in the city, an Israeli offensive on the country, and internal armed conflicts. Of course organizing our events during those times of conflict required a lot of flexibility and contingency planning. In one instance, we turned protesters who were sitting in protest tents in the heart of the city into spectators who cheered the runners on and who offered them refreshments and water. We were only able to do it because we had earned the trust of all parties in the country and had the support of all the Lebanese. The lesson we learned from all of this is that peace is possible! This year the slogan of our Banque du Liban Beirut Marathon, which will take place on November 10, is ""Run for Lebanon."" It is an affirmation of the power of sport to create a better country, one where differences are tossed aside and similarities are embraced for a more prosperous future. This has been as challenging a year as any other, with the whole region around us going through war and turmoil and with internal political conflicts unresolved. In times of such uncertainty, it is more important than ever to remind people of what is good, and what is important: healthy competition, unity, prosperity, growth, joy, and most of all peace. As in previous years, people responded, and our registration for this year's races has reached more than 36,600 participants from all over Lebanon and the world. Peacemaking is not a sprint, it is more of a marathon. We cannot expect any major change to happen overnight. Strength, stamina and resolve are needed to finish long runs, but the human spirit is capable of great things. I have seen the elusive peace, and I believe that it can become evident to all, one steady step at a time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of May El-Khalil.","May El-Khalil: Boston Marathon reminded us of fragility of peace, but marathons bounced back .

"(CNN) -- A city official in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira told CNN that five members of the Kulina tribe are on the run after being accused of murdering, butchering and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism. The village's chief of staff, Maronilton da Silva Clementino, said Kulina tribesmen took the life of Ocelio Alves de Carvalho, 19, last week on the outskirts of Envira, which is in the far western part of Brazil that bumps up against Peru. Portal Amazonia newspaper reported that the Indians escaped after being held for a few hours in the city's police station. No arrest warrants were issued. Brazilian law does not allow the military or civil police to enter Indian lands, Portal Amazonia reported. It is still unknown how many people took part in the alleged cannibalistic ritual, although several Indians have fled into the jungle fearing prosecution, the newspaper Diario do Amazonas reported. Clementino said the victim was herding cattle when he met with a group of Indians who invited him back to their village. ""They knew each other and they sometimes helped one another. They invited him to their reservation three days ago and he was never seen again,"" Clementino said. ""The family decided to go into the reservation and that's when they saw his body quartered and his skull hanging on a tree. It was very tragic for the family,"" he said. The news of the incident came from the Indians themselves, who apparently bragged about eating the man's organs, Clementino said. Members of the tribe told residents of Envira -- where 190 Kulina families brush shoulders with non-tribal Brazilians -- that they held a cannibalistic ritual in which they cooked the victim's organs, Clementino said. He said Kulina Indians began surrounding the police station where the suspects were briefly interrogated. Villagers told authorities they are incensed by the lack of response from FUNAI, Brazil's National Indian Foundation. ""The family is very frustrated with the law here, which protects the Indians and doesn't help protect us,"" he said. ""They start drinking and local farmers here are afraid who could be next."" Clementino said groups Indians -- often outnumbering police -- pose a security threat to locals. He said the man's family are upset that authorities did not arrive until three days later. But a FUNAI official told the newspaper Voz do Acre that access to Envira is very difficult, requiring long boat or helicopter rides. According to FUNAI, about 2,500 Kulina live in Brazil's Acre state, which borders with Peru, where 450 Kulina live. This remote jungle corridor is known for its isolated tribes. The Kulina are classified as an ""isolated"" tribe but some have contact with the non-indian population. The Kulina are also known for their complex language. FUNAI studies show that Kulina women speak a completely different language from the men. According to FUNAI, there are 460,000 Indians in Brazil and 1,300 indian languages. There are 55 groups considered to live in isolation.","Five members of the Kulina tribe on the run after being accused of cannibalism .

"(CNN) -- Dirty, dehydrated and starving, itching all over with poison ivy and bug bites, 12-year-old Alexandra Bain and her 8-year-old sister Kyliyah Bain lay face-down in a swath of northern Mississippi woods -- their kidnapper by their side. Thirteen days earlier, authorities say the girls were abducted from their Whiteville, Tennessee, home by Adam Mayes after he strangled their mother and 14-year-old sister. And for the last three days, Alexandria and Kyliyah had nothing to eat or drink. Their weary, young bodies were prone, right along with Mayes, about dusk Thursday near a logging road in an area populated with deer and an occasional hunter, but little else. Then a state officer -- one of scores of law enforcement agents who had been working round the clock to find Mayes and the Bain sisters -- yelled, ""Get your hands up."" One girl picked her head up, soon followed by the other. Mayes himself then began to raise his head, all the while holding a 9 mm pistol. ""I hollered 'Gun!' three times to let my team know that there was a weapon involved,"" recalled Master Sgt. Steve Crawford, head of the Mississippi Highway Patrol's special operations unit. ""Then he raised to his knees, never brandished a gun toward any of us or the children, and at that time took his own life."" That single gunshot wound to the head ended a manhunt that spanned several states and involved about 24 law enforcement agencies, said FBI special agent in charge Daniel McMullen. It also captivated the nation, rocketing Mayes from obscurity to a spot on the FBI's ""Ten Most Wanted"" list practically overnight. And most of all, it tore apart a family -- leaving two young girls motherless, but alive. It is ""just a very, very close-knit, loving family. And it's a family that didn't deserve this,"" Rick Foster told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show Thursday, hours after talking to his relieved good friend Gary Bain, who had just learned his two daughters were alive. For all the new details provided by federal and state officials at a press conference Friday in Jackson, Mississippi, many questions remained. Chief among them -- and one that may never be fully answered, with Mayes dead -- is why he did what he did. The two people who may know best, Alexandria and Kyliyah, ideally can ""shed some light"" whenever they ""get to where they can speak, when they calm down,"" said state Department of Public Safety Albert Santa Cruz. But for now, authorities say they are just thankful that the girls are alive. The sisters ""didn't cry"" after Mayes shot himself ""within inches"" of them, seemingly relieved the worst of their ordeal was over Thursday night, said Crawford. After getting a drink of water, they were whisked off by ambulance with two female agents, said FBI spokesman Jason Pack. Then, some time between 2 and 5 a.m. Friday, they were released from Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, hospital spokeswoman Sara Burnett said. ""A lot of prayers were answered when we found these two young ladies to be safe,"" said Lt. Lee Ellington, a state Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Parks officer who was on site when Mayes committed suicide and the girls were rescued. ""At the end of the day, the two young ladies returned home to their father safely, as did all officers."" The saga began April 27, when Jo Ann Bain's husband, Gary, called police to report that his wife and three daughters were missing from their Tennessee home. The Bain and Mayes families are connected through Gary and his former wife, Pamela, who is Adam Mayes' sister, explained Shana Johnson, a lawyer for Adam Mayes' mother-in-law, Josie Tate. Tate has said that Adam Mayes believed the two girls he allegedly abducted were his children. But Brenda Foster firmly denied to HLN that Jo Ann Bain, her close friend of 26 years who was back in school pursuing a degree in elementary education, was ever ""intimate"" with Mayes. Her husband, Rick Foster, explained how the Bains had embraced and trusted Mayes -- with their daughters calling him ""uncle"" and Gary giving him odd jobs and treating him like ""a son."" Even then, authorities say, Mayes violently turned on the family. Police said that his wife, Teresa Mayes, told police she was in the Bains' garage when her husband killed Jo Ann Bain and her eldest daughter, Adrienne Bain. According to a law enforcement source, the two were strangled. Johnson, Teresa Mayes' attorney, said Thursday that her client last saw Mayes and the Bain girls in Mississippi on April 27. Along with her late husband, Teresa Mayes was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping. He had faced an additional count of making a false report, according to arrest affidavits filed in Tennessee. ""I don't want to believe that. I want to believe that she was forced to do that in some way,"" Teresa's sister, Bobbi Booth, told CNN on Friday. Tate calls her daughter Teresa ""as much a victim of Adam Mayes as the Bain family."" ""Teresa was scared of Adam. If she didn't do just as Adam told her to do, she would suffer the results,"" the mother told HLN on Friday. In affidavits, investigators said the Mayeses drove the bodies of Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain to Union County in northern Mississippi, where they were discovered Saturday in a shallow grave behind the house of Adam Mayes' mother in Guntown. It was then that an Amber Alert was issued, seeking the public's help in tracking down the girls and Adam Mayes. The FBI initially noted Mayes had connections to Arizona, Texas, Florida and the Carolinas. Still, they said their main focus remained in Mississippi -- even after the number of tips spiked, from all over the country, after Mayes' inclusion on the FBI's ""most wanted"" list earlier this week. ""He had family there, he had friends there, and that area was the last area where (Mayes) was seen,"" said FBI special agent McMullen, noting a witness reported seeing the suspect there on May 1. ""So that's what kept us there; that's what kept the pressure up on that area, and I think that was critical to this ending."" By Thursday, the reward for information leading to Mayes' arrest stood at $175,000. The tip that ultimately led authorities to him and the girls was not that anyone spotted them, but that an old log cabin behind a church in Alpine, Mississippi, might be a good hiding place. It is a ""very good possibility"" that tipster may take home that reward, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said. Adam Mayes' mother, Mary Frances Mayes, also has been charged with conspiracy to commit especially aggravated kidnapping. Three others have been arrested in connection with the case, a law enforcement source told CNN -- including one for making a false statement and two others for illegal possession of a firearm. One of these is the person who provided Mayes with the gun he used to shoot himself, the source said. While there was some closure Thursday night, officials have stressed that the investigation is ongoing. And that means authorities may try to hold more people accountable for what happened to the Bain family. ""That effort goes on, and additional arrests are possible,"" Bryant said.

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania school board voted to accept the resignations of two school officials who have been accused of sending each other a series of racist and sexist text messages on district phones, the board's attorney said. In a 6-1 vote Tuesday night, members of the Coatesville Area School District board accepted the resignation of Superintendent Richard Como and high school Athletic Director Jim Donato, said the attorney, James Ellison. Copies of their texting conversations were provided to Tonya Thames Taylor, a board member, on August 18, according to a statement released by the school district. Taylor then contacted other members of the board and an internal investigation was launched. Both men were instructed by the district not to report to work, and they submitted their resignations on August 29. The resignations made no reference to the alleged text messages. The board does not believe any other school district employees were involved in the incident, according to the board statement. ""The racist and sexist language expressed by the two men was sickening and obviously unacceptable,"" board President J. Neil Campbell said in a written statement. ""The board followed state and federal laws and moved as expeditiously as possible while simultaneously cooperating with the district attorney."" Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan said the messages came to light as part of an existing unrelated investigation. In addition to the racist and sexist elements, he said, the messages had references to possible money-skimming. Hogan's office is continuing their investigation and would not say if Como and Donato will face any charges. CNN's attempts to reach Como and Donato for comment went unanswered. The school board is working with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission to provide sensitivity training to faculty and staff members in the district, and guidance counselors and mental health specialists are on hand to assist students and staff, the district's acting superintendent, Angelo Romaniello, said in an open letter to the community Monday. ""Although this has temporarily deflated our spirits it will never defeat us. In Coatesville, we know that our diversity is our greatest strength and we are proud that our community is a microcosm of the real world,"" Romaniello wrote. ""We are still Coatesville, and we continue to pursue our noble goal: to provide the best education for all of our students that our money can buy,"" Romaniello said.","A school superintendent and athletic director resign after a controversy over text messages .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Multiculturalism in Germany has ""absolutely failed,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her party's youth wing at a conference Saturday. ""The approach of saying, 'Well, let's just go for a multicultural society, let's coexist and enjoy each other,' this very approach has failed, absolutely failed,"" she said in a speech. The remarks echo a comment she made to CNN last month in response to a question from Becky Anderson about Germany's Muslim population. ""We've all understood now that immigrants are a part of our country, (but) they have to speak our language, they have receive an education here,"" Merkel told CNN's ""Connect the World"" program September 27. Germany's population is about 5 percent Muslim, the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimated last year.

"(CNN) -- While America slept -- or at least while the left ate their organic ostrich burgers, drank their jackfruit-guava-flavored vitamin water and tweeted ""cleverly"" about Marco Rubio's ""Watergate"" -- Canada was preparing to counter a growing threat to the nation. Patriotic members of the Canadian Parliament stood up to political correctness last week by declaring that Canada will not tolerate an influx of zombies. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird even went as far as to boldly state that ""Canada will never become a safe haven for zombies, ever."" Of course, the lamestream media didn't cover this story. They prefer you worry about things like meteors and cruise ships instead of a growing zombie threat. But it's time for Americans to wake up! Canada's zombie preparedness means one thing for us: Zombies will be driven out of Canada and into the United States. And once they are here, good luck getting them out of the country. 'The Walking Dead': Five explosive moments . Sure, some will argue that we can make conditions so tough for zombies that they will self-deport. But I'm not buying it. Why? A few reasons. One, zombies have no sense of direction. Sure, you can point zombies in the direction of Canada and hope they keep walking as a pack over the border, but they're easily distracted. Second, Americans are fatter than Canadians, which means we are more appealing for zombies to eat than our slimmer northern neighbors. Third, and most important, America is the greatest country in the world, so why would a zombie want to live anywhere else?! I know some will dismiss me as an alarmist, but I wonder how you will feel when one these zombies steals your job. Sure, zombie expert Max Brooks, author of the books ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" and ""World War Z,"" informed me that zombies can't be trained to take our jobs. But I have two things to say about Brooks. One, he's part of the liberal Hollywood elite who tries to sell us on the notion that zombies aren't a threat to our nation's exceptionalism. Check out the recent Hollywood film ""Warm Bodies,"" which is a romantic comedy about a girl falling in love with a zombie. Sorry, Max and Hollywood: Zombies don't need a hug; they need a swift kick out of our country. What it takes to make a 'Walking Dead' zombie . Second, just because zombies aren't skilled enough to take our jobs today, what about in the future? The zombie virus could mutate, and before you know it, some undead person is doing your job for half the pay. I, for one, don't want to tell a red-blooded American human kid that his dream of being of a dog-walker is over because some zombie learned how to hold a leash. Plus, keep in mind that if even only a few zombies make it over the border, these ""anchor zombies"" will create more and more zombies. This is a threat to our very existence. I'm not just talking the danger of them eating our brains, which could happen. I'm talking about the greater risk they pose to our federal deficit because they will want handouts from our government. It's just a matter of time until Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York or House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says zombies should receive government benefits. How long after that do you think it will be until these people argue that zombies should be covered under Obamacare?! Keep in mind that zombies far outlive humans, so they will be a great drain on Medicare. Why zombies, robots, clowns freak us out . And we all know where this is all ultimately leading. Two words: zombie amnesty. The living dead will then have an easier path to citizenship than the living. Brooks and I did agree that we need the federal government to respond to the dangers posed by an influx of zombies. (While I'm usually against new government programs, I do support any that will benefit me directly.) But Brooks, in typical liberal fashion, advocates a coordinated global response to the zombie threat. Nice try, Max, but that's just another ploy by you and your elitist friends to get us to give up control of our nation to the United Nations. Not on my watch, buddy. I see these zombies for what they truly are: un-American. They don't speak English, they don't share our values, and they eat human beings. Plus, they're probably all liberals. After all, you can't be pro-life if you eat people. I hope my fellow Americans wake up before it's too late. We need to secure our borders now before we talk about allowing any zombie reform legislation allowing them to enter or remain in our country. If not, then I hope the Rosetta Stone starts teaching us how to speak zombie, because we are all going to need it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Canadian politicians said Canada will not tolerate an influx of zombies .

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old Nevada boy sought in the killings of his younger brother and mother was taken into custody Wednesday morning by detectives, Henderson police said. Adrian Navarro-Canales was found sitting in an open-air food court near the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, close to the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue, about 10:30 a.m., police spokesman Keith Paul told CNN. Detectives arrested him without incident. A judge formally signed an arrest warrant Monday charging the suspect as an adult with two counts of murder. Navarro-Canales was initially thought to have been a possible victim following the killing his mother and brother, but he became a suspect in the case, police said Tuesday. His mother and brother were found stabbed to death in their apartment on Friday, police said earlier this week. Officers were called to the home after a friend and a relative raised concerns when the mother, Elvira Canales-Gomez, 40, didn't show up for work and wasn't returning phone calls. Detectives also learned that the suspect's 9-year-old brother, Cesar Navarro, hadn't been in school since September 17. ""When the woman and her young son were found in the apartment, detectives thought the older son might also have been a victim,"" the police statement said. But over the course of the investigation, he went from being ""a missing person to a person of interest,"" the statement said. By Sunday, detectives decided they had probable cause to arrest him. In the affidavit for the arrest warrant, the Clark County Coroner's Office estimated that the victims were killed the evening of September 17 in their apartment, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. Police believe the teen continued living in the unit with the dead bodies, the station reported. His brother was later found in the apartment's bathtub and his mother nearby with a knife in the center of her chest, the station said.","Boy, 16, was near Las Vegas Strip in open-air food court .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday morning, a strange word suddenly started trending for me on Twitter. The word was Ruzzle. I had no idea what it meant, so I did the smart thing and asked my dog. ""Mikey, what's a Ruzzle?"" Through nonverbal communication, he indicated that it might have something to do with his groin. Though, to be fair, he'd been indicating this for the better part of an hour. And with varying degrees of intensity. So, just to be sure, I Googled this strange new word and discovered that Ruzzle was actually a popular game app for your mobile device. And for some reason -- I still have no idea why -- at 10 a.m. on Sunday, lots of people were tweeting about it. Thus, I had to learn more. But not really. I don't generally care on Sundays. Or wear pants. Nevertheless, a little half-hearted research revealed that this uber-popular word game seemed to be the offspring of a wild and kinky one-night-stand between Boggle and Scrabble. Apparently, things got a little crazy at the bar, there was a shared cab ride and, lo and behold, we now have Ruzzle. The underlying message: Be careful with tequila, kids. After downloading the app and opening a game account (for which I was denied the user name ""RealGilbertGottfried"") I soon learned that Ruzzle consists of three two-minute rounds in which you and your opponent each get 16 letters placed in four rows of four that can be linked together to create words by gliding your finger over the screen at any connecting angle. Like Boggle. Each letter is also given a point value based on difficulty, and some even award extra points by doubling or tripling the letter or overall word score. Like Scrabble. In the end, the player with the most points after three rounds is the one who doesn't get shingles. Obviously, it's a game of high stakes. ""Hi, boss. Yeah, it's Hank. I won't be in this week. What's that? Yes. Ruzzle. Again."" OK, so the player with the most points actually just wins. However, if you're competitive like me, losing is just as bad as a blistering skin rash. Which is why playing my mom was a horrible idea. She always wins. At everything. But I'm a glutton for punishment and told her to sign up so she could give me something to write about and, perhaps, humiliate me in the process. Which she promptly did on her first attempt: 859-805. The ensuing e-mail conversation went like this: . Mom: ""Good game."" Me: ""I've got your good game RIGHT HERE!"" Mom: ""Oh, my, that doesn't sound nice ..."" I'm a particularly sore loser. And she's gone on to destroy me three more times. ""I just want you to play as well as you can, dear."" Constantly getting beat by your mom. Man, what a drag. Since then, I've at least found a way to defeat two random strangers whom I've played against, and this has temporarily restored my limited sense of self-worth. Fortunately, there are plenty more strangers to go around. And ""plenty"" is a bit of an understatement. The maker of the game, Stockholm-based MAG Interactive, boasts that it now has more than 9 million players in over 100 countries. It's also available in 10 languages. I'm currently utilizing the English version of the game because, after 34 years, I've somehow managed to grasp it at a solid third-grade level. Much like one Twittererer who oh-so-intelligently chimed in on Sunday morning with ""...pop a book open. Then you'll stop loosing [sic] in Ruzzle."" Sage advice. For him. So Ruzzle is officially something that matters, and, at press time, it was the No. 4 overall free app in America. It was also the No. 1 word game, apparently beating out Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends and Shared Needles with Friends. That last one might not actually be a game. Anyway, now I'm included among the millions who play Ruzzle. But probably not for long. I get bored easily, and my interest is already starting to wane. Plus, I just keep ""loosing"" to my mom.","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at items trending online .

"Lampedusa, Italy (CNN) -- At the port in Lampedusa, recovery teams continue to fill trucks with the bodies they're still pulling from the sea. More than 190 so far -- and climbing. They are among 500 African immigrants believed to be aboard a boat that sank off the island Thursday in Italy's deadliest migrant shipwreck. The survivors -- 155 of them, mainly from Eritrea -- wait in a cramped migrant detention center. It was built to hold 250 people but houses more than 1,200. Opinion: Europe must be open to refugees fleeing persecution . Germani Nagassi, 30, told CNN he'll never forget what he saw. ""For five hours we were floating, using the dead bodies of our companions,"" he said. ""There is nothing worse than this. There were many children. There was a mother with her four children, a mother with an infant, all lost at sea. My mind is scarred and in a terrible condition."" The traumatic first hand accounts are helping build a picture of why the boat ended up on the seabed of the Mediterranean with most of its passengers entombed below deck. Survivors mourn victims of Italy shipwreck . 13 days at sea . The vessel was packed with hundreds of African migrants. Because of its location as the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a common destination for African refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and shipwrecks off its shores are common. Survivors described spending 13 days on the boat before the engine stopped less than a mile from the small Mediterranean island, halfway between Sicily and Tunisia. Lampedusa: Why tough penalties will not work . There's been criticism more was not done to help, that the Italian Coast guard was too slow to respond, that they spent precious time filming footage of the rescue instead of saving more lives. Hamid Mohammad, 18, swears an Italian vessel spotted them in trouble off the coast, but did nothing. ""The Italian's boat started circling around us. They circled our boat twice, then just went away,"" he said. ""That's when people started to panic."" Fire on board . The boat's captain told the passengers to set fire to clothes and blankets to attract attention. ""He gathered some clothes and bed sheets and lit them. But his container of benzene exploded,"" Mohammad said. The fire then spread and when many of the migrants crowded to one side, the boat capsized, said Italian lawmaker Mario Marazziti, citing survivors' accounts. ""People were screaming as the boat capsized,"" Mohammed said. The lucky few . In response to criticism, the coast guard Saturday defended its response time and said its crews were on site 20 minutes after receiving the SOS call. ""The moment we got the emergency call from the fishermen at 7 a.m. we immediately intervened and started coordinating the rescue operations,"" said coast guard spokesman Filippo Marini . Abrahalli Amare, 23, was one of the lucky few who were eventually rescued. ""We left our country because of hardship, so that we could live in peace and help our families,"" said Abrahalli Amare, 23.

"(CNN) -- Americans hungry for feel-good fine dining are reaping the benefits of the struggling economy. 606 Congress in Boston, Massachusetts, is offering a three-course ""appetite stimulus"" deal for $25. Wine deals, bar menu specials and three-course, prix fixe meals for $25 to $40 are popping up in high-end eateries across the country to lure customers as business and leisure travel dips and diners stay closer to home and make more value-driven decisions about eating out. For Manhattan restaurateur Paul Grieco, sticking to good food and the warm, hospitable philosophy of his East Village restaurant, Hearth, is key to devising dining promotions to combat a 20 percent dip in business from the same period last year. ""Every restaurant out there is leading with the discount, and the consumer -- it's become one big blur. We're all competing against each other -- none of us are coming out winners,"" Grieco said. To differentiate Hearth this winter, Grieco and the restaurant's chef created five winter soups available at the bar for $5 each, paired with $5 glasses of sherry. This spring, Grieco plans to offer $5 spring salads. Hearth's Cucina Povera, a rustic $35 three-course, prix fixe meal featuring entrees such as braised lamb shank, is another offer aimed at budget-conscious diners. ""A year ago, to be honest, I didn't have to hit that three-course menu at $35 a head. Now you have to,"" Grieco said. Grieco said he hopes the special menu items and prix fixe offering will attract more neighborhood diners to Hearth, one of the most expensive restaurants in the East Village. ""You need that neighborhood crowd, and because of our price point, maybe not everyone in the East Village was able to come to Hearth. Well, we need to change that,"" Grieco said. Taking menu price inflation into account, the National Restaurant Association expects the restaurant industry's sales to decline by 1 percent in 2009. A similar drop in 2008 makes for the first consecutive back-to-back decline for the industry since the organization started tracking sales in 1970. ""This is currently the most challenging environment for restaurant operators in several decades,"" said Hudson Riehle, head of research at the National Restaurant Association. While the decline is relatively small compared with other industries, pricier restaurants take a bigger hit in a down economy, and establishments that rely heavily on travelers are likely to feel the economic slump acutely as total travel expenditures in the U.S. are expected to dip by 6.7 percent in 2009, according to the U.S. Travel Association. At national seafood chain McCormick & Schmick's, 35 percent to 40 percent of the customer traffic, on average, comes from business travelers, according to CEO Bill Freeman. Sales through the end of February were down 13 percent from last year. The restaurant is offering a steak and lobster dinner with dessert for $29.95. Increased focus on local promotional opportunities around holidays such as Mother's Day and Father's Day and an enhanced preferred guest program also are part of the company's efforts to drive sales. The preferred guest program allows diners to amass points that can be redeemed for food in the restaurant and some travel-related awards. In Charleston, South Carolina, where many upscale restaurants rely heavily on tourism, those that are coping best are adding value without compromising their price integrity, according to Robert Frash, an assistant professor in the College of Charleston's Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management. ""Rather than lowering their prices or offering coupons and discounts that are inconsistent with fine dining, they're trying to give [customers] a better value. Perhaps where they were priced a la carte before, now it might be more of a prix fixe menu,"" Frash said. The Charleston Grill, in the Charleston Place Hotel, started a dinner at dusk promotion in January. The three-course menu for $39 is available seven days a week to diners who are seated before 6 p.m. Similar value-driven promotions are available at other hotel-based restaurants. 606 Congress, in the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel in Massachusetts, will resume a popular ""appetite stimulus"" menu on April 13. For $25, guests receive an appetizer, entrée special, dessert and a glass of wine. Wine promotions are another customer lure. Patina Restaurant Group, which operates more than 20 restaurants, is wrapping up a wine promotion at East Coast establishments March 31 that gives customers 25 percent off all bottles. The promotion finished a successful West Coast run at the end of February, and the company is now waiving corkage fees at most West Coast restaurants. ""That is something that has been wildly successful ... just getting people in the door,"" said spokeswoman Amanda White. ""We figure if people don't need to pay for wine, they'll spend more on food."" Promotions and sales declines aside, Americans are still dining out, according to Riehle of the National Restaurant Association. ""Restaurants have become so ingrained in American lifestyles now, and the consumer reliance upon them in some cases deems it a much more essential experience than a discretionary experience.""","Upscale restaurants are offering prix fixe menus to attract diners .
Some restaurants have three-course meals for $25 to $40 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Bush administration said Wednesday it opposes a bill that would bring private military contractors overseas under U.S. law, warning it would have ""unintended and intolerable consequences"" for national security. An Iraqi woman walks past a car damaged in the September 16 incident involving Blackwater. Its sponsor, North Carolina Democratic Rep. David Price, said the bill would clear up questions such as those raised by last month's Baghdad shootings involving contractors from the U.S. security firm Blackwater USA. Price introduced the measure in January, and the Judiciary Committee approved the bill in August. The House of Representatives was expected to begin debate on the bill Wednesday afternoon, with a vote tentatively scheduled Thursday morning. But the White House, in a formal statement of policy, said the measure would overburden the military, overstretch the FBI, intrude on prosecutorial decisions and extend federal jurisdiction overseas in ways that would be ""impossible or unwise."" ""The administration welcomes the opportunity to discuss these important issues further with Congress,"" the statement said. The bill would state that contractors working for the U.S. government overseas are subject to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which allows American courts to prosecute crimes committed in a war zone overseas. The act covers contractors ""supporting the mission of the Department of Defense."" But Blackwater is providing security to Department of State officials. Wednesday, Price released a statement calling the Bush administration's objections unfounded. The White House position ""should infuriate anyone who believes in the rule of law,"" the statement read. ""The fact is the administration has an embarrassing track record for investigating and prosecuting misconduct by contractors working in our name. ""This is precisely why we need to clarify the scope of the law and put FBI resources on the ground."" Foreign service analyst Peter Singer of the Brookings Institute -- who has studied the issue -- says the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act has been used once for an Iraq contractor and that was in a rape case. Blackwater's founder and CEO Erik Prince told a House committee Tuesday the company supports Price's measure. The White House said the bill would saddle the FBI with the responsibility of investigating deaths caused by private contractors overseas. It would place ""inappropriate and unwarranted burdens"" on the Defense Department, which the administration said would be required to arrest contractors and support a specially created FBI unit that would investigate killings in a theater of war. ""The administration is concerned that this sweeping expansion of extraterritorial jurisdiction would create federal jurisdiction overseas in situations where it would be impossible or unwise to extend it,"" the White House said. ""The bill would have unintended and intolerable consequences for crucial and necessary national security activities and operations."" Blackwater, the best-known security contracting firm working in Iraq, said its guards responded properly to an attack on a U.S. Embassy convoy September 16. But Iraqi authorities said Blackwater contractors fired indiscriminately at civilians, killing as many as 20 at two scenes in western Baghdad. Another incident raised at Tuesday's session of the House Oversight and Governmental Affairs Committee involved a drunken Blackwater employee allegedly shooting and killing a bodyguard to Iraqi Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi. Prince said the man was fined, fired and flown home from Iraq, and the company later paid $20,000 in compensation to the victim's family. The Justice Department is investigating the case, but no charges have been brought, U.S. officials have said. Prince defended his company's conduct in Iraq. But the committee's chairman, California Democrat Rep. Henry Waxman, said the U.S. reliance on private security firms in Iraq ""is backfiring"" by creating resentment of the contractors among Iraqis. Under an order laid down by the U.S. occupation government in Iraq, U.S. contractors can't be prosecuted under Iraqi law. Prince said he believed that rule should stand. ""I'm not sure any foreigner would get a fair trial in Iraq right now,"" he said. ""I think they'd at least get a fair trial here in the United States.""

"Farsala, Greece (CNN) -- Multicolor blankets and clothes draped over rusty railings serve as a signpost that you've reached the Roma community on the outskirts of town. Disheveled children squeal as they chase one young girl who is gripping a plastic doll with synthetic blond hair. They jump around chanting: ""We want Maria."" Until last week, these were the knee-high playmates of ""Maria,"" the mystery blond child discovered during last week's police raid on this community. After DNA tests showed they were no relation, the couple who were posing as her parents, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulo, were charged with kidnapping. They deny those accusations and say the birth mother was destitute and unable to care for the baby. The police raid, the accusations of kidnapping and the subsequent media coverage has incensed Roma residents at this community in central Greece. The same day our CNN crew pulled up at the gates, we'd had word that another international TV team had been roughed up by Roma men. Bulgarian woman claims she's Maria's mom . A lot of Greek and international coverage of the case has been fueled by stereotypes and old wives' tales, in part portraying the Romas as untrustworthy, thieves and even child snatchers. Press reports even prompted a stiff warning from European human rights watchdog, the Council of Europe. In a written statement it said: """"Such irresponsible reporting can have tremendous effects on the lives of millions of Roma and fuel already widespread violent anti-Roma movements. ""Although the Roma are no more inclined to criminal behavior than anybody else, media insistence on mentioning ethnicity in news reports gives credence to the myth that Roma are by nature criminals."" On the outer margins of society . It was already dusk when we arrived. Before we could even start to try and get the facts of a complex case straight, we had to persuade the Roma to tolerate us, if not welcome us into their community. Even in the best of times, Roma view outsiders with deep distrust. In Greece, they call non-Roma ""balame."" Centuries of persecution, including thousands gassed in Nazi Germany's death camps, has pushed the Roma to the outer margins of European society. The European Union estimates that of about 12 million Roma spread across Europe, almost 90% survive below the poverty line. Photo blog: Plight of the Roma . Here in Farsala's Roma community, no one we talked to had regular jobs. Some traveled from town to town selling fruit and vegetables. Others collected scrap metal. Those who had previously picked up farm jobs at harvest time said they were having a tough time because Albanians and Bulgarians were coming in and working for as little as 10 euros a day, way cheaper than the Roma. Resident Argyris Tsakiris conceded some of the youngsters did bend the law as they battled to survive Greece's economic meltdown. But like his neighbors, he vehemently denied anyone here was involved in serious crime, much less child trafficking. ""People just don't have enough to eat; what can they do? Ten or 15 years ago, this wasn't the case. Now they don't have enough food, and they go crazy,"" he said. An invitation to visit a Roma family . Before we left the Roma community that evening, we had managed to talk our way into a lunch invitation the next day with his wife, Vassiliki Tsakiris, and part of her extended family, which included four children and nine grandchildren. Argyris had supported them for the past 37 years playing clarinet at weddings and christenings. But amid Greece's economic meltdown, his bookings were scare. ""What can you do? It's a general problem but I can only hope we can get by,"" he said. Over lunch, Vassiliki explained to us that she, like most of her neighbors, knew Maria and the couple who cared for her. She rejected any suggestions she had been mistreated. ""It's a good family. I've known them for many years; we practically grew up together. Christos used to sell potatoes and fruit and Eleftheria would come here for coffee and bring the little girl,"" she said. Vassiliki said she had never met Maria's birth mother but understood she was Bulgarian. She recalls Maria came to the camp possibly five years ago. Authorities estimate Maria may be 5 or 6. Almost as she was speaking, the lunchtime TV news reported the latest on the case. Her daughter Katerina burst into tears and stopped sobbing only long enough to curse what she called ""police and media lies."" ""Maria was raised very well. She used to bring her here nicely dressed. She wasn't skinny but well-fed. Eleftheria took more care of her than her own children,"" she said. After lunch, we wandered through the narrow alleys that separated the metal, prefabricated huts that made up the community. A short distance away, Maria Kaleas stopped pushing a rickety green cart she used to collect firewood. She, too, had known Maria. ""Maria used to play here with the other children and go to the store with her mum. Maria was not hidden away,"" she explained. ""Her real mother gave her away, and Eleftheria was enchanted by Maria's beauty. She shared the food for her own children with Maria."" Among Greek Roma, a blue-eyed, blond child like Maria is a relative rarity. Those familiar with Roma customs here say having a fair-skinned child is seen as good luck. In fact, Maria and her adoptive parents did not live in the metal huts partly funded by the European Union a decade ago. Their home was a few hundred meters away in a brick and concrete house. Inside a child's bedroom . Initially, Roma who said they were just looking after the house shooed us away and asked us not to film. Later, they recanted and invited us in. They showed us a spacious room they said had been Maria's bedroom. Stuffed animals were laid out on a pink quilt and a coloring book lay open on the floor. Their intention seemingly was to show Maria had been well cared for, but it also seemed unlikely that Maria would have had a room to herself in a one-bedroom house that was also home to 13 other children. Outside, Marinos Panagiotopoulos, son-in-law of the woman who raised Maria, spoke briefly to us. ""Maria was the most beautiful of babies. Her Bulgarian mother left the girl here and my mother in law raised her. ""She had five children already and couldn't raise one more. Originally she left Maria only for a short while but she never came back to get the baby,"" he added. A half-hour drive away in the town of Larissa, we found Kostas Katsavos, defense lawyer for the Roma couple. He said relatives of the family were searching for Maria's biological mother. On Thursday, some of those relatives headed to Bulgaria but could not immediately be contacted by phone. ""From the outset, we have said finding Maria's mother is the key to this case. We are not afraid of what she has to say,"" Katsavos told CNN over coffee at a pavement cafe. Almost as he spoke, Bulgarian police reported they had questioned a Roma couple in central Bulgaria who claimed they were Maria's biological parents. DNA tests have now been scheduled before the weekend, police say, to see if they can resolve the mystery of who is Maria and whether she was the victim of child traffickers or simple the daughter of parents trapped by poverty.","Roma couple has been charged with kidnapping little blond ""Maria,"" who they have raised .

"(CNN) -- Rep. Todd Akin made news this weekend by announcing that pregnancy from ""legitimate rape"" is rare. He further argued that physicians had told him that women who were traumatized in such a way had biological things happen in their bodies to ""shut down"" the ""whole thing"" so that fertilization won't occur. There's so much wrong here that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's start with the basics. The human body is intricately designed and exquisitely evolved to make procreation possible. In fact, some would argue that it's our primary purpose. So you have to understand that everything about our biology is there to make it easier, not harder, for a woman to get pregnant. Women can get pregnant if intercourse happens under water. Women can get pregnant from sex in any position. Women can get pregnant even when they think that they can't get pregnant due to menstruation. If you put sperm near egg, women can get pregnant. Republicans distancing themselves from Akin remarks . There is nothing at all about a woman's mindset that affects this. Women can't wish pregnancy away. If they could, then many teen pregnancies wouldn't occur; few teens want to get pregnant. But think of the larger picture. Women in abusive relationships get pregnant. Women in horrible socioeconomic conditions get pregnant. And, yes, women who have been raped get pregnant. The body doesn't differentiate between ""legitimate"" rape and ""illegitimate"" rape -- whatever that is. The body doesn't know whether the rapist is known to a victim. The body doesn't know if a knife or a gun, or alcohol or drugs (or any combination of them), were used. Every sexual encounter does not lead to pregnancy, but every sexual encounter leads to the possibility of pregnancy. Period. Akin flub puts abortion at center of campaign debate . So why would someone say such a thing? While it's hard to get into the mind of another individual, we can guess. This line of reasoning isn't new. It's been used for the most part to delegitimize the idea that exceptions to abortion prohibitions should exist for rape. After all, if you really believe that abortion is the taking of a human life, then it's hard to suggest that there is any rationalization for it at all. While ethically consistent, this belief is rare in the United States. Even among those who oppose abortion, most people support exceptions for rape and incest. It's hard for a politician who firmly opposes abortion to square this. Such a person wants the support of a majority of people but doesn't want to compromise principles. One option, then, is to find a way to make the occurrence of the problem nonexistent. If pregnancy from rape doesn't happen, then we don't need exceptions in the law. The problem, of course, is that such pregnancies do occur. More than 31,000 of them happen in America every year. Pretending they don't by listening to a few anecdotes won't make them go away. This is what happens when reality gets in the way of our moral convictions. Life is tricky. It's nuanced and complicated and often fraught with contradictions. Contrary to what you read, most people don't have black and white views of abortion. Few believe that it should be prohibited when it might save the life of a mother. Few believe that it should be allowed a week before a fetus is full-term. In other words, relatively few people believe abortion should never be legal, and few believe it should always be legal. This places abortion in the gray zone. That doesn't work well for elections. It also doesn't make for clean philosophical discussions. It certainly doesn't make for good sound bites. A further problem with proclamations like Akin's, though, is what they sound like to women who have been raped. If you believe what he does, then anyone who did get pregnant wasn't ""legitimately"" raped. Moreover, it belies a willful ignorance of science. Rape has occurred in history time and time again. Women get pregnant from it. This is known. There is no debate to be had. Opinion: Why Ryan is not bad for women . Those who support Republicans, and even Akin, in this election believe this to be a distraction and a problem. They're right. History shows that statements like this can turn close elections. A win in Missouri for the Democrats may mean that they retain control of the Senate. Moreover, this will be what we are talking about this week instead of the economy, jobs, or health care reform. That's bad for Romney and Ryan. The good news is that all of this is avoidable. Stick to science. If people did that more, they wouldn't have to claim they ""misspoke"" later. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Rep. Todd Akin said pregnancy from ""legitimate rape"" is rare .
Aaron Carroll says he's wrong: Humans are designed to reproduce .
He says Akin probably aimed to make prohibition of abortions square with an (alternate) reality .

"(CNN) -- Aaron Sorkin's HBO show ""The Newsroom"" represents the reality of working in television news about as accurately as ""The West Wing"" captured working in politics -- which is to say, not at all. But both dramas did something more worthwhile: They expressed the idealism that should animate these careers. And in this time of creative destruction throughout the news industry, it's more important than ever before. That's why ""The Newsroom"" matters. When ""The West Wing"" debuted in 1999, the political arena was suffering from a well-deserved dose of post-Monica cynicism. The smart kids were all making piles of money on Wall Street by surfing the tech bubble, and with the 2000 election looming between Bush and Gore, the status quo of peace and prosperity seemed boring. But ""The West Wing's"" alternate reality -- with a White House helmed by a flinty, New Hampshire-born Nobel Prize-winning economist named Josiah Bartlett -- offered a glimpse into a less gray world, where the dialogue was as sharp as the sense of patriotic purpose. And through at least the first four seasons, written primarily by the show's creator Aaron Sorkin, no matter which party you belonged to, once a week the show reminded you why you cared about politics in the first place. More than a dozen years later, ""The Newsroom"" debuted on HBO (which, by the way, is owned by Time Warner, CNN's parent company). Expectations were high, but the unremitting earnestness of the first season could be off-putting -- especially to journalists -- and made shrugging off the show more fashionable than saying you were a fan. But here's the thing: Aaron Sorkin with a few miles per hour off his fastball is still better than almost anything else on television. Despite the critics, the show's lead character, Will McAvoy, quickly made an imprint on civic debates via social media, even if only as a peripheral fantasy about how the news could be. Played by Jeff Daniels, McAvoy is on a self-styled ""mission to civilize,"" and for all the Don Quixote-meets-Ed Murrow posturing, his message was refreshing amid the high-water mark of hyperpartisan cheerleading that passed for much of cable news between the tea party wave of 2010 and the 2012 presidential election. McAvoy's fictitious prime-time show, ""News Night,"" is revived by dedication to the idea in this quote usually attributed to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: ""Every one is entitled his own opinion, but not his own facts."" Sorkin is often accused of writing ""liberal fantasies"" -- a chorus President Obama joined with a gentle jab at the White House Correspondents' Assocation dinner. But McAvoy's character is bearded a bit by making him a Nebraska Republican, who graduated from the district attorney's office in New York to serve as a speechwriter to the first President Bush before entering the TV fray. His politics are old-school ""I Like Ike"" Main Street Republican, which is to say centrist in the current environment. McAvoy is quick to criticize liberals for their losing ways and the yippie-fueled unhinged extremism in the late '60s that caused the left to lose credibility for decades. But McAvoy's hottest criticism is reserved for the rise of right-wing radicalism, as in this famous diatribe: ""Ideological purity. Compromise as weakness. A fundamentalist belief in scriptural literalism. Denying science. Unmoved by facts. Undeterred by new information. A hostile fear of progress. A demonization of education. A need to control women's bodies. Severe xenophobia. Tribal mentality. Intolerance of dissent. Pathological hatred of the U.S. government. They can call themselves the tea party. They can call themselves conservatives. And they can even call themselves Republicans, though Republicans certainly shouldn't. But we should call them what they are -- The American Taliban."" This intemperate, unvarnished surgical strike drew criticisms of the show in real-world media as well as a congressional condemnation in the show's fictional universe. But McAvoy does not mistake the goal of nonpartisanship for neutrality. Perhaps the biggest narrative risk of the show is its location in the recent past. The first season began with the BP oil spill and hit heights with the shooting of Gabby Giffords and the midterm elections. The second season started in the summer of 2011, with the Republican presidential primaries, and already extends to the outburst of Occupy Wall Street in the early fall. This dynamic indulges a bit of instant nostalgia but also, as Sorkin explained on ""The Daily Show,"" it allows the viewers to know more than the characters -- a neat trick. This kind of transference gave rise to perhaps the most interesting aspect of the show. Between the seasons, the character of Will McAvoy waded into online political debates via Twitter -- courtesy not of an enterprising PR firm, but of an otherwise anonymous 29-year-old working for an airline, who is a major Sorkin fan and an aspiring screenwriter. The @WillMcAvoyACN tribute Twitter handle has attracted more than 58,000 followers, including many journalists with whom he jousts in character. The point is that the character of McAvoy is so well developed that fans can adopt his voice and persona to engage in real debates and make some impact. That's a mark of a fictional character that has come to life. And it indicates how much interest there is in a real-life newsman who would play the role of McAvoy -- razor-sharp, principled and ignorance-intolerant -- in real life. Which brings me to the final reason ""The Newsroom"" matters. At a time when trust in media is declining because of the rise of partisan news, when newspapers seem to be dying every day and online clicks reward stories about celebrity scandals and soft-focus pictures of kittens, ""The Newsroom"" offers an inspirational alternate reality. The PR industry might be bigger than journalism and certainly pays better, so the attraction for young would-be reporters has to be something bigger than a paycheck or job stability. The attraction is a job that comes with a built-in sense of purpose, that sweet soul spot where idealism meets realism. That's what journalism at its best promises to provide. And even though the reality might involve long hours, lots of criticism and little compensation, our democracy depends on it. So spare me the easy cynicism and petty complaints. If ""The Newsroom"" helps inspire a few more talented young people to enter the world of journalism, as ""The West Wing"" did for a generation of politicos before it, that is a valuable contribution to contemporary culture -- and much more than most TV shows would ever promise to provide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: ""The Newsroom"" isn't reality, but it expresses idealism journalists feel .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a new plague racing unchecked across the continent, littering the land with human corpses covered with peeling red blemishes. But it equally ravages horses, dogs, cats, monkeys -- every mammal in its path. And it can mutate. Now be glad you're not a newt, a salamander or a frog -- particularly two species of frogs called Darwin's frogs named after Charles Darwin. Because one of them is now extinct and the other endangered, scientists say. A hyper-aggressive fungus with some changed up DNA is infecting and killing amphibians, and has done in hordes of these frogs, according to a new study published last week in the scientific journal PLOS ONE. One of the species, Rhinoderma rufum, was last seen in the wild in 1980. Its close cousin, Rhinoderma darwinii, which Darwin first discovered on his sailing voyage around the world in the 1830s, is endangered. A few groups of them still live in temperate forests in Chile, in South America, where Darwin found them back then. But now, they are just hanging on. What the disease has not done to kill them, human activity, including tree farming, has. In addition to the distinction of bearing the name of the author of the theory of evolution, the frogs are also the only vertebrates aside from sea horses, in which the male of the species sort of gets pregnant. ""The males care for their young by incubating them in their vocal sacs for at least part of their development,"" the study says. The result is a baby bump. The frogs represent merely canaries in the mine as far as the disease is concerned. Virtually all amphibians can catch it. The fungus -- Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in scientific lingo -- causes a nasty infection. It is called chytridiomycosis, and scientists have said that it is ""the worst infectious disease ever recorded among vertebrates in terms of the number of species impacted and its propensity to drive them to extinction."" And the fungus is genetically flexible. There are many strains of it, with the possibility of new ones popping up. The most virulent one has recombinant DNA. It's basically a mutant.

"(CNN) -- A Texas community near Dallas temporarily became a ghost town, after a nearby pipeline fire, which has been burning for nearly two days, caused it to be evacuated. Police required all residents of Milford, which has an estimated population of 700, to leave, after the underground pipeline exploded early Thursday, sending up orange flames stories high, said spokesman Malcolm Ward. On Saturday, authorities reduced the evacuation zone around the incident site, and said most residents could return home. The Chevron oil company asked that the safety measure be taken, the company said in a statement Friday. A jet black plume of smoke has been billowing up towards the clouds. The statement mentioned not wanting to risk exposing residents to possible effects on air quality in Milford. Workers are trying to stop the fire by emptying the flaming stretch of pipeline 50 miles south of Dallas of the oil left inside. They are setting flares to burn it off. The company has provided hotel accommodations for affected residents, the statement said. The American Red Cross has also set up a shelter nearby, according to the Sheriff's office. Milford's residents are expected to return to their homes sometime Saturday, Ward said.","700 residents of Milford, Texas, had to evacuate after an oil pipeline exploded .

"(CNN) -- A new Miss World was crowned Saturday, and though she competed as Miss Philippines, she hails from the United States. Megan Young, 23, an aspiring filmmaker, took the top honor at the competition, held in Bali, Indonesia. ""No words! Thank you so much for everyone for choosing me. I promise to be the best Miss World ever,"" Young said. Miss France, Marine Lorphelin, and Miss Ghana, Carranzar Naa Okailey Shooter, were second and third runners up, respectively. Young was born in the United States and moved to the Philippines at age 10, according to her biography. The new Miss World is a college student who has appeared on screen as an actress and presenter since she was 15. Young wants to move behind the camera and become a director, according to her bio. Miss World's 127 contestants competed in beach fashion, fitness, world fashion, talent and ""Beauty with a Purpose"" meant to honor charitable work. The top 10 models -- from Ukraine, South Sudan, Brazil, the Philippines, France, Cameroon, Cyprus, England, Italy and the United States -- were announced earlier this week. Protesters in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, denounced the event. In an attempt to appease religious concerns, the pageant scrapped the swimsuit competition and replaced it with less-revealing beachwear attire. Also, the finals were originally to be held on the outskirts of Jakarta, but protesters forced the event to relocate to the Hindu resort island of Bali. CNN's Neda Farshbaf, Mary Primiano, Kathy Quiano and Madison Park contributed to this report.","Miss Philippines Megan Young is crowned Miss World .

"(CNN) -- In a bid to end rampant poaching, Kenya is implanting microchips in every rhino nationwide, an extensive process that will include sedating hundreds of animals. Decimated by illegal killings, the endangered rhino is increasingly under attack by poachers using high-tech, sophisticated technology. The microchips will allow wildlife officials to track the animals and trace poached horns. ""It's a costly and time-consuming process to get the chips on the rhinos,"" said Robert Magori, the World Wildlife Fund communications director for eastern and southern Africa. ""The rhinos have to be tracked, identified, sedated, fitted with two chips each (on the horn and on the animal), revived and finally released."" Kenya has 631 black rhinos and a total population of 1,030 rhinos, he said. The animals are part of the big five that draw tourists, a major source of revenue for the east African nation. The other four are the lion, elephant, leopard and buffalo. More money, more problems . Poaching of the rhino horn is a lucrative industry, with much of the loot sold to the affluent in Asia, particularly China and Vietnam. In those countries, some believe the horns can cure a series of ills, including cancer and hangovers, and can boost virility. A kilogram fetches about $20,000, according to a report by Moses Montesh, a criminology professor at the University of South Africa. A single horn weighs about 10 kilograms (22 pounds). In Kenya, each rhino will get two microchips -- one in the horn and another one in an unidentified part of the animal. The microchip is less than 2 inches long and can barely be traced by poachers, Magori said. The fitting process is expected to take up to four months. ""With poachers getting more sophisticated in their approach, it is vital that conservation efforts embrace the use of more sophisticated technology to counter the killing of wildlife,"" WWF Kenya said in a statement. Struggling to keep up . Organized crime syndicates are using military-grade helicopters, night-vision equipment and guns fitted with silencers, taking rhino poaching to a whole new level and leaving conservationists struggling to keep up. Nations such as South Africa and Kenya have invested in unmanned drones, sniffer dogs and increased security, but have failed to halt the rising tide of rhino slaughter. In addition to the microchips, the organization will use forensic DNA technology to identify the animals. ""This will serve to strengthen rhino monitoring, protect the animals on site and also support anti-trafficking mechanisms nationally and regionally,"" WWF Kenya said. Evidence of poaching . Once the systems are set up, every rhino nationwide will be traceable, providing investigators with evidence in cases of poaching and making it easier to prosecute suspects. Rhino poaching soared by 43% between 2011 and 2012, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a worldwide network. Last year alone, about 745 rhinos were poached throughout Africa -- the highest number in two decades. Of those, a record 668 rhinos were killed in South Africa alone. In South Africa, officials are dyeing rhino horns pink and tingeing them with nonlethal chemicals to discourage consumers from buying them. CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report.","African nations seek ways to halt rapid poaching of rhino horns .

"(CNN) -- It's standard fare for a neck-and-neck rivalry game with one second left. Outcome A: Make the field goal and win. Outcome B: Miss it and go into overtime. But there were some factors sweetening the suspense in this one. It was an Iron Bowl, generally an intense matchup, but the winner would claim the SEC West title and stamp a ticket to Atlanta for the conference championship. Then there are the teams, No. 4 Auburn and No. 1 Alabama, which have collectively won the last four national titles, with Alabama owning three of those and mopping the floor with the rebuilding Tigers 49-0 in last year's contest. If it wasn't spicy enough, Auburn's special teams had been on fire, blocking an earlier field goal and partially blocking a punt. Meanwhile, Alabama kicker Cade Foster had been terrible, missing three field goals, including the blocked one, prompting Alabama Coach Nick Saban to trot out a frosh to attempt the game winner. And, of course, the play turned out to be anything but standard when Auburn's Chris Davis invoked Outcome C, catching the ball deep in his end zone, and running it back 109 yards -- including a 15-yard sideline-tightrope scamper as he neared midfield -- for the touchdown. Auburn fans went bonkers, as Alabama fans hung their heads, neither believing what they'd seen. Here are a few of our favorite reactions: . The odd man out . Auburn fans go nuts .

"Washington (CNN) -- The case of a frequent flier labeled a ""frequent complainer"" by one airline will soon get a Supreme Court review, testing consumer rights against corporate prerogatives. The justices will hold an hour of oral arguments Tuesday. Rabbi Binyomin Ginsberg claims his WorldPerks Platinum Elite membership was revoked after being told he had ""abused"" his privileges, repeatedly filing complaints for upgrades and other benefits. Northwest Airlines, which was consumed by Delta Air Lines in a 2008 merger, said it had ""sole judgment"" over the program's general terms and conditions to make such determinations. At issue is whether Ginsberg has a right under state law to bring his case or whether it is preempted by a 1970s-era federal law that deregulated the airline industry. That law prohibits parties from bringing similar state claims against airlines relating to a ""price, route, or service"" of the carrier. Ginsberg is dean of Torah Academy in Minneapolis and travels frequently to lecture and teach. He joined Northwest's WorldPerks frequent flier program in 1999 and reached Platinum Elite statu s-- the highest level-- in 2005. But in June of 2008, Ginsberg claimed a Northwest representative called him and told him his status was being revoked on grounds that he ""abused"" the program, according to court papers. Ginsberg said the airline also took away the hundreds of thousands of miles accumulated in his account. ""It didn't make sense. Initially, when they contacted me on the phone I thought it was a prank call,"" Ginsberg told CNN. ""When I pushed for a reason and clarification, they told me it was because I was complaining too much."" A month after that call, Northwest sent the rabbi a letter noting that he had made 24 complaints in the past eight months, including nine incidents of his bag arriving late at the luggage carousel, according to court papers. ""You have continually asked for compensation over and above our guidelines. We have awarded you $1,925 in travel credit vouchers, 78,500 WorldPerks bonus miles, a voucher extension for your son, and $491 in cash reimbursements,"" the letter said. ""Due to our past generosity, we must respectfully advise that we will no longer be awarding you compensation each time you contact us."" Ginsberg's lawyers countered the rabbi and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on Northwest each year, and that Ginsberg estimated that only about 10% of the trips had resulted in a call to Northwest's customer care. ""I don't think I was a frequent complainer,"" Ginsberg said. ""They should have taken their time and analyzed: Were my complaints legitimate? Should they be doing something to improve their service and quality of product? Instead of worrying, we've got to shut up somebody who is complaining too much."" Later that fall, Northwest sent Ginsberg an e-mail, in which the airline quoted a paragraph from the fine print of the WorldPerks Program. It stated that Northwest could determine ""in its sole judgment"" whether a passenger has abused its program, and that abuse ""may result in cancellation of the member's account and future disqualification from program participation, forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards."" Ginsberg sued for $5 million over a breach of contract in January 2009, but a federal judge in San Diego dismissed the class action suit, agreeing with Northwest that the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA) preempted his claim. The airline's lawyers also argued that the WorldPerks general terms and conditions did not require Northwest to provide frequent fliers with lengthy explanations or reasons for its decision to terminate or demote a member's status in the program. But in 2011, a federal appeals court in San Francisco reversed, and ordered reconsideration of Ginsberg's class action claims. It said that when Congress passed the deregulation law, it did not intend to ""immunize the airline industry from liability for common law contract claims."" ""Congress did not intend to convert airlines into quasi-government agencies, complete with sovereign immunity,"" said the three-judge panel. This dispute turns on a time-tested standard of contract law: the implied ""covenant of good faith and fair dealing,"" the presumption that two parties will deal squarely with each other. Lawsuits are typically brought when one party feels the other is using technical excuses to breach its contractual obligations. That's what Ginsberg's lawyers will claim in Tuesday's arguments. Attorney Adina Rosenbaum says the WorldPerks program in itself is not a ""service,"" as defined by the federal law at issue, and therefore the rabbi's claim is not preempted. ""The word 'service' does not encompass every activity undertaken by an air carrier,"" said Rosenbaum. ""If an airline owned a restaurant, ran a dry cleaner, or managed a sports team, it would not be immunized from following state laws relating to those activities simply because it is an airline. Rather the 'service' referred to in the ADA is the service customers are buying when they buy an airline ticket: the service of providing air transportation."" But the airline counters the ruling from the appeals court was ""nothing short of mystifying."" ""Implied covenant claims ask a court to substitute state law for competitive market forces, contrary to Congress' deregulatory intent"" under the ADA, said Paul Clement, the company's appellate attorney, who will press his arguments before the justices. ""This case arises in one of the discrete contexts in which (the federal Department of Transportation) retains substantial regulatory authority and capacity. If DOT determines that airlines are being deceptive or manipulative in exercising their discretion to remove abusive members of their frequent flyer programs (an unlikely prospect since the programs exist to reward and retain the most valued customers), DOT has authority to act. Absent such a determination, there is no role for courts applying state law concepts of fundamental fairness and decency."" The Obama administration is supporting Northwest. Ginsberg -- who is still a frequent flier, but is no longer loyal to any one airline -- said he is hoping to get his miles back, have his status reinstated, and get fair compensation for what he claims to have endured. ""To me, it's outright fraud. You can't take somebody's mileage away when they've accumulated it,"" he said. ""We live in a country that was built on freedom and this to me is a tremendous abuse of freedom."" The case is Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg (12-462). A ruling is expected by the spring.","Rabbi Ginsberg says he was told he complained too much .

The rabbi lost all of his frequent flier miles as well .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. drone strike that killed the Pakistan Taliban's leader last week won't derail government efforts at peace talks with the group, Pakistan's prime minister said Monday. ""A drone strike under these circumstances has harmed the dialogue and peace efforts of the government,"" Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office said in a statement. ""But we believe that we will not ... allow the dialogue and peace efforts to get derailed."" At a Cabinet meeting Monday, ministers decried drone attacks as ""unacceptable"" and called them a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. ""Diplomatic efforts will be continued to stop these attacks,"" the statement said. ""Given Pakistani peoples' resolve and sacrifices in this war against terrorism, it is incumbent upon the international community to support this endeavor of the government for the accomplishment of peace. The government of Pakistan will not allow any internal or external force to sabotage the dialogue process."" The meeting came three days after a U.S. drone strike killed Pakistan Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud. Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head for his alleged involvement in the 2009 attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan, was killed in northwestern Pakistan Friday, senior U.S. and Pakistani officials told CNN. On Monday, Pakistani jihadists distributed a photograph purporting to show Mehsud before his burial and describing him as a martyr, the SITE Intelligence Group said. New leader elected . An official with the Pakistan Taliban said Sunday that the group had voted to elect Asmatullah Shaheen, who is on Pakistan's most-wanted list, as its interim head. The group, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, will not be making an announcement on a new permanent leader for several days, according to Azam Tariq, a member of the Pakistan Taliban's Shura Council. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to Islamabad was summoned to Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Saturday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry did not explain why the envoy was summoned. A U.S. State Department official confirmed the meeting but would not disclose details about it. Afghan President criticizes U.S. drone strike that killed Pakistani Taliban leader . Pakistan Taliban claimed Times Square plot . The Pakistan Taliban, who have long been conducting an insurgency against the Pakistani government, claimed responsibility for the December 2009 suicide bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. Five CIA officers were among the seven U.S. citizens killed, along with a member of Jordanian intelligence. The group also claimed responsibility for a failed May 2010 attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square. The following September, the U.S. State Department designated the Pakistan Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization. Pakistan has stepped up security, and officials have said they're bracing for reprisals after Friday's drone strike. Pakistan summons U.S. envoy after death of Pakistan Taliban leader . Prospects for peace . Mehsud's death could make progress in proposed peace talks between the Pakistani government and Pakistan Taliban more difficult. A relatively young and charismatic leader, he held together a disparate group with different tribal and other allegiances. His killing may upset some elements within the Pakistan Taliban if they believe that the Pakistani government was involved. The Pakistan Taliban could also pose an increased security threat if they splinter into smaller groups, which could be harder for security forces to detect.

"(CNN) -- The family of Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier captured by the Taliban in 2009, received a letter from him recently -- reviving their hopes that the 27-year-old army sergeant is still alive. Bergdahl's father mentioned receiving the letter in an e-mail exchange with Dwight Murphy, the spokesman for the local POW/MIA group in Boise Valley, Idaho. ""We have received a letter from Bowe through the Red Cross!"" the father says in the exchange. ""He was scripted and redacted but he was no doubt alive and his faculties fully functioning as of two months ago."" He did not say when he got the letter, but Murphy copied and pasted the exchange with the father on his Facebook page after receiving his permission to do so. The father's letter goes on say, ""They are being very careful with him. He is still highly valued at high levels. ""Guantanamo, drones and politics in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Washington are still the big issues."" CNN was unable to reach the father late Wednesday night. The network also reached out to the military and the International Committee for the Red Cross for confirmation, but did not hear back. Last week, the military told CNN it had no reason to believe Bergdahl was dead. In 2012: Parents of captured soldier lead Washington motorcycle rally . Whereabouts unclear . Bergdahl was captured after he finished his guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province in Afghanistan. Since his capture, four videos of the Idaho native have been released. But the last video was sent in February 2011, and it's unclear where Bergdahl is being held now. He was a private at the time. The army has been giving Bergdahl promotions that would have come to him had his army career gone as planned. If he returns home safely, the army will give him all the back pay that he has earned while in captivity. His father has rarely spoken to the media. Bowe Bergdahl, an adventurer and gentleman . Resolution close? In his exchange with Murphy, he said he believed ""we are getting closer to a resolution."" But, he added, there seems to be a disagreement among the Taliban about the direction forward. ""It appears at least several parties want to arbitrate captive SGT Bowe, several others ... want to keep fighting until every single Westerner is out,"" the father said. Last year, Bergdahl's parents led the Rolling Thunder ride in Washington, and said the family holds out hope for his safe return. ""Bowe, your family has not forgotten you, your hometown has not forgotten you. Your state of Idaho has not forgotten you, and thanks to all of you here today, Washington D.C. has not forgotten you,"" his father told a cheering crowd. ""We love you, we are proud of you. Stay strong, never give up. We pray for the day that we welcome you home,"" he said. Flanked by riders wanting to offer support for the safe return of his son, Bergdahl spoke separately to CNN. He sported a long beard and wore a bandana imprinted with ""POW."" His son's official status is listed as ""missing/captured."" ""The beard is a chronology,"" Bergdahl said, ""of my son's captivity since June 30, 2009.""","Letter: ""He was no doubt alive""

"(CNN) -- Next year's college applicants have some difficult choices to make. Is it better to go to state school or private? Stay close to home or ship out to Abu Dhabi? Western students receiving their education in the UAE is not as far-fetched as it might sound as some of the world's most respected collegiate brands have set up outposts in the Gulf region. Dubai hosts 52 universities while Qatar has set up Education City, a sector that houses a number of U.S. colleges including Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Georgetown, and Northwestern. Next year, the first students admitted to New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi will graduate; a benchmark almost as significant as the scheduled completion of the university's new Saadiyat Island campus. ""There are lots of exciting signs that the region is heating up and getting more dynamic in terms of higher education,"" says Phil Baty, the editor-at-large of Times Higher Education. ""There's recognition (in the Gulf) that they need to prepare for the post-oil world, and they realize that a knowledge-based economy ensures growth in the future."" Several local universities have stepped up their game, too, building state-of-the-art research facilities to attract students from abroad. Even Saudi Arabia is getting in on the act. This year witnessed the completion of Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University (PNU) in Riyadh -- a 2,000 acre site and the largest all-female university in the world. In several instances, investment in education in the region has paid off. One of the most prominent collegiate success stories is NYU Abu Dhabi, which started accepting students to its UAE hub four years ago. Read more: Seven-star satire in Dubai . Despite initial fears from critics that the new campus could potentially water down both the brand and the quality of its degree, the Abu Dhabi facility is one of the most selective schools in the world, admitting 150 out of 9,000 applicants per class. Prospective students often have to decide between NYU Abu Dhabi and top tier universities like Oxford and Yale. In recent years, the school has been dubbed ""the world's honors college"". NYU president John Sexton -- the brainchild behind the project -- has lofty goals. ""Our mandate is to create in NYU Abu Dhabi a school that educates the leaders of global civil society, from every sector of the world, and in every sector of society,"" he says. Though the Emirates outpost has, according to Sexton, ""done a great deal to help NYU elevate its game,"" other universities in the area have met with more mixed results. A cheating scandal at the Dubai campus of Edinburgh's Heriot-Watts University earlier this year underscored the concerns that universities with operations overseas are not able to maintain their standards. Other institutions, such as the University of Waterloo in Dubai, had to close because of a lack of enrollment, while Michigan State University curtailed it undergraduate program and now only offers six Masters degrees. ""There have been some examples of market failure, of universities embarrassing themselves and getting it wrong, rather than planting their flag abroad,"" says Baty. ""The issue is, how much are they invested? Are they just about pushing the global brand abroad, or are they genuinely on the ground, creating an infrastructure that will last?"" Even with the success stories, the moral implications of doing business in states with limited freedom of speech and mixed human rights records has left some critics feeling uncomfortable. Infographic: Press freedom in the Middle East . Earlier this year, LSE pulled out of a conference in the UAE (and subsequently witnessed one of its scholars barred entry) after the authorities restricted the inclusion of sensitive topics. Back in Manhattan, some of NYU's faculty members have also expressed concern about the UAE's stance towards gays (illegal) and Israelis (unrecognized). Sexton, however, is unperturbed. ""My experience of the Emirates is that it's a very open society. Now, it's not Greenwich Village but as you move through the world you have to adapt to local customs. My daughter doesn't dress the same way in Istanbul as she does in New York; when I'm in the UK, I'm not as free to criticize public officials as I am in the U.S. You just have to be aware of rules and regulations,"" he says. Leah Reynolds, a senior at NYU Abu Dhabi, agrees with Sexton. Her experience, she notes, is about getting exposure to a wide cross section of cultures, not about imposing her own. ""In my classes, every country we refer to has a case study right there; chances are, someone in the classroom that will have had that experience, no matter what it is,"" she says.","Numerous western universities have outposts in Middle East Gulf states .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force has now identified at least 31 women as victims in a growing sex scandal, a four-star general said Thursday, and there might be more. The Air Force is broadening its investigation to ""actively seek any others that may have been affected by this,"" Gen. Edward Rice, the commander of Air Force Training, said. ""We are taking a comprehensive look not only at the cases that we know, but trying to do the best we can to assess whether or not there are other cases out there,"" Rice told reporters at the Pentagon. Rice said the Air Force had taken ""the unprecedented step"" of shutting down all recruit training for one day to give a written survey to all basic military trainees at Lackland Air Force base. The Texas base has become the focal point of the growing scandal. Air Force base reports more sexual misconduct charges . One trainer has pleaded guilty to having an improper relationship with a trainee, as part of a plea agreement. Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado has been sentenced to 90 days in prison, 30 days hard labor and a demotion in rank and pay. In his plea deal, he also provided testimony against two other trainers who have been charged. He also said he had inappropriate relationships with 10 trainees. The scandal came to light in June 2011, when a young female trainee came forward and accused her male instructor of assaulting her. Staff Sgt. Luis Walker now faces a general court-martial on 28 charges, including rape, adultery and aggravated sexual assault. He is scheduled to appear in court July 16. In November 2011, Rice says several military training instructors, both men and women, overheard a group of male instructors ""talking about incidents that were unacceptable"" and reported what they heard to superior officers. This week, the Air Force brought charges against two more instructors. Master Sgt. Jamey Crawford is accused of giving alcohol to a female trainee and having sex with her. Tech. Sgt. Christopher Smith is accused of seeking to conduct an intimate relationship with a trainee, making sexual advances toward a trainee and carrying on a personal social relationship with a second trainee. ""The basic training environment in particular is a target-rich environment for sexual predators,"" says Anu Bhagwati, a former Marine Corps officer who says the problem goes beyond one branch of service. Bhagwati says there's no such thing as male instructors having consensual sex with young, female recruits. ""You cannot do anything without requesting permission from your drill instructor. You cannot use the bathroom, you cannot move from left to right, you are literally in many cases a robot waiting for permission to take a step. And if you have that relationship which is based on fear and intimidation ... if that's the person you're asking help from, it becomes a very bizarre scenario."" Betrayal of trust? Allegations of rape at West Point, Annapolis . Bhagwati was a communications officer and martial arts instructor in the Marine Corps, and she said she witnessed several incidents of sexual harassment of junior female Marines. ""You are subject to every single order that comes out of that instructor's mouth. If you're not going to tell him, who are you supposed to tell? And how are you supposed to get out of that unit to seek help?"" Rice agrees. ""Personal relationships of any kind between trainees and instructors is strictly prohibited by our regulations and our instructions."" Rice said he does not believe the investigation of 12 instructors at Lackland necessarily means a systemic problem exists across the entire Air Force training command. ""Nine of those 12 were in one unit. We have a total of nine squadrons, and nine of them came from one squadron. So in my assessment to this point, it is not an issue of an endemic problem throughout basic military training. It is more localized."" The Air Force has relieved the officer who commanded the 331st Training Sqaudron during the time these incidents took place. He no longer runs the squadron, but ""remains in the Air Force, in 'administrative hold' at Lackland Air Base, pending his next assignment,"" Rice said. The Air Force said 11% of its military training instructors are women. In response to a question from CNN, Rice said, ""I will look at whether we need to hire more female MTIs, and whether we need to have only female MTIs over female trainees."" The Pentagon estimates 19,000 sexual assaults occur each year. But only 14% of these crimes are actually reported. And less than 8% go to a court-martial. Defense officials say every base is supposed to have a confidential sexual assault response coordinator. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta recently announced special victims units would deploy trained professionals to various bases around the world. These independent personnel would be trained in interviewing victims and collecting evidence of sexual assaults. Female service members sue U.S. military for alleged rape, sexual assault .","Gen.

"Paris (CNN) -- France's first lady is filing a defamation complaint against the authors of a biography published Thursday which claims she had an affair with a former French minister while seeing President Francois Hollande. Attorneys for Valérie Trierweiler, who is not married to Hollande, told CNN the complaint is likely to be filed Friday with the Paris tribunal. Read more: Can France handle truth on sex lives of rich and powerful? In ""La Frondeuse,"" or ""The Troublemaker,"" authors Alix Bouilhaguet and Christophe Jakubyszyn allege that Trierweiler had a longstanding relationship with Patrick Devedjian, a former minister for economic recovery and close ally of former President Nicolas Sarkozy. This relationship allegedly started in 1998 and ended only in 2004 -- four years after her courtship with Hollande began. All of them had other partners at the time. Trierweiler's relationship with Devedjian crumbled after he was unable to commit further to their relationship, the book says -- paving the way for Hollande to step in. Several books have been published about Hollande and his romantic partners since he was elected. Profile: Francois Hollande . ""Trierweiler is an interesting subject matter because she has character,"" Bouilhaguet told CNN. ""It's complicated for a 47-year-old woman to find herself in the Elysée, which has demanding protocol for their first ladies."" Bouilhaguet admitted that she was ""surprised"" by the defamation complaint, adding that the book is an ""open investigation with a true look"" at Trierweiler's personality. In another extract in the book, the authors write that Trierweiler claims Sarkozy made a pass at her at a July 14 celebration in the Elysée Palace, while holding his ex-wife Cecilia's hand. ""You're so beautiful,"" he is said to have whispered in her ear. When she refused his advances, the book says, Sarkozy said to his friends: ""Who does she take herself for? Am I not good enough for her?"" Trierweiler is characterized by this ""abrupt iciness,"" the authors claim, and inside journalist circles at French newspaper Le Monde, she was labeled ""Cruella."" A friend of the couple goes even further and says in the book that Trierweiler is the ""Achilles heel"" of Hollande, who can ""potentially create a lot of problems for him."" TIME: Meet France's unmarried 'first lady' The authors also called the French first lady a ""narcissistic woman, using at once her charms to get what she wants and in the following second, showing her fangs when something displeases her."" Hollande's complex love life -- including alleged animosity between Trierweiler and Segolene Royal, with whom he has four children -- was the subject of two books published this summer. A poll in August suggested that it was at the root of his sliding popularity. Trierweiler was embroiled in controversy in June after she tweeted support for Royal's opponent during the French parliamentary elections.","A new book says France's first lady began seeing Hollande while dating another man .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Thousands of anti-government demonstrators kept up pressure on the Thai government Wednesday by surrounding more official buildings amid the highest tensions the country has seen since deadly unrest three years ago. The protesters in Bangkok continued to occupy the finance ministry building, which they stormed Monday and turned into their secondary command center. They plan to send groups to a range of other ministries and government offices around the capital Wednesday, said Akanat Promphan, a spokesman for the protesters. Their objectives include the public health, labor, industry, social development and science ministries, as well as a government complex that houses multiple agencies, notably the Department of Special Investigation. The number of demonstrators, led by the opposition Democrat Party, has declined from the huge gathering of roughly 100,000 people that assembled in Bangkok on Sunday. Akanat said the protesters believe their current numbers to be in the tens of thousands, perhaps as many as 50,000. But authorities estimate the number of demonstrators to be 10,000, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut of the National Security Council. Certain sections of some roads in Bangkok have been shut down because of the number of protesters camping out and spilling into the street, Paradon said. Amid the tensions on the streets, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra faces a no-confidence motion in parliament put forward by the opposition as it tries to unseat the government through legal means. A vote is currently scheduled for Thursday, but the opposition's chances of success appear slim, as Yingluck's party has a majority. Protesters are calling for an end to the government of Yingluck, sister of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecommunications tycoon who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Critics of the Thai prime minister accuse her of being a puppet of her older brother Thaksin, a deeply polarizing figure who was removed from power by the military while in New York in 2006. He has since lived in exile, except for a brief return in 2008, and was convicted by Thai courts for corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison later that year. More than three weeks of anti-government protests led by the Democrat Party rose to a crescendo with the big demonstration Sunday. The protesters have since taken their rallies directly to government offices, TV networks and military installations. At various points during the past few days, demonstrators have surrounded the foreign ministry, as well as the agriculture and interior ministries. Yingluck has said authorities will ""absolutely not use violence"" to disperse the demonstrators. But the situation is delicate after Thai police issued an arrest warrant against protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. Paradon of the National Security Council said Wednesday that authorities are ""sticking with negotiation"" and trying to persuade Suthep to hand himself in. Authorities have extended the areas around Bangkok where police are enforcing an internal security law that restricts gatherings by demonstrators. The current protests have reanimated the tensions along Thailand's political fault lines -- Thaksin Shinawatra's mostly rural support base on one side, the Bangkok-based elite and middle classes on the other. The same division left the country wracked with turbulence for four years after the 2006 coup, culminating in a 2010 army crackdown on Thaksin supporters that left more than 90 dead. The current protests are in response to a government-backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to Thaksin Shinawatra and opened the door for his return to Thailand. The Thai senate rejected the amnesty bill on November 11, but demonstrations continued, with the opposition calling for the current government to be replaced by a new administration. More than a dozen countries have issued travel warnings for citizens to avoid areas near protests in Bangkok. CNN's Anna Coren contributed to this report.","Demonstrators say they plan to march to multiple government offices .

"(CNN) -- Global wine production is booming with vineyards springing up everywhere from China to the United States, Chile and New Zealand. But when a recent report authored by Morgan Stanley Research predicted a looming global wine shortage, vinophiles took to social media to express their dismay over the bleak news. The report stated that the international demand for wine outweighed production by 300 million cases in 2012 -- dropping to its lowest point in over 40 years. With worldwide consumption jumping by 1% last year, the researchers concluded demand could overtake supply in the coming years pushing the price of wine up. As the viticulture chaos ensued, France's International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) released their very own forecast report that countered Morgan Stanley's analysis. While Morgan Stanley's figures weren't incorrect, per se, their forecast did not take into account 2013's production levels which actually show a return to 2006 production levels, a healthy state of production for the industry. What's more -- Spain, Italy, France and Chile produced record wine levels in 2013. ""It's how you interpret those figures. For all intents and purposes, for those of us in the West who are consumers, no -- there is not going to be a wine shortage,"" says Felicity Carter, editor-in-chief of Meininger's Wine Business International magazine. ""The question is whether there is going to be a wine shortage for consumers in markets that are extremely price sensitive -- like parts of Eastern Europe -- because the cheaper wine that they drink will be diverted to bulk up wine that goes into big consumption markets."" Carter echoes the OIV report pointing to the significant increase in production in EU countries like Croatia, Greece, Hungary and Romania and if vineyards from these areas could find stronger distribution avenues within the international market, there will be plentiful bottles to go around. With poor wine harvests in recent years thanks to erratic weather from climate change, Carter acknowledges this could impact wine production levels. While consumers are not going to see a drastic price difference when purchasing wine from supermarkets, she says it all depends on the region of wine. ""The Burgundy harvest and the Bordeaux harvest this year have been abysmal ... If you wanted wine from the 2013 Burgundy or some parts of France, you're going to have a big problem. You will probably pay a lot more for those wines,"" she explains. ""The question is can you substitute other types of wine for those? Now, the answer is yes."" She adds: ""Morgan Stanley, by the way, were not wrong in what they said. They did use very good figures and they do know what they are talking about but the world of wine is just so complex.""","World is facing a significant wine shortage, according to Morgan Stanley report .

"Washington (CNN) -- We're doing well, President Barack Obama told business leaders Tuesday, but it could be better if not for political hijinks in Washington. In remarks at a Wall Street Journal conference, Obama said policy decisions in his first term in response to the Great Recession had spurred a recovery that could be better. ""America is poised for a breakout,"" he declared, noting that stock markets and corporate profits were ""soaring"" and that ""we are in a good position to compete around the world in the 21st century."" Now, Obama said, the challenge was to ensure opportunity for all to address too-high unemployment and stagnating incomes as growth continues. In particular, he cited the 16-day government shutdown in October as an example of what he called ""self-inflicted"" wounds caused by dysfunctional politics in Washington. ""We have to stop governing by crisis in this town,"" Obama said, making clear he blamed Republicans for a failure to achieve compromise on major issues such as immigration reform and a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement. ""We should not be injuring ourselves every few months. We should be investing in ourselves,"" the President said in advocating a budget approach that includes deficit reduction as well as strategic spending on education, infrastructure and technology. On immigration, Obama noted that the Democrat-led Senate has passed a reform measure that analysts say would grow the economy and shrink deficits. However, House Republicans have refused to bring up the Senate plan. ""You wouldn't turn down a deal that good,"" he said. ""Congress shouldn't, either."" At the same time, the President said he was open to passing a series of immigration reform measures instead of the comprehensive legislation that won Senate approval -- as long as all the necessary components are included. Obama also addressed the major issue of the day, saying the HealthCare.gov website problems have hurt efforts to address the biggest contributor to the nation's debt -- rising health care costs. Asked what lesson he had learned, Obama said that ""we probably underestimated the complexities of building out a website."" He also said the ordeal showed that ""the way the federal government does procurement and IT (information technology) is just generally not very efficient."" ""We probably need to blow up how"" the government contracts information technology services, Obama said. In a lighter moment, Obama noted that some people call him a socialist, and he said to laughter his accusers need to get out into the world more. ""You've got to meet real socialists to know what a real socialist is,"" he said, noting that he advocates a lower corporate tax rate and that the stock market ""is doing pretty good.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two U.S. military Humvees are missing after suspected Taliban militants attacked a transport convoy carrying equipment destined for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, U.S. military and local officials said Tuesday. U.S. military officials in Afghanistan did not have much detail about Monday's attack in northwestern Pakistan, but said the supply convoy was carrying at least two Humvees and numerous water tank trailers. As many as 70 armed militants attacked two convoys within 30 minutes at the Khyber Pass, a mountain pass that links Pakistan and Afghanistan, local officials said. The pass is located in Khyber, one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border. U.S. military spokesman Maj. John Redfield said he did not know how many transport trucks were stolen, but some reports said militants took as many as 13. U.S. military officials are working with Pakistani officials to track down the missing trucks. Local officials said it's believed tribal leaders in the region will hold talks with the militants to try to secure the return of the trucks and their supplies. Khyber Agency officials said some of the trucks seized in one of the attacks were carrying wheat to Afghanistan as part of a United Nations World Food Programme convoy, and one truck contained Humvees destined for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan. Redfield said the convoy had more than 13 transport trucks in it. The Humvees were being carried on a flatbed truck and the water tanks were in container trucks, he explained. No U.S. troops were accompanying the convoy, Redfield said. It was operated by a commercial contract company and was being guarded by Pakistani Frontier Corps troops when the attack occurred Monday, he said. Authorities dispatched two helicopter gunships, which fired on the raiding militants killing one person and wounding another, but could not foil the hijacking, local officials said. The ground route through Khyber Pass is one of many used by U.S.-hired contractors to ferry equipment into the Afghanistan war zone from Pakistan. Over the past year, these ground routes have come under numerous attacks by Taliban and al Qaeda militants, officials said. One raid earlier this year resulted in the hijacking of a truck carrying a U.S. Army helicopter engine. The Pakistani central government has little control in the area, and it is believed to be a haven for militants. The United States uses Pakistan as a supply route because of its major sea port in Karachi. Afghanistan is a land-locked country and the fighting there makes it more difficult to fly in supplies. A suicide bomber struck outside a stadium in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday evening, killing three people and wounding 11 others, the provincial information minister, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said. The blast occurred outside Qayyum Stadium's front gate, where a closing ceremony for the Inter-Provincial Games was being held, police said. The ceremony for the sports tournament was just ending when the blast went off, North West Frontier Province police Inspector General Malik Naveed said. Most people had already left the stadium at the time of the attack, he said. In addition to the three dead, the bomber was also killed, police said. Qayyum Stadium is in the heart of Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier Province on the country's border with Afghanistan. The region is rife with Islamic extremists.

"(CNN) -- Iran executed a man in a rare public hanging in Tehran on Wednesday morning, local media reported. The man, identified only as ""Yaqub,"" was convicted of stabbing a man to death in broad daylight in October, said the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The public hanging, which was attended by the victims' family and large crowds of onlookers, took place in the main square of the affluent northern Tehran neighborhood of Sa'adat Abad. The October murder sparked outrage amongst Tehran residents after videos of the stabbing surfaced on the Internet and were replayed on Iranian state television. The killing took place in front of two police officers, the news agency said. Although executions are common in Iran, public ones are not. A death sentence can be handed down for crimes from murder to adultery. The latest execution brings the total number this year to 20, according to a CNN count from local media reports. On Monday, Iranian authorities hanged seven convicted drug traffickers in the city of Kermanshah, the news agency said. Amnesty International says Iran only trails China in the number of executions worldwide.","The man is convicted of stabbing another in broad daylight, news agency says .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Radical Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has returned to the country after more than three years in Iran, according to Iraqi state television and websites maintained by al-Sadr's followers. The Shiite cleric has been in Iran since early 2007, apart from a public appearance in Iraq in May 2007. He has been studying in the Iranian city of Qom to become an ayatollah, the title given to high-ranking Shiite Muslim religious scholars. Al-Sadr commanded one of Iraq's most formidable private armies after the fall of Saddam Hussein, which contributed to violence and instability in the country for several years. His political bloc has now joined forces with a former rival, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The Sadr movement emerged as one of the kingmakers in Iraqi politics in March, when it won 39 parliamentary seats. The bloc's support played a major role in al-Maliki getting his second term in office.","Muqtada al-Sadr has been in Iran since 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Crew members aboard the International Space Station are awaiting word on how to deal with leaking ammonia from an outside cooling system, NASA said Thursday in a news release. The six-man crew is not in danger, NASA said. The space station crew reported seeing small white flakes floating away from the station, the space agency said. NASA helped locate the leak with external cameras while the crew used hand-held cameras pointed out windows. The leak was in a cooling loop in a solar array that has leaked before. NASA said crew members tried to fix the leak in November. It is unclear whether this is the same leak or a new one. The cooling system could shut down within 24 hours, it said. It is devising a plan to reroute other sources of power so that all systems remain fully operational. Ammonia is used to cool each of the solar arrays that provide electricity to station systems, NASA said. Three crew members -- commander Chris Hadfield of Canada, NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko -- are scheduled to leave the station on Monday at 7:08 p.m. ET. Hadfield asked NASA if the leak will affect the undocking. Capsule Communicator Doug Wheelock said officials at the Mission Control Center in Houston don't see anything that they can't overcome technically, but they would have more information in the morning. Three crew members, NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian counterparts Alexander Misurkin and Pavel Vinogradov, will remain on the space station when the others leave. They will be joined at the end of the month by three new crew members -- NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg, Russian cosmonaut Fiyodor Yurchikhin and European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano, who are due to launch aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on May 28. The space station is operating normally aside from the leak, NASA said.","The ammonia is leaking from a cooling loop on a solar array .

"LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (CNN)  -- A vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment Tuesday. Dubbed the ""Doomsday Vault,"" the seed bank on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world's seed collections, protecting them from a wide range of threats including war, natural disasters, lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management. Norwegian musicians performed Tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault, located 130 meters (427 feet) inside a frozen mountain. Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, placed the first seeds inside the vault, followed by other dignitaries. The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds, with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world. In all, the shipment of seeds secured in the vault Tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons, filling 676 boxes. The shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total, ranging from major African and Asian food staples like maize, rice, and wheat to European and South American varieties of eggplant, lettuce, barley, and potato, according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds.  Watch as ""Doomsday"" seed vault opens »  Eventually the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, as it is officially known, will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world, the Global Crop Diversity Trust said. The Norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near Longyearbyen, in the remote Svalbard islands between Norway and the North Pole. Building began last year. The United Nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity, and countries and foundations provide the funding. ""The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries,"" said Cary Fowler, executive director of the trust. ""At these temperatures, seeds for important crops like wheat, barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years."" The vault's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside. ""We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility,"" said Magnus Bredeli Tveiten, project manager for the Norwegian government. The vault sits at the end of a 120-meter (131-yard) tunnel blasted inside the mountain. Workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees Celsius (just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit), and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area's natural permafrost and the mountain's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 C (25 F). The vault at Svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in Sussex, England, about an hour outside London. The British vault, called the Millennium Seed Bank, is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants, as opposed to the seeds of crops. Paul Smith, the leader of the Millennium Seed Bank project, said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops. ""We must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us,"" Smith told CNN. The idea for the Arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources came into force in 2004, the Norwegian government said. The treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity. Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world. The Norwegian government says it has paid 50 million Norwegian Kroner ($9.4 million) to build the seed vault. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Football fans appear to have a love-hate relationship with the NFL, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. On one hand, most appear unmoved in their views of the National Football League after controversies like alleged bullying between Miami Dolphins players and the murder case involving former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez. Some 75% percent of respondents said claims of racist and violent communications between suspended Dolphins guard Richie Incognito and teammate Jonathan Martin had no effect on their view of the NFL overall. About the same number -- 78% -- said Hernandez's murder case did not shake their views of the league. But about three out of four respondents said that overarching issues of violent behavior and bullying among players are serious enough that something should be done about them. The poll results underscore the complicated way fans may try to reconcile the entertainment value of the NFL with violence in professional football. No issue captures that dichotomy more than concussions. Issues surrounding brain damage, and other potential long-term cognitive and emotional consequences of repetitive brain trauma, are now practically synonymous with the NFL. In August, thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the league in a lawsuit that put the issue under the microscope. The deal calls for the NFL to pay $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to court documents. Head impact sensors: On-the-field placebo or danger? At the heart of the lawsuit was plaintiffs' allegations that the NFL led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks. More recently, former player Tony Dorsett said he struggles with memory loss and personality changes and was told he shows signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The progressive degenerative brain disease has been found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. And former player Brett Favre told a radio talk show that he has had memory lapses. Perhaps because of that attention, 36% of poll respondents said they view the NFL less favorably based on its handling of the concussion controversy. Sixty percent say it has no effect on their views. On the topic of NFL injuries overall: About half of the public believes that something should be done about them, while the other half views them as part of the game. The same number say they view the NFL less favorably when players inflict intentional injuries on opposing players; 50% view that style of play as part of the game. The scales tipped dramatically for respondents when it came to youth football players and concussion; 80% of the public considers concussions sustained by middle school and high school players to be a serious problem. And when asked to weigh two scenarios -- the possibility of having to pay fees for their child to play football, or concussions they could sustain while playing -- 64% said concussions mattered more to them, while only 25% said paying to play was more important. A poll released last month by HBO Real Sports and the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion showed that one in three Americans said that knowing about the damage concussions can cause would make them less likely to allow their sons to play football. High schools tackle football concussions . ""Historically, youth football has fueled the NFL,"" said Keith Strudler, director of the Marist College Center for Sports Communication. ""Parents' concern about the safety of the game could jeopardize the future of the sport."" A report from the National Academy of Sciences, also released last month, found that high school athletes who play football, lacrosse, soccer and baseball were more likely to experience concussions than college-age players. Respondents in the CNN/ORC poll included 843 people interviewed by telephone November 18-20. Of those, 51% identified as football fans, and 8% said they were ""somewhat fans."" Forty-one percent of people polled were not football fans. The sampling error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","Poll respondents say bullying, murder case doesn't affect their view of NFL .

"(CNN) -- On Saturday, ""Doctor Who"" celebrates its historic 50th anniversary with a simulcast special in 75 countries. But it almost wasn't to be. In 1989, the show was canceled. A 1996 attempt to reboot it lasted as long as one TV movie. Finally, in 2005, the show was revived, and its fanbase has grown ever since. News of the 12th Doctor, Peter Capaldi, made worldwide headlines. Fans of the Doctor -- an alien ""Time Lord"" who travels across space and time -- are no longer relegated to fan sites and ""Doctor Who"" conventions. The show is now a high point of each year's San Diego Comic-Con and prominently referenced on shows like ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Community."" It's also the No. 1 rated show on BBC America and won a prestigious Peabody Award this year. That's quite an achievement for a show aimed at children that was quietly launched on November 23, 1963. Marcus Wilson, a producer ""Doctor Who"" since 2011, spoke to CNN about the show's legacy and what fans can expect for the big 50th anniversary episode, ""The Day of the Doctor."" CNN: What do you think it is that has helped the show last 50 years, continuing to grow its fan base? Marcus Wilson: It's a very simple premise, yet it has endless flexibility: A man travels through time and space, fighting for good against evil wherever he goes. It's accessible, uplifting and endlessly entertaining because it engages the viewer's imagination and credits them with intelligence. It can regenerate itself (even its leading man) to keep the show modern and in tune with its audience. CNN: What sets the fandom for ""Doctor Who"" apart from others? Wilson: ""Doctor Who"" fans are the best in the world. They've stayed with the show through thick and thin. They are devoted, smart and not afraid to let us know how they feel! They feel a part of the show, particularly as they kept it alive through all the years it was off air. We're very lucky to have them behind the show. CNN: How has the fandom evolved over the years? Wilson: It's a generational thing. Parents who watched the show as kids are now sharing it with their kids. The audience is constantly renewing. The late teenage/early 20s audience seems to be growing as the classic show is being rediscovered on iTunes and box sets, and the brand spreads from the UK across the world. CNN: How important do you think the ""new"" series has been in attracting fans? Wilson: New material always rewards devotion, but we've tried to develop the show and aspire to new ways of telling stories to keep the show evolving. The show changes to keep pace with the modern world. It's very accessible, deliberately so, so hopefully the great stories, higher production values and superb cast have attracted people who had maybe dismissed the classic series. CNN: What are your fondest memories of ""Doctor Who""? Wilson: As a fan, sitting down on a wintry Saturday night with crumpets to watch Tom Baker's Doctor. As a producer, standing in Central Park shooting, surrounded by a horde of fans. It was quite exciting and humbling at the same time. CNN: Is there anything in particular that you can promise fans when they see the 50th episode? Any teases of what can they expect? Wilson: It's both a celebration of the past 50 years of ""Doctor Who,"" and the foundations of the future of the show. The next chapter starts here. It's both a reward for the long-term fan -- questions will be answered! -- and the perfect place for a new viewer to jump on. A tease? A picture is worth a thousand words. ...

"(CNN) -- Lindsey Vonn is back -- and she means business. The 29-year-old has not competed since suffering a knee injury in February and looked doubtful to ski again this year after tearing a knee ligament last month. Vonn was airlifted to a hospital in February after landing heavily on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria. She underwent surgery for knee reconstruction. But following training runs on Wednesday and Thursday at Canada's Lake Louise course, she is aiming to get back in the groove this weekend ahead of February's Winter Olympics. ""You know if your body is ready or not and I know that mine is ready,"" she told reporters. ""Normally this is the first downhill of the year, so for me this feels like a normal beginning of the season. It feels pretty awesome."" Vonn, who won the World Cup overall titles in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012, is three race victories shy of matching the record of 62 set by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell. She has won 14 times at Lake Louise, including a sweep of all three race titles in each of the past two years. The downhill races are scheduled to take place on Friday and Saturday with the Super-G on Sunday. ""My goal yesterday was to ski solid and to ski my race line and I did that,"" she added. ""I knew that if I could accomplish all those things in one run, then I don't need a second run. It's the smart choice for me to not ski today in order to prepare for tomorrow. ""Lake Louise has always been really good to me and that's why I really wanted to come back here."" With Sochi on the horizon, Vonn knows she must avoid any more injuries if she is to defend her Olympic downhill title in Russia. There she will aim to emulate the feat of fellow American, Picabo Street, who came back the season after reconstructive surgery to win gold at Nagano in 1998. But the U.S. star has played down her chances of success -- instead focusing on ensuring she copes with her troublesome knee problem must be the priority. ""I'm just going to try to make sure things are good with my knee and build confidence every day,"" Vonn added. ""Right now, I'm just going to focus on this particular moment. ""Sochi is quite a ways away. I'm going to just stay focused on my knee and try to get my confidence back.""","Lindsey Vonn aiming to return at Lake Louise on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has suggested that some outside governments may urge rebels to attack international inspectors sent into war-fractured country to secure its arsenal of chemical weapons. ""There might be countries that might ask the terrorists to attack the inspectors to prevent them from doing their job, and blame the Syrian government,"" he said in an interview aired Sunday by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. ""At this point, this remains just a possibility and we cannot know until the inspectors arrive in Syria,"" al-Assad said. Syria submitted an initial declaration to the world's chemical weapons watchdog last week outlining its inventory of the munitions. The move was part of a deal forged earlier this month by the United States and Russia to begin Syria's chemical disarmament. Photos: The omnipresence of Bashar al-Assad in Syria . The plan faces several potential roadblocks. For starters, there is disagreement between Washington and Moscow about how to determine whether Syria is failing to meet its disarmament obligations, according to two sources with knowledge of talks at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The United States wants the OPCW's executive council to decide if Syria is in breach -- in which case a two-thirds majority of member states can make a decision, one source said. The Russians, however, want the determination to be made by the the U.N. Security Council -- where Russia has veto power. Syria has agreed to a Russian-U.S. timeline for the removal of its chemical weapons, but the plan has to be sanctioned as a U.N. resolution. Diplomats have said the Security Council can't pass a resolution without the OPCW first agreeing on how it would be implemented. The plan calls for international inspectors in position to secure that arsenal no later than November. Veteran weapons inspectors have said securing and destroying the Syrian stockpile could take huge numbers of people, including hundreds of inspectors and thousands of troops to provide security. Al-Assad noted that the plan requires his government to ensure the safety of the inspectors. He said the weapons stockpile is secure, despite the civil war raging in Syria. ""Chemical weapons are safely stored to prevent terrorists or groups from other countries from taking them over,"" al-Assad told CCTV. One woman's story: In Syria, inmates suffer the most . 'Large quantities' Asked if it was true that there are more than 1,000 tons of chemical weapons in Syria, he said, ""Syria has been producing these weapons for decades, and it is quite natural that there are large quantities of them. ""We are in a state of war, and we have territories that have been occupied for over 40 years,"" he continued. ""But at any event, the Syrian army was geared toward fighting with conventional weapons."" The United States and other Western nations blame al-Assad's regime for an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people. Russia and Syria say they think rebels used the weapons. Citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons, U.S. President Barack Obama called for authorization from Congress to use military force in Syria. As the United States threatened force to degrade Assad's ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks, a diplomatic opportunity arose between Russia and the United States to put Syria's stockpile under international control. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hammered out the deal in Geneva, and Syria agreed to it.

"Seattle (CNN) -- Amazon on Wednesday announced three new Kindle Fire tablets: a 8.9- and 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX and a lower-end Kindle Fire HD. The tablets feature faster hardware, better screens, improved software and a subtle new look. ""We have always wanted to build hardware that disappears and gets out of the way,"" said CEO Jeff Bezos, who showed off the new products at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. ""When you're reading a book you don't think about the glue and the stitching."" Making hardware that customers can successfully ignore requires a manufacturer pay a lot of attention to hardware. The Amazon team has spent the last year improving its Kindle line inside and out. Faster guts by the numbers . The result is a Kindle Fire HDX that's a beefed-up, sped-up, slimmed-down upgrade to last year's Kindle Fire HD. The third generation of Kindle Fire, the HDX comes in two sizes: 8.9 inches for $329 and 7 inches for $229 (tag on another $100 if you want a 4G connection through Verizon or AT&T.) High-quality screens are key for devices that are built to deliver content like movies and books. The new screens are much higher resolution than the previous Fires. The 8.9-inch tablet crams in 339 pixels per square inch with a 2560-by-1600 resolution screen; the 7-incher is 1920-by-1200 with 323 pixels per square inch. Rounding out the screen improvements, the colors are more accurate and the screen automatically adjusts the contrast depending on how much ambient light there is. The tablet is also faster, elaborate visuals like the kind in video games are smoother and speedier and there shouldn't be any lag when navigating through menus, using apps or enjoying books or movies. The internal hardware making that possible includes a new 2.2 GHz, quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM and an improved graphics engine. For some reason, people continue to take photos with their tablets. Amazon has added an 8-megapixel camera to the back of the larger tablet and included a fat selection of editing and photo tools, like HDR and burst mode. The third new Kindle Fire is the Kindle Fire HD, and its killer feature is a $139 price tag and slightly speedier specs than last year's model. There's stranger on your tablet. He is talking to you and doodling on your screen. Any kid who's ever had to give his or her parents tech support will rejoice at this new, kind of kooky help feature. Mayday is a new tech support option on Kindle Fire HDX tablets, and it's a uniquely Amazon approach to customer support. When activated, within 15 seconds a small box pops up on the screen showing the face of a live, human Amazon customer-support representative. You can see them and hear their voice, and they can hear you and see your tablet's screen. (They cannot see the customer, which should minimize any unfortunate ChatRoulette-style pranks.) They can talk you through simple questions like ""How do I download a new book,"" or more complicated issues such as connecting to a VPN or using encryption. The representative draws arrows and circles on your screen to guide you though your problem, or they can take over completely and navigate through the menus and settings for you. The reps are trained to be very friendly and personable, even chatty. After you've solved your problem, you can stick around and ask them for recommendations on games or books you might enjoy. Only Kindle HDX owners can bring up a live human, and they can do it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for free. Amazon plans on training its existing army of tech support representatives to handle the calls, but will add to its staff if the feature takes off. A Jelly Bean-flavored Mojito . The Kindle Fires run on a highly customized, nearly unrecognizable version of the Android Jelly Bean mobile operating system. This year, Amazon is finally marking the OS as its own and giving it a name, Fire OS 3.0, code name ""Mojito."" The big carousel is still there, showing your most recently opened items. A book or movie is treated the same as a game in Amazon's world. Instead of all your novels being buried in a reading app, their icons exist side by side with apps. Slide from the right in any screen to see a mini, vertical version of your carousel. Get to work . The Fire has primarily been marketed as a content consuming device, a physical portal into Amazon's vast ecosystem of books, movies, music and other goods. In the past year, the company noticed an increase in the number of people using it as a work and productivity device. To make it more workplace friendly, they improved productivity apps like e-mail and document reading and included security features like native VPN support, data encryption and Kerberos authentication. But then stop working and play with these fun features . There are other small features folded into the new Fire HDX tablets. X-Ray, a pop-up companion display that offers up more information on books you're reading and videos you're watching, first debuted on the Kindle Fire HD last year and has been expanded for the HDX. Say you are watching a TV show. Turn on X-Ray and you can see info pulled from IMDB for the exact scene on your screen. It will list the actors you see, trivia or goofs, and show what song is being played. You can even pull up the entire soundtrack for an episode or movie and, naturally, buy it on the spot. If you have a compatible Samsung TV, Xbox or PlayStation, you can turn your big screen into a second screen, watching videos directly from the larger device while you use the tablet for X-Ray exploration or any other task. Misheard lyrics could be stamped out with X-Ray for music. It shows the lyrics for the song you are listening to, as they are being sung. Tap on any word and the song will start playing at that point.

"(CNN) -- Earl Scruggs, whose distinctive picking style and association with Lester Flatt cemented bluegrass music's place in popular culture, died Wednesday of natural causes at a Nashville hospital, his son Gary Scruggs said. He was 88. ""I realize his popularity throughout the world went way beyond just bluegrass and country music,"" Gary Scruggs told CNN. ""It was more than that."" For many of a certain age, Scruggs' banjo was part of the soundtrack of an era on ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"" -- the theme song from the CBS sitcom ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" which aired on CBS from 1962 to 1971 and for decades afterward in syndication. But much more than that, he popularized a three-finger picking style that brought the banjo to the fore in a supercharged genre, and he was an indispensable member of the small cadre of musical greats who created modern bluegrass music. Scruggs was born in 1924 to a musically gifted family in rural Cleveland County, North Carolina, according to his official biography. His father, a farmer and a bookkeeper, played the fiddle and banjo, his mother was an organist and his older siblings played guitar and banjo, as well. Young Earl's exceptional gifts were apparent early on. He started playing the banjo at age 4 and he started developing his three-finger style at the age of 10. ""The banjo was, for all practical purposes, 'reborn' as a musical instrument,"" the biography on his official website declares, ""due to the talent and prominence Earl Scruggs gave to the instrument."" While Scruggs' status as the Prometheus of the banjo may be overstated, many musicians feel he changed the game. The late John Hartford, a noted banjo musician in his own right, was quoted in Barry R. Willis' ""America's Music: Bluegrass,"" as saying: ""Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three-finger banjo pickers have been around a long time -- maybe since 1840. But my feeling about it is that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it."" In an article on the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum's website, bluegrass historian Neil V. Rosenberg described Scruggs' style as ""a 'roll' executed with the thumb and two fingers of his right hand"" that essentially made the banjo ""a lead instrument like a fiddle or a guitar, particularly on faster pieces and instrumentals. This novel sound attracted considerable attention to their Grand Ole Opry performances, road shows, and Columbia recordings."" In 1945, Scruggs met Flatt when he joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys, for whom Flatt was the guitarist and lead vocalist. Along with the group's mandolin-playing namesake were fiddler Chubby Wise and bassist Howard Watts (alias: Cedric Rainwater). Scruggs and Flatt left Monroe in 1948 to form the Foggy Mountain Boys, according to the Country Music Hall of Fame website. Along with guitarist/vocalists Jim Eanes and Mac Wiseman, fiddler Jim Shumate and Blue Grass Boys alum Rainwater, the group played on WCYB in Bristol, Tennessee, and recorded for the Mercury label. He married Anne Louise Certain that year. In the '50s she became Flatt & Scruggs' business manager. They were married for more than 57 years until her death in 2006. The Foggy Mountain Boys' roster changed over the years, but Flatt and Scruggs became the constants, the signature sound of the group on radio programs, notably those sponsored by Martha White Flour, and as regulars at the Grand Ole Opry. They became syndicated TV stars in in the Southeast in the late 1950s and early '60s, and they hit the country charts with the gospel tune ""Cabin on the Hill."" But it was during an appearance at a Hollywood folk club that brought them into contact with the producer of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and led to ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett."" It was their only single to climb to No.1 on the country charts. The 1967 film ""Bonnie and Clyde"" featured their 1949 instrumental ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown,"" with its distinctive Scruggs-style banjo solo perhaps the most ubiquitous of bluegrass sounds. The duo split in 1969, and Scruggs' fame as a solo and featured act continued to grow, even as his most iconic licks echoed through the years among his acolytes -- basically, anyone who played banjo, and many who picked other instruments. Playing ""Foggy Mountain"" on banjo became a staple of Steve Martin's comedy routine, and blossomed into a reverential tribute. In November 2001, Martin and Scruggs were joined by Vince Gill, Marty Stuart, Jerry Douglas and others on ""Late Show With David Letterman"" to play a fiery version of the song -- soloing alternately on banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle, steel guitar and harmonica. Even Paul Schafer took the chorus for a spin on piano. In an article in the New Yorker in January, Martin wrote, ""A grand part of American music owes a debt to Earl Scruggs. Few players have changed the way we hear an instrument the way Earl has, putting him in a category with Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Chet Atkins, and Jimi Hendrix."" Flatt & Scruggs were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1985, six years after Lester Flatt's death. In 1991, Scruggs, Flatt and Monroe were the first inductees in the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame. His sons Gary and Randy both are accomplished musicians and songwriters, and played with their dad in a 1973 album, ""The Earl Scruggs Revue."" People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- In 1996, John Reid Adams received a phone call that changed his life. His oldest brother wanted him to record the movie that was airing on Fox one Tuesday night. ""I just did it to avoid a beating,"" Adams admitted. As the eighth-grader surfed the Internet, he continued to get distracted by the movie unfolding on TV. He saw a British police box from the 1950s -- actually a disguised spaceship known as a ""TARDIS"" -- on the screen. ""This blue box was bigger on the inside! This had to be the maddest thing I've ever seen."" Soon, Adams was hooked on ""Doctor Who."" Seventeen years later, he has become a writer and actor with two ""Doctor Who"" fan films on his resume. He credits the show for many of his friendships and his marriage. All of this because of a show about an alien with two hearts who travels through space and time, keeping the universe safe. Ever since the BBC first aired this little science fiction series for families on November 23, 1963, it's gained a fan base - often called ""Whovians"" - that has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, especially in the U.S. ""It's certainly a broader base now, that's certainly true,"" said Peter Davison, who portrayed the Fifth Doctor in the early 1980s. There have been 11 Doctors in all, with a 12th on the way next month -- though they're all the same character, much like James Bond, but not exactly. People will tell Adams ""how important the program was to them. Perhaps they saw it at a very difficult time in their life and they could identify with the Doctor or the companions in some way, and it became very important to them. And I don't think I've done another program where anyone's said that to me before."" The show is celebrating its 50th anniversary (with the worldwide simulcast of a special anniversary episode, including BBC and BBC America on Saturday), a rare feat for anything on TV, and has shaped the lives of generations of fans. It holds the Guinness Book world record for longest running science fiction television program. A shared love of 'Who' Caitlin Beerer's life was affected quite quickly after being introduced to ""Doctor Who"" in 2011. The Cleveland student was a fan of the show, but that fandom turned into something bigger when she saw that same 1996 Fox TV movie starring Paul McGann (the only episode of ""Doctor Who"" where he was the star up until very recently). ""The Eighth Doctor is completely wonderful and terribly underrated,"" she said. ""I quickly fell in love with him."" She joined Tumblr and dived into the Eighth Doctor community there, soon coming upon a photo of a man named Owen Rickard, portraying the character. Her message to him: ""Marry me. Please."" The two soon began a long-distance relationship driven by ""Doctor Who"" (Rickard lives in London). ""It's been a wonderful journey through time and space, and it certainly didn't take long for us to figure out that we had found soul mates in each other, even though we live on opposite sides of the Atlantic."" Jared Claxon, who goes to fan conventions dressed as the Third Doctor, has a similar story. His future wife saw him in costume at the 2010 EXPcon in St. Augustine, Florida, and wanted a photo with him. ""Throughout the rest of the day we just talked about our mutual love of 'Doctor Who' and science fiction,"" he said. ""'Doctor Who' has a magical quality about it that it can instantly break barriers and give someone hours and hours of conversation. Two weeks later we were dating and we haven't looked back ever since!"" Bonding over 'the Doctor' Just as ""Doctor Who"" has brought people together, it has also kept them from drifting apart. ""Because of my job, we have had to move a couple of times,"" said Mark Tuttle. ""All of them have been hard moves for the kids, particularly with my daughter Bailey. As she constantly had to say goodbye to her friends, her and I became best friends. 'Doctor Who' became the show that really cemented our relationship through our love of the characters that shared a lot of the same stories of travel and loss that we did."" Tuttle spent months writing a 68 page eBook called ""Bailey and the Doctor"" which he gave his daughter for Christmas in 2010. ""There is the lesson that there are those in your life that you'll leave, that will leave you, that will be taken from you and that will just fade away,"" he said. ""But they live in your heart and no one can ever take that from you. Essentially, I was able to use the Doctor to tell her what I as her father couldn't."" They even went to San Diego Comic-Con this year in costume and waited six hours in line to see the ""Doctor Who"" 50th anniversary panel. ""We were in the last 100 people to get into the 6,500 person audience and were the first in the world to see the trailer for the 50th Anniversary special!"" A fandom that has stood the test of time . So what is it that has drawn fans to this quirky show over so many years? ""It transcends genre,"" according to Marcus Hearn, author of ""Doctor Who: The Vault: Treasures from the First 50 Years."" ""It has certainly been a science fiction show in its time, but it's also been a horror show, a comedy, a historical adventure ... even a Western,"" he said. ""It's an institution -- part of the fabric our popular culture."" John Rabon, a fan from Easley, South Carolina, has noticed an increase in the show's popularity lately. ""I've always considered myself a geek and felt the things I liked were pretty exclusive to like-minded people,"" said Rabon, who often portrays the Ninth Doctor in costume. ""However, it feels like in the last few years, the show's exposure led to this massive increase of mainstream popularity."" He says there is a big difference between the small but devoted fan base who watched the show in the 1960s, '70s and '80s and the current, broader fandom that was introduced to the show by the rebooted series in 2005. Some of it could be attributable to the Internet where ""Doctor Who"" memes abound on social media sites like Tumblr. The likable, youthful portrayals of the Doctor, especially by David Tennant and Matt Smith could also explain its appeal to those in their teens and 20s, who may have considered it a ""kids show"" in the past. ""I often hear stories about how 'Doctor Who' has really reminded people to embrace learning and creativity again,"" said author and iReporter Alan Kistler (""Doctor Who: A History"" is his latest book). ""It's great to see a hero who gets so excited by scientific progress and society rising above things like hatred and petty rivalry. It reminds the rest of us what's supposed to matter."" He said the show's family-friendly nature doesn't hurt either, as it can get passed down from generation to generation. The Doctor's lesson plan . To that end, Sarah Townsend, a high school teacher in Hope Mills, North Carolina, incorporates ""Doctor Who"" into her classes. Townsend has been a life-long sci-fi fan, with fond memories of ""Star Trek,"" but she discovered ""Doctor Who"" over the past few years. ""As a teacher, I take this idea of sharing the wonders the world has to offer and bring it to my classroom,"" she said. ""To me, the story of the Doctor embodies many wonderful things we wish to strive for: being a hero, fighting for what is right, making the best out of bad situations, and most importantly, teaching others how to appreciate the wonders that surround us. We are able to take in the wonders and the excitement of the universe.""","TV series 'Doctor Who' has been thrilling audiences since November 23, 1963 .

"London (CNN) -- Two of three women believed to have been held captive in London for more than 30 years met the man suspected of holding them through a ""shared political ideology,"" London's Metropolitan Police revealed Saturday. Police announced Thursday they had arrested a couple on suspicion of being involved in forced labor and domestic servitude after authorities took a Malaysian woman, 69, Irish woman, 57, and 30-year-old Briton to safety from a property in Lambeth, south London. They said the man and woman were both 67 and not British nationals. In a statement Saturday, Cmdr. Steve Rodhouse said the suspects were of Indian and Tanzanian origin and had arrived in Britain in the 1960s. ""We believe that two of the victims met the male suspect in London through a shared political ideology, and that they lived together at an address that you could effectively call a 'collective,'"" he said. ""The people involved, the nature of that collective and how it operated is all subject to our investigation, and we are slowly and painstakingly piecing together more information,"" he said. Rodhouse said the collective somehow ended, but the women continued to live with the suspects. ""How this resulted in the women living in this way for over 30 years is what we are seeking to establish, but we believe emotional and physical abuse has been a feature of all the victims' lives."" Rodhouse said the 30-year-old woman did have a birth certificate, but that was all the official documentation police could find. ""We believe she has lived with the suspects and the other victims all her life, but of course at this early stage we are still seeking out evidence."" On Friday, Rodhouse said that labeling the investigation as domestic servitude or forced labor was ""far too simple"" and that police were trying to understand ""the invisible handcuffs"" that had controlled the women. ""What we have uncovered so far is a complicated and disturbing picture of emotional control over many years. Brainwashing would be the most simplest term, yet that belittles the years of emotional abuse these victims have had to endure,"" he said. Police said Freedom Charity alerted them to the suspects in October after receiving a phone call from one of the victims. ""The woman found the courage to contact the charity after seeing a documentary on television we are informed was aired by the BBC,"" it said in a statement Friday. With the ""help of sensitive negotiations"" by the charity, police met with the Irish and British women on October 25. The women identified the place where they said they had been held, allowing police to rescue the 69-year-old Malaysian woman and take all three to safety, Metropolitan Police said. Freedom Charity spokeswoman Aneeta Prem said the organization took ""immediate action"" to plan a rescue after learning of the women's situation. ""Facilitating their escape was achieved using utmost sensitivity and secrecy and with the safety of the women as our primary concern,"" she said, describing the work of those involved as ""outstanding."" A television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of Freedom Charity prompted the call for help. ""They'd seen me on various news channels talking about forced marriage and dishonor violence, and they said I had a face they trusted, so they called our 24-hour helpline,"" Prem told CNN. She said the process was ""very difficult"" and charity CEO Vineeta Thornhill was personally involved in the negotiations . ""Throughout the process until they were rescued -- so it was over a week of speaking to them -- she gained their trust and confidence, and they believed that when they came out, they would be taken to safety, they would be looked after,"" Prem said. ""These ladies have spent 30 years in captivity as slaves and have come out with absolutely nothing at all,"" she said. ""The road to freedom isn't going to be an easy one."" On Saturday, Prem said Freedom Charity had seen an ""extraordinary"" rise in calls to its help line since news of the case broke. She said the three victims need to ""go through their rehabilitation undisturbed, without being identified.""","A couple is alleged to have held three women captive in London for more than 30 years .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- The men accused in the gang rape and killing of an Indian woman have been summoned to appear in court Monday to hear charges against them, authorities said Saturday. The fatal attack of the 23-year-old woman last month in New Delhi prompted protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. It also stirred worldwide outrage. The suspects will appear in a so-called ""fast-track"" court in a southern New Delhi district, a Metropolitan Magistrates' Court said, according to CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN. Fast-track courts expedite cases in a court system bogged down by red tape. Five men were charged Thursday in a New Delhi court with murder, rape and kidnapping. Companion of rape victim: I begged attackers to stop . Authorities were waiting for the outcome of a bone marrow test before deciding whether a sixth suspect in the attack will be charged as a juvenile or an adult. The trial will begin as soon as all of the evidence is gathered, said Suman Nalwa, deputy police commissioner of a unit for women and children. Indian rape debate: Why death penalty is no solution . The case appears to have prompted changes in New Delhi law enforcement. India's interior minister has ordered the city's police stations to increase the number of women officers to facilitate the handling of complaints from women. Interior Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said Friday that each police station in Delhi should have 10 women constables and two women subinspectors. Read more: The perils of being a woman in India . ""We will be posting these women very soon, according to this order, by diverting staff from other places and making them available in Delhi,"" police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. At present, women comprise 7% of police forces, he said. Candidates will be recruited within four months, and training will take an additional nine months, he said. Bhagat denied that the directive was issued solely because of the rape, but said it is aimed at helping women. 'She could have been me': Action urged after gang rape case . ""We need overall more women in the police station as other women feel more comfortable with female officers,"" he said. ""If all women complaints are attended to promptly, situations like that of the gang-raped medical student may have been avoided."" The interior minister said he is working with security officials to strengthen laws regarding rape and assault. In the state of Haryana, about 80 miles northwest of Delhi, officials plan to publicize the profiles of rapists. The state will publish the names, addresses and case numbers of convicted rapists on a website. ""In doing so, we hope to curb crime against women,"" said Laik Ram Dabbas, director of the state crime records bureau. The website could be active this month, Dabbas said.","The suspects will go before a so-called ""fast-track"" court .

"Washington (CNN) -- Dennis Apel has been a longtime critic of U.S. military policy and for 17 years has protested around Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. ""It's completely immoral what's happening there,"" he says. ""I'm not the threat"" to anyone on the government reservation or its mission. ""They think what I have to say is the threat."" His message of peace and the conflict it has created with Obama administration officials have now taken Apel and his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. At issue is whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for ""peacefully protesting"" on a public road easement along the enclosed high-security facility. While some on the court expressed concerns about the government's claims, a majority of justices at Wednesday's lively hour of oral arguments appeared to offer little support for Apel's free speech and jurisdictional claims. ""If you look at the easement"" agreement between the U.S. and the county, Justice Anthony Kennedy said, ""it makes it very clear that the military commander has authority to exercise control over the easement property."" ""You've got a public school and a public highway"" on the base, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. ""I'm not quite sure how you can keep a person off of lands that the military is not using in its operations."" The appeal presents a fact-specific inquiry into such issues as ""concurrent"" government jurisdiction, public forums and the limits of ""exclusive control"" asserted by the military. A ruling from the court in coming months could offer clearer guidelines for those like Apel seeking to protest on public land, where location is integral to their message. The 63-year-old man and his wife, Tensie Hernandez-Apel, founded Beatitude Catholic Worker House in Guadalupe, California, about a half-hour away from the base, which is along the scenic Pacific Ocean, northwest of Santa Barbara. The high-tech facility launches military satellites, operates aeronautical and space surveillance missions, and tests a variety of sophisticated weapons systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles. Running through its eastern boundary are state Highways 1 and 246, open to the traveling public. The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a ""use easement"" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads. Concurrent jurisdiction gives a measure of control of the narrow strip of land to all three entities. The Apels and their supporters from Pacific Life Community, a group that opposes nuclear weapons, had conducted monthly peace vigils in a special open ""protest zone"" created along the Pacific Coast Highway bisecting the base. A special green line is designed to mark an off-limits area. Vandenberg's commanding officer in 2003 issued a ""barment order"" against Dennis Apel after he was arrested for trespassing and vandalism, including throwing blood on a base sign. A second ""bar letter"" was given four years later, after another trespassing incident. In 2010, with the ban still in effect, Apel again entered the protest zone on repeated occasions, was told to leave, and was then escorted off the property. He says he has been arrested about 15 times. He sought to block the misdemeanor counts on free speech and other legal grounds. A federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor, saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military's ""exclusive right of possession."" The Obama Justice Department then asked the Supreme Court to intervene. At Wednesday's arguments, several conservative justices rebuffed the efforts by Apel attorney Erwin Chemerinsky to make this a predominately First Amendment case. ""When an easement goes towards a public road, that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities,"" he said. Justice Kennedy said the issue was mainly about property ownership: ""You're back on the First Amendment case. It may or may not. If the commander wants to close the base for a rocket launch, he certainly can."" Chemerinsky: ""The United States wants it both ways. They want the benefits of having an easement there, in the sense that the state is responsible for maintaining the road, the state is liable for any harms on the road, and the state enforces crimes on the road. But they also want to claim that they have all of the control over that public road as they would within the base."" But Justice Antonin Scalia interjected: ""They're entitled to have it both ways. It's their base. And if that's the deal, take it or leave it, state: 'We'll give you this easement, but the terms are what we have said.' What's wrong with that?"" Chief Justice John Roberts agreed: ""It's been ceded by the United States for the convenience of the traveling public. ... The military commander has given permission to use the easement."" And Roberts said that even though there has been a protest zone in place since 1989, Apel can still be banned at the commander's sole discretion. ""He does see some kind of threat by allowing somebody in there who's vandalized the base in the past."" Justice Elena Kagan, to Chemerinsky: ""Your argument is sort of a 'use it or lose it' argument, is that correct? That the government has this commanding authority, and unless it uses it to its full extent, every day of the week, it loses it? One of the arguments that the government makes is, look, what the military wants to do here is something very sensible. It keeps tight what it needs to keep tight, but it allows to be more open areas that it doesn't have an interest in securing entirely. And that's for the convenience of military personnel and for other people who live around the base. What's wrong with that?"" As for Apel, he told CNN after the arguments that he was hopeful of prevailing, and continuing his vigils at Vandenberg. ""They're denying my right to dissent on their base,"" he said. ""They're systematically trying to keep me out there, but I'm not going away."" The case is U.S. v. Apel (12-1038). Supreme Court appears split over frequent flyer case .","Lawyer for U.S. military policy critic calls conviction for ""peacefully protesting"" invalid .

"(CNN) -- Levon Helm, the drummer, multi-instrumentalist and singer for The Band who kept the band's heart for more than three decades, died ""peacefully"" Thursday afternoon, according to his record label, Vanguard Records. He was 71. ""He was surrounded by family, friends and band mates and will be remembered by all he touched as a brilliant musician and a beautiful soul,"" the record label's statement said. A statement from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted Helm in 1994, called him the backbone of The Band. ""As a member of the one of the most influential rock and roll groups, The Band, Levon Helm produced music that was as much timeless as it was timely,"" it said. ""In the late 1960s and early 1970s when the country was divided, The Band still projected a sense of unity and brought generations of fans together from all over the world."" Helm had a voice unlike any other in rock music: definitively Southern, soulful and gritty, an oak-barreled whiskey that sometimes went down with a fiery kick. He could be mournful, calling up ghosts, as he did in ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" and the half-chanted chorus of ""King Harvest (Has Surely Come)."" He could be playful, as he was in ""Ophelia"" and ""The Weight,"" where in the latter he lunges into the ""Take a load off, Fanny"" chorus with joyful abandon. And he could belt in sheer pleasure, galloping through ""The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show"" or simply lending his unique harmonies to ""The Shape I'm In"" and ""This Wheel's on Fire."" It was an American voice. Helm had been suffering from throat cancer. Despite reducing his voice to a rasp in recent years, it had not robbed him of his spirit. At his home in Woodstock, New York, he regularly hosted the Midnight Ramble, weekly concerts that attracted sell-out crowds and all-star support from the likes of Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson and Steely Dan's Donald Fagen. In the past decade, he recorded two albums, 2007's ""Dirt Farmer"" and 2009's ""Electric Dirt,"" that won Grammys. And he occasionally took the show on the road, making appearances at Tennessee's Bonnaroo, the Newport Folk Festival and Los Angeles' Greek Theater. Music, TV industries mourn Dick Clark . But Helm is best known for providing the vocals to such rock 'n' roll standards as ""The Weight"" and ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"" the latter a tale of a Confederate veteran sizing up his wasted land. That song was credited to The Band's primary songwriter, Robbie Robertson, who has said he was inspired by tales of the South from Helm and others. Certainly, there was never a doubt who would sing it: the Arkansas-born, Southern-mythologizing Helm. ""I aimed it right at him, I wrote it for him, he gets to say it all,"" Robertson told Rolling Stone in 1969. Levon Helm was born Mark Lavon Helm in Elaine, Arkansas, on May 26, 1940, the son of a cotton farmer. He told CNN that he was inspired by ""the old traveling medicine tent shows"" that would make the rounds in the South. ""They had comedians and wine and music. Always a lot of music,"" he said in 2010. After high school, he joined Ronnie Hawkins' band, the Hawks. When the Hawks moved to Canada in the early '60s, Hawkins and Helm recruited several local musicians, including Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and finally Garth Hudson. Hawkins left the band in 1963, and the group renamed itself Levon and the Hawks. The next year the group met Bob Dylan, beginning one of rock's great partnerships. The group, already known for its blazing live performances, ended up accompanying Dylan on his famous 1965-66 tours -- though Helm left by the end of 1965, upset at the vicious reaction the newly electric Dylan was getting from audiences. Helm rejoined the Hawks in 1967, playing on what became known as Dylan's ""Basement Tapes."" The group also wrote and recorded its own songs in the same place, a house called ""Big Pink"" in West Saugerties, New York. Renamed The Band, the group put out its debut album, ""Music from Big Pink,"" in 1968, to rapturous reviews. ""Six months are left in this proselytizing year of music ... but I have chosen my album for 1968. 'Music from Big Pink' is an event and should be treated as one,"" wrote Al Kooper in his Rolling Stone review of the LP. The music was something new in American rock: both ancient and modern, rooted in the past and eschewing the psychedelic sounds then in vogue. The group, too, looked like something just emerged from a 19th century daguerreotype. And Dylan did the cover and wrote or co-wrote three of the songs. The next album, 1969's ""The Band,"" earned them the January 12, 1970, cover of Time magazine, headlined ""The New Sound of Country Rock."" The magazine's artwork featured a menacing-looking Helm, bearded and hatted, looking every bit the American prophet he sometimes sounded. The group was, and remains, hugely influential; the whole alt-country movement can trace at least some of its roots to The Band. (Patterson Hood, the leader of the Drive-By Truckers, named one of his earlier groups ""Virgil Kane"" after the protagonist of ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."") Elton John and Bernie Taupin were huge fans, and their song ""Levon"" drew its character's name from Helm. The Band put out several more albums, including ""Stage Fright,"" ""Cahoots"" and ""Moondog Matinee,"" but touring and internal dissension took their toll. In 1976, the group decided to bow out with an all-star concert, ""The Last Waltz,"" filmed by Martin Scorsese and considered one of the great music concert documentaries. The tensions of the band were obvious on screen, and Helm in particular didn't hide his anger. In his 1993 autobiography, he talked about his disgust, as Greg Kot observed in a 2002 article on the film's anniversary. ""As far as I was concerned, the movie was a disaster,"" Helm wrote in the book, ""This Wheel's on Fire."" He also disputed some of Robertson's songwriting credits, though Robertson questioned Helm's version. ""Who did the work? I tried, I begged Levon to write songs or help me write songs -- all the guys. I always encouraged everybody to write,"" he told Kot. ""You can't make somebody do what they don't want to do or can't do, and he's not a songwriter."" Robertson, in a statement sent to CNN Wednesday, said he was ""shocked and so saddened to hear that my old band mate, Levon, was in the final stages of his battle with cancer. It hit me really hard because I thought he had beaten throat cancer and had no idea that he was this ill. ""Levon is one of the most extraordinary talented people I've ever known and very much like an older brother to me. I am so grateful I got to see him one last time and will miss him and love him forever,"" Robertson said. After the Band's split, Helm recorded a handful of solo albums and toured with his old bandmates, minus Robertson. There were losses there, too: Manuel committed suicide in 1986, and Danko passed away in 1999. Helm occasionally played with other groups, notably Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band. He also appeared in several movies, the best remembered of which is ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" which won Sissy Spacek an Oscar for her portrayal of country star Loretta Lynn. Helm had some hard times in the late '90s. His studio was hit with a fire. The throat cancer took his voice and medical bills threatened his house. He nearly declared bankruptcy. ""You got to pick one -- pay your medical bills or pay the mortgage. Most people can't do both, and I'm not different,"" he told CNN. But the Ramble, intended as a one-off ""rent party,"" according to Helm, helped raise money and revived his career. ""If I had my way about it, we'd probably do it every night,"" he said. ""I never get tired of it."" Indeed, it seemed there was nothing he enjoyed more than playing music for a few friends. In 2008, Helm received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award with The Band. He wasn't present to receive it. He held a Midnight Ramble in Woodstock instead.

"(Mental Floss) -- Until two centuries ago, ice was just an unfortunate side effect of winter. But in the early 1800s, one man saw dollar signs in frozen ponds. The ice industry pulls in $2.5 billion a year, but it's nowhere near as dominant as it used to be. Frederic Tudor not only introduced the world to cold glasses of water on hot summer days, he created a thirst people never realized they had. In 1805, two wealthy brothers from Boston, Massachusetts, were at a family picnic, enjoying the rare luxuries of cold beverages and ice cream. They joked about how their chilled refreshments would be the envy of all the colonists sweating in the West Indies. It was a passing remark, but it stuck with one of the brothers. His name was Frederic Tudor, and 30 years later, he would ship nearly 200 tons of ice halfway around the globe to become the ""Ice King."" Ice man cometh . Nothing in Tudor's early years indicated that he would invent an industry. He had the pedigree to attend Harvard but dropped out of school at the age of 13. After loafing for a few years, he retired to his family's country estate to hunt, fish, and play at farming. When his brother, William, quipped that they should harvest ice from the estate's pond and sell it in the West Indies, Frederic took the notion seriously. After all, he had little else to do. Frederic convinced William to join him in a scheme to ship ice from New England to the Caribbean. Tudor reasoned that once people tried it, they'd never want to live without it. During the next six months, the brothers pooled their money and laid out plans to ship their product to the French island of Martinique, where they hoped to create a monopoly on ice. No one believed the idea would work. In fact, no ship in Boston would agree to transport the unusual cargo, so Frederic spent nearly $5,000 (a big chunk of the seed money) buying a ship of his own. On February 10, 1806, The Boston Gazette reported, ""No joke. A vessel with a cargo of 80 tons of ice has cleared out from this port for Martinique. We hope this will not prove to be a slippery speculation."" It did. Although the ice arrived in Martinique in perfect condition, no one wanted to buy it. Tudor desperately explained how the cold blocks of ice could be used in the stifling Caribbean heat, but islanders weren't convinced. After an inauspicious start, William pulled out of the partnership. The following winter, Frederic was on his own. Remarkably, he drummed up enough money to send another shipment of ice to the Indies. But when a trade embargo left much of the Caribbean off limits for two years, Frederic was left twiddling his thumbs. Meanwhile, the Tudor family fortune had dwindled in a shady real estate deal in South Boston. Despite financial woes, Frederic persisted, and his ice business finally turned a profit in 1810. But a series of circumstances -- including war, weather, and relatives needing bailouts -- kept him from staying in the black for too long. Between 1809 and 1813, he landed in debtors' prison three times and spent the rest of the time hiding from the sheriff. Mental Floss: Coldest places on Earth . Breaking the ice . Perhaps it was his Yankee entrepreneurial spirit, or perhaps monomania, but Tudor was obsessed with the idea that ice would make him rich. During the next decade, he developed clever new techniques to convince people that they actually needed ice, including a ""first one's free"" pitch. While living in a South Carolina boarding house in 1819, Tudor made a habit of bringing a cooler of chilled beverages to the dinner table. His fellow boarders always scoffed at the sight, but after a sip or two, they'd inevitably fall in love with his ice. Tudor traveled around the country and convinced barkeeps to offer chilled drinks at the same price as regular drinks -- to see which would become more popular. He also taught restaurants how to make ice cream, and reached out to doctors and hospitals to convince them that ice was the perfect way to cool feverish patients. The truth is that people never knew they needed ice until Tudor made them try it. Once they did, they couldn't live without it. By 1821, Tudor's business was strengthening. He'd created real demand for his product in Savannah, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; New Orleans, Louisiana; and even Havana, Cuba. But he still needed to refine his operation. Enter Nathaniel Wyeth, an innovator who became Tudor's foreman in 1826. By using a horse-drawn plow to cut the ice into large grids, Wyeth invented a much faster harvesting method. He also put an assembly process into place. Laborers sawed the blocks apart and plunked them into canals to float them downstream. Then a conveyor belt would hoist the blocks from the water and carry them up to icehouses, where they'd be stacked up to 80 feet high. Still, only one-tenth of the ice harvested made it to sale. What's worse, the whole operation was incredibly unsafe. In addition to those towering stacks of ice, numb hands, sharp instruments, and frigid waters made the process dangerous. The 300-lb. blocks of ice could slide easily, knocking down men and breaking their limbs. Ice harvesters often developed ""ice man's knees,"" which were bruised and bloody from days of shoving solid ice. Mental Floss: People whose jobs actually killed them . Despite these drawbacks, Wyeth's ingenious methods were a major improvement on prior harvesting practices. With the inventor by his side, Tudor asserted his long-fomenting monopoly and became known as the ""Ice King."" Tudor's reputation solidified in 1833 when he shipped 180 tons of ice halfway across the world to British colonists in Calcutta. The venture was so successful that it reopened trade routes between India and Boston. Back at home, Tudor continued to dominate the scene. By 1847, nearly 52,000 tons of ice traveled by ship or train to 28 cities across the United States. Nearly half the ice came from Boston, and most of that was Tudor's. He also maintained ice-harvesting rights to key ponds throughout Massachusetts. Even Henry David Thoreau watched Tudor's workers harvest Walden Pond and waxed philosophic about the scene in his diary: ""The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges."" The end of the Ice Age . Frederic Tudor died in 1864, finally rich again. By that time, everyone with access to a frozen body of water was in on the action. Ice boomtowns sprouted along the Kennebec River in Maine, where farmers found year-round employment. The 1860s became the peak competitive period of American ice harvesting, and Tudor's company prospered. Even during the Civil War, when the South was cut off from ice supplies in the North, the ice industry continued to grow in New England and in the Midwest. As American society grew more accustomed to fresh meats, milk, and fruit, the ice industry expanded into one of the most powerful industries in the nation. At the turn of the 20th century, nearly every family, grocer, and barkeep in America had an icebox. But ironically, America's dependence on ice created the very technology that would lead to the decline of the ice empire -- electric freezers and refrigerators. During the early 1900s, these appliances became more reliable, and by 1940, 5 million units had been sold. With freezers allowing people to make ice at home, there was little need to ship massive quantities across the country. Today, the ice industry pulls in $2.5 billion a year, but it's nowhere near as dominant as it used to be. Most of the business is from pre-packaged, direct-to-consumer ice (the stuff you buy for your beer cooler). Mental Floss: Blind genius invented cruise control . Still, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be grateful. The next time you put your lips to a slushie, or an iced tea, or a chilled martini, or a cold beer on a hot day, take a moment to thank the crazy Yankee who had the vision to turn water into money.

"(CNN) -- Modern medicine is remarkable, but only if you have access to it. In many countries, including the United States, people are suffering because they can't get the health care they need. Three everyday people are trying to help change that, though. Georges Bwelle, Richard Nares and Laura Stachel, three of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes, are medical marvels dedicated to improving other people's health. Here's how each of them, in his or her own way, is trying to save lives: . Georges Bwelle . The problem: In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people. And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it. Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private. ""The only problem they have is poverty,"" Bwelle said. ""And with poverty, they ... cannot enjoy their life."" How Bwelle took action: Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it. He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital. And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care. Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care. Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford. In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia. Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person. ""We are receiving 500 people in each trip,"" Bwelle said. ""They are coming from 60 kilometers (37 miles) around the village, and they're coming on foot."" Richard Nares . The problem: For many children fighting cancer, it can be extremely tough to make it to their chemotherapy appointments. When Nares' 3-year-old son, Emilio, was being treated in 1998 for leukemia, Nares met many families who struggled: Single moms forced to take leave from jobs without pay, kids having to ride the bus alone to their chemotherapy appointments, siblings left home alone. Nares said it broke his heart. ""It's extremely tough, not just emotionally, but now financially,"" he said. ""Sometimes, both parents have to either leave their job or cut back severely. Some ... don't have (an) extra $10 to pay for cafeteria food."" How Nares took action: When Emilio died, his father decided he had watched too many people struggle. He went back to the hospital in San Diego where Emilio had received most of his treatment, and he asked how he could help. ""Transportation,"" they said. So Nares started picking up families in his old Buick. ""I was going every day, picking up families all over the county,"" he said. Soon, however, Nares couldn't handle the number of requests that were coming in. So he teamed up with nurses and social workers from the hospital to create a formal transportation program. He hired a driver, formalized a schedule for pickups and drop-offs and started the Emilio Nares Foundation in 2003. ""No child should miss their cancer treatment due to lack of transportation,"" Nares said. Laura Stachel . The problem: During a two-week trip to Nigeria in 2008, Stachel witnessed countless times when the lives of mothers and babies were at risk simply because of a lack of reliable electricity. Pregnant women would arrive at the hospital with severe complications, but without adequate light to treat them, procedures had to be compromised or delayed until daylight. Some women were even turned away. ""I realized that my skills as an obstetrician-gynecologist were utterly useless (without) something as basic as light and electricity,"" Stachel said. Stachel said midwives in Nigeria use all kinds of makeshift lighting when they deliver babies: kerosene lanterns, candles, even cell phones. ""That's not adequate light for maternity care,"" she said. How Stachel took action: With the help of Hal Aronson, her husband and a solar energy educator, Stachel developed a special solar energy kit that can easily provide much-needed light and power for medical equipment. Since 2009, the kits have been helping healthcare workers save lives not only in Nigeria but in facilities throughout Africa, Asia and Central America. ""I really want a world where women can deliver babies safely and with dignity,"" Stachel said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The family of Bryan Stow, the San Francisco Giants fan who was severely beaten at Dodger Stadium, filed a civil lawsuit Tuesday claiming faulty security measures and defective facilities contributed to his attack, court officials said. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, names the Los Angeles Dodgers Corporation and its owner, Frank McCourt, as defendants. The suit lists Stow's parents, Elizabeth Ann Stow and David Edward Stow, as plaintiffs on behalf of his two minor children, Tyler and Tabitha Stow, according to court spokeswoman Elizabeth Diaz. ""It is unfortunate that such a storied and well respected baseball club such as the Los Angeles Dodgers has been made to suffer due to the cutbacks and mismanagement by its owner Frank McCourt and his various corporate entities,"" the lawsuit says. The complaint alleges that cutbacks led to a major downsizing of security as a cost-saving measure due to McCourt's personal family problems and to"" fund his lavish lifestyle."" McCourt and his wife, Jamie, are in the middle of a contentious divorce proceeding. His divorce attorney, Steve Susman, declined to comment on the suit. Stow, 42, was attacked in the stadium parking lot following the first game of the Dodgers' and Giants' seasons on March 31. Stow, a paramedic by training, had gone to the game with friends in celebration of the Giants' World Series victory last season. The lawsuit alleges that security officers and managers at Dodger Stadium were apprised of a history of aggressive violent behavior and criminal gang activity in some crowds at the stadium, and neglected to provide reasonable safety mechanisms to protect Stow, including the failure to hire a security chief for six weeks prior to opening day. A ""half-off"" alcohol promotion for all day games also was cited in the suit as a contributing factor in the disorderly conduct and violent aggressive behavior. According to the suit, prior incidents of violence should have resulted in the hiring and presence of more uniformed police officers instead of security personnel dressed in trousers and polo shirts. The suit cites a parking-lot incident at the stadium on September 19, 2003, in which a Giants fan was shot and killed by a reputed Dodgers fan. A then-20-year-old California man was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison in that case, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's website. In 2009, a man was attacked on opening day as the Dodgers hosted the Giants, according to the lawsuit. ""The decision not to place uniformed (Los Angeles police) officers created a relaxed, intimidating atmosphere at Dodger Stadium,"" the suit says. Before the attack, Stow had texted a family member fearing for his safety inside the stadium as fans repeatedly taunted and yelled profanities at him, according to Stow's relatives. Several fans threw hot dogs, peanuts and trash at Stow and his companions, the suit alleges. ""Dodgers personnel walked up and down the aisle directly adjacent to where Stow and his friends were seated. Ushers were present and actively viewed aggressive behavior towards Stow, but failed to take any preventative measures,"" the suit says. The suit claims that Stow was subjected to harassment, threats and intimidation even as he left the stadium and entered the parking lot area and that security personnel, knowing those dangers, failed to diffuse the escalation of violent behavior or intervene and ensure his safety in a reasonable manner. The suit also claims that security officers allowed Stow's alleged attackers to follow him out of the stadium and into the parking lot taxi loading zone where the beating occurred. In the lot, two men confronted Stow and -- unprovoked -- began kicking and punching him while yelling profanities about the Giants, police said. The suit also alleges that the security response time was inadequate, in part, because of poor lighting in the lot. It took 10 to 15 minutes after the attack for personnel to reach Stow. ""Dodger Stadium is the third oldest stadium in baseball. Without the implementation of adequate security measures by the Dodgers defendants, along with inadequate lighting fixtures that have been in existence since the opening of Dodgers Stadium in 1962, Stow was inappropriately exposed to the aggressive acts of third parties,"" according to the suit. Citing club policy, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Dodgers declined to comment on the lawsuit. On Sunday, Los Angeles authorities announced the arrest of a man that police described as the ""primary aggressor"" in the attack. Police said Giovanni Ramirez, 31, was jailed on $1 million bail, and the investigation was continuing. Police said later that Ramirez is a parolee and documented gang member associated with the Varrio Nuevo Estrada street gang in East Los Angeles. In 1998, Ramirez was convicted of robbery and possession of a firearm in 2005, court records show. Stow's mother, Ann Stow, said recently that her son was first hit from behind, at which point he fell and his head hit the concrete. ""It was just a brutal attack,"" she said. ""Whatever that guy hit my son with, Bryan was unconscious before he hit the ground, so he had no way to protect his head. Stow was taken out of a medically induced coma over a week ago, and has since shown signs of some cognitive function, Los Angeles neurosurgeon Dr. Gabriel Zada said. He was transferred last week from Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center to San Francisco General and Trauma Center, bringing him closer to his home, Zada said. Authorities are searching for at least two other suspects in the beating. The attackers fled in a white four door late model Mitsubishi or Acura vehicle with tan interior, police said.","NEW: A lawsuit cites alleged security cutbacks and lapses at Dodger Stadium .

"(CNN) -- Ethiopia's hopes of making an unlikely appearance in the 2014 World Cup Finals suffered a major setback Sunday as a double from Emmanuel Emenike gave Nigeria a precious away victory in the first leg of their final African qualifier. Ethiopia have been the surprise team in the 10 remaining African national sides bidding for five places in Brazil and dominated against their more illustrious opponents for over an hour in Addis Ababa. But they let the Super Eagles off the hook through poor finishing, with Girma Adane wasting the best chance in the first half. After the break the pattern continued but in the 56th minute they did go ahead in unusual circumstances as Behailu Assefa's cross was caught by Vincent Enyeama, but the referee ruled it had crossed the line. But the Antelopes were unable to take advantage of their good fortune as Nigeria came more into the match. Victor Moses might have leveled after being put clean through but they were on level terms after Emenike's shot found its way past Jemal Tassew. In the final minute the home despair was complete as Aynalem Hailu gave away a penalty for a foul and Emenike converted from the spot. Nigeria will need just a home draw in the return leg in Calabar to book their place in Brazil next month. Cameroon are also well placed to join them, holding Tunisia to a goalless draw in the other key qualifier Sunday. They were indebted to goalkeeper Charles Itandj, who was kept busy and kept out good opportunities either side of the break. But Cameroon, with Samuel Eto'o starting after his brief international retirement, also had chances and Pierre Webo may rue his miss from only a few yards out which would have given them a cushion ahead of the return in Yaounde.","Nigeria take 2-1 lead over Nigeria in World Cup playoff qualifier .

"Editor's note: Thomas Levenson is a professor at MIT, where he heads the Graduate Program in Science Writing. He is the author of a new book, ""Newton and the Counterfeiter"" and an award-winning filmmaker, with 10 documentaries on science broadcast on PBS. Thomas Levenson says Isaac Newton's bad gamble shows financial regulation has always been needed. (CNN) -- From winter to spring 1720, London, England, was delirious, entranced, rolling in money. It seemed as if riches were so easily gained that only fools would not buy into that brand new engine of wealth, the stock exchange, and especially into shares of the enterprise leading the boom, a banking concern called the South Sea Company. As spring turned into summer, no one, it seemed, could deny the obvious, not even the most rational of men. So, in June and again in July, Sir Isaac Newton -- the inventor of calculus (the branch of mathematics that describes change over time, which is to say, an awful lot of what matters in both science and life); the man who framed the laws of motion and set physics on its modern trajectory; a pioneering chemist, an inventor (virtually all present-day telescopes derive from his design), a religious historian -- and even a financial thinker -- put a sizable chunk of his personal fortune into shares of the South Sea Company. The bubble burst that September. Newton lost 90 percent of his stake -- a substantial fraction of his total worth. In that loss can be found the key to the debate we are having right now in the wake of the Obama administration's move to re-regulate American financial markets. Arguments over the supervision of financial transactions occur in the wake of every bubble. Opponents of such regulation always return to the same simple claim. They say that investors are grown-ups, capable of making the best assessments of their own interests and acting accordingly. Markets are thus no more than self-correcting mechanisms for connecting such rational actors, and any attempt to impose rules on their interaction will only render them less efficient. Those in favor say that all this is nonsense, that in the real world, markets are not populated by equally well-informed people analyzing their own circumstances and acting accordingly -- and that every financial collapse thus takes down both those who should have known better and those who couldn't have hoped to. Hence, they say, an active enforcer needs to provide a level playing field and to deter actual fraud. Painfully recent experience suggests that's true enough -- but Newton's case suggests a deeper necessity at the heart of the case for proactive regulation. What happened to him, or rather, how he acted, reveals a fundamental truth of economic and emotional life: At the point of crisis, when clear thought and a cool head matter most, no one is in fact a rational actor -- not even the greatest scientific mind of his or any other age. So what brought Newton low? Desire, perhaps envy, or, in other words, human nature. Newton had been an active trader in the new stock market for years before the bubble year of 1720. He made his first investment in the South Sea issue early, in 1713, and held it for several years, marking a modest paper profit. He held on through early 1720, as the company pursued a new and increasingly risky banking deal -- and as insiders began to talk up the (as it turned out, fictitious) trading profits the company expected from another venture. That got the desired result, a sudden leap in stock prices. Starting at £128 in January, the price for South Sea securities rose to £175 in February and then £330 in March. Newton kept his head -- at first. He sold in April, content with his (quite spectacular) gains to date. But then, between April and June, share prices tripled, reaching over £1,000 ... which is precisely when he could stand it no longer. Having ""lost"" two thirds of his potential gain, Newton bought again at the very top, and bought more after a slight decline in July. If that sounds familiar, it should, at least to buyers of Webvan in 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst -- or, for that matter, to those who picked up Lehman Brothers shares in winter 2008. The South Sea stock price held up through August 1720, and then in September, the gap between the possible income from all the purchased debt and the returns promised to investors became too obvious to ignore. The bubble burst, and South Sea share prices collapsed to roughly their pre-bubble level. Newton's losses totaled as much as £20,000, between $4 million and $5 million in 21st century terms. The catastrophe did not sink him; he had made other, more cautious investments, including a significant stake in the East India Company, and when he died in 1727, his estate was valued at £30,000 pounds. But it was a terrific blow, even so. Here's why this story matters now. Of all people, Newton should have known better. He had, after all, invented the mathematics that could expose the impossibility of the South Sea Company's promise of returns to be paid to an everlasting stream of new investors. And yet, even he could not resist the prospect of infinite returns on his money. Hence, the obligation to regulate. There is plenty of recent academic research that confirms that bubbles -- including the ones we've just endured -- are not unique disasters, but the predictable consequences of human behavior in the context of implausible rewards. What Newton's experience tells us is that this has been true since the beginning of modern markets -- and that mere intelligence, even genius, doesn't help. Isaac Newton said so himself. After the disaster, he could not bear to hear the phrase ""South Sea"" mentioned in his presence. But just once he admitted that while he knew how to predict the motions of the cosmos, ""he could not calculate the madness of the people."" We still can't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Levenson.","Thomas Levenson: Isaac Newton was a mathematical, scientific genius .

"(CNN) -- Rapiro is a humanoid robot that can be programmed to do various tasks â€” including make you coffee. The kit was created by a Japanese company as a ""catalyst between robotics and Raspberry Pi."" The credit-card sized, Linux-based PC known as Raspberry Pi is designed to work with the basic hardware of Rapiro, allowing you to program it to do many things, such as manage your calendar or tell you the weather, in addition to making the coffee. Rapiro isn't the first of its kind: BrickPi is a Raspberry Pi-controlled lego robot that was funded through Kickstarter. According to its developers, BrickPi ""connects LEGO Mindstorms Sensors, motors, and parts to turn your credit card-size computer into a robot."" Unlike Rapiro, it functions more as a toy than a personal assistant. Raspberry Pi makes the software easily customizable for users who are familiar with the technology. Rapiro can also be fitted with a camera to give it the ability to gather and store visual data. (Also a feature of Raspberry Pi.) Rapiro also has 12 ""servo motors,"" which help it with mobility. If you're not Raspberry Pi-savvy or just dabbling in robotics, that's fine too. According to the website, the idea of the project is for a beginner to get into robotics and for an expert to create higher utility through Raspberry Pi.

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts wildlife officials shot and killed an adolescent black bear that climbed a tree in a Boston suburb Sunday after attempts to tranquilize the animal failed, state officials said. The state Environmental Police agency said it killed the 100-plus-pound animal ""in the interest of public safety"" and gave the remains to a local sports club ""to salvage the meat for use by its members."" The animal had been spotted on a railroad track early Sunday in the Boston suburb of Newton. State police briefly closed the nearby Massachusetts Turnpike while authorities tried to remove the bear, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. In a statement posted on its Facebook page early Sunday, the Newton Police Department urged people to keep away from the area: ""We don't want him to get scared and fall onto the train tracks,"" it said. Later, via Twitter, Newton police said the bear was killed after several unsuccessful attempts to tranquilize it. The animal was a male, about a year old, and weighed between 100 and 125 pounds, the Environmental Police said. State wildlife officials had tagged it in February. About 3,000 black bears are believed to live in Massachusetts. They have been ""known to co-exist with people"" in the suburbs, the Environmental Police said in a statement. ""The black bear population has been slowly growing and expanding its range into eastern and southeastern Massachusetts. As the bear population expands and moves eastward, more black bears will be seen in eastern Massachusetts,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- When Nelson Mandela was released from prison in February 1990, where he'd spent more than 27 years for fighting racial segregation, the South African leader knew exactly who he wanted to become his official photographer: Peter Magubane. ""I became his photographer the next day he got home,"" remembers award-winning Magubane. ""He told the ANC [African National Congress] guys, 'this is the guy I want' -- I was the happiest man."" Mandela's choice wasn't a surprise; Magubane, who had already photographed several milestones in Mandela's life, including his early days as a political activist in the 1950s, was renowned for his impressive body of work chronicling the cruelties of apartheid. Read this - War reporter: 'My camera is my weapon' And, like Mandela, Magubane had also faced the wrath of South Africa's oppressive regime. In 1969, Magubane was detained and kept in solitary confinement for 586 consecutive days. Later on, he was banned from working as a photographer for five years and sent to prison again for breaking the banning orders. ""I told myself, there is no one that is going to tell me what to do,"" says Magubane. ""I had prepared to die for what I'm doing because I'm not stealing anything,"" he adds. ""I am prepared to face the guns. I'm prepared to face police, any gangster, whether black or white. I'm not going to be told not to do my work."" Watch this: South Africa's 'Bang-Bang Club' Magubane's long and acclaimed career started some six decades ago at the legendary Drum magazine, a Johannesburg publication that became a platform for talented writers and photographers, depicting a vibrant black urban culture in white-dominated South Africa. Magubane started as a driver but was eventually promoted to the dark room and then the field. With his camera on hand, he went on to snap some of the most defining images of the anti-apartheid struggle -- from the treason trials in the 1950s to the youth uprising in Soweto in 1976. Undeterred by threats, bans and prison, Magubane's defiant spirit shaped his work in the field. His refusal to put down his camera meant that he'd often have to get creative to bamboozle authorities. ""I'd buy half a loaf of bread, cut the inside of the bread, and put the camera in there,"" Magubane says. ""I'd go around taking pictures."" And if a policeman appeared ... ""I'm eating bread."" Read this: Why mixed-race comic was 'born a crime' The committed photographer, who also went on to work for the Rand Daily Mail and Time Magazine, has won several awards for his iconic images that resonate to this day. He has held exhibitions across the world, published 17 books and received seven honorary degrees. Today, at 81, he is still working hard -- although he has found a new focus for his lens. ""I'm sick and tired of taking pictures of dead people,"" says Magubane. His main interest now is shooting images displaying the culture, the people and the beauty of his country, including stunning photos of the setting sun. ""If I come across hell, hell will break loose, I will take pictures,"" he explains. ""I will stop and say 'no I'm not doing the sun.' But what I don't want to do is wait there the whole day waiting for police to shoot people,"" adds Magubane. ""During apartheid fighting for freedom, yes, I did that. I'm no longer fighting for freedom so I'm not going to do that."" Watch the video at the top of the story to see some of Peter Magubane's iconic photographs.

"(CNN) -- The leader of a shuttering Ohio coal mining operation on Friday blamed the Obama administration for the shutdown and for hurting the economy generally with he called a ""war on coal,"" an assertion the White House pushed back on as false and misleading. OhioAmerican Energy, which is a subsidiary of Murray Energy Corporation, issued a statement announcing its coal mining operations near Brilliant, in southeastern Ohio, would be closing five years earlier than expected. Its founder, Robert Murray, personally went to tell the operation's employees there that they were being laid off. The company said that the operation employed 239 people ""at its peak,"" though there were no firm numbers as to the number that lost their jobs Friday beyond that 32 would be reassigned to other positions. Company leaders -- who have been donors to Republicans -- claimed the ""regulatory actions by President Barack Obama and his appointees and followers (are) the entire reason"" for the closure. In fact, they predicted more layoffs to come unless there is a major shift in the political landscape. In Ohio, swing state politics have real-life impact . ""There will be additional layoffs, not only at Murray Energy, but also throughout the United States coal industry due to Mr. Obama's 'war on coal' and the destruction that it has caused so many jobs and families in the Ohio Valley area and elsewhere,"" Murray said. Yet White House spokesman Clark Stevens rebutted that view, pointing to ""flexibilities for clean coal standards over the last three years"" and the fact U.S. coal production is on the upswing. There were more U.S. coal miners working this year, for instance, than any year since 1997 and U.S. coal exports rose 31% over the previous year, he said. ""The president has made clear that coal has an important role in our energy economy today, and it will in the future,"" Stevens said. ""(That) is why the administration has worked to make sure that, moving forward, we can continue to rely on a broad range of domestic energy sources from oil to gas, to wind and solar, to nuclear, as well as clean coal."" Ohio is considered a key swing state in this fall's presidential election, in which Obama faces presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney. By the numbers: Why Ohio matters . Top Murray Energy officials had made their allegiances clear before the announcement: Murray, the corporation's CEO, is a major GOP donor having donated more than $150,000 to Republicans in 2012 alone, and Murray Energy's political action committee has similarly given Republicans upwards of $100,000 in the past year. Stanley Piasecki, the superintendent of the closing OhioAmerican Energy coal mine, claimed Thursday that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden both intend to ""destroy so many lives and family livelihoods in this area for no benefit whatsoever."" Yet Brandon Unklesbay, the manager of Southeastern Equipment in Brilliant, said he didn't believe the coal mining operations closure will negatively impact the area or its businesses. ""It's not going to hurt my business,"" Unklesbay said. David Celebrezze, director of Air and Water Special Projects with the environmental group the Ohio Environmental Council, said that he and his group favor clean energy measures and curing what he described as Ohio's addiction to coal. Many of the coal-related regulations being enforced now, he said, are ""not really new"" -- having been passed, in some form, in 1990 as part of the Clean Air Act. Rather than pay lobbyists to fight such rules or to inject themselves into the 2012 presidential race, Celebrezze said he'd prefer that utilities focus first on ""cleaning up their act"" so that residents can breathe, and live, better.

"(CNN) -- Canada officially renounced the expiring Kyoto Protocol on Monday, a day after international negotiators agreed to extend the treaty's limits on carbon emissions blamed for a warming climate. Environment Minister Peter Kent said Ottawa would keep working to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and help negotiate a new framework for a global pact. But in a statement to reporters on his return from last week's climate conference in South Africa, Kent said that for Canada, Kyoto ""is in the past."" Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government has long opposed the Kyoto protocol and has refused to implement it since taking office in 2006. Ahead of the decision, the opposition New Democratic Party accused his government of ""standing up for big polluters"" at the expense of ordinary Canadians and risking the country's reputation by abandoning the 1997 treaty. Kent said Kyoto's goals were unworkable because the United States and China -- the world's two largest sources of carbon emissions -- never agreed to Kyoto, and that a new pact is needed to address emissions from rapidly growing economies including those of China, Brazil and India. Special: The Road to Durban . The government announced in 2010 that it would fall well short of the treaty's target of a 6% cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2012. Kent said the previous government signed onto the treaty ""without any regard to how it would be fulfilled,"" and that Canadians faced ""radical"" cuts or financial penalties equivalent to $1,600 per family as a result. He said Canada was ""well on our way"" to reducing emissions by 17% over 2005 levels by 2020, but critics say that self-imposed goal is well below the Kyoto targets. Nations in the Durban talks agreed to extend Kyoto's efforts over the weekend and launched an effort to set up a broader pact with a legal format to curb carbon emissions. The talks also launched a Green Climate Fund, which would essentially channel about $100 billion by 2020 to vulnerable countries to help them deal with the effects of climate change.","Environment minister says Canada will still work to reduce greenhouse emissions .

"(Rolling Stone) -- A bronze sculpture of Willie Nelson will be erected later this month in Austin, Texas. The statue, a gift to the city from the non-profit group Capital Area Statues, Inc., will be unveiled at 4:20 p.m. on April 20 as a nod to the country star's reputation as a stoner. The eight-foot tall, one-ton bronze statue was created by sculptor Clete Shields. ""Creating a sculpture of such an icon while he is still living presents its challenges,"" Shields said in a statement. ""For many, the Willie they connect with is the Outlaw Willie of the Seventies, or the influential advocate for Farm Aid in the Eighties, while others -- especially a younger generation -- grew fond of him during his more mature years. The sculpture needed to appeal to a broad audience and conjure up the fond memories of so many different people."" The unveiling event will include an appearance by Nelson himself, who will be in town to perform at ACL Live at the Moody Theatre as part of the We Walk the Line show celebrating the music of Johnny Cash.

"HELSTON, England (CNN)  -- A huge cyclone struck Myanmar in May 2008. It was the largest recorded disaster in that country, killing more than 130,000 people and leaving millions homeless. Since 2001, Tom Henderson's organization, ShelterBox, has supplied aid to more than 600,000 people. ""We were one of the first aid agencies into the country, delivering our ShelterBoxes,"" says Tom Henderson, whose relief package and organization of the same name has aided more than 600,000 victims of disasters of all scales worldwide since 2001. Designed to help an extended family survive for a minimum of six months, the lightweight, weatherproof box contains items such as a 10-person tent, blankets, basic tools, water-purification tablets and containers, a multi-fuel or wood-burning stove, mosquito nets and other items tailored to the particular region in crisis. The ""ShelterBox is designed to be small enough so two people can carry it -- but it has to be large enough to get equipment in for 10 people,"" Henderson explains. ""It's a simple package of aid delivered to the most needy people in the shortest amount of time."" The ex-Royal Navy search-and-rescue diver says the idea behind the ShelterBox came to him ""literally in a heartbeat"" while watching the news in 1999. Henderson was struck by the footage he saw of relief workers dropping food on the ground to victims of a disaster. ""I decided there and then that I would try to make a difference in a more sensible and dignified way,"" he recalls. ""I went to my study and I got a piece of paper out, and I wrote down 'shelter,' 'warm,' 'comfort,' and 'dignity.' And that's where it started."" Though Henderson says people thought he was crazy, he searched around the world for the products he knew would work. In 2000, he brought his idea to the local Helston-Lizard Rotary Club, where members adopted the cause. In January 2001, the first 143 ShelterBoxes were flown to earthquake-ravaged Gujarat, India. Since then, the ShelterBox organization has responded to more than 70 disasters in 46 countries. ""If people have lost everything why should they lose their dignity as well?"" asks Henderson. ""So we were very keen, as well as delivering aid, to give people back their dignity, put them back in control.""  Watch how ShelterBox helps victims of disasters around the world » . The secret of its success is two-fold, explains Henderson. ShelterBox is nonpolitical, accepting no funding from government agencies, and is a worldwide network with communication hubs near every potential disaster site via Rotary International. This allows ShelterBox to respond within 72 hours of a disaster anywhere in the world, subject to customs and local political barriers. According to ShelterBox, each box costs £490 in the United Kingdom and $1,000 in the United States, including all materials, packing, storage and distribution to recipients around the world. Donations from the British public and money raised from Rotary Clubs worldwide help fund the boxes. Watch Henderson reveal the items in a typical ShelterBox » . ""Nobody can buy our boxes, they are only available for free,"" says Henderson. Although Henderson does not travel to drop off boxes or choose where they go, he says he remains motivated by the thought of the millions of people that need help every day, and that if ShelterBox stops delivering aid, people might not survive. Watch Henderson tell the story of a mother and her baby in a ShelterBox » . ""The goal for me was these people,"" he says. ""I had pictures in my mind's eye... [like] children dying in the snow after a disaster. We want this to last for years to come, not just to get them through this disaster, [but] as a springboard for moving forward."" Stories that Henderson hears from the field remind him that ShelterBox is doing just that. Recently, a woman in Kenya gave birth to a baby girl in a ShelterBox tent. ""The ShelterBox became a crib for the baby. And the blankets became blankets for the baby,"" says Henderson. ""It's a huge feeling of pride and satisfaction when these sorts of things happen.""","Tom Henderson's organization, ShelterBox, helps disaster victims worldwide .

"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The soldiers had barely arrived in Iraq before they got new orders -- get ready for Afghanistan. A soldier waits in Baghdad for a flight to his new mission in Kandahar. The 4th Engineer Battalion out of Colorado Springs, Colorado, deployed to Camp Victory near Baghdad in mid-February. Two weeks after the unit began actually going out on operations in Iraq, it was ordered to redeploy to Kandahar in Afghanistan. The soldiers hadn't even finished painting their emblem outside their tactical operations command when the move began. But even as he walked through the stripped-down post, battalion commander Lt. Col. Kevin Landers could not hold back his excitement. ""The president has asked our military and our country to shift the focus and bolster the effort in Afghanistan, and we are really spearheading some of that effort, so of course there is some excitement here,"" he said outside a building being cleared out. The move put a strain on this battalion, which specializes in route clearance, or finding and destroying land mines and bombs on roads to make them safe for travel.  Watch soldiers leave Iraq, arrive in Afghanistan » . ""Yes, it is hard work,"" said Pfc. Kimble Han, sweat pouring down his face as he pulled out a sandbag foundation for a tent he and colleagues had put out only weeks before. ""But I believe we have trained well and are prepared for the new mission in Afghanistan."" The battlefield in Afghanistan is very different than Iraq. ""In Iraq you are looking at more close-quarters combat in an urban environment, but in Afghanistan the area is only sparsely populated and we are looking at much more of a linear battlefield,"" said Lt. Matthew Fitzgibbon. That means the soldiers will probably be engaged in longer distance firefights while on their patrols and their training in Baghdad before the deployment mirrored that. The troops spent extra hours on the shooting range, recalibrating their weapons and testing different optics. ""No matter who the enemy is, we will bring a bigger fight,"" one soldier said loading his weapon. As the United States shifts its focus from Iraq to Afghanistan, the military has deemed route clearance so important to the operations in the Kandahar area that it is airlifting the entire battalion to the new battlefield. The move poses huge logistical challenges to the Army and especially the Air Force. Between 50 and 70 gigantic C-17 cargo planes are necessary to transport dozens of heavy armored mine-resistant vehicles, containers and pallets -- all this as the Air Force's capabilities are strained due to regular combat operations. Many flights are delayed, canceled, rescheduled and then canceled again. Lt. William Hutaff, one of the first soldiers to leave for Afghanistan as part of an advance party, had his flight delayed several times and waited almost two days before he could board one of the cargo planes. ""Yeah, there's been a lot of waiting,"" he said from a seat in the hull of the plane, facing his mine-resistant vehicle that was shipping out too. ""We are glad we are finally going and we hope someone will be there to pick us up."" None of the soldiers with whom CNN traveled to Afghanistan knew what to expect when they hit the ground in Kandahar. The bases in Iraq have been developed over the past six years since the United States led the invasion and offer amenities from shopping facilities to coffee shops. In Iraq, the soldiers stayed in solid trailers. In Afghanistan, they would be living in tents. But none of that seemed on the soldiers' minds as the plane took off from Baghdad International Airport for the four-hour flight to Afghanistan, and many of them went to sleep shortly after takeoff or listened to music on their iPods in the dark and loud hull of the giant plane. The terrain the jet was flying over changed from the Iraqi desert to the more rugged hills of southern Afghanistan before the crew of the C-17 crew performed a combat landing into Kandahar International Airport. Leaving the aircraft, the soldiers said they were tired and looking to get into their new housing units. ""We want to get our vehicle unloaded and then get settled in,"" Hutaff said. Getting settled in meant sleeping in cots in a tent designed to house more than 100 people, but the base itself proved more developed than many had thought, with a basketball court and even an hockey rink built by the Canadian contingent stationed there. But the compound assigned to the battalion proved to be a lot worse for wear than the troops expected. Years ago it had been home to Polish troops, but now the buildings were withering away in the sun. The engineers spent their first days tearing down some structures with bulldozers and ripping the interiors out of others. ""There is still a lot of work to be done here,"" said Fitzgibbon. ""right now our motor pool, the place we're supposed to park our vehicles, is a lake.""","Troops hadn't even finished painting their emblem when they got orders to move .

"(CNN) -- Gasps punctured the air inside Boston Symphony Hall after the conductor interrupted the afternoon performance to announce to the 2,500 people in the audience that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Listening to the moment, which was captured on an audio recording, the emotions are still powerful 50 years later. The weekly Friday concert had started at 2 p.m. ""just like normal,"" recalled Joseph Silverstein, then a 29-year-old violinist in his first year as the concertmaster for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. No one in the concert hall knew that, as they took their seats for the performance, their president had been fatally shot in Dallas. Thirty minutes in, the orchestra broke for a 15-minute intermission. And that, Silverstein recalled, is when this very normal day was shattered. During the intermission, Silverstein remembers huddling around the 24-inch TV in the basement, watching in horror along with 100 other musicians as Walter Cronkite delivered the news of the assassination. There was no time to react. ""I was just trying to grasp the reality of it,"" Silverstein said, adding that he has never publicly shared his memories from that terrible day until now. ""We were stunned."" The orchestra had to go upstairs to an audience that remained blissfully unaware of the events in Dallas. As the group walked to the concert hall, several orchestra members openly wept, but Silverstein says they still managed to take their seats. The orchestra's music director, Erich Leinsdorf, was going to have to break the news to the audience. Silverstein says the legendary music director was nervous, but his Austrian-tinged English was slow and deliberate while making the announcement, as if delivering the 46 words was just as painful as the initial shock of the president's death. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have a press report over the wires. We hope that it is unconfirmed, but we have to doubt it,"" Leinsdorf told the audience. ""The president of the United States has been the victim of an assassination."" A rush of gasps and screams filled the cavernous hall. Leinsdorf continued, ""We will play the funeral march from Beethoven's Third Symphony."" A second swell of gasps as the audience grappled with the news and the announcement that the music would go on. Seated at the end of a row, closest to the audience, Silverstein watched the stunned people react to the news. Some left the hall, but the majority remained. The audience came to their feet, standing for the entire funeral march, rising to honor the memory of their slain leader. The funeral march lasted for 12 minutes, what seemed like an eternity to Silverstein. The orchestra's president of trustees at the time, Henry B. Cabot, a member of Boston's noted Cabot family, walked to the stage. Cabot, who regularly attended the Friday afternoon concerts, told the audience a story about the death of his father, according to Silverstein saying that he had ""needed to hear music to help through the tragedy"" because of the ""solace"" music provides. Playing his violin for the remainder of the program, 30 minutes of a very surreal experience, Silverstein could barely concentrate on the music. He remembers gazing out into the audience and looking into the eyes of others in the orchestra, disbelief registering on their faces. Once the program was over, the remaining audience members stood and filed solemnly out of the hall. Not one person applauded. Silverstein himself went home to his mourning family in nearby Brookline. He remembers this event as the first of many blows to the country, as it was followed by the assassinations of Malcolm X, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. The shooting of the president was the ""first time anyone of us had been confronted with the situation,"" he said. It was the day peace was shattered.","This week marks 50 years since JFK was assassinated .

"Washington (CNN) -- While 39 House Democrats voted with Republicans on a proposed fix to canceled insurance policies under Obamacare on Friday, sources on both sides said more would have defected without President Barack Obama's mea culpa over the mess. As it is, the vote is an embarrassment for the President, but it could have been worse. Another 18 defectors could have given Republicans a veto-proof majority and ammunition to really pressure the Democratic-controlled Senate to take up the measure. But senior Democratic aides said that might have been possible before Thursday. That's when Obama took action on his own, met with reporters to talk about it, and dispatched his Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, to Captiol Hill to meet with Democratic lawmakers. One senior Democratic House aide described the mood of the caucus between Wednesday and Thursday as ""night and day."" Other aides echoed that sentiment. In addition to announcing his plan to try to repair the damage done under Obamacare, the President's Q&A was as much about trying to provide political cover for Democrats in tough reelection bids next year. Some have been targeted by the Republican Party's campaign machine. Almost all of the Democratic defectors fall into that category. Freshman Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego of Texas tried to play down his vote as a rebuke of the President. ""For me personally, it was an issue of giving some people some time to transition to do things in an orderly way. There's clearly some issues that we'd like to fix and make better,"" he said. Rep. Ron Barber, another Democrat who faces a tough campaign next year in Arizona, also rejected the notion that a vote for the Republican bill would help undermine the entire Obamacare law. ""I think any fix that we can make, particularly when a problem arises, is good for the people back home. And look, the truth of the matter is: I'm accountable to the people who sent me here,"" Barber said. ""I respect our leadership on both sides of the aisle, but the leadership didn't elect me; my constituents did. And I'm going to make sure I listen to them, and do what I can to support them when they have problems and concerns, and that's what I'm doing in this case,"" he added. Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia told CNN on Thursday he was undecided on how he would vote but ultimately decided to vote against the GOP plan after he was briefed on the President's fix. ""The Upton bill did nothing to address the situation in which some individuals have had their coverage canceled by their insurance provider,"" Connolly said. ""We cannot allow Americans to be subjected to capricious cancellations, lifetime limits on their coverage, no coverage or unaffordable coverage because of pre-existing conditions and higher premiums based on gender for the same basic coverage."" The legislation proposed by Rep. Fred Upton would extend for a year those policies that were set to be canceled, and would allow anyone to purchase them. They are for the most part cheaper but they don't meet coverage demands spelled out under the Affordable Care Act. The fix: Obama tries to dig out of his big Obamacare hole . Obama . After the President's news conference on Thursday during which he said he ""fumbled"" the Affordable Care Act's launch, he immediately resumed his public relations tour touting the measure -- his signature domestic policy achievement. ""We're not going to gut the law. We're going to fix what needs to be fixed,"" Obama said in Cleveland. After fix, Obama vows not to 'gut' health care reform . Friday, he was back at the White House working to keep his promise to address its shortcomings as the Republican-led House took its own action to reverse the insurance policy cancellations. Obama met with insurance company CEOs whose help he needs to carry out freshly announced rules that would allow those receiving health policy cancellations due to Obamacare to keep their plans for another year. The discussion with the CEOs, who represented the country's major insurance carriers, revolved around the best paths for consumers to enroll in coverage. ""The discussion was productive -- the insurance CEOs and administration officials discussed the next steps in working with states and state insurance commissioners to use the new flexibility the administration announced to address cancellation notices going to consumers,"" the White House said in a statement. Everyone attending the meeting ""stressed the importance of working together to minimize disruption for consumers as well as the need to continue to reach consumers with clear information about their options and choices."" The White House did not detail the meeting nor did it disclose what, if any, potential solutions were offered. John King: For Obama, a bad turn or a tipping point? Senate Democrat alternative parked -- for the time being . Despite Obama's apology and efforts to make amends for saying previously that Americans wouldn't lose coverage under the law he championed, a couple of moderate Democrats in the Senate said they would still push for a legislative fix that goes a little further than the administrative steps outlined by the President on Thursday. ""I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them,"" Obama said on Thursday about Democrats who supported his bill and now face tougher reelection bids because of the law's difficult beginning. Vice President Joe Biden joined one of those Senators, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, at a campaign event on Friday. But Democrats who lead the Senate have indicated, however, that they will not bring up new Obamacare legislation for a vote for the moment, wanting to first see how the President's approach works. Republicans: We told you so . Republicans have spent much of the past three years attempting to defund and dismantle Obamacare as unworkable and an illegitimate law since it was rammed through by a Democratic Congress without their backing and then signed by a Democratic president. They have held hearings and investigations and the House has had dozens of votes to weaken or repeal it. Now, GOP lawmakers are seizing the moment with the law under fire to effectively say ""we told you so."" House Speaker John Boehner recently called Obamacare ""a failure"" and Democrats risk supporting it further at their political peril. Insurance companies . The White House did not mandate the changes on policy cancellations but asked insurance companies to take the lead and offer extensions. Health insurers, as represented by the America's Health Insurance Plans trade group, warned that last-minute changes in the law could ""destabilize the market and result in higher premiums."" The individual policy contracts that are most affected comprise about 5% of the overall insurance market. White House, insurers locked in unhappy marriage . At least one major insurer, Aetna, said it would allow for extensions, but put the burden on state insurance commissioners to approve the changes. These entities regulate industry and usually look out for consumer interests. They determine coverage standards and benefits. Insurers met with Obama at the White House on Friday where he said they would ""brainstorm"" on the best approach for carrying out his rule changes. State insurance commissions . Although they are ultimately responsible for allowing the extensions, an insurance commission source said state commissioners were ""not consulted"" prior to the President's announced administrative fix. 3 hurdles Obamacare must overcome . The reason for many cancellations was that affected plans didn't meet new federal standards for minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare. This includes preventative care, maternity care and mental health care. Washington State indicated that it would not allow a year extension, saying that it is too complicated and disruptive at this late date. More than canceled insurance plans . Canceled policies is not the only headache for Obama. The federally run website where consumers can purchase insurance, HealthCare.gov., barely functioned on its launch October 1. While improvements have been made, problems continue, making it difficult for people to enroll and browse plans offered by private companies. Including similar online exchanges offered through 36 states, overall Obamacare enrollment numbers for the first month underperformed with only 106,000 signing up for coverage. That's far from the seven million over time that experts anticipate will be needed to ensure that Obamacare works economically. It relies heavily on younger, healthier participants to help cover the cost of insuring older people who need more health care services. A bright spot, however, is the enrollment of Medicaid, which has been expanded in 25 states under the new law. Nearly half a million people have signed up for benefits under the federal health insurance program for the poor.

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Riot police descended on scores of anti-government protesters in the streets of Thailand's capital as violence intensified early Monday. Thai soldiers secure an area early Monday in Bangkok after dispersing protesters. Protesters took over two gas tanker trucks in one Bangkok intersection, ramping up the intensity of the ongoing conflict. ""We're at a freeway intersection and they've commandeered two gas tankers that they are threatening to blow up,"" CNN Correspondent Dan Rivers reported from the scene. Protesters elsewhere lit fires in the streets, blocked intersections and surrounded the prime minister's office, where there was no sign of security. Rivers said protesters had slashed the tires of a police van. Video from the scene showed shield-wielding riot police clashing with protesters, and at times people were carried away on stretchers. There were no immediate figures on deaths or injuries. ""What they're trying to do is face down the government, which so far has appeared -- it must be said -- very weak and unwilling to order the police or the army to use much force,"" Rivers said. ""That was, until a few hours ago where .. they have started to crack down on this movement."" Earlier, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva announced a state of emergency Sunday in the capital and surrounding areas in an attempt to tamp down days of heightening protests. Thousands of ""red shirt"" protesters have rallied for days to demand Abhisit's resignation. The red shirts have given the prime minister repeated deadlines to resign, but those have come and gone. The protesters are loyal to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup. They have said Abhisit's government was not democratically elected and want him to resign and schedule elections. iReport.com: ""Red shirts"" take to streets . Abhisit, who has held the position for four months, has rejected calls to step down. Meanwhile, Thaksin, in a video-link speech from an unknown location, urged his supporters to revolt, according to a report MCOT, a public company run under the supervision of the Thai prime minister's office. Thaksin said he would return to Thailand to lead people in a march on the capital if necessary, according to the report. Immediately after Abhisit's state-of-emergency declaration, dozens of protesters stormed the country's Interior Ministry and pelted Abhisit's car with rocks, chairs, flags and sticks as he escaped. Protesters climbed atop two military armored cars after laying down on the road and blocking its path. A police officer was led away by demonstrators and beaten, said Sathit Wongnongtoey, an official in the prime minister's office. The emergency measure will allow officials to arrest and detain protesters without a court order, and to restrict gatherings, authorities said. iReport.com: ""Numerous buses set ablaze"" Also Sunday, police arrested a leader of the red shirt movement -- named for the color of their demonstrators' attire. The leader, Arismun Pongruengrong, was charged with inciting people to break the law, police said. Arismun led demonstrators who forced their way into a hotel Saturday where Asian leaders were to meet. The action prompted the indefinite postponement of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in the southern coastal city of Pattaya.

"(CNN) -- The four New York Times staffers recently held captive for about a week by pro-Moammar Gadhafi troops made it out of Libya alive. However, they're unsure if their driver, Mohammed, did. And the experience is forcing the seasoned war journalists to reconsider how they look at the world. ""We probably should have died those first 12 hours, given, you know, the intensity of the firefight and the positions we were in,"" Anthony Shadid told Anderson Cooper on CNN's ""AC360."" But when Shadid and his colleagues Lynsey Addario, Stephen Farrell and Tyler Hicks emerged unscathed from the firefight, they fled right into the arms of their soon-to-be captors, who were manning a government checkpoint. Mohammed got out of their vehicle at the checkpoint. The journalists, who were blindfolded soon thereafter, aren't sure if they ever saw him again, but suspect the worst. Addario recalled, ""I looked over, and I saw our car, and one of the doors was open, and there was a guy taking out stuff and putting it on the sidewalk. And I looked down and next to the driver's side was a man, face down with one arm outstretched, and he clearly wasn't moving. And my initial thought was, 'It's Mohammed.' But I don't -- I didn't see his face, and it's hard to say, because we don't know. You know, there was so much chaos after the car was stopped."" Hicks said Mohammed was about 21 years old and a great driver. ""We've been checking the jails, the hospitals, morgues, everything,"" Hicks said. ""And still, nothing has come forward. And you know, this is all weighing very heavily on all of us... We feel this huge responsibility."" Shadid recently wrote in the Times that, ""If he died, we will have to bear the burden for the rest of our lives. And an innocent man died because of us, because of the wrong choices that we made for an article that was never worth dying for. No article is, but we were too blind to admit that."" When Cooper asked him about that quote, Shadid responded, ""I think the full impact of that burden is -- I mean, it's certainly starting to dawn on me. You know, why didn't I leave earlier? You know, why did I stay as long as I did. You know, you hope that you -- you're doing it, because that story wouldn't have been told otherwise. But even if that story wouldn't have been told otherwise, it wasn't worth someone's life."" Farrell said that the same gambles that can pay off with information for journalists can also put lives at risk. Hicks said that can cause psychological stress for loved ones. ""It was really quite emotional,"" he said. ""There are three days that my family, for example, didn't know if I was dead or alive. You know, that's a lot, a lot to put your family through and everyone else that you knew."" Addario says the psychological trauma she endured at the hands of her kidnappers has changed the way she sees people and prisoners. ""I've photographed prisoners with the hoods on and their hands bound, and I've never thought about what it feels like to be completely removed of all of your senses. I mean, it never dawned on me. Not that I'm insensitive, but I just -- because it's never happened to me before,"" she said. ""You have to dehumanize somebody, I think, before you can be violent,"" Shadid added. Ultimately, the journalists' shared humanity helped them pull through. ""There were moments when I was -- I couldn't stop crying. And I felt so weak and I -- and I tried to sort of muffle it. And I was trying not to cry,"" Addario remembers. ""Inevitably, one of [my colleagues] was sitting next to me and would say, 'There are people who love you. We're going to get out of this. You just have to get there,' you know. And so it's very helpful to have colleagues with you. I mean, we were so lucky that we were together.""

"(CNN) -- A Chinese high court has agreed to hear an appeal from convicted former Communist party senior Bo Xilai, according to a statement released by Jinan Intermediate People's Court. Bo Xilai was sentenced to life in prison for bribe-taking, as well as 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power after he was convicted in September.

During the politically sensitive trial, which took place over several days in August, Bo, 64, denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. The closely watched trial was considered to be much more transparent than most cases in China. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . But international and independent journalists weren't allowed inside the courtroom, and doubts were raised about the fullness of the court's version of events.

"(CNN) -- Unprotected sexual behavior among men who have sex with men has risen steadily since 2005, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control, released just before World AIDS Day. The data, drawn from the National HIV Health Behavior Surveillance System, indicated a rise in unprotected anal intercourse by 20% in a one-year period and were seen by some as a call to arms. Does this mean gay men are no longer worried about HIV? Many health commissioners and policy-makers on both the local and national levels, old-school activists, fellow academics and researchers and reporters used these data to augment their argument that HIV is no longer an issue of concern for gay men, whose primary route of transmission is unprotected anal sex. It has been suggested that gay men, especially young gay men, no longer fear contracting the disease, that AIDS is perceived as an easily managed chronic condition and that infection holds little consequence for those newly diagnosed. And then the ""blame game"" begins, which does nothing to help deal with the issue. Interactive: World AIDS Day 2013 . The reality is that some of my peers and members of my own generation, the AIDS Generation -- those of us who lived through the most dismal and darkest moments of AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s, prior to the implementation of effective therapies in 1996 -- also expressed similar horror when I interviewed them for my book last year. In fact, this very issue -- that of finger-pointing and assignment of blame and shame to gay men -- came through very clearly in the voices of the men during the course of our conversations and interviews. What came across from most of these 15 men reflected many emotions including concern, confusion and anger. But mostly what was obvious was a voice of disbelief among these men who became infected at time when we knew little about HIV/AIDS and who find it unfathomable that young gay men would place themselves at risk, given all that we know about the disease and its transmission three decades later. I often pushed back in these interviews to help these older men, the elder statesmen of the gay population, develop some more compassion about the lives and experiences of young gay men. For the past decade, I have been undertaking bio-behavioral studies of risk and resilience with young and emerging adult gay men. These studies include assessments of sexual behaviors and HIV testing. More than 30 years on, slow-motion AIDS catastrophe continues . And what is clear to me and my team at the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior and Prevention Studies is this: The notion that young men do not fear HIV nor are worried about HIV is a myth that needs to be dispelled. It undermines the lives and struggles of a new generation of gay men trying to make their places in the world and coming of age in this, the fourth decade of AIDS. It is obvious that the AIDS epidemic of my generation -- the loss and confusion and devastation that we witnessed for some two decades -- is not the same AIDS epidemic for new generation of young gay men. And for that I am eternally grateful. I am relieved that these young men will not have to experience the loss and death and trauma that we experienced, I am comforted in the fact that there are effective treatments available to help maintain their infection, and I am joyful every time another state enacts marriage equality, which puts our loving relationships on equal footing with heterosexual couples. The current state of affairs just makes the lives of a new generation of gay men different from those of the AIDS Generation, and we should celebrate that -- not let our anger, and the trauma and grief created by our own experiences, tarnish the progress we have made. But mostly, I am not in any position to judge the choices these men make about their sexual behaviors. The truth is that HIV is no longer a death sentence, and to expect a new generation of gay men to perceive it in that manner is unreasonable, unwarranted and unrealistic and seems to be dictated by anger on the part of some that HIV is no longer front and center in the minds of many young gay men -- or older gay men, either. Bill Gates: Where to put the smart money to end AIDS . The disease may not be front and center -- it may not be the primary presenting problem faced by young gay men, as it was for me at age 18 in 1981 -- but it is a concern. However, it's a concern that must be spoken about and dealt with differently for this ""new"" AIDS generation. In the end, a major tool we have in our arsenal in the fight against HIV rests in our own experiences. The artificial divide that exists between my generation, the AIDS Generation, and new generation of gay men must be bridged. As we emerge into these later stages of life, perhaps battle-scarred from 30 years of living through the AIDS crisis, we also have an obligation to act as mentors to a new generation of young gay men and share our stories of survival and resilience, as we learned from the generation that preceded us and lived through the Stonewall Riots and the onset of gay liberation. If we want to truly protect young gay men from HIV, we must share our life experiences and struggles openly and honesty, and we must release our judgments and biases about their lives and loves in a new and very different culture and world. Together, as one group, older and young, positive and negative, we can battle the true enemy: the virus that has plagued us for way too long. Opinion: Wrong time to reverse course on HIV/AIDS .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have arrested the leader of Mexico's largest union, accusing her of embezzling millions of dollars and using some of the money to pay for plastic surgery, shop at luxury stores and buy real estate. Elba Esther Gordillo, who has led Mexico's high-profile national teachers union for more than two decades, was in federal custody after she was arrested at an airport outside Mexico City on Tuesday, the country's attorney general told reporters. Investigators from Mexico's treasury found that 2.6 billion pesos (more than $200 million) had been routed from union funds into private bank accounts abroad, including some managed by Gordillo, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said. Some of the money was used to pay for $17,000 in plastic surgery, more than $2 million in purchases at a Neiman Marcus department store and a house in San Diego, California, prosecutors said. Gordillo, 68, is a powerful, well-known figure in Mexico, and news of her arrest sent shock waves through the country's political spheres. Her arrest comes as Mexico's government enacts sweeping education reforms that have been sharply criticized by the union. She was notably absent when Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto announced the education overhaul on Monday. Gordillo has led the union, the largest in Latin America with 1.5 million members, since 1989. She is widely known as ""La Maestra,"" Spanish for ""The Teacher."" A court issued an arrest warrant for her Sunday after ""many operations within the financial system,"" Murillo Karam said. ""It was identified that between 2008 and 2012, resources were diverted from the accounts of education workers, obviously from the union, to accounts of individual people,"" Murillo Karam said. The resources ""later were withdrawn in large quantities through cashier's checks and transfers triangulated to individuals and corporations"" inside Mexico and also in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, he said. Gordillo was expelled from Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party in 2006 and helped found the New Alliance party. CNNMexico.com could not immediately reach Gordillo's daughter, a senator for the New Alliance party, and the teacher's union had not responded to Gordillo's arrest late Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Theresa Borawski sat down heavily on a neighbor's porch, somewhere in between her front door and her good friend's driveway. The distance between the two was less than half a mile. It might as well have been 20. She had already taken a break on a tree stump near the road. This was the last stop, she told herself as she stood up from the porch slowly. She was going to make it. Reaching her friend's house was like reaching the finish line of a much longer race. ""I was just like I had run in a marathon,"" Borawski remembers. ""It was the biggest moment in my life."" ""He had to bring me home because I couldn't walk back,"" she laughs, ""but ..."" But the victory was sweet for a woman who just six months before had primarily relied on a wheelchair to get around, a woman who had lived in her house for two years without walking to the mailbox. At her heaviest in March 2011, Borawski weighed 428 pounds. ""I could no longer participate in life's activities and was forced to become a spectator while people around me lived their life,"" she wrote on iReport.com. ""Today, I am 276 pounds lighter, 14 jean sizes smaller, and no longer need a wheelchair, walker or cane to get around. I am a walking, talking miracle and have been given a second chance at life."" Borawski's father died when she was 8. Friends and family showed their sympathy with food. The lunch lady at school put extra fries on her tray; the neighbors gave her more candy at Halloween. Her grandparents were caterers, and their extended family got together often for exorbitant meals. ""I learned at a very young age that food makes the happy times better and the sad times more bearable,"" she says. She was heavy throughout high school and college but says her weight never really affected her life until 2003, when a series of setbacks sent her into a downward spiral. Borawski lost her church job of 15 years and moved more than 200 miles to start anew. She lost her grandfather and best friend back-to-back a few months later. Then her new job was cut from the church's budget. ""All of a sudden I'm 42 years old, living alone, unemployed, no income whatsoever,"" she says. So she comforted herself with food and decided to go back to college. Professor Chuck Bowden wasn't surprised by Borawski's amazing transformation. She caught his attention right away as a student willing to work hard. ""I already knew she was dedicated,"" Bowden says. ""I think starting over as a college freshman had to be a challenge -- almost just as impressive."" Over the next four years, Borawski gained weight steadily. Her doctor diagnosed her with rheumatoid arthritis, an extremely painful chronic disease that inflamed her joints. The extra pounds she was carrying only made the condition worse. She used a walker or cane to get around. When she graduated from Mid Michigan Community College, she could barely walk across the stage to get her diploma. By January 2011, ""my life was in complete chaos,"" Borawski says. She was working at the college and traveled around campus in an electric wheelchair. ""I always heard her whirring down the hall,"" Bowden remembers. He and Borawski had become friends and chatted often about the future. ""With the (arthritis) and the extra weight, I got very concerned that she might ... not be able to take care of herself."" His fears weren't far off. Borawski had difficulty standing long enough in the shower to wash and condition her hair. She could only shop at stores that had mobile carts; it took her a week to carry in her groceries from the car because she could only carry one or two bags at a time. She was seriously considering moving into an assisted living facility. ""I could barely function,"" Borawski says. She got up, rode around in her wheelchair, popped painkillers, ate and went to bed every night at 7 p.m. ""Every bit of energy I had went to just living."" Her wake-up call came on March 1, 2011. Her sister phoned to tell her she was getting bariatric surgery. Borawski pleaded with her not to -- she had heard horror stories about the procedure's aftereffects. When the sister hung up, Borawski went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of peach soda. ""Something just clicked in my head,"" she says. A quick calculation made Borawski realize she had been drinking nearly 7,000 calories a week in soda -- the equivalent of 2 pounds. She opened up the bottle and dumped it down the drain. Then she did the same with the rest of her stash. At that moment, Borawski gave up sugar cold turkey. Ten days later, she went to the doctor and had lost 7 pounds. She bought a calorie-counting book on the way home and started reading food labels. Soon after, she restricted her calorie intake to 1,000 calories a day (experts warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day because it sends your body into starvation mode). She says she wasn't hungry at that limit because of her lack of mobility. ""Because I was so heavy, I had a lot of success really quickly. I lost 45 pounds between March and Memorial Day."" In October 2011, Borawski walked to her mailbox without a cane for the first time. Her next trip was to the neighbor's mailbox. The first time she walked down the steps at work, her student assistant cheered. Almost a year later, she showed up in Bowden's office doorway. He never heard her coming. ""There's a chance we may have done a little dance in the hall,"" he says with a laugh. ""To see somebody walk again? I considered that miraculous."" Every time she lost 20 pounds, Borawski went to the store and bought a pair of pants in the next size smaller. They sat in the corner of her room until she could pull them on. They were her motivation when she was tempted to cheat. To celebrate losing 200 pounds, she bought a black and white diamond ring. She wears it every day as a reminder never to go back. ""The first row of black diamonds is the first 100 pounds, the second row is the second 100 pounds,"" she says. ""The white diamonds in between are the new life I've found."" Last month, Borawski walked three miles for the first time. She does 200 to 300 squats a day to strengthen her legs after years of immobility. She eats around 1,400 calories to maintain her weight at a healthy 150 pounds. Her rheumatoid arthritis has improved significantly, and her doctors are ""amazed and impressed"" at her overall health. Borawski's goals now are simple: to walk a 5K in September and to inspire others. She keeps her electric wheelchair in her office with a sign: ""Theresa doesn't live here anymore."" ""The key for me was finding a plan that I could live with for the rest of my life,"" she wrote on iReport. ""I am a brand new person, have so much energy and am now a participant in life, rather than just watching it pass me by. I am blessed beyond measure and can't wait to see what the future holds for me!"" Have you lost weight?

"Sbeineh, Syria (CNN) -- Sbeineh was once a thriving town on the southern outskirts of Damascus. Residents of the Syrian capital came to buy their furniture here and many factories, now abandoned, still line the main street into town. But the grinding, two-and-a-half-year war here has reduced Sbeineh to rubble. Its residents first fled when the town fell into the hands of rebels battling to bring an end to the reign of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But in early November the Syrian army reclaimed Sbeineh after a long and costly siege. The military pounded rebel positions with tanks, artillery and heavy machine guns for weeks in the lead-up to the siege. Assad's men then raided the town, taking it back house by house. Various opposition groups that had occupied Sbeineh blamed each other for losing the battle, saying some rebel fighters had put up very little resistance against government troops. We toured the destroyed town with a detachment from the Syrian army led by a soldier who goes by the name of Abu Aksam. ""Is this their freedom?"" Abu Aksam said, walking past a pock-marked building. ""Everything is broken."" The soldiers walked us through a block of interconnected houses, where the rebels who occupied Sbeineh for nearly a year punched holes through the walls in order to move safely from apartment to apartment, rather than fall prey to a sniper's scope out in the streets. Government soldiers also uncovered a series of tunnels that the rebels were using to get supplies towards the front line. In one apartment we find a huge hole in the ground leading down to a tunnel used to smuggle weapons and ammunition to a sniper's vantage point at the other end. ""Our soldiers took heavy casualties from this position,"" Abu Aksam said. ""It was very difficult to get this done, but we did it, and we will keep going until the end because we believe in our country."" Syrian troops showed us various locations in Sbeineh they claim served as headquarters for rebel groups ranging from the moderate Free Syrian Army to the Islamist Jabhat al-Nusra. Aksam also took us to a room that he says served as weapons-manufacturing workshop for opposition fighters. Aksam says rebels used these improvised mini-factories to make mortars, rockets and improvised bombs. ""They used the tools to make mortars and rockets and used gas cylinders to make very large bombs,"" he said, standing amid the debris inside the room. The government says Sbeineh was vital for resupplying its fighters in the southern outskirts of Damascus. Losing areas around the capital dealt a heavy blow to the Syrian regime's efforts to win the war, and the government has made it a priority to take the suburbs back. The Syrian army's victory at Sbeineh was a strategic triumph for the government as it tries to unseat rebels from the large swaths of territory they've taken east and south of the capital. But while the soldiers rejoice at their hard-fought win, the real losers are the citizens of this once vibrant suburb who won't be able to return any time soon.

"(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey didn't pussyfoot around. She got Lance Armstrong to confess in the first minute. It was a curiously unemotional moment, the prosecutor leading the witness through what seemed like well-rehearsed paces in a businesslike fashion. Armstrong said he was sorry for all the years of lying, but he sounded like he was reading a shopping list. He may have been wearing a lavender shirt that complemented Oprah's violet dress, but the disgraced cycling champion was anything but colorful. On her cable channel Thursday night, Winfrey wisely began with a series of yes-or-no questions that brought a decade of deception to an end. Did Armstrong take banned substances? Yes. EPO? Yes. Blood transfusions? Yes. In winning all seven Tour de France titles? Yes. If you changed the channel then, you didn't miss much. Watch: Why the media fell for the Manti Te'o girlfriend hoax . It was the most eagerly anticipated interview since Monica Lewinsky sat down with Barbara Walters (except there was no sex, lies and audiotape, just lies). But the event had an anticlimactic feel. First came the leak (to the New York Times) that Armstrong was considering coming clean. Then came the leak (to USA Today) that he planned to confess to Oprah. Then came the leak (to the AP) that he had in fact told Oprah he'd been a doper. So all that remained to be seen were what words Armstrong would use and what demeanor he would display. Watch: Joe Scarborough apologizes to Mika Brzezinski (finally) He just didn't seem contrite. ""You brazenly and deliberately denied everything you've just admitted to me,"" Winfrey said. No dispute. ""You called other people liars."" True. Armstrong didn't so much engage in the interview as endure it. He admitted he could not have won those Tour de France titles without doping. He said he didn't think he'd get caught. But he never quite explained the audacious, elaborate and endless lying. ""The story was so perfect for so long,"" Armstrong said. That's right, perfectly untrue. When Winfrey forced him to watch a videotaped deposition in which he lied about doping, Armstrong appeared halting and detached. He later said he was embarrassed but didn't appear so. She could not get the man to open up. Watch: Tina Fey's Twitter Tirade: Will it come back to haunt her? Armstrong said he didn't feel he was cheating at the time; he was leveling the playing field. It was as though he was talking about someone else. Even when Armstrong acknowledged having been a bully, there was no flicker of soul-searching. Maybe he doesn't have a soul to search. The sit-down, part two of which airs Friday night, was a test for both of them. Armstrong's task was to generate enough public sympathy to allow him to salvage a once-glittering career that he single-handedly ruined. He utterly failed. Winfrey's challenge was to reclaim a bit of the cultural spotlight that she once owned before abandoning her syndicated stardom for the cable netherworld. She clearly succeeded. You've got to say this. Everyone wanted the Armstrong interview. He could have gone to ""60 Minutes"" or the ""Today"" show or ""Katie."" But Oprah landed him. She is still seen as having the requisite mix of toughness and empathy to be able to deal with stars who have misbehaved, though Armstrong's misconduct is on a different level than your stereotypical celebrity in rehab. Watch: Is the press demanding that Obama party more? David Zurawik, the Baltimore Sun television critic, argues that the landscape has changed. By the time Winfrey gave up her show, he says, ""the media had fragmented on one front, making it harder for TV to serve as pop culture's big revival tent for the ritual of confession, forgiveness and rebirth.""

"(CNN) -- In a stunning reversal of fortunes, Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy was deposed by a military coup just one year after being sworn in as president. The Egyptian protesters who took to the streets by the millions over the past several days to demand Morsy's resignation were jubilant as news spread Wednesday that their goal had been met: Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood-backed government was gone, along with its creeping authoritarianism and mismanagement. The leaders of the protest movement are insisting that what happened was not a military coup, but rather a remarkably peaceful demonstration of the will of the people to achieve the original goals of the revolution: bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity. Morsy's embittered supporters see it quite differently: Even as their democratically elected leader was talking compromise with an opposition that would have none of it, he was pushed out of office by a military that positioned its tanks in strategic locations throughout the capital, took control of state media, and has placed Morsy and key advisers under house arrest. The Muslim Brotherhood website on Thursday warned of a ""new era of repression and tyranny."" They know of what they speak: There is a long, dark history of Egypt's military rulers brutalizing Muslim Brotherhood leaders. Within 20 years of its founding in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, a charismatic schoolteacher and preacher, the Muslim Brotherhood was disbanded by the Egyptian government, which felt threatened by its rapid spread. The Brotherhood, a popular grass-roots political, social and religious movement, had attracted a huge following with its simple slogan, ""Islam is the solution,"" and its provision of social services. By the time it was banned in 1948, it had nearly 2 million members. Several violent decades followed as increasingly radical Brotherhood members took up arms in an attempt to realize their goal of creating an Islamic state. But by the 1970s, the organization renounced violence and vowed to participate in the political process. Still, the government barely tolerated the Brotherhood; under longtime President Hosni Mubarak, Brotherhood leaders were regularly arrested in crackdowns. Although the Brotherhood did not lead the events of January 2011 that toppled the Mubarak regime, it quickly capitalized on them to become the political front-runner in post-revolutionary Egypt. Aware that it was held in deep suspicion by many at home and abroad, the Brotherhood at first vowed not to dominate the country's new politics. ""We will not have a presidential candidate,"" promised Mohamed Morsy. ""We want to participate and help. We are not seeking power."" But that promise quickly faded as the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, buoyed by its superior organizational structure and credentials as a stalwart opposition, took the largest number of seats in the new parliament (43.4%) and then won the presidency. The Brotherhood's secular opponents became increasingly uncomfortable that they were watching a slow-motion takeover of the country by an organization that at heart remained secretive, autocratic and theocratic. From the start, Egypt's political stage was set for an impasse between secularists and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, who believed they had won a mandate to govern the country and shape Egypt's future in their Islamist vision. The Islamists never seemed to acknowledge that Morsy had won the presidency in a runoff with barely a majority of votes (51.7%), and that in the first round of voting, his secular opponents combined had more than 55% of the vote. Morsy behaved arrogantly, pushing through a controversial constitution with little consensus, passing a highly divisive edict putting the president's actions above judicial review, and in his most recent politically tone-deaf move, appointing 17 provincial governors last week, all affiliated or allied with the Muslim Brotherhood -- including an astonishingly divisive member of Gamaa Islamiya, the organization responsible for the devastating 1997 massacre of 58 tourists in Luxor. For their part, secularists never accepted the legitimacy of the Morsy government and vowed to prevent political Islam from taking hold. The judiciary, filled with holdovers from the Mubarak regime, tried to use the courts to undermine the Morsy government. Leaders of the opposition deemed any Morsy effort to compromise as half-hearted and refused to test the political process. Against this background of political polarization, the country staggers under a teetering economy. The millions of Egyptians who filled the streets in recent days demanding Morsy's resignation were protesting not only his authoritarian tendencies, but also his economic mismanagement. Egypt's fate now hangs on whether Egypt's secularists and Islamists can be reconciled. Thursday's statement by the National Salvation Front, the alliance of opposition parties -- stressing that no parties, ""particularly political Islamic groups"" should be excluded from ongoing reconciliation talks -- is a positive one. So too are Morsy's calls for his supporters to pursue only peaceful protests. But the crux of the matter is that the process of writing a new constitution, which the military has promised to oversee, is unlikely to give Islam as preferred a position as the one that Morsy pushed through. Will extremist Islamists conclude that violence is the only way they can achieve their goal of an Islamic state? The specter of Algeria's civil war hangs heavily over the situation: In 1991, the Algerian military took control of the government after Islamists looked poised to come to power through elections. The ensuing decade of conflict left as many as 100,000 dead. Ultimately, the role of Islam in the state must be settled by the people themselves. If Egyptians approve, through a fair and open referendum, a new constitution that reduces Islam's role, it will take the wind out of the sails not only of the Muslim Brotherhood, but of political Islam across the region. But if Egypt returns to a cycle of repression and violence, it will only serve to revitalize a radical movement. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Isobel Coleman.","Muslim Brotherhood decries coup, recalls history of military rulers brutalizing its leaders .
After Morsy's win, secularists feared a takeover by theocratic Muslim Brotherhood .

Coleman: Egypt must choose secular or Islamist rule, hope Islamists don't turn to violence ."
"(CNN) -- The varying response to Egypt's uprising across the Middle East largely reflects different views on the role of the Muslim Brotherhood; while Turkey has condemned the coup, an assortment of voices from Israel to the Gulf to the Syrian government have all been cheering this sudden blow to the Islamists who seemed to be in the ascendance across the region just a few months ago. Regional governments who feared the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood are broadly pleased to see the army return as the key power-broker, as they believe it will restore order, stability and predictability. But the army did not act alone. It was enabled to move by mass popular protests that temporarily brought extremely disparate groups together -- united only by their opposition to Morsy. The lesson the protesters will be drawing is that protests still work. While Egypt's future is too uncertain to make it a model that others immediately want to emulate, this fresh demonstration of the power of the street will again inspire protest movements elsewhere in the Arab world, whether demonstrating against long-established authoritarian regimes, or newer elected Islamist counterparts. Just as the protesters may in time grow more skeptical about the role of the army, the authoritarian governments that are welcoming the change in Egypt may also come to regret applauding a fresh uprising.

Egypt's foreign policy did not change dramatically under the Brotherhood -- nor is it likely to change dramatically under a weaker transitional government of national unity. Even after elections, the likely scenario is a coalition government representing a fragmented polity, probably preoccupied with internal issues more than taking dramatic foreign-policy stances. But the overthrow of the Arab world's first elected president from a Muslim Brotherhood party has international reverberations, since the Muslim Brotherhood exists in some form in virtually every Arab country and beyond. For years, local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood have been judged to be the most well-organized opposition movements in many of the authoritarian countries of the Arab world, where heavy restrictions on civil society and party organizations have often pushed political opposition underground and into the mosques. After the Arab uprisings, parties associated with the international Muslim Brotherhood were the most successful groups in elections in Egypt and Tunisia, though less so in Libya. They've been major players in the uprisings in Yemen and in Syria. And before all this, it was Hamas -- an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood -- that won the Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006, the last time elections were permitted in the Palestinian territories. Read more: Get ready for extremist backlash . The only country where the Brotherhood has been able to consolidate power over a number of years has been Turkey, whose ruling party, the Justice and Development Party, is associated with the organization. Turkey has also faced hefty protests in recent weeks as opponents of the government accuse Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of arrogance, crude majoritarianism, and trying to impose a monolithic Islamist identity on a diverse society -- but while these criticisms echo those made of Morsy, Erdogan has been able to consolidate his power to a far greater degree, not least because he has overseen a decade of successful economic development, whereas Egypt's economy has suffered from 2011 as political uncertainty has deterred investors and tourists. All this means the stakes in Egypt are very high. Mohammed Morsy and his supporters, whose thinking has been shaped by their years in opposition under a dictatorship, were well aware that they faced regional opposition, but hoped that if they were careful not to alienate the West, they would be allowed to remain in office. Thus, they focused on consolidating their domestic power, but did not seriously challenge the regional order; Morsy brokered a ceasefire when conflict erupted between Israel and militias in the Gaza Strip last year, and the Brotherhood emphasised its openness to and interest in Western investment. But they often erred by trying to discredit all of Egypt's diverse and vocal political opposition as if it was merely a foreign-sponsored counter-revolutionary force. Just at the time when they most needed to reach out, as the scale of the opposition became evident in this week's street protests, they spoke disparagingly about the opposition, saying, for instance, that protesters were being sponsored by Ahmed Shafiq, Mubarak's last prime minister, who Morsy narrowly defeated in the presidential run-off a year ago, and who is now living in the Gulf. Indeed, many in the Gulf will be glad to see the Muslim Brotherhood ""brand"" damaged, even if they have their doubts about the methods of mass street protests. The United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nayhan, was among the first officials to congratulate Egypt after the military announced a new president would take charge. This came just two days after the UAE sentenced 68 dissidents, including a cousin of the ruler of the emirate of Sharjah, to jail sentences for plotting to overthrow the government, accusing them of belonging to an underground group associated with the Brotherhood. Earlier this month the UAE also arrested several Egyptians accused of forming an underground Muslim Brotherhood cell there. The news poses much more of a dilemma for Qatar, which, unlike all the other Gulf monarchies, was quick to lend its support to Arab protest movements, at least as long as they stayed outside the Gulf. The tiny, gas-rich emirate has built strong ties with the Muslim Brotherhood ruling parties in Egypt and Tunisia. Now, its 33 year-old new emir, who has been in power only two weeks since the abdication of his father, may need to chart a different course and make some hurried outreach to a wider range of political movements -- which might include more conservative Islamist groups, like Egypt's Salafist parties, as well as leftist and liberal groups. The new emir has congratulated Egypt's new president, though not as quickly as the UAE or Kuwait did. Israel's cabinet has been ordered not to speak publicly about Morsy's overthrow, presumably for fear that if Israeli officials comment, they'll immediately be blamed, in a region prone to conspiracy theories. In fact their feelings are likely to be mixed: Israel sees the Muslim Brotherhood's ideology as a profound security threat, but they had continued to cooperate with the Egyptian authorities on border security, and will now be concerned that the fresh political uncertainty could distract the army from securing the large and often lawless Sinai region along Israel's border, home to a number of jihadi movements. The United States has also sent mixed messages: it did not want to call for the overthrow of an elected president just one year into office, though it had been warning him to listen to his people. But Obama has stopped short of calling Morsy's overthrow a military coup, even though the intervention of the army to change the president and suspend the constitution fits virtually every known definition of a coup. The semantics are political: the U.S .wants to retain leverage with the Egyptian military, and if it labels their actions a coup, it would ordinarily be obliged to cut off its military aid, normally around $1.2B per year. The beleaguered Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has also been cheered by the sight of a military coup against the Muslim Brotherhood, since the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood forms a significant part of the opposition to his own military regime. Assad has declared this the end of political Islam, blithely ignoring the fact his own main external allies are Iran and Hezbollah. The Brotherhood's critics see Morsy's overthrow -- along with the political transition in Qatar and even the protests in Turkey -- as the end of an era for these Islamists. For their part, the Brotherhood will see this as a temporary reversal, just as Turkey too faced successive military coups. The question is whether Egypt, and other countries in the region, will be able to accommodate a movement that is no longer a majority but is still the best organized political force in many countries, or whether it will again be driven underground. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Kinninmont.","Kinninmont says differing views on Egypt's uprising reflect views on the Muslim Brotherhood .

"London (CNN) -- Veteran cagefighter Usman Raja has so far worked to deradicalize 10 convicted terrorists after they completed their prison terms in the UK. His work combines teaching Mixed Martial Arts skills and a humanistic and tolerant interpretation of Islam that traces its roots back to the Prophet Mohammed. His success has been noted by British officials who are trying to work out if it can be replicated on a larger scale. Read how Raja's controversial technique works, is changing lives, and getting noticed. Here are some of his cases: . Abu Bakr Mansha, a British-Pakistani, who is now 28, was in 2005 convicted of terrorism in what prosecutors alleged was a thwarted plot he embarked on that year to track down and kill or severely harm a British soldier who had returned from Iraq. He had pleaded not guilty to a charge of possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Mansha was released in 2009 under strict conditions but recalled to prison several months later because he was assessed as still dangerous. After he was again released in March 2011, he entrusted himself to Raja, under whose mentorship he appears to have shed his radical views. Mansha's police mug shot was used in British newspaper stories warning of a threat from released terrorist convicts to the Olympic Games. He says he now wants to stop other young Muslims from repeating his mistakes. ""I learned the hard way,"" he told CNN. Raja said his first terrorist case was Yassin Nassari, now 33, a British-Syrian resident of London, who was arrested by police after he landed in Luton airport in 2006 after a trip overseas. Police say they found instructions on how to make a viable rocket on his hard-drive, and at his home violent videos of terrorist attacks and beheadings. The following year Nassari was found guilty of possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. According to Raja, when he was released in 2008, Nassari was very reluctant to work with Muslim community groups enlisted by probation services to rehabilitate offenders. But Nassari heard about Raja through friends who had trained with him in mixed martial arts and agreed to meet him. In the early summer of 2009 they met in a probation office in London and from there Nassari wanted to work with Raja. He said Nassari was interested in getting mixed martial arts training, and the instruction he gave him in cage fighting allowed him to build up a mentoring relationship. The two had wide-ranging discussions about Islam, during which time Raja was able to impress upon Nassari his humanistic approach to the religion. ""What I think he recognized was our sincerity - that we were doing this for the infinite good,"" Raja told CNN. The former convict is now working at a charity providing a support structure for Muslims convicted of criminal offenses after their release from prison, according to Raja. Andrew Rowe . Raja described how another one of his early success stories was Andrew Rowe, a radicalized British-Jamaican convert who was 34 when convicted in 2005 of terrorism offenses after instructions on how to fire mortars, a coded list of methods of attack, possible targets, and traces of explosive were found on his possessions. Rowe had travelled to several Jihadist fronts, including Bosnia, Chechnya, Pakistan and Afghanistan and was described as ""a global terrorist [who] has been trained and knows how to use extreme violence,"" by a senior British counter-terrorism official. Raja says Rowe began training on mixed martial arts whilst in prison. On his release Raja provided him with further martial arts instruction, which helped him forge a mentoring relationship. Raja said Rowe was already looking to improve his religious understanding, making him open to Raja's message. Other Cases . Raja has also worked with two men convicted of terrorism offenses in relation to the failed July 21, 2005 bombing attack on London, a man convicted of a terrorist arson attack, as well as several other former terrorist convicts. He is set to take on several more released terrorist convicts in the coming months.

"(CNN) -- Atlanta police have launched an internal investigation into filmmaker Tyler Perry's claim he was racially profiled by two white officers who pulled his car over, the police department said. Perry, one of America's most successful film and television producers, put a post on Facebook on Sunday describing a tense encounter with police, which he suggested ""could have turned for the worse."" ""It was so hostile,"" wrote Perry, who is African-American. ""I was so confused. It was happening so fast that I could easily see how this situation could get out of hand very quickly. I didn't feel safe at all."" The Atlanta Police Department gave a statement to CNN on Wednesday confirming that two officers recently ""encountered Mr. Tyler Perry during a traffic stop."" ""Mr. Perry's concerns, as recently expressed by him publicly, will be the basis for referral of the matter to the department's Office of Professional Standards,"" the statement said. ""OPS has opened an investigation to determine if Mr. Perry's claims can be substantiated, and whether any departmental policies or procedures were violated during the stop."" The investigation began Tuesday, and no action has been taken against the officers involved, a police spokesman said. Perry acknowledged that he made a left turn from a right lane, which a police officer told him was illegal and the reason for stopping him. It was a practice recommended by his security team in case he was being followed, Perry said. The misunderstanding and tension described by Perry suggests that the two white officers did not recognize him as one of Atlanta's richest and best-known citizens. It happened a few days before Perry hosted President Obama at his studio on March 17, he said. The tension was defused after another police cruiser pulled up to the scene, Perry wrote. ""This officer was a black guy,"" Perry wrote. ""He took one look at me and had that 'Oh No' look on his face."" The black officer spoke ""in a hushed tone"" to the two white officers, he said. ""After that, one of the officers stayed near his car while one came back, very apologetic,"" Perry wrote. Perry did not identify the officers or specify which police department in the Atlanta metropolitan area they were from. Perry posed a question to his readers: ""Do you see how quickly this could have turned for the worse?"" Perry's posting, which has drawn more than 101,000 ""likes"" and 18,426 comments, told what happened when two white police officers stopped him even though he has directed and acted in at least 16 feature films. But his movies are most popular among African-American audiences, and Perry is often dressed in drag as his ""Madea"" character. The traffic stop happened near Perry's southwest Atlanta movie studio last month, according to the posting. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","Atlanta police confirm officers stopped Tyler Perry's car last month .

"(CNN)  -- A rising Canadian folk singer was killed by coyotes this week in a national park in Nova Scotia, a park spokesman said Thursday. Taylor Mitchell, 19, was at the beginning of the Skyline Trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park on Tuesday afternoon when she was attacked, according to Chip Bird, the Parks Canada field unit superintendent for Cape Breton. Bird said hikers saw the coyotes attacking Mitchell and called 911. She was airlifted to a hospital in Halifax, where she died about 12 hours later, he said. Mitchell was recently nominated for Young Performer of the Year honors by Canadian Folk Music Awards. She was touring the Maritime provinces and had a break between gigs to go hiking Tuesday, her manager, Lisa Weitz, said in an e-mail. ""She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity,"" she wrote. ""Words can't begin to express the sadness and tragedy of losing such a sweet, compassionate, vibrant, and phenomenally talented young woman,"" Weitz said. ""Her warmth, loving nature, astounding artistry, and infectious enthusiasm will be so missed and forever remembered."" Read more about who Taylor Mitchell was . Mitchell, who was originally from the Georgian Bay area in Ontario, lived in Toronto, Weitz said. Bird said the area where the attack occurred is popular and well traveled. It remained closed, and park authorities had shot one coyote believed to be involved. A pathologist will test the animal's body for diseases that might have triggered the attack, he said. Searches for other aggressive animals in the park continue, he said. ""Public safety is our primary concern,"" he said. He said no other coyote attacks had ever occurred in the park. ""We've had coyotes approach people too closely,"" he said, and about six years ago one nipped a person. That animal was killed because of ""lack of fear,"" he said. But Tuesday's attack is ""unprecedented and a totally isolated incident,"" he said. In a written statement, Emily Mitchell described her daughter as ""a seasoned naturalist and well versed in wilderness camping. She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity. Tragically it was her time to be taken from us so soon. ""We take a calculated risk when spending time in nature's fold -- it's the wildlife's terrain,"" Emily Mitchell's statement continued. ""When the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes, I clearly heard Taylor's voice say, 'please don't, this is their space.' She wouldn't have wanted their demise, especially as a result of her own. She was passionate about animals, was an environmentalist, and was also planning to volunteer at the Toronto Wildlife Centre in the coming months."" Send your stories, photos of Mitchell . Michael Johnston, Mitchell's producer for her debut album, ""For Your Consideration,"" said the singer was a ""brilliant and beautiful light that people were naturally drawn to."" ""She was so young and talented. Her big dreams were a perfect match with her big, kind heart."" He said he and his family would soon be organizing a celebration of her life. Coyote attacks on humans are extremely rare, said Michael O'Brien, wildlife manager of furbearers and upland game for Nova Scotia. It is ""not expected or normal behavior,"" he said, although he said there had been aggressive incidents in Nova Scotia before, but no deaths. Illness, injury and familiarity with humans can affect an animal's behavior, he said.","Taylor Mitchell was at the Skyline Trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park .

"(CNN) -- Homicide detectives outside Baltimore are investigating an apparent murder-suicide involving a police officer and a firefighter. Three people were found dead inside a home in Glen Burnie, Maryland, early Sunday morning after a reported shooting around 1:35 a.m., police in Anne Arundel County said. Police said the suspected shooter -- Christopher Lee Robinson, 37, a Baltimore police officer -- was one of the people found dead at the scene. Baltimore firefighter Andrew Scott Hoffman, 27, and Marie Leanne Edith Hartman, 26, were killed. ""Preliminary investigation indicates that the suspect/shooter was one of the deceased and that he had a relationship with the female victim,"" police said. Police said they were still investigating the shooter's motive, but described the shooting as a ""domestic incident."" ""It's a tragic situation. ... We believe this incident is all connected to some known relationships,"" Anne Arundel County police spokesman Lt. T.J. Smith told CNN affiliate WBFF. Hoffman was a third-generation member of the fire department who had worked for the city since 2006, Baltimore Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said in a statement, according to WBFF.

"(CNN) -- It may have made the biggest splash, with the usual tech-world buzz that arises around any Apple product announcement. But the iPad Air wasn't the only new tablet rolled out on Tuesday. Both Microsoft and Nokia unveiled entries they hope will compete with Apple, Amazon's Kindle Fires, Google's Nexus tablets and a slew of other tabs running Google's Android operating system. Nokia's first full-size tablet, the Lumia 2520, has a 10-inch display screen and runs a version of the the Windows 8 operating system. It sells for $499, with 4G LTE and a 6.7-megapixel back-facing camera. It was introduced Tuesday, the same day Microsoft rolled out its next generation of tablet-laptop hybrids for sale. The Surface 2 starts at $449 for a 32GB model. It's thinner and more powerful than its predecessor and drops the confusing ""RT"" from the end of its name. The souped-up Surface Pro 2 starts at $899 and runs all the way up to a whopping 512GB version (for $1,799) that puts that model closer to the laptop end of the spectrum. That's just two more names jumping into the tablet fray as the holiday shopping season approaches. On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that iPads account for 81% of all the world's tablet usage, suggesting sales and customer satisfaction combine to make it the hands-down leader in the field. That may well be true. It's certainly hard to argue with the 170 million sales figure Cook announced for all iPads since they were introduced in 2010. But just two years ago, that usage number would have been closer to 100%, meaning the rest of the field has started chipping away at Apple's lead. Samsung's Galaxy Tabs, in 10-and-7-inch varieties, have made a relatively strong run and Google's Nexus 7 has gotten almost unanimously positive reviews, with some critics declaring it superior to Apple's smaller iPad Mini. All of which is to say that, when holiday shoppers are looking to shell out cash for a tablet this year, they'll have more options than ever. In the gallery above, we take a closer look at some of the top tablets on the market, as well as some of their newest competitors.","iPad Air isn't the only new tablet hitting the market this week .

"(CNN) -- The district attorney of Boulder County, Colorado, says he cannot say if he would have signed an indictment against the parents of JonBenet Ramsey -- the 6-year-old beauty queen killed in 1996 -- as a predecessor declined to do three years after the child's death. ""I don't know if I would have made the same decision, but I know how difficult these decisions are,"" Stan Garnett wrote in his first comments after the release of the indictment. Previously sealed court documents released Friday show that a Colorado grand jury voted in 1999 to indict John and Patsy Ramsey, JonBenet's parents, on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime. But then-District Attorney Alex Hunter said there was insufficient evidence to warrant filing charges, and he did not sign the indictment. From the beginning, John Ramsey and his late wife maintained they had nothing to do with their daughter's death. His lawyer has said there was no evidence to prosecute them, and they were later exonerated by DNA tests. Garnett, who took office in 2009, wrote a lengthy op-ed in Sunday's Daily Camera of Boulder explaining his position on the case, which captured national media attention after the little girl was found dead in her family's home the day after Christmas 1996. Garnett wrote that he had his staff look at the case after he took office four years ago. His appellate department told him the statute of limitations had run out on the charges in the indictment. As for any other charge, the DA's staff found nothing to pursue, he said. Garnett wrote he will not comment on the case -- at this time. ""My, or my staff's view of what the evidence in the Ramsey case proves will only be stated in open court if a case is ever filed,"" he wrote, adding the Ramseys are entitled to the ""full presumption of innocence."" Ramsey attorney wants full review . On Friday, an attorney for John Ramsey and his family urged Garnett to publicly open ""the entire grand jury record and not just four pages from an 18-month investigation that produced volumes of testimony and exhibits."" The released indictments ""are nonsensical,"" said attorney L. Lin Wood. ""They reveal nothing about the evidence reviewed by the grand jury and are clearly the result of a confused and compromised process. The Ramsey family and the public are entitled to the benefit of the full and complete record, not just a historical footnote. Fairness dictates that result."" Wood, in a statement, said the grand jury didn't have what was later to be ""the conclusive 2008 DNA testing that led to the unequivocal, public exoneration of the Ramsey family by the Boulder district attorney."" That year, another district attorney, Mary Lacy, wrote a letter to John Ramsey, saying that new DNA evidence tests had cleared him, his late wife and their son. She formally apologized for the cloud of suspicion the Ramseys had lived under for years. Garnett wrote that a district attorney's job is to seek justice, not to forgive, ""and rarely to 'exonerate.' "" He said he believes ""straying from this role can be very confusing to the public and can create false impressions of certainty about uncertain evidence, subject to conflicting inferences, that has never been presented and tested in open court."" 'A killer on the loose' The Ramsey case has never been tried, something that frustrates the community, Garnett wrote. ""Because no case has ever been brought against anyone in (the) Ramsey (case), the community has had no resolution and the tabloid press has been free to speculate, sometimes recklessly, based on only parts of the evidence,"" he said. In the days after the killing, Boulder police and the media focused on John and Patsy Ramsey. The parents always insisted that an intruder had killed JonBenet. ""There's a killer on the loose,"" Patsy Ramsey said a few days after her daughter's body was found. ""I don't know who it is. I don't know if it's a she or a he, but ... there's someone out there."" Investigators say they did not find any sign of forced entry into the family home in 1996. No footprints were found in the snow outside the home, either. A paintbrush from her mother's hobby kit was used to tighten the rope that choked JonBenet, according to investigators. An alleged ransom letter came from a notepad inside the house and made reference to little-known details about the family's past finances. In October 1999, grand jurors assigned to the case went back home, sworn to silence. The eight women and four men had convened regularly for 13 months. They heard from dozens of witnesses, considered 30,000 pieces of evidence. Today, the investigation stands almost where it started -- no arrests and no solid suspects. Documents unsealed . Judge J. Robert Lowenbach last week ordered the release of four pages of sealed documents, as requested by Boulder journalists. The court documents show how the grand jury sought to charge each parent with two identical counts. The grand jury had alleged that Patsy Ramsey, who died from ovarian cancer in 2006, and John Ramsey ""did ... permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health which resulted in the death of JonBenet Ramsey."" The grand jury also had alleged that each parent ""did ... render assistance to a person, with intent to hinder, delay and prevent the discovery, detention, apprehension, prosecution, conviction and punishment of such person for the commission of a crime, knowing the person being assisted has committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death."" The documents provide no further details on who that ""person"" was. The grand jury had accused the couple of committing the offenses ""on or between December 25 and December 26, 1996."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the indictment merely shows that a majority of the grand jurors felt there was probable cause to charge the parents -- a lower standard than proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.","'I know how difficult these decisions are,"" Stan Garnett writes .

"(CNN) -- As Spain continues its drive to slash budgets and cut spending, one of the nation's favorite pastimes -- the siesta -- is under threat as ministers look for ways to boost productivity. Three-hour lunches and catnaps, long the envy of Spain's European neighbors, could soon be a thing of the past. Last month a parliamentary commission called for the government to turn back the country's clocks by an hour and introduce regular working hours from 9am to 5pm. Read more: IMF's Lagarde warns against 'complacent' Europe . With the economy contracting and unemployment among the highest in Europe, the proposal is the latest move by the embattled Mediterranean nation to spur growth and create jobs in the wake of a four-year long eurozone debt crisis. A spokesperson for the Spanish economy ministry said the government is looking at the proposal for a time zone change and ""more rational working hours"" following the Commission's study. The move would potentially see Spain revert to Greenwich Mean Time, after Spain's long-time dictator Franco moved the country's clocks on to Central European Time to align with Nazi Germany in the 1940s. Read more: A history of defaulting on debt . Speaking with CNN, Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, said: ""For 71 years we have been on the wrong clock. We need a clock that is more convenient."" He added: ""We are also recommending a more flexible work schedule so that the days don't finish any later than 5pm and that at midday, lunch won't last any longer than roughly forty minutes."" One business that is trialling a new working day is Studio Banana, a Madrid-based design firm, where workers have found a novel way to incorporate breaks, siestas and lunch into a normal working day. Using an 'Ostrichpillow' -- a full-head pillow that allows users to sleep anywhere -- employees at Studio Banana take short power naps and return to work fresh. Ali Ganjavian, co-creator of Ostrich Pillow, said: ""It came about because we were spending a lot of time working in the studios so we thought to ourselves 'why don't we create a product that allows us to sleep anywhere.'""

The Commission's proposal to shift time zones is part of an effort to improve the country's productivity and align Spain's working hours with other European partners. But while the economic picture in Spain may look bleak, unemployment figures for the third-quarter improved slightly to 25.98% compared with 26.26% in the second three months of 2013, according to the country's National Institute of Statistics.

However, youth unemployment, which remains over 50%, still poses a major problem for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government as many young people flee abroad in search of work.

""My estimate is something like five years before figures go below 10%,"" Monteros said, ""[No one has a] magic solution."" Since the eurozone crisis began in 2009, policymakers have called on troubled nations to reform labor markets and increase flexibility, making it easier for employers to hire and fire employees. Monteros believes Spain has to become a ""business friendly"" country and argues that if the government wants the country to return to growth taxes must be reduced. ""The labor reform has been an asset,"" he said, ""because most multinational companies that compare the situation in Europe are ranking Spain as the first one in terms of flexibility and cost of labor.""

"(EW.com) -- This weekend, a Ridley Scott-directed drama starring Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, and Brad Pitt got trounced at the box office by Johnny Knoxville in an old-man costume. Yep, ""Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa"" topped the chart with an excellent $32 million in its first three days, giving Knoxville his sixth No. 1 movie after his three ""Jackass"" films, ""Men in Black II,"" and ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" Not a bad run for a guy who built his career on getting pushed into street curbs while sitting inside shopping carts! ""Bad Grandpa,"" which Paramount made on a $15 million budget, didn't feature the entire ""Jackass"" crew, but it still posted numbers in line with the rest of the irreverent prank franchise. Benedict Cumberbatch's 'The Fifth Estate' has worst debut of 2013 . While the film opened below 2010â€²s ""Jackass 3-D,"" which debuted with $50 million (boosted, in part, by 3-D ticket prices), it beat the openings of both ""Jackass: The Movie"" ($22.8 million) and ""Jackass: Number Two"" ($29 million). Audiences gave it a middling ""B"" CinemaScore grade, but if it performs similarly to its ""Jackass"" predecessors, ""Bad Grandpa"" should finish with about $70-80 million total. ""Bad Grandpa"" finally knocked ""Gravity"" out of first place, but Warner Bros' $100 million space drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney still managed a terrific hold in its fourth weekend. The film dropped just 32 percent to $20.3 million, giving it a $200.5 million total and making it Clooney's highest-grossing film ever ahead of ""Ocean's Eleven,"" which earned $183.4 million in 2001. One rung below, Tom Hanks' nautical drama ""Captain Phillips"" stayed on course in its third voyage. Sony's $55 million film sank just 28 percent to $11.8 million and $70.1 million total. After a trio of misfires in ""Larry Crowne,"" ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" and ""Cloud Atlas,"" ""Phillips"" marks a major return-to-form for Hanks. With some likely awards attention in the weeks to come, the film could sail to the $100 million mark. Casting Net: Ben Affleck to direct and star in Africa-set thriller . Down in fourth place, Ridley Scott's star-studded drama ""The Counselor"" failed out of the gate with just $8 million from 3,044 theaters. Fox spent $25 million on the film, but audiences weren't impressed by its convoluted ad campaign â€” and they weren't impressed by the final product either, slapping ""The Counselor"" with a distressing ""D"" CinemaScore grade. While ""Gravity"" and ""Captain Phillips"" have thrived in recent weeks, adult dramas like ""Don Jon,"" ""Rush,"" ""The Fifth Estate"" and now ""The Counselor"" have fallen by the wayside. After a disappointing debut, horror remake ""Carrie"" plummeted by 63 percent in its second weekend to $5.9 million, giving Screen Gems' and MGM's $30 million film an awful $26 million total. So much for Halloween appeal easing its decline during the sophomore frame. That opened the door for ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" to score one final weekend in the top five, grossing $6.1 million and pushing its total past $100 million. 1. ""Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa"" -- $32 million . 2. ""Gravity"" -- $20.3 million . 3. ""Captain Phillips"" -- $11.8 million . 4. ""The Counselor"" -- $8 million . 5. ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" -- $6.1 million . Oscar contender ""12 Years a Slave"" jumped into the top 10 after expanding from 19 to 123 theaters. The harrowing slavery drama, which earned an ""A"" CinemaScore from audiences last weekend, grossed $2.2 million, yielding a $17,480 location average this weekend and an excellent $3.4 million total after 10 days. Fox Searchlight will continue to expand the film (which was produced by Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B â€” so it wasn't all bad news for the star this weekend) in the weeks to come.

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund began the defense of their Bundesliga title with a 2-1 win over Werder Bremen at the Westfalenstadion on Friday. New signing Marco Reus opened his account for the reigning champions with a sweet strike in the 11th minute to send Jurgen Klopp's men a goal up at the break. ""I think the opening goal was really important for the team,"" said Reus, who joined from Moenchengladbach in the summer. ""I had goosebumps when I ran out and I am happy that I am now a Dortmund player,"" he added. Efforts to put the game beyond the reach of the visitors in the second half were initially repelled as Bremen goalkeeper Sebastian Mielitz palmed defender Mats Hummels' header over the bar. Other chances came and went before Bremen drew level with a headed effort of their own from defender Gebre Selassie -- who arrived from Czech champions Slovan Liberec in June -- in the 75th minute. But the home side were not to be denied as Germany international Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the winner six minutes later. The win extends Dortmund's incredible undefeated run in the league to 29 matches and they are now only seven games short of the Bundesliga record set by Hamburg in the 1982-83 season. The team's last league defeat -- a 2-1 defeat at Hanover -- came on September 18th last year. Bayern Munich's quest for a 23rd league title begins at newly-promoted Greuther Fuerth on Saturday, while last season's third-placed team, Schalke start their season on Sunday with a trip to Hanover.","Borussia Dortmund's quest for third successive title starts with a 2-1 win against Werder Bremen .

"(CNN) -- Congratulations, everyone: We've finally got rid of the Muslim Brotherhood forever. What a burden off our shoulders! Finally, we will have a Muslim Brotherhood-less Egypt. It's only a matter of days until the Muslim Brotherhood's members are rounded up in jail once again, and Egypt's normal state is restored. That normal state, where people look good without beards or veils, those ""good-looking people"" we see on TV. Egypt will finally be a free, liberal country. Good riddance, Islamists. What's that? Some Muslim Brotherhood members died at the Republican Guard headquarters? And why were they there in the first place? Aren't you glad this happened to them? Why aren't you gloating? You must be a Brotherhood supporter! You must be an enemy of the military and the state and probably work as a part-time terrorist! No. I support the demonstrations that started on June 30th and saw that former president Mohamed Morsy was unfit to be president, but that doesn't deny the fact that I believe there needs to be a thorough investigation into the events at the Republican Guard headquarters, that I'd like to know how long the Islamists' TV channels will be closed; and that I find the private media to be full of discrimination and inciting rhetoric. No, no, critics might say: you're being soft! Keep your human rights to yourself. These people can only be dealt with violently. We have to purge the country of these people. The above is a reflection of the state of mind of many who are on a ""victory high,"" or so they imagine themselves to be. The fascist nature of those people is no different than that of the Islamists who think that their enemies' disappearance off this planet would be a victory for the religion of God. But those on this victory high consider themselves to be different; they justify their fascism for the ""good of the country."" These people with their liberal values and reverence for freedom differ very little from radical preacher Khaled Abdullah, who was infamous for his favorite quote: ""May God relieve us of you and your likes (the liberals)."" I do not trust or believe the Muslim Brotherhood. We have witnessed from experience that they do not keep their word and lie time and again, as long as it serves their political agenda. They have their means of manipulating religion and justifying their actions so long as it serves their politics. Yes, the Muslim Brotherhood has done all of this and more; and for that, Morsy deserved to be protested against by the masses, and his organization deserved the abhorrence and repulsion towards them from the people. The senior Brotherhood leaders need to undergo investigation on charges of inciting violence, as well as their shady international relations. This is the legal and political course that needs to take place. I could write volumes on the lack of intelligence on the part of the Brotherhood and their corruption of both religion and politics, but that is another battle that requires different tools. We are losing this battle before it has even begun: those who claim to be freedom fighters and have been denouncing the fascism and discrimination of the Brotherhood are now contributing to the building of sympathy towards them. They are a disgrace to the principles of freedom they claim to stand for. We are returning par excellence to the atmosphere of the 90s when we settled for ""the security option"" and the media corruption and let the chests rage with a fire of hatred and allowed extremism to deepen day after day. I do believe that shutting down the Islamist channels was an important decision during a sensitive period, but I'm now calling for their return. Let them talk as they wish; it has only served to make people hate and be repulsed by them. Do not give them the chance to play the victim. What are you afraid of? Of their discriminatory media rhetoric? Or of their public political stupidity? My dear anti-Brotherhood liberal, allow me to remind you that just a few weeks ago you were desperately complaining about how grim the future looked, but now that you have been ""relieved"" of them you have become a carbon copy of their fascism and discrimination. You could respond by saying that they deserve it, that they supported the security forces and used them to overpower you, to cheat and spread rumors and widen sectarian strife. But is that really your argument? Have you made of their lowly ways a better alternative for you than abiding by the principles you have stood by for so long? They lost their moral compass a long time ago. Do you want to follow suit? Don't you see that by inciting violence towards Palestinians and Syrians you are exactly like them, when they incite violence towards the Shi'is, the Baha'is, the Christians, and the other Muslims who opposed the Brotherhood? We have replaced the ""enemies of Islam"" scarecrow with the ""enemies of the state"" scarecrow. The ideas, approaches and appearances have disappeared, and all that remains are fascism and discrimination that unite us over hatred, rather than reconcile our prejudices. Take the leaders of the Brotherhood to court and investigate the events at the Republican Guard headquarters. Ensure the autonomy of justice whether the victims are from your camp or the other's. Demand a clear framework within which all political parties are to operate, so that no party can ever spread such discriminatory, sectarian rhetoric again. Yes, the leaders of the Brotherhood must be tried just as the leaders of the National Democratic Party were tried in the case of provision of enough evidence and within the limits of the law. But remember you will never be able to erase the existence of those thousands off the face of the Earth. You will not be able arrest those thousands and their families and children, and you will not be able to prevent them from winning syndicate elections. All you're currently doing is repeating their past mistakes by turning a blind eye to those thousands, but you are only burying a living truth that will come back to hit you, or the coming generations, in the face. Kudos to those who have not allowed the ""victory high"" to rob them of their humanity; to those few who are currently isolated by everyone else and are not welcome in either camp unless they go with the current flow of hatred and gloating. Humanity has now become an isolated island among wild waves of discrimination and extremism. On this island live those isolated few, their voices fading in the midst of the roaring cries for vengeance and murder. I'm not optimistic about a population increase on that island anytime soon. But maybe in the future people will migrate to it and try to get to know this thing called humanity that we've all been stripped of. What I fear most is if a time comes when we pass by that island and cry in dismay: ""Alas, nobody lives there anymore.""

"New York (CNN) -- Alex Rodriguez's ongoing arbitration hearing into his record-setting 211-game suspension for allegedly violating Major League Baseball's drug policy is supposed to be private. But baseball fans have already gotten a taste of how far each side is willing to go to prove their case, including paying huge sums of money for evidence and -- one man who has worked for Rodriguez claims -- allegedly intimidating a witness. The man asked for his identity to be concealed out of fear of retribution from Major League Baseball. We asked him if he ever saw Rodriguez use a performance-enhancing drug. ""Never,"" he said. He claims MLB investigators pressured him to say he saw Rodriguez and other players use PEDs and that if he didn't he might not work again. ""I didn't see it, no, but I was pressured. ... A certain pressure on the part of Major League Baseball,"" he said, according to a CNN translation. The man told CNN he was not paid by baseball or Rodriguez, a three-time Most Valuable Player and one of baseball's all-time great sluggers. The man's attorney says his client was questioned for eight hours at his house. ""It was definitely Major League Baseball investigators,"" Roberto Cuan said. Rodriguez: 'I'm fighting for my life' Major League Baseball Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred strongly denied any improper conduct on behalf of his legal team. ""Our investigators have complied with all legal and ethical requirements throughout the process,"" he said. He said that included the legal purchase of evidence. Manfred confirmed authorizing $125,000 for documents to find out about violations of the league's drug policy. ""There is nothing that is illegal or unethical about paying for documents. It's sometimes necessary to pay for documents for information."" But what if those documents are stolen? Attorney: Rodriguez had 'consulting relationship' with Biogenesis . The files in question come from the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in South Florida, which MLB says supplied steroids to at least a dozen baseball players. A police report obtained by CNN shows the files were reported stolen from the car of a former Biogenesis worker. The worker told police that MLB representatives had ""offered him a job and up to $125,000 for the client files."" The last offer was March 18 and the documents were stolen six days later, according to the police report. Manfred told CNN that no one from Major League Baseball knew the documents were reported stolen. ""In fact the people we bought them from made representations to the contrary,"" he said. One of Rodriguez's attorneys, Joe Tacopina, doesn't buy it. ""Shocking. Shocking and deplorable,"" he said. ""The things that they have done, the lines that they have crossed, the laws that they have ignored, the ethical violations that have been committed by members of the legal team. It's disheartening because Major League Baseball is supposed to be the pinnacle of a sports organization in this country."" Alex Rodriguez sues Major League Baseball . Major League Baseball points out it isn't the only one paying for evidence. It was revealed during the arbitration hearing on Rodriguez's suspension that his representatives admitted paying a lot of money for ""evidentiary material."" ""We've paid far less than they've paid in this case, first and foremost,"" Tacopina said. He said his side had paid $105,000 for ""actual documentation from two witnesses"" and made a $200,000 deposit for a videotape they had yet to receive. The hearing went on hiatus two weeks ago so the arbitrator, Fredric Horowitz, could tend to other matters, It resumed Wednesday. Rodriguez was one of 14 players suspended in connection with the Biogenesis scandal and is the only one who appealed his suspension. Performance Enhancing Drugs in sports . Rodriguez, 38, is fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, just six behind Willie Mays. He would make $25 million in 2014, if his suspension is overturned. If his suspension is upheld, he won't be eligible to return until 49 games into the 2015 season. He has filed suit against MLB and retiring Commisioner Bud Selig, alleging they ""engaged in tortuous and egregious conduct with one and only one goal ... to destroy the reputation and career of Alex Rodriguez."" Tacopina said in August that Rodriguez was a consultant to Biogenenis. Opinion: How A-Rod let us down . ""Clearly there was a relationship -- a consulting relationship,"" Tacopina said. ""I mean, Biogenesis, that lab has consulted with many professional athletes. Not every single one of those athletes has been accused of or found guilty of using illegal substances."" He said Monday that Rodriguez had ""absolutely not"" taken steroids recently and MLB doesn't have any evidence that he had. However, Rodriguez has said he used drugs in the past. In 2009, Rodriguez admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs while a shortstop for the Texas Rangers between 2001 and 2003. He won the first of his MVP awards in 2003. He was traded to the New York Yankees before the 2004 season. He played 44 games this year, batting an underwhelming .244 with seven home runs after spending the first part of the season on the disabled list.

"(CNN) -- A World War II German bomber, likely the last of its kind, has been raised from the bottom of the English Channel and will be restored for display in a British museum. ""It has been lifted and is now safely on the barge and in one piece,"" Ajay Srivastava, a spokesman for RAF Museum, told the BBC. The Royal Air Force shot down the Dornier Do-17 twin-engine medium bomber of the German Luftwaffe on August 26, 1940, during the Battle of Britain. It was one of 1,500 built by Germany and the last known to be in existence, according to the RAF Museum. Germany employed more than 400 Dornier 17s during the Battle of Britain, and 200 of those were lost. Most wrecks were melted down and recycled into making planes and armaments for Britain, according to the museum. The plane raised Monday was damaged in a battle with RAF Defiant fighters as it tried to attack airfields in Essex, the museum said. Its pilot made a belly landing on Goodwin Sands in the channel off Kent, and the plane sank upside down in about 50 feet of water. The pilot and another crew member who survived the crash were taken prisoner and sent to prisoner-of-war camps in Canada, the museum said. Two other crew members died. The plane remained undisturbed on the floor of the English Channel until divers spotted it in 2008. ""The aircraft is in remarkable condition -- considering the events surrounding its loss plus the effects of spending so many years under water,"" the museum's website says. ""Other than marine concretion it is largely intact, the main undercarriage tires remain inflated and the propellers clearly show the damage inflicted during their final landing."" The museum then stepped in with a nearly million-dollar effort (about 600,000 pounds) to raise the craft and launch a restoration project. ""The discovery of the Dornier is of national and international importance. The aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the Battle of Britain. It is particularly significant because, as a bomber, it formed the heart of the Luftwaffe assault and the subsequent Blitz,"" Air Vice-Marshal Peter Dye, director general of the RAF Museum, says on the museum's website. ""The Dornier will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the Battle of Britain and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces and from many nations,"" Dye says on the website. Once the plane is ashore, it will be soaked in a citric acid solution to stop corrosion, the first step in a restoration process expected to take two years. The plane then will go on display at the RAF Museum in north London.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A plea deal has been reached in the assault case against singer Chris Brown, defense attorney Mark Geragos said in a hearing Monday. Chris Brown, at court Monday, will serve five years probation and must do jail time or community service. Brown, 20, faced charges of assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna, following a row earlier this year. Under terms of the agreement, Brown will serve five years of probation and must serve 180 days in jail or the equivalent -- about 1,400 hours -- in ""labor-oriented service,"" said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. He must also undergo a year-long domestic-violence counseling class, she said. Brown's sentence is comparable to other felony sentences when the defendant has no previous record, she said. ""This is not an easy sentence,"" Gibbons said. He must check in with a probation officer every three months. Brown had previously pleaded not guilty to felony counts of assault and making criminal threats in connection with an attack on Rihanna. But under the plea deal, he pleaded guilty to one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury in connection with the argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February.  See a timeline of events in this case » . Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, made a brief appearance at the hearing -- after Brown had left the courtroom -- to hear Los Angeles Criminal Court Judge Patricia Schnegg discuss the issuance of a ""stay away"" order requiring him to stay 100 yards from her. Through her attorney, Rihanna had requested that such an order not be issued. But Schnegg refused that request, saying she would issue such an order but would revise it to 50 yards -- 10 yards if the two are at the same ""industry event"" together. Schnegg told Rihanna, who was wearing a black dress with white pearls around her neck, that she would consider lifting the order after Brown completes his domestic violence counseling but advised Rihanna not to contact Brown. Asked whether she understood, Rihanna said she did before leaving the courtroom via a back door. Rihanna's attorney, Donald Etra, said Rihanna made the request because she felt that a protective order in place, requiring that Brown not annoy or harass her, was sufficient. Schnegg said Brown could apply to have his supervised probation transferred to Virginia, where he maintains his legal residence. He also can complete his community service there, she said, but it would have to meet the court's standards. ""I want Mr. Brown treated as any other defendant who comes to this court,"" Schnegg said. She noted, however, that he has no prior criminal record. Gibbons, of the district attorney's office, explained that the judge wants Brown to work -- remove graffiti, for instance -- as part of his service. ""His sentence is not based on what he's available to do,"" Gibbons said. ""His sentence is what he's going to do, or he's going to go to state prison for four years."" Dressed in a light plaid suit, Brown answered ""guilty"" when asked his plea by Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray. Formal sentencing was set for August 5. After the hearing, Geragos said of Brown, ""as long as I've known him in connection with this case, he's wanted to take responsibility."" He said Brown is thankful to those who offered him support and noted that he is ""a kid who's never been in trouble before"" who wants to ""move past this"" and get out the message that domestic violence is not acceptable. Brown ""embraces this as an opportunity to get his life back on track and get his career back on track,"" Geragos said, adding that Brown will speak further after his sentencing. Etra said after the hearing that Rihanna ""was fully prepared to testify and she would have told the truth about what happened that evening."" He said she did not object to the plea agreement. Rihanna had not attended any of the hearings in the case but had been following the case closely, Etra said earlier. She did not file a complaint against Brown, but the prosecution's case was built on what she told detectives and on physical evidence collected from her, including photographs of her bruised and battered face. It was not Rihanna who called police but someone who heard her screams for help, according to a sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews. The statement, filed with the court to support a search warrant for cell phone records, described a brutal attack against Rihanna, allegedly by Brown. Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna, who was riding in the sports car driven by Brown, found a text message on his cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" ""A verbal argument ensued,"" followed by the physical attack, the statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched her numerous times and put her in a head lock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to ""beat the s--t out of you"" and kill her, according to the statement, and also bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, ""Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order."" At the end of his statement, the detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. Brown also issued a public apology for the incident just days after his arrest. ""Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,"" he said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person.""

"(CNN) -- Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer won the Nobel Prize in literature, the Swedish academy that announces the annual award said Thursday. The poet beat out bookies' favorites Bob Dylan and Haruki Murakami. ""I can't do anything but cheer! Everyone here is just so happy,"" said Transtromer's spokeswoman Anna Tillgren. She said she had not been able to speak to the poet about his award yet. The academy said it gave the award to Transtromer ""because, through his condensed, translucent images, he gives us fresh access to reality."" The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa won the award last year. He is known for the novels ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,"" ""The Green House,"" ""Captain Pantoja and the Special Service"" and ""The Storyteller."" But the academy has had a tendency to pick obscure European writers over the past several years. The Literature prize went to Romanian-born German writer Herta Muller in 2009, and to the French poet Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio the year before that. Until the Le Clezio award in 2008, the prize usually went to writers with a recognized worldwide reputation, such as British playwright Harold Pinter in 2005, Colombian magical realist Gabriel Garcia Marquez in 1982, and American novelist Toni Morrison in 1993 -- the last American to win it to date. Transtromer, 80, won a lifetime award from the prestigious Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry in 2007, his website says. Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in literature 103 times. The youngest recipient was Rudyard Kipling, the author of the ""Jungle Book."" Kipling won it at age 42 in 1907. The oldest winner was Doris Lessing who was 88 when was named in 2007. On Wednesday, the prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli scientist Daniel Shechtman. Shechtman is a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and is known for his discovery of quasicrystals. On Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences named Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley; Brian P. Schmidt of Australian National University and Adam G. Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics. They made the discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the Big Bang. The Nobel committee on Monday named Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, and scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann, the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. This week, the committee also will announce the prize for peace. The prize in economics will be announced Monday.","NEW: ""I can't do anything but cheer!"" Tomas Transtromer's spokeswoman says .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Nearly 30 years after hijacking a U.S. airliner to Cuba, fugitive William Potts may soon return to the United States. Of the several dozen fugitives that U.S. authorities believe are living in Cuba, he is probably the only one fighting to go home. ""Like or lump it, I am an American, I was born there, my family was born and raised there, and that's where I have been wanting to go for over a year,"" Potts told CNN exclusively, after he met with U.S. diplomats in Havana on Monday. Potts, 56, said he submitted paperwork during his visit to the United States Interests Section in Cuba for a single-use passport that would allow him to travel back to the United States, where he probably faces arrest for the 1984 hijacking of a passenger plane to the island. Cuban newspaper alleges bribes for U.S. visas . U.S. State Department officials said they were unable to discuss Potts' case, citing privacy concerns, but they issued a statement that said, ""through our missions overseas, U.S. citizens traveling or residing overseas are accorded a full range of passport services."" At the time of the hijacking, Potts was a Black Panther with dreams of overthrowing the U.S. government. Cuba, he thought, might provide him with military training to carry out his own revolution. To get to the communist nation, he smuggled a .25-caliber pistol onto a Piedmont Airlines flight scheduled to fly from Newark, New Jersey, to Miami. After the flight took off, Potts brandished the pistol and told the pilot to fly the plane and 56 people aboard to Havana. ""I had to be forceful with him,"" Potts remembered. ""I tell him, 'If we don't go to Cuba, this plane is going down. We are going to hell or Cuba.' "" U.S. doctors see American jailed in Cuba . But Potts' dream of being embraced by Cubans as a fellow revolutionary did not pan out. Cuban authorities told him that he wouldn't receive military training and instead would be put on trial. They offered to send him back to the United States with the hijacked plane, but he chose to stay in Cuba to show he wasn't ""a play revolutionary."" After brief court proceedings, his new hosts gave him a lengthy prison sentence. ""I thought I had won the case, and they gave me 15 years,"" Potts said. ""I didn't even know what 15 was in Spanish. And they said 'quince.' I said, what is 'quince'? And my translator said 15 years. And I said, '15 years for who?' And they said, '15 years for you.' "" Cuba and U.S. talk mail cooperation . Potts served over 13 years in some of Cuba's toughest prisons and said he received regular visits from U.S. diplomats. After his release in 1997, Potts had two daughters and said being a father changed his politics. ""I am no longer a revolutionary,"" he said, ""just a father."" Potts still faces a federal indictment in Miami for the hijacking. In 2009, he wrote President Barack Obama requesting a pardon for the plane hijacking that brought him to Cuba. Hearing nothing back, he then wrote the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami to ask if a plea deal could be worked out to take into account the time he had already served in Cuba. Potts again heard no reply, but his daughters were given U.S. citizenship and passports, and last year, they left to go live with his family in the state of Georgia. Now, Potts says he would like to be reunited with his two young daughters. But, unlike other U.S. fugitives in Cuba -- some with million-dollar bounties on their heads -- his attempts to turn himself in have been met with disinterest from the United States. The U.S. State Department has placed Cuba on the list of countries that support state terrorism, along with Iran and Syria, for providing a haven for fugitives from U.S. and international justice. ""No one's harboring me,"" Potts told CNN in an interview May. ""I am trying to go back."" On Monday, he said his frustration had boiled over and he had planned a hunger strike in front of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Instead, he met with American diplomats who he said apologized for the delay in issuing his temporary passport. Potts said he may be back in the United States within a week, where he expects to be spending more time in jail. He is hopeful that the years he served in Cuba's prisons will reduce any sentence he faces back home. ""I am ready to discuss it and debate the issue in a court of law if necessary,"" he said. ""Because I am sure that any American can understand that 15 years in prison in a communist country is 15 years. It's not a Club Med situation.""

"(CNN) -- At least 35 people died and more than 100 were wounded when a spate of car bombs rocked Baghdad on Sunday, police in the Iraqi capital said. In one incident, a car bomb killed five people and wounded 11 others when it exploded at a marketplace in the predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Al-Hurriya in northwestern Baghdad, state-run TV said. Other explosions also appeared to target Shiites, but there were no further details about them. The United States said it was appalled by the attacks. ""We condemn this cowardly and reprehensible violence. We extend our condolences to the victims and their families, and hope for the swift recovery of those who were injured,"" the U.S. Embassy in Iraq said in a written statement. Also Sunday, in the predominantly Sunni city of Mosul in northern Iraq, at least nine people were killed and 14 were wounded when a bomb in a parked car exploded on a commercial street outside the al-Rafidain Bank. The blast detonated just as Iraqi soldiers were lined up to get their monthly paychecks. Soldiers were among the dead and wounded. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shiites make up a majority of Iraqis. So far in 2013, more than 6,000 people have been killed in Iraq. More than 350 of those deaths came this month, and almost 1,000 happened in September.","NEW: U.S. condemns attacks through statement from embassy in Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration warned this week that thousands of Philips automated external defibrillators (AED) might not be able to deliver a needed shock in a cardiac emergency situation. The agency said Tuesday customers should keep the defibrillators -- designed for home use and use by emergency responders -- until a replacement arrives. In 2012, Philips recalled about 700,000 of the devices, saying a problem with an internal electrical component problem could falsely indicate the AED was ready to use, according to the FDA. Last month, Philips updated its customers to say that the part failure could also cause the AEDs to be unable to deliver a shock. ""Despite current manufacturing and performance problems, the FDA considers the benefits of attempting to use an AED in a cardiac arrest emergency greater than the risk of not attempting to use the defibrillator,"" said Steve Silverman, director of the office of compliance in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA issued recommendations in a safety communication for using the devices during emergency situations and monitoring the readiness of the AED. AEDs analyze heart rhythm and deliver a shock to return the heart beat to normal. The devices were sold between 2005 and 2012 by Philips Healthcare with model names HeartStart FRx, HeartStart HS1 Home, and HeartStart HS1 OnSite. Doctors develop a heart with no pulse .

"(CNN) -- Facebook will launch a music service later this month, according to recent news coverage. Details on the new platform are scarce, but Ben Parr at Mashable reports that Facebook is partnering with top music services Spotify, MOG and Rdio to let users stream music on Facebook.com. For the uninitiated: Spotify is a service that lets you listen to virtually any song for free on your desktop, with an occasional (but infrequent) ad. Users can pay a small fee to remove the ads or use the service on their phones. That's right -- Facebook may be about to unleash unlimited free music to all its users. Music is enjoyed almost universally, and free music services have been among the fastest-growing on the web -- Napster, to name but one. Providing free music to more than 750 million people (assuming Facebook Music launches globally) seems like a no-brainer: Why wouldn't everyone in the world want to listen to and share free music with friends? This is the web equivalent of giving away free ice cream. And yet. I've been wrong on Facebook so many times before. I was wrong on Facebook Places, the social network's challenger to location-based startups. ""It's inevitable that Facebook will surpass Foursquare in the check-ins race,"" I declared more than a year ago. While I can't verify that Facebook Places didn't surpass Foursquare in terms of the check-ins it provided, Facebook no longer feels that it's viable as a stand-alone product: These location features are being merged into status updates and brand pages, the company announced recently. I was wrong, too, about Facebook Deals. In my predictions for 2011, I saw the service as a potential rival to market leader Groupon. After all, how could you provide a ""50% off"" coupon for a local business and not have a small percentage of Facebook's massive user base accept? Wrong! Facebook Deals is set to shut down in the coming weeks, with a few limited offers remaining on business pages. Meanwhile, the daily deals space is coming under fire, and even Groupon is drawing extensive criticism as it prepares for its IPO. How can Facebook take something popular, provide it free of charge to its 750 million users, and yet fail to become the market leader? Perhaps the company simply isn't able to devote the resources required to nurture so many non-core products? Or perhaps Facebook users are so focused on their news feeds that no product can take off unless it's inserted into this stream from the start.? Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: For Facebook, simply putting a product in front of hundreds of millions of people is no guarantee of success. I find it hard to imagine a situation in which Facebook users decide that free music isn't for them. Virtually all of us enjoy music. If Facebook can't make this work, then giving away ""unlimited free money"" might also prove a challenge. No, the biggest roadblock to Facebook Music won't be the users; It'll be the record companies who, having already cut deals with Spotify et al., decide to rescind the offer. Another threat: Spotify and its ilk may realize that giving away free music to millions of people isn't the most sustainable of business models. Or maybe I'm wrong again: Perhaps Facebook will fail to convince us that free ice cream is delicious. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.","Facebook is partnering with top music services Spotify, MOG and Rdio .

"(CNN) -- Easton Neston is the kind of place you'd expect to find in one of PG Wodehouse's comic novels -- a playground for England's eccentric and carefree landed gentry. Nestled among 600 acres of lush farmland and landscaped gardens, the 36-room house was built 300 years ago by architect Sir Nicholas Hawksmoor for one of the country's aristocratic families. Not only is the property one of the finest examples of English Baroque buildings, it's unusual in that it has remained a private dwelling. Indeed, the owner of this estate is no ordinary Lord of the Manor. Born Leonid Maxovitch Rodovinksi in St Petersburg, Leon Max is one of a number of Russian-born tycoons acquiring some of the UK's most iconic buildings from old families crippled by their exorbitant running costs. Max is coy about how much he paid for Easton Neston, but British publications have reported it sold for around $25 million in 2005, as its founding family were struggling to keep up with its annual $3 million maintenance bill. And while the price-tag may seem eye-wateringly expensive, Max spent almost twice as much redecorating the house. It was painstaking process, supervised by Lady Henrietta Spencer Churchill, a relative of former British Prime minister Sir Winston Churchill and the late Diana, Princess of Wales. The staff were streamlined but the ""old timers"" left are surprisingly loyal to their newfound country squire. ''What did I think of when a Russian tycoon bought this property?'' muses the copiously tweeded chief groundsman Roy Goodger, a 30-year veteran of Easton Neston. ''Strange at first. But I was happy because I knew a Russian tycoon would have money and that's what this place needs.'' Max is less optimistic about his neighbors. ''I suspect the locals had low expectations,'' he says in perfect, if soft-spoken English. Read more: Russian billionaire's Soviet-era art . ''Come to think of it they were probably expecting a shaven-headed man in a black leather overcoat with a bunch of goons toting Uzis. So, I think they were a bit disappointed when they saw me.'' A refugee from the Soviet regime, who has lived in America since the 70s, Max is actually something of an anti-oligarch. Yes, his story is one from the rag trade to the rich list but it is unconventional in that his fortune was made outside of the fast-growing emerging markets. Rather, it was in the hyper-competitive U.S. retail sector where he is best known as the man behind the Californian label Max Studio. Max clearly doesn't shy away from a challenge. When we meet he has just launched his high-end clothing line Leon Max in the UK, during one of most pronounced double dip recessions in a generation. ''Yes, Europe is in a recession but it's like everything, things will change,'' he says. ''And in the meantime, it's a wonderful place to live... to work.'' In fact, Max -- who spends only part of the year at Easton Neston -- has become so enamored with ""all things English"" that he's relocated part of his design studio to a former real tennis court in a wing designed by Sir Christopher Wren, famous for the construction of St Paul's Cathedral in London. ''I also get inspired by the country life here,'' says Max as he dons his signature white smock and weaves between seamstresses busy at their machines. Photo gallery: Russian billionaire's collection of Soviet-era art . ""In fact, we've recently launched a new line called Max Studio Country, which has everything a girl needs for a weekend in the country. Besides, it's a wonderful place for our fashion shoots.'' For his part, Max appears to have perfected the country look ''thanks to my tailor on Savile Row.'' When we meet he is looking effortlessly chic in a moss-green moleskin suit, which one can't help noticing matches much of the furniture. Although Max avoids questions about his true wealth and the value of his business, he does concede ""it's enough to keep me in good wine... and country houses.'' It also seems enough to keep him in good company as well. For when we meet the house is abuzz with preparations for the weekend's big event: A shooting party, which will attract the cream of British society. ''Shooting days are easily 5000 calorie days,'' says Max, who is trim for a man in his 50s. The day will include: A breakfast, of eggs, bacon, sausages, black pudding and bubble and squeak. Then there's elevenses with pork pie and spirits, followed by a black tie dinner, champagne, port stilton and more. ''Speaking of which, Nicholas,'' he says as he catches his trusty manservant whizzing by. ''What are we thinking of in terms of the wine? Say a Chateau Margaux 1996 to go with the lamb?'' A second later the butler scuttles back off down one of the house's endless corridors and one is left with the feeling of having met the white rabbit from Lewis Carroll's Alice and Wonderland. ''He may be British but he's spent a long time in Hollywood,'' says Max affectionately. ''He used to work for the Gettys, then he was Nicholas Cage's butler. So, I think this probably the most normal set up he's seen so far,'' he chortles. The Gettys may be famous for their massive wealth and love of art but Easton Neston itself would put many museums to shame. The interior has been so sympathetically redecorated it's hard to believe at first that Max bought the house after it had been stripped of its contents. ''Unfortunately, the family I bought it from (Lord Hesketh) had sold the contents at auction earlier,'' he says puffing on a Marlboro Light cigarette. One thing he did manage to get his hands on though, is a huge hunting scene attributed to Sir Peter Paul Rubens which hangs majestically above the fireplace in the drawing room flanked by similarly impressive works by Samuel Scott and Luca Giordano. For all the riches in the world, Max cuts a lonely -- if elegant -- figure in this former baronial hall. The twice-divorced father of one doesn't even have a dog. ""I'd love one but I travel so much,'' he says. ''They always end up being the housekeeper's dog.'' Would he like to find a ""Lady of the Manor"" one day? ''Let's just say I'm interviewing,'' Max replies with a wry -- if not shy -- smile and another drag on his cigarette. As we leave, the parlor maid is laying out the silver in preparation for an Earl who is coming to tea while outside the gamekeeper ensures the drives aren't flooded before the shooting party arrives at the weekend. Flocks of sheep graze in the distance while the odd pheasant flutters between the topiary. But then the bucolic scene is shattered by the arrival of a huge helicopter, and our host bids us goodbye.","Easton Neston is a playground for England's eccentric and carefree landed gentry .

"(CNN) -- Growing up in Lisbon, I was always pleased to tuck into the little fish pates offered as part of the entrees at my local restaurant. Little did I know, that many years later, this Portuguese staple of sardines would become one of the hooks which would lift the Iberian nation out of recession. In the second quarter of this year, Portugal's economy outperformed many other countries in the European Union with growth of 1.1%, thanks in part to its exports, which rose by more than 5%. But the export euphoria was short lived: many knew that behind those chunky fish fillets, Portugal had some economic bones to swallow. Fish canning factory Conserveira do Sul, is in many ways, an example of Portugal's economic successes and failures. For more than 30 years, this family-run business in the south of the country has fought crisis after crisis. As I get a tour of the factory, one of its co-owners, Jorge Ferreira, tells me the company has been in ""pre-alert crisis since the 1970s""-- a time when the canned fish sector went into a deep crisis and many factories closed. Read more: Europe feeling the economic winds of change . This time around however, the crisis has brought him a good economic catch. Ferreira says: ""Our products are low priced and they have been the option for many people who have had their wages reduced, so in the last few years we have observed an increase in the quantity sold of our product."" In other words, the business is faring better as the Portuguese turn to a cheaper diet. But the success of Conserveira do Sul, which produces 12 tons of fish every day, has more to thank than just its domestic market. Read more: Serbian PM: We will be next to join European Union . Chinese demand for the product, and two large distribution deals in China, have played a large part in their turnaround. ""The Chinese are looking for healthy and safe products... a safe process is very important to the Chinese market because they are very aware of contamination problems, of pollution problems"" says Ferreira. To secure these key distribution deals, Jorge tells me he shows off the factory -- the canning process, the sterilization of the product and the fresh fish itself, which arrives at the port just outside the factory door -- to Chinese distributors. It's a move that has brought work and deep sighs of relief to its employees, many of whom have been working here for years. Read more: Portugal energy boss: No need for second bailout . Maria is one of them. She has been cleaning, gutting and canning fish since she was 13. She tells me she has plenty of work. Inside the factory she cannot feel the crisis; outside however, it's a different matter. Therein lays Portugal's economic predicament. While those traditional exports of fish and olive oil offered a ray of hope in the second quarter, they were not the country's saving grace, with some arguing the numbers were simply an anomaly. The coalition government may have known that it was too early to call this a turnaround, because they did little to play off these numbers. Read more: Merkel's style over substance . Ricardo Marques, an economist at Informacao dos Mercados Financeiros, tells me over a coffee that we are ""seeing an improvement in Portugal's economy but as long as austerity is being implemented the people on the street will never feel the benefits"". There is certainly more austerity to come. The government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho has been unable to persuade the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank to ease the country's deficit target to 4.5% of GDP from the current 4% goal. As a result the government is expected to reveal a new batch of austerity measures when it announces its budget on October 15. These are expected to include more unpopular public sector job cuts, cuts to pensions and benefits and plans to raise the retirement age to 66. But this won't be easy. There is a political crisis inside the governing coalition, the Constitutional Court has ruled four times against the governments' plans to trim public sector pay and recently there were whispers of a second bailout. Read more: Mutti Merkel is no Iron Lady Thatcher . The Troika, which was visiting the country when I was there, was quick to deny the murmurs of another crisis, issuing a statement which said that Portugal's bailout program ""remains broadly on track, with the authorities determined to achieve its objectives."" There is no doubt that there's an improvement in the Portuguese economy. There are reasons to be optimistic. But let's not start popping the champagne just yet. For now, pate and bread may be the most appropriate economic aperitif.","The Portuguese government has been unable to convince creditors to ease its deficit reduction targets .

"(CNN) -- Emergency responders searched a mountainous section of Idaho Monday for a single-engine plane carrying five family members that went missing Sunday afternoon. The pilot reported engine failure at 9,000 feet at about 3 p.m. MT (5 p.m. ET) and asked the Salt Lake tower for coordinates to a remote airstrip near Cascade, a small town in central Idaho, said Lt. Dan Smith of the Valley County Sheriff's Office in Cascade. The plane dropped off the radar and all contact was lost, Smith said. The unidentified family was heading from Baker, Oregon, to Butte, Montana, in a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft. Smith said authorities used the pilot's cell phone signal to narrow the search to a two- to- four-square-mile area in the mountains. The Idaho Army National Guard is searching with two helicopters. Deputies and rescue workers also joined the search in mixed rain, snow and fairly high winds, Smith said.","Pilot reported engine failure Sunday afternoon, sought Idaho airstrip .

Yes, the Touch shoots stills at an even lower resolution than video, most likely because the wide-screen movie format is squared-off to shoot stills.

According to a press release from the police, the elder Lohan was stopped at approximately 11 p.m. Thursday when the white BMW she was driving westbound on the Northern State Parkway was observed traveling at 77 mph in a 55 mph zone. Police said Lohan, who lives in Merrick, New York, was arrested on charges of DWI and aggravated DWI after a breath test showed her blood alcohol concentration to be .20, which is more than twice the legal limit. Following being taken into custody and transported to a local police station, Lohan claimed she had been injured during her arrest. She recanted her statement after being evaluated by emergency personnel, who found no injuries. Lohan, 50, was issued traffic tickets for the two DWI offenses and speeding. She was later released to a sober third party. She is scheduled to appear in Nassau County 1st District Court on September 24 to answer to the charges.","Police said Dina Lohan was arrested Thursday night .

"(CNN) -- A broader legal challenge to Obamacare's so-called ""employer mandate"" was turned aside by the Supreme Court on Monday. The justices, without comment, again refused to intervene in Liberty University's long-running appeal of the Affordable Care Act. It marked the second time in two years the court has declined to review the constitutionality of requirements for most large employers to offer a range of health insurance coverage for their workers. Two narrowly focused petitions over the health law will be heard by the court in coming months. They involve whether some companies can refuse on religious grounds to provide insurance for certain birth control and other reproductive health services, without a co-pay. Arguments will likely be held in March and a ruling is expected by late June. In 2012, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the health law's funding mechanism, the so-called ""individual mandate"" that requires nearly all Americans to purchase health insurance or pay a financial penalty. The justices tossed out all other pending appeals at that time, but left room for continued legal challenges to certain aspects of Obamacare's application. Lynchburg, Virginia-based Liberty, which bills itself the largest Christian evangelical college in the world, refiled its lawsuit, saying its objections should be reconsidered in light of the court's 5-4 ruling affirming the overall law. It sought an exemption, believing Americans should not be required to purchase health insurance -- and employers forced to provide it -- if there are legitimate moral and religious objections to some provisions. A three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals unanimously concluded in 2011 that the suit should be blocked on jurisdictional grounds. While the Supreme Court for now will allow the employer mandate to go ahead, there are other pending lawsuits working their way through the lower federal courts, which could force an eventual constitutional showdown. The administration said last month it would delay online implementation of the employer mandate -- affecting companies with 50 or more workers -- for another year, to give those busineses more time to prepare for the new regulations and requirements. The case rejected Monday is Liberty University v. Lew (13-306).","The appeal turned aside on Monday involved the law's employer mandate .

"(CNN) -- The capture over the weekend in Tripoli, Libya, of Abu Anas al Libi, a suspected terrorist on the FBI's Most Wanted List, was clearly a triumph for the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. But was it a victory for the rule of law? While senior administration officials have portrayed it as such, the jury is still out. If the government of Libya is to be believed (and there is reason to be skeptical) the United States did not inform Libya of its plan to capture al Libi, much less ask permission. In fact, they have referred to his capture and swift removal from Libya as a ""kidnapping."" The more proper legal term for what the United States did to al Libi is a ""rendition"" -- the abduction or forced removal of someone from their home country without administrative or judicial process, followed by transfer to another country. Libya questions U.S. ambassador over al Libi capture . If done without the consent of the host government, this is indeed a violation of that nation's sovereignty, but a much less serious one than conducting a drone strike or other use of military force. As for the detained individual, there is no remedy for such a violation. According to a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case, even an illegal rendition will not prevent a properly indicted defendant from being tried in federal court. And that is where al Libi should be delivered in the near future. Even if the United States did not inform Libya of its plans, if the United States had evidence of ongoing involvement with al Qaeda, the capture of al Libi was justified under the laws of war. Importantly, both Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel expressed the propriety of the capture under the laws of war and the importance of the rule of law in conducting counterterrorism operations. According to a Defense Department statement, al Libi is being ""lawfully detained under the law of war in a secure location outside of Libya"" -- apparently a U.S. Navy warship in the Mediterranean -- where he is being interrogated. The United States appears to be following the hybrid approach to counterterrorism developed in the case of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame. Warsame, a Somalian, was captured by military forces on April 19, 2011, then held and subjected to intelligence interrogation, with no Miranda warning, for more than two months aboard a U.S. Navy ship in the Indian Ocean, before being brought to the United States to face federal criminal charges. What the terror raids say about an 'Obama Doctrine' Warsame pleaded guilty in December 2011 to nine charges and has provided extensive cooperation to federal authorities, in an effort to receive a reduced sentence. The Warsame case is an excellent example of how military, intelligence and law enforcement assets can be utilized to efficiently remove a terrorist threat from circulation in a legally supportable way while still eliciting valuable intelligence, and is a good template for the United States to follow in al Libi's case. Al Libi was indicted in 2000 for his alleged role in the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and his involvement with al Qaeda. Interestingly, al Libi was charged in the same indictment as Ahmed Ghailani. The differential treatment of these two alleged co-conspirators demonstrates how U.S. counterterrorism efforts have evolved from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. Ghailani was captured in Pakistan in July 2004. When Pakistani authorities transferred him to U.S. custody, he was not brought to New York to face the federal indictment. Rather, he was taken to a secret CIA internment camp where he was subjected to a harsh CIA interrogation regime for two years before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006. Ghailani was later charged before a military commission in Guantanamo in October 2008, just weeks before President Obama was elected. These charges were dismissed in May 2009 when Ghailani was transferred to the United States to face the federal charges. He was convicted in November 2010, 6Â½ years after his capture. Ghailani was the only Guantanamo detainee to be transferred to the United States for trial. Although Ghailani received a life sentence for his role in the African embassy bombings, some key evidence against him was suppressed by the federal district court judge because it had been acquired through coercion. This decision may have contributed to Ghailani's acquittal on all but one of the dozens of charges in the indictment. Ghailani's ""near acquittal"" played a significant role in Congress' decision to block the transfer of any further Guantanamo detainees to the United States for any reason, including prosecution in federal court. Because of this ill-advised restriction, coupled with strict conditions imposed by Congress limiting the transfer of detainees to third countries, the Obama administration has wisely opted not to bring any new terrorism suspects to Guantanamo. Opinion: Good thing U.S. terrorist hunters weren't furloughed . The president should resist calls, such as made in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, to bring al Libi to Guantanamo and try him before a military commission. Such suggestions ignore the impact of recent U.S. Court of Appeals rulings that have properly limited the charges that may be brought in military commissions, particularly for pre-2006 activity, to recognized international war crimes. Based on the offenses listed in al Libi's indictment, it is not at all clear that prosecution in a military commission is a viable option. Secretary of Defense Hagel stated that the purpose of the targeted military operations this weekend in Somalia and Libya was ""to bring international terrorists to justice."" The best chance to accomplish this is to find out what al Libi knows through humane, noncoercive interrogation, then promptly bring him to trial in federal court in New York. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frakt.","David Frakt: Seizure of Abu Anas al Libi being hailed as triumph for rule of law .

"(CNN) -- Death already has a surprisingly vivid presence online. Social media sites are full of improvised memorials and outpourings of grief for loved ones, along with the unintentional mementos the departed leave behind in comments, photo streams and blog posts. Now technology is changing death again, with tools that let you get in one last goodbye after your demise, or even more extensive communications from beyond the grave. People have long left letters for loved ones (and the rare nemesis) with estate lawyers to be delivered after death. But a new crop of startups will handle sending prewritten e-mails and posting to Facebook or Twitter once a person passes. One company is even toying with a service that tweets just like a specific person after they are gone. The field got a boost last week when the plot of a British show ""Black Mirror"" featured similar tools, inspiring an article by The Guardian. Schedule social media posts long into the future . ""It really allows you to be creative and literally extend the personality you had while alive in death,"" said James Norris, founder of DeadSocial. ""It allows you to be able to say those final goodbyes."" DeadSocial covers all the post-death social media options, scheduling public Facebook posts, tweets and even LinkedIn posts to go out after someone has died. The free service will publish the text, video or audio messages directly from that person's social media accounts, or it can send a series of scheduled messages in the future, say on an anniversary or a loved one's birthday. For now, all DeadSocial messages will be public, but the company plans to add support for private missives in the future. DeadSocial's founders consulted with end of life specialists while developing their service. They compare the final result to the physical memory boxes sometimes created by terminally ill parents for their children. The boxes are filled with sentimental objects and memorabilia they want to share. ""It's not physical, but there are unseen treasures that can be released over time,"" Norris said of the posthumous digital messages. Very loosely related: Manti Te'o and messages from a ""dead"" girlfriend . Among the early beta users, Norris observed that younger participants were more likely to make jokes around their own deaths, while people who were slightly older created messages more sincere and emotional. He's considered the potential for abuse but thinks the public nature of messages will be a deterrent. The site also requires members to pick a trusted executor, and there is a limit of six messages per week. ""I don't think that somebody would continually be negative and troll from the afterlife,"" Norris said optimistically. ""Nobody really wants to be remembered as a horrible person."" The UK-based startup will only guarantee messages scheduled for the next 100 years, but in theory you can schedule them for 400 years, should your descendants be able receive Facebook messages on their Google corneas. The company has only tested DeadSocial with a group of beta members, but it will finally launch the service for the public at the South by Southwest festival in March. Fittingly, the event will take place at the Museum of the Weird. The last, private word . For those interested in sending more personal messages -- confessions of love, apologies, ""I told you so,"" a map to buried treasure -- there's If I Die. This company will also post a public Facebook message when you die (the message goes up when at least three of your appointed trustees tell the service you've died), but it can also send out private messages to specific people over Facebook or via e-mail. Though If I Die has attracted a number of terminally ill members, the company's founders think it could be appeal to a much wider audience. ""Somebody that knows he's about to die gets time to prepare himself; the big challenge is when it happens unexpectedly,"" said Erez Rubinstein, a partner at If I Die. The Israeli site launched in 2011 and already has 200,000 users. Most have opted to leave sentimental goodbyes, and written messages are more common than videos, according the company. So far, the service is entirely free, but it plans to launch premium paid options in the future. ""It's an era where most of your life and most of your presence is digital, and you want to have some control over it. You want to be in charge of how you are perceived afterward,"" Rubinstein said. A tweet-bot to remember you by . A more extreme version of this type of control lies at the heart of _LivesOn, a new project with the catchy tag line ""When your heart stops beating, you'll keep tweeting."" Still in the early stages, _LivesOn is a Twitter tool in development at Lean Mean Fighting Machine, an advertising agency in the United Kingdom. The agency is partnering with the Queen Mary University to create Twitter accounts that post in the voice of a specific person, even after he or she has died. When people sign up, the service will monitor their Twitter habits and patterns to learn what types of content they like and, in the future, possibly even learn to mimic their syntax. The tool will collect data and start populating a shadow Twitter account with a daily tweet that the algorithm determines match the person's habits and interests. They can help train it with feedback and by favoriting tweets. ""It's meant to be like a twin,"" said Dave Bedwood, a partner at Lean Mean Fighting Machine. In the short term, Bedwood and his team said it will serve as a nice content-recommendation engine. But eventually, in the more distant future, the goal is to have Twitter accounts that can carry on tweeting in the style and voice of the original account. The people behind the project warn against expecting Twitter feeds fully powered by artificial intelligence, or worrying about Skynet, any time soon. ""People seem to think there's a button you can press, and we're going to raise all these people from the dead,"" joked Bedwood, who has seen a huge spike in interest in the project over the past week. ""People have a real faith in what technology can do."" Artificial Intelligence is still a long way from being able to simulate a specific individual, but recreating the limited slice of personality reflected in a Twitter feed is an interesting place to start. The _LivesOn service is hoping to roll out to a limited number of test users at the end of March. As with the other services, _LivesOn will require that members choose an executor. At this point, it's as much a thought experiment as an attempt to create a usable tool. A little bit of immortality . All these companies see the potential for technology to change how people think about death. Goodbye messages can help people left behind through the grieving process, but composing them can also be comforting to people who are uncomfortable with or afraid of death. ""We shy away from death. It reaches us before we approach it,"" DeadSocial's Norris said. ""We're using tech to soften the impact that death has and dehumanize it. It allows us to think about death in a more logical way and detach ourselves from it."" The prospect of artificial intelligence, even in 140-character bursts, can also be comforting to people who see it as a way to live on. ""The afterlife is not a new idea, it's been around for quite a long time with all the different versions of heaven and hell,"" Lean Mean Fighting Machine's Bedwood said. ""To me this isn't any stranger than any one of those. In fact, it might be less strange.""","New tools make it possible to schedule social media posts to go up after death .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government is being asked to update its 16-year-old cell phone radiation standard to bring it in line with current research and the way people use smartphones. A new Government Accountability Office report on Wednesday asked the Federal Communications Commission to consider updating the standard, which limits the amount of radiation a phone emits. The report recommended following an international standard, which would allow U.S. cell phones to emit up to 20% more radiation than currently allowed. The GAO also asked the FCC to consider updating its cell phone testing procedures to account for phones being used while next to the body -- such as in a pocket or held in your hand -- rather than only testing how phones emit radiation when held up to your ear. More Tech: Be careful when diagnosing your ailments online . While people still often use cell phones for talking, these devices have evolved into small portable computers and multipurpose tools. It's now common to see people using cell phones as media players kept in a pocket and used with earbuds or a wireless headset, or held in the hand while checking Facebook or getting directions from Google Maps. ""Current testing requirements for mobile phones may not identify the maximum radio frequency (RF) energy exposure when tested against the body,"" said the report. ""FCC testing requirements state that mobile phone tests should be conducted with belt-clips and holsters attached to the phone or at a predetermined distance from the body. ""By testing mobile phones only when at a distance from the body, FCC may not be identifying the maximum exposure, since some users may hold a mobile phone directly against the body while in use."" The FCC allows cell phones and other wireless devices to emit up to 1.6 watts per kilogram, averaged over 1 gram of tissue. That's the maximum specific absorption rate (SAR), a measurement of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed into the body -- information that phone manufacturers must provide to U.S. consumers. FCC developed this limit back in 1996, based on input from several federal health and safety agencies. A decade after the FCC published that standard, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a global organization that sets standards for electrical devices, published its own recommendation for a maximum SAR of 2.0. More Tech: Couples urged online to 'make a baby' Thursday . Since then the FCC's lower limit has remained in force, which complicates matters for phone manufacturers and may increase costs to consumers. The GAO noted: ""Maintaining the current U.S. limit may result in additional costs for manufacturers and impact phone design in a way that could limit performance and functionality."" To comply with the FCC's limit, some manufacturers also may have to disable features on phones sold in the U.S., according to the GAO. Some consumer groups told the GAO they don't think the info provided by federal agency websites about mobile phone health effects is sufficiently precautionary. Also, some said they'd like the FCC website to mention the World Health Organization's controversial reclassification last year of radio frequency energy exposure as ""possibly carcinogenic."" The GAO looked into the issue of revisiting cell phone radiation standards at the request of three high-ranking congressional Democrats: Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Anna Eshoo and Henry Waxman of California.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Part of a residential building collapsed in central Mumbai on Monday evening, killing four people and injuring six, and rescuers continued to search for others who might be trapped Tuesday morning, officials said. Municipal commissioner Sitaram Kunte told CNN Tuesday that four people have died and six have been rescued with injuries. He said one wing of a two- or three-story apartment building collapsed in the Mahim district of central Mumbai. ""We are estimating that three to four people are still trapped inside the building,"" he said. Fire brigades rushed to the scene, and video showed dozens of rescuers working to clear rubble. Indian media reported that the collapse happened after heavy monsoon rains. Just last week, a vacant building was being torn down in downtown Philadelphia when a four-story wall collapsed onto an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store. The incident left six people dead and 13 others injured. In April, the nine-story Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed, killing 1,130 people and injuring more than 2,400.

"(CNN) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel signed a coalition deal with the center-left German Social Democratic Party (SPD) on Wednesday, paving the way for a ""grand coalition"" of right and left. The SPD membership must still give final approval to the coalition agreement. They are expected to vote between December 6 and 12. The deal, agreed to early Wednesday, came more than two months after Germans voted in parliamentary elections and followed lengthy negotiations between Merkel's conservative bloc, her Christian Democratic Union party and the allied Christian Social Union, and its main opposition, the SPD. Speaking at a joint news conference with the leaders of the SPD and CSU, Merkel said the three main points of the deal concerned solid finances, safeguarding wealth, and social security. On the issue of solid finances, Merkel said Germany wants to see an end to debt and added that its strength relies on Europe also being strong. As for wealth, Merkel said it is important that the treaty includes no tax increases, which would help small businesses and give their workers job security. She promised investment in education and infrastructure projects, and spoke of the need to ensure Germany's future energy supply without nuclear power. Germans get minimum wage, pension boost . Despite their differences, the parties managed to reach a compromise on social security that balances flexibility and security, Merkel said. ""We went into the talks with very different ideas, and that is why it took a little while,"" she said. ""We have a good chance to say in 2017 that people will be better off than today."" Under the coalition treaty, a new nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros ($11.50) an hour will come into force starting January 2015. The 185-page treaty also includes a provision to lower the retirement age for some Germans. From July 2014, workers who have paid social security contributions for 45 years will be able to retire on a full pension at 63, two years earlier than is currently the case. If the deal is approved, as is widely expected, Merkel will be in line for a third term in office. 'Good for the country' Hermann Groehe, general secretary of Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union party, said in a statement on the party's website: ""The work is done. The coalition agreement between the CDU, CSU and SPD bears a strong conservative imprint. ""We have achieved a result that will be good for the country. Solid finances and the stability of the euro are at the heart of the agreement."" Leaving the late-night talks, SPD lawmaker Martin Schulz told CNN's German affiliate RTL he believes the treaty is ""an excellent result"" for his party. Pepe Egger, senior analyst for IHS Country Risk, said the coalition deal does not contain any major surprises but represents a compromise between current policy and the campaign pledges of the SPD. The inclusion of a minimum wage increases the likelihood that SPD members will back the deal in their postal vote next month, he said. ""Although the text of the deal vows to retain budgetary discipline and refrain from raising taxes, realization of what has been pledged is only likely to be possible in a markedly growing economy, or else it will push the budget balance back into deficit,"" Egger said. This means slow growth or a downturn may force the renegotiation of parts of the agreement, he said. The treaty ""does not depart markedly"" from current German government policy on European and eurozone issues, he added. Merkel emerged from the September elections with the CDU's biggest vote in 20 years. But the CDU and CSU did not win an outright victory, requiring them to form a coalition government. The pro-business Free Democrats, Merkel's previous coalition partner, failed to pass the 5% threshold for getting into parliament, making a grand coalition with the SPD, the CDU's chief election rival, the most likely scenario. Merkel's expected third term would give the country consistent leadership at a time when the future of the euro has come under question amid the economic problems of some euro zone members. While Germany has emerged from the crisis with its economy relatively intact, nations such as Greece have entered deep recessions while unemployment has soared. CNN's Anna Maja Rappard and Mark Thompson contributed to this report.","German chancellor's deal paves the way for a coalition of parties from the right and left .

"Dubai, UAE (CNN) -- The fact that Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airlines bought more than $150 billion worth of commercial planes on the first day of the Dubai Airshow has surprised no one, but at the same time worried just about everyone in the airline industry -- well, everyone who's not working for the Gulf airlines. The sheer number of aircraft being purchased at this year's show is outstanding, amazing and a little bit disconcerting. The headline deal is Emirate's eye-popping, jaw-dropping deals for 150 Boeing 777X airliners and 50 Airbus A380s, which comes at a time when other airlines are shunning the superjumbo. Airbus risked ending the year without any A380 sales until the Emirates' order arrived. The industry wondered whether Airbus was going to slow down the A380 production line because of a lack of orders, as Boeing has done with its 747-800 assembly line. Emirates saved the day -- which, I confidently predict, means Emirates boss Tim Clark got a very good price for his new planes, way below the $403.9 million list price. With this order Emirates is the A380 fleet, owning more than 50% of all orders of the airliner. Then there's the sheer number of Boeing 777X planes being ordered. Of the 259 planes announced at the Dubai launch of Boeing's revamped long haul aircraft, Emirates, Etihad & Qatar bought 225 of them! Poor Germany's Lufthansa snapped up 34 to be a launch customer, but no one is in any doubt: it will be the ""Gulf Three"" who will be back in the years ahead to take more by the dozen. It sends a very strong message. The Gulf Three's position as global carriers is established and will only grow stronger. Emirates are already the largest airline in the world, after the U.S. carriers, as defined by Revenue Passenger Kilometers (the number of paying passengers multiplied by the number of kilometers flown.) All those wide-bodied planes with lots of seats mean they have the capacity to shift large numbers of people. The U.S. carriers only maintain the top spots in the rankings because of their big domestic route network -- but internationally Emirates are number one and widening the gap over the competition. Take New York, where Emirates sends 2 A380s and a 777 every day to connect to their Dubai headquarters -- and there are plans to upgrade to 3 A380s as soon as possible. So why is this worrying? Capacity! All these big planes have to be filled and there is a saying in the industry -- old planes never die, they just go into someone else's fleet. Many of the planes being ordered today in Dubai will replace aging planes in existing fleets. Those older aircraft won't be scrapped; they will be sold to secondary airlines at a cheaper price, and those airlines will often slash fares to fill the seats. Capacity is the biggest killer of the industry in a downturn. It happened in 2001 where slowing demand turned the overcapacity into a crisis after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York. It happened again during the financial crises of 2008. Airlines found themselves with too many seats and too few passengers and had to mothball planes and slim down. For the moment, the industry is enjoying growth of around 5% a year -- and with new markets emerging, the strong growth in aviation is continuing in front of our eyes. The worry is what happens when that slows and who gets hurt. I guarantee you it won't be the Gulf Three. Forget arguments about subsidies, unfair competition, state-controlled airlines: Today's orders in Dubai are further evidence that the shift in aviation is happening even faster than most had believed likely. There may be much fuss made over the soon to-be-merged American Airlines & US Airways and the fight in the brutal skies of the U.S. domestic market, but globally, the Gulf Three are hoovering up the passengers. None of these points will worry the Gulf Three. Capacity issues are someone else's problem for the time being. They are sitting pretty in the sweet spot of the new-world order in aviation. They have billion dollar brand-new airport hubs, sit at the crossroads of the world's growing markets and are able to connect any two points on the globe using the dozens of wide-bodied long-haul jets they have just bought. Most important of all, the Gulf Three have their own individual strategies for growth. It's everyone else that's worried, and they should be.","Gulf airlines strike more than $150 billion in commercial plane deals in Dubai .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Police on Monday arrested the head of the defense team for the 21 women and girls sentenced for protesting in Egypt last month, a colleague and member of the defense team told CNN. Lawyer Ahmed El-Hamrawy was arrested at his home in Alexandria at dawn Monday, lawyer Mahmoud Farouq told CNN. ""I can't separate his arrest from the girls' case,"" said Farouq, who is part of the team defending the 21 jailed protesters. ""This means that any lawyer who comes close to the case will be detained."" Gen. Nasser El-Abd, the head of the Alexandria Criminal Investigation Department, told Egyptian daily newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that El-Hamrawy was arrested with five others for ""incitement of violence."" Reports: Egypt's draft constitution goes to interim president . On Wednesday, 14 women were sentenced to 11 years in prison, and seven minors to juvenile detention, on charges of gathering, thuggery and weapons possession at a demonstration for ousted President Mohamed Morsy. The harsh sentence sparked wide criticism of the way the Interior Ministry and the judiciary have been handling the cases of Morsy supporters. An appeals hearing for their case is scheduled to take place Saturday. ""We don't have any doubt that this verdict is a new episode in a series of politicized judicial rulings, which include the sentencing of several Al-Azhar students to 17 years for various misdemeanors based on accusations that are mostly trumped up and generalized,"" said a joint statement issued by 14 rights groups last week. Egyptian lawmakers begin vote on new constitution . The verdict coincided with an increasing crackdown on non-Islamist activists who oppose the military-led regime and Morsy. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah, detained during the Mubarak and the military council regimes in 2006 and 2011, is being held pending investigations for his alleged involvement in calling for a demonstration. Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6 Youth Movement, is also being questioned about similar charges. Legislation restricting demonstrations reignited confrontations between police and the non-Islamist opposition, especially at university campuses across the country. A demonstration coinciding with the retrial of two policemen accused of killing Khaled Saied, whose death had fueled the uprising in 2011, was dispersed with force in Alexandria on Monday. ""El-Hamrawy was part of Morsy's opposition. He demonstrated against him on June 30, but he's been involved in defending freedoms since July 3,"" when the military removed the Islamist President from power, Farouq told CNN.

"(CNN) -- ""Get over there, girl, can't you read? Stand in this line,"" the customs agent, armed with a machine gun, barked at me while pointing her finger in my face. The female Afrikaans custom agent was apparently upset that I wasn't moving along quickly enough. It was clear that she didn't like the looks of me because she refused to look me in the eye or answer my questions about where to go next. ""Girl, who does she think she is talking to?"" I asked my travel companion who was white and male. ""I don't have to take that kind of rudeness from anyone."" But he begged me to keep my opinions to myself before I got arrested or worse. You see, it was 1992 and I had just landed in South Africa. And while Nelson Mandela may have been freed from prison in 1990 after 27 years, and the system of racial separation of apartheid was beginning to be dismantled with the opening of beaches and other public places by then-President F. W. De Klerk, the reality was that black people had a long way to go. Black Africans were not treated with any type of dignity or equality. The customs agent was holding on to the old ways and she made it clear. Back home while studying at Penn State, I'd adorned myself head to toe in the colors of the African National Congress (black, green and gold) and joined the student protests against apartheid. We demanded that the university divest its holdings from all corporations that were doing business in South Africa, companies like IBM, General Motors and Coca-Cola. Students of all races and backgrounds around the world had joined the anti-apartheid movement. Shantytowns were erected, hunger strikes were begun and for the first time in my young life, I began to think about my generation's collective power to force change. ""Divest Now. Free Nelson Mandela!"" were our battle cries back then. Honestly, I didn't really know much about South Africa and had just begun to learn about Nelson Mandela, who is revered today but was rarely mentioned in a favorable light back then. The story of his nation was never taught in any of my world history classes. After reading about his life and studying the history of South Africa, ""Madiba"" became a hero and symbol of freedom for me and many of my generation. We were hungry for a courageous leader of our own, a civil rights movement of our own and a way to contribute our voices to the fight for freedom against the greedy, consumer-driven politics of the 1980s. Armed with a journalism degree and a desire to eradicate injustice, I set out to change the world. But I soon found out that it was naÃ¯ve to set such a lofty goal, considering I didn't truly understand anything about the world except what I'd read in the newspapers. And I admit, protesting in the safe confines of elite college campuses isn't exactly radical. My African friends, who appreciated my good intentions, challenged me to dig deeper to understand their world. It was not enough, they said, to don the colors of the ANC and wave protest signs and rant against the headlines. ""If you really want to know our country and our struggle, go see it for yourself. Meet our people, live in our townships, not a fake Shantytown, and learn about the rich, vibrant culture of South Africa."" And that's exactly what I did, much to the chagrin of my family, who feared that I might be killed in a protest, catch a horrible disease, or worse -- get trampled by an elephant. We were not a worldly family back then. For me, traveling to South Africa in the early 1990s before apartheid was fully dismantled was an eye-opening experience. The country at the time was a paradox of extremes -- a stunningly beautiful nation with an overabundance of natural resources. But the wealth that was generated was only benefiting the whites while the specter of civil war loomed. The white people were anxious and hostile at the quickly changing balance of power and threatened to flee the country, taking their wealth and corporations with them. Black Africans were hopeful after the release of Mandela but frustrated with what they saw as the slow pace of change. The chains of apartheid were still a very big part of their everyday lives. For me, living there in the townships with families -- both wealthy and poor -- of my South African friends changed my life and my perception of who I was as a black woman, and as a citizen of the world who had a responsibility to stand up to injustice. By experiencing their lives up close, I learned how much we had in common -- shared traditions and family stories, a deep love of music and even many family recipes. I was strengthened by the connection between my African ancestors and my American relatives; they had the strength to survive against extreme oppression and the ingenuity and intelligence to prosper. In South Africa, I met courageous journalists who had risked their lives and lived in daily fear because they dared to speak out against apartheid. They taught me more about journalism ethics and reporting than any college course could. And I met loving mothers and young women and men who refused to let generations of oppression crush their determination to fight for freedom, or their joy for the small blessings in life. And I learned that though there are times when the best battle strategy is take up arms to fight your enemies, it is wiser in the long run to show grace in the face of hatred. Above all, Mandela showed the world that we can never be completely free until we free ourselves of hatred. When Mandela was elected president in 1994, I wept with happiness for my newly found brothers and sisters. But I was also envious that their nation had come so far and united together to accomplish what I could never imagine in my lifetime in the U.S. -- a black president. (Well, I wrong on that one.) So I say goodbye to Madiba and celebrate his life with the joyous lyrics of ""Black President"" by Brenda Fassie, a nationwide hit that I first heard in South Africa at a celebration party after Mandela's election. We danced out hearts out that night for our first black President, singing: . ""Let us rejoice for our President. Let us sing for our president. Let us pray for our president. Let us sing, let us dance. For Madiba, Madiba's freedom.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- An arrest warrant for murder has been issued for the ex-husband of a former swimsuit model whose nude body was found over the weekend, Orange County police said Thursday. An arrest warrant has been issued for Ryan Alexander Jenkins, wanted in the death of ex-wife Jasmine Fiore. The body of Jasmine Fiore, 28, was found Saturday stuffed into a suitcase inside a Dumpster behind an apartment complex in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim in Orange County. Her teeth had been extracted and her fingers removed. Fiore lived in Los Angeles and was last seen alive Friday in San Diego at a poker game with her ex-husband, Ryan Alexander Jenkins, a reality TV contestant. ""We believe he has crossed into Canada,"" U.S. Marshals Chief Inspector Thomas Hession told reporters. ""He needs to understand that he is now officially wanted. We won't stop looking for him.""  Watch why cops are looking to Canada » . Prosecutors requested bail be set at $10 million. Wednesday night, officers from the Blaine Police Department in northern Washington recovered a black 2003 BMW X5 SUV outfitted with a boat trailer and a boat belonging to Jenkins in Point Roberts, just south of the Canadian border, said Buena Park, California, Chief of Police Tom Monson. ""It's now our belief that he has now crossed the border on foot,"" he said, adding that authorities were working with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to find him. Monson appealed to the public for help in locating a white 2007 Mercedes Benz CLS550 with paper license tags also linked to the suspect. Hession cautioned anyone who might be considering helping the suspect flee that doing so would leave them open to charges of aiding and abetting a fugitive. ""Ryan Jenkins is an animal,"" said Robert Hasman, a family friend who said Fiore had been his girlfriend for 2 1/2 years.  Watch Hasman speak out » . ""What he has done to Jasmine is unspeakable. It's just not right."" He described her as ""a beautiful person who was a very caring individual and a lot of the information that you are seeing in the news is not true."" He would not specify to what he was referring. Buena Park Police Lt. Steve Holliday said Fiore's fingers and teeth had been removed. Asked whether that was done to keep her body from being identified, he said, ""It can be inferred that way."" ""It appears to be a gruesome attempt to conceal her identity,"" concurred Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas in an interview with CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Jenkins is the sole suspect in the killing, authorities said. ""There is no indication that anybody else might be involved,"" he said. Jenkins is believed to be armed, Rackauckas said. ""There's a handgun missing from his apartment, which is the last place he was before he fled,"" he said. Jenkins matched the description of a man seen driving a boat Wednesday in Blaine Marina off northwest Washington, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said. Blaine, Washington, borders Canada. Authorities searched the area and found Jenkins' black SUV with an empty boat trailer at the Blaine Marina, police said. Jenkins reported Fiore missing Saturday night to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, authorities said. The body was identified as Fiore on Monday. While the cause of death has not been confirmed, a preliminary coroner's report indicates she was strangled. Jenkins and Fiore reportedly had been married a few weeks before getting the union annulled. According to court records in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jenkins was charged in June with battery for allegedly striking Fiore in the arm with his fist. And in 2007, Jenkins pleaded guilty in Calgary, Alberta,  to assault in a separate case. He was sentenced to 15 months probation, ordered to undergo counseling for domestic violence and sex addiction and to stay away from the person involved, according to court records. Jenkins, who appeared on VH1 shows, ""Megan Wants a Millionaire"" and ""I Love Money 3,"" is from Calgary. 51 Minds, the production company of ""Megan Wants a Millionaire,"" said Thursday in a written statement that it ""was not aware of Ryan Jenkins' record when it cast him. ""The company did have in place what it thought was a thorough vetting process that involved complete background checks by an outside company for all contestants on its shows,"" it said. ""Clearly, the process did not work properly in this case. 51 Minds is investigating what went wrong and taking steps to ensure that this sort of lapse never occurs again."" In a statement, VH1 said it has postponed any airings of ""Megan Wants a Millionaire"" because of the ""tragic situation.""","Body of Jasmine Fiore, 28, found Saturday stuffed into a suitcase inside a Dumpster .

"(CNN) -- Gonzalo Higuain scored his first Serie A goals since October as third-placed Napoli earned a morale-boosting 4-2 win at Lazio on Monday. Higuain has struggled to match his feats at Real Madrid since joining from the Spanish club in a reported $55 million deal in July, but he netted in each half to put the Naples side within three points of second-placed Roma and six of leader Juventus. The Argentina striker put Napoli ahead in the 24th minute at Rome's Stadio Olimpico but an own-goal from teammate Valon Behrami less than 60 seconds later leveled the score. Fellow forward Goran Pandev made it 2-1 five minutes after the break, and Higuain -- who also had a first-half effort disallowed for offside -- extended the lead in the 72nd minute with his seventh goal in Italy's top flight this season. Striker Keita Balde Diao pulled one back on 88, but Higuain's fellow former Real star Jose Maria Callejon sealed the win with his seventh goal in the league. It helped boost Napoli ahead of this weekend's home match against Udinese and next week's must-win European Champions League Group F clash with Arsenal. The defeat left Lazio in ninth place, 20 points behind champion Juve. The Turin side suffered a setback Monday with the news that key midfielder Andrea Pirlo will next week's Champions League Group B decider at Galatasaray after suffering a knee injury in Sunday's 1-0 win against Udinese. Juve needs a point to qualify for the knockout stage in second place behind Real Madrid. Meanwhile, Fiorentina stayed fifth in Serie A after Monday's 4-2 win at home to 10-man Verona, with the score 2-2 inside 15 minutes. Borja Valero netted two of those to level for La Viola, who then went ahead through Juan Vargas just before halftime. Verona had Serbia midfielder Bosko Jankovic sent off in the 54th minute, allowing Giuseppe Rossi to net his leading 12th goal in 14 league games, while Brazil-born Italy Under-21 international Jorginho ensured a nervous finish when he reduced the deficit on 72. It left Fiorentina behind fourth-placed Inter Milan on goal difference, with Verona five points adrift in sixth.","Napoli six points behind Italian league leader Juventus after beating Lazio 4-2 .

"(CNN) -- Three people were killed and a fourth was wounded in a shooting Friday at a lumber company in North Carolina, a county sheriff said. Investigators later found a man witnesses identified as the shooter in his home with a gunshot wound to the head, said Sheriff Dempsey Owens of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. Both the fourth victim and the alleged shooter were in critical condition, Owens said. The shooting happened at the McBride Lumber Co., about a mile north of Star, North Carolina, about 50 miles south of Greensboro, Owens said. All five individuals worked at the company, Owens noted. Investigators summoned to the business around 6:15 a.m. found four people inside who had been shot. Three were dead. A fourth was flown by helicopter to a hospital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the sheriff said. Witnesses identified the shooter as 50-year-old Ronald Dean Davis. Law enforcement officers who went to his home discovered him sitting on a couch with a gunshot wound and a rambling six-page note beside him, Owens said. Owens said there's a ""possibility"" Davis was being harassed at work, though he stressed that investigators had not yet identified a motive. Davis, also hospitalized at the university facility, ""knew who he went after,"" Owens said.

"(CNN) -- In describing one's relationship status, Facebook offers the option: ""It's complicated."" This sums up the relationship between Hispanic voters and the political parties. On the one hand, Hispanics are overwhelmingly more likely to connect with Democrats than with Republicans -- by nearly a 3-to-1 margin. A new survey released by the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit Washington-based research group, found that 56% of registered Hispanic voters identified with Democrats, 19% identified with Republicans, and 19% with Independents. In the survey, more than 6 in 10 Hispanics said they felt close to the Democratic Party, while only 3 in 10 said that about the Republican Party. When Hispanics were asked to describe the parties, 48% of the responses about Republicans were negative words like ""intolerant"" or ""out of touch,"" while just 22% of the responses about Democrats were negative. In the 20th century, the Democratic Party was home to working-class ethnic groups (Polish, Irish, Italian, etc.) who saw Republicans as the party of the rich. Today, it is the go-to place for Latinos who feel picked on by the GOP. Yet for Republicans, all is not lost. Hispanic voters have demonstrated they can think for themselves. When choosing candidates, they will often put the person before the party. And so they've been known to throw their support behind Republicans who take moderate stances on immigration and eschew the GOP's tendency to turn the already contentious debate into an ugly culture war where immigrants are often portrayed as inferior to the native-born. It worked for President Ronald Reagan and former Sen. John Tower of Texas, both of whom took Hispanic outreach seriously and invested the resources to attract Hispanic support. Other Republicans who, at various times in their careers, earned substantial Latino support -- i.e., more than 30% of the vote -- include Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and, of course, former President George W. Bush. Most Latinos don't change their political affiliation. They're notoriously brand loyal. Even when they flirt with a Republican candidate, they go home to the Democratic Party. President Obama got an impressive 71% of the Latino vote in the 2012 election. But even that part of the story is complicated. In August, a Gallup Poll found that -- when one looks at Obama's job approval rating -- there is a huge swing, among Latinos, from one quarter to the next. Obama's support among Latinos is a mile wide and an inch deep. One thing you hear a lot of in Latino circles is that many of these voters, in picking Obama over Republican challenger Mitt Romney, chose the ""lesser of two evils."" In a recent interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Romney said the biggest strategic error of his campaign was ""not investing sufficiently, particularly in Hispanic TV and Hispanic outreach to help Hispanic voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity."" He also insisted that his message didn't get out. ""I think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the Hispanic community,"" Romney said. I think Hispanics understood what Romney was selling. They just weren't buying. Be that as it may, now that Romney is not in the picture, many Latinos are not shy about expressing their view that Obama hasn't been in their corner, and nor are they on his radar. Latino voters can really shake things up if the Republican candidate is smart about pursuing them. According to polls, the number of Latinos who identify themselves as being on the far left is quite small. In an August 2012 survey, the Pew Hispanic Center found that only 30% of Hispanics consider themselves ""liberal"" while 63% chose either ""moderate"" or ""conservative."" Yet, one area where neither party has been very smart is with regard to the critical issue of immigration. One reason that Latinos are increasingly ambivalent about Obama and the Democrats is that, under this administration, the number of deportations of undocumented immigrants is on track to reach 2 million in 2014. Meanwhile, many Republicans remain stubbornly opposed to giving the undocumented an earned pathway to legal status and pander to nativists by stirring up anxiety over the country's changing demographics. It's true that Latinos care about other issues more than immigration. In fact, the top three issues of concern for Latino voters are usually jobs/the economy, education and health care. But immigration is also a defining issue, a litmus test that tells them whether they can trust a given candidate or a party to deal with them fairly and honestly when it comes to other issues. Those issues now include the government shutdown over Obamacare. Although both parties are very clearly at fault, polls show that most of the blame for this debacle is going to Republicans. A majority of Latinos support Obamacare, so they're not going to look fondly on the GOP for gumming up the works to protest a program that Latinos support anyway. It's a little early to tell what the fallout will be but it might be that the shutdown only serves to further tarnish the Republican brand in the Latino community. The GOP was already in a hole with Latino voters, and it may have just gotten a little deeper. Still, it's also entirely possible that Latinos will wind up doing on the shutdown what they're doing on the stalemate over immigration reform and spread the blame to both parties. No matter how daunting the challenge, Republicans mustn't give up on attracting Latino support. Stranger things have happened. But they need to change their game plan, holster the intolerance, and start approaching those voters with something that they're not getting much of from either party: honesty and respect. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","A survey shows that Hispanics connect more with Democrats than Republicans .

"(CNN) -- The studio behind the female buddy flick ""The Heat"" is probably hoping the movie will be huge. But there is some controversy overseas about something connected to the film that doesn't appear to be as big. The Daily Mail reports that promotional posters for the film, which stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, appear to have been altered to slim McCarthy's face. The story notes that the U.S. version of the poster also sports McCarthy with a digitally slimmer face. The poster shows McCarthy in character as a police detective and her face appears less round. McCarthy's neck in the poster also appears slimmer than in real life. Representatives for the film declined to comment to CNN on speculation that Melissa McCarthy's face and neck appear to have been Photoshopped. British site The Shiznit put up a representation of what the poster would look like using an unaltered photo of McCarthy. ""This is one of the worst Photoshop jobs I have ever seen, but it's not just offensively bad craftsmanship -- the intention behind it is downright nasty,"" the site's editor, Ali Gray, wrote. It's not the first time the plus-sized actress -- who has found fame as a co-star in the hit film ""Bridesmaids"" and the CBS television show ""Mike & Molly"" -- has been at the center of controversy regarding her weight. In 2010, Marie Claire writer Maura Kelly faced a firestorm of criticism when she wrote a piece titled ""Should 'Fatties' Get A Room? (Even on TV?)"" in which she wrote ""I think I'd be grossed out if I had to watch two characters with rolls and rolls of fat kissing each other ... because I'd be grossed out if I had to watch them doing anything."" Kelly's piece, which was inspired by a CNN article ""Weight is a big deal for TV, movie characters,"" led to thousands of complaints from Marie Claire website readers. Kelly later apologized. Last year New York Observer film critic Rex Reed referred to McCarthy as a ""female hippo"" while panning her film ""Identity Thief,"" which co-starred Jason Bateman. Reed later defended his remarks and said the controversy helped the film sell more tickets on its opening weekend. ""I have too many friends that have died of obesity-related illnesses, heart problems and diabetes. ... I have helped people try to lose weight, and I don't find this to be the subject of a lot of humor,"" Reed told WOR-AM radio in New York. In 2011 the actress responded to comments about her weight. ""Do I sometimes hope I wake up in the morning and people are like, 'What's wrong with her? She looks emaciated.' Of course I would love that,"" McCarthy said. ""I'm such a clothes whore I would love the opportunity to be a hanger. But I think I'm more confident than I've ever felt in my life. I always thought it was worth the fight. Now I know it is."" ""The Heat"" will be released in the United States on June 28.","Promotional posters from McCarthy's 'The Heat' look different .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has upped the temperature on its neighbors, warning in a new threat that it would not give any advance notice before attacking South Korea. ""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,"" Pyongyang said in a statement published Tuesday by its official news agency, KCNA. North Korea said it was responding to what it called insults from the ""puppet authorities"" in the South, claiming that there had been a rally against North Korea in Seoul. It called the rally a ""monstrous criminal act."" The renewed threats came a day after North Koreans celebrated the birthday of their country's founder, Kim Il Sung, who launched the Korean War. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged the regime in Pyongyang to ditch its nuclear program and put a lid on its fiery rhetoric if it wants to hold talks. ""The United States has made clear many times what the conditions are for our entering talks and they haven't changed,"" Kerry said during an interview with CNN's Jill Dougherty in Tokyo. ""The conditions have to be met where the North has to move towards denuclearization, indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats, stop the testing, and indicate it's actually prepared to negotiate,"" he said. Kerry was speaking at the end of a three-day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from South Korea, China and Japan to try to persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table and renounce nuclear weapons. His visit followed weeks of dramatic threats by Kim Jong Un's regime, including that of a nuclear strike on the United States and South Korea. The White House announced Monday that South Korean President Park Geun-hye will visit President Barack Obama in Washington on May 7. ""President Park's visit underscores the importance of the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia Pacific region, and of the central role of alliances in the President's Asia-Pacific rebalancing effort,"" the White House said in a statement. There is uncertainty about how advanced the North's nuclear weapons program is, but Kerry on Monday reiterated the U.S. government view that Pyongyang doesn't yet have the capacity to carry out a nuclear attack. Last month, North Korea scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It also recently pledged to restart a reactor at its main nuclear complex that had been shut down under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks with the United States, South Korea and four other countries. Kerry said Monday that the United States is concerned that North Korea's dogged pursuit of its nuclear weapons program could have consequences elsewhere in the world. ""It is the belief of President Obama, myself and the administration that what happens here also has an impact on perceptions in places like Iran, the Middle East, and elsewhere where we're engaged in nonproliferation efforts,"" he said. Pyongyang insists that its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the United States and its allies. Multilateral talks on North Korea's nuclear program have ended in failure in the past, and Kerry said the United States isn't interested in going over old ground. ""We're not going to go through another cycle of artificial negotiations that are geared to simply attract some kind of aid or lull in events while they continue to pursue their devices' designs,"" he said. A U.S. State Department official said Monday there are no plans to move toward direct talks, ""because North Korea has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction."" Pyongyang on Sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue, one by South Korea last week regarding the North's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate. A statement via KCNA, the state-run news agency, called the South's offer a ""crafty trick"" and ""empty words without any content."" And a KCNA commentary Monday was titled, ""U.S. is to blame for escalating tension on Korean Peninsula."" Kerry's trip finishes on one of the biggest dates on the North Korean calendar: ""The Day of the Sun,"" when citizens celebrate the birthday of Kim Il Sung, remembered as the ""eternal president."" He died in 1994 and would have been 101 this year. Current leader Kim Jong Un paid tribute Monday to Kim Il Sung, his grandfather, as well as his late father, Kim Jong Il, by visiting the halls where both men lie in state. It was believed to be the young leader's first public appearance in two weeks. Suspicions remain that the North could carry out a test of a mobile ballistic missile at any time. Kerry said in Beijing at the weekend that the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches. Pyongyang made good on its promise to launch a long-range rocket around the time of Kim Il Sung's birthday last year; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea. North Korea has made more threats since then. It launched a rocket in December that apparently put a satellite into orbit, and in response, the U.N. Security Council approved broadening sanctions against the country. Angered by those sanctions, Pyongyang announced in January it was planning its third nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part what it called a new phase of confrontation with the United States. It carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in February, resulting in even tougher sanctions. Those measures, along with joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises in South Korea, prompted an intensification in the North's threats. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Esprit Smith, Elizabeth Joseph and Tim Schwarz contributed to this report.","North Korea says it would not give notice before attacking South Korea .

"(CNN) -- California regulators recommended a record $2.25 billion fine for the state's largest utility Monday in the gas pipeline explosion that killed eight people in a San Francisco suburb. If approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, the proposed fine for Pacific Gas and Electric would be the largest ever imposed by a state regulator. Jack Hagan, the head of the agency's safety and enforcement decision, said ""every penny"" should go toward safety improvements. ""There is no amount of money that will bring back the eight people who tragically lost their lives in the pipeline blast or heal the lasting wounds to the people of San Bruno,"" Hagan said in a statement announcing the decision. ""All we can do is make sure such a tragedy does not happen again."" The September 2010 explosion destroyed 38 homes and left a 72-foot by 26-foot crater in the middle of a neighborhood in San Bruno, near San Francisco International Airport. Federal investigators found the pipeline at the heart of the blast was inadequate even when installed in 1956. There was no immediate reaction to the announcement from PG&E, which accepted responsibility for the explosion in December 2011. The company has until May 24 to file a response to the recommendation, and the commission says it expects to decide on the penalty in late summer. PG&E has said it invested more than $1 billion in safety upgrades on the pipeline since the disaster, and that money would be applied to the proposed fine, the commission said. The company would be required to spend shareholder funds on the improvements without seeking additional money from customers, the commission said. In addition, PG&E would be subjected to audits to make sure it's not shifting money from other operations ""that affect safety."" The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the disaster, found that a faulty pipe, flawed operations and inadequate government oversight led to the explosion. NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said the probe yielded ""troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight, and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety."" ""It was not a question of if this pipeline would burst,"" she said. ""It was a question of when.""

"(CNN) -- Scores of people who had been without bread for days were killed when Syrian warplanes bombed a bakery in the western village of Halfaya, opposition activists said Sunday. More than 100 people were killed, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The death toll could rise, the activist group said. An activist who oversaw the burial of many bodies said at least 109 people died. Hassan Al-Rajb told CNN that 69 people were identified and buried, while 15 others were laid to rest without being ID'd. At least 25 more bodies were still at the site, but hospital workers said the roads were cut off and they were unable to reach the bakery, he said. The hospitals cannot handle all the wounded, he said. An LCC activist told CNN he went to the scene. ""There were dozens of dead thrown in the street. The residents were shocked and in a state of fear. It was chaotic,"" Mahmoud Alawy said. Videos posted on social media purported to show the aftermath of the attack. Many bodies had limbs apparently blown off, and others lay bloody in the streets and in rubble strewn over a sidewalk. Uniformed Free Syrian Army soldiers and civilians scramble to pull survivors out of the carnage. CNN cannot independently confirm government or opposition reports out of Syria, as the government has restricted access by journalists. The town has lacked the ingredients for bread for about a week until an aid group delivered provisions Saturday, Alawy said. Hundreds of people lined up at the bakery on Sunday. Al-Rajb said the town has three bakeries, and one opened at 1 p.m. Workers began to distribute the bread two hours later. He was on his roof about 200 meters (about 219 yards) from the bakery about 4 p.m. and saw a plane overhead. He scrambled toward the scene when he heard cries of ""Emergency! Emergency!"" he said. ""The first floor collapsed on the second floor, and four rockets were fired into it,"" he said of the attack. Alawy claimed the government has been targeting large gatherings of people with artillery shells in the recent days since the Free Syrian Army liberated the town from Syrian forces. About an hour after the bakery attack, 15 shells were fired into Halfaya from a nearby town, Al-Rajb said. The Hama Revolution Command Council, a network of activists affiliated with the FSA in Hama province, said a MiG warplane bombed the bakery. Many Syrians face food shortages and other needs as winter weather sets in. The United Nations estimates that more than 2.5 million need humanitarian assistance.

"Isle de la Gonave, Haiti (CNN)  -- The fishing boat speeds over blue waters of the Caribbean, leaving behind the devastation of mainland Haiti. Pods of dolphins and flying fish dart over the frothy waves. Ahead lies an island of pristine beaches. But reality on the Haitian island, about 45 miles off the main island, is far from a tropical paradise. Neglected by the government for years, the residents of Isle de la Gonave call their island ""the forgotten Haiti."" Now more than ever. The earth didn't rumble as hard in la Gonave on January 12, but people are feeling a different sort of aftershock. ""This whole island was sourced by Port-au-Prince,"" says Capt. Stan Bednair, who has come in on this warm, humid Tuesday with a team from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit to assess the situation at Anse-a-Galets, the biggest community on the island. ""The main source of income here is cash from the mainland,"" he says. ""Now it is not flowing."" Without much agriculture on the rugged, limestone island, people seek all their provisions -- including food -- by boat from the Haitian capital and coastal cities such as Leogane that were leveled in the killer quake. ""We don't produce anything here. Just fish,"" says Bernard Ranfort, who does odd manual labor jobs to earn a few dollars. After the quake, he says, prices skyrocketed.

La Gonave is one of the poorest regions of Haiti, the most destitute country in the Americas, where the per capita income is less than $400 and 80 percent of people are living under the poverty line. Bednair says the quake is a severe blow to this impoverished and isolated community. ""There is a very strong secondary effect in la Gonave."" Some of that is evident at the hospital in Anse-a-Galets. Jean Donaldson's mother has brought him here so that the Americans can help him. The 9-year-old boy broke his right leg when a wall crumbled in November. He had pins placed in his leg in Port-au-Prince. They were supposed to have been removed the day before the quake. The boy is rushed in and placed on a gurney in a gaudily painted turquoise examination room that was sparse in the morning but by midday is teeming with the U.S. Navy's world-class medicines and expert doctors. Lt. Kishla Askins suggests taking the boy back to the USS Nassau for further treatment. Jean's mother puts a fresh shirt on him for the journey. Askins continues down the long line of patients, all of whom are expecting some of her short time here. Full coverage . They are suffering from acute injuries, both quake-related and not, and chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. ""They just don't have that access to care,"" Askins says. ""They don't have specialists here or anything like x-rays to internal medicine, any kind of surgery. They were relying on Port-au-Prince, and they have lost that."" The Marines carry the crippled boy to a Humvee and journey down the main route through Anse-a-Galets: Avenue of Evolution. Despite the name, time seems to have stood still in this town of limestone huts and a few dilapidated or half-finished buildings. Layers of dust cover everything, as though the quake had struck violently here. The only signs of modern civilization are the two cell towers owned by Digicel and Voila and a series of hand-painted green street signs, an odd site in a place where vehicles are lacking license plates. A sudden burst of magenta bougainvilleas catches the eye amid the drab. At the beach, crowds have amassed to watch the Americans who came to help. Joinvill Anvousse is one of them. He, like many other young people from la Gonave, left his birthplace several years ago to seek education in Port-au-Prince. He was studying theology at the Haitian Bible College. Finding shelter, aid, supplies . On the day of the quake, he escaped with his sister. His house and his college, he says, were destroyed. Afraid of the sizeable aftershocks that continued to jolt the city, afraid of the death all around him, Anvousse took a boat back to la Gonave. He says he doesn't know where his parents are. Nor his other seven siblings. He meanders through Anse-a-Galets in hopes of finding people who will provide him something to eat. He counts back the days to Sunday, trying to recall when he last had a meal. ""Rice,"" he says. ""And then some water. If you go to the water pipe, you can find some water. ""Some of my family is dead. The rest are very poor right now. My education is breaking down. It was everything to me."" He doesn't even have the money to return to Port-au-Prince to find loved ones. The boat rides cost anywhere from $6 to $8, depending on whether it's on a sailboat or a motorized one. Under the glare of the afternoon sun, Anvousse gazes intently as the Marines load up their trucks and gear onto a monstrous landing craft utility boat that carried them to shore earlier in the day. Residents watch in awe as though an alien spacecraft had landed from outer space. Some have never even seen a television camera, let alone a state-of-the-art utility boat that comes by sea and travels on land, kicking up sand and gravel like a hurricane would. ""The government of Haiti is breaking down,"" Anvousse says, his eyes set on the departing Marines. ""The only thing we can do now is wait for the USA."" Then the Marines, who came with food and medicine, head for the sea. They don't see the sign at the tiny port.

"(CNN) -- Samsung on Monday announced a ""premiere"" event set for next month in London, along with a set of cryptic images suggesting new devices for its Galaxy and Windows-based lines. The event is set for Thursday, June 20, at the Earls Court exhibition center in London. The announcement specifically mentions the Korean electronics maker's Galaxy and ATIV lines. Galaxy is the company's trademark line of Android-based mobile products -- chief among them the Galaxy S4 smartphone, which has emerged as the chief rival to Apple's iPhone. It also includes the Galaxy Tab tablets and the Galaxy Note phone. ATIV is the company's lesser-known Windows line. The line includes tablets and laptops, but with a focus on mobile, the event could include the launch of a new smartphone running Microsoft's operating system. Samsung's ATIV S phone was unveiled last year and was one of the first devices designed to run the Windows 8 operating system. Its hardware is similar to the popular Galaxy S III, but the phone failed to make much of an impression on buyers. So far, only Nokia has had much luck capturing sales in the relatively slender portion of the smartphone market owned by Microsoft. (But analysts say Windows Phone devices have moved into third place in the market, passing BlackBerry while still trailing Android and Apple by a wide margin.) The Samsung event announcement suggests there may be three devices introduced. It features three stylized images that appear to be closeups of parts of sleek, shiny electronic gadgets. Supply-line leaks, and what appeared to be an accidental post on Samsung's apps page, suggest that a smaller S4 smartphone might be one of them. A Chinese site posted images of what appear to be two S4's side-by-side, with one visibly smaller than the other. Unconfirmed reports have suggested the ""Galaxy S4 Mini"" would have a 4.3-inch screen, compared to the 5-inch screen on the phone released earlier this year. On June 20, the Samsung event will fall between Apple's WWDC developers conference, which runs June 10-14, and Microsoft's own developers conference, Build, which begins June 26. The event will be broadcast live on Samsung's YouTube account, beginning at 6 p.m. London time (1 p.m. ET).","Samsung announces ""premiere"" event for June 20 in London .

"(CNN) -- A series of cryptic tweets and the announcement of a news conference sparked speculation that the five surviving members of British comedy troupe Monty Python may be about to reunite. And one of the members appears to have let the cat out of the bag, telling the BBC that a reunion is indeed happening.

Member Eric Idle tweeted Tuesday that there was a ""Python meeting this morning,"" after tweeting Monday: ""Only three days to go till the Python press conference. Make sure Python fans are alerted to the big forthcoming news event."" The public relations agency that sent out the invitations to the news conference declined to confirm it was to announce a reunion, saying: ""All will be revealed on Thursday.""

The shows mostly consisted of a string of barely coherent sketches, often lacking conventional punch lines and loosely tied together by Gilliam's stream of consciousness animations. The group dressed as old ladies, dressed as transvestite lumberjacks, performed sketches about pompous middle class men, used catchphrases such as ""And now for something completely different,"" and sang amusing ditties such as ""Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam ...""

Although the TV show ran for only four seasons, it proved a massive cult hit when it was shown in the United States beginning in 1974 -- just as the show was winding up on the other side of the Atlantic.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- It's just after two o'clock in the morning and a never-ending queue of South African commuters is waiting to get onto a bus that will take them to Pretoria for work. Many are carrying blankets in the hopes of getting some much-needed rest while on the three-hour journey. The year is 1983 and this is a ""blacks only"" bus, where only a lucky few will get the luxury of seating as the bus travels into the city. A single white man stands at the front of the bus watching the daily commute. His name is David Goldblatt and he's there to capture life on film. With a career spanning six decades, Goldblatt has become one of South Africa's most distinguished photographers, using a lens to chronicle the growth of a nation. His work adorns museum walls in Johannesburg and crosses oceans to Melbourne, Paris and New York. Among his most celebrated collections is his documentation of Apartheid, where he became a witness to the discrimination faced in South Africa. ""All photographers are witnesses ... I was trying to find ways into an understanding, if you like, of who we are. Apartheid was part of that,"" he tells CNN. ""Apartheid became very much the central area of my work but my real preoccupation was with our values ... how did we get to be the way we are?"" Goldblatt's love of photography stemmed from his schooldays but it wasn't until the mid 1960s, aged 32, that he launched a career as a commercial photographer. His decision to work in black and white was a direct result of his desire to convey his uncompromising view of the world. ""You need to work to look at a black and white photograph. It doesn't immediately come to you. Color is much more sensuous, sweet and welcoming,"" he says. ""(For) Apartheid and the anger and the fear that it stirred, there was no other medium than black and white."" In the early 1980s, Goldblatt was commissioned along with 19 other photographers by economist Francis Wilson as part of a collaborative essay on black life and poverty. Goldblatt had not intentionally set out to visually record the Apartheid system. But after being given the subject of public transport and working alongside his friend, New York Times correspondent Joe Liliefeldt, Goldblatt began using his lens as a means of vocalizing his protest at the segregation in the bantustans -- homelands -- northeast of Pretoria. The images he captured would become a seminal part of his photographic legacy offering a raw and naked glimpse into the hardships faced by black people who were forced into an eight-hour commute to simply go to work. ""They had got up at about half past one or two o'clock in the morning in order to get into the queues and catch the buses,"" Goldblatt vividly remembers. ""If they hadn't done that of course, they would have starved because the homelands was -- and I think this is quite deliberate -- placed in a place where there was no possibility of earning a living."" He recalls how the hardships people were forced to endure affected him, recounting a day when he stood on one of the early morning buses asking people if he could take their photograph. ""Very soon (I) realized that they couldn't have cared a damn about me. They were just interested in sitting down and if they could, getting sleep ... It was a very moving experience."" The resulting photographs continue to provide a stark insight into the difficulties faced during the years when the policy of racial discrimination was practiced in South Africa. While his images are loved across the globe, Goldblatt doesn't believe in taking beautiful photographs. To the wizened 83-year-old, it is not about aesthetics but about expressing value. ""Aesthetics is not a term that I use. I'm not interested in it. Obviously I'm very interested in how a picture works ... what it means. It's a conversation between me, myself and the subject."" The use of modern technology in the photography process has allowed Goldblatt to emerge from the dark room where he previously would have spent months painstakingly developing his shots. Advances in digital scanning and printing have also helped inspire him to spend more time working in color. ""Initially I was very skeptical, so I felt that you couldn't repeat or do the kind of nuanced printing in the dark room ... but you can, the technology is superb."" And with a wealth of experience behind him, the award-winning photographer has also turned his hand to education and passing on his craft to aspiring artists. In the 1980s he noticed that many young black people were visiting a small photography gallery where he would show some of his work. ""I became acutely aware that they had not the slightest hope of attaining a reasonable degree of visual literacy or skill in photography,"" he explains. ""Houses were overcrowded, they had no money, they had no running water, no electricity. So the possibility of being able to process films and print them is just not there."" With this in mind, Goldblatt set about raising finance and began workshops which, he proudly states, still run to this day. ""It's going and flourishing,"" he begins before modestly adding, ""but it has very little to do with me, it has to do with the people who've been directors there ... many of them could have earned far more in the commercial field. ""It really was a labor of love."" For all the acclaim he has received, Goldblatt remains unpretentious about his work, which has become a historic record of South Africa. When asked which piece or collection he is most proud of, he laughs off the question. ""Sorry -- first of all I don't speak of art. I speak of being a photographer and a crafts person ... if I had to be called before a heavenly jury to account for myself, I'd have to say 'well, look at it and decide for yourselves.'""","David Goldblatt is a world-renowned photographer from South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Thanksgiving is a week away, but it's hard to focus on the annual feast with all the ads for Black Friday sales and the Christmas decorations that have popped up everywhere in the past few weeks. Everywhere, that is, except Nordstrom. The department store is continuing its tradition of closing on Thanksgiving Day, even as retail giants like Macy's, Walmart and Toys R Us plan to open that evening and Kmart's doors will open at 6 on Thanksgiving morning. You also won't see any Christmas decorations or hear any carols in Nordstrom stores until after Thanksgiving. ""We won't be decking our halls until Friday, November 29. Why? We just like the idea of celebrating one holiday at a time,"" the signs outside the stores read. The store has been posting these signs for at least 20 years, judging by news reports dating back to 1992. And it apparently never gets old. CNN affiliate WWBT-TV in Richmond, Virginia, posted the sign on its Facebook page on Wednesday and invited followers to ""share if you agree."" Commenters mostly supported Nordstrom's decision, saying, ""Thanksgiving is a time to share with your family,"" and praising the store for ""going against the grain."" Others pointed out that some Nordstrom employees would still have to work on Thanksgiving to decorate the store and get ready for the Black Friday sales. What do you think?

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime for Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran who had long wanted to go to North Korea. It ended, according to his family, with the detention of Newman, 85, when he was pulled off a plane at Pyongyang's Sunan International Airport five minutes before it was to depart. Newman, of Palo Alto, California, has not been seen nor heard from since October 26, the day he and a traveling companion wrapped up a 10-day organized tour of North Korea, his son, Jeff Newman, told CNN. The U.S. State Department declined Thursday to confirm Newman's identity or whether he had been detained, citing privacy issues. North Korea has not publicly acknowledged that it is holding Newman. Newman's son believes the detention is the result of ""a misunderstanding."" ""My father is a (Korean War) veteran and wanted to see the country and culture he has been interested in for years,"" he said. ""He arranged this with a travel agent that was recommended and said was approved by the North Korean government for travel of foreigners. He had all the proper visas."" Jeff Newman said his family has been working through the State Department since they found out that his father was being held. ""We've worked through the State Department from the day he was supposed to depart,"" Newman said. ""... We've heard nothing."" Jeff Newman said what he has heard has primarily come from his father's traveling companion, who was on the plane. He identified the traveling companion as Bob Hamrdla, a friend who lives in the same retirement community. Newman was a customer of Juche Travel Services of London, and he traveled with ""one other gentleman"" to North Korea on the same private tour, Juche Travel spokesman David Thompson said in a written statement. ""The tour arrangements were handled by the Korea International Travel Company,"" Thompson said. ""Mr. Newman had in place all necessary and valid travel documents to take his tour. We have no information concerning what has occurred to result in the current situation."" Bargaining chip? News of the apparent detention came as talks were under way between the United States and China, North Korea's closest ally, about reviving negotiations to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program. The timing raises questions about whether North Korea plans to use Newman as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, a move the West has previously accused it of doing to try to gain concessions. Glyn Davies, the U.S. special representative to North Korea, declined to link the two, but said the detention of American citizens ""is an indication that North Korea seems not to be seeking a better relationship with the United States."" ""Again, these are separate matters, but we certainly think that North Korea should think long and hard about these cases and understand that, for the United States, these are matters of core concern for us, the fate of Americans who are in North Korea being held by North Koreans,"" he said Thursday. The United States, which does not maintain diplomatic relations with North Korea, is working with Sweden and North Korea's top ally, China, to try to resolve the issue. Questions have been raised about whether Newman's military service during the Korean War may be related to his detention. Park Syung-je, chairman of the Seoul-based Asia Strategy Institute, says Newman may have been arrested on espionage charges. As a Korean War veteran, Newman might have told his minders he fought against North Korea. They may have reported it, resulting in his detention. The U.S. Defense Department did not immediately respond Thursday to CNN's request for information on Newman's military service. Meeting with authorities . The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with ""one or two Korean authorities,"" his son said. During that meeting, Newman's service record was discussed, he said. ""I understand my dad was a bit bothered,"" Newman said. But neither he nor his traveling companion believed there was an issue. The next day, Newman and Hamrdla boarded a plane for Beijing. Five minutes before the plane was to depart, authorities boarded and asked to see Newman's passport, his son said. According to the traveling companion's account, the authorities then asked the elder Newman to leave the plane with them, Jeff Newman said. When the plane landed, Hamrdla immediately contacted the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to report Newman had been taken off the plane, the younger Newman said. 'Trip of a lifetime' The elder Newman was enjoying the trip and called home from North Korea to tell his wife about it, his son said. The family also received postcards sent by Newman during the tour of North Korea, he said. The younger Newman called his father ""old school,"" saying he never talked about his service and the Korean War. The trip to North Korea was ""months in the planning,"" the younger Newman said. He said a Chinese tour company set up the tour, which included the services of two tour guides. ""It was the trip of a lifetime,"" he said. Hamrdla has declined to speak with reporters but, in a statement, said the situation has to be a ""terrible misunderstanding."" The elder Newman suffers from a heart condition, his son said. Medication was delivered to the North Koreans via Swedish diplomats, but he said he is unsure whether the medication made it into his father's hands. ""We would like to know his status. We would like the Swedish Embassy to meet with him to ensure he's getting his medication,"" Jeff Newman said. ""At the end of the day, we'd like him to get on a plane and fly back to San Francisco. He's an 85-year-old man who followed all the protocols. He did everything that he was supposed to do."" Others detained . Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea. The other one, Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor. The North Korean government has said he was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. North Korean authorities have arrested four U.S. citizens for entering the country illegally since January 2009, the State Department said in its travel advisory Tuesday. Two other U.S. citizens who entered the country on valid visas were arrested for other reasons, and U.S. officials have received reports of other Americans being arbitrarily detained, according to the State Department. Other detained Americans . South Koreans also have been detained. In 1999, a South Korean woman, Min Young-mee, was detained for six days after apparently saying the wrong thing on a tour to North Korea's Kumkang Mountains. ""I hope the two Koreas reunite soon so we can visit each other,"" Min said. ""North Korean defectors are living well in the South."" A North Korean minder for the tour group reported her remarks to North Korean authorities. She wasn't allowed to return home with her tour group. After a written apology for violating North Korean laws, she returned safely. Travel to North Korea has increased in recent years as the government has eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Westerners to visit. On Tuesday, the State Department warned Americans not to travel to North Korea. Previously, the agency had warned U.S. citizens of the ""serious risks"" of travel to the reclusive country -- including arbitrary arrest for what would be innocuous acts elsewhere. But its last travel warning, issued on October 1, didn't include the stronger language advising against all travel. The photos North Korea didn't want you to see .

"(CNN) -- Tom Daley wanted the world to hear the truth straight from his mouth. The 19-year-old diver, who was one of Britain's heart-throb poster-boys for the London 2012 Olympics, took to YouTube Monday to reveal he is in a relationship with a man. After complaining that he had been misquoted in an interview over his sexuality, Daley recorded a five-minute clip before tweeting: ""Got something I need to say...not been an easy decision to make, hope you can support me! :)."" In the short video, he said: ""In spring this year my life changed massively when I met someone, and they make me feel so happy, so safe and everything just feels great. ""That someone is a guy."" Earlier this year, in September, the London 2012 bronze medalist was voted the world's sexiest man by leading gay magazine, Attitude. While Daley has always been cautious in commenting on his private life, he felt the time was right to make the revelation after being angered by quotes attributed to him in a recent interview. He said: ""One thing I consider to be pretty important is having a private life and you're probably thinking, 'Why did you do a book, why did you do a documentary?' ""In an ideal world I wouldn't be doing this video because it wouldn't matter, but recently I was misquoted in an interview and it made me feel really angry. ""For me honesty is important and I've always been honest. I may have been vague in some of my answers, but I've always been honest. ""One thing I've never really felt that comfortable with talking about is relationships. I've never really had a serious relationship to talk about."" Daley said he has been dating the man for several months. ""It did take me by surprise a little bit,"" he said. ""I did have in the back of my mind that something like that could happen. ""It wasn't until spring this year that something just clicked and felt right. My whole world just changed there and then. ""Of course I still fancy girls. Right now I'm dating a guy and couldn't be happier. I feel safe and it really does just feel right. People are going to have their own opinions and I think people are going to make a big deal about this. ""Is it a big deal? I don't think so. I wanted to say something and I feel like now I am ready to do it."" Daley shot to prominence in 2008 after reaching the finals of both the individual 10-meter platform and 10-meter platform synchro events at the Beijing Olympics at the age of 14. He has since go on to establish himself as a celebrity both in and out of the diving arena, gaining over 2.4 million Twitter followers and even having his own television show in the UK, called ""Splash."" His life in the public eye has not come without its problems. Daley suffered bullying at school and was subjected to vile online abuse last year after placing fourth in the synchro event at London 2012, before bouncing back to stand on the podium in the individual competition. He also lost his father Rob in 2011 following a five-year battle with cancer. But Daley says his announcement would not have been a problem for his father, although he does concede there have been ""mixed opinions"" within his family. ""People think: what would your dad say? He always said to me, 'As long as you are happy, I'm happy.' And right now I couldn't be happier. ""My mum (Debbie) has been so supportive as well. All the friends and family I have told have been so supportive, which has been great. ""I told the rest of my family today, and let's just say they had mixed opinions. Lots of them did not believe it. Lots of them wanted me to keep it quiet. ""I didn't want to get my words twisted. I wanted to put an end to all the rumors and speculation, and just say it and tell you guys. It's what I want to do. ""My friends and family are always there to support me. And I hope you guys can be too. I mean I'm still Tom, I still want to win an Olympic gold medal in Rio 2016 for Great Britain. I am still as motivated as ever to do that. It would be great to have you guys on that journey, too."" Daley will now head to Houston, Texas, for the Team GB training camp until Christmas. He follows other leading divers in making a public statement about their sexuality. Australia's Matthew Mitcham announced he was homosexual before he won gold in Beijing, while four-time Olympic champion Greg Louganis came out as gay after quitting the sport in 1995.","British diving star Tom Daley reveals he is in a gay relationship .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Six people were killed in Pakistan on Saturday when Muslim demonstrators set fire to houses in a Christian enclave and fighting broke out, local police said. Pakistani human rights activists in Lahore protest on Saturday the anti-Christian violence in Gojra village. Police said Muslims were enraged over an alleged desecration of pages in the Quran at a Christian wedding last Saturday, and held a rally to protest. The Quran is the Muslim sacred text. The Muslims went to the Christian community in Gojra City, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Lahore, and burned 40 to 50 houses. Muslims and Christians exchanged gunfire. Police said efforts to settle the concerns with dialogue so far have failed. On Thursday, 15 Christian houses in the region were also torched. Pakistan is predominantly Muslim but has a small Christian community. Meanwhile, police in Islamabad reported Friday that an al Qaeda member thought to be involved in several attacks was arrested. Bin Yamin, a senior police official in Islamabad, identified the suspect as Rao Shakir Ali. Police believe he was involved in strikes on targets such as the Danish Embassy, a rally of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chauhdary, police, and a hotel. The suspect is a resident of Sargodha, which is 165 kilometers (about 100 miles) northwest of Lahore and has a house in Rawalpindi that has been used to facilitate insurgent acts, police said. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Fighting broke out as Muslims torched 40 to 50 houses in Christian enclave .

"(CNN) -- There may be a little bit of panic that sets in as you approach a toll booth and you realize you don't have any money on you. But apparently not for some people in Texas. Take, for instance, a man and woman from Pflugerville. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, their vehicle has passed a toll booth without someone paying more than 14,000 times. Make that 14,358, to be exact. Well, through Wednesday. And the state really, really wants them to pay their bill -- $236,026.32 -- for the unpaid tolls and fines (the fines always get you). Texas gave the duo and other toll scofflaws until Wednesday to pay up or else. The else turns out to be the state publicly releasing the names of the people it says are the top 25 violators. Congratulations, Austin! All 25 are from your area. Sixteen drivers owe more than $100,000, The state says all told it is owed $27 million from across the state -- at least 28,000 drivers owe more than $100 in unpaid tolls. There is good news; Texas is willing to negotiate a settlement or give violators the option of a payment plan. CNN affiliate KXAN reported officials said they have already sent letters and made phone calls to people in advance of Wednesday's deadline. By the way, if you were wondering, if someone drove twice each day on a toll road without paying, it would take 19Â½ years to amass 14,000 violations. Texas also says if violators are pulled over for a traffic violation, they can have their cars impounded.","One vehicle has used Texas toll roads 14,000 times without paying .

"(CNN) -- A contrite Richard Heene, whose plan for fame went awry after he and his wife falsely reported that their son was drifting over eastern Colorado in a balloon, apologized Wednesday to a judge. ""I'm very, very sorry. And I want to apologize to all the rescue workers out there and the people who got involved in the community. That's it,"" Heene said quietly at his sentencing. His wife, Mayumi, sat quietly and declined to speak. Larimer County Judge Stephen Schapanski, who chose to adhere to a plea agreement, sentenced Richard Heene to 90 days in custody, to begin January 11. Heene can spend the last 60 days of the sentence in a work release program but must return to the jail at night, the judge said. Heene will be on probation for four years and must complete 100 hours of community service each year during that period. Mayumi Heene was sentenced to 20 days in jail -- less than the 60 days sought by prosecutors. The judge said her term would begin after her husband's jail sentence ends, so at least one of them can be with their children during that time. She was given the option of serving her time over 10 weekends. She also received four years' probation and must perform 120 hours of community service. The couple also must pay restitution, but no exact amount was announced in court. The judge ordered that they not benefit financially from the incident. Prosecutor Andrew Lewis outlined for the court episodes that demonstrate the extensive planning he said occurred before the October 15 balloon flight, which was aimed at generating publicity for the couple, who sought a reality TV show. ""One of those episodes had to do with filling up a weather balloon with helium that looked like a flying saucer and making it move through electric charges,"" Lewis said. The episodes were discovered when authorities searched the Heenes' home. Lewis said that a few weeks before the incident, the Heenes were told that no one was showing interest in their program proposal. He added that the couple was having trouble paying their bills. Once the balloon was aloft, Richard Heene called the Federal Aviation Administration twice and a television station, Lewis said. Heene told everyone that his 6-year-old son, Falcon, was aboard the balloon. Multiple agencies, among them the National Guard, sheriff's and fire departments, and the U.S. Forest Service, swarmed over the area to track the balloon. The Larimer County Sheriff's Department tallied the cost, including the hours spent on the investigation, to be at least $47,000. In addition, the FAA plans to impose an $11,000 fine. According to the judge, traffic at Denver International Airport was delayed during the incident. The balloon landed about 15 miles east of there, Schapanski said. The child was not found on the balloon; he came out of hiding at his parents' home several hours later. Meanwhile, TV viewers were ""transfixed"" by the saga, he said. ""This clearly was a planned event."" ""In summary, what this case is about is deception -- exploitation of the children of the Heenes, exploitation of the media, exploitation of the emotions of the people -- and it's about money. This was all done for the purpose of making money,"" Schapanski said. The Heenes pleaded guilty last month. Richard Heene was charged with the felony of attempting to influence a public servant, and his wife faced a misdemeanor charge of false reporting to authorities. Richard Heene's attorney, David Lane, said his client has expressed remorse and accepted full responsibility for what happened. He tried to convince the judge that Richard Heene didn't deserve jail time because there was no violence involved. On his client's behalf, Lane asked that Mayumi Heene not go to jail. ""That is his primary concern. He has taken full and complete responsibility. Do not send his wife to jail. That is his plea,"" Lane said. According to the wife's attorney, the couple is hated because of what happened. ""It's nothing that anybody should wish on anyone else,"" he said.","Richard Heene sentenced to 90 days; his wife to 20 days in jail .

"(CNN) -- A surfer was killed Saturday in a shark attack off the coast of Australia, at least the fifth such attack in less than a year. The man had been surfing just south of Wedge Island in Western Australia when he was taken by what is believed to be a great white, the Department of Fisheries said in a statement. The identity and age of the victim were not immediately released. Authorities were still searching for his remains. ""When last seen the shark was heading offshore, but we have placed baited lines in the water near the attack site, in an attempt to catch the shark should it return to the location or pose a threat in the area,"" said Tony Cappelluti, spokesman for the department's Shark Response Unit. Some area beaches were closed after the incident, but no further shark sightings have been reported. The stretch of water along Western Australia's southern coast is one of the deadliest for shark attacks. Three people were mauled in the water in September and October, while a fourth was taken in March while diving with his brother about one nautical mile off Stratham Beach. More people were killed by sharks along that southern coast than anywhere else in the world in 2011, according to the International Shark Attack File. ""Certainly for Australia, and Western Australia in particular, I would say that five deaths from shark attacks in less than 12 months is very unusual,"" said Cappelluti. He declined to say what might be behind the attacks, but said a lot of research is being done on the subject and that authorities hope to have more information soon. Still, others manage to come face-to-face with the aquatic creatures and live to tell the tale. Nathan Podmore and his friend were spear fishing off the coast of Western Australia, south of Perth, recently when they came across a 12-foot-long shark. ""It wasn't in attack mode. It was more curious,"" he told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. He said he and his friend fended it off before getting back to their boat. ""I always said that I would like to see one. ... No, but, I never want to see another one in the water. It's nuts,"" Podmore said.","NEW: Authorities are still searching for the victim's remains .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Kennedy, who was widely considered the front-runner for an appointment to replace Hillary Clinton as U.S. senator from New York, will remove herself from consideration for that post, according to three Democratic sources. Democratic sources said Caroline Kennedy has withdrawn her name from consideration for the Senate seat. Sources told CNN that, as of about 8 p.m. Wednesday, she had not yet informed New York Gov. David Paterson of her decision. And as the evening wore on, confusion still surrounded the situation -- sources telling CNN they were unsure of exactly where the decision stood. The 51-year-old daughter of President John F. Kennedy indicated her interest in filling the seat after Clinton was nominated to be U.S. secretary of state. Clinton was sworn in to her new position after being confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday. Since President Obama selected Clinton for the post, virtually all of the buzz about her replacement centered around Kennedy. But as the weeks dragged on, polling showed her popularity among New Yorkers dwindling. Kennedy's decision to bow out comes a day after her uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, suffered a seizure at a luncheon after Obama's inauguration. Doctors said the seizure was triggered by fatigue. Sen. Kennedy, 76, was diagnosed with brain cancer last May. Paterson has the power to appoint the replacement for the vacated seat, who then faces a special election in 2010 to fill out Clinton's term. Earlier this week Paterson said he was close, but had not yet picked Clinton's replacement. Earlier in the week, Paterson said he may interview ""a candidate or two"" while in Washington for the inauguration. He added that he could settle on a choice ""by this weekend."" Before this year, Caroline Kennedy's forays into the public sphere were generally limited to nonpartisan activity, penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father's legacy. ""I would be an unconventional choice -- I haven't followed a traditional path, but I think I bring a lifetime of experience to this,"" she told NY1 last month. The comment came during a media blitz after she had been criticized for remaining cloistered since her name was floated for the job. There are a slew of high-profile candidates for Clinton's Senate seat, including New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, whose last name carries some star power of its own in New York, where his father, Mario Cuomo, was once governor. A poll earlier this month showed slightly more New Yorkers would rather  Cuomo be appointed than Kennedy.","Caroline Kennedy had spoken publicly about her desire for Clinton's Senate seat .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Many in the West would like to see Iran punished for its nuclear ambitions. Tehran's residents would like those people to take a glimpse into their lives. The European Union announced Monday it is banning the import of Iranian crude oil and blocking trade in gold, diamonds, and precious metals, among other steps, adding to sanctions already imposed by the United States and the United Nations. The measures take a big toll on Iran's lifeblood oil revenues. The lives of ordinary Iranians have been deeply touched in recent weeks by the Western sanctions. Several spoke to CNN about how they are coping with staggering inflation and a plunging national currency, although none felt comfortable being fully identified, fearful of the Islamic Republic's long reach into private lives. Farhad, 47, was once comfortable, but things began sliding downhill when sanctions came and the foreign oil firm that employed him packed up and left. As a taxi driver, he works hard but saves little money. With the latest round of U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran's Central Bank last month, he has seen staggering inflation; the price of meat and milk have skyrocketed by as much as 50 percent. He and his wife have stopped having guests at their home or going out to eat. They can't remember when they bought new clothes and no longer send their suits to the cleaners. ""I feel bad for the cleaners,"" he says. ""They must be suffering as a result of people like me not using their services."" Farhad has a savings account that is shrinking fast as he dips into it to make ends meet. His 21-year-old son works two part-time jobs while he earns a degree in computer science. Farhad feels bad that he can't afford to buy him the computer equipment he needs. ""I wait and pray for something to spark the economy and get it going, but I am not holding my breath,"" he says. ""Life must go on. We can only wait and see what the future has in store for us."" In the meantime, he says, the only way for his sons to live a decent life is to fall in with influential people or make shady business deals like trading foreign currency on the black market. The United States and other Western powers argue sanctions that target Iran's central bank, oil exports and foreign trade are designed to push Iran to cooperate at the nuclear negotiating table. They believe the Islamic Republic is developing nuclear weapons, although Tehran insists its program is reserved strictly for civilian energy purposes. Prospects for talks have been dimmed by recent bellicose talk and actions aimed at destabilizing the Tehran government. It's doubtful, most analysts say, that punitive measures will bring Iran to its knees. Doubtful, too, is that Tehran residents will suffer the same fate as their Baghdad counterparts, who for years, under international sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime, faced dire shortages of basic goods. But as Iranian-American scholar Haleh Esfandiari put it, the latest sanctions have been back-breaking, not just for the less affluent but also for the middle class. ""People are buying less because the prices have gone up,"" she said. ""That affects the shopkeepers. It's a vicious cycle."" For many people, monthly government subsidies of $40 or $50 are no longer enough to get by, Esfandiari said. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told parliament recently that the most recent sanctions -- imposed after an International Atomic Energy Agency report that said Tehran appeared to have worked on developing a nuclear bomb -- were ""the most extensive ... sanctions ever."" Ahmadinejad called the sanctions ""the heaviest economic onslaught on a nation in history ... every day, all our banking and trade activities and our agreements are being monitored and blocked."" With the punitive measures came the downward spiral of the Iranian currency, the rial, severely devalued in the past few months against the U.S. dollar. That plunge, said CNN's Fareed Zakaria, is a key indication of Iran's instability. ""When Barack Obama became president, you could buy 9,700 rials with one dollar,"" he wrote in a column. ""Since then, the dollar has appreciated 60 percent against the rial, meaning you can buy 15,600 rials. Tehran's reaction to the prospect of sanctions that affect its oil exports shows its desperation."" The higher dollar, of course, has made imported goods unaffordable for most Iranians. Farhad says he eyed a refrigerator several months ago. It was made in Iran and affordable. But when he returned to buy it, the price had gone up 20 percent. The salesman informed him that parts of the fridge were made in South Korea. The soaring prices and declining currency values come at a time when Iran is already facing ""huge challenges"" created partly by government mismanagement and failures in foreign policy, said one economist in Iran. ""I think the situation will be aggravated in the coming months,"" he told CNN. ""We will witness higher inflation and unemployment rates with less economic growth."" Those who study the impact of sanctions argue that they must hurt in order to be effective, but not to the point where they break the economy, like they did in Iraq. That does not bode well for Iranians trying to make ends meet. Yaqoub, 59, fancies himself a retired tea man. That is, financial losses forced the office where he worked to close three years ago. He now does odd jobs. He manages to make about $200 a month and receives another $135 from the government. The youngest of his three daughters is not married yet and still lives with her parents. He says the family gave up eating fruit -- it's too pricey and now is just a treat when guests come over. Red meat went up from about $6 a kilogram to $9. Dinner at his house means vegetarian rice and beans. ""When I ask the shopkeepers why the prices keep going up, (they) say the government sets the prices and they have to do as they are told,"" he says. ""People are hungry and this is why crime has gone up."" He says his son-in-law's motorcycle was stolen in front of his house. Theft was not something he worried about before. It's not just the price of food and consumer goods that are hurting Iranians. Services like electricity and water are costing more, too. Yaqoub's monthly utility bill has almost doubled to $19 a month. Add it all up, he says, and it's tough to make it on his income. His wife tells him to stop worrying or he'll have a heart attack. ""I guess if we get really stuck for our daily expenses, I would have to move to a cheaper apartment or, in the worst case scenario, there will be no choice but to go to the north and live with my wife's parents. At least I won't have to worry about the rent there,"" he says. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian-American Council, says sanctions are putting far more pressure on Iran's citizenry than on the regime they are intend to punish. ""The government always has the ability to circumvent sanctions and shift the burden onto the population,"" Parsi says. Davood, 39, says he and his wife both have college degrees, but he earns money doing chores at an office -- making lunch, running errands, even cleaning. He worries for Assal, his 5-year-old daughter. Perhaps a day will come when he has to move to a less expensive city in order to pay for her education. ""I see no chance for me to ever find a job where I can use my university degree,"" he says. ""I am almost 40 now and as time goes by and I get older, no one will hire me. As it is, I am always worried that I may lose my job."" Some Tehran residents are stocking up on things while they can afford it, and while they are still on the shelves. Rose, a retired nurse who survives solely on her government pension, bought a supply of grains and canned foods, just in case. She also feels lucky to own her apartment, so she doesn't have to worry about making rent. She says a friend recently was hospitalized for two weeks. It cost her more than $11,000. ""Of course you cannot blame the doctors and hospitals because they have to pay for high-priced foods, materials and equipment,"" the nurse says. ""Everything is related. High prices of food affect everything."" Analysts say the government ought to be fearful of too much discontent. Unemployment and stagflation helped fuel the 2009 mass demonstrations that at times appeared on the brink of bringing change to Iran's authoritarian rule. Farhad says he understands he is caught up in global politics. ""I don't know what must be done to correct the economic condition, but I don't blame the Americans and their sanctions,"" he says. Washington has to watch out for its own interests. And Iran, he says, must do what it can to safeguard its own. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr reported from Tehran, Iran, and Moni Basu from Atlanta. CNN's Josh Levs contributed from Atlanta.","Some Tehran residents say they have cut back on what they buy, eat .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Airport screeners are giving additional scrutiny to remote-controlled toys because terrorists could use them to trigger explosive devices, the Transportation Security Administration said Monday. The TSA suggests travelers place remote-controlled toys in checked luggage. The TSA stopped short of banning the toys in carry-on bags but suggested travelers place them in checked luggage. ""Travelers may encounter additional screening when bringing remote control devices in carry-on baggage,"" the TSA said. In addition, anyone carrying such toys, including children, may have to go through secondary screening. The change was not prompted by any specific intelligence, the TSA said. Instead, it was made in response to July's National Intelligence Estimate, which concluded the United States will face ""a persistent and evolving terrorist threat"" in the coming years, and also by generalized threats that noted the use of remote-control toys as detonators. Authorities allege one of two students arrested in South Carolina in August posted a video on YouTube demonstrating how to use a remote-controlled toy to trigger a bomb. The arrested men -- Ahmed Mohamed, 26, and Youssef Megahed, 21 -- are Egyptian nationals. Mohamed allegedly told authorities he made the videotape about remote bomb detonation to help people in Arab countries fight infidels. In a statement on the TSA's Web site, Administrator Kip Hawley said, ""We work very closely with law enforcement and intelligence communities about possible methods of attack and it appears that terrorists may have an interest to use these remote-control toys as a means to initiate these devices in a terrorist attack."" Hawley added, ""We want to let passengers know that if they see some different security screening related to remote control devices, they know why we're doing it."" A TSA spokesman said the agency is publicizing the heightened scrutiny because it wants to be transparent with the public and let terrorists know ""we're on to them.""

"Tupelo, Mississippi (CNN) -- The nation knows James Everett Dutschke as the man accused of sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and two other officials. But to people who live near him, he's the guy whose alleged abuse of young girls turned their neighborhood upside down, according to one neighbor. And to a former coworker, he's the ""genius"" with a few odd quirks. Exactly who Dutschke is and why he might have taken the extreme step of sending toxic letters to Obama, a Mississippi senator and an official in Lee County, Mississippi, remained up in the air Monday as prosecutors began criminal proceedings against him for allegedly making the deadly toxin ricin and sending it through the mail. However, through court documents and conversations with people who knew him, a clearer picture is starting to emerge. Ricin suspect ordered held without bond . Resume . Dutschke appears to have a wide range of interests and has held a variety of jobs, most recently working as a martial arts instructor at a Tupelo, Mississippi, studio he ran. He once worked at an insurance company owned by the brother of a man initially arrested -- and then cleared -- in the same case in which Dutschke is now charged. According to the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal newspaper, he is a musician. Dutschke has registered several business ventures with state officials, all of which appear to be closed, according to a Mississippi Secretary of State database. In 2007, he ran as a Republican for a state House seat against incumbent Democrat Rep. Steve Holland and lost 68% to 27%. Holland is the son of Lee County Judge Sadie Holland, who received one of the ricin-laced letters. ""We just want to move on,"" Holland told CNN, adding that he wanted justice for his mother. ""This could have been devastating. Mom could have died had this taken the worst-case scenario."" In 2008, Dutschke ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for election commissioner in Lee County, according to the Daily Journal newspaper. Former suspect in ricin case: 'A train has been lifted off my shoulders' Indecency allegations . According to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by CNN, Dutschke is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. He has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media and pleaded not guilty in court this month. Dutschke closed his tae kwon do studio after the allegations were made public. Last year, residents in his Tupelo neighborhood sought police help after, one neighbor says, Dutschke repeatedly exposed himself to young girls. The case resulted in a conviction on indecent exposure charges and a 90-day jail sentence. He has appealed the conviction, according to the Daily Journal newspaper. ""He was pretty well terrorizing the neighborhood,"" said neighbor Dennis Carlock, who said the Dutschke family rarely stepped outside their home. For Carlock, the fact that Dutschke is accused of sending a potentially lethal poison to public officials is secondary to what happened in his neighborhood. ""I don't care how they got him, as long as they got him out of this neighborhood,"" he said. Genius? Carlock had almost exclusively bad things to say about Dutschke, with one exception: He said his neighbor is extremely smart. Apparently, Dutschke thought so too. He sometimes showed off a card from Mensa, a group for people with high intelligence quotients, according to Laura Curtis, who worked with Dutschke at the insurance company. ""A lot of the people in the office thought he was odd,"" she said, adding that she liked him. ""I knew he was a genius, and you know how geniuses act a little different,"" she said. CNN's Vivian Kuo reported from Tupelo, Mississippi; Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Dana Ford, Rich Phillips and Alina Machado contributed to this report.","James Everett Dutschke is accused of sending ricin-tainted letters to Obama and others .

"(CNN) -- Instead of keeping the government running and focusing on the economy and other pressing issues facing the country, the House leadership has decided to play politics with women's health and economic stability. In its 43rd vote to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the House has shut down the government to delay the law's implementation until 2015. It is a desperate attack that could leave millions of people without health coverage. But a small group of far-right members of the House pushed through a provision that goes even further, passing an amendment that would allow employers and insurance companies to refuse to cover women's preventive health care because they have a personal ""moral"" objection. This would include birth control, HPV testing, breast-feeding services and counseling for domestic violence. Any employer or insurance company could refuse to cover them, and women would have no recourse. It's a clause that could easily be abused by employers and insurers. And the amendment only covers the women's preventive benefit -- employers would not be able to refuse to cover preventive care specific to men for ""moral"" reasons. But . This is from the same House Republican leaders who tried to shut the government down in 2011 over funding for Planned Parenthood's cancer screenings, birth control and other preventive health care services and have tried dozens of times since then to block women from making their own personal medical decisions. This unprecedented and ongoing attack on women's health is out of touch with the needs of millions of women and is deeply unpopular with the American public. Seven in 10 Americans believe that health insurance companies should cover the full cost of birth control, just as they do for other preventive services. These policies are working. Already, 27 million women across the country have been able to receive preventive health care without a co-pay, and an estimated 47 million will benefit when the law takes full effect. These investments in women's health services are not only providing women with more control over their health and their own family planning, but they are also a great deal for taxpayers. According to research released by the Guttmacher Institute this summer, for every $1 we invest in birth control services, we save nearly $6 in the long term. It's a smart policy for the health of women and for our nation's economy. This is why earlier this year, Planned Parenthood members and our allies submitted more than 350,000 comments to the Department of Health and Human Services in support of the benefit. These comments came from women and men in all 50 states, and we continue to hear from women every day who are already benefiting from birth control with no co-payss. We hear from women such as Ariel of Ridgewood, New Jersey, a 23-year-old who wrote to us to say that she just married ""the love of my life"" and plans to have children one day -- when she and her new husband are ready. They both have ""piles of student loans"" to pay first, and she can barely afford birth control if it weren't covered. Ariel and others like her will suffer if this narrow group of GOP members of Congress succeed in their crusade to keep women from having access to birth control and other preventive care. Although it's not the first time they've tried, it's alarming how far some members of the GOP will go to attack the women's preventive benefit and the ACA itself. As the leading women's health care provider and advocate, Planned Parenthood has fought hard to protect this benefit from the beginning because we know that birth control is basic, preventive health care for women, and it is a key economic issue for women and their families. The country wants Congress to focus on jobs and the economy, not on pushing an extreme agenda against women's access to health care. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cecile Richards.","Cecile Richards: House took its 43rd vote trying to kill the Affordable Care Act .

"(CNN) -- Summer is inching upon us, and that means kids at public pools will be splashing, barbecues in the backyard will be blazing and a slate of blockbusters will start crowding around ""The Avengers"" at cineplexes. While all this is going on, one song will be blaring from car radios, tinny laptop speakers and hot dog stands at the beach. And that tune will be deemed the song of the summer. Of course, each year around this time, anyone with fingers and a Twitter account -- let alone a published byline -- is eager to latch onto a budding chart hit and declare that, yes, this one particular three-minute confection of perfection is definitely going to be the song of the summer. And if, by chance, that song still happens to be heavily crackling across the airwaves at an hourly rate in August, well, good for those pop prophets. Pat on the back. You were right. Bravo. But let's just state the obvious: pop does have a way of weaving itself into the fabric of our summer experiences. (Think of these recent, inescapable scorchers: Katy Perry's ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""California Gurls"" in 2008 and 2010, respectively, the Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling"" in 2009 and LMFAO's ""Party Rock Anthem"" last year.) So why, then, doesn't anyone ever focus on the big hits that come along in December, or, for that matter, February? Is there some law that decrees June, July and August are the only zeitgeist-approved months on the calendar? Well, no. But song of the winter just doesn't have the same sexy ring to it, and who wants to cruise around sleeveless with the windows down when it's 24 degrees outside anyway? That brings us to 2012's upcoming stretch of sunny days, and Carly Rae Jepsen. Many sites will inform you that the 26-year-old Canadian's bouncy, string-laden ""Call Me Maybe"" is a song of the summer shoe-in (or, at the very least, one of the top contenders). And almost like clockwork, the single has inched up to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, just as Gotye's six-week reign on top with ""Somebody That I Used To Know"" seems to be winding down. Not up on Carly Rae or ""Call Me Maybe""? You've been living under a rock, we see. Below are the only three points you'll need to know: . Her first big break: The Mission, British Columbia, brunette placed third on ""Canadian Idol"" in 2007. Her first album, ""Tug of War,"" was released in her home country the following year, and her EP ""Curiosity"" arrived this past February on Valentine's Day. How she blew up: Fellow Canadian Justin Bieber and his manager, Scooter Braun, signed Jepsen earlier this year to a deal with their Schoolboy Records label. ""Call Me Maybe"": As the legend goes, Bieber and girlfriend Selena Gomez heard the song on the radio while visiting Canada in January. An alternate music video for ""Call Me Maybe"" (different from the official clip) features Bieber and Gomez, as well as pals Ashley Tisdale and members of Big Time Rush, lip-syncing along with the track. The vid went viral, and has more than 74 million views. To date, the single has topped the charts in Canada, Australia and the UK, and gone Top 10 in over a dozen other countries. It's worth pointing out that while there has been lots of speculation that it could be the ""perfect pop song,"" Jepsen's breakout hit has been breaking out for quite some time now. It was first released in September, and by April it had become a radio staple here in the States. But with June looming in the distance, it's tricky to peg this slice of disco-pop that's been around for eight months as the definitive song of summer 2012. For starters, Carly Rae has some stiff competition in the forms of her pal Justin Bieber's Timberlake-like single ""Boyfriend"", Maroon 5's ode to antiquated communication methods ""Payphone,"" Train's similarly upbeat stomper ""Drive By"" and Pitbull's ""Men in Black 3"" soundtrack jam ""Back in Time."" She also faces peaking early in the summer with ""Call Me Maybe,"" then having it slide away by the time fireworks start shooting off, in the wake of other new tracks that will catch the ears of iTunes-clicking tweens. Last summer, for instance, Maroon 5 and Christina Aguilera's ""Moves Like Jagger"" didn't come along until late June. By August, ""The Voice"" coaches' pair-up was unavoidable on radio, and it went on to spend four weeks atop the Hot 100. But it's late May, and right now you probably just want to know whether or not ""Call Me Maybe"" is going to be the hands-down song of summer 2012. We'll certainly concede that it was the song of spring. As for summer? We'll say definitely ... maybe. Sorry, Carly.","One song will soon be blaring in the background, and that tune will be the song of the summer .

"(CNN) -- Former Black Panther Elmer ""Geronimo"" Pratt, who was wrongly imprisoned for 27 years on a murder conviction, died Thursday in Tanzania, his former lawyer said. He was 63. Stuart Hanlon, a San Francisco-based lawyer who helped overturn Pratt's murder conviction, said he did not know the exact cause of death. Pratt died in a small village in Tanzania where he lived with his wife and child, Hanlon said. Hanlon called Pratt a ""true American,"" saying that he was an Army veteran who served two tours in Vietnam before joining the Black Panther Party. ""He could've been a great leader. He was very charismatic,"" Hanlon said. ""His legacy is that he never gave up. He never got despondent or angry."" Pratt's conviction became a rallying cry for rights groups that said he had been framed for his strident activism during the turbulent civil rights era. Pratt was convicted for the 1968 murder of Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court. He spent 27 years in prison before the conviction was overturned in 1997 after a judge ruled that prosecutors had concealed evidence. The victim's husband, wounded during the robbery attempt, originally identified another man as the killer. But the jury was not informed of that, the judge said. Famed attorney Johnnie Cochran also helped in the legal battle to get Pratt released from prison. Pratt spoke at Cochran's funeral in 2005. After his release, Pratt told CNN that he held no bitterness about the many years he spent behind bars. ""I don't think bitterness has a place. I'm more understanding,"" Pratt said in a 1999 interview. ""Understanding doesn't leave any room for bitterness or anger."" Of the 27 years he spent in prison, Pratt said eight was in solitary confinement. He said his spirituality and love of music helped him through that period. ""My mantra was the blues. It would go through my head when I was going through my meditations,"" Pratt said. CNN's Erica Henry contributed to this report.","Pratt was convicted of the 1968 murder of a California woman .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Alan Gross, a U.S. State Department contractor jailed in Cuba, received his first visit by American doctors, Gross' attorney said Thursday. ""A U.S. medical team did visit Alan in early July,"" Gross' attorney, Scott Gilbert, wrote CNN in an e-mail. ""The family has received the results and, at least at this time, does not have any plans to release them to the public."" The doctors' visit was not previously disclosed. Gross, 64, is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing banned communications equipment to Cuba as part of a State Department program to increase access to the internet and spread democracy on the island. Gross' family has said that his health is failing and had asked that Cuban authorities allow American doctors to examine him. Cuban authorities had said that Gross was being adequately cared for in the military hospital where he is imprisoned, but in June said they had granted permission for doctors to visit. The change in course comes as Cuba intensifies its campaign to secure the release of Cuban intelligence agents serving lengthy prison sentences in the United States. Cuban officials argue that the men infiltrated hard-line Cuban exile groups to prevent terrorist attacks on the island. But U.S. prosecutors called the men spies, and they were convicted in 2001. Four of the agents remain in U.S. federal prison. The fifth man, Rene Gonzalez, returned to Cuba in May after serving 14 years in prison and on supervised release. Cuba's talks of a possible prisoner trade have been dismissed by U.S. officials, who say Gross should be released immediately. In May, Gross settled with his employer for an undisclosed sum. He and his wife, Judy, had sued Development Alternatives Inc., and the U.S. government for $60 million, saying that Gross had not been properly trained to carry out his work in Cuba. The settlement did not include the government. The company hired Gross to fulfill a U.S. Agency for International Development contract to connect private citizens to the Internet in Cuba, a scarce commodity on the island. He arrived in Cuba in 2009.","U.S. doctors visit American jailed in Cuba .

"(CNN) -- If you're at a coffee shop, anywhere in Philadelphia, or if it's late at night, hang on to your smartphone. Losing your smartphone can be stressful, given how much important data and access to services a typical one contains. On average, people lose their smartphone once per year, according to Lookout Mobile Security. Recently, Lookout analyzed phone loss data and found some interesting trends about where and when people lose their phones. This data is presented on a new interactive website, Mobile Lost and Found. Lookout gathered data from its mobile security app, which is on more than 15 million cell phones around the world (mostly Android phones). In 2011, Lookout found 9 million smartphones. (The company considered a phone as having gone missing whenever a user logged in to Lookout via the Web to find a phone.) ""Losing your phone is absolutely the biggest mobile security risk cell phone owners currently face, even more than malware,"" said Kevin Mahaffey, Lookout's chief technology officer. ""People lose their phones in the places they go every day. It's not a stray comet from the sky snatching your phone. That's why we wanted to study this."" When are people most likely to lose their phone? Lookout found that the vast majority of smartphone losses happen late at night, from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Looks like nightlife may be a culprit. But on holidays, or during major events such as festivals or big sporting events, people are especially likely to lose a phone. In 2011, phone losses around the world spiked on Christmas and New Year's Eve. And on February 27, 2011, phones in Dublin, Ireland, were lost at nearly three times the normal rate during a major international rugby tournament there. In general, throughout the United States, the five types of places where people are most likely to lose a cell phone are coffee shops, bars, restaurants, at the office or at home. Also, the five U.S. cities where people are most likely to lose a smartphone are Philadelphia; Seattle; Oakland, California.; Long Beach, California; and Newark, New Jersey. Mahaffey observed that several of the top phone-losing cities also have high crime rates, but that doesn't necessarily mean that more phones are stolen in these cities. Lookout's data does not indicate what actually happened to those missing phones -- how many were stolen vs. lost, or how many were eventually found. That might be a subject for future Lookout research, he said. However, where you're most likely to lose your phone may depend on which city you live in. For instance, people in Austin, Texas, are most likely to lose phones at a gas station or garage, at the grocery store or at a pizza place. But church is the third most common setting where Chicagoans lose their phones. And in Atlanta, people are most likely to lose a phone at the office. One reason why losing your smartphone is so risky is that recent research by Symantec (another mobile security provider) showed that more than 95% of the time, people who find lost smartphones try to access sensitive data or accounts on those phones -- which can including e-mail, online banking, photos and more. This is why it's so important to always protect your cell phone with at least a security passcode or swipe pattern. What's the cost of a lost smartphone? Lookout estimates the average replacement cost (just the device, not counting costs associated with lost data, international phone calls, unauthorized online purchases and illicit access to online banking or other accounts) is about $200. ""For a lot of people, $200 is a lot of money,"" Mahaffey said. ""It could be a month's rent, or groceries."" That said, Mahaffey emphasized that Lookout didn't conduct this research to frighten people, but rather to help them understand the importance of protecting your phone. ""You should never be afraid of your phone,"" he said, ""But you should know how to protect it."" Consistently using a passcode or swipe pattern to lock your phone is the most basic level of protection -- not just from a random person who finds your lost phone, or a deliberate thief or snooper, but also from police. Courts in several states have authorized police to conduct warrantless searches of cell phones seized from people under arrest, but they probably cannot compel an arrestee to unlock a seized phone. Several mobile security services offer additional features (for an annual fee) such as causing a lost phone to beep (which can help if you just can't find where you put it down at home), or to show the current location of the phone on a map (which in one case helped catch a carjacker), or to remotely lock or even wipe all data and contacts from a lost or stolen phone. The opinions expressed in this report are solely those of Amy Gahran.","95% of the time, people who find lost smartphones try to access sensitive data, research shows .

"Tachikawa, Japan (CNN) -- U.S. and Japanese authorities were investigating two small explosions Thursday outside an American air base near Tokyo, officials said. Investigators found two metal tubes and a simple timing device, which U.S. authorities described as an ""improvised launch device,"" near the Yokota Air Base. ""We can confirm there was an improvised launch device outside Yokota over the evening,"" according to a statement released by the base. ""... We take matters of security at our installation very seriously and we are assisting the Japanese National Police in their investigation into the matter."" No injuries were reported, and U.S. investigators combed the base for most of the night and into the early morning hours searching for possible impact points, said Capt. Ray Geoffroy, an Air Force spokesman. Residents outside the base reported hearing two small, cannon-type bangs at about 11 p.m. local time, the Tachikawa Police Department said. Daisy Gonzaga, who was staying near the base, said she heard two explosions. At first, she said she thought they were fireworks being set off as part of a Thanksgiving Day celebration inside the base. Gonzaga said when she did not see the fireworks, she thought it might be something a little more serious. CNN's Kevin Wang contributed to this report.","Investigators found an ""improvised launch device"" outside of Yokota Air Base, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Alec Baldwin and his daughter Ireland have apparently mended their differences. The 18-year-old model used Twitter to defend her father after his use of an anti-gay slur. The younger Baldwin insists that her dad ""has a kind heart."" ""For someone who has battled with anger management issues, my dad has grown tremendously,"" she tweeted. ""My dad is far from a homophobe or a racist."" (CNN has not been able to verify that the Twitter account belongs to Ireland Baldwin.) His daughter knows a great deal about such anger issues. In 2007 a voice mail was leaked in which the actor ranted and called his then-11-year-old daughter a ""rude, thoughtless little pig."" Recently Alec Baldwin lashed out at a paparazzo who was outside his Manhattan apartment and called the man a ""c******king f*g."" That resulted in both GLAAD and CNN's Anderson Cooper taking Baldwin to task. ""Wow, Alec Baldwin shows his true colors yet again,"" Cooper tweeted. ""How is he going to lie and excuse his anti-gay slurs this time?"" Ireland Baldwin said via Twitter that ""Paparazzi can bring out many confined feelings of anger and spite out of anyone"" and that ""... what my dad said was WRONG. What my dad felt WASN'T."" ""Boundaries have to be made,"" she said ""Paparazzi have jobs to do, but some of them jeopardize people's lives and cross a line. My dad has an INFANT CHILD to protect."" The ""30 Rock"" star has had a rough time of it lately, with MSNBC putting his show ""Up Late"" on a two-week suspension in the wake of the scandal. A rep for MSNBC told CNN the show is scheduled to return after the suspension. On Saturday, Baldwin -- who had already apologized for the slur he used against the photographer -- posted a piece on The Huffington Post in which he said he would never again use the term ""toxic queen"" as he did in referring to a tabloid journalist. He expressed amazement at how he has been characterized. ""My friends who happen to be gay are baffled by this,"" he wrote. ""They see me as one who has recently fought for marriage equality and has been a supporter of gay rights for many years. Now, the charge of being a 'homophobic bigot,' to quote one crusader in the gay community, is affixed."" He also asked that his network not be judged by his actions. ""Don't allow my problem to be MSNBC's problem,"" he said in his piece. ""They are good people who work hard at a job, just like many of you. And two, please respect the privacy of my wife and family. If you have an opinion of me, then express it. Think what you like. But I ask that my wife, who I care about more than words can say, and both my children, be left out of this.""

"(CNN) -- Aaron Sorkin, the celebrated screenwriter whose punchy dialogue propelled TV's ""The West Wing"" and the Facebook movie ""The Social Network,"" will write and direct an upcoming film on the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Sony Pictures has confirmed that Sorkin will adapt ""Steve Jobs,"" the in-depth biography of the tech icon that was written by Walter Isaacson and released shortly after Jobs' death last year. ""Steve Jobs' story is unique: he was one of the most revolutionary and influential men not just of our time but of all time,"" Amy Pascal, co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said in a written release. ""There is no writer working in Hollywood today who is more capable of capturing such an extraordinary life for the screen than Aaron Sorkin; in his hands, we're confident that the film will be everything that Jobs himself was: captivating, entertaining, and polarizing."" Sorkin won an Academy Award for adapting ""The Social Network,"" which in 2010 propelled Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to household-name status. His other work includes ""A Few Good Men,"" ""Moneyball,"" ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" ""The West Wing"" and ""Sports Night."" The yet-unnamed Steve Jobs film will be Sorkin's first movie-directing gig. Sony reportedly wanted Sorkin for the film and began courting him immediately after securing the rights to Isaacson's book late last year. Sorkin actually knew Jobs and wrote a piece for The Daily Beast about his memories of Jobs after his death. He wrote that he and Jobs had developed a ""phone friendship"" that led Jobs to invite him to write a movie for Pixar (the animation studio Jobs ran) and to tour Apple. ""I told him I'd take him up on it and I never did,"" Sorkin wrote. ""But I still keep thinking about that Pixar movie. And for me, that's Steve's legacy. That, and the fact that I wrote this on a Mac that I loved taking out of the box."" Another Jobs movie is also in the works. An independent film starring ""That '70s Show"" alum Ashton Kutcher is scheduled to begin filming in May.","Aaron Sorkin will write and direct biopic on Steve Jobs .

"(CNN) -- Sarah Murnaghan, the Philadelphia girl who underwent a lung transplant last week following a court battle, is out of a coma and responsive. The 10-year-old woke up Friday night, said Tracy Simon, a family spokeswoman. Although she remains on a ventilator and is unable to talk, she is nodding and shaking her head in response to questions, Simon said. Prior to her surgery, Sarah, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, was put in a medically induced coma to allow her body needed rest prior to the transplant surgery. Her family fought to allow children to compete with adults waiting for lungs based on sickness in a case that has sparked a public debate. She received new lungs on June 12 after a six-hour surgery that included resizing lungs from a grownup. ""We expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're going for possible. And an organ donor has made this possible for her,"" the family said in a statement. The parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. This month, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists. Sarah received lungs donated by an adult, according to Simon, meaning the lungs needed to be modified. She has been in and out of hospitals her entire life, but her condition worsened this year. Her lungs had been deteriorating rapidly over the past few months -- much faster than anyone in her family expected. In May, doctors told her mother, Janet Murnaghan, that Sarah had less than five weeks to live. With just weeks left, Sarah fights the system for life-saving pair of lungs . ""We knew at some point, she would need new lungs,"" her father, Fran Murnaghan, said in May. ""We had hoped it would be much further down the road, but the disease has progressed."" At that time, Sarah had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months. The Murnaghans were under the impression that the transplant would happen any day, since she was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region. But children's organs rarely become available. In 2012, there were just 10 transplants in Sarah's age group, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Comparatively, there were more than 1,700 adult transplants in the same year. Only people 12 years and older qualified for the adult lungs. Doctors previously have said they believe modified adult lungs could save her life. Her family contacted a lawyer this month, who petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules that keep children under 12 from being prioritized for donated lungs. Sebelius had previously told the family that she didn't have the authority to intervene in a particular case, but she did also call for a policy review. Any change in the policy, though, could take up to two years -- time the Murnaghans didn't have. In a letter before the surgery, the family argued the rule was making it all but impossible for Sarah to receive a lung; every adult on the list would have to turn down the lung to let the little girl have it. ""The Under 12 Rule is unfair, arbitrary and capricious, inconsistent with the statute and regulations, and stands in the way of Sarah potentially receiving a set of lungs that she needs to live,"" wrote Stephen G. Harvey, the family's lawyer. Dying girl's plight sparks fight over organ transplants . ""We have never, ever asked that Sarah get special attention or be placed in front of anyone more severe than her,"" her father said at the time. ""So if there ... is another adult who is more severe, who has a higher lung allocation score, they will still get their lungs first."" Several factors determine someone's place in line on the adult list: distance from donor to potential recipient, a lung allocation score determined by a patient's diagnosis and test results, and a patient's blood type. Several lawmakers also got involved urging Sebelius to act. Rep. Patrick Meehan and Sen. Pat Toomey, both from Pennsylvania, co-signed a letter sent to HHS. It read: ""You have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for Sarah and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs."" On June 5, the Murnaghan family asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block Sebelius from having the agency that oversees transplants apply the policy. The judge granted the injunction and ordered Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive the rule in Sarah's case. Sebelius sent a letter to the OPTN the following day directing it to comply with the judge's order.

"(CNN) -- A lifetime may be too short to recover from the loss of a child, let alone just a year. Nicole Hockley knows this. Adam Lanza shot dead her 6-year-old son, Dylan. Her wounds are still raw. And the release Wednesday of the 911 calls to police after Lanza charged into Sandy Hook Elementary with an assault rifle was like rubbing salt on those wounds. ""I have no desire whatsoever to hear the slaughter of 26 people, including my 6-year-old boy. And I can't imagine why anyone else would want to hear that as well,"" Hockley told CNN. She absolutely did not want a judge to release the recordings of the December 14 massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed the lives of 20 first-graders and six teachers. After the release, media organizations struggled with how to handle the material. Some news outlets, including CNN, opted to air portions of the recordings, including a 911 call from a school secretary, one from a teacher and one from a janitor. Other news organizations decided not to use any of the material directly, instead describing some of the recordings in news coverage without airing or posting any of the contents. Hockley says she'll do her best to avoid hearing the voices describing the horror of that day, of gunfire popping in the background. But she's afraid of happenstance. ""I don't know if I'm going to turn on the radio one day, or turn on the TV one day, or be Googling on something and just happen to come across them by accident,"" Hockley said. Bringing back memories . Parents of the murdered students were able to leverage the law to prevent the release of the crime scene photos from that day. But some of them are upset they couldn't hold back the 911 recordings. The Associated Press had requested they be made public in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Scenes of grieving parents on the day of the shooting are still vivid in the mind of Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Now that the call recordings are out, he's concerned about the pain they'll cause. ""I think the tapes bring back those memories,"" he said. But the appeals judge, who upheld the decision to release them, didn't really have a choice, he said. Judge Eliot Prescott was afraid that holding them back would ""fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials."" The good in the bad . Cristina Hassinger, who lost her mother to Lanza's bullets, agrees with Prescott's decision -- despite her personal anguish. Hassinger's mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was the school principal. She was confronting Lanza when he gunned her down. Hassinger believes that knowing is better than not knowing. The calls belong to the American public, she said. And they can help the country deal with future shootings. ""They don't belong to the victims' families, painful as they may be, and there is nothing on the recordings that violates the victims' privacy,"" Hassinger said. ""The public has the right to know."" Psychologists divided . Psychologists were divided on how to handle the calls. Judy Ho frowns on their release, particularly the effect they might have on children who hear them. ""There are computers everywhere. Even if you have parental control, kids can get past that and listen to these tapes themselves,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon. She fears the exposure will trigger post-traumatic stress disorder, even in people who have no connection to the school or its community. But clinical psychologist Jeff Gardere believes that the pain of reliving those moments will help people process the trauma. ""I think listening to these tapes, of course, will open old wounds. But sometimes you do have to open them in order to clean them out."" Neil Heslin purposely used the recordings to reopen his own. ""I had felt it was something that I needed to do, that I wanted to do,"" he said. ""Just to know. Jesse was my son. I brought him into the world."" Jesse died at Lanza's hands. ""You can only try to imagine what it's like to lose a child,"" Heslin said. ""And unless you've lost a child, you can't imagine. The best description I can give is it's like losing a leg and an arm ... and not being able to hold yourself up or support yourself."" Heslin got to spend just six short years with his son before Jessie was lowered into the ground. And this holiday season will be especially tough for his family. Heslin plans to take down a Christmas tree he set up with Jesse after Thanksgiving last year. They planned to decorate it in a few days. They never did. CNN's Pamela Brown and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","Nicole Hockley lost her son Dylan, 6, in the Newtown shooting .

"(CNN) -- Incredible architecture and art are splendid and interesting enough but when I go to Italy, I want to eat. Which is why, after a dozen trips to the country, I decided to settle into the city of Bologna for a few weeks and consume as much as I possibly could. Now, every Italian will tell you that their region makes the best food. But for many, the best Italian food comes from the region of Emilia-Romagna, of which Bologna is the capital. Meat ragu, tortellini, lasagna, parmigiano cheese, mortadella, coppa and balsamic vinegar -- all have roots here and the resulting regional dishes are truly sublime. Through dozens of meals at dozens of restaurants, I compiled this one-day dining guide to the culinary and sensory overload that is Emilia-Romagna. The only two requirements? Bring extra cash and arrive hungry. Really hungry. Eat Like a Local: Share your favorite spots for superb regional eats . A light, social start . The Italian breakfast or colazione, is much lighter than the American version. It involves a simple coffee and a pastry, often filled with custard, cream or chocolate. My Italian friends, Odette and Mauro Messori, took me to their favorite breakfast stop one morning. For four years, every single day, the Messoris have walked 15 minutes downtown to the Fashion CafÃ© (Via Massimo D'azeglio 34). This modern and unusual version of the typical Italian coffee shop is situated inside a bookstore. Mauro peruses books and orders his daily macchiato while Odette prefers a frothy and creamy cappuccino estivo. ""Le gente,"" or the people, however, are what Mauro loves most about his breakfast stop. In Italy, breakfast is more a social event than anything else, where you catch up with friends and start the day with hugs, handshakes and small talk. Pastry and coffee is more of an afterthought, but a really tasty one. I also stumbled upon a wonderful coffee bar during my stay, called Le Petit CafÃ© (Strada Maggiore 25), just a few minutes walk east of downtown. The coffee is excellent and prepared with great care, made better with a slice of fresh bread topped with a dollop of locally made marmellata. Delizioso. The real eating begins . Lunch in Italy was once regarded as the most important meal of the day. Now, as the cities and towns modernize and more of the younger people are working in offices rather than the fields, lunchtime has become less complex and time consuming. Unless of course, you're a tourist like myself and want to eat till your belly extends and your breath shortens. If that's the case, many restaurants still oblige. One such restaurant is All'Osteria Bottega (Via Santa Caterina 54), about a 20-minute walk from downtown on a quiet unassuming street. Plan to take your time here and arrive ravenous. My friend Vanessa and I ordered a regional white wine and enthusiastically awaited our antipasti: homemade pickled vegetables in olive oil which were perfectly balanced and not too acidic. Next arrived the famous Culatello di Zibello or regional Parma ham aged for one year along the Po River -- an area whose winter fogs and humid summers make the air unlike any other in the world, plus the local Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, aged 30 months. To taste the finest parmigiano cheese is not understood until tried, savored. Vanessa's stuffed zucchini with meatballs evoked memories of how her own Italian grandmother used to cook, while my freshly made rigatoni with a white ragout of small sausage meatballs, cannellini beans and rosemary was by far the most memorable pasta experience I had in Emilia-Romagna. You just can't believe food can taste this good. (Delicious local dishes tortellini in brodo and tagliatelli al ragu are also on the menu here.) Satiated, we passed on a second course in exchange for the hot chocolate cake with red currants. One fork piercing elicited a liquid chocolate so good I couldn't speak. I just about licked my plate clean, like any good Italian. An irresistible snack . Get up slowly. With a satisfied lethargy, walk along the pretty porticoes that are the backbone to this cosmopolitan city. After 30 minutes or so, I like to think you've walked long enough to deserve a gelato. Dating back to the 16th century in Italy, gelato is made primarily with milk rather than cream, giving it a lower milk-fat content than ice cream. It's denser than American ice cream with less air whipped into it, which intensifies the flavors. Stefino Bio is an innovative gelato shop, situated on Via Petroni close to the University, that uses all organic ingredients. Their specialties include chocolate and pistachio-based flavors. Try the wasabi gelato or chocolate with ginger. To eat more at this point seems almost inconceivable, but it's amazing what a late day leisurely stroll and an espresso can do. You sit down to rest in a pretty piazza, the stomach growls slightly and your next thought appears with an anxious, slow smile, ""Time for dinner!"" One more delicious meal . ""To give is to receive,"" is the mantra followed by the owner of Ristorante da Fabio, a cozy family-run restaurant that's located in the Castiglione area. Gluttons find true bliss here as dishes are brought out in succession, delivered in big, family style bowls. If any meal felt like an Italian feast, it was this dinner. Mozzarella di bufala, ricotta cheese, crusted bread, liver pate, baked tomatoes with cheesy breadcrumbs, celery salad, grilled eggplant, braised endive, roasted zucchini, mortadella, prosciutto ... Yes, we ate all of that, and that was just the antipasti. Great Italian food forces you to stop and take your time. We savored every bite, paused for audible and elongated 'mmmms,' and pressed on with mushroom risotto and fettuccine with pumpkin and pancetta. Both dishes reminded me that if you take deep breaths, you might make room for a little more. We drank, ate, drank, ate and finished our plates. Breathe ... In Bologna, you can get around quite well with English. But it is wise to learn a few words and phrases, like ""Basta"" (stop) ""Sono piena"" (I am full) or ""No ce la faccio piu"" (I can't take anymore). Feast in all these restaurants in just one day and you'll be repeating every one of these phrases. But the peculiar thing is, you'll head home, have a good slumber, wake up and want to do it all over again. Pasticcini anyone? Follow CNN Travel on Twitter @CNNTravel .

"New York (CNN) -- Norman Rockwell's painting ""Saying Grace"" sold for $46 million -- a record for works by the late artist and for a single American painting -- Wednesday at Sotheby's American Art auction. Rockwell is remembered most as the illustrator of The Saturday Evening Post, where he captured Americans' day-to-day lives. ""We are thrilled -- it's a really great moment for American art and for Rockwell,"" Elizabeth Goldberg, head of the American Art Department at Sotheby's, said. Warhol painting sells for $105.4 million . ""Saying Grace,"" which features a boy praying with an elderly woman in a crowded restaurant, was originally estimated to go for $20 million before the auction. The selling price nearly tripled Rockwell's previous auction record, ""Breaking Home Ties"" which sold for $15.4 million in 2006, according to Sotheby's. Seven of Rockwell's paintings sold Wednesday came from the family of Kenneth J. Stuart Sr. -- a longtime friend of the artist, and art editor at The Saturday Evening Post -- and nearly totaled $60 million, according to Sotheby's. Francis Bacon painting auctioned for more than $142 million, breaks record . The other top two Rockwell sales were ""The Gossips,"" which had a pre-sale estimate of $6 million to $9 million and sold for a little under $8.5 million, and ""Walking to Church,"" which had a pre-sale estimate of $3 million to $5 million and sold for a little over $3.2 million. ""Saying Grace"" originally appeared on the Thanksgiving issue cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1951. The painting hung in Stuart office and later on was transferred to the family dining room, according to Sotheby's catalog.

"(CNN) -- As a long-time aviation journalist and regular traveler, I've been following the debate on whether the use of cell phones and other wireless devices should be allowed on airplanes. And now that the Federal Communications Commission has said it will weigh in on the matter, let me add my voice to the growing chorus of those who are firmly opposed to the idea. Letting passengers talk nonstop during flights would be like being stuck in hell. Let me explain. I'm a working mother who is a student pilot and active in several professional and church activities. The airplane is one of the few places on (or over the) earth where I can sit quietly and not worry about answering or making phone calls. Yes, I have used airline WiFi to sneak in some work or surf the Internet, but mostly I put on my noise-canceling headphones and relax as much as one can on a commercial coach flight. But all that peace would be ruined if cell phones were allowed to be used on planes. Could you imagine the cacophony of chatter you would hear on a Baltimore-to-Chicago flight? I can, because I've heard it already. I used to take the Amtrak Acela train between Baltimore and New York City pretty regularly. On those rare occasions when I couldn't get a seat in the Quiet Car, it was sheer hell, even with headphones. I heard privileged conversations that would get lawyers fired. I listened to talk that wasn't fit for children under 17. I was forced to eavesdrop on people discussing personal, private matters -- all done in normal tones. And people didn't hesitate in trying to have their loud conversations even in the Quiet Car. So sit back, close your eyes, and imagine hearing all those conversations trapped in a high-speed metal tube flying between Washington and San Francisco, or New York to Paris. How many hours is that? Do you really want to hear the chatter of people sitting right next to you or 15 feet away? Even if the talks are muffled through your noise-canceling headphones, that doesn't make it any better. What if you just want to sleep through the flight? Or take a respite from the always-on connected life you have on the ground? Travelers already get a sense of what this sounds like when a plane lands. You hear the chirps and beeps of phones turning on and snippets of conversation starting before the aircraft wheels have even touched the ground. ""YES, MOM, WE JUST LANDED."" ""I'LL MEET YOU AT BAGGAGE CLAIM 12. NO CLAIM 12! I'M HERE! WHERE'S THE PARTY?"" If I still haven't convinced you, then consider the flight crews who will be forced to referee any cell phone disputes. Despite what travelers may think, flight attendants are not there to help you with your bags or serve you drinks. They are actually there to ensure your safety on your flight. Safety could be compromised if flight attendants are too busy refereeing -- or not -- people who are fighting about loud conversations all around them. Passengers are already on edge these days as civility in travel seems to have diminished greatly. Allowing the use of cell phones on flights will push us all closer to the cliff of our sanity. So here's hoping the airlines and related aviation groups fire up their public relations machines to squash this idea and instead, urge the FCC to continue the inflight cell phone ban. And travelers -- enjoy the down time. Listen to a podcast. Enjoy some music. Watch an in-flight movie. Play a game. The calls will be waiting for you when you land. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benét J. Wilson.","FCC is considering rules to allow the use of cell phone during flights .
Benet Wilson: Letting passengers talk nonstop would be like being stuck in hell .

"(CNN) -- In June 2004, at the age of 85, and five years after stepping down as South Africa's president, Nelson Mandela announced he was ""retiring from retirement"" to spend more time with family and friends, telling journalists, ""Don't call me, I'll call you."" As a globally recognized ambassador for a multiracial South Africa, the conscience of his continent and an inspiration for strugglers against oppression everywhere, Mandela was never going to be allowed to fade quietly into the history books. After leaving office, Mandela continued to lend his tireless support to the fight against social injustice and poverty in South Africa and beyond through fundraising organizations such as the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund. Persevering with diplomatic efforts he had initiated in government, Mandela worked patiently to mediate in conflict-stricken Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mandela, who died Thursday, also brought charisma, charm and enthusiasm to South Africa's successful bid for the 2010 World Cup, lobbying hard for the tournament to be awarded to an African nation for the first time. Comfortable retirement may have mellowed Mandela, but the instincts of the freedom fighter and anti-establishment activist still burned strongly. In early 2003, he spoke out harshly against the imminent U.S. invasion of Iraq, accusing U.S. President George W. Bush of ""wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust,"" adding ""if there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America."" In particular, Mandela became an outspoken advocate of efforts to tackle South Africa's worsening HIV and AIDS epidemic, criticizing his presidential successor and longtime ANC comrade Thabo Mbeki in 2002 for his government's prevarication in combating the disease. ""This is a war. It has killed more people than has been the case in all previous wars and in all previous natural disasters,"" Mandela said. ""We must not continue to be debating, to be arguing, when people are dying."" Mandela also set up the HIV/AIDS charity 46664 -- named after Mandela's prison number during his long incarceration on Robben Island -- inviting stars such as Bono and Beyonce to perform at a fundraising concert in Cape Town in 2003. Mandela had personal reasons for promoting the fight against HIV/AIDS. In 2005, he announced that his son, Makgatho Mandela, had died of an AIDS-related illness at the age of 54. ""Let us give publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like TB, like cancer, is always to come out and to say somebody has died because of HIV/AIDS -- and people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary,"" Mandela said. Mandela had endured health problems of his own, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001, but, he remained active throughout his 80s and continued to travel the world. In 2007, he formed The Elders, a group of widely respected former statesmen and world leaders dedicated to bringing their expertise, experience and moral authority to bear on the world's most pressing political and social issues. Members included Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter . In 2008, Mandela made his final trip abroad, traveling to London for a concert celebrating his approaching 90th birthday and marking the 20th anniversary of the city's iconic ""Free Nelson Mandela"" concert. Mandela celebrated his birthday at home in Qunu, delivering a simple message drawing attention to the continuing gap between rich and poor in South Africa: ""Poverty has gripped our people. If you are poor, you are not likely to live long."" In an interview with Graca Machel to mark the occasion, Machel told CNN her husband's only regret was that he hadn't had the chance to raise his children and spend more time with his loved ones. On the day in 2004 when South Africa won the right to host the 2010 World Cup, Mandela, a keen sports fan whose support for the Springboks at the 1995 Rugby World Cup was seen as a defining moment in the birth of the post-apartheid ""Rainbow Nation,"" summed up his excitement by saying he ""felt like a boy of 15."" Apartheid was a policy of segregation and discrimination that aimed to keep black and white apart in every sphere of life. But the eagerly anticipated tournament brought private tragedy for Mandela's family when his 13-year-old great-granddaughter, Zenani Mandela, was killed in a car accident while returning from a concert on the eve of the opening match. Mandela made a last public appearance at the World Cup final, smiling and waving to football fans at Johannesburg's Soccer City on July 11, 2010. To the end of his life, Mandela remained loyally committed to the African National Congress, appearing on stage with party leader Jacob Zuma in 2009 during his successful campaign for the presidency. Most of all, Mandela remained committed to the principle of dialogue -- and the belief, based on his own experiences, that even the most intractable problems could only be solved by enemies sitting down around a table to talk to each other.","Nelson Mandela pushed issues on the world's stage .

"(CNN) -- The audio recordings of 911 calls from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting will be released Wednesday afternoon, after a state attorney dropped his attempt to block the disclosure. State Attorney Stephen Sedensky, whose office conducted an investigation into the shocking mass shooting, said Monday he was withdrawing an appeal of a decision by the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission to release the calls. Sedensky said he discussed his decision with attorneys for the Connecticut town and lawyers from the office of the chief state's attorney. The release of the recordings will be administered by the attorneys for the Town of Newtown, Sedensky said through a written statement. Last week, Connecticut Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott upheld the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission's ruling to release calls related to the December 2012 shooting. The Associated Press had challenged authorities' refusal to release the 911 tapes. The calls are scheduled to be made public at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. Sedensky's office issued a 44-page report last week that concluded the shooter was a mentally ill recluse who never gave any indication that he was planning to kill people. Sandy Hook killer took motive to his grave . The massacre at Sandy Hook left 26 people dead, including 20 children, making it the second-deadliest shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Adam Lanza, shot himself at the end of his 11-minute rampage. The killings in Newtown, about 60 miles outside New York, happened less than five months after a similar bloodbath at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, outside Denver. Those mass slayings triggered a nationwide debate over gun violence, school safety and mental health, a debate that produced some new restrictions on firearms in several states. A backlash against those laws by gun-rights advocates followed, and there was only limited action on a federal level after a Republican filibuster blocked expanded background checks for gun buyers. CNN's Yon Pomrenze and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","State attorney drops appeal of court's decision to release the recordings .

"(CNN) -- Samsung tablets have edged out iPads for the first time in JD Power's biannual customer-satisfaction survey, although some observers say the results don't quite add up. Samsung topped JD Power's rankings with a score of 835 out of 1,000, narrowly beating out Apple's 833. Amazon was third in customer satisfaction at 826, followed by Asus and Acer. The rankings are based on the experiences of 3,375 tablet owners who responded between March and August of this year, and don't include the new iPad Air and iPad Mini, which went on sale Friday. But some tech pundits questioned the market-research company's scoring system. Survey respondents scored Apple's iPad higher than Samsung's tablets in four of five categories -- performance, ease of operation, styling/design, and features -- while Samsung scored higher in just one: cost. A Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 with an almost 8-inch screen, Wi-Fi-only connectivity and 16GB of storage sells for $299, compared to $399 for a comparable iPad Mini. ""Reporters who got their hands on the attached chart were left scratching their heads,"" wrote Philip Elmer DeWitt in Fortune. ""The only category that Samsung beat Apple in was (duh) cost. And cost, according to Power's press release, counts for at most 16% of the total score."" ""Did J.D. Power overreach in giving its top customer satisfaction nod to Samsung instead of Apple?"" wondered Don Reisinger of CNET. ""So who's the real winner?"" JD Power did not immediately respond Friday to CNN's request for comment. Apple in the past has trumpeted JD Power's rankings as evidence of its products' popularity with consumers. At the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple CEO Tim Cook bragged that iOS devices have won nine consecutive JD Power awards. JD Power's survey notes that Samsung is the only manufacturer to improve across all five categories since its last survey in April. The survey found that before buying their tablet, 50% of consumers rely on recommendations from friends, family members or colleagues, while 49% gather information from the manufacturer's website. Other factors that determine tablet-buying choices include brand reputation (42%) and past experience with the brand (32%).","Samsung tablets edged out iPads in JD Power's new customer-satisfaction survey .

"(CNN) -- If you've been hearing the spin, the only reason to watch the inevitable train wreck of the upcoming debates would be to see just how inept both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are at debating. And that spin is self-criticism. Their own campaigns would have us believe that these two candidates can't piece together a complete sentence between the two of them. But I'm here to tell you: It ain't so. These are two of the better presidential debaters we've witnessed, and I'm anticipating excellent debates. If you haven't watched Obama, I can assure you that he more than held his own four years ago in the debates against John McCain. And if you haven't seen Romney, then take my word for it. He debated poorly in only two of his (almost 20) debates this past year. His game is consistently solid. Opinion: The mistakes candidates make in debates . Romney's strengths: . -- Smooth. He's a real smooth smoothie. He can answer questions and present his arguments and make it look like child's play. After all, Romney bested Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, the Ricks (Santorum and Perry, although Perry is no Michael Phelps of debating) and the rest of the Republican candidates. If Romney could get through that minefield, he should be ready for Obama. -- Knowledgeable. There were simply no debates where I thought Romney didn't have a firm grasp of the issue being debated at the time. He knows his stuff. Don't expect him falling prey to any gotcha moments. -- Excellent front lines. His first lines of answers and opinions on every subject were outstanding. He'll be prepared. Count on it. -- Backward-step-pivot-forward. Romney is masterful at this. He defends his position well (backward-step), but then takes a potential weakness and turns it into a strength (pivot-forward). A great historical example demonstrating this technique was from Ronald Reagan. When people were worried about him becoming president at his advanced age, he famously stated in a debate against Walter Mondale that, ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" Yeah, The Gipper understood the pivot-forward, and so does Romney. Opinion: When candidates said 'no' to debates . Obama's strengths: . -- Detachment. It's one quality that made him seem so presidential in the debates four years back. Obama didn't take it personally when his policy ideas were attacked, and this helped build him convey strong character. -- Presence. He never let McCain rattle him. He came across, in every debate, as presidential. And poll after poll demonstrates the importance of poise in these debates. By the way, that includes when your opponent is speaking. Remaining in control of verbal and nonverbal communication at all times was a big strength of Obama's four years ago. He exuded a presidential quality. Opinion: How Obama can win the debate . -- Focus and crystallize. My old debate coach always taught me to crystallize and go back to the major premise. Obama was excellent in the McCain debates because he kept the focus on the economy. It might not be the economy this time, but Obama will find his issue to highlight and stick to it. -- Reasoning. Whatever he lacked in the McCain debates from experience, he made up for in sound arguments. In all the debates from four years ago, neither Obama nor McCain (nor Joe Biden for that matter -- did I leave anyone out?) came across as unfit intellectually to become president. While I expect a good performance from both candidates, they've not been mistake free in previous debates. Romney's weaknesses: . -- Smooth. He's a real smooth smoothie. Wait, what? Yeah, I said it was a strength, but it's also one of his biggest flaws. Ever heard the phrase ""Slick Mitt?"" Sometimes Romney comes across too polished. Almost fake. Watch for him to do two things that drive me crazy. The first is his awkward smile he projects at the end of his answers (or during his opponent's speeches). The second is when he says ""thank you"" at the end of his answers. He misunderstands the format. He'll be all heated, telling us why (Obama in this case) is a poor president, and then he'll end with ""thank you."" Huh? I thought you were angry until you blurted out ""thank you."" To me, this demonstrates insincerity. He's not answering the question, or debating his opponent. Instead, he's practicing his speeches. It's professional and polished, yes. But that's precisely what makes it impersonal and inappropriate for a debating format. I'm all for good manners, but in this case, ""thank you"" is noticeably out of place. Say it only at the end of the debate, after your closing argument. Opinion: Debate is Romney's chance to rally . -- Debating from behind in the polls. When trailing in the polls, it's imperative to put your opponent on the defensive. Romney waited until Florida to do this in the Republican debates when he should have done it sooner. He was debating ""not to lose,"" but that's only an effective strategy for the front-runner. -- Extensions/second line of defense. This might have been Romney's greatest weakness. When pressed beyond his original answers on many topics, he simply couldn't defend himself effectively. iReport: 10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate . Obama's weaknesses: . -- Detachment. Wait, what? Tricked you again. But it's true. Obama sometimes appears dispassionate in debates. And with our economy still recovering, this lack of passion may distance him from the audience. -- Slow, stuttering approach. I'll admit that four years ago, I hadn't heard Obama speak in any debates. And his speech in general was quite awkward -- containing so many pauses that I thought I was back in time, sitting on the divan listening to my grandfather slowly spin his yarns while the phonograph quietly played in the background. I didn't like his speaking style then, (Obama's, not grandpa's) and I haven't changed my mind over the past four years. While these canyon-sized pauses might assist in conveying a thoughtful approach, they often give the opposite signal ... that he doesn't know what he wants to say next. Obama's slow, stuttering speech doesn't showcase well in debates. -- Long-winded answers. Obama never mastered sound bites and clips. Unfortunately, these debates have the tendency to be nothing but a series of sound bites, and that doesn't play to the president's hand. His extended answers sound like lectures. And nobody likes to be lectured, especially in a long-winded fashion. Enjoy the debates. And oh, I almost forgot. ""Thank you."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Campaigns are spinning but know that Romney, Obama are good debaters .
On Romney's strengths: He's smooth, knowledgeable, good at pivoting from questions .
On Obama's strengths: Stays cool, strong presence, good focus and reasoning .
Graham: Both have weaknesses that are flip sides of strengths; expect a good debate ."
"(CNN) -- When it comes to social media's heavy hitters, there are no bigger players than Facebook or Twitter, right? Not if you're in South Africa. Mobile network Mxit claims to have nearly 10 million users in the country, making it South Africa's most popular social media platform by far, eclipsing Facebook's six million users and Twitter's 1.1 million subscribers. Founded seven years ago by Namibian-born software developer Herman Heunis, Mxit has grown from an instant messaging application into a global mobile social network. The handset-agnostic network is tapping Africa's booming mobile market to serve a growing community of users and developers. Mxit users can chat with their contacts, exchange photos and use a digital currency to buy virtual goods, while aspiring entrepreneurs can find a large audience for their applications and services. Speaking to CNN before his recent resignation from the business he bought in September 2011, former CEO Alan Knott-Craig said he was still astonished by the power of mobile and how engaged the millions of Mxit users are. ""Firstly they're looking to meet people, secondly they're looking for attention, they want to be heard or want to be seen,"" said Knott-Craig. ""And lastly, people are looking to have fun, they're looking for entertainment and there's only one thing in their life: the cell phone -- there's no iPad, PC, XBox or TV, there's just the phone and Mxit is that escape."" The company says its users transfer between 500 and 850 million messages every day. That's roughly double the number of tweets sent daily on a global basis. The average user now spends 85 minutes a week using Mxit and logs on up to four times a day. Knott-Craig says the statistics prove that the growing popularity of mobile internet has transformed the way people communicate across Africa. ""Before mobile Africa really was a dark continent -- I mean literally people couldn't communicate,"" Knott-Craig explained. He added: ""In South Africa 17 years ago, before mobile phones came along, there were five million phones out of a population of 35 million people. Now there are 60 million phones out of a population of 60 million people. ""So literally, with the advent of mobile, it's gone from almost a billion people not being able to talk to anyone except those they see, to being able to talk to anyone regardless of where they are. ""So that's the first revolution. We have no legacy. No existing cable operator or TV player or ADSL -- there's nothing, there's just mobile. ""The other thing is the fact that credit cards are just non-existent. You'll never build a big business by billing people via credit cards in Africa and probably in all emerging markets, and again that problem is being solved within an African context by trying to build the systems to sell prepaid airtime. ""Mobile succeeded in that because it unlocks the communications grid of the continent. The next step is to unlock the economic grid via mobile payments."" So how does Mxit make money? Its primary revenue isn't generated through advertising, which is unusual compared to other social networks. Instead it makes most of its money by selling content to its users. The site acts as a marketplace for hundreds of millions of micro-payments using its digital currency, Moola. Around 13% of active users are spenders and use Moola to buy skinz, wallpapers, games and music. Read also: Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . ""We make money in the same way that Facebook makes money, which is basically advertising and content, except we do it in an inverse ratio,"" said Knott-Craig. ""I think they make 90% of their money from advertising and 10% from content -- we make 70% of our money from selling third-party developer content, and 30% from advertising."" Knott-Craig stepped down as CEO in October 2012, citing a difference of opinion with shareholders. ""While the shareholders and I share the same vision, we differ on how to get there,"" he said in a statement. But although he's left the company, Knott-Craig has described Mxit as Africa's biggest tech success story -- and one he believes will continue to grow. ""You can build a big global tech company out of Africa. It doesn't have to come out of San Francisco and I didn't know that before because I hadn't seen that before,"" he said. Claire Brennan contributed to this report.","Mxit is South Africa's most popular social media platform .

"Boston (CNN) -- An FBI official assigned to Boston to clean up corruption in the 1980s testified Tuesday he was overruled by his superiors when he suggested decades ago that James ""Whitey"" Bulger be shut down as an FBI informant. ""They didn't do it. I didn't like it, but there was nothing I could do about it,"" said Robert Fitzpatrick, the former assistant special-agent-in-charge of the Boston office, who testified his bosses at FBI headquarters in Washington ""felt Bulger was the person who was going to bring down the Mafia."" Prosecutors have charged Bulger with participating in 19 murders in a 32-count indictment that also accuses the alleged Boston Irish mob boss of racketeering, money laundering, and extortion during some two decades. Defense witness testifies Bulger didn't seem much of an informant . During that time, according to previous testimony from a disgraced former FBI agent, Bulger was also an FBI informant instrumental in the takedown of the New England Mafia, La Cosa Nostra. Fitzpatrick, who was in charge of the drug task force in the organized crime squad, said he was not more forceful in pushing to cut off Bulger as an informant because of the FBI's ""quasi-military"" structure, saying it would have been a ""violation of protocol"" to take his concerns any higher. He testified that his recommendation on Bulger came after a 30-minute meeting in which Bulger did most of the talking. Even though he was the second-highest-ranking agent in Boston at the time, Fitzpatrick played down the scope of his authority, suggesting he was undermined by Bulger's FBI handlers, apparently unaware at the time that they were being paid off by Bulger. But Fitzpatrick testified Monday that during the 30-minute meeting, Bulger indicated that the FBI wasn't paying him, but that he was paying the FBI. Asked why he didn't investigate the alleged bribery, Fitzpatrick said, ""It could just be a pay-off ... no quid pro quo."" Prosecutor Brian Kelly suggested Fitzpatrick was not interested in shutting down a bad informant: ""Weren't you more concerned about your own bureaucratic career than rocking the boat?"" Trying to discredit Fitzpatrick's story, Kelly read passages from his book, ""Betrayal,"" in which the former agent recounts events at which he was not present. Kelly accused him of creating ""an entire imaginary conversation with James Bulger,"" and smirked at the notion Fitzgerald ""taunted"" the reputed crime boss. Although the book is portrayed as ""absolutely true,"" its copyright page lists it as ""fiction."" On the stand, Fitzpatrick described it as a ""memoir, a recitation of things"" he believes happened. His goal, he said, was to expose corruption in the FBI, which is also, he says, why he resigned: ""I didn't want to be part of the corruption."" During cross-examination Tuesday, Fitzpatrick had difficulty remembering his testimony from the previous day. ""Do you have trouble with your memory?"" the prosecutor asked. ""Not that I recall,"" answered Fitzpatrick, drawing some quick laughs from the court. Bulger's defense attorneys called Fitzpatrick as part of their attempt to highlight corruption within the FBI during the 1970s and '80s. Another witness testified that rogue FBI agent John Connolly had access to all FBI informant files and therefore to the identities of everyone cooperating with the government. One of them was alleged Bulger crime associate Brian Halloran. Fitzpatrick previously testified he went to strike force attorneys requesting the Justice Department be more diligent about putting Halloran in witness protection. Halloran was cooperating with law enforcement and had implicated Bulger in the murder of a wealthy Oklahoma business man. Two days later, Fitzpatrick testified, Halloran was shot to death. Bulger's former associate Kevin Weeks previously testified that Bulger fired a machine gun in the hit, along with another shooter. Pointing to Judge Mark Wolf's portrait in court, Kelly argued that in 1988, during hearings before Wolf, Fitzpatrick could not recall going to the Justice Department to help get Halloran in witness protection. The prosecutor also zeroed in on a passage in the memoir in which Fitzpatrick suggests he was present in 2000 when the body of another alleged Bulger victim, John McIntyre, was pulled from the ""frozen ground."" Despite writing that the image was ""etched in my memory,"" Fitzpatrick couldn't recall whether he was actually there. Fitzpatrick was not working for the FBI at the time McIntyre's remains were exhumed in 2000. ""You were trying to take credit for something you didn't do,"" Kelley said. The prosecution alleges Bulger ordered a hit on McIntyre, a fisherman, after learning that McIntyre was cooperating with law enforcement on the investigation of a shipment of arms Bulger intended to send to the Irish Republican Army on the fishing trawler Valhalla. McIntyre also tipped authorities to a 36-ton delivery of marijuana on the boat Ramsland in 1984, months before he was killed, prosecutors say. Developer describes threats in trial . Kelly brandished documents in court that showed Fitzpatrick vouched for rogue FBI agents during the same time he claims he complained about their behavior. Fitzpatrick apparently signed off on glowing FBI evaluations of disgraced and now-jailed Connolly, and even signed off on a recommendation for him to go to a Harvard program. On redirect questioning, Fitzpatrick defended his book to the jury. ""The book is about the criminal justice system,"" he said. ""In my estimation the criminal justice system failed, it failed during this whole situation. I wanted to bring it to light, not just for the public, for my family."" Fitzpatrick, who is still fighting to receive the full amount of his pension, plans to write another book on this trial, he said in court. Jury will not be sequestered . Despite a request by the defense, Judge Denise Casper decided Tuesday not to sequester the jury, saying this late in the trial the jury was unprepared, and it could be prejudicial to both sides to have a disgruntled jury. Defense attorney J.W. Carney previously argued that there has ""never been a more widely publicized or sensational case in this district,"" saying there has been saturated media coverage and ""statements that are so hyperbolic and prejudicial towards the defendant ... unlike anything anyone has seen."" The judge said her initial instructions to the jury have been reinforced ""more importantly by my repeatedly advising them that they not pay attention to media accounts."" She also said she does not expect a ""great amount of coverage during deliberations."" ""We have to assume the jurors are following my instructions,"" she said Tuesday morning. ""I am not inclined to inconvenience these jurors at this juncture,"" she said, particularly when they have had ""no notice"" of the potential of sequestration. The defense has so far called two of its estimated 15 witnesses. It took the prosecution 30 days and 63 witnesses to present its case, which it wrapped up Friday.","Former FBI agent says he wanted Bulger cut off, but there was nothing he could do .
The prosecutor uses the former agent's book to challenge his version of events .
The defense attorney's request for sequestration is denied .

"London (CNN) -- He's brought bloodthirsty zombies, squalid junkies and murderous housemates to life on the big screen, but faced the toughest task of his career at London 2012: bringing boogying nurses, bucolic scenes and butterflies on bicycles to a worldwide audience of a billion people. Danny Boyle, the Oscar-winning director -- and east London resident -- best known for hit movies ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was the man responsible for the Olympic opening ceremony, the show that televisions around the world were tuned in to at the start of London's long-awaited Games. And while those of his films set in Britain have painted a darkly comic picture of the country, ""Isles of Wonder"" -- the ""Tempest""-inspired extravaganza which kicked off the Games -- proved much more of a celebration of the nation. Live blog: Let the games begin . A billion people across the globe tuned in for the three-hour, $42.4m show, which featured 10,000 adult volunteers, 900 children, 12 horses, 10 chickens, nine geese, three cows and a flock of sheep. With an uplifting, ""people power"" theme combining references to British history and pop culture, the rambunctious ceremony covered subjects as diverse as the Industrial Revolution, the National Health Service, popular children's book characters including Peter Pan and Mary Poppins, and pop stars past and present. It was well received in the United Kingdom and abroad, drawing an average audience of 40.7 million people in the US, topping the previous record of 39.8 million for the 1996 Atlanta Games. ""The Ceremony is an attempt to capture a picture of ourselves as a nation, where we have come from and where we want to be,"" Boyle explained in a statement in the run-up to the Games, saying he hoped to tell the country's story, with the help of a vast army of volunteers who, he said, ""are the purest embodiment of the Olympic spirit and represent the best of who we are as a nation."" ""We have to celebrate all that is great about the past but also all the potential Britain has in the future,"" said British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""The difficulty is how do you cram in all that is great about our country, whether it is sport, art, literature, history, contribution to world events. I'm confident they have done a good job and there were one or two moments I was really moved by. There's something for everyone."" Opinion: Is Team USA's militaristic uniform a problem? Britons are known for their ability to laugh at themselves, and it appears Boyle sought to capitalize on this -- as The Economist noted recently, ""opening ceremonies are a country's opportunity to sell itself to the world. Britain appears to be selling irony."" Olympics organizers say that Boyle's experience, energy and unusual vision made him the perfect man for the job. ""His ability as a storyteller, as a creator of spectacle, his background in both theater and film and the passion he has for this city and this project -- they all just screamed at us,"" said Bill Morris, director of Ceremonies for the London Games, when Boyle was appointed to the role. ""It wasn't a difficult choice."" ""Danny gets this,"" London 2012 Chairman Sebastian Coe told CNN back in 2010. ""He gets the Olympic Games, he gets sports, he lives in London, he's a stone's throw from the Olympic Park, and it was just such an obvious fit."" It was not always thus: Boyle, 55, was born into a working-class family in Manchester, northern England, the son of a power plant worker and a cafeteria employee, and as a child had hoped to become a Catholic priest. But after a school trip to see a much-lauded Royal Shakespeare Company performance of ""Richard II,"" and a visit to the cinema with classmates to see Stanley Kubrick's controversial ""A Clockwork Orange,"" his ambitions turned instead to film and theater. Boyle studied English and drama at university, before working at the RSC and at London's innovative Royal Court Theatre, where he was deputy director in the 1980s. He moved into television, and then on to movies, making his big screen debut with ""Shallow Grave,"" the darkly humorous tale of three flatmates who discover a suitcase full of cash when their new lodger dies of a drug overdose. Despite being made on a shoestring budget -- Boyle is reported to have said the team behind it were forced to sell off furniture to buy film stock when the $1.55m budget began to run short -- ""Shallow Grave"" became Britain's biggest grossing film of 1995, earning $20m worldwide, as well as a string of positive reviews. He followed it up with ""Trainspotting"" (1996) the critically-acclaimed story of a group of Edinburgh heroin addicts, which launched the careers of Ewan McGregor, Kelly Macdonald (""Boardwalk Empire"") and Kevin McKidd (""Grey's Anatomy""), and was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as ""a visionary knockout spiked with insight, wild invention and outrageous wit."" London welcomes world for Olympics opening ceremony . Its success -- the movie, which had cost just $2m to make, earned $72m -- prompted a move towards Hollywood, but Boyle's career faltered with his first two big-budget projects, ""A Life Less Ordinary,"" and ""The Beach,"" and he briefly returned to television in the UK, before making his movie comeback with 2002's post-apocalyptic zombie flick ""28 Days Later."" He then changed tone, directing the more family-orientated family feature ""Millions,"" (2004) about two brothers who find a stash of pound notes only days before the UK is set to switch its currency to the euro. Five years later, he scooped the Oscar for Best Director when ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the story of a poor Indian teenager who wins a TV gameshow, swept the board at the 2009 Academy Awards. And it is the uplifting, life-affirming mood of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" that the director brought to the opening ceremony, because despite the dark subject matter of many of his films, and his recent return to theater with a rapturously-received production of Frankenstein, Boyle insists he remains positive, an optimist. Speaking in 2010, he said: ""I want it to feel like a very genuine expression of the welcome to the athletes and to the Games of the city, and especially from east London."" As the athletes launch into competition in venues around his home, his ceremony's combination of novelty, national pride and nuttiness seems to have accomplished exactly that.

"(CNN) -- There's a man defecating on my desk. He's Spanish. But, sadly, it's not Rafa Nadal. For surely that might count, then, as an oddly spectacular life moment worth Instagramming. Thanks, Rafa! #Deuce . No, the squatting Spanish defecator I speak of is actually a three-inch-tall plastic figurine known as a Caganer. I bought it a while back in Barcelona, and, believe it or not, he's a traditional fixture in Catalan nativity scenes, which, apparently, are inspired by parking lots at Philadelphia Eagles games. So, I keep my little Caganer near my computer because it makes me smile. But I also just like having interesting desk toys, even though it seems I've clearly been missing out on the single greatest one of all. You see, this week the interwebs suddenly started buzzing about a very specific desk toy called Buckyballs. I had never actually heard of these things, but online chatter went a little crazy right after the company announced they were discontinuing production of their hugely popular and addictive shape-changing magnetic beads. If you're not quite sure what I'm talking about, just think stress ball meets marbles meets Silly Putty... ...meets possible agonizing pain. Magnetic Buckyballs toys discontinued . Amazingly, while everyone from WIRED to MAXIM to The New York Times has boasted about these tiny little magnetic balls of joy, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has basically deemed them to be just slightly less dangerous than trying to administer a hernia test to an unwilling gorilla. In fact, this past July, in their official lawsuit against the makers of Buckyballs, the commission noted that the magnets ""contain a defect in the design, packaging, warnings and instructions which pose a substantial risk of injury to the public."" It turns out kids like shiny things. And sometimes they swallow shiny things. But when those shiny things happen to be superpowerful magnets, it's actually a fairly serious health concern. Many retailers voluntarily stopped selling Buckyballs at the safety commission's request, but the distributor, Maxfield & Oberton Holdings, continued to manufacture and sell the product. Until Wednesday. That's when Buckyballs put out this statement: . ""Due to baseless and relentless legal badgering by a certain four letter government agency, it's time to bid a fond farewell to the world's most popular adult desk toys, Buckyballs and Buckycubes. That's right: We're sad to say that Balls & Cubes have a one-way ticket to the Land-of-Awesome-Stuff-You-Should-Have-Bought-When-You-Had-the-Chance."" Buckyball supporters were furious. Now I feel their pain. Because these things are amazing! While writing this, I decided to step away from my work and scour the newsroom to see if anyone actually had Buckyballs. I wanted to test them out, but -- truth be told -- I also can't concentrate for more than 30 seconds at a time. So, I figured I might as well walk around and distract my co-workers. The logical first stop was Topher's desk, because his cubicle always seems to have a certain level of ""flair."" Unfortunately, since Buckyballs have nothing to do with ""Star Wars"" he didn't have any -- lest they disrupt the delicate feng shui of his Darth Vader shrine. ""You have failed me for the last time, Topher."" Fortunately, his desk neighbor, Michelle, DID have Buckyballs! However, she wasn't in the office yet, so I couldn't just politely borrow them for an hour. Thus, I politely stole them. Walking around the newsroom with this small mass of tiny round magnets was like coming to work with a puppy. Everyone wanted to hold it, and I watched seemingly mature adults delightfully morph into whimsical children, completely in awe of this strange, invisible force. For as the great American poets, Insane Clown Posse, once asked, ""(Expletive) magnets -- how do they work?"" Cute as it may have been to watch my colleagues smiling like little kids, the irony is that it's real children who have brought Buckyballs to their end. Despite the fact that, since 2010, there have been warning labels in five places on each box, and additional inserts specifically instructing adults to keep these far, far away from kids (you know, like poison or guns or that one creepy neighbor who always brags about once being on ""Dateline""), Buckyballs are still being swallowed. So, the debate rages online: Was it right for the government to go after Buckyballs, or has the company properly done its due diligence to warn and protect consumers? It's sort of a moot point since, at least for now, what they have in stock is all that's left. Though, I suppose you could always just politely steal them from Michelle's desk.","The makers of Buckyballs are discontinuing them because of safety concerns .

"(CNN) -- The eyes of the gaming world are on Sony, which on Wednesday is expected to unveil the PlayStation 4, the latest version of its popular gaming console. It's been more than six years since the company launched its PlayStation 3. That's an eon in the warp-speed tech industry, and the company faces a drastically altered landscape as it enters a new round of battles with its top competitors: Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's Wii (and, now, the Wii U). Long gone are the days when gamers had to pop into their local game shop for the latest titles. PC gaming, Web streaming and smartphone and tablet games have all sapped the popularity of the venerable living-room console. In this new era of mobile, connected gaming, experts say faster processors and flashier specs won't be enough for the next generation. ""If you look at where the market is headed, it's clear that Sony needs to acknowledge that the traditional console business is dead,"" said Dan ""Shoe"" Hsu, editor-in-chief of gaming site GamesBeat. ""There will still be some room for big-budget, disc-based games sold at retail stores, sure. But mobile, free-to-play and social are huge in gaming, and the next PlayStation needs to accommodate those sectors."" Still beloved among its legions of dedicated gamers, Sony has some work to do if it is to leapfrog back to the top of the gaming heap. Its PlayStation 2, which was released in 2000, is the top-selling gaming console of all time with more than 150 million sold. The PS3 has held its own but is not believed to have come even close to that number, with estimates hovering around 77 million. That's been enough to keep the console neck and neck with Microsoft (which is rumored to be developing its own next-generation console, the Xbox 720) but trailing Nintendo's Wii, which has parlayed its wide appeal with family and casual gamers into the top spot since hitting the market in 2006. The success of the Wii, which let players manipulate in-game avatars by moving their bodies, spawned similar motion-controlled systems in 2010 from Microsoft (Kinect) and Sony (Move). But in 2013, with the motion-control craze on the wane, Sony may sense a new opening. Sales of the Wii U, released in November, have stumbled out of the blocks as gamers continue processing the system's multiscreen setup. Observers like Hsu say that will take a sales pitch that appeals to how today's gamer plays as much as, or more than, how the new system performs. ""Sony needs to show its next system is ready for the future, and this includes some crossover play with smartphones, digital distribution, cloud storage to help minimize the need for physical media and a free-to-play ecosystem that can bring in new gamers,"" he said. ""Pure horsepower will be less important this time around."" The inevitable flood of rumors about this week's announcement suggests that may be on Sony's mind as well. The new console will have the ability to stream online games, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Unnamed sources say the tech will be used to let players play older PS3 games on the new console as well as new ones. Last year, Sony bought Gakai, a cloud-based gaming company that let PC gamers stream top games via broadband. Images of what are claimed to be prototypes of the PlayStation 4's controllers have leaked and appear to show a ""Share"" button, suggesting that social-sharing options will be baked into the system. And Sony has begun slashing prices on its handheld Vita gaming system, starting in Japan, leading some to speculate that there could be mobile integration in the PS4. Of course, like Nintendo and especially Microsoft, Sony wants to continue branding its console as an entertainment hub for the living room, not just a gaming toy. Sony is rumored to be developing its own online TV service to compete with cable, something it would feature heavily on a new PlayStation. PlayStation already has streaming-media apps like Netflix, Amazon Instant and Hulu. Gamers will be looking for all that and more. But, as some observers note, all of the extras will have to branch out from a very important home base. ""The PlayStation 3 has matured into a fantastic gaming system,"" wrote CNET's Jeff Bakalar. ""Sony must maintain this luxury into the next generation. For all the extracurricular bells and whistles this system will boast, gamers still want to play great games that you can't experience anywhere else. Exclusive games sell systems first.""","The eyes of the gaming world this week are on Sony, expected to unveil PlayStation 4 .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for American Airlines and US Airways to merge into world's largest airline company. Late Saturday night, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg declined to hear a stay request filed by a consumer group opposing the merger. Earlier in the day, a federal appeals court in New York also denied an emergency stay -- which prompted the consumer group to turn to the Supreme Court to block the deal. The passenger group believes that a merger will result in higher fares and reduced choices for fliers. With the Supreme Court removing the last roadblock, the two airlines can sign papers before the financial markets open Monday. For the foreseeable future, though, passengers will still be booking flights under both the American Airlines and US Airways names. Details about when the airlines will combine reservations and ticketing, frequent flier clubs and other operations are still being worked out, and those combinations are not likely until the beginning of 2014, at the earliest. But the combined company will be the largest airline in the world in terms of revenue, passengers carried and the number of miles flown by paying passengers, surpassing United Continental Holdings, which was also formed by a merger. CNN's Supreme Court producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg declined to hear a stay request .

"(CNN) -- A California husband and father became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty in the agency's 12-year history, the lone fatality in a frightful shooting at Los Angeles International Airport. Gerardo Hernandez would have celebrated his 40th birthday next week. Instead, he is being mourned as the first slain-on-duty officer at the Transportation Security Administration, a sometimes loathed but always vital agency that protects the country's airports. ""I am truly devastated,"" his widow Ana Hernandez said of the man she described as a ""wonderful husband, father, brother, son and friend."" ""We are all heartbroken and will miss him dearly."" Contradicting reports that Hernandez was a behavior detection officer, TSA Administrator John Pistole said he had other duties.

"(CNN) -- Despite everything you may have read, seen or heard in the past few years, there are principles and policies that unite Americans rather than divide us. One of these is our belief in the golden rule -- especially when it comes to everyone's freedom to earn a living. It's a nearly universal belief among American voters that all people should be allowed to compete equitably for jobs and be judged only on their skills, experience and performance. In the coming weeks, the U.S. Senate is expected to vote on just this. Fortunately, there is overwhelming bipartisan momentum -- on Capitol Hill and out in the grassroots -- in favor of treating all employees the same. In a majority of states it is still perfectly legal to fire people solely based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. And nearly eight out of 10 voters mistakenly believe it is illegal under federal law to fire or refuse to hire someone because they are gay or transgender. Earlier this month, Project Right Side and Americans for Workplace Opportunity commissioned TargetPoint Consulting to conduct a survey to gauge voter support for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a bill that extends workplace protections to gay and transgender employees. The poll found strong bipartisan support for this legislation -- including that of a majority of Republicans. The poll interviewed 2,000 registered voters and was conducted September 3-8. Among voters nationwide, 68% support the protections offered by ENDA. Among Republican respondents, 56% backed ENDA. Such overwhelming support is a testament to the conservative values at the heart of the proposed law, which would ensure all hardworking Americans are treated the same -- that all are judged in the workplace based on their merits and performance -- nothing more, nothing less. In addition to the poll, we used a state-of-the-art modeling technique to estimate attitudes toward workplace protections in all 50 states. Our findings: A majority in every state favor a federal law protecting gay and transgender employees. Support rises above 60% in many states, including Arkansas, Arizona, New Hampshire, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Our polling found that 80% of voters believe that ""people shouldn't be fired from their jobs solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" while an even stronger 88% agreed that companies should ""hire and fire based solely on a person's qualifications not quotas."" These core beliefs are why so many of America's blue chip companies have long recognized the importance of fostering open workplaces. Nearly 90% of Fortune 500 companies have nondiscrimination policies covering sexual orientation, while nearly 60% have policies covering gender identity. Why? They do it because it is fundamentally the right thing to do, but their leaders will also tell you this allows them to be competitive in the labor market by attracting the best talent regardless of how they live their private lives. This isn't just smart policy -- it's also smart politics. Although many Republicans still struggle to embrace the freedom to marry, there is a clear consensus within the GOP that all Americans be protected in the workplace. An overwhelming majority of Republicans, 86%, believe ""everyone has a right to earn a living including gay, lesbian and transgender Americans."" Similarly, 86% of Republicans agree that ""we should all follow the Golden Rule and treat others as we'd like to be treated, including gay, lesbian and transgender Americans."" These, along with majority support for ENDA, underscore the vastness of the coalition supporting this important reform. Republicans are demonstrating leadership to ensure basic workplace protections for all Americans. Earlier this summer, Republican Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Orrin Hatch of Utah were part of a bipartisan vote that advanced ENDA out of committee and to the full Senate. Following the committee vote, Hatch said, ""I voted for it because it prohibits discrimination that should not occur in the workplace, it protects the rights of religious entities, and minimizes legal burdens on employers."" Treating others as we would like to be treated is a fundamental conservative value. This basic tenant of American life is at the heart of workplace protections that will build and strengthen both the country and our competitive enterprises. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Lundry.","Poll finds 80% of voters think nobody should be fired for being gay or transgender .

"(CNN) -- Roma became the first team in Serie A history to win its opening 10 games of the season after a 1-0 victory over bottom feeder Chievo, a result that also restored the Giallorossi's five-point advantage at the top of the table over Juventus and Napoli. Roma bossed possession -- amassing 65% overall -- but when the hour mark passed and the match remained scoreless it appeared as if Chievo would engineer an upset and take a point in the Eternal City. Club legend Francesco Totti couldn't bail out Roma, since he was out injured. Marco Borriello, however, struck in the 67th minute with a header to put an end to Chievo's resistance. Borriello's effort was one of 18 shots for Rudi Garcia's Roma, while Chievo only mustered two. Roma ground out a 1-0 win at Udinese on Sunday to make it nine in a row and match the feat of Juventus during the 2005/06 season. Juventus was later stripped of its title that campaign as part of a match-fixing scandal. Atletico keeps pace . Days after pledging his international future to Spain instead of Brazil -- the country of his birth -- Diego Costa scored again as Atletico Madrid beat Granada 2-1 to keep the pressure on Barcelona in La Liga. Costa moved ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo in the scoring charts on 12 goals when he converted a penalty in the first half and ex Barcelona front man David Villa also found the back of the net from the spot in the second half. Villa won both penalties. Granada pulled a goal back in injury time after Atletico's Filipe Luis was sent off in the 89th minute for a second yellow but Atletico hung on for a vital victory despite not playing at its best. ""What really makes me happy is the effort made by the players,"" Atletico manager Diego Simeone told the club website. ""It's not easy to win, win, win and keep winning."" Atletico improved to 30 points, one behind the Catalans, after improving to 10 wins and a defeat. Despite Lionel Messi's month-long scoring slump in the league, Barcelona beat city rival Celta Vigo 3-0 away on Tuesday to temporarily move four points ahead. Real Madrid completes the top three. In a hole following a Clasico defeat to Barcelona on Saturday, Ronaldo bagged a hat-trick and Gareth Bale scored his first goals at the Bernabeu in a 7-3 thrashing of Sevilla on Wednesday. Impasse continues in France . A strike by clubs from Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 moved ever closer after French President Francois Hollande refused to budge on plans to hit high earners with a hefty 75% tax rate for two years. A meeting with club owners did little to change Hollande's mind Thursday, meaning the teams look certain to sit out games between November 29 and December 2. The scheme, which could be implemented next year, was initiated to help reduce France's budget deficit although the clubs argue they're unfair targets since many of them are struggling financially. ""Club representatives have not been heard despite several constructive proposals,"" the Union of Professional Football Clubs said in a statement on its website. ""This tax, which was initially meant for the richest, will in our case impact companies in debt."" Those who earn more than 1 million euros ($1.38 million) a year would have to pay the 75% rate. But it's the clubs, not the players, who would have to cough up the funds.","Roma sets new record in Serie A by winning its 10th straight game to start season .

"(CNN) -- Which toys will make it into the National Toy Hall of Fame this year? Maybe the Magic 8 Ball, one of 12 finalists announced this week, has the answer. Each year, the National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, New York, recognizes toys that have ""engaged and delighted multiple generations, inspiring them to learn, create, and discover through play.""

"(CNN) -- Danish footballer Rasmus Ankersen had been looking forward to the new season. He was lining up for top division club FC Midtjylland, and at just 19 had been identified by coaches as having a bright future in the game. But after just 15 minutes of the first match of the season, he injured his anterior cruciate ligament and his career as a footballer was over before it had really begun. Now 30, Ankersen doesn't dwell on what might have been. Instead he has spent much of the last 11 years moving from coaching to researching and writing books to unravel the enigma of talent and potential: what turns someone from just good to great? ""Talent cannot be evaluated in a vacuum,"" he says. ""You need to talk about what is important and then you can talk about what talent is."" For those in the field of sports the margins between being a gold medal winner are tiny. Ankersen cites the movement away from the gut-instinct of scouts -- ""they only remember when they're right"" -- to measurable metrics, best shown in the 2011 Brad Pitt film ""Moneyball,"" as an industry-wide phenomenon aimed to find the very best. However, just pure number-crunching can be flawed if it is not done with clear goals and an element of objectivity, he suggests. ""(Outside of sports) the recruitment process has potential for becoming a lot more professional,"" he says. ""I think businesses are way too static, they look at resumes and certificates too much. ""If you speak to a business you'll have a hard time finding someone to explain why they are using the metrics they are using; they basically put an ad in a newspaper because that's what everyone else does. There's a lot of ass-covering."" To find the best, you go to the place where it the most difficult to demonstrate the skills you are looking for, believes Ankersen. As a consultant for a fashion company's recruitment department he prescribed some bitter medicine: no resumes could be looked at and no one could come from within the fashion industry. The results, he says, were positive, with new employees coming from a range of backgrounds. Others are looking to social media to help find the diamonds in the rough. Former Fox TV and Facebook employee Jordan Katz founded Create.it last year. What began as a platform for Red Bull to help recruit future surf and skateboard champions via peer-evaluated competitions is now branching out into other fields. ""We're looking at how technology can help improve efficiencies,"" says Katz. ""We're moving into the enterprise space to help hire employees, like identify on-air talent for TV networks or a barista at a cafe; they're all applicable."" Linked to Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and YouTube, the Red Bull campaigns invite skaters and surfers around the world to post videos of their skills and for others to rate them. A panel of coaches also chime in with their expert opinion. ""There's a filter layer,"" says Katz. ""So votes from non-friends are weighted more than friends or those within the candidates' social network. ""It also gets fans involved and lets the recruiters see the personalities and who are the most marketable."" The U.S. ski team used the platform last summer to try and help find members for its Olympic aerial skiing team beyond its normal demographic. It encouraged gymnasts, trampolinists and tumblers to send in videos and be rewarded with a place in a try out camp. While it seems an ideal platform for finding the next surf champion or super fan to become a company spokesperson, Katz maintains that is not just an elaborate popularity contest or brand extending exercise. ""You'll still have to interview a potential CEO, but this provides a platform to filter, a pre-qualifier before some of the more traditional methods,"" he says. ""We're creating a wider net that reduces the time to evaluate talent and gives people a chance to earn an opportunity."" Ultimately seizing that opportunity comes down to the candidate, be it a potential Olympian or gas pump attendant whose stellar service skills could be better used elsewhere. Hard work is a necessity in being a top sportsperson, and Ankersen believes that fundamental holds true for success in other fields. ""How many people get honest feedback or stretch themselves, set goals on a daily basis?"" asks Ankersen. ""Not many of us. The whole practice mindset is what sports do very well, but not in business.""","Danish footballer Rasmus Ankersen was forced to abandon his dreams of being a footballer after injury .

"(CNN) -- Supporters of Pfc. Bradley Manning, accused in the largest leak of classified documents in U.S. history, have adopted the phrase: ""I am Bradley Manning."" But who is Manning? A whistle-blower? Or someone who aided the enemy in the midst of war? Those and other questions go to trial Monday as Manning's court-martial is scheduled to begin at Maryland's Fort Meade. Gallery: Key WikiLeaks figures as trial begins . In February, Manning, 25, pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges against him and faces up to two decades in jail. He did not plead guilty to the most serious charge -- that of aiding the United States' enemies, which carries the potential for a life sentence. During the proceeding, Manning spent more than an hour reading a statement that detailed why and how he sent classified material to WikiLeaks, a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website. Manning said he passed on information that ""upset"" or ""disturbed"" him but didn't give WikiLeaks anything he thought would harm the United States if it were made public. ""I believed if the public was aware of the data, it would start a public debate of the wars,"" he told the court. The U.S. military first detained Manning in May 2010 for leaking U.S. combat video -- including a U.S. helicopter gunship attack posted on WikiLeaks -- and classified State Department cables. Manning was turned in by Adrian Lamo, a former hacker, whom Manning allegedly told about leaking the classified records. In his statement to the court, Manning said he initially contacted The Washington Post and The New York Times to provide information. He said he either wasn't taken seriously or got voice mail, so he gave the material to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information. On Saturday, Manning's supporters rallied outside Fort Meade. ""People came from great distances to stand with a true American hero,"" said Jeff Paterson, director of the Bradley Manning Support Network. ""From Bradley's demeanor in court, it's clear he takes strength from the outpouring of support."" Manning was formally charged in February 2012. On the eve of the court-martial, his lawyer, David Coombs, issued a rare public statement through his website. He thanked those who raised money and awareness over the past three years, bringing ""worldwide attention to this important case."" 2012: Prosecutors say Manning didn't report any mistreatment to them .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Environmentally friendly engineering is really right up Chicago's alley -- in a city project called Green Alleys. Chicago workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into Lake Michigan. The program aims to stop polluted rainwater in the city's alleyways from ending up in adjacent Lake Michigan. Chicago's 13,000 alleys, which allow rear access to buildings, date back to the 1800s. The 1,900 miles of back alleys ease access for garbage collection, loading and parking. They also make up about 3,500 acres of impermeable surface, which has created a big problem. Many of the alleys were built without connections to storm sewers. Rainwater puddles on the pavement and can run into buildings, sometimes flooding basements. ""We wanted to come up with a different way of solving that problem other than reconstructing, putting in a sewer system and adding water to our already full sewer system,"" said Janet Attarian, sustainability coordinator with the Chicago Department of Transportation. So, the extreme alley makeover started with the pavement. The alleys are being resurfaced with concrete, asphalt or paving stones that are permeable -- that is, water runs through them like a sieve to the dirt beneath. Microbes that thrive on stuff like fertilizer and oil are seeded into the pavement or migrate there naturally. They cleanse the water of pollutants from cars and lawns. The cleaner water makes its way into the groundwater, called an aquifer, and then flows into Lake Michigan. That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year. But only about 1 percent of that water finds its way back to the lake, Attarian said. ""So by infiltrating that aquifer, we have a chance to [give] some of that water back."" Additionally, green alleys feature pavement that's high in albedo, or the ability to reflect light. The surface is lighter in color, reflecting more sunlight and absorbing less. ""It's like putting on a white T-shirt instead of a black one on a hot summer day,"" Attarian said. ""It cools the city off and reduces our carbon footprint."" Other features of the Green Alley program include the use of recycled materials in pavement and energy-efficient light fixtures that direct light downward to reduce light pollution. How green are those alleys? Chicago has greened 40 of them, with 48 more scheduled to get the treatment this year.","Chicago covers alleys with special concrete that cleans polluted rain runoff .

"(EW.com) -- Roland Emmerich may never win an Oscar (I'm going out on a limb here), but he gets my vote as the greatest practitioner of good bad movies working in Hollywood today. I don't mean that as a backhanded compliment. Seriously. It takes a certain kind of genius to crank out blockbusters as spectacularly silly as ""Independence Day,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012."" And the main difference between Emmerich and fellow maestros of mayhem like Michael Bay is that he actually seems to be in on the joke. He knows his movies are preposterous nonsense, and he embraces it. John Hodgman explains why men in action movies wear those white tank tops . In his latest big-budget excuse to blow up 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, ""White House Down,"" Emmerich doesn't waste time with anything as conventional as a setup; he just dives right in, introducing us to Channing Tatum's John Cale, a divorced Capitol police officer itching to be a Secret Service agent to impress his daughter (Joey King). While his job interview in the West Wing is going south, right-wing mercenaries take over the White House demanding $400 million. Meanwhile, Cale's daughter has been taken hostage and the president (Jamie Foxx) is left unguarded. Guess who steps in to protect the POTUS? 'Fifty Shades' of No: Actors who will NOT star in 'Fifty Shades of Grey' Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") rip off ""Die Hard"" beat for beat. But when you're having this much fun, why quibble? The entire film is merely an excuse for Tatum to squeeze off machine-gun rounds in a muscle-baring tank top, Foxx to do his cool-cat Obama impression right down to chomping on Nicorette, and Emmerich to revel in what he does best â€” blast the sets (and plausibility) to kingdom come. Comparisons between this and last March's similarly themed ""Olympus Has Fallen"" are going to be inevitable, so let me just say that Emmerich's is the D.C. disaster flick to see.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Prominent Egyptian reformist Mohamed ElBaradei called the military's ouster of President Mohamed Morsy the right thing for the country, even as he said all parties -- including Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood -- should be part of Egypt's future. ""We cannot afford Egypt to fail,"" ElBaradei told CNN on Thursday. ""Nobody can afford Egypt to fail."" Six years after winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his work as head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, ElBaradei was among those who pushed successfully for the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in January 2011. Mohamed ElBaradei: Fast Facts . Morsy won that race, but since taking office he hasn't won over liberals, reformists and others such as ElBaradei who criticized him for not governing for all Egyptians, failing to bolster a faltering economy and promoting a constitution and social policies that some call too restrictive. That sentiment boiled over recently in a massive nationwide rally, followed by the military's demand that Morsy accede to some of the opposition's demands. He did not, and troops subsequently placed him under house arrest and appointed an interim successor. ElBaradei, considered to the be leader of the opposition, insists the military's move is not a coup. ""Either we risk a civil war or ... take extra constitutional measures to ensure that we keep the country together,"" he said, explaining the military's conundrum. ""This is a recall, and it is nothing novel."" The fact that Egypt is in this situation, the former diplomat said, is difficult, especially given the high hopes many in the North African nation had following Mubarak's exit. Egypt: The most populous country in the Arab world . The election that Morsy won was ""fairly free,"" ElBaradei acknowledged. ""Then, unfortunately, the president messed up,"" he told CNN. ""When you end up with 20 million people in the street, of the state of mind that he needs to go and he needs to go now, it's a sad state."" The diplomat said Morsy's departure will serve as a ""reset,"" so Egypt can start over in forming a constitution and putting together an inclusive government. That government should include members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist organization that was banned under Mubarak but has become Egypt's most powerful political force, according to ElBaradei. He said he assumes Morsy could even run again for president, ""though I don't think he would."" What is the Muslim Brotherhood? ""I would hope qualified people from the Brotherhood, from the Salafists should be part of this government,"" ElBaradei said. ""We need everybody need to be part of the political process. We need a cohesive society that is tolerant, that respects each others' differences."" The Muslim Brotherhood propelled Morsy into office, although he resigned as leader of its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, after becoming president. While ElBaradei stated flatly that he personally isn't interested in becoming president, he said he is ""deeply concerned"" about Egypt and willing to do what he can to help steer it to a brighter future . Opinion: Will the Muslim Brotherhood survive? Egyptians have limited patience after years of political and economic turmoil, he said. ""My fears are that we do not deliver,"" ElBaradei said. ""My fear is that the Brotherhood will fear that they are excluded. We need a quick delivery. And ... we need to show the people that we are really focusing on their basic needs."" CNN's Becky Anderson reported from Cairo, and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Mohamed ElBaradei calls President Morsy's ouster ""a recall""

"(CNN) -- Wait a minute, didn't spring start last week? Apparently not. Folks in more than a dozen states, from Missouri to New Jersey and down to North Carolina and Tennessee, navigated dogged precipitation to get to work or school Monday morning. As of 2 p.m. Monday, the National Weather Service had placed a dozen states under winter weather advisories, and most of those states were also subject to the more severe winter storm warnings. Accumulations of up to 7 inches were expected in places such as St. Louis, Indianapolis and Pittsburgh. Forecasters predicted some areas would receive a foot of snow. Mix in blustery winds, and it's a bit of a mess. Photos: Spring is here ... sort of . Time to break out the sleds . More than a foot of snow blanketed St. Louis on Sunday, making it the snowiest single March day ever in the Gateway City, and the second-snowiest day, no matter the month, dating back to 1892. ""I'm a little bummed out,"" St. Louis resident Mary Kelly said at the prospect of another snow day. ""It's a little bit of a buzzkill."" Her son was excited though, getting a day off from school, with spring break scheduled to start Thursday. ""We'll break out the sleds again,"" she said. ""We've got some pretty good sledding hills around here."" Still, the irony isn't lost on Kelly, who knows how changeable Midwestern weather can be. ""The good news is: It's St. Louis,"" she said. ""Next weekend, it could be 80 degrees."" Treacherous travel . The snow prompted flight cancellations and delays across the Midwest and mid-Atlantic states. Around 2 p.m. Monday, FlightAware.com said nearly 600 flights ""within, into or out of the United States"" had been canceled, after 415 cancellations were tallied nationwide Sunday. The website said flights in and out of the three largest New York-New Jersey Port Authority airports -- Newark, John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia -- made up more than a quarter of those cancellations. And even when flights weren't canceled, the storms wrought havoc on travel plans, with delays of at least an hour and a half at the Philadelphia, Newark and JFK-New York airports, and 30- to 45-minute delays at the three largest Washington, D.C., area airports. In Indianapolis, Mayor Greg Ballard told nonessential city employees that they didn't have to come into work until 1 p.m. because of the storm, affiliate WISH-TV reported. Dozens of school districts called off classes for the day. Record-setting snow? In several places, snow was accumulating in historic amounts. Springfield, Illinois, witnessed an all-time single-day record of 17 inches Sunday, in a city where records go back to 1881. In Pittsburgh, forecasters were talking about the rare, heavy spring snowfall. Up to 8 inches are expected. ""From a historical perspective, we've only had snow on the ground, this date or later, of 6 inches or more four times,"" Michael Fries with the National Weather Service told affiliate KDKA-TV. The last time was in 1987, when 7.7 inches fell, setting the record for an early spring storm. Monday's heavy snow could knock down trees and power lines. ""If you must venture out at all ... use extreme caution,"" the weather service warned. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow! Ski areas, including West Virginia's Snowshoe Mountain Resort, 200 miles south of Pittsburgh, are hoping people venture out, and promising the ""best March ski conditions in recent memory."" ""Last year, we had to close by now,"" Snowshoe spokesman David Dekema said Monday. ""By this time, we were shut down. It was warm and raining."" But this year, he said, ""it's looking like winter for the foreseeable future."" Snowshoe had planned to close this Sunday, the last day of March, but the prediction of snow through Thursday is forcing a reassessment. ""We're getting a lot of feedback and questions from our guests who don't want to let winter run out here, and we're having internal discussions about what's feasible,"" Dekema said. ""With our best final weekend snow conditions and so much terrain open, some people want to keep it going and maybe make it into April."" You call this spring? Deep South cold . A deep-plunging Arctic cold front is fueling the storm system, and while the Southern states didn't get much snow, they were feeling winter's bite in unseasonably low temperatures, blustery wind and overwhelming rain. Large sections of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana shivered under freeze warnings, while temperatures in the 40s could be found in the Florida Panhandle. Winds strong enough to prompt advisories whipped Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Arkansas, making the unseasonably cold weather feel even worse. And on top of that, rain deluged a wide swath of the South, with cities as far apart as Columbus, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; and Charleston, South Carolina, all receiving more than 3 inches of rain -- and Valdosta, Georgia, accumulating nearly 5 inches. Winter weather overstays its welcome .","""Best March ski conditions in recent memory,"" says a West Virginia ski resort spokesman .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United Nations issued an urgent plea Wednesday for helicopters as the death toll from weeks of massive flooding in Pakistan reached 1,600 people. ""We need at least 40 additional heavy-lift helicopters, working at full capacity, to reach the huge numbers of increasingly desperate people with life-saving relief,"" Marcus Prior of the World Food Programme said in a statement. The United States will send four more helicopters and an amphibious ready group to Pakistan, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Michael Nagata said from Pakistan Wednesday. By next week, at least 23 U.S. helicopters will be in the country ferrying relief supplies and rescuing people in and around the Swat River valley in northern Pakistan, Nagata said. Floodwaters have washed away critical roads and bridges throughout the country, but especially in the mountainous areas of Gilgit Baltistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, and in the Swat Valley of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. ""In northern areas that are cut off, markets are short of vital supplies, and prices are rising sharply. People are in need of food staples to survive,"" Prior said. The United Nations estimates that 800,000 people in need of humanitarian aid across Pakistan are accessible only by air. The United Nations Children's Fund -- UNICEF -- and its partners estimated Wednesday that 2.5 million people in flood-devastated areas of the country have access to clean water. But an estimated 3.5 million have only contaminated water for drinking, bathing and washing, which puts them at risk for diarrheal diseases. ""Clean water is vital,"" said Martin Mogwanja, humanitarian coordinator in the South Asian nation, in a news release. So far, 3.2 million people have received medical attention in affected areas since the floods began last month, the United Nations said. In all, 462,000 cases of diarrhea, 596,700 cases of skin diseases, and 441,000 of acute respiratory infections have been tallied, it said. And nearly 65,000 cases of malaria have been reported in the south, especially Baluchistan and Sindh, where stagnant water provides breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Over three weeks, Pakistan's floods have claimed nearly 1,600 lives, the national disaster management authority said Wednesday. They have affected more than 17 million people, leaving some 4 million homeless. An estimated 6 million people are in need of emergency shelter, of which just over 1 million have received tents or plastic tarps. And thousands of people are still fleeing. In Shahdadkot, floodwaters were pouring out of breaches, threatening to drown the entire city of 400,000 people, the United Nations' refugee agency said. In Sindh's Thatta district, 150,000 displaced people are in need of shelter. About 80 percent of the area around the Sindh town of Jacobabad was underwater and people in neighboring Balochistan province feared they will be hit equally hard. In Gandhaka, people climbed to rooftops, said a release from the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Adding to the misery, the forecast calls for more monsoon rain across upper Pakistan through Thursday. The United Nations says it still needs $200 million more in aid to cope with the crisis. CNN's Ed Payne and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Hundreds of thousands of people needing aid can be reached only by helicopter .
Pakistan's death toll is approaching 1,600 .

"(CNN) -- With their country having the dubious distinction of first place in a global ranking of obese populations, legislators in Mexico have approved new taxes on high-calorie foods and soft drinks. A measure that cleared the Mexican senate on Thursday and that now awaits the president's signature puts an 8% tax on edibles with high caloric contents. Although the legislation does not identify all foods that fit into its tax category or include a specific list, it cites ""food that is high in calories such as fried foods ... sweets, foods made mainly with cereal, among others..."" Senators also approved a tax of one peso (about seven-and-a-half cents) on every liter of soft drinks. The tax measures come after Mexico jumped ahead of the United States to claim first place in a list of most-obese nations in a U.N. food and agriculture report this year. Meanwhile, in another component of a government effort to combat obesity, the Mexico Health Department is joinging with two pediatric organizations in a campaign to prevent childhood obesity. The campaign's goal is to help doctors understand the complications of obesity, as well as the preventative and treatment measures available, said Arturo Perea-Martinez of Mexico's National Pediatric Institute . According to the World Health Organization, the average Mexican drinks 163 liters (about 43 gallons) of soda a year, which is 40% more than the average U.S. citizen, making Mexico the largest consumer of soft drinks in the world.","Legislation adds an 8% tax on food high in caloric content .

"(CNN) -- Most Americans don't want the United States to launch military strikes against the Syrian government. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll says 59% of the American people oppose such an intervention, while 36% support it. Even more oppose supplying weapons to the Syrian rebels, with 70% against and 27% in favor. Many have welcomed President Barack Obama's move to bring the decision before Congress as giving the issue the kind of national debate it deserves. And hearings this week may move the needle of public opinion to give the president more confidence that he has the backing of U.S. voters. But even if that doesn't happen, the president needs to move ahead with the plan to punish the regime of Bashar al-Assad for the use of chemical weapons in an attack outside Damascus -- to degrade its ability to use such weapons of mass destruction in the future and to force its removal and replacement by opposition forces that we support. Such action does not have to involve U.S. boots on the ground. It should not involve putting U.S. lives at risk. But what it will require is a kind of leadership, clarity and commitment that has been sorely lacking from our Syria policy to date. While leadership often entails persuading others to follow before taking action, sometimes it requires taking action even when it is unpopular because it is the right thing to do. Opinion: Congress, support Obama on Syria . In fact, setting foreign policy by opinion poll is among the most dangerous traps for a political leader. By nature voters are disinclined to take risks and to intervene in distant conflicts. Given the outcome of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, you can hardly blame them. In addition, citizens, even earnest ones, are often reluctant -- and sometimes ill-equipped -- to weigh seriously how the outcome of such conflicts might affect America's long-term national security interests. That is not a slam on those citizens. Often the issues involved are arcane, convoluted and mind-bending, even to so-called experts. Presidents need to take these things into consideration when evaluating just how much weight to give to public opinion. Furthermore, whereas presidents are elected by the people, they are sworn to do what they can not only to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution but also to execute the duties of their office. This means serving as commander in chief of the armed forces, guiding U.S. foreign policy and working with the tools given to them by elected representatives, such as the War Powers Act of 1973, which grants them the authority to take military action without consulting with Congress if they deem it essential. (They have to consult Congress within 60 days. Although it is worth noting that presidents often undertake such action not by drawing on the power granted them under the act but by that conferred to them under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. That's the section giving them the responsibility for being commander in chief.) The critical issue is whether the national interests of the United States are at risk and must be protected. In the case of Syria, it is clear that the president must act. Opinion: Obama's irony, McCain's agony . The administration has said al-Assad has used chemical weapons. This is an abuse of international law and norms that cannot be allowed to stand, or it will send a message to other bad actors -- some of whom represent a direct threat to U.S. soldiers, private citizens and allies, as is the case in the Koreas, to choose one example. (Iran's WMD threat to allies such as Israel, U.S. friends in the Gulf and U.S. military forces in the region is yet another.) Further, if the United States does not act after the president had rightly declared such action would be unacceptable, it would undermine deeply and perhaps irreparably our credibility in the Middle East and worldwide. Just as important, the Assad regime is an ally of Iran's, seeking to advance Iranian power throughout the region and doing so with direct Iranian aid and weapons support. This is a threat to our allies, to regional stability and, by extension, to the global economy and vital energy supplies. Further, the deterioration in Syria has made the country a breeding ground for a new generation of extremists who might be empowered by an al-Assad defeat. We must be careful to place our support behind others, such as the Free Syrian Army, who are most likely to be sympathetic to our views. But we almost recognize that not stabilizing the Syrian crisis, simply ignoring it, will make the situation throughout the region much more dangerous. We must send a clear message chemical weapons use is unacceptable. And we must actively support the opposition with weapons so that they can defeat al-Assad. Even if the regime that replaces him is hostile to us, it is unlikely to pose the kind of regional threat that one supported by Iran does. Risks are involved. Outcomes may not be exactly what we seek. Action may be dangerous and unpopular, but inaction is certain to make the situation worse and the threats to our interests grow. Opinion: GOP shouldn't bail out Obama's floundering foreign policy . The president deserves credit for trying to make this case to the American people. But it is time for him to act whether there is broad support for him or not. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Polls say Americans averse to Syria strike and welcome hearings .
He says basing foreign policy on polls dangerous for a leader who must protect U.S. interests .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of demonstrators demanding the revocation of a new protest law clashed with Egyptian security forces in Cairo Tuesday, igniting a firestorm of criticism online and on the streets, state media and activist reported. Police fired water cannon and tear gas canisters to disperse two small demonstrations, one against the military trials of civilians and another in honor of a man killed by police last year. ""Riot police began pulling and pushing everybody, beating us with sticks, grabbing hair, and dragging people. Immediately afterwards, tear gas was fired. I actually couldn't breathe because the gas was so intense. I started running and I saw some people were being arrested,"" activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN as she described how nearly 200 riot gear clad police officers broke up a demonstration she attended that had around 100 people. Prominent youth activists refused to abandon colleagues detained by the security forces and instead voluntarily surrendered to authorities in a show of solidarity. The group included founders of the group No to Military Trials, journalists, and a human rights lawyer. ""People gathered in front of the Shura Council in central Cairo in violation of the protest law. The security apparatus immediately issued a warning to demonstrators but they did not comply and threw rocks and bricks at the police."" an Interior Ministry statement said, adding that 28 people were detained. Police later dumped more than a dozen of the female detainees along an empty highway after beating and harassing the group for several hours, several witnesses and activists reported Tuesday. ""We were thrown in the desert, our friends found us and we are all ok. F*** scaf (Supreme Council of the Armed Forces) and f*** the police,"" Salma Saed, one of the activists arrested, tweeted upon her release. The crackdown on some of Egypt's most recognizable dissident figures comes just one day after the military-backed government announced the implementation of a new protest law that requires organizers seek permission from authorities before gathering. ""If the police and the government are not getting this message, we can protest every day for the rest of our lives because there are so many people who gave their lives for the right to protest. We gained this right to protest so there is no way we can go back. It is impossible."" Ibrahim said.","Egyptian police use water cannon, tear gas to disperse two demonstrations .

"(CNN) -- It's being presented as the future of cinema and a movie-going revolution. Specs appeal: 3D is on its way to being free of 3D glasses as the format is rapidly advancing. While literally adding a new dimension to cinema-goers' experience, 3D is also being touted as a means to help filmmakers reach new creative heights, make millions of dollars for Hollywood studios and curb the scourge of the industry -- piracy. Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has likened the new 3D to the first sound and color in movies. Director James Cameron's $200 million-plus sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" is an expected genre-killer. The prestigious Cannes Film Festival this year opened with a 3D screening of Pixar's ""Up"". But even as Hollywood studios and producers embrace digital 3D, they admit they are still learning how to use it. ""We've really gone past the point of seeing the technology as a barrier,"" Phil 'Captain 3D' McNally told CNN. McNally heads Dreamworks' drive to produce all its animated features in 3D after this year's blockbuster ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" ""The challenge now is 100 years of experience in how to make movies in 2D,"" said McNally, speaking of a movie industry that has spent its existence flattening the 3D of real life for the silver screen. ""As filmmakers, we have very little experience in thinking spatially, unlike a sculptor,"" he said. ""There's going to be great filmmakers that are going to deliver experiences like you've never seen before,"" said Jason Clark, a motion picture producer who helped launch Dreamworks' 3D foray and worked on ""Monster House"" and ""Stuart Little,"" the first time a photorealistic character was spliced into a live action movie. But ""the storytelling is always king,"" Clark told CNN. ""You can use these techniques to create a unique experience that makes that story impact on a more personal level with the audience. But it should never take away from the experience or lead the storytelling."" Creative boom or creative killer? Filmmakers are greeting 3D with cautious excitement. ""2D is completely a mistake,"" said Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the Academy Award-nominated director of Babel, at a recent press conference in Seoul, South Korea. ""It's like when they criticized me because I use handheld, they said 'you're very gimmicky',"" the director said of his preferred camera style. ""The way I experience life is handheld. 3D is the way we experience life."" But, Inarritu noted, there was a risk that the technology could distract from the story's emotional catharsis, something that other creatives have also voiced concerns about. ""[3D] doesn't guarantee a success or a good movie or a good movie experience,"" said Syd Field, widely appreciated as a screenwriting guru. He noted that the talking pictures had their growing pains in the 1920's; Hollywood imported playwrights to craft dialogue but filmmakers paid more attention to cameras and sound recorders. ""As we learned to use the technology, then it began to become an art form,"" Field told CNN. ""3D right now is at its infant stages."" The rise of digital cinema has given 3D its legs. Gone are the days of struggling to synch two separate projectors to create a 3D effect that would sometimes come with nausea or headaches. The iconic kitsch of the red and blue-lense cardboard glasses has been replaced by sleeker polarized aviator models. The future is 3D without glasses, delivered through autostereoscopic displays. Digital projection is ""rock steady"" and could define how different generations take on 3D, said Clark. ""The way you interpret 3D images is that your brain looks at each separate image, the left and right image, and it stitches them together,"" Clark said, likening it to adults using muscles they don't normally use. ""But kids, it's all new to them, and they haven't had the painful experience of watching misaligned 3D in the 1970's, the 1980's, and the 1990's. So I think the experience for them is a lot easier to interpret."" It's no coincidence that animation is leading 3D releases, along with horror, Clark said, as the children who watched 2004's ""Polar Express"" are growing up. ""Now you're going to have to deliver them different kinds of content. So your audience is growing."" Eyes on the prize . For theatre owners, studios and distributors, 3D appears a healthy cash cow, with higher-priced tickets helping titles gross up to three times as much as their 2D counterparts. The United States will have around 3,000 3D screens by the end of this year when ""Avatar"" is scheduled for release, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO). About 90 to 100 screens are being added every month, though theatre operators are pausing in a tight credit market. ""Movie theatre owners are highly conscious of the expense involved in installing a 3D system,"" said Patrick Corcoran, Director of Media & Research at NATO, noting that out of approximately 600 theatrical releases this year, only 12 to 15 will be offered in 3D. ""No one knows right now how big the market will be,"" Corcoran told CNN. The studios are looking for scale. About ""5,000 screens in 2,000 to 3,000 locations"" is the tipping point that would allow an exclusively 3-D release, said McNally. ""That point should be reached within one or two years."" Filling those theatres will be people who don't want to watch bootleg versions, Hollywood hopes, as 3D comes with a promise that it's hard to pirate. ""If you are really determined, you can make a copy of anything,"" said McNally, suggesting that 3-D movies could be recorded through the same kind of lenses used in 3-D glasses, but pirates would have to be ""pretty serious"" to pull it off. The real deterrent appears to be the widening gap between home and theatre. Leaked DVD quality movies are being downloaded on better broadband Internet and played on surround-sound home entertainment systems. 3D promises to deliver a unique experience in theatres that could allow Hollywood to take something back. Studios and theatre owners insist there's no real comparison. ""Comedies are funnier when everybody's laughing. Movies are scarier when everybody's frightened. And that's something that can't be replicated in the home,"" Corcoran said. ""It comes down to the kind of enjoyment you want from your movie experience,"" McNally said, likening the choice to visiting the Grand Canyon or seeing a photograph, that ""doesn't capture the sense of the place, the space, how you felt when you were there.""","Digital tech impetus behind 3D films; studios still working out how best to use .
Format could lead to new creative boom in Hollywood, say analysts .
Movie industry suggests 3D films are much harder to pirate .
Advocates estimate tipping point of 5,000 3D theatres in U.S. in two years ."
"Washington (CNN) -- NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has reached back 13.2 billion years -- farther than ever before in time and space -- to reveal a ""primordial population"" of galaxies never seen before. ""The deeper Hubble looks into space, the farther back in time it looks, because light takes billions of years to cross the observable universe,"" the Space Telescope Science Institute said in a statement released Tuesday. ""This makes Hubble a powerful 'time machine' that allows astronomers to see galaxies as they were 13 billion years ago -- just 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang,"" the institute said in a statement released Tuesday. The existence of these newly found galaxies pushes back the time when galaxies began to form to before 500-600 million years after the Big Bang, the institute said. ""These galaxies could have roots stretching into an earlier population of stars. There must be a substantial component of galaxies beyond Hubble's detection limit,"" according to James Dunlop of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who was quoted in the release. Members of the American Astronomical Society are meeting this week in Washington to review the data and images retrieved by Hubble's new infrared Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), which was installed in May, institute spokesman Ray Villard told CNN. Some of the images were shared with the public in September. The camera, Villard said, is far superior to the previous camera, which could only see galaxies about 900 million years after the Big Bang -- the cosmic explosion that is theorized to mark the origin of the universe. But it is reaching its limits, he said. A more powerful instrument, the James Webb Space Telescope, is planned for launch in 2014. It will allow astronomers to study the detailed nature of early galaxies and discover many more even farther away. From the current cache of images, astronomers can see for the first time that ""galaxies grew from small, bright clusters of stars to the big spiral cities of stars today,"" Villard said. The small galaxies show up as ultra-blue in color. He likened the Hubble results to ""looking through a scrapbook of baby pictures."" According to the institute, ""the deep observations also demonstrate the progressive buildup of galaxies and provide further support for the hierarchical model of galaxy assembly, where small objects ... merge to form bigger objects over a smooth and steady but dramatic process of collision and agglomeration. It's like streams merging into tributaries and then into a bay."" The camera was pointed at a section of sky known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which was initially surveyed in visible light in 2004, and showed a dark sky filled with more than 10,000 galaxies. The WFC3 instrument repeated the exercise in August for infrared light. Some mosaics were formed with the images from both surveys. According to Villard, the archive from Hubble contains more than 500,000 pictures that can be accessed by the world's 6,000 astronomers. The data from the Ultra Deep Field have been analyzed by at least five international teams of astronomers, he said.","Findings show galaxies grew from small, bright clusters of stars to big spirals of today .

"(CNN) -- A traditional grand conclave of elders, a Loya Jirga, convenes Thursday in Kabul, Afghanistan, to decide whether U.S. forces can remain in the country past 2014. But events this past weekend illustrated the continuing perils and myopia of American policy. On Saturday, just a few hundred yards from the site of Thursday's critical meeting, expected to be attended by 2,500 people, a car bomb exploded, killing at least 13 people. The Taliban took responsibility. At the same time, at Georgetown University in Washington, former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton took the stage together to exhort Americans not to abandon the women of Afghanistan. Former Secretary of State Clinton stated that it is essential the U.S. continue to play a role in the country to provide the security necessary for continued progress for Afghan women and girls. American reconstruction of Afghanistan is the most expensive reconstruction of a single country in U.S. history, costing more than $90 billion to date. The United States has given more to Afghanistan than any other single country during the Marshall Plan after World War II. Last year, Afghanistan received almost twice as much as the next four largest foreign assistance country beneficiaries combined. With about 2,300 U.S. service members killed in this effort, the loss to American families has also been incalculable. Yet, with all this sacrifice, the United States is not meaningfully closer to the goals Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration have asked us to embrace. While our political leaders laud that progress and the need for a continued U.S. military presence, the Taliban respond with more bombs and more innocent lives are lost. Loya jirga approves U.S.-Afghan security deal; asks Karzai to sign . Hopes now for any kind of peace in Afghanistan largely depend on Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. After the Loya Jirga, a delegation of the Afghan High Peace Council will reportedly visit Pakistan to meet Baradar in a renewed push to end the decades' long conflict. Baradar, once the top deputy to Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Muhammad Omar, was freed from jail in Pakistan in September at the request of the Afghan government to help facilitate the peace process. Mullah Omar has denounced the Loya Jirga and the Taliban opposes any U.S. troops remaining. Having interviewed Mullah Baradar's assistant and other Taliban fighters and leaders, it is clear that their worldview is as far from the Americans' and the largely Western-educated elite we rely on to run Afghanistan as ever. In the world of Mullah Omar, Mullah Baradar and many of the Taliban leaders, their path is driven by the power of religious visions and dreams. Each ""true night dream"" is nothing less than a prophecy of God. And each leader's authority comes from God. The seminal event in sealing Mullah Omar's authority as unquestioned leader happened in April 1996. Then, in the dusty southern Afghan Pashtun stronghold of Kandahar, Mullah Omar donned, from a religious shrine, the holy relic of the cloak of the Prophet Muhammad. After the initial American victory in Afghanistan at the end of 2001, Mullah Omar and Mullah Baradar retreated to Quetta, in Pakistan. As recounted to me by someone in Omar's inner circle, the Mullah was devastated by the Taliban's defeat. Paralyzed with inaction, Mullah Omar could not decide what to do, waiting patiently for another ""true night dream"" from God. As a result, Mullah Baradar helped to direct a meeting in the spring of 2002 at a madrassa in Quetta with Mullah Omar's favorite seer. It was only after the Taliban seer recounted a dream in which he saw Mullah Omar's ""beard turn a blinding white -- for it was now made of the threads of the holy prophet's very cloak"" that Omar decided to lead the fight again against the Americans inside Afghanistan. This is the same Mullah Baradar upon which peace talks now substantially depend. While our Afghan allies hold the Loya Jirga to decide the fate of a continued U.S. military presence in the country, their Taliban enemies deliver their response with more bombs. And while the U.S. continues to invest unprecedented resources into a largely corrupt and feckless Afghan government, the Taliban leaders wait for dreams. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen.","A Loya Jirga council meets in Afghanistan to decide if U.S. troops may stay past 2014 .
Ken Ballen: In Taliban message to Loya Jirga, a bombing killed 13 near meeting site .
Ballen: Afghan security depends on talks with a leader of Taliban, which denounces U.S. presence .
Ballen: U.S. spent $90 billion in Afghanistan, the Taliban is resurgent, our goals still unmet ."
"San Francisco (CNN) -- Mobile payments company Square is supersizing its hardware. On Tuesday, CEO Jack Dorsey unveiled the Square iPad stand, which the company hopes will replace traditional cash registers. The Square Stand is a white countertop unit that looks like a small iMac. It holds an iPad 2 or 3 and features a card reader that juts out on the bottom. It's the company's first piece of hardware since the original Square reader. The $299 unit includes a USB hub that can connect to third-party tools that traditional retailers still rely on, such as a cash drawer, receipt printer and barcode scanner. Square believes the future of payments isn't swiping a card but merely giving a cashier your name, which is stored within the company's database and linked to a credit card. But there are a lot of companies that still take cash, and customers who want paper receipts. Smaller mobile merchants such as food trucks, coffee shops and taxis have all flocked to the small Square reader, which plugs into an iPhone or iPad's headphone port. But Square wanted to create a product that could work for higher volume brick and mortar merchants, including those that still accept old-fashioned cash. Square also thinks that having a more solid physical register is a good move for smaller merchants. ""It adds this sense of security, validation that you're a business,"" Dorsey said at an event here. The Square Stand can be affixed to a table or drilled in through a hole in the counter for added security. It tilts and swivels around so customers can do their part, like adding a tip or signing their name. It connects to the iPad's dock connector instead of the audio jack, and the company said the credit card reader works every time a card is swiped. Dorsey wouldn't say if the readers were coming to Square partner Starbucks anytime soon, though he did say that the two companies were working together. According to Dorsey, Square didn't want to disrupt Starbucks' counter setup until it knew it had a product that could beat the speed of the current system. ""What matters most is getting people through the line,"" Dorsey said. The Square Stand seems built for speed. The stands will be seen in 13 businesses in 30 locations around the United States, starting Wednesday.","Mobile payments company Square announced a new iPad stand and credit card reader .

"(CNN) -- Does the end of the world start with a snowstorm? Probably not, but a blizzard in the upper Midwest is proving potent enough to cut power to tens of thousands of homes and force schools to call it quits from Nebraska to southern Wisconsin Thursday -- one day ahead of the official arrival of winter and, as it happens, the predicted Mayan apocalypse. Blinding snow also is blamed for a 30-car pileup on Interstate 35 near Fort Dodge, Iowa, in which two people died, including a 43-year-old Arkansas woman, Sgt. Scott Bright of the Iowa State Patrol said Wednesday. As much as another foot of wet, heavy snow is expected in places, accompanied by winds gusting to 50 mph and blowing snow that could reduce visibility to just about zero, forecasters warn. In Omaha, Nebraska, utility crews struggled overnight -- sometimes in near whiteout conditions -- to restore power to 38,500 customers left in the dark by the storm, according to the Omaha Public Power District. The utility urged customers to brace for slow going. ""Assessment crews and repair crews are out in force and will be as long as it takes to get through storm and all is cleaned up,"" said Omaha Public Power District spokeswoman Paula Lukowski. In neighboring Iowa, more than 30,000 customers were without power, most of them in the Des Moines area, according to MidAmerican Energy. The storm -- the first blizzard of the season -- made travel treacherous throughout the region. Nebraska authorities closed much of snow-packed Interstate 80 through the state Thursday morning as blowing snow dangerously reduced visibility. I-80 also was closed around Des Moines, Iowa, Bright said. ""When the winds start to blow you can see about 5 feet in front of your vehicle"" he said. ""We've had major issues all over the place. We got around 10 to 12 inches throughout the state and it's a wet snow. We have around an inch of ice on our roadways."" He warned that even though conditions might not seem so bad around people's homes, they should not take that as a signal that the storm is over. ""It seems people are seeing the sun and venturing out, but it's not going to get hot enough to melt the ice from the roadways,"" he said. Department of Transportation workers are ""out and they're plowing the roadways, but we're having 50 mph wind gusts that just blows the snow right back."" Close to 100 accidents had been reported in Iowa by late Thursday morning, Bright said, ""and we have a lot of jackknifed semis, which shut the roadway down."" Thick snow also blanketed the roads and swirled in the frigid air as CNN iReporter Kevin Cavallin drove through Ames, Iowa, late Wednesday night. Occasional flashes of lightning illuminated the snow-covered scene, punctuated by windy gusts of up to 40 miles per hour, as Iowa shivered under its first significant snowfall of the year. Fellow CNN iReporter Clarence Smith in Des Moines said it was the most snow he'd seen since 2009 -- and he warns its wet, heavy consistency was going to add to the challenges for motorists. ""I was just cleaning off my car and it is so wet, it is like plaster. It doesn't come off easily,"" he said. ""At one point I was hitting it with a snow scraper, you can say chiseling, basically."" And while many Iowans may be cursing the weather Thursday as they slip and slide around, Smith points out that the state has enjoyed a record period without snow. CNN iReporter Ron Packer's morning drive to work, usually 25 minutes, was doubled by the slower traffic in Kansas City, Missouri, he said. ""Most of the preparation for this weather is mental,"" Packer said. ""Many people 'forget' how to drive in winter weather when the first snow comes around. As a native Californian, I had to go through that learning curve!"" Kathleen Barrett, a CNN iReporter driving from Colorado to Wyoming Wednesday, called road conditions ""horrible."" ""I could not see in front of me,"" Barrett said. Dirt and rocks put on the highway to keep vehicles from sliding cracked her windshield as she crept along at 10 mph, she said. For CNN iReporter David Bell and three of his friends, the conditions were just too bad to continue driving home to Lincoln, Nebraska. They holed up in a hotel overnight on their way back from a ski trip in Colorado after seeing several accidents on the interstate and highways. ""We knew the roads were icy, so we were driving slow,"" he said. ""We could see about 100 yards, sometimes less. When the winds would gust the visibility would drop to 50 feet. There was a lot of snow, and we were driving east and the wind was blowing from the north, and it didn't help at all."" In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker declared a state of emergency, put the National Guard and state patrol on standby and closed state offices to the public in 20 counties most likely to be affected by the storm. Employees were still expected to report for work. As much as 7 inches was already on the ground Thursday morning in parts of southern Wisconsin, with as much as another foot on the way during the storm's predicted Thursday afternoon peak. The Wisconsin State Patrol and National Weather Service urged people to avoid traveling. Blizzard warnings were up Thursday for portions of Nebraska, Missouri, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin and virtually all of Iowa. Winter storm warnings extended further into Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin, as well as into Michigan and Indiana. Most airports were operating normally, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. One major exception was O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, where incoming flights were running nearly two hours behind because of high winds, the FAA said. Airlines canceled more than 200 flights at O'Hare Wednesday. Southwest Airlines has canceled all flights out of Chicago's Midway starting at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. Southwest has between 200 and 220 flights there on normal days. The storm is expected to slide over New England by Friday. CNN's Stefan Simons, Jim Kavanagh, Jareen Imam, Laura Smith-Spark, Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Heavy snow and high winds stretch from Iowa to Wisconsin in the season's first blizzard .

"(CNN) -- A Russian space freighter carrying cargo to the International Space Station has crashed in a remote area of Siberia, Russian emergency officials said Wednesday. The unmanned Progress cargo craft, which launched at 7 p.m. in Kazakhstan (9 a.m. ET) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, was due to dock with the ISS on Friday. Rescue teams have been dispatched to the crash site of the Progress-M12M, the regional branch of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN. Officials could not immediately confirm whether the crash might have caused any damage on the ground. Russia's Interfax news agency reported that the rocket had come down in the Altai region. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian government space agency Roscosmos reported that the cargo ship had deviated from its planned trajectory shortly after takeoff, failing to reach the target orbit, and had disappeared from radars. ""The engine system's erratic functioning and its subsequent breakdown occurred during the operation of the third stage at the 325th second of the flight of the Soyuz-U carrier rocket with the Progress M-12M resupply vehicle,""  Roscosmos said in a statement. The spacecraft was to deliver more than 3.5 tonnes (about 3.85 U.S. tons) of cargo to the crew of the ISS now orbiting the Earth, Roscosmos said. The load included food supplies, medical equipment, personal hygiene items, as well as scientific equipment needed for experiments aboard the ISS, according to space officials. There are currently six astronauts at the ISS -- three from Russia, two from the United States and one from Japan. ""The situation with the loss of the Progress is not good, of course, but there are stocks of necessities aboard the ISS to support the cosmonauts that will be sufficient to last out until the arrival of the next Progress"" cargo ship, Russia's Space Mission Control executive Vladimir Solovyov told Russia's Interfax news agency. ""The cosmonauts won't have to save on food-stuffs,"" he said. Another Progress freighter is scheduled to launch on October 28, Solovyov said. Space experts said Wednesday's crash was the first failure of a Progress cargo unit in more than 30 years of operation. However, it is the second failed space launch in Russia in less than 10 days. On August 18, Russia lost a sophisticated Express-AM4 telecommunications satellite when the launch vehicle put it into the wrong orbit. In the latest incident, Mission Control Houston said it had received a report of an ""off-nominal situation"" during the Progress rocket's third and final stage. NASA spokesman Rob Navias, at the Johnson Space Center in Houston told CNN that contact with the space craft had been lost about three minutes before it was to reach orbit. He said the six people currently living on the ISS are ""well supplied -- actually oversupplied"" since the delivery of goods by the final U.S. shuttle mission, carried out by Atlantis last month. NASA is now reliant on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit, since the grounding of the U.S. shuttle fleet has left the United States with no way to lift humans into space. Plans are in the works for private companies to begin shipping cargo to the station, and eventually to carry astronauts as well. Progress-series space freighters have been the backbone of Russian space cargo operations for decades, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reports. In addition to taking supplies to the ISS, they have been used to carry out scientific experiments and help adjust the space station's orbit, the agency reports. The Johnson Space Center in Texas is home to NASA's astronaut corps and trains astronauts from the United States and other nations. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: Russian space chief says the six people aboard the ISS have enough food to last .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""When Dr. Johnson defined patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel, he was unconscious of the then undeveloped capabilities of the word 'reform.'"" So quipped U.S. Sen. Roscoe Conkling of New York 130 years ago. The particular reform that irked Conkling was the then-novel proposal to eliminate patronage in federal civil service hiring. Conkling lost his argument and lost his battle, but his quip endures -- and applies much more aptly to today's most discussed ""reform"": immigration reform. ""Immigration reform"" is a deliberately ambiguous phrase, a phrase used equally by opposite sides in the immigration debate. Those who want amnesty for illegal immigrants call themselves ""reformers."" So do those who want stricter enforcement of the laws against illegal immigration. But there's a third group to be heard, and these are the people who validate Conkling's cynical remark: the group of ""reformers"" who want to expand and enlarge guest worker programs. The United States is entering its sixth year of extraordinarily high unemployment. Twelve million Americans who want work cannot find it. Millions more have quit searching. Slack labor markets have depressed wages throughout the economy. Here's the picture that's worth a thousand words, from an economic commentary by Margaret Jacobson and Filippo Occhino for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Whichever of the two competing data series you use, wages account for a substantially lower share of national income today than at any point since World War II, when record-keeping began. Yet even these dismal findings understate the problem. Remember, ""labor income"" includes all salary income, including the salaries of the most highly paid, the famous 1%, who have enjoyed the benefit of almost all productivity gains since the 1990s. The wage situation of the typical worker looks even worse than the chart implies. Whatever else you say about the U.S. economy of the 21st century, it cannot be described as suffering from labor shortages. Yet however little workers earn, there is always somebody who wishes they earned even less. And for those somebodies, the solution is: Import more cheap labor. But not just any cheap labor -- cheap labor that cannot quit, that cannot accept a better offer, that cannot complain. Bonded labor is the oldest idea in American labor markets. In the 17th and 18th centuries, about half the British migrants to the United States arrived as indentured servants, people who agreed to work for a term of years in exchange for food, lodging, and the cost of their passage. Perhaps you assumed that such arrangements had expired centuries ago? Think again. The March 8 Wall Street Journal tells the story of 14 foreign students who entered the United States on ""J"" class visas, which allow three months of work to support student study and travel. ""'Since I got to the States, I have been working just to pay to live in a basement,' says Mr. Rios, who arrived in mid-December and shares the one-room space with five other foreigners who work at the same outlet. He said he worked about 25 hours a week earning $7.25 an hour and Mr. Cheung, his boss, deducted weekly rent of $75 from his pay. ... Kah Inn Lee, a 23-year-old student from Malaysia, said a curtain separated the men's and women's beds in the tiny basement she shared with seven other students in a house owned by Mr. Cheung's son. Earning about $250 a week, she calculates she is in the red after paying for housing and food. To travel after completing her assignment at McDonald's, which ends this weekend, she has asked relatives to wire her money."" Stories like this are often told about the J-1 visa program, which brought about 109,000 students to the United States in 2011. The Associated Press reported on the program last year: ""In August 2011, dozens of workers protested conditions at a candy factory that contracts to pack Hershey chocolates in Hershey, Pa., complaining of hard physical labor and pay deductions for rent that often left them with little money. Then in December, a federal indictment accused the mafia of using the cultural exchange program to bring Eastern European women to work in New York strip clubs."" J-1 visa workers have told investigators that deductions for rent and food reduce their earnings to zero. They have described sexual abuse and exploitation. The State Department has proposed some changes to the program, but -- well, let Alaska's KTVA Channel 11 tell the rest of the story. ""Many seafood processors in Alaska rely on foreign students to fill their seasonal employment needs. Now there is uncertainty in the industry because of proposed changes to the foreign worker visa program. These changes could take effect as soon as this spring. ""The federal government wants to remove some jobs offered to foreign students who want to work in the U.S. on a J-1 visa. They include jobs in factories and manufacturing, a potential change that could hit Alaska's seafood processors hard. ""In a letter Senator Mark Begich wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, he says 'such an abrupt change in the available labor pool just before the start of the salmon season would have immediate negative consequences for the companies, and the fishermen and communities, which depend on their operations,'"" KTVA reported. You might wonder: Are there really no Americans who could do these jobs? The unemployment rate for Alaskans 16-24 years old was over 15% in 2011. Mightn't they want the work? Yes, they might. But the wage for lawful American labor in the seafood-processing industry averages over $10 an hour. Employers can cut their wage costs by almost 25% by using J-1 labor instead, according to one union-backed think tank. And J-1 labor is not only cheaper, but also often more motivated. ""The J-1 student workers have been a godsend for Nancy Blakey, co-owner of Sno-Pac,"" reported PRI's ""The World."" ""'They're educated, they're bright, and they're working really hard, long hours,' Blakey said. Alaska fish processors started hiring J-1 students in the 1990s when unemployment was low and they couldn't find American workers. The J-1â€²s are not just hard workers, Blakey said; they're also really interesting. ""'We had a young man come through who was studying nuclear physics. And we were talking, and he loved the beauty of nuclear physics. He was passionate and he was explaining it to me, in his limited English and doing very well. And he was going to be going out to gut fish. I think that's pretty fantastic!'"" The immigration debate is often premised on the assumption that high wages for American workers are a problem to be overcome. If you'll look again at the Cleveland Fed chart above, you'll notice that the collapse in labor's share of national income coincides with the start of the mass immigration influx after 1970. Since then 40 million people have migrated to the United States, most of them very low-skilled. About one-third that number arrived illegally. Immigration advocates insist that this huge surge of cheap labor has nothing to do with the persistent decline in wages that began about the same time. If so, that's one hell of a coincidence. With President Obama proposing accelerated flows of immigration in future, American workers should ready themselves for more coincidences ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Immigration ""reform"" is a deliberately ambiguous phrase .
For some employers, immigrants represent a source of cheap labor, he says .
Frum: Big wave of immigration coincides with decline in labor's share of economy .
America doesn't have a labor shortage, but wages may be too low, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Somewhere, someone is kicking themselves for being nice to a little old lady. Gloria Mackenzie, 84, came forward to claim the second-largest U.S. lottery jackpot, more than two weeks after the $590.5 million Powerball drawing on May 18, Florida Lottery officials announced Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- A European satellite has observed a rapid retreat of one of Antarctica's ice shelves, which is half the size it was 10 years ago, the European Space Agency said Thursday. The agency's Envisat satellite shows part of the Larsen Ice Shelf, which lies on a peninsula south of Chile, has decreased from 3,463 square kilometers (1,337 square miles) in March 2002 to 1,670 square kilometers (645 square miles) today, a change the European Space Agency blames on warmer temperatures. ""Ice shelves are sensitive to atmospheric warming and to changes in ocean currents and temperatures,"" Helmut Rott from the University of Innsbruck said in an statement from the space agency. ""The northern Antarctic Peninsula has been subject to atmospheric warming of about 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 Fahrenheit degrees) over the last 50 years -- a much stronger warming trend than on global average, causing retreat and disintegration of ice shelves."" The waning is happening on the Larsen B ice shelf, one of three shelves that make up the Larsen Ice Shelf. Larsen A disintegrated in January 1995. Larsen C has so far been stable, the space agency said, though satellites have observed some recent thinning and melting. Larsen B measured 11,512 square kilometers in January 1995. It went down to 6,664 square kilometers in February 2002 after several parts broke off, and a month later Larsen B was down to 3,463 square kilometers. The space agency says the satellite's observations confirm the vulnerability of the ice shelves to climatic warming.","The Larsen B ice shelf has decreased dramatically since March 2002 .

Another Larsen ice shelf disintegrated and a third is stable ."
