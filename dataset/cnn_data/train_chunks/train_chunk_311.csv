"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania patient accused of shooting his caseworker to death has been charged with first and third-degree murder, authorities said. Richard Plotts was arraigned late Saturday at his hospital bed, said spokeswoman Emily Harris of the Delaware County District Attorney's office. He is also charged with attempted murder, recklessly endangering another, assault and simple assault, and carrying a firearm without a license, Harris said. On Thursday, Plotts, 49, walked into the psychiatric unit Mercy Fitzgerald Wellness Center in Darby, Pennsylvania, alongside his caseworker Theresa Hunt, 53, according to Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan. The two went into psychiatrist Dr. Lee Silverman's office and an argument erupted, Whelan said. Hunt shut the door and called police. Moments later, shots were fired. Another doctor and caseworker ran into the room and found Hunt wounded, authorities said. The physicians wrestled Plotts to the floor and held him until police came. A bullet grazed Silverman's head. He was treated and released after investigators interviewed him. Silverman used a gun he was carrying to shoot Plotts in the arm and torso, authorities said. Plotts was being treated at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. It's unclear why Plotts opened fire, authorities said last week. Whelan told CNN affiliate WPVI, ""This could be a much different situation if the perpetrator was allowed to continue with his actions, so I give credit for the staff for intervening."" Two guns were recovered at the scene -- Plotts' and Silverman's. It wasn't certain who shot Hunt but, according to Whelan, investigators believe Silverman shot Plotts in self-defense.

"(CNN) -- A Denver woman called 911 when her husband began to hallucinate and speak of ""the end of the world."" For 13 minutes, the wife spoke of fear -- for herself, their three scared children, her husband. Richard Kirk wanted his wife to shoot him, she told 911. She screamed when he went to the family safe and grabbed a gun. The 911 operator heard what sounded like a gunshot. The wife went silent on the 911 call. Responding police found her dead Monday in the family home with an apparent gunshot wound to the head, authorities said. She was identified as Kristine Kirk by CNN affiliate KWGN. Kirk admitted that he killed his wife -- ""without questioning,"" a police document says -- when an officer put him in the backseat of a patrol car, the probable cause document says. Those harrowing events, provided by authorities, are now being investigated by Denver police, who are looking at how 911 handled the 13-minute emergency call and whether Kirk was using marijuana or another drug, authorities said Wednesday. ""This is under investigation,"" Denver police spokeswoman Raquel Lopez said about the possibility of marijuana use. Colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana, allowing pot stores to open for business on January 1. At a court hearing Wednesday, Kirk, 47, was ordered held without bail on an accusation of first-degree murder, Denver court records showed. In response to questions about the incident, Denver police posted on its Twitter page: ""We will report the truth, even if mistakes were made."" In response to apparent questions about the handling of the 911 call, the police posted another tweet: ""No indication the call taker erred. Very tough call to handle, please give benefit of doubt."" The city of Denver auditor's office this year began studying police response times, which have grown longer in recent years, the Denver Post reported. The report is expected in June, and police have cited fewer officers and limited budgets for hiring more officers since 2008 as causes for longer response times, the newspaper reported. Lance Kirk, brother of Richard Kirk, told KWGN that he was stunned to hear of the incident. ""I know that wasn't Richard -- let's just say that,"" Lance Kirk told the news outlet. ""I hope there are some answers that come out about this. ""My heart goes out to those three boys and Kris' family -- mom, dad, sister and brothers,"" Lance Kirk added, referring to his sister-in-law. ""This is a terrible thing."" Neighbors, family and friends told the station they knew the couple as loving and devoted parents. ""Whatever those boys are going through right now, my thoughts and my prayers are with them, and I hope that they find peace,"" neighbor Kristin Fynewever told the affiliate. Other neighbors told CNN affiliate KCNC that the couple's three young sons are all in grade school. ""I used to go to school with them and they were really nice kids and they didn't deserve for this to happen to their mom and their dad,"" neighbor Alesa Moskal told KCNC.

"(CNN) -- For some time, sugary soft drinks have been under attack as a major contributor to the obesity epidemic plaguing the nation, if not the world. As a result, sales of regular soft drinks have been dropping. Apparently, sales of diet soft drinks have taken even more of a hit. So it comes as no surprise that Coca-Cola is planning to launch a new ad campaign defending -- and promoting -- its diet soft drinks. The ads are going to focus on the safety of artificial sweeteners, or aspartame, in diet soda. Coca-Cola must believe that some of the fall in sales is due to concerns over the health effects of artificial sweeteners. Here's the thing: There's a lot of science out there, and it's hard to say that aspartame holds much of a health risk. Aspartame was first approved for use in 1981, but it wasn't until 15 years later that health concerns showed up. In 1996, a research paper showed that there had been a recent increase in brain tumors and hypothesized that this might be due to aspartame. Mind you, it didn't prove that was so. But the potential link was all the media needed to go crazy. TV shows, magazine articles, and newspapers all questioned whether the artificial sweetener was safe. Further work using data from the National Cancer Institute showed that the increase in brain tumors really began in 1973, long before aspartame was introduced. Moreover, the increases in incidence of cancer were seen primarily in the elderly, which as a group, was not the major consumer of diet soda. And there's more. A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial showed that aspartame didn't affect memory, behavior or mood. And a study published in 2006 followed more than 285,000 men and almost 190,000 women and couldn't detect any relationship between aspartame and brain or blood cancer. Some research has shown that drinking artificially sweetened beverages doesn't promote weight loss, or even promotes weight gain. More often than not, this is because people wind up overcompensating for the calorie savings they think they're getting by switching beverages (think of the person who orders dessert as a reward for having diet soda). But in those cases it's not the diet beverage that caused weight gain; it's dieters' behavior. You can even find people who postulate that artificially sweetened beverages trick the brain into wanting more calories. There's really no proof of that. Finally, some will claim that diet drinks will cause the brain to release insulin, which can change your metabolism and make you hungry. That's a bit hard to swallow. That's like saying if you ate sugar-dense food that tasted terrible, it would trick your brain into not releasing insulin. It's the pancreas that releases insulin anyway, not the brain. The bottom line is that artificially sweetened beverages are safe. That doesn't mean you should drink tons of them. My wife and I limit our kids' consumption of soda to caffeine-free, diet types. But we don't let our children drink them every day. We stress moderation in everything. The fact that Coca-Cola and other companies are seeing sales drop across the board is likely to create a backlash against artificial beverages in general. It's hard to get too upset about that, since our consumption of them was likely too high to begin with. But we shouldn't make the perfect the enemy of the good. Given a choice between a sugared soda and a sugar-free soda, I'd rather see my kids choose the latter every time. There's an abundance of evidence that the sugar is contributing to health problems; there's not much conclusive evidence that artificial sweeteners in diet sodas are doing the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Coco-Cola is launching a new ad campaign to defend artificial sweeteners in diet soda .
Aaron Carroll: It's no surprise, since sales of diet soda is dropping more than regular soda .
He says there's little evidence to support the idea that artificial sweeteners pose health risk .
Carroll: Given a choice, it's still better to choose sugar-free soda over sugared soda ."
"(CNN) -- The upheaval in Ukraine has spiraled into an increasingly tense dispute between Russia and the West. The United States and many European countries are demanding that Moscow scale back its deployment of troops in Ukraine's southern region of Crimea. But Russian President Vladimir Putin so far appears unfazed by the pressure. By Russia's account, its soldiers are protecting the human rights of worried, vulnerable Russian speakers. But in the U.S. view, Russia is violating international law. Caught in the middle is Ukraine's shaky new government. With armed men are locked in an uneasy standoff in Crimea, the consequences could be deadly. And their effects may ripple out far beyond Ukraine's corner of Eastern Europe. What is Russia trying to achieve? Some commentators have suggested that Putin has overplayed his hand by sending troops into Crimea, creating a situation that will hurt both Ukraine and Russia. But others say it's a calculated move based on the assessment that the West will fail to come up with a strong, unified response. ""Putin's broader plan is to recreate some kind of 'Soviet Union lite,' a ring of countries under Moscow's control, with the goal of boosting Russia's geopolitical standing,"" Ulrich Speck, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels, writes in an opinion article for CNN. If Putin gets what he wants in Ukraine, Speck says it augurs badly for other neighboring countries with Russian populations. He points to Moscow's ""de facto-annexation"" of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia after the war between Russia and Georgia in 2008. ""Beyond Ukraine, this conflict is also a defining moment for future Russian foreign policy,"" Speck says. ""If Moscow succeeds in Ukraine, it will come to the conclusion that it can act like an empire."" On the ground in Crimea: Relaxed but eerie . What options are available to the U.S. and the West? Washington is preparing potential sanctions that could freeze the overseas assets of Russian individuals and companies and impose travel bans on some Russian officials. But for many of the measures to really bite, Obama needs to get key European allies on board, some of whom appear reluctant to take too hard a line on Russia. The United States has already halted trade and investment talks and military-to-military engagements with Russia. Questions remain over how broad the sanctions will be, and whether the United States can persuade its European allies to implement them. ""Inside the EU there is no unity about the proper reaction,"" says Speck. One option for defusing the crisis, mentioned by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, would be the deployment of international monitors in the Crimea to provide the protection to Russian citizens that Moscow says its troops are providing. But Russia isn't showing any signs it intends to pull back its soldiers for the time being. What can Obama do about Russia's invasion of Crimea? Why doesn't the United States respond militarily? Nobody in Washington appears eager for a military confrontation with America's nuclear-armed former Cold War opponent. ""The last thing anybody wants is a military option in this kind of situation,"" said Secretary of State John Kerry. U.S. officials say they are trying to find a way to deescalate the situation in Ukraine rather than provoke a wider conflagration. But the situation would become a more complicated if Russia moves troops beyond Crimea into other parts of Ukraine, risking an all-out war with Kiev. Some people are suggesting measures that include a military element but don't go as far as direct confrontation. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called for the revival of plans for a NATO missile defense shield in Poland that Russia had strongly opposed. What is Russia's interest in Ukraine? What are the wider effects of the crisis? The standoff has had a significant effect in global markets, pushing up the price of oil. Russia is a key exporter of oil and natural gas. But experts say the world's need for Russian energy supplies -- and Russia's need for the revenue generated -- should ensure the taps stay open throughout the crisis. Concerns over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine has hurt Russia's currency, the ruble, as well as its stock markets. The share prices of international companies that are heavily invested in Russia have also suffered. Ukraine, meanwhile, is one of the world's top exporters of corn and wheat, whose prices could rise on concern those exports could come to a halt. What is Ukraine saying? Ukraine's Interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who has accused Moscow of declaring war, vowed that his government would not give up Crimea. ""Nobody will give Crimea away,"" he said. ""There are no grounds for the use of force against civilians and Ukrainians, and for the entry of the Russian military contingent,"" Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said that if diplomacy fails to persuade Moscow to withdraw its forces from the Ukrainian region of Crimea, the world should apply the ""strongest means"" on Russia. Asked by CNN's Christiane Amanpour if she was calling for the West to use military force against Russia, Tymoshenko avoided giving a direct answer, saying she ""cannot solve this issue."" Russia says that ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Moscow still recognizes as the country's legitimate leader, requested that Russia send in military forces. What is the atmosphere like in Crimea? Reporters on the ground say the standoff is a strange one. Russian soldiers wearing no military insignia have taken up positions around the region. They have blockaded Ukrainian troops in their bases. But for the time being, the situation remains surprisingly calm. It has been ""a very low-key kind of invasion,"" CNN correspondent Diana Magnay reported Monday from Simferopol, the Crimean capital. But Russian forces ""have complete operational control of the Crimean peninsula,"" a senior U.S. administration official told CNN. It appears that there is a ""war of information"" in the region ""between those who watch Russian state TV and those who are getting their news from the West, none of them listening to the calls from Kiev for unity in this country,"" Magnay reported.","The presence of Russian troops in Ukraine's Crimea has ratcheted up tensions .
U.S. President Barack Obama appears to have limited options to pressure Russia .
A military response isn't considered to be a realistic possibility .
The crisis is roiling global markets, pushing up the price of oil and hurting the ruble ."
"(CNN) -- Spain's Marc Marquez claimed a 10th pole position in 12 attempts this season at qualifying for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Saturday. The Honda rider, who currently leads the MotoGP championship by 77 points, was 0.311 faster than his nearest rival, Italy's Andrea Dovizioso. The Ducati rider was narrowly quicker than Jorge Lorenzo who finished third -- the Spaniard will be looking to complete a third successive victory at the Silverstone circuit. Lorenzo's compatriot Aleix Espargaro is one place further back in fourth with Marquez's nearest rival in the title race, Dani Pedrosa, finishing qualifying in fifth. Marquez, who became the sport's youngest world champion last year, has utterly dominated 2014 winning the opening 10 races. The only blot on an otherwise perfect season came at the Czech Republic MotoGP earlier this month where he finished fourth.

"(CNN) -- Christina McHale, energy sapped and unable to train properly, knew something was wrong last year. Exercises she once did easily were becoming harder and getting through matches was proving difficult, too. It was a surprise, since the young American prospect was considered a player with good stamina and has already earned a reputation for wearing down her opponents, not vice versa. After a first-round victory at the French Open, McHale felt particularly exhausted. ""I won 6-4 in the third set, but I remember saying to my coach that I feel like I've just been hit by a bus,"" the 21-year-old recalled. At first she thought it was a sinus infection. Then a couple of months later, following the Olympic tennis event at Wimbledon, McHale picked up a stomach bug and had to go to hospital. Her ordeal dragged on. ""I kept going back to the doctors because I wasn't getting better,"" McHale said. ""I was still feeling very low on energy and they were like, 'No, you should already be over the stomach virus.' So then they started doing more tests, and that's when they found out what it was."" The diagnosis was mononucleosis, a viral illness that can linger for weeks, months or even years. It has earned the nickname of the ""kissing disease"" because it can get passed from one person to another through saliva. Fortunately for McHale, her bout was coming to an end. McHale, though, isn't the only tennis player in recent years to be afflicted with mono or the name it's also known by, glandular fever. Others on the list . Top men's players Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Robin Soderling, Mario Ancic and John Isner have been struck down, while Heather Watson, like McHale a player with promise, revealed she had mono in April. Jarmila Gajdosova, another promising player on the women's tour, announced last week on Twitter that she had mono. Soderling and Ancic weren't as lucky as the likes of Federer, McHale and Watson, who hopes to return to action at the French Open, which starts this weekend. Indeed the severity of cases varies, as does an individual's capacity to fight off and cope with infections. Soderling, the French Open finalist in 2009 and 2010, hasn't played since 2011 and it is looking increasingly likely that he won't ever come back. The Swede with the massive forehand -- who handed Rafael Nadal his only defeat at Roland Garros -- started to feel unwell in the spring of 2011 and later said it was a mistake to compete at Wimbledon that year. Ancic, hailed as a potential winner at Wimbledon after reaching the semifinals in 2004, attempted to play through his flu-like symptoms during a Davis Cup series against Germany in 2007. He said he felt so dizzy in his singles opener he missed a ball completely, but he still contested the doubles a day later. He was ready to play the deciding fifth rubber if needed, although with Germany already clinching the tie he was replaced by a young Marin Cilic. ""God saved me,"" Ancic, known for his work ethic and willingness to play through injuries, said in an interview in 2007. Ancic re-emerged on the tour but was never the same and a teary-eyed Croatian had to retire two years ago aged 26. Andy Murray, the current world No. 2, feared he had mono four years ago, and it's an illness he's still wary of, telling the Daily Telegraph in March: ""You can get run down and end up missing two or three months of the year because of an illness. ""Your immune system gets run down and then you lose weight. It's happened with a lot of guys with glandular fever the last few years so it's something everyone has to look into."" Continuous travel, training . Former pro Justin Gimelstob isn't surprised that tennis players are susceptible. The players have to, at times, switch continents on a weekly basis, and they travel 10-11 months in a year. Unlike golf, cricket or Formula One, others sports that require continual global travel, the players also push themselves to the limit physically. The career of Gimelstob, who now commentates and serves as a player representative on the ATP World Tour's board of directors, was blighted by a back injury. ""I think that's the thing people don't understand -- the heightened intensity does damage to your body, immune system, energy levels, on the fitness of your muscles, ligaments, tendons,"" Gimelstob said. ""It's just a very tough sport. I truly believe that Nadal, Murray, (Novak) Djokovic and Federer, these guys aren't only the best tennis athletes in the world, they are some of the best athletes in the world. ""There's a whole culture of being tough and strong and pushing through pain and being a warrior. ""But I can tell you right now at 37 years old walking my dog, my body feels the brunt of probably doing a lot of things and pushing through barriers I probably shouldn't have. That's the product of an individual sport."" At first Leslie Findley, a consultant neurologist in England who has treated marathon runners, footballers and tennis players with mono, said it was a ""myth"" that those involved in tennis are more vulnerable than other athletes. But he subsequently acknowledged that when factoring in their travel, the severity of the illness can intensify. ""We know people with fatigue illnesses related to the effects of viruses travel badly,"" he said. ""If you take someone with a chronic fatigue syndrome and stick them on an airplane at (London's) Heathrow to the United States they'll do an eight-hour flight. That can have a devastating effect on them for days afterwards."" Preventing mono can be difficult, but Findley said it's important that players heed warnings. If they suddenly develop a cold, fever, sore throat or stomach issues, it's vital to rest instead of continuing to train and play matches. Stopping not easy . As Gimelstob pointed out and Findley knows through his own experience in working with sportsmen and women, that isn't always easy. ""When you and I have the flu, we go to bed and within a week or two we'd be back to normal,"" Findley said. ""Why these people get symptoms that go on for weeks, months and years is usually because -- and I'm now generalizing -- they don't stop when they have the first symptoms and tend to push through, and they're under stress."" Diagnosing mono isn't simple, either, said Findley. He said there is a lack of specialists and that doing a battery of tests at the outset may not be efficient. He will usually spend nearly two hours talking to patients in a first consultation before making a clinical diagnosis. ""Then there are a limited number of blood tests that need to be done to make sure there is nothing else contributing to it,"" Findley said. The women's tennis tour said in an email that player health and well being was a ""priority."" But the age of many of its pros is another reason why tennis players would appear to be at risk. ""Mononucleosis most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 15 and 24, which is our athlete population,"" said Kathleen Stroia, senior vice president, sport sciences and medicine & transitions, with the WTA. The men's tour said in an email that mono ""has not been of unusual concern for the players or the ATP Medical Services."" ""Professional athletes are not immune to illnesses which affect the general public in general,"" said Gary Windler, medical advisor to the ATP World Tour. ""While we are concerned about and take all injuries and illness seriously, and although some high profile players have suffered from glandular fever in recent years, the incidence of this particular illness amongst our players in general has not been unusually high."" McHale didn't think her tour needed to do more to help players. ""I think we're probably more susceptible to getting it because our bodies are more run down from traveling so much,"" she said. ""Also sometimes I take a water bottle -- they all look the same -- to the court and all of a sudden I'm like, 'This wasn't my water bottle.' Sometimes it gets transferred like that. ""I know a lot of my friends have gotten it. They're not athletes. For them it wasn't a big issue. It's amplified when you're an athlete."" Tough comeback for McHale . Her road back hasn't been smooth. McHale, like others before her, didn't stop playing for a while. But after losing five straight matches, she finally decided to sit out the remainder of 2012 and not contest the European indoor swing. The losing streak rose to eight by the time this January's Australian Open ended. As high as No. 24 in the world last summer, her health issues largely contributed to her ranking sliding to 55th. She has resumed training fully and played for nearly three hours against 2012 French Open finalist Sara Errani in Rome on Wednesday but knows she must be careful. ""They did tell me there's a chance I could get a relapse, so I have to take it easy if I'm feeling extremely exhausted,"" she said. ""But I think I'm past that point. I don't feel any side effects of what I had. I feel like I'm fully over it now. I was lucky my case wasn't extremely bad like some others.""","Some of tennis' biggest names, including Roger Federer, have been felled by mono .

"(CNN) -- What's in a gesture? A gesture of support for a friend, a gesture that is ""anti-system,"" says French footballer Nicolas Anelka, who chose to celebrate his goal-scoring performance in an English Premier League game last weekend with a movement that has sparked controversy not just in the sporting world but also the political. Known as the ""quenelle,"" it involves pointing the right arm straight down and touching that arm with the left hand. Anelka explained that Saturday's celebration was nothing more than a nod to his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who has popularized the gesture in France. But others believe the gesture is a Nazi salute in reverse, and it has been linked to rising anti-Semitism in France -- a charge over which Dieudonne faces an investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office. During a performance, Dieudonne said of a prominent Jewish journalist: ""Me, you see, when I hear Patrick Cohen speak, I think to myself: 'Gas chambers ... too bad (they no longer exist)."" Whatever you think the ""quenelle"" is, Anelka and Dieudonne are provoking huge controversy on both sides of the English channel. There have been demands that English football's governing body severely punishes the former France international forward. In France, Dieudonne's right to perform his controversial show has become a touchstone for ""freedom of speech"" advocates. Fractured society . ""This gesture was just a special dedication to my comedian friend Dieudonne,"" Anelka explained on his Twitter page as accusations of anti-Semitism seethed around him following the match between his club West Bromwich Albion and West Ham. ""(The) meaning (of) quenelle: anti-system. I do not know what the word religion has to do with this story! ""Of course, I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic."" Anelka is not the only sports star to be embroiled in controversy as photographs emerged of other French athletes -- basketball superstar Tony Parker plus footballers Samir Nasri and Mamadou Sakho, who like Anelka play in England -- making the ""quenelle."" All three have apologized for any offense caused. But the furore has shone a light on signs of an increasingly fractious French society. Daniel Makonnen, spokesman for LICRA -- International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism -- which is fighting fighting racial discrimination, told CNN that there was a 59% rise in anti-Semitic attacks in 2012. According to the French Interior Ministry, there were 1,539 racist and anti-Semitic attacks in 2012, a rise of 22%. He also explained that Anelka's use of the ""quenelle"" blurred the lines between what is anti-establishmentarianism and anti-Semitism. ""It is a way of Anelka boosting his image as a controversial person,"" Makonnen said. ""In France people are taking sides. Are you for or against establishment? The fact that Anelka is doing the quenelle... ""Originally it was used by Dieudonne in his first shows. But the 'quenelle' has been used in front of Auschwitz and in front of the (Jewish) school in Toulouse,"" added Makonnen, referring to the Ohr Torah school where three children and a teacher were murdered last year. ""If you look closer these people say they are willing to fight the system, but it's a system they say is controlled by Jewish people."" Powder keg . Philippe Auclair, the England correspondent of France Football magazine, said that Anelka and Nasri's support for anti-establishment views were very much in vogue in France. ""The idea that you are against the system invariably means that you are against anyone who disagrees with your point of view,"" he told CNN. ""It has little to do with social or ethnic origin. You have young, white middle-class men and women saying the same thing. ""When I go back to France it is like there are two parallel universes; a government that is widely perceived as incompetent, with a social situation that is like a powder keg. ""Ultra-nationalism is on the rise and it has become completely acceptable to be openly anti-Semitic and to say that there is a global Zionist conspiracy."" Anelka also received short shrift from another French sports writer Erik Bielderman. ""Anelka portrays himself as an anti-establishment hero but this is an anti-establishment hero who is pictured emerging from his Rolls-Royce at the entrance to London Heliport and has appeared in an advert in France for the hamburger restaurant chain Quick,"" wrote Bielderman in Britain's Daily Mail newspaper. Dieudonne congratulated Anelka on Twitter for using the ""quenelle"" to celebrate his goal against West Ham, which has a zero-tolerance policy on anti-Semitic chants at its stadium -- prompted by racist abuse the club's fans aimed at the supporters of London rival Tottenham in 2012. The 46-year-old Dieudonne, who ran in the European elections as an anti-Zionist, has been fined several times in France for anti-Semitic commentary. The French government said this month it wants to ban his live performances. ""Dieudonne uses anti-Semitic discourse in his shows in the sense of fighting Zionism,"" Makonnen explained. ""He says he has Jewish friends. He is against Zionists who he says have power. ""He releases videos on YouTube and gets millions of views in 24 hours. YouTube is subject to American law. If those videos were published under French law those videos would be deleted. ""Dieudonne is very popular. He is very smart. People say it is hard to speak your mind in France because political power is too strong."" Meanwhile Anelka must wait to hear what the English Football Association decides to do. ""The club fully acknowledges that Nicolas' goal celebration has caused offense in some quarters and has asked Nicolas not to perform the gesture again. Nicolas immediately agreed to adhere to this request,"" his employer West Bromwich Albion said on Monday. What's in a gesture? Anelka could yet find out to his cost.","French footballer Nicolas Anelka has caused a storm by using the ""quenelle"" gesture as a goal celebration .

"(CNN) -- When Florence Griffith-Joyner signed up for her 1988 Olympic 100 meter trial in Indianapolis, few expected fireworks. But those who were there to witness her quarterfinal run couldn't comprehend what they were seeing. Flo Jo, as she would later become known, had been a good, but not exceptional, 200 meter sprinter over the past seven years. She had failed to qualify for the boycotted 1980 Moscow Olympics but had won silver at the Los Angeles games four years later. She hadn't run the 100 meters, not seriously, until now. The next ten-and-a-half seconds encapsulated everything that would define Flo Jo for the rest of her life . Speed, elegance, beauty, femininity, suspicion. She got off to an indifferent start but at 60 meters found a different gear and destroyed the field in a way unseen in women's sprinting. By the time she crossed the finishing line she had recorded a time of 10.49 seconds, almost four hundredths of a second quicker than her previous best before the trial, and a new world record. She had smashed it wearing her self-designed, one-legged jump suit and sporting her trademark mane of dark hair and long, painted finger nails. The commentator on American TV was dumbstruck. ""I...it can't be, nobody can run that fast,"" he stuttered when hearing the anemometer had recorded a legal wind speed. ""They must have done something to the electronics because she won by such a margin ... it might be right but 10.4(9) ... is incredible."" But the electronics, even if there was a suspicion of a fault, were deemed infallible and the record stood. The taint of drugs . Looking back at that moment her husband and then coach, the Olympic gold medal winning triple jumper Al Joyner, laughs when he recalls the reaction to the record. ""At first, when she beat the record, they said it was wind assisted,"" he exasperated. ""Later when she won the medals they said it was drugs."" The run was a prelude to that other unforgettable sprint performance at Seoul. Ben Johnson's brutal world record and subsequent ban for testing positive for steroids cast a long shadow over the Games, and an even longer one over Flo Jo. She won gold in the 100 and 200 meters. In any era she would be hailed as the greatest of all time, a sprinter who transformed her discipline in the same way Usain Bolt has transformed his. But her improvement was so great, her times so exceptional, the change in her physique so profound that, for most, drugs -- steroids -- was the only answer. ""It was jealousy,"" Joyner tells CNN, denying that Flo Jo ever took drugs. ""I trained her like a man. We did a lot of things then that they do now with nutrition. The things that separated her were her mental focus and toughness. She was humble. My wife was great then and she is great now."" A humble start . Florence Griffith was the seventh of eleven children brought up in Jordan Downs, a run-down public housing complex in Los Angeles. Her running ability at 200 and 400 meters got her to college but she dropped out to become a bank clerk and part time hair stylist to support her family. It was only when she managed to secure a meager sponsorship that she could start to take running seriously. Joyner still vividly remembers seeing his future wife for the first time. ""I met her at the U.S. Olympic trial in 1980. It was 6.45pm. I remember that because I never saw a woman look like that before; she made me speechless,"" he recalls. ""Jackie [Joyner-Kersee, his Olympic gold medal winning sister] was going through UCLA. Eventually I came back out to train. I'm doing distance running. So we start running together and started being friends. She's was not only beautiful, but she could run. I thought I could run off and leave her but I couldn't shake her."" The two married in 1987 and it was this emotional and financial stability that Joyner credits, in part, to the huge jump that Flo Jo made between that year and 1988. ""Florence gave a lot of her love. I was the person that gave the love back,"" he says. ""She needed to know trust and faith and belief."" The other ingredient, according to Joyner, was purchased in a local K-Mart. ""We bought a $150 leg exercise machine and she did leg curls every night. More than 20 lbs every night to build up the strength in her legs. She was working 12 hours a day."" Seoul 1988 . Flo Jo's incredible run at the U.S. Olympic Trials had made her an object of suspicion when she arrived at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, compounded by the shocking news of Ben Johnson's fall from grace. Her preparations hadn't been great. She ran an 11 second plus time at a meeting in Sweden and then, according to Joyner ""10.89 in Gateshead, London (sic)."" Although, on closer examination, that was into a headwind and was still as fast as British sprinter Linford Christie could muster, the man who won silver in the men's 100 meters. But Flo Jo breezed through the heats at the Games, recording a clean sweep of sub-11 second times when she won a wind assisted final in 10.54 seconds. Again she had an average start but burst free at 60 meters, annihilating the rest of the field. She was handed the Stars and Stripes and headed towards her husband. ""I feel so good that it's over,"" she said moments afterward. ""I wasn't chasing the time, I was chasing the win. A gold, that's the first for me at the Olympics and I just thank God that it's over."" Al Joyner was beaming by her side. ""Seeing my wife run 10.54..."" he said, still a little shocked. ""I predicted 10.57 but she always wants to run a little ahead of me. It brought tears to me."" But behind the scenes the suspicion had led to a string of drug tests for Flo Jo, tests which Joyner used as motivation for his wife. ""She was being tested and I felt people were trying to get into her head, I had to keep her focused,"" he says. ""I told her: ""Go out there and run like you on jet fuel."" Her next run in the 200 meters was even more remarkable. She smashed her own world record. Both her 100 and 200 meter records still stand today, unbroken. ""We performed all possible and imaginable analyses on her,"" the president of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission, Prince Alexandre de MÃ©rode, said at the time. ""We never found anything. There should not be the slightest suspicion."" A clean slate? Florence Griffith-Joyner never did fail a drugs test. Seoul would be her last Olympics. She retired afterward with a press conference at Madison Square Garden. Her detractors point to the fact she retired just as compulsory random drug testing was being introduced. But Joyner insists she left the sport to have a family. Her only daughter was born in 1990. Talk of a comeback at the 1996 Olympics came and then went when she had a seizure that same year. Two years later she died in her sleep. She was 38 years old. ""We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent and captivated by her style,"" President Clinton said. ""That was September 21, I was getting ready to take my daughter to school and I hear my wife's alarm clock,"" recalls Joyner, who refers to Flo Jo in the present tense throughout. ""I turn off the alarm clock and my wife's not moving. It was devastating looking at my daughter. She was seven. When I see the Olympic Games now it brings joy to me, all her hard work. They can say what they want to say."" Flo Jo had suffocated during an epileptic seizure. At first her death at such a young age seemed to prove the suspicion of steroid use. There was intense interest in the autopsy. ""I had to do my grieving in front of the whole world,"" says Joyner, only finding any measure of comfort ""30 days later after my wife's autopsy."" The results in death, just as in life, had proven Flo Jo right. There was no conclusive proof of drug use. ""I told the doctor, they checked for everything,"" he says. ""They had people coming up all the time wanting to do tests. My wife passed the ultimate drugs test."" Taking back Fl Jo . Florence Griffith Joyner is rarely mentioned without an invisible asterisk next to her name when the women's 100 and 200 meters comes around in Olympic year. Current runners bemoan the unreachable bench mark she set. Double Olympic 200 meter gold medalist Veronica Campbell Brown got nowhere near it, saying it was beyond her reach. Former 200 meter Olympic champion Gwen Torrence said that she ""did not acknowledge those records ... To me they don't exist and women sprinters are suffering as a result of what she did to the times in the 100 and 200."" Yet her impact on the sport is there for all to see. ""Every time you see a woman in the 100 or 200 meters with make-up and nails, that's Florence,"" says Joyner of his wife's legacy. ""She did it with style and she did it with speed. She was in a class by herself especially for all the women she opened the door for. Her star will always shine. And it has the right to shine.""","Florence Griffith-Joyner shocked the world when she won 100 and 200m gold at Seoul 1988 .

"(CNN) -- After President Barack Obama said he didn't yet have a strategy for ISIS in Syria, even a Democrat on Sunday criticized the President's approach to fighting the extremist terror group. There's been the expected GOP criticism: Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, said the President's statement was ""unfortunate,"" a predictable assessment from someone who disagrees with the Obama's handling of foreign policy. But more notable is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who split with the leader of her party. ""I think I've learned one thing about this President and that is he's very cautious. Maybe in this instance, too cautious,"" the California Democrat said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Feinstein's description comes as the Obama administration is implementing a split strategy in dealing with the group now calling itself the Islamic State. In Iraq, where America recently concluded a long war there, the United States has continued airstrikes against ISIS, including strikes near Amerli Saturday. In Syria, meanwhile, the President has been reluctant to pursue military action as a complicated web of factions, including ISIS, is fighting to defeat President Bashar al-Assad, also a U.S. opponent. The threat . While members of both parties indicated that Syria is the most dangerous country in the world right now as it is considered ISIS' home base, Republicans differed from Democrats in that they insisted that the threat ISIS poses to the U.S. is immediate. ""I believe strongly that ISIS does plan on attacking the United States,"" Rep. Peter King said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment on ISIS in Syria sparks a political uproar . Sen. John McCain went even further on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"": ""I think it starts with an understanding that this is a direct threat to the United States of America, that it may be one of the biggest we have ever faced."" The top Republicans' statements come just days after British Prime Minister David Cameron elevated the terror threat to ""severe,"" the second-highest rating for that country. But the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, played down the immediacy of a direct attack in the United States on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying strong intelligence ""at this point"" of an imminent attack on the U.S. does not exist. Another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, acknowledged the threat ISIS poses is real, but it's ""a bit of an overstatement"" to compare the threat of ISIS to al Qaeda. ""There is no evidence at this point that they are actually doing the sort of command-and-control plotting, planning specific attacks against Western targets, like al Qaeda was, gosh, for better -- for almost a decade before 9/11,"" he said on ""Face the Nation."" 'A cancer' Kinzinger used a cancer analogy describing ISIS, expanding upon an opinion piece written by Secretary of State John Kerry in The New York Times Friday when he said ""the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries."" ""If you have cancer in your liver, and it's spreading to other parts of your body, you don't just treat the other parts, you treat the liver,"" the Iraq War veteran said on CNN's ""State the Union."" ""The liver is Syria."" While the President has been taking heat for saying he doesn't have a strategy for ISIS, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee discussed the challenges in formulating a strategy, in part, because obtaining intelligence about ISIS from war-torn Syria has been difficult. ""We have got to get the intelligence,"" Ruppersberger said. Smith echoed his colleague's sentiment. ""We can't simply bomb first and ask questions later. We have to have the right targets and the right support in order to be effective in stopping ISIS,"" he said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" On Friday, Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Connecticut, and others sent a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, asking that committee members return to Washington ahead of schedule in order to oversee Obama's response to ISIS and the possible expansion of airstrikes. ""We are very concerned that due to the speed with which events are happening, waiting until September 8th for Congress to reconvene effectively sidelines our constitutional role. We respectfully request that the Armed Services Committee reconvene as early as possible to provide the needed oversight over this new development,"" they wrote. In response, a spokesman for McKeon said the chairman appreciates the sense of urgency and that oversight can take a variety of forms. ""Currently the chairman and other members of the committee are traveling in the Middle East, consulting regional leaders on this important issue. A classified briefing for committee members -- covering ISIS as well as the events in the Ukraine -- is scheduled for the Tuesday members return,"" said Claude Chafin. Military action now -- or soon . Most Republicans, including McCain, are urging immediate airstrikes in Syria, the place where the terrorist group gained traction with its brutal tactics and mostly erasing the border between the Syria and Iraq. The Arizona Republican joined Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who opened the door last week to putting more U.S. troops in Iraq. McCain said that a comprehensive strategy to defeating ISIS ""is going to require some more special forces."" Ruppersberger was among the Democrats who urged a broad strategic plan that leaves the door open for a variety of actions, which is the message put out by the Obama administration over the past two days, including in Kerry's opinion piece. ""If we need to go ... to protect ourselves from ISIS, we will, but it's got to be a coalition,"" Ruppersberger said on ""State of the Union."" Democrats insisted that building an international coalition in the region and beyond is the first step. ""We have to build that coalition,"" Smith said. ""We need reliable partners to work with in the region."" But Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, said the President should have been building that coalition for the past year. ""It's just very, very late in the game and it presents fewer options,"" Rogers said on ""Fox News Sunday."" U.N. counts 3 million Syria refugees .","NEW: Rep.

"(Budget Travel) -- The following five sites have proven the most consistently useful for the editors of Budget Travel, who do thousands of searches a year. Budget Travel editors reveal favorite online resources to book flights, hotels and other needs. Dohop.com . Strictly for booking plane trips entirely outside of the U.S., such as a flight between Paris and Rome. The site runs simultaneous searches of multiple airports serving the same city -- five airports in London, for instance -- and it retrieves fares from no-frills independent carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair, which many better-known travel sites overlook. That said, be warned that Dohop doesn't work nearly as well for booking airfares leaving the U.S. Kayak.com . The all-time best site for finding the cheapest plane tickets in the U.S. Our biggest beef with Kayak's competitors is that when you click to book a fare, they typically direct you to a new page. Sometimes it's only then that you find out your actual departure time -- or worse, you're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again, only to discover far different results. Kayak stands apart. Once you've found a good flight on Kayak, click on the price and you'll be sent directly to the airline's Web site, where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears. Another perk: If you are flexible on your travel dates, we recommend you try Kayak's flexible-date search tool, which covers the broadest scope of routes and airports of any site we've tested. Budget Travel: Staying in touch while on the road . Priceline.com . The granddaddy discounter helps hotels, car-rental agencies, and airlines unload all sorts of inventory at well below published prices. We admit that Priceline's name-your-own-price option -- in which travelers don't know specific details until after their bids have been accepted -- isn't for everyone. But as flexible travelers, we're fans of using Priceline to bid blindly. You'll find the best results when bidding for upscale hotels in large cities, paying up to half off what other guests pay. The trade-off is that your hotel's location will be something of a surprise. But in many big cities, it doesn't really matter which neighborhood you're staying in, because you're hopping all over town sightseeing anyway. Of course, Priceline also sells travel the straightforward way (with the price and details quoted up-front), but, in our opinion, it's no better at doing that than Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz or CheapTickets. TripAdvisor.com . Harnessing the power of the masses, the user-hotel-review site TripAdvisor is the top way to hunt for hotels. We admit that the site's spectrum of good, bad and mixed reviews for the same property can be confusing. But you know what? After reading the reviews and disregarding ones that seem off or biased, you get a decent sense of what to expect in a hotel -- which is the point. For now, TripAdvisor is the top dog in user-generated hotel reviews, but we're also watching Kayak-owned TravelPost, a newly-launched site that offers a similar service (though to date it posts only about one-tenth as many reviews and opinions as TripAdvisor). Venere.com . Spotlights independently owned properties overseas, many of which never show up on American travel sites. Any booking site can point you to large, widely known hotels. But you might prefer to stay in a charming inn or a small property on your next trip, especially if you're traveling to Europe. Well, Venere is the go-to source for this type of mom-and-pop lodging, which usually provides better value for the money than hotel chains. A recent search on Venere for hotels in Nice, France, for example, turned up 20 spots charging nightly rates of less than 60 euros ($82). That's well below the typical rates for large hotels in the resort town. Venere also offers other kinds of alternative lodging, such as apartments, pensions and farmhouses.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is vowing to stay put despite protests against his government that have enveloped the nation's capital. On Saturday, police fired tear gas on protesters after thousands of them threatened to march on the Prime Minister's house in Islamabad. At least 158 people were admitted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the hospital said. A 24-year-old man was in critical condition after being hit in the head by a rubber bullet. After failing to negotiate a solution with the protest movements, Sharif on Thursday asked the country's powerful military for help brokering an end to the crisis. ""Tear gas is a normal practice undertaken all over the world to disperse a crowd. It is something that is an alternative to using force,"" Pakistan Defense Minister Khwaja Asif told CNN. ""The situation had precipitated to a point that if action had not been taken then it would have been a free fall for the government."" At least 8,000 people have rallied in the city's center after allegations of vote-rigging during last year's election. Negotiations between Sharif's government and his opponents, some of whom are calling for his resignation, have reached an impasse. Sharif announced in a statement on Saturday that he will not resign -- a demand he has called ""unconstitutional."" Leading the two week-long protests are Imran Khan -- an enigmatic former cricket star who leads one of Pakistan's largest political parties -- and outspoken cleric Tahir ul Qadri, an outspoken cleric who wants to overhaul the country's political system. Khan is demanding new elections, while Qadri is demanding much more sweeping reforms. As the protests have grown in size and scope, the army has stationed personnel at government buildings in case protesters try to occupy them. A spokesman for Qadri said that protests tried to enter the road leading to the Prime Minister's residence. Asif said that no decision had been made on whether to arrest Khan or Qadri. ""They violated their original commitment with the government to protest in a designated space like it is done in civilized countries,"" Asif said. ""We cannot trust them."" CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad and Joshua Berlinger reported and wrote from Atlanta. Journalist Adeel Raja in Islamabad contributed to this report.","Police fire tear gas after thousands of protesters threaten to march on PM's house .

"(CNN) -- Christian Sylt is the co-author of Formula Money, an annual report examining all aspects of Formula One's finances with detailed data on teams, drivers, sponsors and races. Here, he answers key questions about F1's financial model. Who owns F1? Christian Sylt: The actual Formula One Group -- the companies that own the commercial rights to F1 -- is made up of multiple companies. We are talking about 30-40. They invest in multiple jurisdictions -- the UK, Jersey, Luxembourg, Switzerland, all over the place -- but the parent company of the group is called Delta Topco and they are based in Jersey. So, the owners of that you could say are the ultimate owners. It is 35.5% owned by a private equity firm called CVC Capital Partners. The second biggest shareholder is an American company called Waddell and Reed -- they have got in the region of 20%. The third biggest shareholder is the estate of Lehman Brothers -- they have somewhere in the region of 12%. Bernie Ecclestone's family trust has circa 10% and Ecclestone himself has around 5%. It's a complicated structure. How well is F1 doing financially? CS: F1 is incredible really. I've never seen a company like F1 in terms of revenue generating potential. Over the past five years we've had one/two recessions and its revenues and profits have gone up. The revenues last year were $1.6 billion, 2011 was definitely $1.5 billion. Going back to 2007/08 it was in the region of $1.2 billion. It's gone up significantly. How is that money generated? CS: Generally speaking, $500 million comes from the fees that promoters pay to host races and then another $500 million comes from the fees that broadcasters pay to screen the sport. Then you have circa $250 million coming from sponsorship -- trackside advertisers and series sponsors. The remaining $250 million is coming from things like corporate hospitality. What's the secret of its economic success? CS: The key driver of the growth is the fees that come from the circuits ($500 million). Most of these contracts include clauses that increase the rate by up to 10% annually. It's a clever strategy because if you look at the secrets to F1's success you can identify several key points. The move to Asia is one. It wasn't done out of desire, it was much more out of necessity, although I'm sure Ecclestone would say he wanted to go to these countries. Maybe he did. The F1 calendar is restricted to 20 races a year -- teams refuse to agree to more races -- which makes it difficult to exponentially increase revenues. So what Ecclestone did was take races to emerging markets. It became apparent to countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, China, India and South Korea that hosting a Formula One race is a good way to put their country on the global sporting map. F1 is the most watched sport in the world -- 500 million viewers a year -- so this is a good way to get your country seen on TV, drive tourism and make yourself look credible alongside other sporting nations. Do different races pay different fees? CS: Bigtime. For example, Monza (Italian Grand Prix) you are talking single digits whereas Singapore you are talking in the region of $60 million. Malaysia pays $66.9 million a year. The average fee for hosting is now $27 million and that's driven by these new Asian races. The bottom line with many of the Asia races is that the government will cover the fee because it's promoting the country whereas in Europe, Germany (for example) doesn't need a Formula One race to promote itself. How much of F1 profits go to the teams? CS: Essentially, 47.5% of the profits are split between all of the teams. That is what is known as the prize fund. In 2011, profits came to $1.1, 1.2 billion so 47.5% of that amounts to around $400-500 million and that is shared between the top ten. It's not shared evenly, it's based on performance. In addition to that certain teams get additional money, with Ferrari being the key beneficiary with, as far as I know, 5% of profits all to itself. Then there are two or three funds which are split between the best performing teams -- which generally tend to be Ferrari, McLaren and Red Bull. The top teams are given that bonus because they have the heritage and the prestige. It's actually an incredibly clever strategy because the reality of the matter is that the majority of the other F1 teams have changed names at least once in the past five years. Caterham was Lotus, Sauber was BMW, Sauber was Spyker. Nobody stopped watching F1 because (of these name changes), but if you get rid of Ferrari, McLaren or possibly now Red Bull that could cause trouble with the viewers. Why do Ferrari get special treatment? CS: Ferrari is F1's longest standing team. As far as I know it's the only team that has competed in every year of F1 championship. But critically Ferrari is the only manufacturer-owned team that directly signs contracts with F1 giving the owners more security. How are teams further down the grid faring? CS: There is a real risk of teams leaving F1 at the minute because they cannot sustain the competition in terms of funding their outfits. There are question marks over, basically, all the teams bar Ferrari, McLaren and Red Bull. How severe those question marks are is a moot point. Marussia put in its accounts that it was speaking to new investors in 2011 and when the accounts were filed in October 2012 they hadn't found any new investors. With Caterham the question mark is nothing more than the fact that they have not scored a point. Their owners have invested more money than any team in the history of any team in F1 to score no points. There were rumors this year that Sauber was looking to sell up before the recent Russian investment. Red Bull's junior team Toro Rosso was put on the market (in 2008) and taken off the market because there were no bidders. How long is Red Bull going to continue funding that team when it is nowhere near as successful as the other? How is sponsorship evolving? CS: What's increasingly happening is that sponsorship deals are being done with F1 owners. You have Rolex and Emirates in the last three/four months alone doing gigantic deals to sponsor F1. What you get as a F1 sponsor is numerous things. You get packages of trackside advertising around the circuit. Those are probably some of the best value sponsorships in the whole of sport. What sponsoring F1 offers over sponsoring a team is guaranteed exposure. If you're a team, you could crash out, do badly. Take a look at McLaren which is doing far worse this year than it did last. It's harder to build a case to invest in a team than it is to invest in F1. The fact is that F1 can grow, but it's very difficult for a team to expand. The bulk of a team's revenue comes from sponsorship. Teams exist to try and win races. F1 objective is to make profits. There is big difference between them. Where can we expect to see F1 races in the future? CS: Thailand is on the cards. Russia is a fact -- they are going (to Sochi) in 2014. Beyond that, there are so many countries knocking on the door. Hong Kong, South Africa, more races in North America -- Las Vegas is a strong possibility. Remarkably, Greece wants to host a race, but I don't think that will ever happen. What's your overall assessment of F1's finances? CS: The F1 Group is in better health than it ever has been. The (share) float (on the Singapore stock exchange) is pending. CVC (Capital Partners) are saying over the next 12 months pending clarity of Bernie Ecclestone's situation in Germany (the F1 boss was recently indicted by a German judge investigating allegations of bribery in the wake of the conviction of banker Gerhard Gribkowsky). Beyond that, it's a matter of timing. There are question marks over the majority of the teams but provided they stay afloat it doesn't really matter what guise they race under. Could another team drop? Yes. Ecclestone has said himself that 10 teams would be OK.","Formula One Group has more than doubled revenues over past decade .

"(CNN) -- David Duchovny's latest role is stirring up more intrigue than any episode of ""The X-Files."" The actor plays himself in a beer commercial imagining how proud he would be if he were Russian. ""And I found out that being Russian, I'd have many things to be proud of,"" he says in the video, which was posted Friday on the Russian beer Siberian Crown's YouTube page. A message in Russian was posted with the video. The Google translation of the message said that Duchovny ""decided to do a film about Russian pride and love of country."" The timing of the video, viewed at least 1.6 million times in the first three days, couldn't be more controversial, considering the international condemnation of Russia after a Malaysian airliner went down over eastern Ukraine this month, killing 298 people on board. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said a Russian-made missile system was used to shoot down the plane from rebel territory. Russia and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed Ukraine for the crash. ""This is the country where I was born and raised,"" Duchovny says at the start of the 2Â½-minute video. ""But there is another country, where I got my family name from. And sometimes I wonder: What if things turned out differently? What if I were Russian?"" But Duchovny's family emigrated from Ukraine, not Russia. He may not have known when he signed up for the commercial job earlier this year, but he apparently did before it was produced. ""I grew up thinking I was Russian only to find recently that I've been Ukrainian all along. Never too late to change,"" he said in a Twitter posting on April 4. The difference between Ukrainians and Russians is central to the struggle between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government. Ethnic Russian rebels in the east and south of Ukraine identify with Russia. Duchovny tweeted a photo on May 30, apparently taken while he was producing the scene where he imagined he was a Russian cosmonaut. ""Ground control to Major Ivan,"" he tweeted. He also imagines himself to be a Russian ballet choreographer, a Russian-speaking actor and a Russian rocker with a mullet. ""Could I still be among the stars?"" Duchovny asks in the video. ""How would I surround myself with beauty? What role could I have played? Would my smile be known the world over?"" Joshua Edwards, an assistant to Duchovny manager Melanie Greene, said Monday that Greene was working on a response to the controversy, but Edwards later said it would only be given to TMZ.","David Duchovny's Russian beer ad is released at an awkward time .

"(CNN) -- There's a lot to be said for determination. Two years ago, a contraption that looked a bit like a bouncy ball attached to a clothesline, took flight in a pioneering experiment in the German countryside. A YouTube clip of a man flying the electric ""Multicopter"" attracted over 8 million hits, with comments ranging from: ""AMAZING MACHINE!"" to ""Not sure you could pay me enough to sit in the middle of flying blenders bolted together."" Regardless, the three German engineers behind the baffling creation plowed ahead with their dream of making an electric helicopter. Last week it paid off. There wasn't a bouncy ball in sight as the slick white ""Volocopter"" took to the air for the first time, quietly hovering 20 meters high, while its ecstatic creators cheered below. Featuring 18 propellers on a lightweight carbon frame, the futuristic copter -- which has been around €4 million ($5.4 million) in the making -- could change the way we commute forever. ""What we're looking at now, is in the future where everyone is traveling not by car, but by some kind of aircraft,"" explained Stephan Wolf, co-chief executive of e-volo, the company behind the remarkable flying machine. ""Normal helicopters are very hard to fly. But we thought 'what if you could have a helicopter that is easy for the pilot to fly, and cheap compared to other aircraft?'"" Clever copter . Powered by a 100 kilogram battery, the two-passenger Volocopter can travel at least 70 kilometers per hour, recently making its first remote-controlled flight in a hanger in Karlsruhe, southwest Germany. The chopper weighs just 300 kilograms in total. One limitation is that it currently only has enough power to fly for 20 minutes -- though designers are looking at ways of increasing this, or introducing a hybrid engine. Many small rotors -- attached to a 10-meter wide circular frame -- also help the eco-friendly machine hover more easily than other helicopters. ""If you let the joystick go, the Volocopter will just hover in the current position, so there's nothing the pilot has to do,"" said Wolf. ""But if you do that in another helicopter it will crash immediately."" Reimagining the city . Indeed, the Volocopter's simplicity sets it apart from other helicopters, and its creators hope in the future commuters will be able to take their electric aircraft to work, instead of languishing in gridlocked cars below. The European Union is already looking at ways personal aerial vehicles (PAVs) could revolutionize urban spaces. It might sound like a scene from the Jetsons, but a city where flying machines replace cars isn't as far off as it seems. ""The most helicopters in the world are in Sao Paulo, Brazil,"" explained Wolf. ""They have several thousand movements per day because the streets are congested and everyone who can afford it is taking the helicopter to go from one building to the next. ""You can imagine this happening in a big city in Germany. And already we've been approached by several companies who'd like to do it, maybe with landing pads on buildings."" The team hopes to sell its first Volocopter by 2015, with each machine setting you back €250,000 ($338,000). They're now on the lookout for further funding to develop their unique design. Think big . It's a long way from the first awkward-looking Multicopter test flight in 2011. Even more impressive, considering Wolf himself was a computer software engineer for 25 years before turning his attention to futuristic flying machines -- ""I was dreaming of building a helicopter since I was a child,"" he said. Then there's the other e-volo founders -- Thomas Senkal, a former physicist, and Alexander Zosel, who managed a disco for almost 10 years, who also got on board the pioneering project. ""I think everyone wants to fly,"" said Wolf. ""Helicopters are very expensive and people think maybe this is a way to be a pilot themselves. ""In 20 or 30 years from now there will be even more cities with millions more people living in them and transportation will be a big problem. Maybe you need to go up in the air to solve these problems.""","Introducing e-volo's Volocopter: multi-rotor electric helicopter makes maiden flight .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A string of car bombings and shootings across Iraq left more than 50 people dead Monday, authorities said, in what is the latest spate of violence in a country plagued with Sunni-Shiite tension. Scores were wounded in cities that were regularly engulfed in violence during last decade's Iraq war. The violence in recent weeks has conjured fears that all-out sectarian violence is rearing its head again in Iraq. ""Those who are targeting mosques and other locations are the enemies of Sunnis and Shiite,"" Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said this weekend. ""They are plotting to ignite sectarian strife as they have tried before."" The ever-present tensions between Iraq's Sunnis and Shiites have escalated, especially after an incident last month in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Read more: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode . Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have been politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, now dominate the government. Al-Maliki, who is Shiite, is concerned about the rise of Sunni tribes forming an army to defend themselves and is urging Sunni leaders to help tamp down tensions. Sectarian violence erupts anew . ""We are in the planning stages to make changes within the (military) leaderships and adjusting plans to take different tactics for confrontation,"" he said. Police haven't pinpointed those responsible for assaults, but most victims in the latest round of strikes were Shiites. Read more: April the deadliest month in Iraq in 5 years . Most of the attacks Monday took place in the capital, Baghdad, where eight car bombs and a roadside bomb rocked predominately Shiite neighborhoods, police said. In all, at least 18 people were killed and more than 100 wounded the strikes, police and health officials said. Near Samarra, at least 14 people were killed and eight wounded when a car bomb exploded on a bus carrying Iranian Shiite pilgrims Monday, police said. That strike, on a highway near the northern Iraqi city, raised fears because of Samarra's symbolism. Shiites regularly travel to the Askariya Mosque in Samarra. The bombing of the Shiite shrine in 2006 stoked the sectarian warfare. In the southeastern city of Basra, in the Shiite heartland, at least nine people were killed and 37 wounded when two car bombs exploded Monday in a pair of neighborhoods. Most of the casualties were civilians, police said. It was unclear who was responsible for the blasts. Baghdad, Anbar province racked by violence . Gunmen ambushed two police checkpoints in Haditha on Monday, killing eight officers, Ramadi police said. Haditha is in the predominantly Sunni Anbar province, west of Baghdad. In Hilla, south of Baghdad in Babel province, at least nine people were killed and 53 others were wounded when a suicide bomber and a roadside bomb exploded outside Shiite mosques Monday evening. Over the weekend in Ramadi, the bodies of eight civilians who were kidnapped by gunmen Saturday were found, officials said. The civilians were abducted on a highway west of Ramadi, and their bodies were discovered late Sunday night along a different part of roadway, authorities said. All eight had been shot to death. Earlier, the bodies of six police officers who had also been abducted Saturday were found on a highway in western Ramadi. Read more: Iraq, on edge over violence, endures more bloodshed .

"(CNN) -- A June trial has been set for a Detroit-area man who said he accidentally shot and killed a 19-year-old woman he thought was breaking into his home. Theodore Paul Wafer, 54, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Wednesday to second-degree murder charges in connection with the November 2, 2013 shooting of Renisha McBride. Authorities said McBride was intoxicated and possibly disoriented following a car crash before Wafer shot her on his porch in the community of Dearborn Heights. The trial was set for June 2. Last month, District Court Judge David Turfe said there was enough probable cause for Wafer to stand trial in connection with the shooting. ""Defendant came to the door with the shotgun,"" Turfe said, according to CNN Michigan affiliate WXYZ. ""His first thought was to bring the gun, not call for help, or not answer the door. It suggests to this court, the defendant made a bad choice."" A friend of McBride told the court that she and the victim had been playing a drinking game with vodka and smoking marijuana the night of the shooting. Wafer, whose lawyer said he shot the victim in self-defense, was charged with second-degree murder last month after days of pressure from McBride's relatives seeking an arrest. He also was charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Wafer told investigators he thought McBride was breaking into his home, and that the shotgun accidentally discharged when he investigated, police said. McBride was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break-in, so Wafer -- who authorities say shot McBride from behind a closed, locked screen door -- cannot lawfully claim he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy told reporters in November. ""I am saying we do not believe he acted in lawful self-defense,"" Worthy said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Asia: Spread over one third of the world's surface, it is home to something like four billion people in 70 countries. It also produces half of the world's film. Niki Caro avoids all the coming-of-age cliches in ""Whale Rider."" Bollywood, the film industry of India's largest city, Mumbai, alone produces around 1,000 films each year -- almost two times as many as Hollywood. This vast continent doesn't just come out on top when it comes to output, it has also sired many influential directors, actors and film-genres. Ang Lee's 2000 homage to Chinese fantasy martial arts genre, Wuxia, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and Japan's unique take on horror, typified by films like Takashi Shimizu's ""Ju-on: The Grudge"" are just two examples of Asia's recent contribution to world film culture. We have included films by Japan's Akira Kurosawa, China's Wong Kar-Wai and India's Mehboob Khan in our provisional list of the best of Asian cinema but we want to hear from Web site users. What are your favorites? Have we missed one? Perhaps you don't agree with our choices.  Let us know in the Sound Off box below. 'In the Mood for Love' ('Fa yeung nin wa') Hong Kong/China (Wong Kar-Wai, 2000)  Wong was heavily influenced by Hitchcock's psychological thriller ""Vertigo"" during the making of this poetic, exquisitely shot meditation on love and loss starring Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung. It was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000. 'Mother India' ('Bharat Mata') India (Mehboob Khan, 1957) One of the sub-continent's first ever blockbusters, it is also known as India's ""Gone with the Wind."" Acting legend Nargis plays a woman who must raise her children single-handedly after her husband is maimed in an accident, and becomes the catalyst for her fellow villagers to fight for their land. It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 1957 Academy Awards -- India's first ever Oscar nomination. 'The Host' ('Gwoemul') South Korea (Bong Joon-ho, 2006) Arguably one of the greatest monster films ever made; a staggering 20 percent of the population of South Korea have watched this film. It is based on the true story of a U.S. military employee ordered to dump formaldehyde into the sewer system that leads to Seoul's Han River. Six years later a giant mutant squid starts attacking people (this part is made up). 'Syndromes and a Century' ('Sang sattawat') Thailand  (Apichatpong Weerasethakul, 2006)  One of seven films commissioned by the New Crowned Hope Festival, part of Vienna's Mozart Year in 2006. Set in two hospitals, Weerasthakul reflects on the lives and memories of his medic parents using an experimental, anti-narrative style (a series of images, soft spoken dialogue and music) which was chosen by the hugely influential French film magazine ""Les Cahiers du Cinéma"" as one of the 10 best pictures of 2007. 'Whale Rider' New Zealand (Niki Caro, 2002) At just 12 years-old star, Keisha Castle-Hughes was nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards for her extraordinary performance as ""Pai,"" a first-born female in the patriarchal Whangara tribe who believes she is destined to be the new Chief. 'Still Life' ('Sanxia haoren') China (Zhang Ke Jia, 2006)  Awarded a Golden Lion at Venice in 2006, this wide-sweeping film is based on the human tragedy of the Three Gorges Dam (more than one million people have been displaced) which stretches across the Yangtze River. The story focuses on a miner who travels back to his home town looking for his wife only to find that his former home is now submerged. The film illustrates the gulf between China's new world order and the soon-to-be-forgotten culture of the past. 'Shower' ('Xizao') China (Yang Zhang, 1999)  The richly humorous and touching story of Shenzhen businessman, Da Ming who returns home to Beijing where his father runs the local bathhouse, only to be caught between two cultures -- the decaying district of his childhood and the booming South where he now lives with a wife who has never met his family. When he realizes his father's health is failing, he must take stock. 'Shall we dansu?' Japan (Masayuki Suo, 1998) Successful but unhappy accountant, Shohei Sugiyama spots a beautiful woman in a dance studio window. Despite his wife and child, he secretly signs up for dance lessons hoping to get closer to her. Slowly he begins to fall in love with the art form itself. A 2004 Hollywood remake starred Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere. 'The Ballad of Narayama' ('Narayama bushiko') Japan (Keisuke Kinoshita,1958)  In a remote 19th century village, food is so scarce that when the elderly reach 70 years old they must climb frozen Mount Narayama to die so their families won't have to feed them. Kinoshita's film is profane and shocking at times. Throughout the film, images of couples having sex are interspersed with scenes of animals and insects mating. The film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984. 'Infernal Affairs' ('Mou gaan dou') Hong Kong/China (Andrew Lau Wai-Keung, Alan Mak Siu-Fai, 2002)  Hong Kong cop thriller following the parallel lives of an undercover officer who infiltrates a Triad gang and policeman who secretly reports to a ruthless gang boss. ""Infernal Affairs"" breaks the mould of much of contemporary Hong Kong cinema by steering clear of over-the-top-action in favor of a slow-burning build up of psychological tension. Engrossing. 'Mandala' South Korea (Kwon-Taek Im, 1981)  In the film that is considered to be his breakthrough as a cinematic artist, Im follows the lives and interactions of two Buddhist monks in Korea and takes a contemplative look at the nature of individualism, religious belief and enlightenment. 'To Live' ('Huozhe') China (Zhang Yimou, 1994)  Much lauded but banned in Mainland China because of its satirical portrayal of the Communist government, this epic, sumptuous film traces the personal fortunes of Fugui and Jiazhen as they fall from wealthy landownership to peasantry over 30 turbulent years. 'When the Tenth Month Comes' ('Bao gio cho den thang muoi') Vietnam (Dang Nhat Minh, 1984) A vivid portrayal from the point of view of a young Vietnamese widow of the legacy of the Vietnam war. It was released internationally under the name ""The Love Doesn't Come Back."" 'Himala' Philippines (Ishmael Bernal, 1982) Young Elsa thinks she has seen the Virgin Mary and goes on a healing crusade -- just the miracle the nowhere town she lives in is looking for. The film's austere camera work, haunting score and accomplished performances sensitively portray the harsh social and cultural conditions that people in the third world endure. 'A Touch of Zen' ('Xia nu') Hong Kong/Taiwan (King Hu, 1969)  In this spiritual kung fu movie, a young artist finds himself caught up in the struggle to help a beautiful young woman escape the Imperial agents who murdered her family. A classic of the martial arts fantasy genre, it was the first Chinese film to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival. It was also a massive influence on Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" 'Ikiru' Japan (Akira Kurosawa, 1952)  In this profoundly moralistic fable, longtime salaryman Kanji Watanabe, learns he has terminal cancer and, ultimately, through the experiences he has, the meaning of life. Takashi Shimura  who played Watanabe was nominated in the Best Foreign Actor category at the 1960 BAFTA Awards. 'Utu' New Zealand (Geoff Murphy, 1983)  Loosely based on the events of Te Kooti's War in the 1870s, it tells the tale of Maori tribesman Te Wheke who is serving in the British army. He is prompted to seek vengeance when he returns home to find his village and family destroyed in a senseless raid by the British. 'Gabbeh' Iran (Mohsen Makhmalbaf, 1996)  An elderly nomad couple are cleaning their beautiful carpet or ""gabbeh"" when a young woman suddenly emerges to tell the history of her clan through the carpet. Beautifully filmed and the winner of numerous awards.","""The Screening Room"" has compiled a provisional list of the best Asian films .

"(CNN) -- So goodbye. Nobody wanted it to end this way -- the embarrassment and humbling of a side which has brought so much joy to the world. ""You cannot consider that this generation is finished,"" said Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso ahead of its crunch game against Chile. ""On the contrary, we are still alive."" But Alonso's words rang hollow Wednesday as Spain sank to a 2-0 defeat by Chile at the Maracana -- almost as if this generation has now received the last rites. Dumped out of the World Cup after just two group games on the same day that King Juan Carlos abdicated his throne and signed it over to Prince Felipe, the nation's footballers have now relinquished the crown they once wore with distinction. Those fortunate enough to have a ticket for the potential dethroning came wearing red -- Chilean red. Even before kickoff, there was a sense of something special -- a wind of change, a new era about to be ushered in. This was a moment nobody wanted to miss -- including the 85 Chilean fans who were apprehended by military police after trashing the stadium's media center. While the spine tingling a capella version of the Chilean national anthem galvanized those in white with a call to arms, Spain shrunk away almost apologetically. It was left to Eduardo Vargas and Charles Arranguiz to put the final nails in the coffin-- both men scoring in a high-octane first half. There was no fightback -- no last stand, no heroics from Spain. Those who had once thrilled and mesmerized for so long, slowly and silently slipped away into the Rio night. This was not a mere collapse -- this was an implosion of seismic proportions. ""We cannot complain we did not deserve to go out, they were better than us,"" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque told Spanish TV. ""The team showed character, we pressed forward but we had little luck in front of goal. ""We were certainly inferior to our rivals here at the finals. It is not the moment to think about the future. Little by little we will make the necessary assessments."" Spain had left Salvador last Friday, beaten, thrashed and humiliated after being dismantled with ruthless efficiency by a Dutch side set on revenge following its defeat in final four years ago. It was a defeat which not only brought a shattering halt to the domination it had enjoyed on the international stage -- it was a defeat which signaled the end of an era. For the past six years, this Spanish side has thrilled those who marveled at its tiki-taka passing and ability to make the game look so effortless. For so long a perennial failure, its victory at the 2008 European Championship finals ushered in a period of almost flawless football. Victory at the 2010 World Cup was secured courtesy of a win over the Netherlands, while it retained its European crown comfortably two years later. But the signs of weakness have been growing ever since it was swept aside in last year's Confederations Cup in Brazil. The 3-0 defeat by the host nation in the final shocked not only seasoned observers but also those who had believed Spain's domination would surely continue. A year on, and the weaknesses which were so ruthlessly exposed were laid bare for all to see. After the 5-1 defeat by the Dutch, the Spanish players spoke of how this current generation were not yet finished. Cesc Fabregas, the Chelsea midfielder, philosophized over how this occasion would mean ""life or death"" for his side. But while coach del Bosque would have hoped to revitalize his team by resuscitating his ailing players, Chile arrived hoping to inflict the mortal wound. Where Chile appeared hungry and sprightly, Spain looked slow, cumbersome and leaden footed. The removal of Xavi, for so long the dominant force of the Spanish midfield, already hinted at the start of something drastic. Gone too was Gerard Pique, the Barcelona defender, who endured a difficult time against the Dutch -- not that he was alone. While 11 men in red Spanish shirts made the short walk onto the Maracana field, their minds appeared to be clouded, fuzzy, full of the doubt. No more so than goalkeeper Iker Casillas -- the captain, the man who despite having not featured regularly for club side Real Madrid kept his place in the team. A dismal showing in the previous game had led to calls for him to be replaced -- but on form or not, there was nothing he could do about Chile's opening goal. Jorge Sampaoli's side, playing with a joyful and often naive innocence, roared into action with a thrust which would not look out of place on the dancefloor of a club in Santiago. With 20 minutes played, Chile's ability to combine pace and intricacy cut through the Spanish defense and Vargas rounded off a wonderful flowing move. The goal came with a sense of inevitability -- Chile, roared on by the majority of the stadium, were rampant. Where Spain faltered, Chile stood strong. Where Spain was wasteful, Chile cradled possession like a mother holds its small child. Where Spain sporadically threatened, Chile moved to strike down each and every attack. For a World Cup champion to exit the tournament at the group stage is not unheard of -- France were embarrassed in 2002 and Italy barely competed four years ago as it exited with a whimper. But neither of those teams managed to dominate like this Spanish side. Perhaps had Spain managed to arrive at the interval just one goal behind it may have been different -- but what transpired was nothing short of disastrous. With three minutes of the half remaining, the much maligned Casillas, the man who lifted the trophy four years ago, all but relinquished his and Spain's grip on the crown. Alexis Sanchez's 20-yard free kick appeared simple enough to save but Casillas contrived to punch the ball straight into the path of Aranguiz, who fired home from close range. That self-inflicted wound proved fatal -- Spain never recovered. It tried to fight back, Sergio Busquets missed a great opportunity from five-yards and striker Diego Costa, one of the biggest disappointments of the tournaments, also went close. But it was more in hope than expectation. Each and every time Chile moved forward, Spain fell away seemingly unable to cope with the pace of its opponents. Mauricio Isla should have rubbed salt in Spanish wounds with 20 minutes remaining only to send his effort wide of the post with the goal gaping. Del Bosque even sent on Koke as substitute -- a man whose surname is ResurrecciÃ³n. Not that it mattered -- the curtain had already been brought down, the mourners had left -- the cortege was already on its way. Cameroon 0-4 Croatia . Cameroon suffered a nightmare evening in Manaus as it exited the World Cup with a whimper. Two goals from Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic ensured Croatia won at a canter after Alex Song was sent off for Cameroon. Ivica Olic gave Croatia the perfect start, turning home from close range after 11 minutes. Cameroon was reduced to 10 men when Song inexplicably elbowed Mandzukic -- and Ivan Perisic added a second eight minutes later. Mandzukic headed home a third just after the hour mark before clinching his second of the evening to seal the rout. The result leaves Croatia needing to defeat Mexico in its final Group A game to qualify for the last 16. Cameroon will finish its campaign against host nation Brazil on Monday.","World champion Spain is out of the tournament .

"(RollingStone.com ) -- It's been five years since Prince put out a new record in the United States, since he limited the release of his 20Ten LP, but that will change this fall. On September 30th, the artist will release two new records: Plectrumelectrum, his long-teased album with the group 3rdEyeGirl, and his recently announced solo LP, Art Official Age. He will reportedly hold a series of special events and live dates around the world, details for which are forthcoming, to celebrate the albums' release. Both records are available separately as pre-orders, via the website ArtOfficialAge.com, and include ""instant gratification"" downloads. Art Official Age is being billed as ""classic Prince,"" since it was produced, arranged, composed and performed by the musician (alongside singer-songwriter Joshua Welton). The record reportedly contains a mix of soul, R&B and funk. The pre-order includes the songs ""Breakdown"" and ""Clouds,"" as well as three digital singles. The funky, jazzy latter track is now streaming at Complex. RS: Prince's 15 best post-eighties deep cuts . Prince has already released the video for album track ""Breakfast Can Wait"" and he played ""Funknroll"" during his appearance on Arsenio earlier this year, though the version on Art Official Age is ""funkier and nastier,"" according to a Minneapolis Star Tribune writer who got an early listen. The reporter also claimed that ""This Could Be Us"" was a ballad inspired by Prince's Purple Rain costar Apollonia Kotero and that ""The Gold Standard"" had lyrics ""wild and rude."" The writer also said the album contained an ""aggressive and menacing"" rap song featuring Rita Ora. Plectrumelectrum, a ""classic band album"" that is said to be an ""electrifying funk-rock statement,"" features the singer leading the all-female group ThirdEyeGirl. The ensemble test-drove a number of the record's songs on their recent Hit and Run tours. ""No one can play like this band,"" Prince told Rolling Stone about the record. ""People are going to try, but they won't be able to."" RS: Zooey Deschanel talks Prince collaboration . He also previewed the record at a late-night listening session in New York City, which revealed the hard-rock guitar number (and pre-order instant-gratification track) ""Pretzelbodylogic,"" as well as the original version of ""Funknroll."" Notably absent from the record is Prince's duet with Zooey Deschanel, ""Fallinlove2night,"" which got its debut on The New Girl in March. The records mark Prince's return to Warner Bros., the label he split from acrimoniously in the Nineties after wearing the word ""slave"" on his face as a protest to his record contract. ""When you stop a man from dreaming, he becomes a slave,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1996. ""That's where I was. I don't own Prince's music. If you don't own your masters, your master owns you."" Earlier this year, Prince worked out a deal with the label where he now owns the masters to his recordings. The label previously announced a plan to put out a deluxe, digitally remastered, 30th anniversary release of the Purple Rain soundtrack, though it has yet to announce a release date. RS: Prince on Label Heads: 'They're Always at the Beach With Their Kids' ""Prince is one of just a handful of visionary artists who have truly reshaped and redefined modern music and culture,"" Warner Bros. Chairman & CEO Cameron Strang said in a statement about the two new records. ""For the past 35 years, he has never stopped evolving, challenging himself, reinventing his sound and pushing boundaries. In true Prince fashion, he has just given us not one, but two extraordinary albums that express the incredible range and depth of his talent.

"(CNN) -- Long overdue or not long enough? Lawmakers are beginning to weigh in on the news of Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation, which the former Justice Department prosecutor is expected to announce Thursday afternoon. Holder will resign after leading the Justice Department for over five years. He is one of only three remaining officials originally elected to President Barack Obama's cabinet in 2009. Who might replace Eric Holder? As the first African-American person to hold the position of Attorney General, Holder's legacy will be defined largely by his actions taken in cases involving civil rights, including suing to overturn state voting rights decisions in Texas and North Carolina, working to reduce prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, challenging Arizona's controversial immigration law in 2010, expanding federal recognition of same-sex marriage, and most recently, launching a federal investigation into the death of a young black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. But despite actions that some consider to be major milestones, Holder's legacy is also considered one of the most divisive in history. Here's a roundup of Twitter reaction from Congress. .","Eric Holder is considered the most divisive attorney general in history.

"(CNN) -- Day six of the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows and the shocks just keep on coming in the women's draw. Reigning Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is the latest casualty after crashing out in the third round to Aleksandra Krunic, a player ranked 145 in the world. The Serbian qualifier made light work of the heavy-hitting opponent from the Czech Republic winning in straight sets 6-4 6-4 in one hour 34 minutes. To say that Kvitova was off her game is an understatement as she lost serve five times and racked up 34 unforced errors. But rather than focus on the shortcomings in her own game on Saturday, Kvitova chose to praise her opponent. ""I think she played really unbelievable tennis, and she put a lot of balls back,"" Kvitova said. ""I did mistakes, and I was really trying everything that I could in that moment. I was trying to fight and fighting every point, but it was so difficult. It wasn't really my day. She played really great tennis today."" By her standards, Kvitova has a poor record at the U.S. Open having never got further than the fourth round. But the 24-year-old had reason to hope that this year might be different after claiming a second Wimbledon title in July and her win at the New Haven tournament last week. But her dreams have been extinguished for another 12 months as she becomes the fifth top 10 seed to depart the women's tournament. Kvitova joins second seed Simona Halep, fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, sixth seed Angelique Kerber and Ana Ivanovic, the eight seed -- all of whom have already packed their bags. For Krunic, who will now play Belarusian Victoria Azarenka in the fourth round, it was a victory to savor. ""It was an honor for me to be in the same court with Petra. Of course, I didn't expect to win. Of course, I was hoping at least to win a set, but I managed to win a match somehow."" Azarenka, seeded 16 at Flushing Meadows this year, eased through to the last 16 with a 6-1 6-1 win over Russia's Elena Vesnina. Reigning champion Serena Williams is also safely through to the second week following a 6-3 6-3 win over Varvara Lepchenko while 11th-seed Flavia Pennetta from Italy will face Australia's Casey Dellacqua for a place in the quarterfinals. Pennetta saw off Nicole Gibbs of the U.S. in straight sets 6-4 6-0, while Dellacqua, the 29th seed, needed three sets to get past Karolina Pliskova, winning 6-3 3-6 6-4 in one hour 54 minutes.

"(CNN) -- You might have heard: Brad and Angelina secretly tied the knot at last. A spokesperson for the couple announced that the pair wed privately in a nondenominational civil ceremony in France over the weekend. So ends years of speculation as to when, if ever, one of Hollywood's more famously liberal couples will finally make it official. It's official. The first question, of course: Why now? With the recent, public undoing of some long-term celebrity marriages—Melanie Griffiths and Antonio Banderas, Neil and Pegi Young—it's tempting to wonder why another celebrity couple would even bother. Pitt and Jolie have sustained a seemingly successful relationship (and built a rather large family) without marriage, and the pair is famously liberal besides—the sort of people you might assume are among those a recent Pew Research Center survey found to increasingly consider marriage passé. Conformist. On the road to obsolete. But while marriage in the United States is indeed at a record low, there are still considerable benefits to getting hitched. Marriage confers many financial rights: Federal provisions provide benefits and protections exclusively to married couples, as they also do to small businesses, homeowners and the unemployed. That's one reason millions of gay Americans, and their friends and supporters, continue to fight for the right to marry traditionally. It also comes with emotional, psychological and intellectual benefits. According to studies cited by the National Marriage Project, people in happy marriages are healthier, have more and better sex, and are richer than their unmarried counterparts -- not that it matters to Brad and Angie. Research also shows that the more education and financial independence a woman has, the more likely she is to stay married. But let's not forget that if you are a celebrity, marriage also does a pretty good job of, you guessed it, garnering press. A cynical view, perhaps, but not unwarranted, especially when you consider Brad and Angelina have never exactly shied away from using their relationship and their children as story hooks. It's hard not to wonder if the announcement of the marriage had anything to do with his upcoming film, ""Fury,"" set for release in October, or hers, ""Unbroken,"" which she directed, due out Christmas Day. Meanwhile, this summer the two began filming ""By the Sea,"" their first film as co-stars since ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" the movie that sparked their romance. At the very least, the many, many reports on their marriage will surely mention these projects, as -- oh, look -- I've just gone and done. Brad and Angelina's decision to marry after a decade and six children seems like an incredibly informed one that reflects recent research from the National Marriage Project, which finds couples who make intentional decisions regarding ""major relationship transitions,"" rather than just letting things happen because it's the next logical step, are more likely to have successful marriages. And indeed, their union is representative of the rising rates of cohabitation before marriage, which gives people more time to make sure theirs is a good choice. So maybe that's it. Maybe these two waited so long precisely because they don't take marriage (his second, her third) lightly. Getting more moviegoers in seats as a result? Well, that's just the icing on the proverbial wedding cake.","Peggy Drexler: Angelina and Brad seemed to be doing just fine without tying knot .

"New York (CNN) -- Police arrested a Columbia University professor accused of having a three-year long sexual relationship with his daughter, officials said. David Epstein is charged with one count of incest in the third degree, according to a statement from the Manhattan District Attorney's office. The alleged sexual relationship between Epstein and his biological daughter -- now 24 years-old -- took place between 2006 and 2009, the statement said. He could face four years in prison, if convicted. His attorney Matthew Galluzzo said Epstein is innocent, claiming the charges are ""unfair and unwarranted."" ""He is a respected member of the academic community and wishes to thank his friends at Columbia University for their continued support throughout this ordeal,"" Galluzzo said. Columbia University placed the 46-year old professor of political science on administrative leave, but declined further comment regarding the investigation, said university spokesman Robert Hornsby.

"(CNN) -- The film ""Blue Is the Warmest Color,"" a French import, has kicked up a storm of controversy, mostly because of its extraordinarily long, detailed and explicit lesbian sexual and romantic scenes. So graphic was a roughly six-minute coupling, that the Motion Picture Association of America gave the movie an NC-17 rating, that is, no one under 17 admitted. But there was additional controversy when a prominent film critic suggested it could be a good movie to introduce one's teenage daughter to. In a blog post on The New York Times website about a theater in New York that chose to flout the MPAA rating, critic A.O. Scott said that ""in some ways, because of its tone and subject matter, 'Blue' is a movie that may be best appreciated by viewers under the NC-17 age cutoff."" His 14-year-old daughter had seen it twice at the Telluride Film Festival. My take on his comment -- as a sex researcher, a university professor and a mom who has seen the film -- is: ""Are you kidding?!"" I would not recommend anything so vivid portrayed by a same-sex or opposite sex couple to any young person, particularly one who was not already sexually experienced. Furthermore, while my family is hardly shy about sharing information and opinions on all kinds of sex, it would be awkward and inappropriate to be the one introducing either my daughter or son to three highly-detailed sex scenes (even simulated, which these are). We may have frank conversations about sex, but they're not fully illustrated, and that makes a difference! If you have not yet sat down with your kids to look through pictures of sexual positions and intercourse, having them watch this movie would be a strange place to start. ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" is not family entertainment. Its athletic, rough and tumble sexuality can look aggressive, even frightening, to an inexperienced young person, and it is hard to explain to many teens why that might also be loving. In a perfect world, one would want one's child to go through stages of experiencing sex, from kissing to fondling to an intimate connection with a first lover. Perhaps this is idealistic, but at least their exposure to vivid images of sexuality might occur over time, graduated according to what they are ready to see and understand. In any case, it's certainly not something they'd want to watch with their parents, although it's not clear whether Scott actually accompanied his 14-year-old to the Telluride screenings. I am also mystified that Scott talks about the movie as a realistic depiction of young love that teens will identify with. Huh? This is not a realistic depiction for most teenagers. Approximately 40% to 50% of them will not have had intercourse until they have graduated high school. Very few of them will have had a relationship of this caliber or impact. How sexually explicit films affect kids is debated among health professionals and sex researchers. Some maintain that they can encourage sexual experimentation and a change in values in young people, while others disagree -- but as a parent, why go there? Why consciously risk flipping youngsters ahead of their own experience by introducing information before they are more erotically mature? One other reservation about taking a teen to this movie? I love a love story; gay, straight, bisexual or undecided. The chilling part of this film is that it's basically the story of an adult woman (she's 5 or 6 years older) poaching on a high-schooler. The issue is glossed over in the movie. But parents should be wary of taking their kids to see a movie that glamorizes sexual relationships between a sexy older person and a teen. Yes, it's only a movie. But it is one that can deliver a message. Of course, there should be lots of conversations between parent and child on all these topics -- lesbian love affairs, affairs with older lovers, sexual desire when you are young -- before a child is launched into the adult world. But a parent exposing a child to deeply intimate sexuality -- people having oral sex together, slapping and grabbing each others' butts and bringing each other to orgasm -- is neither necessary nor desirable. We can have, as sex educators call it, ""a teachable moment"" other ways. If your child does go see this film, by all means, discuss it. But I am pretty sure this kind of field trip would make parent and child feel they'd had an exceptionally squeamish, and highly regrettable, experience. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Pepper Schwartz: Graphic sex in ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" causing controversy .

"(CNN) -- Tony Stewart says he took the last three weekends off to respect the family of the driver that his race car struck and killed this month, and to deal with his own emotions. Returning to NASCAR racing this weekend, he says, will help him cope. Stewart, who opted out of three races after his car hit Kevin Ward Jr. during a dirt track race on August 9, spoke briefly to reporters Friday about his decision to race in Sunday's Oral-B USA 500 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway. ""This has been one of the toughest tragedies I've ever had to deal with, both professionally and personally. And this is something that will definitely affect my life forever,"" Stewart said at the speedway in his first public appearance since Ward's death. While the incident hit him hard, Stewart said he knows ""that the pain and the mourning that Kevin Ward's family and friends are experiencing is something that I can't possibly imagine."" ""(The time off) has given me the time to think about life and how easy it is to take it for granted,"" Stewart said. ""I miss my team, my teammates, and I miss being back in the race car. I think that being back in the car this week with my racing family will help me get through this difficult time."" He declined to take reporters' questions, saying he needed to respect the investigation into Ward's death. New York authorities continue to investigate the incident, which happened after Ward crashed and then exited his race car during an Empire Super Sprints series race in New York. Spectator video from that night at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park race shows two cars coming out of a turn, with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Ward gets out of his crashed car and walks determinedly on the track toward the race cars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. Authorities said that the 20-year-old Ward, a New York sprint car driver, died of ""massive blunt trauma."" Stewart withdrew from the NASCAR race in New York's Watkins Glen the day after Ward died. He also missed races in Michigan and Tennessee. Ontario County Sheriff Philip C. Povero said at the time that there was no evidence that a crime had been committed. Stewart said that he wants Ward's parents and sisters ""to know that every day I'm thinking about them and praying for them."" Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. He began racing when he was 4, running go-kart events. When he was 12, he moved to the faster sprint cars. His father blames Stewart for hitting his son. ""Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,"" the father said, according to Syracuse.com. Brett Frood, executive vice president of Stewart's racing team, Stewart-Hass, said Friday that Stewart sent the Ward family flowers and a card, and that eventually he will want to spend time with them . ""I do believe that will happen at the appropriate time,"" Frood said. Meanwhile, Stewart will be eligible for this year's ""Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup"" playoff system if he wins either in Atlanta or next week in Richmond -- the last two races of the regular season -- NASCAR President Mike Helton said. There had been speculation that Stewart would have been ineligible because he missed the last three races. NASCAR had said previously that to qualify, a driver must attempt to qualify for all 26 races leading up to the Chase. But Helton said Friday that NASCAR was waiving that requirement because of the ""unique set of circumstances"" in this case. CNN's Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.","Racer was driving in a dirt-track race when he hit a competitor who was walking .

"(CNN) -- Five people suffered minor injuries Friday when a duck boat crashed into several other vehicles in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The chain-reaction crash happened shortly after noon on a ramp from Embankment Road West to Charles Street Circle, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Thomas Murphy said. At least seven vehicles were involved. No one was seriously hurt. Cindy Brown, general manager of Boston Duck Tours, said a piece of fallen equipment caused the crash. ""A computer box fell off and become lodged under the brake"" pedal, Brown said. Once the driver dislodged the box, Brown said, the duck boat was able to brake normally. Brown estimated that the duck boat was traveling between 15 and 20 mph when it crashed. ""We're re-inspecting the vehicles that are of the same configuration,"" Brown said. Duck boats are amphibious vehicles often used for tours on land or water. Two people were killed this month when a barge hit a duck boat on the Delaware River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

"(CNN) -- I recently interviewed more than 60 chief executives of very large global companies. Virtually all of them said that recruiting and promoting general managers with true leadership potential was the key ingredient to their organization's long-term success. Fair enough. But the CEOs were then quick to admit that this task is much easier said than done. Time and again, externally recruited ""stars,"" as well as freshly promoted general managers from within their companies' ranks, failed to live up to lofty expectations. This leads to an important question: Why are we bad at picking good leaders? The short answer is, we focus on all the wrong things, like a candidate's charm, their stellar résumé or their academic credentials. None of this has any bearing on leadership potential. And despite claims to the contrary, even a candidate's past results have little bearing on whether the promoted individual will succeed once promoted. Want to be a leader? Act like one . At best, a ""track record"" tells only half of the story. In a new position, the candidate will have to face new obstacles, deal with a new team, manage more people introduce new products and do it all without a clear road map. So what qualities should you focus on before handing out the next big promotion or making big promotion decision? One thing is certain: You better get it right. Nothing short of your reputation, and your organization's success, are at stake. Let's cut to the chase. There are seven fundamental leadership qualities that the candidate must possess to be effective. Take just one of these away, and sooner or later, the newly elevated manager will fail. Having studied the careers of nearly 1,000 executives, over the past decade, it is clear to me that failure results when a leader lacks of one or more of these seven attributes. Integrity . It all starts with integrity. Like a foundation for any well-constructed house, integrity is the core foundation for leadership effectiveness. It is a blend of honesty, consistency and ethics. Once integrity is squandered or even thrown into doubt, it is very hard for a leader to regain the trust of his or her troops. Passion . Yet integrity alone doesn't matter without several other key attributes. Passion, for example, enables a leader to keep moving forward even in tough times. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, was ridiculed in 2001 for clinging to a company that many called ""Amazon.bomb."" It is now valued at $89 billion. Bezos told me that it was his inner passion that fueled his drive to keep pushing forward even in the darkest days of the dot-com crash, when the company was teetering on the brink of collapse. Courage . Courage, another make-it-or-break-it quality, is necessary to make the difficult decisions when facing conflicts and mediating adversity. Courage springs from a leader's core values and commitment to a vision. Vision . Without a compelling vision or destination, how can a boss effectively persuade people to embark upon a new direction? Visionary leaders inspire employees to imagine a better future and work hard to achieve it. Steve Jobs: How to lead with purpose . Judgment . Actually achieving this vision, however, requires judgment. Good judgment allows the leader to make solid business decisions and choices. When I assess an aspiring leader, I want to see whether she can confront a complex new challenge and quickly zero in on the most important issues. Does she ask good questions? Can she prioritize and make difficult tradeoffs? Does she know where to focus and where not to waste her time and energy? Even when looking at an individual piece of the problem, does she keep the entire chessboard in mind, recognizing the potential unintended consequences of her decisions? Judgment is needed to develop a strategy that will enable the organization to achieve its vision. Empathy . No matter the organization, diversity of its people is the one constant. Each team member has a different personality, motivation and underlying agenda. Empathy is the attribute that allows a leader to effectively understand what makes other people tick. Identifying the fundamental drivers of their bosses, peers and subordinates is critical. Same goes for getting people aligned and motivated around their common goals. Outside your specific organization, it is invaluable that a leader be able to quickly and accurately figure out why an important customer seems dissatisfied, even though they say everything is fine. If a potential employee doesn't have empathy, they have very little chance of getting these, and many other, important constituents on their side. Lack of empathy is a key reason why otherwise analytically brilliant leaders often come up short. Emotional intelligence . While empathy is externally focused, another key leadership attribute, emotional intelligence, is internally focused. An emotionally intelligent leader habitually takes a hard, honest look at himself and accurately discerns his strengths, weaknesses and blind spots. Putting personal pride aside, he actively solicits the input of others and incorporates the team's best ideas into the overall action plan. Without emotional intelligence, hubris sets in, and a leader will overestimate his own ability and alienate others. Even though the hubris may convince him that he can bite off more than he can chew, subordinates will not be so blind. A leader who continuously lets down his or her team won't stay in the organization's good graces for long. From my vantage point, a lack of emotional intelligence is probably the top derailer of previously successful managers moving into fundamentally new and ambiguous roles. These seven leadership attributes -- integrity, vision, judgment, passion, courage, empathy and emotional intelligence -- are all the hallmarks of great leaders, regardless of industry or geography. By gearing any candidate assessment towards these traits -- and away from false predictors of success, like a sparkling personality, a polished résumé or good interview skills -- you will be one big step ahead of the rest of the crowd who are still scratching their heads wondering why they are so bad at picking good leaders. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Cohn.","Business leaders often picked based on charm or academic credentials, says Jeffrey Cohn .

"(CNN) -- With its luminous body seemingly hovering above the water, and five spidery legs plunging deep into the sea, this futuristic building could be the mothership in a sci-fi film. In fact, it's the design for one of the world's largest underwater hotels -- and it could be coming to a beach near you. Introducing the Water Discus Hotel, a luxury multi-million dollar resort featuring 21 moveable rooms found in the heart of spectacular coral reefs. Maldives to Dubai . The space-age hotel is now set to be built on the remote -- and postcard perfect -- tropical island of Kuredhivaru in the Maldive Islands, with the National Ministry of Tourism giving the go-ahead to the ambitious plan last week. The United Arab Emirates may soon be the next home of the high-tech hotel, with a Dubai construction company also in negotiations to build the surreal structure. ""There are many people who will never have the courage to dive to these beautiful reefs,"" designer, Pawel Podwojewski, told CNN. ""But here you will have the chance to explore an underwater world from the comfort of your bedroom."" Space-age seascape . Described as ""Star Trek meets the undersea world of Jacques Cousteau,"" the remarkable building -- valued at up to $50 million -- is the brainchild of Polish company Deep Ocean Technology, backed by Swiss investors. The luminous hotel features two large disc-shaped lounges seven-meters above the water, housing a luxury restaurant and spa. The lounges are connected to a glass tunnel plunging 30-meters below the water, leading to 21 opulent bedrooms. ""A lot of people have said it looks like something from a James Bond film,"" said Podwojewski. ""I'm a big fan of the movies, so perhaps that was an inspiration."" ""I wanted to keep it as sleek and simple as possible -- so the sphere shape is very efficient."" Deep end . The cutting-edge hotel may plunge deep beneath the ocean, but its luxury facilities are sky-high, including a helicopter landing pad and rooftop swimming pool. Guests can sit back and enjoy views of vibrant reefs and tropical fish, all from the comfort of their bed. Those wanting to explore the spectacular underwater world, can also dive straight in from the hotel's airlock compartment, including its own decompression chamber. The more adventurous can even take a ride in a three-passenger deep-sea submarine. Moving on up . Not only does the hotel look like a spaceship -- it actually moves like one, with the largest underwater saucer-shaped room able to slide to the surface in emergencies. ""If you need to replace a window for example, it's very difficult underwater,"" explained Podwojewski. ""So we wanted to build a building that can surface any time for maintenance or safety."" ""It's a bit like a balloon underwater -- when we let go of the water from the room's huge tanks, the balloon will surface automatically. It doesn't need to rely on electricity."" Environmental concerns . Developers hope to limit the impact on coral reefs by laying the foundation in as few points as possible. There are also plans to rebuild coral reefs, by growing the vibrant eco-systems in a special plantation before relocating them around the hotel. ""To preserve the natural environment we have developed couple of kinds of foundations depending on the local conditions,"" said Podwojewski. ""The key is to touch the sea ground in just few points."" ""Most probably the hotel will land on a flat sand area to reflect the sun rays inside the rooms and the reef will be additionally planted around the hotel rooms to enrich the view."" The space-age design might seem like something from the future. But it seems this unique underwater hotel will be much closer than you think.","Imagine waking from your hotel bed to a dramatic underwater world .

"(CNN) -- Eli Wallach, whose long acting career included performances in ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" ""The Godfather Part III"" and ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" has died. He was 98. Wallach died Tuesday night. A family member confirmed his death to CNN. Wallach was long one of Hollywood's favorite character actors, giving his parts -- often villains, mobsters or shopkeepers -- an added touch of menace with his gravelly voice. In ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" -- two key '60s Westerns -- he played bandits. He also played opposite some of the biggest stars in history. His more than 150 credits includes roles in ""The Misfits"" (1961), with Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe; ""Lord Jim"" (1965), with Peter O'Toole and James Mason; ""Tough Guys"" (1986), with Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster; ""The Two Jakes"" (1990), with Jack Nicholson; and even a small, uncredited role in ""Mystic River"" (2003), starring Sean Penn and Tim Robbins and directed by Clint Eastwood -- his co-star in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" But Wallach's heart was in live theater, where he originated parts in such works as Tennessee Williams' ""The Rose Tattoo"" and Eugene Ionesco's ""Rhinoceros."" ""For actors, movies are a means to an end,"" Wallach told The New York Times in 1973. ""I go and get on a horse in Spain for 10 weeks, and I have enough cushion to come back and do a play."" Eli Herschel Wallach was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 7, 1915. Though he was Jewish, he grew up in a largely Italian neighborhood, an experience that would later help him in a number of roles. ""I grew up watching Italians. And, in 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,' (director) Sergio Leone said, 'You have to pray in here. Cross yourself. You know how to cross yourself?' I said, 'Well, I'm Jewish, but I learned how to cross myself because the Italians did it every day 30, 40 times a day, crossing themselves,'"" he said in an interview with the blog Old New York Stories. Wallach attended the University of Texas -- among his classmates was Walter Cronkite -- and served in the Army during World War II. After the war, he attended the Actors Studio and became a leading devotee of the Method, the approach to acting that asks performers to draw on their own experiences and emotions for an interior understanding of the part. (Lee Strasberg, perhaps the Method's primary American popularizer, once said, ""Method acting is what all actors have always done whenever they acted well."") He won a Tony for his performance in ""The Rose Tattoo"" and also acted in ""Mister Roberts,"" ""The Teahouse of the August Moon"" and ""Major Barbara."" He made his film debut in another Tennessee Williams work, ""Baby Doll"" (1956), three years after turning down the role of Maggio in ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953). That part went to Frank Sinatra and revitalized his career. ""Every time Sinatra met me after that, he would say to me, 'Hello, you crazy actor,'"" he told Old New York Stories. He almost turned down the part in ""Magnificent Seven,"" but changed his mind when he saw how he could shape the role of the bandit Calvera, he told the website American Legends. ""I went to (director John) Sturges and said, 'In movie Westerns, you never see what the bandits do with the money. ... I want to show how they spend it. I want to have silk shirts. I'm going to put in two gold teeth. I want a good horse, a wonderful saddle.' Sturges said, 'OK. You got it.'"" ""Magnificent Seven"" also starred Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson and featured Elmer Bernstein's stirring score. Of the leading members of the cast, only Robert Vaughn is still alive. Wallach worked steadily, whether on stage, the big screen or small -- especially if the TV series was based in New York. He was in a 1992 episode of ""Law & Order"" and performed in the short-lived ""Tribeca"" and ""100 Centre Street."" But work was work, and that also meant parts in ""ER,"" ""Murder, She Wrote,"" ""Highway to Heaven"" and the TV movie ""The Executioner's Song."" He made ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" (2010) when he was 94. He had a sense of humor about his fame. He titled his memoir ""The Good, the Bad and Me,"" since his role in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" was ""the Ugly"" -- Tuco, the sometimes buffoonish bandit. And he enjoyed the spotlight -- even when he was promoting his book. ""I'm having fun answering questions,"" he said in a publisher's interview. ""A woman asked me, 'Is that your real name?' And I said, 'How do you dream up a name like mine?'"" Wallach is survived by his wife, actress Anne Jackson, to whom he was married for 66 years; three children and many grandchildren.

"(CNN) -- Israel and Hamas agreed to a 12-hour cease-fire starting Saturday morning, temporarily halting more than two weeks of bloodshed that has claimed more than 900 mostly civilian lives. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Secretary of State John Kerry that Israel would agree to the truce, according to a U.S. official traveling with Kerry. And Palestinian parliament member Mustafa Barghouti said Hamas will comply. ""Of course, they will,"" Barghouti told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" Friday. ""Not only Hamas but all Palestinians."" Both Barghouti and the chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said Hamas was willing to sign on to a proposed seven-day cease-fire as well. Kerry said Friday that Netanyahu was willing to go along with a temporary truce ""as a good-faith down payment to move forward."" Early Saturday, Israel Defense Forces warned in a statement that it will respond if militants attack its personnel or fire at Israeli civilians during the cease-fire that began at 8 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) Saturday. . During the cease-fire, the IDF will continue to carry out operations to ""locate and neutralize"" tunnels in Gaza, the statement said. The Israeli Cabinet had earlier rejected a proposed one-week humanitarian cease-fire, but Kerry said no final proposal was submitted to Israel for a vote. ""Let's make that clear,"" Kerry told reporters in Cairo. ""There is always mischief from people who oppose certain things, and I consider this one of those mischievous things."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joined Kerry in efforts to reach a deal. He called for a 12-hour humanitarian cease-fire, with the hope that it can be extended to seven days. ""Surely now, the parties must realize it is time for them to act,"" Ban said. ""My hope is that the 12 hours will be extended, perhaps to 24, and people will draw from that the good will and effort to find a solution,"" said Kerry, adding that he will travel to Paris on Saturday and continue to push for a deal. The United States and Egypt were thought Friday to be moving closer to an agreement with Israel and the Palestinians on a one-week truce, starting Sunday. Kerry met in Egypt with Ban and Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri. Fresh West Bank clashes break out as Israel girds for 'day of rage' The Americans are taking the lead on drafting the text in consultation with Egyptians, the sources said. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is the main Palestinian party to the agreement and has been the lead in discussions with the United States, Egypt and Israel. How do we get a cease-fire to end the bloodshed in Gaza? Qatar is the main conduit for talks with Hamas, along with Turkey, and sources said the United States is working with those two countries to try and get Hamas to sign on. Key details of the plan are still under negotiation, the sources said, including an Israeli proposal for its troops to remain in Gaza during the one-week truce. The temporary humanitarian cease-fire would be used to get medical supplies into Gaza, and the injured and some of the bodies out. If that can be achieved, the parties hope they can enter formal negotiations on a more permanent truce that addresses economic, political and security concerns about Gaza, with other nations involved.

"(CNN) -- In an age where planes travel at record speeds and Google Earth gives visuals of every nook and cranny in the Grand Canyon, it may seem like the spirit of adventure and exploration that characterized the Wild West has gone the way of the T-Rex. But along the Apache Trail outside of Phoenix, that spirit remains afire, accessible to anyone with a car and the heart of a cowboy. The Apache Trail is a 40-mile circular road winding through the Superstition Mountains. Originally used as a migration route by the Apache Indians, it eventually became a stagecoach route and now a scenic drive. Although scenic may be too tame a description. Known for being one of the most treacherous routes in the United States, the road curves through steep mountainous terrain, surrounded by bush and cacti and a limited number of gas stations. Adding to the treachery, a segment of the trail remains unpaved between Tortilla Flat and Roosevelt Dam. This patch of narrow road slithers through some of the most spectacular scenery on the trail, but can be dangerous and is not recommended for large vehicles, including RVs, caravans, and some SUVs. (If renting a vehicle, check that the company allows your particular car to travel down this portion of the trail.) Paved or unpaved, a trip along the trail is a worthwhile expedition for anyone wanting a Wild West adventure in the 21st century. Check out these must-see stops: . Lost Dutchman State Park . Visitors at the first stop along the Apache Trail might expect to meet Annie Oakley or Jesse James ambling with guns in their hip holsters through cacti and inhaling the Arizona dry air. But it's Jacob Waltz whose name is famous here. Known as the Lost Dutchman -- though historical records indicate he hailed from Germany -- Waltz claimed to find a gold mine hidden in the Superstition Mountains, but he refused to reveal its location and no one has located it since his death in 1891. Today, those in search of a fortune continue to traverse Lost Dutchman State Park in search of the mine. A handful have died in their quest. But for many others, the hiking trails provide an opportunity to explore the unique natural wonders of the Arizona desert. The park maintains hiking trails of varying difficulties as well as camping and RV sites for those wanting to spend the night. Goldfield Ghost Town . Goldfield is a restored ghost town settled by miners a century ago. Tourists can take a tour of the old mine, sift for gold, dine at the saloon -- surrounded by antler and buffalo heads -- or amble down Main Street to LuLu's ""family friendly"" Bordello Museum and Gift Shop. Be sure to sample some of the root beer fudge and prickly pear cactus fudge at the General Store for a soda-shop-meets-Wild-West kind of treat. Gunfights occur hourly on weekends between noon and 4 p.m., and weddings can be held at the town church. Canyon Lake . It's a curious sight to round a bend on the Apache Trail and find a 950-acre lake nestled in the desert valley. That's because Canyon Lake was formed as a result of the Mormon Flat Dam, which was completed in 1925. Today, the lake is a welcome oasis from the oppressive hot and dry air that characterizes the Southwest. Visitors to Canyon Lake may swim, sunbathe on the beach or rent a boat at the Marina. Canyon Lake also has campgrounds, a restaurant, and for a short romantic getaway, the Dolly Steamboat offers both daytime and dinner cruises. Tortilla Flat . This outpost in the Superstition Mountains is home to six fearless residents and the tourists who pass through to see sites like Dutchman's Inn, founded by Jacob Waltz himself when he didn't like the town's restaurants. ""Pardners, you're lookin' at the result,"" a sign outside the site says, ""Jacob even made sure spirits were included since he could not resist a nip or two occasionally."" (Sadly, there's no dining or nipping at the Dutchman's Inn now). It is well worth a visit to the Superstition Saloon, where the wallpaper is composed of paper currency from a variety of countries, sarsaparillas flow freely, and the bar stools are made of horse saddles. A post office is also present so intrepid tourists can drop a postcard purchased from the general store into the mail. (The general store also stocks some particularly colorful and sparkly cowboy hats.) Apache Lake . Like Canyon Lake, Apache Lake was formed by a dam erected along the Salt River. Today, the site offers intimate coves, hiking trails, fishing, boating and water skiing opportunities. Those walking around the 17-mile lake shouldn't be surprised to see wildlife including javelinas, deer and eagles. The site also offers a motel, restaurant and gas station. RV and camper hookups are available. Roosevelt Dam and Lake . Like the Hoover Dam, Roosevelt Dam is a concrete arc designed to conserve water in the desert and provide electricity. Approximately 300 feet high, the Dam contains Roosevelt Lake, where tourists can swim, camp, boat, ride personal watercraft and shop at the general store. Tonto National Monument . Visitors who reach the farthest point along the Apache Trail loop from the entrance at Lost Dutchman State Park will be rewarded with the sight of Tonto National Monument. This monument preserves cave dwellings used over 700 years ago by ancient residents in what used to be a bustling community. Spectacular views of Roosevelt Lake are available from the monument. Tonto National Monument also has an 18-minute orientation video in the museum, which can be a welcome retreat if the weather is oppressive. Special activities including moon hikes, and off-site hikes are scheduled at various times of year, so be sure to check the website in advance of visiting. The entire Apache Trail takes about six hours to drive through. For travelers wanting a shorter journey, it takes approximately 90 minutes to drive the loop from Lost Dutchman State Park to Tortilla Flat and back. (The sites are more condensed on this part of the trail and all roads are paved.) But whether taking the long or short route, be sure to start off on the trail with a full tank of gas, refilling whenever possible to avoid running empty on the narrow road.And keep an eye out for the Dutchman's lost mine -- anyone who finds it would surely prove that the age of expedition and adventure on the Apache Trail is far from over.","Arizona's 40-mile Apache Trail captures the flavor of the Old West .

"(Health.com)  -- Lana, a 38 year-old publicist in Los Angeles, California, was diagnosed with genital herpes in 1997. Since then, she has ""kind of been hiding"" from the dating scene. Let's face it: How do you drop that bomb on a potential love interest? And when? She considered a number of online dating venues, but she says Match.com asked too many questions on its enrollment form, eHarmony was too ""religious,"" and MySpace was too much of a ""hookup zone."" ""I wanted to meet men with my same diagnosis so we wouldn't [need to] have 'the talk,' or fear of rejection and transmitting,"" she says. ""Most of us with this don't wish to spread it."" Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the economic downturn, the billion-dollar online dating industry has been booming. But not everyone has felt welcome at the party. While sites like Match.com and eHarmony don't discriminate, they also don't cater to people like Lana who are coping with sexually transmitted diseases, disabilities, or mental health conditions. All of these can make dating -- often an ego-shattering minefield for those in perfect health -- even trickier. ""On bigger dating sites the competition is tremendous,"" says Jim Houran, PhD, a clinical psychologist and columnist for Online Dating Magazine. ""And let's face it, depending on what [the illness] is, it could very well make you uncompetitive in the larger dating pool."" Health.com: 28 days to a healthier relationship . Fortunately, there are a number of alternatives. A new breed of dating sites has emerged to play cupid for people with chronic diseases and disabilities. Over the past five years, several sites -- such as Prescription4love.com, Nolongerlonely.com, and Cisforcupid.com -- have launched to serve the needs of people with conditions ranging from bipolar disorder to Crohn's disease. Together these sites now boast tens of thousands of members. In addition to providing their users with a more hospitable environment, these websites defuse the tension over how and when to disclose an illness, which is often an issue for people with diseases and disabilities who venture onto mainstream dating sites. When health problems equal heartache . After some ""horrible"" results on other dating websites, Lana joined Prescription 4 Love and the STD-specific site Positivesingles.com. Both sites require members to disclose their illnesses upfront, clearing the air for what might be a deal-breaking revelation later. Within her first week on Positive Singles, she went on three dates and has since gone on seven more, which fostered one romantic relationship and a friendship over the past two years. She's even rejected a couple dozen guys. Health.com: How to tell your partner a health secret . ""I don't think I would have been able to have 10 dates without the site,"" says Lana. ""It's easier to get rejected via email, and you can take baby steps online without hunting outside."" Though Prescription 4 Love didn't yield any dates for Lana, this fast-growing online community offers an alternative to mainstream dating sites for thousands of singles. Now three years old, the site currently has 8,000 members who represent nearly 40 health conditions ranging from genital herpes (2,425 members) to Tourette's syndrome (32 members). Ricky Durham founded Prescription 4 Love in 2006, inspired by his late brother Keith, who lived with Crohn's disease for 15 years before passing away in 2004. ""He was a good-looking boy, and he could find dates, but when do you tell someone you have a colostomy bag? The night you go out? Two weeks after you go out?"" Durham asks. ""He was having a hard time with that, so I thought if he could find someone who had the same disease, or someone with a colostomy bag, he wouldn't really have to discuss that."" Since launching the site, Durham, 48, who previously dabbled in the stock market and worked as a bartender, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Though he doesn't find it appropriate to be a member of a community he founded, he says he can empathize with his members. ""It's nice to find someone who's going through what you're going through,"" he says. Love for less . Niche sites are also a lot less expensive. Prescription 4 Love, which started charging in May 2009, is $9.95 per month, while most of the features on No Longer Lonely (including the dating service and chat rooms) are still free. (Access to the site's full features is available for $24 per year. That's substantially cheaper than sites like Match.com and eHarmony, which can cost upwards of $35 per month.) ""To me, that's pressure right there,"" says Robert Watson, the executive director of the nonprofit dating service DateAble.org, which caters primarily to those with physical and mild psychiatric handicaps. ""If it's the 30th day of the month, you're thinking, 'I've got one more day to find someone or it's another $35.'"" DateAble, which was founded in 1987 by a Washington, D.C., doctor who wanted to give her patients a way to combat the isolation that accompanied their physical disabilities, charges a $125 initiation fee for the first year and $25 every year thereafter. For that fee, members get a more personalized experience, as DateAble is more akin to an old-school matchmaking service. The organization has been responsible for almost 1,000 marriages, according to Watson. As one of its first members, he should know: He met his wife, Lynn, at a DateAble Valentine's Day party in 1988. ""I didn't want to try it,"" says Watson, who has moderate cerebral palsy and was working as a national project director for the United Cerebral Palsy Association at the time. ""But I probably knew everybody in my community and nobody I knew wanted to date me or vice versa. Lynn lived 60 miles away, but we made it work."" By pushing a ""friends first"" concept, which has been emulated in the communal blog and forum features of Prescription 4 Love, No Longer Lonely, and other illness-specific sites, DateAble members can get up to speed on the dating world in a familiar environment without the prying eyes of the Web. ""People with disabilities, especially developmental disabilities, are typically behind the eight ball because they haven't had the practice of dating in college or their young adult life,"" says Watson. ""Many of them never had the puppy love, been broken up with, experienced the fights, or the good stuff."" To make up for this lost time, his best bit of advice is to be totally honest. Even in our post-Americans With Disabilities Act society, notes Watson, failing to mention that you're confined to a wheelchair or dealing with another type of handicap might bring a first date to an abrupt end after a courtesy ""I'm sorry"" drink. The stigma of mental illness . People with physical disabilities aren't the only ones who face stigma while dating. People with mental health problems, from chronic depression to schizophrenia, have also benefited from specialized sites. Jim Leftwich, 39, a college librarian from White Plains, New York, has lived with schizoaffective disorder, a condition that combines features of schizophrenia and mood disorders (such as depression), since 1992. In 2004, after years of brushing up against the harsh realities of the dating scene, Leftwich founded No Longer Lonely, a dating site that caters to the mentally ill. ""I thought to myself, 'There should be something like this out there,' and I was surprised to find there wasn't,"" says Leftwich. ""If you're mentally ill, it's kind of a hostile world out there. I thought by taking down that whole bugaboo of having an illness, making it all open with everyone knowing, it would facilitate things. People would be more trusting and relationships might be more successful."" No Longer Lonely now has 16,000 members and a brand new interface (similar to those of social-networking sites) that allows users to upload poems, art, videos, and blogs. The site has been responsible for more than 20 marriages. ""I find with my clientele, they're more willing to get to know someone remotely and they're more open,"" he says. ""They don't have the same kind of prejudices that people in general tend to have."" Even though most mental illnesses can be controlled with medication, therapy, or a combination of the two, some people still view conditions such as bipolar disorder as a mark of weakness or instability. ""Even in today's enlightened society, where acceptance and diversity are hailed as the right thing to do...mentally ill people tend to be outcasts. It's terrible,"" says Houran, who is also a former instructor of clinical psychiatry at the Southern Illinois School of Medicine. ""The minute someone knows you have a certain mental disorder, they assume it means that you're not capable of love, or that you're dangerous or unstable. Those are myths. Given the right care, people with mental illnesses and other medical conditions can lead very normal, functioning lives."" Some mental illnesses -- certain mood or personality disorders, for instance -- could cause problems in fledgling relationships, Houran acknowledges. And especially if the relationship progresses to thoughts of marriage and kids, two partners who each have bipolar disorder, for example, could find themselves debating whether it's safe or wise to have children. However, says Houran, in most cases these considerations aren't enough to forestall a relationship. ""Even under the best of circumstances, people still have major relationship challenges,"" he says. For Houran, this outgrowth of illness-specific dating sites and services is a boon. ""Niche sites are growing in popularity because they allow people with these very specific needs or interests to connect in a way that's not possible on the big dating sites,"" he says. ""The big dating sites are akin to Wal-Mart. You have a lot of quantity, but that doesn't mean you're going to find people with a lot quality in the way you define it. That being said, niche sites by their very construction tend to be very small. So I always advocate [that] people use both.""

"(CNN) -- Well, look at that. The boys at Augusta National Golf Club finally came into the 20th century, only 12 years after the millennium. With the admission of Condoleezza Rice and businesswoman Darla Moore into their previously male-only club, one more gender barrier has been cracked. But it remains to be seen whether it has been truly broken. Augusta National was forced to open to black men way back in 1990, when a controversy erupted at the Shoal Creek Country Club in Alabama. The club was all white, and PGA tour sponsors balked. So the PGA changed the rules -- meaning clubs that discriminated on the basis of race or gender would no longer be allowed to host a tournament. Some -- like Shoal Creek -- changed their policies and opened the membership. Others said ""no thanks,"" valuing their right to discriminate above hosting a tournament. But there was one exception -- Augusta National. It did open to black men ""after being pistol-whipped behind closed doors,"" according to one major golf writer who was around at the time. But it drew the line on the girls. That's why the Masters Golf Tournament hasn't been an ""official"" PGA tour event since then, even though the results count, and everybody knows the PGA is officially ignoring its own policies and looking the other way. When the National Council of Women's Organizations asked the club in a polite letter in 2002 to reconsider its stand against women, then-Chairman Hootie Johnson went ballistic. It became a national argument over where women ought to be allowed to go, and who had the right to openly and proudly discriminate. And when NCWO made the membership roster public for the first time since the club was formed, it became clear that while race discrimination was viewed by the Fortune 500 CEOs who made up the membership as a no-no, they saw nothing wrong with sex discrimination. They cowered behind their mahogany desks and refused to make a statement -- never mind resign from the club. IBM, the major sponsor of the Masters, even had a representative call me as chairwoman of NCWO and bawl me out for making a fuss. Celebration, surprise, humor after Augusta National admits first women . Confined to a muddy field far from the gates, the protest we staged in 2003 was widely reported as a failure. But time and persistence have proved that version wrong. Had the women's groups backed down then, we wouldn't be celebrating the admission of Rice and Moore now. Had we not changed the conversation about sex discrimination and kept it front and center every year at tournament time -- while behind the scenes facilitating $80 million in legal settlements on behalf of women working at companies whose CEOs were club members -- the issue would have quietly died away. Maybe for another century. While no one save the club leadership is privy to the decision-making, it's long past due, and the exact process doesn't matter. What does matter is that the women's movement once again succeeded. And of course after enduring taunts, insults, and even death threats, which have never stopped over the past 10 years, my personal feelings are tremendous relief and vindication. But that's tempered with concern. The challenge now moves to the CEOs of those corporations who so stubbornly hung together 10 years ago and now say it's a joyous occasion to welcome women to the golf club. Will Moore and Rice be marginalized and tokenized, like the two or three black men who were admitted after Shoal Creek? Or will the members step up to the plate and get a real plan for reaching parity? Augusta National no longer just a 'boys club' And a far more important club these same guys belong to is the business world at large. Do they welcome women into their boardrooms and the highest ranks of their companies? Not yet. Women make up only 16% of Fortune 500 board members and not even 5% of CEOs. Our research in 2005 showed that through interlocking business relationships and corporate board seats, the members of Augusta National reach into over 1,300 companies and major charities. That's a hell of a lot of influence. Let's hope they use it right before the turn of another century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Martha Burk.","For 10 years, Martha Burk and others fought to get Augusta golf club to accept women .

"(CNN) -- Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't want his children to become ""trust fund kids"" so he left his fortune to his girlfriend, a court document said. Hoffman, who died of a heroin overdose in February, wrote in his 2004 will that everything would go to ""friend and companion"" Mimi O'Donnell, who is the mother of his three children. His accountant and the lawyer who wrote the will said the actor repeatedly rejected their recommendations to create trusts for the children, according to interviews quoted in a court filing obtained by CNN. Hoffman told his lawyer that he ""did not like the idea of setting up a trust for his children,"" the lawyer said. Accountant David Friedman said Hoffman told him he ""did not want a trust in any form for his children,"" according to the court filing. Friedman recalled conversations in which Hoffman told him ""he did not want his children to be considered 'trust fund' kids."" It was a decision that Hoffman reaffirmed as recently as a year before his death, the accountant said. Hoffman told his accountant that ""Mimi would take care of the children,"" he said. Philip Seymour Hoffman's will guides son away from Hollywood . The quotes were in a report filed by the lawyer appointed by the court to represent the children's interest. That report to the New York judge overseeing the probate of Hoffman's estate recommended that the will be accepted. The will, which named O'Donnell as executor of the estate, did provide for a trust fund for the oldest son in the event his mother was not living when Hoffman died. It was signed by Hoffman in October 2004, when his son, Cooper, now 10, was just a year old and before daughters Tallulah and Willa were born. Although Hoffman and O'Donnell never married, she is the mother of all three of his children and he treated her ""in the same manner as if she were a spouse,"" the filing said. Hoffman ""simply did not believe in marriage but that did not affect his affinity or relationship with Ms. O'Donnell,"" the report said. Hoffman's lawyer said when he wrote the will that the actor instructed him to make sure ""his son would be raised in a city with art and culture,"" which led him to include a clause that asked that he be ""raised in certain geographic locales."" ""It is my strong desire, and not direction to my guardian, that my son, Cooper Hoffman be raised and reside in or near the borough of Manhattan in the State of New York, or Chicago Illinois, or San Francisco, California,"" Hoffman stated in the 13-page will. That provision was in a section that applied only if O'Donnell was not living at the time of his death and if a guardian was to be appointed for his children. If living in his preferred three cities was not possible, Hoffman requested that his son at least visit there twice a year. ""The purpose of this request is so that my son will be exposed to the culture, arts and architecture that such cities offer,"" Hoffman's will said. Noticeably absent from his list is Los Angeles, given Hoffman's fame as a Hollywood actor. Hoffman, 46, was found on the bathroom floor of his apartment, a needle in his arm. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. Hoffman, who was nominated for Academy Awards four times, won the Oscar for best actor in 2006 for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote in ""Capote.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Six simple words have sent Hello Kitty lovers into a spin. ""Hello Kitty is not a cat."" The apparently shocking revelation was made in an LA Times article published Wednesday about a retrospective of Kitty paraphernalia opening next month at the Japanese American National Museum. The story started innocently enough before the bombshell was dropped by Christine R. Yano, an anthropologist at the University of Hawaii, who has delved more deeply than most into the Hello Kitty phenomenon. ""That's one correction Sanrio made for my script for the show,"" Yano told the LA Times. ""Hello Kitty is not a cat. She's a cartoon character. She is a little girl. She is a friend. But she is not a cat. She's never depicted on all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature. She does have a pet cat of her own, however, and it's called Charmmy Kitty."" Whoa. The news reached far and wide, including backstage after the Linkin Park gig at the Minnesota State Fair. ""I just got off stage to find out that Hello Kitty is not a cat. This is worse than finding out Pluto is not a planet,"" tweeted clearly shocked rapper Mike Shinoda. For those who don't know, Hello Kitty is an international superstar who was introduced to the world in 1974 by Japanese company Sanrio. In the last 40 years her button nose has appeared on a dazzling array of merchandise, generating billions of dollars for the company. Until now, her pointy ears and whiskers gave her legion of fans the distinct impression she was feline. Wrong. Summing up the disbelief, @jkltoraay tweeted: ""You cannot say hello kitty is not a cat after 40 years no human has whiskers and pointed ears and a little yellow nose."" For some, the news raised more questions than it answered. ""Been tossing and turning for the last few hours trying to figure out how Hello Kitty isn't a cat. How is it possible? What does it mean?"" @NotKennyRogers tweeted. ""Since Hello Kitty isn't a cat, wtf is My Melody?"" tweeted @mrsunlawyer. Users raced to update Kitty's Wikipedia entry, which now reads: ""She bears the appearance of a white Japanese bobtail cat with a red bow although she is actually a little girl."" Singer Katy Perry stepped in to try to calm the masses: ""IT'S OKAY HELLO KITTY FANS, KITTY PURRY IS A CAT."" At last count it was retweeted more than 13,000 times. As the Sanrio website clearly states, Hello Kitty is a ""cheerful and happy little girl ... who lives in London with her mama (Mary White), papa (George White), and her twin sister Mimmy."" Yes, she's also British. For the record, Kitty's birthday is November 1, she likes baking and making pancakes, origami and eating apple pie. Her favorite saying is ""You can never have too many friends."" She may have lost a few today. Meow.","Hello Kitty is not a cat, anthropologist reveals ahead of retrospective .

"(CNN) -- At a friend's sleepover more than a year ago, 14-year-old Phillip Swartley pocketed change from unlocked vehicles in the neighborhood to buy chips and soft drinks. The cops caught him. Former Luzerne county President Judge Mark Ciavarella pleaded guilty, faces prison and was disbarred. There was no need for an attorney, said Phillip's mother, Amy Swartley, who thought at most, the judge would slap her son with a fine or community service. But she was shocked to find her eighth-grader handcuffed and shackled in the courtroom and sentenced to a youth detention center. Then, he was shipped to a boarding school for troubled teens for nine months. ""Yes, my son made a mistake, but I didn't think he was going to be taken away from me,"" said Swartley, a 41-year-old single mother raising two boys in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. CNN does not usually identify minors accused of crimes. But Swartley and others agreed to be named to bring public attention to the issue. As scandals from Wall Street to Washington roil the public trust, the justice system in Luzerne County, in the heart of Pennsylvania's struggling coal country, has also fallen prey to corruption. The county has been rocked by a kickback scandal involving two elected judges who essentially jailed kids for cash. Many of the children had appeared before judges without a lawyer.  Watch the corruption scandal that is rocking Pennsylvania » . The nonprofit Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia said Phillip is one of at least 5,000 children over the past five years who appeared before former Luzerne County President Judge Mark Ciavarella. Ciavarella pleaded guilty earlier this month to federal criminal charges of fraud and other tax charges, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Former Luzerne County Senior Judge Michael Conahan also pleaded guilty to the same charges. The two secretly received more than $2.6 million, prosecutors said. The judges have been disbarred and have resigned from their elected positions. They agreed to serve 87 months in prison under their plea deals. Ciavarella and Conahan did not return calls, and their attorneys told CNN that they have no comment. Ciavarella, 58, along with Conahan, 56, corruptly and fraudulently ""created the potential for an increased number of juvenile offenders to be sent to juvenile detention facilities,"" federal court documents alleged. Children would be placed in private detention centers, under contract with the court, to increase the head count. In exchange, the two judges would receive kickbacks. The Juvenile Law Center said it plans to file a class-action lawsuit this week representing what they say are victims of corruption. Juvenile Law Center attorneys cite a few examples of harsh penalties Judge Ciavarella meted out for relatively petty offenses: . Several other lawsuits on behalf of the juveniles who have appeared in Ciavarella's courtroom have emerged. The private juvenile detention centers, owned by Mid Atlantic Youth Services Corp., are still operating and are not a target of the federal investigation, according court documents. The company cooperated in the investigation, the documents said. A spokesman from the company denied that its current owner, Gregory Zappala, knew about the kickbacks. Ciavarella assured the community that he could provide justice. Elected to the bench in 1996, he once ran for judge on the promise that he would punish ""people who break the law,"" according to local reports. The corruption began in 2002, when Conahan shut down the state juvenile detention center and used money from the Luzerne County budget to fund a multimillion-dollar lease for the private facilities. Despite some raised eyebrows from the community, county commissioners approved the deal. The federal government began investigating in 2006. ""It's been a dark cloud hanging over the county for a very, very long time,"" said Luzerne County Commissioner Maryanne C. Petrilla, whose office approved the judges' budgets during the corruption. ""I'm looking forward to the ship turning around now and us moving in the right direction."" The kickback scandal highlights a major problem in the juvenile justice system in Luzerne County and across the country, attorneys say. They say hundreds of children who appeared before Ciavarella didn't have lawyers. ""Kids think very much in the present, and they have limited abilities to understand long-term consequences,"" said Robin Dahlberg, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union in New York who specializes in juvenile issues. Dahlberg's recent study in Ohio revealed that some of the counties had as many as 90 percent of children going through the court system without a lawyer. ""This Pennsylvania case is a sad reminder of why kids need an attorney,"" she said. A 1967 Supreme Court ruling says children have a right to counsel. However, many states allow children and their parents to appear without an attorney by completing a waiver. Pennsylvania is among about half of the states in the country that allow waivers to be signed for juveniles to appear before a judge without an attorney, legal experts say. In Luzerne County, teens who waived counsel were at greater risk of being sent to placement center than those with representation. About 50 percent of the children who waived counsel before Ciavarella were sent to some kind of placement, the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center reports. In comparison, the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission in Pennsylvania found that 8.4 percent of juveniles across the state wind up in placement. ""When you have this many kids waiving counsel, then that's way out of line,"" said Marsha Levick, an attorney at the Juvenile Law Center. ""There was no record [Ciavarella] was assuring the child and parent about the consequences of not having representation."" Minors charged with nonviolent crimes were often given harsher sentences than what probation officers recommended, court documents say. Other investigators say the trials lasted a few minutes at most. All four of the teens cited in this story say they appeared before Ciavarella without lawyers. ""I was sort of shocked and taken aback,"" Hillary Transue, the MySpace offender who is now 17, said of her experience in Ciavarella's courtroom in April 2007. ""I didn't really understand what was going on."" The Juvenile Law Center says it first red-flagged Ciavarella in 1999 after discovering that a 13-year-old boy was detained without being read his rights and had appeared in court without a lawyer. When the case became public, Ciavarella promised the public that every minor in his courtroom would have a lawyer. Judges must verbally explain the consequences of appearing in court without counsel to minors and parents, lawyers say. Juvenile Law Center officials say Ciavarella neglected to do so in many cases. Yet in the past five years, attorneys, law enforcement officials and other judges did not report Ciavarella's behavior to the Judicial Conduct Board of Pennsylvania, says Joseph A. Massa Jr., chief counsel at the board. Privatizing detention facilities is a growing in popularity among governments because the companies say they offer lower rates than the state. Pennsylvania has the second highest number of private facilities after Florida, accounting for about 11 percent of the private facilities in the United States, according to the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Critics say private prisons lack transparency because they don't go through the same inspections and audits as a state facility, and this may have allowed payoffs to go so long without being noticed. ""Once somebody is going to make more money by holding more kids, there is a pretty good predictable profit motive,"" said criminal justice consultant Judith Greene, who heads a nonprofit group called Justice Strategies. ""It's predictable that companies are going to tolerate certain behaviors they shouldn't."" An audit draft obtained by the Philadelphia Inquirer showed that Luzerne County was spending more than $1.2 million in expenses that weren't allowed under state regulations. The Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, the agency overseeing the audits, says the audit drafts are not final. The audits also allege that two people paid the judges. Attorneys for former Mid-Atlantic owner Robert Powell say that their client is one of those people but that he was pressured by the judges to make payments. The attorneys say Powell never offered to pay the judges, never sought to influence any juvenile case and is now cooperating with the investigation. Zappala and Powell were partners until Zappala bought out Powell in 2008. Senior Judge Arthur E. Grim of Berks County is reviewing the cases for minors who appeared before Ciavarella. Court officials say some children may have their records expunged or be granted new hearings. The Philadelphia Bar Association has expressed outrage, assuring the public that the rest of the judges on the state's bench are ""composed of highly qualified, honorable and honest people, who take their responsibilities to the public very seriously."" But some of the children -- many who, like Phillip Swartley, are now young adults -- have become jaded and believe that their cases were tainted in Ciavarella's courtroom. After being sent to boarding school, Phillip, now 15, became withdrawn and depressed, his mother says. ""What do these kids see of the legal system and of authority figures?"" Amy Swartley asked. ""These kids see people who abuse their power. Now, we have a whole county and generation of children who have lost trust in the system.""","Two Pennsylvania judges plead guilty to federal fraud charges .

"(CNN) -- As far as hitchhikers go, this one looks harmless enough. He or she -- it's hard to tell -- is short and friendly, if a little fashion-challenged. Get him talking, however, and he won't shut up. Meet hitchBOT, a talking, tweeting, bucket-bodied Canadian robot that's hitchhiking west from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Victoria, British Columbia -- a journey of nearly 4,000 miles. The robot employs artificial intelligence, speech recognition, social media and other tools to bum rides from motorists. Deposited last Monday on Highway 102 outside Halifax, hitchBot by Friday had journeyed to just west of Toronto. Its travels are being documented on Twitter, on Instagram and on the robot's website, which charts its progress on a map. The gender-neutral robot was conceived by university researchers David Harris Smith and Frauke Zeller, who view its quest as part performance art, part social experiment. As they see it, humans in popular science fiction are always wondering whether they can trust robots. Instead, they'd like to turn the question around: . Can robots trust human beings? So far, the answer appears to be yes. Three young men gave hitchBOT a ride, bought it a stuffed animal and fed it a ""meal"" of metal screws and motor oil. A couple covered hitchBOT with a plastic cape to keep it safe from the rain. And people have been recharging hitchBOT along the way by plugging it into their cars' cigarette lighters. ""People seem to be rather intrigued with hitchBOT, and take very good care (of it),"" said Smith, a communications and multimedia professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and Zeller, a communications professor at Ryerson University in Toronto, in a statement e-mailed to CNN. ""We have even seen hitchBOT lying in a camping bed under a blanket, and sitting on a toilet,"" they said, ""so people certainly have fun with it."" hitchBOT has a bucket for a torso, blue swimming-pool noodles for arms and legs and a smiling LED panel for a face, protected by a cake saver. It wears yellow gloves on its hands, and wellies -- rubber boots -- on its feet. Inside is a simple tablet PC and some components from Arduino, the open-source electronics platform. Together, all the parts cost about $1,000. ""We wanted to see what we can build on a shoestring budget ... and with tools/components that one can get in any hardware store,"" Smith and Zeller said. Thanks to its computerized innards and speech software, hitchBOT can answer basic questions, make small talk and recite info from Wikipedia. It can also get pretty chatty, not always something you want in a road-trip companion. ""We knew that sometimes ... hitchBOT won't be able to properly understand what people are saying. For these cases, we came up with the solution to let hitchBOT simply chatter away,"" its creators said. ""We taught hitchBOT to say that sometimes it gets a bit carried away, and that its programmers could only write that many scripts, hoping for people to be patient."" hitchBOT records its journey via GPS. It contains a camera and snaps random photos every half hour or so, which are moderated before being posted online to protect people's privacy. It also can record conversations with people it meets -- with their permission -- as a sort of audio diary. Humans who encounter hitchBOT are directed to its website, where instructions tell them how to handle the robot (tip: drop it off at rest stops or gas stations instead of alone on busy highways). hitchBOT's final destination is the Open Space artist center in Victoria, British Columbia, which means the robot will likely have to hitch a ride on a boat. Nobody knows exactly how long his cross-country trip will take. Smith and Zeller say the goal of their project is to examine the relationship between humans and ""smart"" technologies while seeing whether an anthropomorphic robot can engender good will, cooperation and even affection. The two researchers are worried that someone might mistreat hitchBOT. But the journey's success so far has allayed their fears a little. ""We have seen so much support on social media and through other channels that we are now more optimistic,"" they said. ""They (the robot's drivers) all say that wherever they go with hitchBOT, they meet lots of people through it. ""Everybody stops, takes pictures, and wants to talk ... so this is an interesting case of technology bringing humans closer to each other.""","A talking robot is hitchhiking west from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Victoria, British Columbia .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia man was killed and his daughter critically injured Sunday when an airplane struck them as they walked along a Florida beach. Sarasota County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Wendy Rose said Venice Municipal Airport officials reported a plane in distress Sunday afternoon. The pilot of a 1972 Piper Cherokee radioed that he would be unable to make it back to the airport and that he was instead going to attempt a landing on Caspersen Beach, just to the south. The plane landed and hit Ommy Irizarry, 36, and his daughter, Oceana, 9, about 2:45 p.m., according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration. Irizarry died on the scene. His daughter was airlifted to All Children's Hospital and is believed to be in critical condition, according to the sheriff's office. ""The dad looked very bad,"" witness Zack Arceneaux told CNN affiliate Bay News 9. ""They were performing CPR on him. He had blood on his face. It looked like he wasn't breathing at all."" ""It's the last thing you'd expect,"" Arceneaux said to CNN affiliate WTSP. ""I didn't hear anything. Actually I thought the motor must've went out. I didn't hear anything.

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Her ankles and wrists are shackled. She's wearing used sweats in the bright colors of the jailhouse, orange, blue and yellow. She shuffles to the courtroom to face the judge, her mother, and an uncertain future. Selena is a 13-year-old who was sold for sex. She wants to go home to her house in the suburbs and the baby sister she hardly knows. And now, facing a sympathetic judge and a loving mother who wants to make sure she's safe, Selena is being told she can't go home. ""I want to go home and I want to be with my family, that's all I want,"" she tells Juvenile Court Judge William Voy, her face bathed in tears. ""This isn't making me any better in here."" Selena was arrested by undercover police on the Vegas strip on prostitution charges. But although she exchanged sex for money, in the eyes of the law, she's a victim, by virtue of her age and the circumstances under which she was sold: by a pimp on the website backpage.com, a pimp who used drugs to entice her, and took everything she earned. ""It made me feel so nasty, I always just want a shower and get it off. I was like, oh, it's so disgusting,"" she said.  ""And it never made me feel pretty, not one time, not one time."" She told us she was seeing four or five men a day, at the standard rate of $300 for an hour, $150 for a half. She may be a victim, but she can't go home, because no one trusts that she won't run again, back into the arms of a pimp. Like so many other underage trafficking victims, Selena is a chronic runaway, picked up by a pimp after she took off from home. ""I was at the bus stop and he said 'Oh, do you need a ride?' and I was like 'Yeah I do.' I liked him a lot. I was straight up obsessed. I was like 'Wow, he's so cute,'"" she says from an interview room at the Clark County Juvenile Justice Center, where she's being held. ""It wasn't just at first like 'Oh bitch, go get me money,' it wasn't like that at first -- but then it got like that."" Home for Selena is a nice single-family house in a new development on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Selena's mother shows us her room. It looks like any other 13-year-old girl's, except for the lipstick scrawl on her bedroom mirror spelling out the names of boys her mother has never met: boys, or maybe men. ""I don't know. I mean, honestly, I don't know what's happening,"" her mother says. ""I only knows what she tells me. And she doesn't really tell me anything. So I don't know."" Selena and her mother agreed to speak with us on camera.  Their names have been changed so that any future internet searches don't link her back to this story. But speaking on camera under these circumstances is a mark of bravery, and also of desperation. ""People say, 'Oh, Las Vegas,' but it's not just Las Vegas,"" says Selena's mother, who is a schoolteacher. ""You hear everywhere of kids, you know, being picked up and you never ever see them again. So it's a horrible feeling. And no matter how many times that I talk to her about it, it's just like she's just not getting it. She's not."" She's not alone. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, there are at least 100,000 underage girls being sex trafficked in America today. That's a conservative estimate based on what little hard data currently exists; NCMEC believes the real number could be as high as 300,000. Most are runaways, suffering from psychological problems or drug dependence, picked up and sold by pimps for staggering profits. According to studies, pimps can make up to half a million dollars a year, and they frequently prey on the young and the vulnerable. The pimps ply their trade on the web, the new marketplace for underage sex trafficking. Last year, victims' advocates called the internet classified site Craigslist's Adult Service Section the ""Walmart of child sex trafficking."" CNN investigated Craigslist, posting an ad and receiving numerous calls from men seeking sex. That investigation helped spark a national conversation and outrage, as well as a call from 17 attorneys general around the country for Craigslist to shut down its adult services section. Video: Confronting Craigslist . But when Craigslist shut down its section, the escort ads migrated to another site, backpage.com. We decided to investigate Backpage after advocacy groups accused the website, which is owned by the Village Voice Media Group, of facilitating the trafficking of underage girls. According to the AIM Group, an internet consulting firm, Backpage's escort site earned an estimated $20 million in 2010.  Its profits soared after Craigslist decided to pull the plug on its adult services section. We found cases all over the country of underage girls being sold for sex on Backpage: Selena in Vegas, a 12-year-old in suburban Maryland, and a 14-year-old in St. Louis. For months, CNN has requested an interview with Backpage and Village Voice Media executives to talk about the accusations, but the company has refused. Last fall, Backpage hired internet security advisor Hemu Nigam to implement ""a holistic plan centered around preventing criminal activity on our site."" We wanted to know what that ""holistic plan"" was, but Nigam wouldn't talk to us either. Full nudity appears to have disappeared from the site, but suspect ads with tag lines such as ""Daddy's Little Girl"" are common. We posted our own ad, using a photo of CNN correspondent Amber Lyon when she was 14 years old.  She told the men who called that she was underage; most didn't care. Video: CNN's Amber Lyon posts Backpage ad . One man offered Lyon $30,000 to travel to another state and meet a wealthy friend of his to have sex in an expensive hotel. We went to the hotel, confirmed the offer was genuine, but stopped before accepting the money. But the point where we stopped is the start for many underage prostitutes, like Selena. Selena desperately wants to return home, but the judge and her mother fear she will run away again and fall into the hands of another pimp. So they came up with a short-term solution: to send her to a facility in Salt Lake City that can at least deal with her drug problems. A private foundation is standing by to assist with long-term care when she gets out. But there are no guarantees. Her mother remembers Selena when she was 11, getting good grades, a happy kid, before it all went wrong. She sometimes wishes her daughter would be like other kids, just for a day. ""You know, just to have a kid that actually just goes to school and comes home and does their homework and watches TV, you know. And it's tough. But that's not the case,"" she says. ""I don't want to take anything away from her because she's great, in her own way. It's just, I don't know, I feel like she's lost -- to be honest, I do.""","Selena, 13, was sold for sex on backpage.com .

"(CNN) -- Did ISIS use a notorious former CIA interrogation technique on Western hostages? At least four ISIS hostages in Syria were waterboarded during their captivity, the Washington Post reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the treatment of the abducted Westerners. Among those waterboarded was James Foley, the American journalist who was beheaded by the terror group. Waterboarding has a long history, but most recently the method is attached to the CIA, which used the technique during interrogations of terror suspects after 9-11. Waterboarding is an interrogation technique in which water is poured over a cloth covering the subject's face, creating the sensation of drowning. A senior U.S. official declined to confirm to CNN if the waterboarding claims are true, saying that such details would not be discussed out of sensitivity to the families of those still being held. ""As we have said, hostages held by ISIL are at risk every day they are in ISIL's custody, given what we know about the nature of this brutal group,"" the official said, using an alternate acronym for ISIS. A 2005 Justice Department memo -- released by the Obama administration -- revealed that alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been waterboarded 183 times in March 2003. Lawyers during the George W. Bush administration justified the use of so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" including waterboarding. His administration viewed the techniques as necessary to protect Americans from the terrorist threat. President Barack Obama's position is that waterboarding amounts to torture and ""violates our ideals and our values."" ""That's why I put an end to these practices,"" he said in 2009. ""I am absolutely convinced it was the right thing to do -- not because there might not have been information that was yielded by these various detainees who were subjected to this treatment, but because we could have gotten this information in other ways, in ways that were consistent with our values, in ways that were consistent with who we are."" CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","The Washington Post reports that ISIS waterboarded its hostages .

"(CNN) -- The meeting on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko, marks the beginning of a new phase in the conflict between the two countries. Military analysts say that the date by which Putin could have safely hoped to initiate and complete a full scale invasion of Ukraine before the onset of winter has already passed, so the threat of an open military confrontation has receded and there is space to give diplomacy a chance. Yet it would be premature to conclude that jaw-jaw is about to replace war-war entirely. If there are powerful forces driving both sides to the negotiating table, there are also major differences that continue to keep them apart. We can expect a tense and difficult winter ahead. The main reason Putin is now willing to explore a negotiated solution is that Western sanctions are beginning to bite. Currency instability, accelerating capital flight and vanishing growth rates all point to a deep and sustained recession if the current political uncertainty persists and Western pressure is maintained. As Putin noted in a recent speech, Russia cannot fence itself off from the outside world. There isn't a go it alone option if Russia is denied access to global markets and finance. Putin therefore needs to find a way of normalizing relations with the West and bringing sanctions to an end in exchange for stabilizing the situation and allowing Ukraine to function as a country. Without this, patriotic fervor is likely to subside in the face of economic hardship and record approval ratings will quickly return to their pre-crisis lows. Closely related to this is the fate of Crimea, the territory annexed by Russia earlier this year. The picture emerging from the peninsula is one of steep price rises and acute material shortages as the problem of resupplying the territory without land access from Ukraine becomes apparent. A successful Russian invasion of eastern and southern Ukraine would have resolved that issue at a stroke, but with that option apparently off the table Putin faces real difficulties. What many saw as a geopolitical masterstroke in March is set to become a major financial burden stretching years into the future unless some kind of agreement can be struck. Kiev and the West will never recognize the annexation of Crimea, but arrangements for the supply of water, energy and other goods will undoubtedly form part of the wider negotiation. For Poroshenko the issues are equally stark. The economic outlook for Ukraine remains dire unless the crisis can be brought to an end and the country is able to function to some extent as a single unit once again. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains at the expense of the separatists over the last couple of months, but Kiev probably doesn't have the means to bring the insurgency to an end by military means alone. Russia's capacity to destabilize the east remains immense and recent steps to reinforce the separatists and ""Ukrainianise"" its leadership suggest that Moscow is preparing to play the long game. Energy is another area of concern for Poroshenko. In the absence of a new agreement on gas supply from Russia, reserves will probably be insufficient to cover demand in the cold months ahead. Reverse flow from the West might help to mitigate the problem, but a harsh winter would leave Ukraine badly exposed. Although both sides face major pressure to reach a negotiated settlement, they remain far apart on the substance. Russia sees Ukraine as part of its sphere of ""privileged interests"" and is determined to prevent the country moving closer to the West. Kiev wants to maintain an independent foreign policy, including the option of deeper integration with the West. The terrain on which this struggle is being played out is the debate over Ukraine's constitutional future and relationship between the center and the regions in particular. In the absence of a friendly government in Kiev, Russia is promoting a form of federalism that in reality looks more like confederalism. This would give Russian-speaking regions of the east control not only over their own domestic affairs, such as education, public services and the local economy, but also the right to determine their own foreign alignments, security structures and possibly border controls. The ideal model for Russia is the Dayton Agreement that brought the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina to an end in 1995. This created two constitutionally autonomous entities, each with a veto over foreign policy and other major national decisions. Russia has been able to forge close ties to Republika Srpska and relies on it to block Bosnia's membership of NATO. For understandable reasons the government in Kiev is unwilling to countenance an agreement on this basis. Although it is prepared to cede much greater autonomy to the regions in crucial matters like language and education, it recognizes that Putin-style ""federalism"" would put a block closer ties to the EU and become a ramp for the soft integration of its eastern regions into a Russian sphere of influence. Poroshenko is under intense pressure, especially from Germany, to negotiate some kind of decentralized arrangement, but the separatists and their Russian sponsors show no signs of lowering their demands to the point where an agreement might be achievable. Although an end to the crisis is to be hoped for, the starting point of European diplomacy should be that a quick solution is unlikely and that the reason for this is Moscow's unreasonable expectation of a veto over Ukraine's future. Germany should stop pressuring Ukraine's leaders to consider proposals that would effectively lead to the break up of their country. Instead effort should be focused on strengthening Ukraine's sovereignty and long-term bargaining power in relation to Russia. Measures to increase energy supplies, provide economic support and strengthen Ukraine's defense capacities over the difficult winter months ahead should be priorities. At the same time, economic pressure on Russia should be maintained and stepped up. This is a battle of wills and Putin won't reconsider his position unless the West is able to demonstrate the resolve needed to prevail.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Every day, William Schmidt gives job seekers with a not-so-great job history, a gap on their résumé or even a criminal record, a second chance. How does he do it? He fabricates job references to cover up their sordid pasts. Schmidt is the founder of CareerExcuse.com, a Web site that says it will fill any gap on your résumé by acting as your past employer. It will go as far as creating a new company with an accompanying phone number, logo, Web site and LinkedIn profile. He says the site is designed to ""help our subscribers meet the needs of the modern day job market."" ""Many of our subscribers tell me how a bad reference from a previous employer is akin to having a criminal record and is preventing them from providing for their family. All they ask is for a second chance,"" Schmidt says. While Schmidt says he feels good about the service he provides for job seekers, naturally, not everyone shares his opinion. After all, not only is it unethical to lie about anything on your job application, but some argue that it puts those who have legitimate references at an unfair disadvantage. ""It's like using a professional photographer, who helps you look your best, versus using someone else's photo. One is enhancing your appearance, while the other is blatant misrepresentation,"" says David Wright, author of ""Get a Job! Your Guide to Making Successful Career Moves."" ""People do make mistakes and bad choices. Winners learn from the mistakes while losers try to cover them up, hide them or keep making the same mistakes over and over while expecting different results."" Is the economy to blame? Many people can agree that finding a job today is difficult and that not having anyone in your corner to toot your horn could be detrimental. Schmidt said he got the idea for his company after perusing posts on Twitter, where he said he saw many users asking strangers for references. ""We understand that there are over 12 million workers who have been fired or let go from former employers in the last eight years. With six applicants for every job today, anyone with a blemish in their career can be left out,"" Schmidt says. Lauren Milligan, résumé expert and job coach for ResuMayday, says that it's sad that job seekers would think they had to fake their references, but that she can see how the poor economy could lead to making desperate choices. ""If a candidate was previously turned down because of a lack of reference, that otherwise honest person may decide to unethically stack the deck in his or her favor,"" she says. ""It's kind of pathetic that anyone would have to [use a service for a reference], but perhaps it could be that 'rock bottom' that turns around bad behavior."" Is it worth it? Some job seekers may think they need to use a fake reference because they were fired or need to cover a gap in their employment history. Experts say that paying someone to do that for you is likely a waste -- especially since many employers ignore the references you give them anyway. ""Having consulted on hundreds of hires, I don't care about the three personal references the candidate has given. Anyone can find three people that will swear they can turn water into wine,"" says Barry Maher, career consultant and owner of Barry Maher & Associates. ""I check everything else I can. And not just the last job, which may be a service that will vouch for them, but the job before that and the one before that, all the way down the line."" Checking references all the way down the line has also become much easier with the advent of social networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn, which provide a place for you to list your employment history. Employers aren't stupid -- if a few things don't match up, they'll catch on pretty quickly. ""The good thing about social networking is that the world has become a much smaller, accessible place. The bad thing about social networking is that the world has become a much smaller, accessible place,"" Milligan says. ""Within a few minutes, I believe that anyone with a mid-level of expertise in LinkedIn or Facebook (combined with an elementary-level [Internet] search) could identify fake information. Hiring mistakes are so costly; due diligence can really pay off in a company's recruiting process,"" Milligan says. And while employers cross-reference information that candidates provide them, including references, services like CareerExcuse.com have an answer for that, too. ""CareerExcuse.com uses [social networks] to our advantage,"" Schmidt says. ""As a matter of fact, it is the Internet and the reliance of the Internet by human resource managers that make our services work so successfully."" Consequences of your actions . Every action has a consequence, including providing a fake job reference to a potential employer. Although you may not get caught, you'll likely have to deal with trying to cover up your lies and forever worrying about if you'll get caught. ""Liars are always going to use lies to try and put themselves at an advantage over honest people,"" Wright says. ""This may be effective in the short run, but over time, honesty wins out because eventually lies do get found out, and liars are exposed for who they really are. As in a great quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln: 'You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time,'"" Wright warns. The truth will set you free . If you feel the need to use a fake job reference, try these three tips from our experts instead: . 1. Turn your negatives into positives . ""Nothing builds credibility like exposing your own negatives. You can turn them into positives, selling points, even bragging points,"" Maher says. He gives the example of Clyde Thompson, who ""provided us with all the reasons why we may not want to hire him; all the ones that we probably would have brought up on our own once he was out of the room, and a few more we might never have come up. Clyde presented his unemployability in a light made it appear that he'd be a more reliable employee. And his honesty gained him a massive amount of credibility."" 2. Don't give up . Before giving up and resigning yourself to having no references, Milligan suggests scouring LinkedIn and Facebook to try to reconnect with former colleagues. Or, consider if you've volunteered anywhere, played on a sports team or been a member of industry associations. Reach out to peers from these organizations for a reference. ""References don't only have to come from supervisors or co-workers,"" she says. ""Perhaps company clients or vendors would have a few good things to say about you."" If you still can't find anyone to give you reference by the time an employer asks for one, Milligan suggests saying, ""Unbelievably, I wasn't able to connect with any of my former supervisors or co-workers after ABC Co. shut down unexpectedly. Thanks to social networking, I'm in the process of trying to find people, but it just hasn't panned out yet. In lieu of that, I would assure you that I wouldn't have been able to achieve (insert career success here) if I wasn't good at my job and I fully expect to create more successes like that one, for you."" 3. Tackle the issue head-on . Instead of trying to sweep the issue under the rug, be the first one to address it, Wright suggests. ""If you know you've got something bad that would probably show up on a background check, it can help to be proactive, particularly when you've established some degree of rapport with the hiring manager,"" he suggests. ""Tell them that you want to be upfront with them -- you made a mistake in the past and they'll probably find out anyway, but you'd rather them hear it from you first. By being proactive, you have the opportunity to position it better as well, emphasizing your strengths or how you overcame that experience."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Authorities say a Maryland woman suffocated her two kids, 1 and 3 years old, and then told a relative what she'd done. Prince George's County police accused 24-year-old Sonya Katarina Spoon of suffocating 1-year-old Ayden Spoon and 3-year-old Kayla Thompson over the weekend. The children died at a hospital, authorities say. Police say they found plastic bags near both of the kids. Spoon gave police a detailed statement on how the children died, according to police. She is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and is being held without bail pending a court appearance, according to authorities.

"(CNN) -- Airborne for white, sandy beaches, turquoise Cuban waters and swaying palms, two women apparently broke out their duty-free booze on Wednesday and partied hearty in a passenger jet bathroom. So terribly hearty, that they got Sunwing Flight 656 a military jet escort back to the Canadian airport from which it departed. Prosecutors on Thursday charged Melana Muzikante, 26, and Lilia Ratmanski, 25, each with two counts of mischief, one count of smoking on an aircraft, one count of endangering the safety of an aircraft and with uttering a threat to cause death or bodily harm, according to Constable Lillian Fitzpatrick of Peel Regional Police. A judge released them on $2,500 bail each after they spent a night in a Canadian jail, but Fitzpatrick said Muzikante's surety won't arrive until Friday, meaning she'll spend Thursday night behind bars. It was not clear late Thursday who her attorney was; attempts to reach Ratmanski were unsuccessful. From champagne to swill .

"Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- The clerks at Apple's store on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade are well-trained. When asked recently by a reporter about a new Apple Store rumored to be opening down the street, one worker said he didn't know about it, and even if he did, he couldn't say. He did point out that someone is building a store with a glass roof that looks a lot like some other Apple stores. Another employee smiled, looked away and said he didn't know anything. But according to a person familiar with the plans who is bound by a nondisclosure agreement, Apple has already begun work on such a store in Santa Monica. Like the Peter Bohlin-designed Apple Store on New York's Upper West Side, it will have a tall, striking glass storefront, the person said. And like an upcoming store in a suburban Seattle mall, the new store will open next year a short walk away from a smaller one, which will close. For this development in the beach town near Los Angeles, Apple has gone to extremes to ensure secrecy. The behavior has perplexed and infuriated city officials who are unclear why Apple would feel the need to hide a new store when it already has one a couple of blocks away. The Santa Monica store episode also illustrates Apple's unusually covert way of doing business. Interviews with almost two dozen people familiar with Apple Store negotiations say the Cupertino, California, company sometimes employs uncommon legal tactics, refuses to name itself in public documents and hearings, and has sworn city government officials to secrecy. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. 'Nobody would talk' Howard Robinson, the real estate developer who has represented Apple at Santa Monica city meetings, has carefully avoided mentioning Apple by name. When reached by phone late one day in September, he declined to comment on the project, citing a confidentiality agreement with the company. Apple, which recently began construction on the site, has managed to skate through most of the city's stringent public reviews. In the first, Santa Monica's Planning Commission employed an unusual measure at an August 17 meeting. The only development proposal on the agenda that night involved tearing down the former site of a three-story Borders bookstore in the city's prized outdoor shopping district and constructing a 75-foot edifice that would require a special permit. Instead of discussing and then voting on the project, as is usually the case, officials placed it on the consent calendar, which allows the commission members to vote on it immediately without input from residents in the audience. From proposal to unanimous approval, the entire process took 30 seconds, an archived video from the meeting shows. ""Nobody would talk about the fact that it was Apple,"" said Peggy Clifford, who has covered the public meetings for her Santa Monica Dispatch blog. ""They really didn't want to have to say anything about it."" Even Tony Kim, the city planner who was assigned to and recommended the approval of the project, declined to name the incoming tenant. ""I've been asked not to divulge that information,"" Kim said in an interview. ""I really can't say. I want to respect the applicant's wishes."" Several aspects of his dealings with the company for the new store were out of the ordinary, he said. Still, he favored having the new store. ""It was a project that has met code, and it was, we thought, a well-done project that didn't have any significant issues,"" Kim said. ""It fit in with the neighborhood, and it was compatible in our opinion."" Michael Folonis, chairman of Santa Monica's Architectural Review Board, does not agree with Kim's assessment. ""It's a one-liner,"" Folonis said in an interview. ""There's nothing about it to me as an architect that holds my interest at all, and from an environmental point of view, I think it's irresponsible."" The September 19 meeting . Apple's team presented the new store to the board of architects on September 19. According to an audio recording of the meeting, Robinson, the developer, said he was ""representing a retail user who prefers to remain unbranded at this time."" Folonis said he was offended that the documents related to the project were submitted after the meeting had started, and were incomplete. The other board members agreed, and Folonis suggested they vote to delay the process, giving Apple more time to submit a complete report. Folonis and another member, John Ellis, raised concerns about the building's sustainability. Glass structures might work in New York, in the shadows of tall buildings, but how would they fare under direct California sun? ""When I'm in these stores,"" Ellis began, paused and then whispered, ""You know, I mean, the Apple stores, they sometimes can get hot because there are so many people."" Later that night, Ellis said: ""That's a little kind of irritating that we can't say its name, but so, that makes it seem veiled in some sort of mystery to me."" The architectural board voted unanimously to delay the project. But six minutes later, as the board was preparing to adjourn, the Apple team returned and requested that the board vote again. ""They want us to vote on it?"" asked Lynn Robb, the board's vice chairwoman. ""Um,"" Folonis stammered, ""do we have a precedent for this?"" Apple's developer was allowed again to plead his case. Issues of sustainability and environmental impact are outside of the Architectural Review Board's purview, and therefore, should not be factored into the reasoning for the vote, he said. ""I'm sorry, but I feel you guys were off on a tangent there,"" Robinson said. ""We asked you to look at the design aspects of this building."" Robinson addressed the question of how green the building would be by saying, ""This company has a proven track record in sustainability. They have many, many programs. They've been well-known for it around the world."" Robb retorted that it was disingenuous of Robinson to tout Apple's environmental record without ever saying the name of the company. ""Is it worth stepping back and being more critical of who they are and what they're making?"" Robb said later in an interview with CNN. ""Are there things we're not seeing because it's so beautiful? Or because we love Apple so much?"" Yet, when it came time to vote for the second time that night, Robb gave her nod to the project. So did other board members who praised the store's conceptual design. ""It's going to be the most amazing, you know, most interesting building on the Promenade, probably by far,"" Ellis said. ""I have seen other ones of these built, and I'm glad that we're going to get this new version here in Santa Monica soon, hopefully soon."" Of the five board members present at the meeting on September 19, Folonis was the only one to vote against the proposal. It was only the second time he had voted ""no"" in his seven-year tenure, he said. As the stunned board members ended the meeting after passing Apple's project, Folonis could be heard mumbling, ""Coming back in here and manipulating us."" Apple's perceived arrogance . In interviews, Robb described Apple as arrogant, its store architecture as temple-like and its demands for secrecy as odd. Folonis described the secrecy aspect as silly and childish, and the company's attitude as overly confident. Concerns over Apple's perceived arrogance have been a topic of conversation among the company's board members, including Art Levinson and Al Gore, according to accounts in the new ""Steve Jobs"" biography of the late Apple co-founder by Walter Isaacson. ""I'm not worried about that,"" the book quotes Jobs as saying, ""because we're not arrogant."" Whatever the motivation, Apple's behind-the-curtain strategies have been working. Getting approval for a retail development in Santa Monica, especially on the Promenade, is notoriously difficult and slow-moving, said a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to protect his relationship with the city. ""Somehow this thing is being approved very quickly,"" said Arthur Pearlman, a commercial real estate exec who lives in Santa Monica but has not done business with the city. ""Something is going on there that doesn't sound right."" Apple's contentious retail project was finally challenged on October 20. Daniel Jansenson, an architect in Santa Monica, filed an appeal with the city's Planning Commission. ""Obviously someone is in a big hurry to get this approved,"" Jansenson said in an interview. ""There just was not sufficient information provided."" At a hearing, Jansenson and Folonis argued the new store should have to defer to thorough public scrutiny and play by the same rules that apply to every other developer in the city. One resident, apparently frustrated with all of the secrecy, approached the microphone for no other reason than to address the elephant in the room. ""We all know what's going to be there,"" said Jerry Rubin with a dramatic pause. ""An Apple Store."" Rubin's prediction appears to be coming true. The appeal failed, and Apple is not expected to face any more procedural hurdles in Santa Monica that could slow the store's development. For Apple, the quietest path often leads to victory.","Apple is opening a new retail store next year in Santa Monica, California, sources say .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The family of a mentally ill British man sentenced to death in Pakistan for blasphemy is calling on authorities to release him. A court in the city of Rawalpindi last week handed down the punishment to Muhammad Asghar, 69, over charges alleging that he wrote letters claiming to be a prophet. But his family, his lawyer and a British legal aid group say the court failed to take into account the mental state of Asghar, who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The sentencing hearing took place last week behind closed doors without his legal team's knowledge, they say, and his lawyer has been blocked from visiting him since. ""We are really upset and concerned that they will never release him and that he will die in jail,"" his family said in a statement released Monday by the British legal aid and advocacy group Reprieve. ""He has already attempted suicide unsuccessfully."" Asghar was convicted under Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, which human rights groups say is used to settle personal scores and persecute minorities. Now, his family and lawyer are concerned that his legal team will be prevented from meeting a key deadline this week to file an appeal that they say would keep important evidence about his mental health admissible in the case. History of mental illness . Asghar was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the city where he was living at the time, and kept under observation in the hospital for over a month. Later that year, he traveled with his wife to Pakistan, where he owns a number of properties. He was arrested near Rawalpindi and jailed in September 2010 on allegations that during a dispute with one of his tenants, he had sent letters claiming to be a prophet. Under Pakistani law, blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad is punishable by death or life imprisonment. A Pakistani law firm took up his case and has been working on it for the past three years. The lawyer for the firm who has been representing Asghar spoke to CNN about the case on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns -- the firm has received threats in the past. The lawyer says Asghar denies sending the letters, describing the case as the result of a property dispute that turned bad. Tackling religious intolerance and violence in Pakistan . 'Horrific jail conditions' Asghar's family and legal team have criticized his treatment in jail and the way the Pakistani court system handled the case. ""The dates kept being moved forward so that by the time the trial concluded he had already been in horrific jail conditions sharing a cell with several other men for three years,"" the family said in its statement. ""Throughout this time he had minimum access to medication that might have helped his mental illness."" In early 2012, he tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide, his lawyer says, and spent time in the hospital recovering. A medical report about his mental state, provided to the court around that time, was flawed and lacked proper psychiatric assessment, the lawyer says. Psychiatrists willing to testify in the case were deterred because of direct threats to their security, the lawyer says. An independent analysis of Mohammad Asghar's case by the Pakistan Association for Mental Health stressed the need to put him on suicide watch saying ""his threats to commit suicide cannot be taken lightly."" Opinion: A war is raging against free speech . Appeal deadline looming . The legal team that had been working on his case was replaced by a state counsel in the final stages of the trial after filing a request to have the judge replaced on the grounds of probably bias, Reprieve said. Members of the legal team have been visiting Asghar at Rawalpindi's Central Jail, known as Adiala Jail, where he is being held. But they are no longer able to get permission to see him. That's a big issue because the lawyers have until Thursday to file an appeal before the High Court. If they don't make the deadline, an automatic ""jail appeal"" will be filed. In that case, Asghar's lawyers ""will be barred from raising crucial evidence of Mr. Asghar's mental health and other fair trial issues on appeal,"" Reprieve says. Asghar's lawyer told CNN that without a proper appeal, the case might languish in the court system for years. The lawyer said that considering Muhammad Asghar's frail mental health and suicidal tendencies, she fears he ""might not survive"" that time period. His relatives say they want Pakistan to release him so ""he can be treated appropriately for his medical condition."" Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, a senior official at the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said in a statement that Britain will be raising concerns over Asghar's sentence ""in the strongest possible terms with the Pakistani government."" Pakistani officials weren't immediately available for comment on the matter Tuesday. Judges under pressure . Accusations of blasphemy often unleash fierce passions in Pakistan, drawing angry crowds who gather outside court hearings demanding punishment before cases have even been heard. ""So much pressure is on the police and judiciary to take action that even in the face of overwhelming evidence of innocence or shoddy evidence against the accused, no judge is willing to be seen to be lenient,"" Asghar's lawyer told CNN. ""There was a mob outside the police station when Asghar was arrested, there was a mob outside the hospital when he was rushed there after attempting suicide,""she said. ""People leak information and put pressure on the justice system."" Although human rights advocates say minorities are often the targets of blasphemy charges, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says the majority of people accused of or imprisoned for blasphemy are Muslims. Pakistan's population is overwhelmingly Muslim. In January 2011, Punjab Governor Salman Taseer was shot to death by one of his security guards after publicly supporting a Christian woman accused of blasphemy and calling for a change in the law. In 2012, the case of a Rimsha Masih, a Christian teenager accused of blasphemy, caused an international outcry. Charges against her were eventually dropped, but she and her family were forced to go into hiding. That's why Asghar's lawyers are so concerned about his safety. Members of the firm representing him have faced direct threats to their safety because of the case, his lawyer said. In 2012, six people at the firm quit in one day because they were concerned for their safety. But despite the risks, the firm has stuck by him.","Muhammad Asghar was convicted of charges he claimed to be prophet .

"(CNN) -- Syrian warplanes reportedly targeted Iraq this week. Scores of civilians were killed at markets and gas stations in Anbar province Tuesday, local leaders told CNN. A militant group called ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has been pushing into Iraq, shaking the country, its leadership and, in turn, threatening the region. But what does it mean that Syria reportedly is now attacking its neighbor? Here are some answers to get you up to speed: . What does ISIS want, and how is that related to Iraq and Syria? ISIS includes mostly Sunni militants who want to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria. In the towns it controls in Syria, it has imposed Sharia law. Women must be covered, music is prohibited, girls and boys must not mingle at school. The group's tactics are so ruthless even al Qaeda has distanced itself. For example, ISIS kidnapped more than 140 Kurdish schoolboys in Syria last month and forced them to take daily lessons in radical Islamic theory, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. The militant group was born in Iraq, initially called the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella organization headed by al Qaeda. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, served four years in a U.S. prison camp for insurgents, at Bucca in southern Iraq. He was released in 2009. The Islamic State in Iraq relocated to Syria and eventually became known by its new name, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Is ISIS capable of getting what it wants? Regrouping and strengthening in Syria, ISIS became well-financed and highly organized. Today, the group has grown large enough to divide the entire region along sectarian lines, experts say. ISIS has produced and attracted more jihadists and foreign fighters than the war in Iraq ever did. It has more suicide bombers at its disposal, more heavy weaponry and vehicles and more money than any other terrorist organization in the world. It also has launched an intensive and sophisticated media campaign with flashy videos directed at Westerners, enticing them to join the fight. ISIS has also employed a classic guerilla warfare tactic -- the militants live among civilians. It would be difficult to target these militants in general strikes without injuring or killing innocent people. Why would Syria reportedly bomb Iraq now? Bashar al-Assad's regime knows where ISIS bases are inside Syria, but its response to ISIS has been fairly muted for months. The existence of ISIS has helped to justify the Syrian government's often-used line that it is fighting ""terrorists,"" and opposition activists have long accused the regime of allowing the group to operate and grow, pointing to the government's constant barrel bombing of civilian neighborhoods in places such as Aleppo, while ISIS positions remain largely untargeted. But since the militant group has taken over large parts of northern Iraq recently, Syria has intensified its targeted campaign of ISIS positions, particularly in Raqqa, Syria, where ISIS has operated its headquarters for some time. Damascus denies bombing positions in Iraq, but several sources, including an eyewitness and the head of the Anbar provincial council, said Syrian warplanes launched this week's strikes. CNN is seeking a response from the Syrian government. It's unlikely al-Assad anticipated that ISIS would achieve such impressive and significant victories in Iraq. The only weapon Syrians have in the border area is air power; Syrian ground forces pulled out long ago. Bombing Iraq now serves to clip ISIS' wings a little. Map: Where ISIS has taken control in Iraq . How are the Iraqi and Syrian conflicts linked? Under Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the Iraqi government has gradually become closer to the Syrian regime. They share allies such as Iran and Hezbollah and enemies such as al Qaeda, ISIS, Sunni extremists and Saudi Arabia, too. The old colonial borders in the region are disappearing, and a conflict is emerging that is more Sunni versus Shiite. Al-Maliki, some experts said, stoked that sectarian tension even more in a speech Wednesday in which the Shiite leader slammed Sunnis. He blamed his political rivals for ""coordinating"" the crisis in Iraq and accused Sunnis of collaborating with militants. See: Al-Maliki changes tune on unity government . What are the Iraq military's shortcomings? Iraq is using its air force -- what's left of it -- to fight back against ISIS. Iraq has initiated airstrikes, but targeting the group means putting a scope on constantly moving targets. ISIS uses pickups, not tanks. Without precise intelligence from the ground, battling ISIS is tough. And it's critical to remember that Iraq lost virtually all its air power with the 2003 U.S. invasion. The Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances. The governor of Kirkuk told CNN that the Iraq force is a ""checkpoint army,"" meaning that it is able to set up and run checkpoints but isn't sophisticated enough to fight ISIS cells. The Iraqi army also tends to use a counterproductive strategy of rounding up individuals as a method of control, aggravating the local population. Finally, the Iraqi military is up against a terror organization more powerful than anything that the U.S. military was battling and struggled to overcome. Why has U.S. air power not been used against ISIS in Iraq? Many experts believe that U.S. airstrikes in Iraq are far too risky and might not deliver the results the United States wants. Again, consider that ISIS is mixed among the civilian population. Airstrikes may kill innocent people. And there are logistical questions that have to be answered. Where would the air power come from? Bases in Turkey perhaps? Would Turkey give its green light? Also, some in Iraq perceive that the United States put al-Maliki in power and supported his regime for years, and U.S. interference with air power might not be welcomed. The United States has to worry about Iran, too. U.S. strikes in Iraq could undermine progress Iran and the United States have made on the issue of nuclear weapons. Also, ISIS is not the only group fighting to gain control of Iraq. Sunni insurgent groups that were active during the U.S.-led invasion have also joined in the battle. Sunni tribal leaders all oppose al-Maliki and view him and his Shiite-dominated government as a bigger threat to the country than ISIS. Members of insurgent groups not aligned with ISIS could be killed, possibly creating a new set of enemies. Any U.S. airstrikes in Iraq could further deepen the divide if there's a perception the action was done to bolster al-Maliki's government. It could also further alienate Sunni groups whose support eventually will be needed for any sort of political process to succeed in the country. Op-ed: How ISIS threatens the wider world .

"(CNN) -- Miep Gies, who ensured the diary of Anne Frank did not fall into the hands of Nazis after the teen's arrest, has died. She was 100. Gies was among a team of Dutch citizens who hid the Frank family of four and four others in a secret annex in Amsterdam, Netherlands, during World War II, according to her official Web site, which announced her death Monday. She worked as a secretary for Anne Frank's father, Otto, in the front side of the same Prinsengracht building. The family stayed in the secret room from July 1942 until August 4, 1944, when they were arrested by Gestapo and Dutch police after being betrayed by an informant. Two of Gies' team were arrested that day, but she and her friend, Bep Voskuijl, were left behind -- and found 14-year-old Anne's papers. ""And there Bep and I saw Anne's diary papers lying on the floor. I said, 'Pick them up!' Bep stood there staring, frozen. I said, 'Pick them up! Pick them up!' We were afraid, but we did out best to collect all the papers,"" Gies said in a 1998 interview with The Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. ""Then we went downstairs. And there we stood, Bep and I. I asked, 'What now, Bep?' She answered, 'You're the oldest. You hold on to them. So I did."" The girl had chronicled two years of the emotions and fears that gripped her during hiding, as well as candid thoughts on her family, her feelings for friend-in-hiding Peter van Pels, and dreams of being a professional writer. Mixed into the entries were the names of the Dutch helpers, who risked their lives to keep the family's secret. ""I didn't read Anne's diary papers. ... It's a good thing I didn't because if I had read them I would have had to burn them,"" she said in the 1998 interview. ""Some of the information in them was dangerous."" The diary was sheltered in Gies' desk drawer and later turned over to Otto Frank when he returned after the war as the only surviving resident of the annex. Anne died at northern Germany's Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Her father published her diary, titled ""The Secret Annex,"" in 1947. Despite the legendary hardship she endured during the German occupation, Gies never embraced the label of a hero. ""More than 20,000 Dutch people helped to hide Jews and others in need of hiding during those years. I willingly did what I could to help. My husband did as well. It was not enough,"" she says in the prologue of her memoirs, ""Anne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped to Hide the Frank Family."" ""There is nothing special about me. I have never wanted special attention. I was only willing to do what was asked of me and what seemed necessary at the time."" Gies' husband, Jan, whom she married in 1941, died in 1993. The couple had a son together.","Gies helped hide Anne Frank, seven others from Nazis in Amsterdam .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The Hong Kong government has scrapped plans to introduce a mandatory Chinese civic education subject critics had slammed as pro-mainland propaganda. The decision came on the eve of local elections and after a series of protests including a 10-day hunger strike on the steps of the government headquarters. C.Y. Leung, the city's chief executive, announced Saturday that individual schools would have the option to adopt the controversial curriculum called ""Moral and National Education."" Hong Kong school year starts with hunger strikes . ""We're giving the authority to the schools,"" he said. ""This is very much in line with our school-based education policy."" A coalition of concern group had protested against the subject which they said amounted to ""brainwashing"" impressionable young minds with pro-mainland Chinese propaganda. The course material had been outlined in a government booklet called ""The China Model,"" which was distributed to schools in July. China's ruling party is ""progressive, selfless and united,"" the booklet said. It criticized multi-party systems as bringing disaster to countries such as the United States. The booklet also makes no mention of major events that many view as integral to China's history, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Hong Kong has a large degree of autonomy from the Beijing government as part of the agreement made with Britain after the 1997 transfer of power. TIME: Hong Kong's new leader is divisive figure . Despite the administrative separation from China, Hong Kong's 7 million residents are not allowed to vote for the territory's leadership. That role is filled by a chief executive appointed by a small group of specially -selected influential people. However, the territory's leadership has made moves toward introducing universal suffrage, and on Sunday millions are eligible to vote for 40 seats in the 70-member Legislative Council. The remainder will be appointed by a small group of electors. Leung has denied the government back-down on national education was timed to avoid a voter backlash in Sunday's election, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP). ""If it hadn't been for the decision of the last administration, national education would not have been on the agenda of this government,"" Leung said. ""I would rather concentrate on housing, poverty and other livelihood issues. I've held numerous talks with the chief secretary on major policymaking, [and] none of our conversations ever touched on national education,"" he added, according to the SCMP. Saturday's back down follows a number of major protests, the most recent of which was on Saturday when an estimated 100,000 protesters gathered outside government headquarters, according to organizers.

"(CNN) -- The pilot or pilots aboard an unresponsive plane that flew from the United States over the Caribbean Sea on Friday may have been stricken by cerebral hypoxia -- a fancy term for when your brain is deprived of oxygen. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled fighter jets to check on the plane and suggested on Twitter that hypoxia may be to blame. Before the small plane's windows frosted, fighter pilots tracking the plane could see a pilot slumped over, a NORAD official said. Cerebral hypoxia can happen to pilots if they reach too high of an altitude or if there is a loss in cabin pressure. It can also be the result of carbon monoxide poisoning or breathing in too much smoke from a fire. There is a progressive reduction of oxygen per breath the higher the altitude. Every pilot's reaction to hypoxia is different, according to a the Federal Aviation Administration. But is extremely hard for a person to tell when it is happening to them because the onset of symptoms is subtle. In the beginning, pilots may experience an increase in the rate at which they breathe. They also may feel lightheaded or dizzy. Eventually, they will start to lose coordination. They will experience tunnel vision and their judgment would become impaired. Brain cells are particularly vulnerable to a lack of oxygen. Without it they can die off and cause permanent brain damage. When a brain goes without oxygen for too long, the part of the brain that helps with breathing can stop working and can keep you from breathing. Federal investigators believe golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet went down in 1999 after his plane lost cabin pressure during its flight. In that case, a low-pressure alarm could be heard on the cockpit voice recorder recovered from the wreckage. The FAA said his plane climbed as high as 51,000 feet. The human body has limited ability to function above 10,000 feet without additional oxygen.","Cerebral hypoxia can be caused by flying at too high an altitude .

"(CNN) -- An Idaho man who admitted trying to assassinate President Barack Obama by shooting at the White House received a 25-year prison sentence on Monday. Oscar Ortega-Hernandez, 23, appeared in federal court after pleading guilty in September to terrorism and weapons charges. He had been originally indicted on 17 criminal counts. Prosecutors had charged Ortega-Hernandez with firing a Romanian-made assault rifle out of the window of his car the evening of November 11, 2011. After sending a number of rounds toward the White House, he sped away toward a bridge leading to the Virginia suburbs, but crashed his vehicle and fled on foot, officials said. The government said Ortega-Hernandez's fingerprints were found on ammunition magazines left in a 1998 Honda, but not on the weapon itself, which also was left in the car. Neither the President nor his family were at home at the time of the incident. ""This man drove cross-country to launch an assault rifle attack on the White House from Constitution Avenue,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, whose office prosecuted the case. ""He was motivated by hatred for the President and the desire to start a revolution against the federal government. ""We are very fortunate that his bullets narrowly missed the U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House that night. This 25-year prison sentence demonstrates that anyone who comes to the nation's capital planning to use violence should expect to spend decades behind bars."" Ortega-Hernandez was captured at a Pennsylvania motel five days after the incident. In court documents, prosecutors argued Ortega-Hernandez was dangerous and planned out his alleged crime over a period of months. According to the FBI, Ortega-Hernandez's friends reported that he made anti-government statements beginning in 2010. Officials said he believed the federal government was trying to control Americans through GPS, fluoride and aspartame. He was also angry at what he believed was U.S. bullying of other countries, including in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and claimed that the President was the ""anti-Christ"" and told friends he was ""on a mission from God to take out Obama.""","Idaho man admitted that he wanted to kill the President .

"(CNN) -- Some people are wondering about the capability of the Secret Service after it was revealed that Omar Gonzalez, the fence jumper who breached White House security two weeks ago, made it much farther into the house than previously reported, running through the first floor before he was apprehended outside the Green Room. The details of Gonzalez's intrusion, coupled with a new report on Tuesday that an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with the President on a recent trip to the Centers for Disease Control, plus a report that it took the Secret Service four days to learn that seven bullets had hit the White House's residence area in 2011 and a string of other blunders in recent years (such as a couple crashing a state dinner and a prostitution scandal in Colombia), have put the Secret Service under a harsh light. The problems plaguing the Secret Service go beyond PR embarrassments, and changes seem inevitable. But despite the cries of reform, significant alterations to the way the agency functions will be difficult and ultimately may not even be known to the public. A change at the top . Secret Service Director Julia Pierson's future is uncertain. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama has confidence in Pierson, whom he appointed in 2013. But the fervor surrounding this incident doesn't bode well for Pierson, the agency's first female director. ""When you lie, and when you obfuscate and when you cover up, especially in the 21st century, that's an offense you can't walk back from,"" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University and a Secret Service expert. ""That's really the kiss of death for any leader."" How much blame Pierson actually deserves is entirely unknown, and the replacement of an agency head -- though often necessary because of optics -- is sometimes purely that: It doesn't always bring about change. ""It's basically impossible that agencies are so entrenched and so enmeshed in their own long-term culture that any change in personnel at the top is merely about symbolism,"" Engel said. ""It's unlikely in the short term to make any significant impact in how the agency operates."" Obama appointed Pierson as Secret Service director after her predecessor, Mark Sullivan, retired in early 2013. Sullivan's departure came in the wake of another scandal -- when several male agents on a presidential trip in Cartagena, Colombia, took prostitutes back to their hotel rooms -- that rocked the agency nearly a year earlier. Secret Service beefs up presence after 2 White House security incidents . Obstacles to change . Though its director is appointed directly by the president, the Secret Service is not its own government department. It has been a branch of the Department of Homeland Security since March 1, 2003, shortly after that department was established. Previously, the Secret Service had been part of the Treasury Department but was moved to streamline the various security measures around the president, the vice president and their families. ""The entire purpose of moving their institutional affiliation after the reforms, after 9/11, was in order to allow them to focus on their core mission: to protect the president,"" Engel said. ""This was supposed to streamline that and supposed to help with actual physical security issues."" Change in large bureaucratic structure at agencies such as Homeland Security (or even Treasury) is typically difficult and moves very slowly. Plus, the agency did not escape budget cuts in 2013. There may also be a cultural roadblock to potential reform. ""The Secret Service has the attitude of 'we make do with less; we can take care of any problem,' "" said investigative journalist Ron Kessler, a critic of the Secret Service who wrote about some of the details in the 2011 White House shooting in his book ""The First Family Detail."" The good news is that the Secret Service, which is highly selective, is much smaller than most government agencies, so change could be a bit easier. Secrecy factor . The Secret Service has two missions: protecting the president, the vice president and their respective families, plus past presidents and presidential candidates, and investigating crimes including identity theft, counterfeiting and computer fraud. The protection responsibility is the more recognized of the two and the task that received the majority of the agency's nearly $1.6 billion budget in 2014: $920 million of that total allotment went to protection costs. Because of the nature of its mission, many of the agency's protocols are secret. ""They assiduously don't want their protocols available for the public to discuss,"" Engel said. Even some changes in customs brought about by these incidents might not be publicly revealed. A strong record . Recent incidents aside, the Secret Service, which has been protecting American presidents since 1906, still boasts a generally impressive record. Hundreds of fence jumpers have been apprehended immediately, thousands of presidential trips have gone off without a hitch domestically and overseas, an untold number of threats have been neutralized, and there's been an ability to keep up with ever-evolving technology that poses new dangers.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- As violence continues to wrack Iraq, the United Nations warned Saturday of another ethnic slaughter in the making by Sunni extremists from ISIS. ISIS fighters have besieged the ethnic Turkmen Shiite town of Amerli in the north for two months, and its fewer than 20,000 residents are without power and running out of food, water and medical supplies. ""The situation of the people in Amerli is desperate and demands immediate action to prevent the possible massacre of its citizens,"" said Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Iraq. He said the suffering was ""unspeakable"" and demanded that the Shiite majority Iraqi government ""relieve the siege"" on Amerli. The religious group's head cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, pushed the government to do the same Friday. And he called for air drops ""to ease the suffering of its people, especially children and the weak."" About 5,000 families live in Amerli, which has been under siege for 70 days, according to Dr. Ali Albayati, head of the Turkmen Saving Foundation. He told CNN the town is running without electricity, is out of medicine and can only turn to wells for water. Nearly three dozen villages surrounding Amerli are already under ISIS control, Albayati said. The people of Amerli are relying on the Iraqi government to take them out by helicopter or support them with food drops, Albayati said. In the past 10 days, he added, only one flight has delivered food. Surrounded on four sides, the 17,400 residents have had to defend themselves with only the help of local police, said Masrwr Aswad of Iraq's Human Rights Commission. He said attempts to bring aid have been hampered by the ISIS security threat, which makes flying helicopters into the area extremely difficult and dangerous. Their situation echoes the ordeal of Iraq's ethnic Yazidis, whose plight after they were forced to flee into the mountains to escape militants ISIS triggered U.S. aid drops and the first U.S. airstrikes against ISIS. Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi praised the people of Amerli for their ""heroic defense"" in the face of the ISIS siege and called for them to be given support. Their resistance represents ""the beginning of the demise"" of ISIS, he said, saying it could encourage other communities also to stand up against the militants. ISIS has targeted Shiite, Christian and other minority communities as it has advanced across Iraq. Yazidis braced for life in exile . Baghdad, Kirkuk and Irbil bombings . Meanwhile, a suicide bomber targeted the Interior Ministry intelligence headquarters in central Baghdad on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring 35 others. The attacker drove up to the complex gate and detonated the explosives, local police officials said. They warned that the casualty figures are expected to rise. In Kirkuk, a series of three car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded in close succession in different areas of the volatile city, killing at least 20 people and wounding 113 others, Kirkuk police officials told CNN. This follows a warning issued by ISIS on Friday promising revenge after the killing of 50 of its members in a battle in Jalawla, Iraq. ISIS specifically promised to retaliate against the Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Two of the three car bombs appeared to target a construction site where Kurdish Pershmerga and Asayesh (Kurdish intelligence) forces were stationed at a security post. Another car bomb detonated in Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region, Kurdish government officials confirmed to CNN. It was the first explosion in the city since a suicide bomber targeted the security headquarters there in September 2013. The car bomb exploded on the outskirts of the city, on the side of a main road leading out of Irbil to Kirkuk. Kurdish officials said at least two people were injured, and the local television network Rudaw reported from the scene that three people light injuries. This string of incidents came as the death toll death rose to 70 from an attack on Sunni Muslims a day earlier at a mosque in northeast Iraq, when suspected Shiite militiamen opened fire on worshipers. Friday's attack in the Musab bin Omar Mosque in the village of Bani Weis, about 50 miles northeast of Baquba, also injured at least 17 people, officials said. It also threatened to derail efforts to form a new, inclusive government -- something world leaders have said is a must if the country hopes to defeat Islamic militants. Iraqi authorities did not immediately identify the attackers, but Sunni politicians have put the blame on Shiite militias. Outraged Sunni lawmakers withdrew from negotiations to form a new government, saying they would not return until those behind the attack were arrested, two party officials told CNN. But the United States and the United Nations called on Iraq to continue its efforts to form a united government. U.S. 'understands the threat' U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized targeted airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq -- including military advisers -- as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS. And U.S. officials have said that Washington is mulling the possibility of going after ISIS fighters in their stronghold in eastern Syria. But Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby would not confirm concrete plans. ""We don't telegraph our punches,"" he said. ""I'm not going to get ahead of planning that hasn't been done or decisions that haven't been made,"" Kirby said. What will it take to beat ISIS? ISIS vows retribution for killings . ISIS made threats over battle losses on Friday. More than 50 of its fighters were killed while defending the large ISIS-held town of Jalawla ""against the Peshmerga (Kurdish) mercenaries,"" it said on Twitter. A subsequent tweet said the group vowed revenge. Iraqi and Kurdish forces surrounded Jalawla and took back several nearby villages in Diyala province, a spokesman for Kurdish forces said. The Peshmerga and Iraqi commandos inflicted heavy losses against ISIS in those battles, military officials said. In neighboring Salaheddin province, also north of Baghdad, Iraqi helicopters killed 30 ISIS fighters in the town of Dhuluiya, about 70 kilometers northeast of Baquba, Iraqi security officials told CNN. More U.S. airstrikes near Mosul Dam . Meanwhile, U.S. military forces have conducted more airstrikes against the militants, primarily ISIS-driven vehicles, near Mosul Dam, the Pentagon said. Since August 8, the U.S. military has carried out 94 airstrikes, 61 of them in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam, according to the Defense Department. The dam is the largest in the country, and Iraqi and U.S. officials fear that a breach in the dam would threaten the lives of millions of Iraqis who live downstream in Mosul and Baghdad. The U.S. airstrikes have continued despite a threat by ISIS to kill another American hostage. Earlier this week, ISIS posted an online video showing the execution of American journalist James Foley. The group threatened the life of another man, identified as American journalist Steven Sotloff, if the United States didn't end airstrikes in Iraq. Where is ISIS?

"RICHLAND HILLS, Texas (CNN) -- The machines are buzzing as dozens of workers package freshly made surgical masks. More than 1 million will be made in one day inside Prestige Ameritech's manufacturing facility near Fort Worth, Texas. Prestige Ameritech in Texas will be making surgical masks around the clock because of the swine flu outbreak. The swine flu outbreak has made this small company a big deal. ""Everyone knows who we are now,"" said Mike Bowen, executive vice president of the surgical mask manufacturer. ""It's actually been pretty crazy."" Prestige Ameritech is ramping up production. For the first time in the company's history, it will be manufacturing masks 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Bowen also is looking to hire up to 20 workers to handle the workload. Ever since Bowen and his business partner, Dan Reese, showed up to work Monday morning, the phones haven't stopped ringing. With the World Health Organization and national governments confirming cases of swine flu in at least 11 countries, orders for masks are coming in from around the world. ""We're still trying to get a handle on everything,"" Bowen said. Prestige Ameritech is the only surgical mask manufacturing company in the United States. Most surgical masks are made in Mexico and China. The company, with a workforce of 80 people, makes masks for major distributors, like 3M, who sell the masks to hospitals and doctors across the country. Health care suppliers say if the swine flu outbreak becomes a pandemic, it could severely strain hospitals' efforts to get necessary equipment like masks, gloves and antibiotics. ""What this situation should teach us is that we need to take a critical look at where we source pandemic supplies and in what quantities,"" said Mike Alkire, president of Purchasing Partners for Premier Inc., a North Carolina-based healthcare improvement alliance with a division that negotiates supply contracts for its more than 2,100 member hospitals. ""We feel that they are in good shape overall, provided the disease doesn't overwhelm our current resources or spread to a large number of additional communities,"" Alkire said. With Prestige Ameritech operating at capacity, Bowen worries that a pandemic would create a surgical mask shortage in the United States. The first cases of swine flu in humans were detected in Mexico, where health officials suspect the virus in more than 150 deaths. Scenes of Mexican citizens walking city streets with masks are playing out daily. The Mexican government has handed out masks to the public. Bowen says the United States is not equipped to handle that kind of demand.  Learn about swine flu and how to treat it » . ""Surgical masks are used in hospitals. They're not used in the general public,"" Bowen said. ""So when the general public starts wanting face masks, the supply gets short really quickly."" He added: ""If there's a pandemic, America won't be able to supply its own needs, because we're pretty much it."" Bowen said that if the situation gets worse worldwide, countries like China and Mexico would keep surgical masks for their own citizens. He said he wants to make sure the surgical masks are going to health care professionals and not brokers looking to take financial advantage of this health scare. The shortage of American surgical-mask manufacturers is a critical weakness in the country's ability to battle a pandemic outbreak, he said. ""Hopefully, this isn't the big one,"" Bowen said. ""What we're hoping is that this is just a wake-up call.""","""Everyone knows who we are now,"" company's executive vice president says .

"Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN) -- A U.S. lawmaker is calling for the arming of Ukrainian forces engaged in fighting Russian troops along the nation's eastern border with Russia. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, is in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on a fact-finding mission into the monthslong conflict there between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military. Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Menendez called this a ""watershed moment"" in the conflict. He said it's time to recognize what's really happening in eastern Ukraine -- not a rebel uprising, but a Russian invasion. ""And we must recognize it as that,"" said Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""When I read the headlines back at home that suggest rebels are advancing in different parts of eastern Ukraine, it's not rebels -- it's Russian soldiers."" ""We should be providing the Ukrainians with the type of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon (Russian President Vladimir) Putin for further aggression."" U.S. President Barack Obama has opposed supplying Ukraine with weapons in the past, but Menendez said he believes the Obama administration should re-examine what he calls changed circumstances there. ""I think the European Union, NATO, as well as the United States has to consider this is dramatically different and we have to give the Ukrainians the fighting chance to defend themselves. I'm not suggesting U.S. troops here or NATO troops here ... but I am suggesting that the Ukrainians have the wherewithal to fight for themselves. "" Poroshenko warns of looming war with Russia . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko warned Saturday that his nation's crisis with Russia has worsened in recent days and is inching closer to a ""full-scale war."" ""I think we are very close to the point of no return,"" Poroshenko said following an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium. ""The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened in the territory controlled by separatists and where -- instead of separatists -- there are regular Russian troops."" Poroshenko said thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory. Russia has repeatedly denied supporting the rebels or sending troops over the border. But the West has rejected Moscow's denials. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, speaking at a meeting in Brussels, said new sanctions are in the works for Russia. ""The European Council says that it stands ready to take further significant steps in the light of the evolution of the situation on the ground and it requests the commission to urgently undertake preparatory work ... and present proposals for consideration within a week,"" Rompuy said. As condemnation from the West escalated, Putin was defiant. Moscow doesn't want or intend to wade into any ""large-scale conflicts,"" Putin said, according to state-run ITAR-Tass. A few breaths later, he said Russia is ""strengthening our nuclear deterrence forces and our armed forces,"" making them more efficient and modernized. ""I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations,"" Putin said. ""This is a reality, not just words."" Ukrainian port city fortifies defenses . The Ukrainian military worked to fortify the port city of Mariupol after Russian intelligence groups were observed there, said Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Defense and Security Council. A CNN team saw Ukrainian forces strengthening defensive positions on the eastern outskirts of the city, reinforcing checkpoints and digging trenches along roads leading toward the Russian border. Beyond these checkpoints, the team found a small advance detachment of Ukrainian troops on the main road about halfway between Mariupol and Novoazovsk. Months of violence leads to thousands of deaths . Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March, following the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych the previous month. Violence broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April, as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Since mid-April, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations. UNREST MAPPED: A divided Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- Packaging can change how people see things. And when it comes to sex, it could maybe help save lives too. The Center for African Family Studies (CAFS), a Nairobi-based international NGO, has teamed up with Kenyan artist Michael Soi to create an eye-catching condom line with pop art-inspired packaging to promote safe sex and raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. The group has turned to crowdsourcing website Indiegogo to raise funds for its campaign, which aims to encourage condom usage among local youth in a country where an estimated 1.6 million people struggle with HIV/AIDS. ""They were giving out free condoms when I went to the HIV conference in Cape Town recently,"" says CAFS director of operations Jonathan Spangler. ""These condoms were brightly colored, like nothing seen in Kenya -- glow in the dark, different flavors, different prints. We put a picture of them on Facebook and we had youth calling us up asking where they could purchase them,"" he adds. ""We've never had that sort of reaction to CAFS programs. So we said why don't we try produce our own condom line because there seems to be a market. We want to innovate and create new programming that is sustainable and even generates income for the youth,"" he adds.. Stigma vs. safety . HIV/AIDS continues to be one of the most prominent public health obstacles many African countries face today. In recent years, the disease -- which had reached epidemic proportions -- has started to decline in Kenya as a result of stronger public awareness campaigns and the impact of local education programs. While the outlook is positive, campaigners say more needs to be done to continue to reduce the threat of HIV/AIDS in the country -- a start could be made by tackling the stigma surrounding the purchase of condoms. ""Most people are actually very afraid of going to vendors in supermarkets and chemists to buy condoms because we are a fairly reserved society,"" explains Genevieve Imbali, communications and marketing officer at CAFS. ""Most people aren't very open to the idea that very young people might walk into a shop just to buy condoms because nobody wants to be known to be having sex ... There is so much stigma associated with condom purchase in the country."" Eye-catching designs . To address this, the bright packaging of CAFS' colored condoms is specifically designed to disguise the product inside. Imbali explains that by making condoms less obvious, more people will be willing to buy them. She also says that the condoms currently available in the country are either too expensive or low quality -- issues, she claims, will be tackled with the CAFS condom line. ""For the condoms that are given out for free at schools, the youth still do not take them,"" argues Imbali. ""They look at them and think: 'You know what, you are giving this for free but they are not good quality.' So they'd probably just have unprotected sex rather than use the ones that are easily accessible."" Collaborating with artists . But getting an artist to agree to provide designs for the packaging became a struggle. Many didn't want their work associated with sex and CAFS hit a roadblock -- until they met with Michael Soi. The Nairobi-based artist is well-known for his bold, but often controversial, themes placed within his paintings. Unafraid to shy away from taboo subjects like sex and interracial relationships, Soi was more than happy to collaborate with the NGO. ""I felt like everybody is basically trying to deal with this whole issue -- HIV, unwanted pregnancies -- and when I talk about everybody I mean the church is doing whatever they can, the government is doing whatever they can,"" says Soi. ""I felt the project was a good thing. I wanted to try to chip in and create something that would help fight a good fight,"" he says. Soi explains that sex isn't discussed openly and that as a result many young people learn about the dangers of unprotected sex the hard way -- through experience. However, he does believe awareness is increasing and he hopes his work will continue to change attitudes surrounding sex in Kenya. ""I think it's important to try and play a part and make sure that people will not go through the same mistakes as what my generation has gone through.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least eight people were wounded Saturday in the Iraqi city of Samarra during clashes between security forces and angry mourners accompanying the caskets of two people killed in protests the day before, according to local police. Also, two protesters critically wounded in Friday protests in Tikrit died on Saturday, police said. And a teenaged boy died Friday night during protests in Kubaisa, in Anbar province, police said Saturday. With those deaths, the number of those reported killed in protests across the country rose to 13, according to official accounts. Since early February, thousands of protesters have participated in a series of demonstrations across the country, apparently inspired by popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. Their protests are against corruption, restrictions on freedom of expression, unemployment and poor government services. In Saturday's incident in Samarra, protesters defied curfew to attend the funerals of two people killed during protests there, chanting ""God is great"" and ""Down with the government."" Security forces battled some of the protesters and later opened fire to disperse the crowd, wounding at least eight, police said. The death in Kubaisa, a small town about 140 kilometers west of Baghdad, came after security forces opened fire to disperse protesters late Friday night.  Later, demonstrators attacked the city council building and set it on fire, police said. Two protesters critically injured during Friday protests in the Iraqi city of Tikrit died on Saturday, according to police there, bringing to four the number of people who died as the result of clashes with security forces. In Basra, mourners also held a funeral procession Saturday for a protester killed the day before. Ali Ghaim al-Maliki, the head of Basra's security council, told reporters Saturday that at least 71 people were wounded in Friday's clashes -- including 51 security forces and 20 anti-government protesters. Most of the injuries in the city, located about 550 kilometers (342 miles) south of Baghdad, occurred during fighting with stones and batons, he said. In several cities, police said security forces fired at crowds of protesters to disperse them. In Tikrit, police said two protesters were killed and 17 others were wounded during the clashes. In Samarra, two people were killed and seven protesters were injured, police said. Police said five other demonstrators were killed in the cities of Mosul and Hawijah. Unrest also flared in Baghdad, Falluja, Ramadi and in two towns in the province of Salaheddin. In a statement released Friday, Human Rights Watch called on Iraqi authorities to investigate the deaths of demonstrators. ""The Iraqi authorities need to rein in their security forces and account for every single killing,"" said Tom Porteous, the organization's deputy program director. ""The security forces need to use the maximum possible restraint in dealing with protesters."" The country's defense ministry has not issued a response to the reported deaths. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki had urged citizens not to participate in Friday's planned massive protests, claiming former members of Saddam Hussein's regime and terrorists were plotting to take advantage of the demonstrations to create chaos in the country. The Iraqi government was formed in December, nine months after an inconclusive national election. This is the second elected government in the nearly eight years after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Hussein.","NEW:Eight people are wounded during funerals for two killed in Samarra the day before .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- This is the story of two entrepreneurs with two very different interests. One thing they have in common: Both took major risks and started a business in the middle of the global financial crisis. What was the motivation? For Mike Haskamp, January 2009 was a low point. He was laid off and divorced that month. He had been an investment banker for Lehman Brothers, whose bankruptcy in September 2008 catalyzed the financial crisis. He was only 30. This was not supposed to happen to a Harvard grad armed with an MBA from Columbia. ""I started interviewing for jobs at private equity firms and five weeks into it, I realized I wasn't really in love with the job or the industry anymore,"" Haskamp says. So he did what most entrepreneurs do. He networked with friends, brainstormed and came up with a business idea that embraced his passion: martial arts. Haskamp, who grew up in Macau and Hong Kong, has practiced martial arts his whole life. He wanted to start a mixed martial arts company in Asia for Asian-Pacific fighters. He and a friend Chris Pollak, who was ready to leave his job at McKinsey Consulting, sold all their possessions, put up their own seed capital and set up the business. Legend Fighting Championship was born in July 2009. ""We saw that Asia was doing better than the rest of the world, looking to recover faster and we saw that trends in entertainment, the growth of the middle class, the deregulation of media. Those all sort of pointed in my mind to a much more favorable environment than ever before to start a sports media-oriented business,"" Haskamp says. Two and a half years later, Legend has carved a niche for itself in the mixed martial arts world. They will put on their eighth major championship at the end of March in Jakarta. Initially, their revenues came from ticket sales. Today, it's a combination of television licensing, sponsorships, ad sales and ticket sales. China is their biggest revenue market followed by Indonesia and Australia. Haskamp says he sees a surge of interest in the Philippines, Malaysia and India. Taking the Risk . Maximilian von Poelnitz found a problem and started a business to solve it. After living in Hong Kong for four years, the 27-year-old discovered it was difficult to find good quality food - especially meat - at affordable prices. He had worked in corporate real estate for CB Richard Ellis but was getting the itch to start his own business. He and two friends came up with the concept for Secret Ingredient, a delivery service of fresh ingredients for ready-to-cook dishes with the cooking instructions included. One selling point is all the meats and fish are imported from Australia and New Zealand. They pooled their own money together for $100,000 to start up the business. They rented an old print shop, converted it into a test kitchen and spent several months trying out different recipes. ""The success of our business depends on logistics,"" von Poelnitz says. That means figuring out how to deliver the meals during crunch dinner time in a busy city like Hong Kong. Secret Ingredient uses couriers on foot, vans and mopeds. After about 250 test meals -- mostly with friends -- Secret Ingredient launched last fall in Hong Kong. Since then, Von Poelnitz says the young business is close to serving its 1000th meal. One regular client is Petrina Vos, a vice president of human resources at Blackrock. ""I work really long hours from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. It's the time question for me ... the price point is really reasonable,"" she says. ""My meals average HK$250 (US$ 32) for two people. I think that's good for the quality of food, ease and time it saves you."" Both Legend and Secret Ingredient started in a period of global economic fragility. What made Haskamp believe investors would buy into the niche idea of setting up mixed martial arts fights and that the public would pay good money to see a fight? ""Economies go through cycles and if you're always waiting for the perfect time to do something then you might miss the opportunity,"" Haskamp explains. Von Poelnitz says, ""I think in our case, the timing and all the chips kind of fell into place. It was less the macro (situation) and more the timing of our individual lives that made it work."" His two partners bring different skills to the table. One is a former lawyer and the other is a chef who used to run a private kitchen in Hong Kong. Lessons Learned . Both businesses benefited from running a lean business from the start. Legend started out in Haskamp's small Hong Kong apartment. ""We paid an intern to work from our dining room table,"" Haskamp said. In order to decide which fighters to invite to championships, Haskamp and his partner do their initial research by watching fight videos on the internet. Then they fly to the fighter's home country to meet and hammer out individual contracts. Between Secret Ingredient's three co-founders, they have a large social network of friends to spread the word. ""We don't have very much of an advertising budget,"" says von Poelnitz. They utilize Twitter and have dabbled in Facebook advertising. They've also bartered with friends in public relations: free meals for free PR.. One unexpected lesson for Secret Ingredient was realizing the timing of their launch was not ideal. They opened for business a few months before Christmas and Lunar New Year when many new customers leave Hong Kong for the holidays. ""Being in the food business, holidays are your big enemy which seems counterintuitive,"" says von Poelnitz. Neither Legend nor Secret Ingredient will say whether they're profitable or breaking even at the moment. The one thing the founders will say is they're glad they went against conventional thinking and took the plunge. ""I knew this was a good idea. I trusted my partner. I trusted myself and ultimately, I think it's paid off,"" says Haskamp.","Mike Haskamp started his own business the month he was laid off and divorced .

"New York (CNN) -- Prosecutors dropped charges Wednesday against one of two men arrested in connection with an attack over the weekend on an SUV driver who was swarmed by bikers on a New York City street. ""We are taking Sunday's crimes extremely seriously, and will proceed with charges in a manner that enables us to build the strongest cases possible,"" said Karen Friedman-Agnifilo, the prosecutor who is overseeing the case. Charges against motorcyclist Allen Edwards were dropped. The 42-year-old biker had originally faced charges of reckless endangerment, criminal mischief and menacing, the New York City Police Department said. But that didn't mean the prosecutors were done. ""Prematurely charging individuals with low-level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation, and could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of serious crimes,"" said Friedman-Agnifilo said in a statement. ""After we investigate the facts and each person's individual actions, we will know what charges can be supported by the evidence. There is still a tremendous amount of investigation to be done."" The NYPD released images and asked for the public's help in identifying and locating suspects wanted in connection with the attack. The incident has drawn attention because much of it was captured in a video that shows Edwards just before the alleged assault. Edwards is one of the bikers seen pounding on the windows of a Range Rover after it was forced to stop in traffic following a chase by bikers -- an account confirmed by a police official. Edwards may have been trying to protect the driver of the SUV who had come under attack, according to one witness, a law enforcement official said. If so, that may not be obvious in the video, which appears to have been shot by a biker, because it ends before the driver of the SUV is dragged from the vehicle, which also held his wife and 2-year-old daughter. Edwards, who surrendered to police, is cooperating with authorities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Police have said the SUV driver, identified by a source with knowledge of the incident as businessman Alexian Lien, initially called 911 on Sunday afternoon to report that bikers were driving erratically on the West Side Highway. Police say Lien sped off after allegedly accidentally hitting one biker, Christopher Cruz, who had moved in front of his SUV and then slowed. Cruz, 28, was in court Wednesday facing misdemeanor charges, including reckless driving. Cruz's attorney told reporters that his client is not guilty. Cruz was to be released after posting $1,500 cash bail and a $15,000 insurance bond. In addition, his license was suspended and he was ordered to surrender his passport. ""His motorcycle was struck and he stood right there. He never assaulted this man, he never tried to assault him in any way, and he does not know any of the other motorcyclists who were involved in this beating,"" attorney H. Benjamin Perez told reporters. Jerome Davis witnessed a part of the confrontation between the motorcyclists and the driver, who he described as a ""maniac."" ""If something happens, you stop right there. It's an accident. You think and stop. You don't keep reacting on,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett. Investigators say Lien told them he feared for his life when bikers surrounded his vehicle, pounding on it and slashing his tires. He stepped on the gas and hit three more bikers, injuring one of them -- Edwin Mieses -- critically. ""All of his ribs are fractured,"" Mieses' mother, Yolanda Santiago, told WBZ, ""his lungs are so badly bruised that he's still on a ventilator."" Mieses' wife said he had been trying to help the first biker who was initially hit by the SUV when he, too, was hit. His family has said he is paralyzed and in a coma. Police said the biker group, called ""Hollywood Stuntz,"" chased the driver, whose flat tires forced him to stop. Cornered, Lien was beaten, police said. He was treated at a hospital for slashes to his face and released. Neither his wife nor his child was hurt. CNN's Elizabeth Landers and Lawrence Crook III contributed to this report.","NEW: NYPD asks for the public's help in identifying, locating suspects .

"(CNN) -- The Department of Energy is putting federal money behind the development of small-scale nuclear reactors that supporters say are cheaper, safer and easier to build, though the design still needs federal approval. The first award under a $452 million program to boost the development of small modular reactors will go to a consortium led by Babcock & Wilcox and the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Southeastern utility that already operates three commercial nuclear plants. The reactors will be about a third the size of those now used in nuclear power plants, with the B&W design generating about 180 megawatts of electricity -- enough to power almost 200,000 homes. However, industry skeptics say the economics and the safety of the concept remain untested. The total amount of the award has yet to be calculated, but the government will pay up to half the project cost and will work with the companies to get the new reactors licensed and operating within 10 years, the Energy Department said. ""Restarting the nation's nuclear industry and advancing small modular reactor technologies will help create new jobs and export opportunities for American workers and businesses, and ensure we continue to take an all-of-the-above approach to American energy production,"" Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement announcing Tuesday's decision. Unlike current designs, the units -- shorthanded as SMRs -- are designed to be installed underground instead of being located inside towering concrete buildings. They could run longer on the same nuclear fuel, and additional reactors could be added in a ""plug and play"" fashion, said Paul Genoa of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade association. ""You don't have to build a 1,000- or 1,500-megawatt power plant and hope that demand catches up,"" said Genoa, the NEI's senior director of policy development. ""You can build chunks of power to more closely meet your demand curve."" Nuclear plants provide about 20% of the U.S. electric power supply, but most of the 104 operating reactors date back to the 1960s and '70s. The Obama administration has supported the construction of the first new reactors since the 1979 partial meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island plant, providing $8 billion in federal support for two nuclear power plants in Georgia. The industry and the Energy Department say that would make SMRs a good choice for small utilities. But the designs are still under review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, whose approval is the worldwide ""gold seal,"" Genoa said. The NRC launched a widespread review of U.S. nuclear safety after the meltdowns at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011 caused by that nation's devastating tsunami. Genoa said safety and security recommendations issued after that disaster -- and after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on New York and Washington -- are being included ""from the ground up."" Japan's nuclear fight intensifies . Placing the reactors underground would make them less vulnerable to the shaking from earthquakes, and the surrounding earth would absorb much of the heat released if an accident occurred, Genoa said. The new designs are ""orders of magnitude safer"" than existing plants, ""and we believe those plants are safe,"" he said. But Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the advantages touted by the industry -- smaller facilities and fewer workers -- could be ""invitations to disaster."" ""What Fukushima has shown us is that existing nuclear power plants don't have the personnel or resources to cope with severe emergencies,"" said Lyman, a physicist and senior scientist with the watchdog group. In addition, the modular design could make it more difficult to inspect and maintain key components, many of which would be located within the pressure vessel at the heart of the reactor, he said. Lyman also questioned claims that about the cost advantages of the smaller reactors, noting that the boom in natural gas is squeezing even established nuclear utilities. ""The SMRs are without a doubt going to be more expensive than even large reactors,"" he said. ""Their economics are only getting worse."" Genoa acknowledged that some design issues ""cut both ways,"" and that the first companies to adopt the new technology will incur higher costs. But he said the experience of other industries, such as aerospace or the U.S. nuclear submarine program, shows costs can drop significantly over the life of a program. ""It's important to understand that these designs are in the early stage -- at best 20% to 30% complete,"" he said.","The Energy Department announces support for small modular reactor design .

"(CNN) -- There's something lurking in the depths of Loch Ness, Scotland and it has nothing to do with monsters. Footage from the Loch Ness submarine search showing two golf balls submerged in silt. On a recent expedition to try and find evidence of the Loch Ness monster, U.S. research teams came across something quite unexpected -- not a prehistoric creature of the deep but thousands of plastic covered golf balls. Mike O'Brien of SeaTrepid explains: ""At first we thought they were mushrooms, there were so many. But when we lowered the camera, we were surprised to see that they were in fact, golf balls."" The smattering of balls were found roughly 300 yards from the beach and 100 yards from the shore where it is thought locals and visitors have been using the loch to practice their driving skills for quite some time. One witness, conservationist Adrian Shine, told CNN he had seen locals launching balls almost 300 feet into the waters.  Watch a video of balls being found at the bottom of Loch Ness. » . However, Shine doesn't believe this to be an environmental threat: ""Certainly it's undesirable, but I don't think it will have a significant environmental impact on the loch."" It seems missing and discarded golf balls may not be bad news for all concerned. David Roston has built a career out of wading through rivers and diving in lakes to collect and re-sell discarded golf balls. His online company www.lakeballs.co.uk have been retailing ""lake balls"" for almost 10 years, but even his powers of retrieval would be challenged by the monstrous task of recovering balls from the bottom of the loch.

"Washington (CNN) -- Just days after suggesting lawmakers might not debate U.S. military involvement in Syria until next year, House Speaker John Boehner said he'd agree to call Congress back into session to vote if President Barack Obama sends up a resolution asking for the authority. Boehner told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that if the President wanted a vote, ""I'd bring the Congress back"" -- never mind that the U.S. has already begun airstrikes inside Syria as part of a coalition. Boehner hopes the President requests and sends up an authorization for use of military force as soon as possible,"" his spokesman, Michael Steel, told CNN Monday. Boehner left a much different impression in an interview published Thursday in The New York Times. He told the Times he doesn't believe it was appropriate for the so-called ""lame duck"" Congress to vote on military action since so many members would be leaving and those just elected wouldn't be eligible to vote until January. ""I would suggest to you that early next year, assuming that we continue in this effort, there may be that discussion and there may be that request from the President,"" Boehner told the Times. Leaders from both parties have come under criticism for leaving town without debating action in Syria. ""It's an act of cowardice on the part of Congress,"" Sen. John McCain told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""They didn't want to vote before the election."" McCain: Watching ISIS rise is like 'watching a train wreck' Steel denied that the speaker was sending mixed messages. He noted that even though the Boehner continues to oppose taking up major policy issues during lame-duck sessions, he would schedule a war debate if the Obama administration decided it needed congressional approval of the military campaign against ISIS. Pressure on congressional leaders to vote on authorizing the war has been growing. Lawmakers left town earlier this month to campaign for the midterms. Since then, airstrikes in Iraq and Syria have intensified and many members are becoming increasingly vocal about the need for Congress to vote. It's unlikely the President would press for a vote before the midterms because many Democrats are reluctant to take a controversial vote ahead of the elections. Obama admits ISIS threat was misjudged as U.S. splits emerge . On Monday, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg News that Boehner shouldn't wait for the President to initiate a debate on Capitol Hill about ISIS. ""Since when do we sit around waiting, using the excuse he didn't ask?"" Pelosi said at a meeting with Bloomberg reporters, and added, ""No, if you want to have an authorization that has any constraints on the President, you don't wait for him to write it."" The speaker's office also held out the possibility that it would move on its own legislation. A day with John Boehner . Saying ""there's only one commander in chief at a time, and it is traditionally his responsibility"" to propose a new authorization, Steel told CNN ""the speaker hasn't ruled out independent congressional action if the president doesn't request"" an authorization for use of military force. Boehner criticized the President for repeatedly insisting no U.S. combat troops would be deployed to battle ISIS and indicated he could support sending U.S. combat troops into Syria at some point. ""We have no choice. These are barbarians. They intend to kill us. And if we don't destroy them first, we're going to pay the price,"" Boehner told ABC.","Lawmakers have left town until after the November elections .

"(CNN) -- Five-time champion Venus Williams has pulled out of next week's Wimbledon championships because of injury. The 33-year-old has not missed a tournament at the grass court finals since making her debut in 1997 but has struggled with a back injury in recent months. ""Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in Wimbledon this year,"" the American wrote on her Facebook page. ""I am extremely disappointed as I have always loved The Championships, but I need to take time to let my back heal. I look forward to returning to the courts as soon as possible."" Williams suffered her earliest French Open exit in 12 years last month when she crashed to a first-round defeat to Poland's Urszula Radwanska. She said her back had troubled her during the match and then pulled out of the doubles with her sister Serena, the world number one, because of the problem. In March, the seven-time grand slam champion was forced out of the Miami Masters because of the same injury to her lower back. Venus' withdrawal denies the world No. 34 the chance to get ahead of Serena at the championships, with both sisters tied on five singles titles apiece. Venus, who lost in the first round for the first time last year, won her titles in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, while Serena is the defending champion. Serena aside, the women's field only has two other ladies that have managed to win the title: Maria Sharapova, who succeeded in 2004, and 2011 champion Petra Kvitova. Despite her recent injury troubles, Venus' opponents may be relieved by the absence of a player who last contested the final in 2009, when she was beaten by her younger sister. ""My goal (is) to return on July 8 in Washington,"" the elder Williams said. ""Many thanks to my fans for the love and support and I will be seeing you very soon back on the courts."" Venus' absence means she will be unable to defend the doubles title she won last year with Serena, their fifth triumph at Wimbledon. The duo, who have contested four singles finals against one another at Wimbledon, also triumphed on Center Court last year when winning a gold medal in the doubles at the London Olympics.","Venus Williams withdraws from Wimbledon champions because of injury .

"HOOVER, Alabama (CNN) -- Nine-year-old Kyle Graddy looked out across a minor league baseball diamond for the first time in his life and pondered the possibility of his own death. Kyle Graddy, who has a peanut allergy, enjoys his first pro baseball game. Exposure to peanuts can be deadly for Kyle, who took advantage of a peanut-free night hosted by the Birmingham Barons in June to enjoy his first pro baseball game. ""I break out all over my arms and my neck, and it makes it hard for me to breathe,"" Kyle said, describing his symptoms. ""And it could cause death or something."" It was hardly an American boy's traditional ballpark initiation. But Kyle seemed to take it all in stride. He's among an estimated 1 percent of all U.S. children who have allergies to peanuts, according to the Johns Hopkins Children's Center. Among both children and adults, at least 120 U.S. deaths are blamed on peanut allergies each year. Direct exposure to peanuts or peanut-tainted products could throw Kyle into what doctors call an anaphylactic reaction, when the body's immune system overreacts, triggering the release of chemicals such as histamines that can lead to a range of conditions, from hives to life-threatening airway constriction. Doctors are trying to solve the mystery of why peanuts are deadly for Kyle and other food allergy sufferers. To minimize the threat, the Barons power-washed Regions Park stadium for several consecutive days before the game to get rid of any peanuts or their remnants, spokesman Justin Rosenberg said. All peanuts or related products were removed from the facility's vendor booths.  Watch as Kyle attends his first pro baseball game after the stadium undergoes thorough preparations » . Under the threat of rain on a muggy evening, the Graddys -- including Kyle's parents and two younger sisters, Amelia, 7, and Karlin, 4 -- took their seats in the center of the stadium where basketball legend Michael Jordan chased his baseball dreams 15 years before. Despite the team's promise of providing peanut-free food at vendors' booths, Kyle's mother, Barbara Graddy, packed her own munchies just to be safe. Along with a treasured red baseball cap, Kyle wore his EpiPen, the auto-injector -- dangling from a hook on his pants. If he has a severe reaction to peanuts, Kyle would use an auto-injector to give himself a shot of life-saving epinephrine, said Dirk Graddy, Kyle's father. ""I don't think he lives in fear of dying or anything. It's important for him to know the seriousness of it, if he lets his guard down."" Many might think that baseball games -- the subject of well-known song lyrics about ""peanuts and Cracker Jack"" -- would be among the most dangerous places for people with peanut allergies. But child food allergy specialist Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins Children's Center says the danger for older children with peanut allergies at stadiums is low. ""In the open air, it's actually very rare to have enough exposure to cause any sort of reaction."" More at risk, Wood said, are younger children ages 2 to 4 ""who are crawling around on the floor, picking up peanut shells."" The Graddys have been fighting peanut allergies since Kyle and his sister Amelia were diagnosed in 2004. A frightening episode at Amelia's preschool sparked the family crisis. ""It was scary, because she had put her hand in a bowl of M&Ms and then rubbed her eye,"" Amelia's mother said. ""Eventually, her eye was swollen shut. It looked like she had been punched."" Soon it became clear that the Graddy kids would have childhoods a little bit different than those of other kids. ""At first I was just really scared,"" Barbara Graddy said. ""I was afraid they were going to die at school. There was just such an uncertainly."" Eventually she reached out to experts online and in the medical community surrounding their hometown of Auburn, Alabama. Now she leads an allergy support group. From then on, Kyle and Amelia would bring their lunches instead of eating school food. They would ask classmates' parents not to send their children to school with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or any food that could be tainted with peanut products. They would always keep an auto-injector nearby, along with an emergency inhaler for asthma attacks, because they also suffer from asthma, which is common among children with food allergies. A 2008 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that food allergies are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Although experts don't know what's causing the increase, scientists are researching about a dozen supported theories that might solve the mystery, Wood said. The most popular, the hygiene theory, ""says we live in too clean an environment and that the less our immune systems are exposed to germs or bacterial byproducts, the more"" prone they are to allergies, he said. Other theories, he said, involve nutritional factors such as increased exposure to peanuts early in the diet, food processing or vitamins. One theory says low vitamin D may be behind the cause. ""In reality, it probably is a variety of things over the past 10 or 20 years in the environment that has led to this increase,"" Wood said. ""Quite promising"" immunotherapy studies are in very early stages, Wood said. They involve giving patients the proteins of foods they're allergic to, orally or under the tongue, until they are desensitized. ""There are clearly a majority of patients who can be desensitized to a certain point and at least some patients who appear to be completely cured of the allergy after going through these treatments."" Meanwhile, the Graddys are hopeful that Kyle's and Amelia's allergies will disappear as they enter adulthood, but that doesn't happen very often, experts say. The family is thinking about venturing out for another baseball game -- this time, at a stadium with peanuts. Dirk Graddy is talking about loading up the minivan and trekking to see the minor-league Biscuits play in nearby Montgomery. ""Yes, we might risk it,"" he smiled, ""as long as people aren't throwing peanuts.""","Kids with deadly food allergies enjoy rare peanut-free ballpark .

"(CNN) -- Why are Iraqi politicians dragging their feet while ISIS militants fortify their foothold across the country? Iraq's lawmakers are simply not going to ""let a war get in the way of their political disputes,"" as one expert succinctly put it last week. And while the country burns, her politicians remain deadlocked on who to appoint to key government posts following April's national elections. Iraq's new parliament convened for the first time on July 1 to elect a new speaker, but the session quickly descended into bickering between members of different parties and had to be rescheduled for July 8. But little changed in the ensuing week -- and with all sides failing to reach agreement on who to appoint to the key posts of speaker, president and prime minister, the session was delayed again, until this weekend. Iraq's political paralysis, even in the face of a threat as grave as ISIS' sweep across huge swathes of the country, is a sign of just how difficult an agreement will be to reach. At the heart of the political problem lies incumbent Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. His coalition secured a plurality of votes in the general elections, winning almost three times as many seats as the closest rival. But a third term for al-Maliki, a Shia Muslim, is a red line for Sunni, Kurdish and even rival Shia parties. MORE OPINION: Is Iran the only hope for peace? If al-Maliki's support is melting away, as it appears to be, why won't he just step down? Al-Maliki's intransigence may reflect a desire to ensure that his choice to succeed him -- his former chief of staff, who many believe is the most viable alternative candidate -- will be nominated without much resistance from the other political parties. ""Show him death and he will accept a fever"" is an Iraqi proverb that helps explain al-Maliki's insistence on remaining in power. Al-Maliki wants to exert enough pressure to ensure that the next government is formed on his terms even if he's not at the head of it. This may include a seat on the Presidency council as a Deputy, but it will certainly include a guarantee that he will not be prosecuted if he steps down. Al-Maliki's Shia rivals can't dictate the terms of the next government formation process because they face an uncomfortable reality: the Shias may have a majority in the new parliament, but the Maliki contingent has the vast majority of seats within that bloc. He may be excluded from heading the next government but his bloc cannot be ignored. READ MORE: Signs of war in an Iraqi market . This political paralysis is of course benefiting the various armed groups who do not believe in the political process and want to overthrow the post-2003 order. Iraq's Sunni politicians may have been directly elected by the people, but the masked men of ISIS -- many of whom are foreigners -- are the ones who now hold sway in much of western and northwestern Iraq. Many Sunnis are flirting with the revolutionaries that want a complete overthrow of the current order because that order -- built on an ethno-sectarian model -- handicaps Sunnis, given their minority status. But changing the status quo is a red line for the Shia because it has brought them to the helm of power for the first time in Iraq's modern history. The collapse of the political order is as much a red line for the Shia as it is for neighboring Iran, which enjoys close ties with their Shia allies in Baghdad. What to do in the face of this deadlock? The best-case scenario now would be a speedy government formation that leads to a greater decentralization of power whilst maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq. After 2010's general election it took nine months of horse-trading to get the various Sunni, Kurdish and Shia parties to agree on how best to divide the spoils of state amongst themselves. Now, there is recognition that Iraq does not have the luxury of dithering. ISIS insurgents will continue wreaking havoc in Iraq because they do not believe in the democratic process. But if the Sunni political parties can buy in to the new government, it will take the air out of the insurgency and prove to the militants that politics can indeed work to secure more rights and privileges. The worst-case scenario would be the de facto splitting up of Iraq. There is a ""vital"" Iraq that Iran and the Shia will fight to protect. This includes Baghdad, the city of Samarra to the north, the province of Diyala to the east and all nine Shia-dominated provinces in the south. Iranian-backed Shia militias have already mobilized to confront the insurgents and they will likely lead the efforts to secure this vital Iraq. If the political process fails yet again, the Shia would likely be willing to cede vast amounts of Sunni-dominated territory and the Kurdish-controlled province of Kirkuk in exchange for unrivaled supremacy in Baghdad and the strategic oil-producing province of Basra in the south. Iraq is on the brink of abyss again. Its leaders must act quickly.

"(CNN) -- The midflight breakdown of a JetBlue pilot has sparked concerns about psychological screening for flight crews. Capt. Clayton Osbon's erratic behavior prompted Flight 191 from New York to Las Vegas to make an unscheduled landing in Amarillo, Texas, on Tuesday after crew and passengers intervened and subdued the 49-year-old pilot. Osbon ""yelled jumbled comments about Jesus, September 11th, Iraq, Iran,and terrorists,"" according to a federal criminal complaint filed against Osbon. One passenger quoted Osbon as saying, ""Pray f------ now for Jesus Christ,"" the complaint said. ""It just seemed like something triggered him to go off the wall. He would be calm one minute and then just all of a sudden turn,"" said passenger Jason Levin. JetBlue pilot charged with interfering with flight crew . JetBlue has not elaborated on the pilot's condition, but CEO Dave Barger referred to the incident as a ""medical situation."" The pilot's behavior points to possible psychological distress, doctors say. The episode could be the result of bipolar disorder or a recent start on antidepressant medication, said Dr. Charles Raison, a psychiatrist at the University of Arizona and CNN consultant who has not treated Osbon. Medical illnesses such as brain tumors, subtle seizures or hormonal imbalances could also have caused Osbon's behavior, Raison said. All airline pilots are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to have a first-class medical certificate that must be renewed annually for pilots younger than 40 and every six months for pilots 40 and older. JetBlue follows all FAA pilot requirements, the airline said. Pilots must be examined by an aviation medical examiner as part of that process, and a candidate's psychological condition is assessed. The exam does not include a formal psychiatric evaluation, although the examiner should ""form a general impression of the emotional stability and mental state of the applicant,"" according to FAA's Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners. Bipolar disorders, psychotic disorders, personality disorders that involve ""acting out"" and substance dependence generally are disqualifying conditions, according to the guide. In these cases, the examiner would either deny issuing the certificate or defer it and report evidence of significant problems to the FAA, the guide says. ""If the person is exhibiting any signs of psychosis, thinks he's on the moon, is disoriented in time and place, if he's taking any medicines -- and the FAA is very strict -- the computer won't even let me give an exam if medicines are not approved. It's very strict under those circumstances,"" said Dr. Gabriel Guardarramas, an FAA-approved New York family doctor who performs about 40 pilot exams a year. Guardarramas said one pilot grieving the death of his father raised a red flag for him and he deferred certification to the FAA. ""Pilots as a rule are extremely stable people,"" said retired airline Capt. Steve Luckey, a 33-year veteran. ""By the time a person becomes a commercial pilot, they've gone through so many filters."" However, the agency's strict criteria prompt some to hide their conditions, according to two pilots who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity out of concern for their own careers. One veteran with three decades of experience said he's known just a single fellow pilot who sought treatment for depression. The treatment lasted eight or nine months, and he never told his employer, the pilot said. ""A guy has worked his whole career toward what he's gotten, and he's dealing with issues, what does he do? If he says, 'Hey, I'm depressed,' then the FAA pulls his medical certificates and then there goes his career."" Another veteran pilot echoed that sentiment: ""Yes, pilots are flying around depressed because if they do (admit depression), they'll be grounded."" ""Pilots are generally well psychologically screened for all the right reasons. Some people snap. If this pilot did indeed snap, it doesn't surprise me. There's tremendous pressure out there in the pilot group, and that's something the public should care about,"" the pilot said. In its medical examiners guide, the FAA says pilots being treated with four specific antidepressants may receive medical clearance, which would be decided on a case-by-case basis. Osbon's breakdown comes just weeks after an American Airlines flight attendant's behavior alarmed passengers and prompted flight crew members to restrain her while the plane was taxiing. One passenger said the flight attendant described herself as bipolar and said she had not taken her medication. Other accounts referred to her talking on the intercom about the plane crashing. American Airlines has not identified her, and no charges have been filed. She remains employed by the company, the airline said Wednesday. American said the airline follows all FAA rules. Unlike pilots, flight attendants are not required to pass medical examinations before they fly, according to the Association of Flight Attendants, a union that does not represent American Airlines workers. ""However, flight attendants do have to go through recurrent training each year to refresh their emergency situation skills,"" said AFA spokeswoman Corey Caldwell. They are also required to receive proficiency certification from the FAA. She added that ""in most cases,"" flight attendants could be treated for various conditions and still perform ""as first responders efficiently,"" noting that red flags would probably come up during the initial six- to eight-week training period or during a probationary period of up to a year. In addition to the pressure of performing the duties of flying itself, airline employees face the added stress of trying to survive in an industry fraught with restructuring, bankruptcies and other uncertainties. ""This industry is very turbulent,"" Caldwell said. ""And after 9/11, these workers really went through a very difficult time personally and professionally."" CNN's Mike Ahlers, Katia Hetter and Lizzie O'Leary contributed to this report.","JetBlue: Pilot incident a ""medical situation""

"(CNN) -- Her artwork is dark, bold and often sombre, with black figures and sinister skulls splattered across the canvasses. ""My mom was like, 'You were obsessed with skulls ever since you were a baby,'"" explains Michelle Wie, one of the world's leading female golfers. It's an infatuation that comes to the fore when she picks up a paintbrush; an infatuation she finds hard to explain and one seemingly at odds with the smiling poster girl who has been playing golf for as long as she can remember. ""I guess I'm half a very happy person, half a very morbid person,"" the 24-year-old told CNN. ""There's a lot of emotions and feelings you can't really get out any other way and I'm not a very good poet or lyricist. ""I definitely feel very in the moment when I paint."" In recent months, Wie has certainly been in the moment on the golf course. The Hawaii-born former child prodigy -- whose parents immigrated from South Korean -- won the first major of her career at June's U.S. Open, sweet relief for a player who has carried the weight of expectation on her shoulders for over a decade. ""I think that people have very high expectations of me,"" says Wie from her Florida home in a telephone interview. ""It's really tough being in the spotlight, everything you do is examined. ""That's the nature of the game. When you do well people praise you, but when you don't do well people will tear you apart. ""That's kind of the way fame is."" Interactive: Six seminal women's golf moments . Life in the public eye . Wie knows all about public scrutiny. In 2000, age 12, she became the youngest player to qualify for an event on the LPGA Tour -- the premier women's golf circuit. At just 13 she became the youngest woman to make the cut at an LPGA tournament, the prestigious Kraft Nabisco Championship -- one of the women's majors. At the 2004 Sony Open she became only the fourth -- and youngest -- female to play on the men's PGA Tour. Wie turned pro in 2005, just shy of her 16th birthday, and signed lucrative sponsorship deals with Nike and Sony. Age rules prevented her from joining the LPGA Tour until she turned 18, but she still competed in a number of events between 2005 and 2008. However her teenage body was struggling under the strain; she injured both wrists in 2007 while she also suffered a drop in form resulting in missed cuts and disqualifications. ""It was tough at times, I'm not going to lie,"" she admits. ""I experienced things that, at 16, 17, many other people couldn't have."" Wie missed out on experiences most teenagers treasure, notably that cornerstone of American adolescence -- high school graduation. ""Obviously you make sacrifices, you want to be really good at your craft,"" she says. ""That's the decision I made, when I was younger, that I wanted to be really good at something. ""You can't have all the fun of being a kid and try to fulfill your dream. I sacrificed a few things here and there, but I think I did a really good job of living a balanced life."" College comforts . Study helped to soothe Wie's mind. She is the latest in a line of academics -- her father was a professor at Hawaii University and her paternal grandfather was a professor emeritus of Seoul University. In September 2007 she enrolled at Stanford to study communications, although Wie's status as a professional prevented her from following in the footsteps of Tiger Woods and joining Stanford's illustrious golf team. ""Going to Stanford really helped me to be semi normal,"" she said. ""I love studying, I love everything about it. I grew up on a college campus. Going to Stanford was one of my biggest dreams growing up. I'm so happy that I got to achieve it."" With a fondness for making study guides and PowerPoint presentations, Wie's ability to speed read helped her keep up with her schoolwork while simultaneously attempting to launch her professional golf career. In the future, when she puts down her golf clubs for good, Wie plans to conquer the corporate world by returning to school to study business. ""There are some business endeavors that I'd like to embark on -- I don't want to enter them and be blindsided,"" she explains. ""I'll go back to school, half because I really want to go back to school and experience college life again, and half because I just want to learn a lot about (business.)"" Wie comes across as someone in constant need of stimulation, whether it's a physical workout on the greens and fairways or expanding her mind through reading and study. She jokes that her friends say she has ""ADD"" because she rarely sits still. This hyperactivity meant she tried a number of sports as youngster, searching for ""something to be good at."" Eventually she settled on golf. As a self-confessed perfectionist, the ups and downs of her golf career have taught the usually meticulous Wie to relax a little. ""I've learned to roll with the punches,"" she admits. ""I'm a big believer in just trying things out. If you fail, at least you tried."" Artistic expression . Art is a relatively recent addition to Wie's repertoire. During her school years, her friends were artistic while she was ""the sporty one."" Five years ago, her best friend gave her a sketchbook and suggested she gave it a try. From there, Wie's interest has snowballed and now her Instagram and Twitter profiles proudly display her eye-catching work. ""When I was in middle school I definitely went through a gothic, emo phase,"" she says. ""I don't know how to paint happy. I think it releases a lot of the darker feelings in me. My happier ones are always on the exterior. ""There are definitely two sides of me, for sure."" Light to the shade of her dark art is being provided by the most successful season of her pro career, which has featured two of her four career titles. Her U.S. Open triumph came after a second-place finish at the Kraft Nabisco Championship and a win at April's Lotte Championship. Another wrist injury has put her back on the treatment table, meaning she missed the season's fifth and final major this month in France, but once she's recovered she has her sights set on making more history. For the first time in over a century, women's golf will be contested at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and Wie is eying the top of the podium. ""It's definitely a huge goal of mine,"" she says. ""Being able to represent your country and being able to win a gold medal would be one of my highest achievements, for sure."" For the ultimate perfectionist, it seems only gold will do.","Michelle Wie is one of the world's most recognizable female golfers .

"(CNN) -- The graphic footage of the wooden boat carrying up to 100 Iranian, Iraqi and Kurdish asylum seekers as it wrecked last week on the cliffs of Christmas Island has been seen around the world. At least 30 bodies have been recovered. Eighteen are still missing and presumed dead. Three children have been orphaned. The scenes have stunned residents of Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. Many residents tried in vain to assist those thrown into the sea as their boat broke apart. The disaster itself raises serious questions. How was it possible the boat could get so close to Christmas Island without the Australian navy being aware of its pending arrival? Emergency services might not have been as prepared as they should have been. A commissioned report by the Australian government in January said, ""Some key island stakeholders such as medical, transport and port authority staff are not informed of the arrival of a vessel until the last possible moment."" Certainly the navy, which systematically patrols the waters between Indonesia and Christmas Island, was caught napping. It took an hour and half for a small navy boat to arrive to render assistance. But the bigger questions concern the Australian government's asylum polices and the arrival of refugee boats. More asylum seekers arrive in Australia by plane than by boat. There is no hysteria about their arrival. They are not routinely detained. The 20 pilgrims from Zimbabwe, Burundi, Kenya and Pakistan who applied for asylum following the Catholic Church's World Youth Day in Sydney in 2008 were not branded as ""queue jumpers."" But boat arrivals elicit a different response. Subject to mandatory detention on arrival, more than 5,700 asylum seekers -- including more than 800 children -- are in detention centers, with 2,700-plus on Christmas Island. More than 2,000 have been in detention for more than six months, and that figure is growing. Refugee boats were a major feature of this year's federal election. Both major political parties campaigned on being tough with asylum seekers. In the wake of the election, public opinion has shifted against asylum seekers. But it is the policies of the Australian government that are largely responsible for pushing asylum seekers to get on boats to make the sometimes risky journey from Indonesia. The tragedy highlights three features of Australia's refugee policy that must change. First, Australia has increasingly pressured the Indonesia government to detain asylum seekers -- whether or not they are mandated refugees under the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR. Seekers are held in detention centers sometimes funded by the Australian government. This in itself is a strong incentive for asylum seekers to leave Indonesia as soon as possible. Second, until this year, Australia did not routinely resettle UNHCR refugees from Indonesia. This year, the Australian government said it will take 500 refugees from Indonesia, although, so far, fewer than 100 have been resettled, and the government has not guaranteed numbers for the future. It sometimes takes months for UNHCR to register asylum seekers and then more months for those claims to be processed. Once determined to be refugees, they can wait years for the UNHCR to find a country willing to resettle them. Understandably, other resettling countries consider asylum seekers in Indonesia to be Australia's responsibility. The lack of any guaranteed resettlement is another powerful incentive for asylum seekers to take the boat journey from Indonesia to Australia. If Australia were willing to process asylum seekers and guarantee resettlement, far fewer asylum seekers would want or need to take the boat journey. Yet Prime Minister Julia Gillard's Labor government takes proportionally fewer refugees than was the case under the conservative John Howard government. Third, the Australian government's move to criminalize people-smuggling (and by association asylum seekers themselves) in Indonesia and Australia also provides a powerful disincentive for asylum boats to contact Australian authorities should they require assistance. A year ago, the Australian government called on the Indonesian government to intercept a boat of 253 Tamil asylum seekers. After a standoff at the Indonesian port of Merak, the Tamils were imprisoned at Tanjung Pinang, although all but 17 were found to be refugees. While the extreme weather may have been the immediate cause of the disaster at Christmas Island, just as surely, government policies drove that boat onto the cliffs. The pursuit of cheap electoral advantage has motivated successive governments to adopt such punitive policies. They behave as if there is a crisis when there is none. Those policies have cost the lives of at least dozens of people and scarred the lives of thousands of others who have been detained. In the Christmas Island tragedy, there is also an opportunity for a drastic shift in policy. Refugee advocates and members of the Labor Party have urged the government to seize this moment to implement a truly humanitarian policy. Whether Australia's political leaders have the courage to make the shift remains to be seen. But the lives of future asylum seekers depend on their response. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ian Rintoul.","Ian Rintoul: Dozens of asylum seekers die in boat wreck off Australia's Christmas Island .

"(CNN) -- Why do people want to visit North Korea? The closed and strictly regulated country is not particularly welcoming to guests. Going in or out is complicated for visitors and impossible for anyone who offends the government. The slightest negative remark about the country's ruling family can be considered treason. Some Koreans who have left the country want to visit family or see the place where they were born. Some non-Korean travelers want to see a place most people won't ever get to visit. Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, wanted to see the country where he had once fought a war. The North Korean government certainly doesn't it make it easy for foreigners to visit. If you're American, the rules are even stricter. And then there's the danger of something going wrong, as it did for the 85-year-old Newman. Newman was on an airplane to depart North Korea for Beijing on October 26 after a government-sanctioned tour when he was removed from the aircraft, his son told CNN on Wednesday. His family hasn't heard from him since. On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of State advised U.S citizens not to travel to North Korea, noting ""the risk of arbitrary arrest and (long-term) detention of U.S. citizens in North Korea."" Four U.S. citizens have been arrested for entering North Korea illegally since January 2009, and two U.S. citizens with valid visas were arrested there on other charges, the State Department warned. The British Foreign & Commonwealth Office isn't warning their citizens against making the trip, but its website does warn against making ""insults or jokes about the North Korean political system and its leadership"" or taking pictures of Korean officials or guarded buildings. ""In 2008 a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted military area was shot dead. Take care to remain in permitted areas and move away immediately if asked to do so by North Korean officials."" How Americans get to North Korea . All tourists must book a guided tour with one of about a dozen companies approved by the state-run Korea International Travel Company. (The tour operators should walk you through the visa and other requirements.) And U.S. citizens face specific restrictions that don't apply to other travelers. They can only enter the country via airplane, unlike other travelers who can enter from China by train. American travelers often fly into North Korea via China, so the U.S. Department of State recommends getting a multiple-entry visa for China, since a valid Chinese visa is required to re-enter China after leaving North Korea. Once in Beijing, travelers approved by the North Korean government may get North Korean visas at the country's Beijing embassy. No freedom of speech here . The U.S. Department of State recommends that Americans register with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, and the Swedish Embassy in North Korea. (The United States doesn't have diplomatic relations with North Korea.) Americans must remember they aren't in the United States anymore, and U.S. constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech or religion don't apply in North Korea -- or any other foreign country. Sensitivity to a very different political reality is required. Slipping away from your hotel and government-required guide to explore can get you and your guide in trouble. Talking to North Koreans without permission -- even if they don't speak English -- can also get both of you in trouble. Even throwing away an official newspaper bearing a photo of a member of the Kim family, which are treated with the deference usually given to religious objects, has gotten travelers in trouble, said one U.S.-based Asia travel expert, who didn't want to be named so he wouldn't be banned from traveling to North Korea. ""If you think you can do whatever you want, you are going to get other people in trouble,"" said the expert, who has led tours to North Korea. ""You really have to be careful about what you say. Be conscious of the fact you're going to get other people in trouble for your actions. Observe, don't proselytize.""

"(CNN) -- ""The Elders have spoken and my bride price is NGN630, 000. I'm a Super Premium babe na!"" Knowing your worth has taken on new meaning since the launch of ""Bride Price,"" the app that calculates the users' value based on answers to a series of ranked questions ranging from height and weight to leg shape and cooking skills. You could lose a whopping 60% of your bride price for being a ""Mama Ronke,"" the heaviest weight category, while ""sexy bow legs"" a la BeyoncÃ© would add N20,000 ($123) to your price. As entertaining as this quiz may be to complete, categories like skin color could be cause for concern. To begin with, the app uses the controversial term ""Half-caste,"" which would add N50,000 ($308) to your worth, just like the answer ""Lupita"" -- some say this pays testament to the impact Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o has had on the perceptions of beauty and darker skinned girls. While ""dark"" is still ranked as the second most undesirable skin color, skin bleachers are also devalued. The scrutiny is not over yet; face quality is then assessed, followed by nine more categories. Be careful in the final bonus round, you could be fined N40, 000 ($264) for being a ""club girl."" Such a controversial app comes with a disclaimer, of course. ""Bride Price,"" which was developed by Lagos-based digital agency Anakle, has had two million views since its release on May 25, the vast majority of which came from women. People from over 180 countries have used the app, according to the company, with Nigeria, the United States and the UK generating the most traffic. The app quickly went viral after a private link was tweeted on Sunday May 25, forcing the brand to switch servers, and ""Bride Price"" to trend in Nigeria. The term bride price nowadays refers to a usually symbolic amount of money or gifts given to a woman's family by her fiance at the time of their marriage. In some cases, however, families return the symbolic payment to signify that their daughter is not for sale. Juliet Gilbert, who has just completed a PhD in social anthropology researching young women's livelihoods in Nigeria, says the ""bride price is an incredibly significant part of marriage customs in Nigeria"" that ""should be seen as a token of respect towards and provision for family and community, rather than a monetary value placed on an individual female."" She explains that in Calabar, for example, ""the bride price itself is negotiated after the first formal 'introduction,' when the fiance is introduced to the girl's parents. The girl's family will then write a list of everything they require from the fiance's family -- this is not just money but could also include rice, (fresh) palm wine or crates of beer and soft drinks. ""The fiance's family then look at the list and agree on what they can afford before going back to negotiate with the girl's family. There is then a formal meeting of both families, where the girl identifies her fiance in front of her whole family, who check that everything on the list has been brought to them. Only after this is all satisfactorily achieved can the traditional marriage go ahead."" Gilbert adds, however, that the bride price practices vary considerably between ethnic groups, and even within them due to families' wealth and status. ""It is custom for fathers in Ogoja (northern Cross River State) to give back the money to his new son-in-law during the traditional marriage ceremony, saying, 'My daughter cannot be bought but you can marry her.'"" Editi Effiong, who owns Anakle, has made it clear that the app is supposed to be a bit a fun. His own wife, he says, was one of the first users of the app which was developed by a mostly female team: . ""Did I pay a bride price?"" he asks. ""Yes! Nigeria is a big, complex country, with over 200 tribes, but where I come from, the entire process of marriage is designed to show respect to the wife's family,"" adds Effiong. ""As insignificant as the bride price is -- N30 ($0.18) in my case -- it must be collected. I value this tradition, and think it's a part of our culture we must preserve. ""I went overboard with buying gifts for my wife's family, because I was very young then, and I wanted to show I really respected them. It may be hard for our foreign audience to understand, but I don't see why the scores on any app, joke or not, should affect the love I have for my wife, or her self-worth."" The app has had mixed reactions both in Nigeria and across the world with some seeing the funny side, such as British-Nigerian journalist Bim Adewunmi, who wrote a tongue-in-cheek commentary on it for the Independent. Others were outraged, including Cosmopolitan's Frank Kobola who labeled it a ""horrifying, sexist quiz"" and Ikechukwu Onyemelukwe who has started a petition to remove the app which reached 100 signatures on May 28. While many users shared their bride price on Twitter. Although there were some concerns about the criteria. Effiong told CNN the reasoning behind this: ""That's a Nigerian inside joke. On the average Nigerian street, there's a joke that 'too much book dey worry person' (a tongue-in-cheek reference to too much education). But this doesn't mean PhDs are devalued. ""Over the weekend, we hosted a party for my former boss, who just bagged a PhD. Nigerians are some of the most educated people in the world.

"(CNN) -- If you discovered water that could be millions or billions of years old, would you taste it? Barbara Sherwood Lollar does it all the time. She's a geologist in the department of Earth Sciences at the University of Toronto, and collaborated with other researchers on analyzing water found in a Canadian mine in Timmins, Ontario. They published the findings in the journal Nature in May, showing that the water is between 1.5 and 2.6 billion years old -- meaning it has been totally isolated for that long. Lollar dipped the tip of her finger in this water and tested it with her tongue. She found the ancient sample ""very salty and bitter -- much saltier than seawater."" But while this may sound horrifying, geologists often use their own senses in sampling, she said. It's not just for fun: They're working in dark environments with multiple fractures of water, and they know the waters they want to analyze further are the saltiest, as they're likely to be the oldest. ""If you're a geologist who works with rocks, you've probably licked a lot of rocks,"" she said. Ancient water found in Canadian mine . It takes more than a taste test to figure out how old water is, however. ""We can get a sense of antiquity by looking at things like salinity of the water, and more particularly, looking at oxygen and hydrogen in the water molecule itself,"" she said. Scientists looked at the amounts of noble gases in the water -- helium is one, for example -- and which isotopes were present. These are signatures of the approximate age of water. This research has implications for what life may exist on other planets. ""Equally on somewhere like Mars, any life that formed could have found its way into similar pockets of water in the Martian crust, and our work shows that these pockets of water can survive and provide a place for the life to have survived long after the surface of Mars lost its water and became sterile,"" said Chris Ballentine, professor of geochemistry at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and senior author on the study, said in an e-mail. Miners have known about the presence of deep salty waters for some time in Canada, Finland and South Africa. Mining literature even mentions it in the 1880s -- but it flew under the radar of scientists until recently. At a different Canadian mine, Lollar and colleagues went to investigate these waters. They discovered that the chemistry was similar to the kinds of waters found in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. They also saw that the high salinity of these waters was a result of the chemical reactions going on between the rocks and the water. ""This results in water that's full of the kind of energy that can support life,"" she said. In a South African gold mine, Lollar and colleagues found microbial communities at 1.7 miles deep, living off of dissolved hydrogen in these waters. The waters themselves on the order of tens of millions of years old. That work inspired them to return to Canada, to the Timmins mine, because they theorized that even older waters might flow there, based on the age and geology of the rocks. Down in the mine, it's ""dark, dusty, very noisy and hot,"" Ballentine said. The ancient water found there is a natural phenomenon; it's not there because of the mines. ""It's just that the mines allow us to get down there and get at them,"" Lollar said. ""They're our equivalent of the deep sea submarines."" The waters themselves are flowing, bubbling out of fractures in the rock, or boreholes that intersect with the fractures. The next step is to estimate the age of other deep waters all over the planet, so that they can compare and contrast what they may find in terms of life that lives far underground in these packets of water. They are still in the process of looking for life in the samples from the Timmins mine; working up this data is ""painstaking work,"" she said. Ballentine said the water is not drinkable, but admitted, ""the water is crystal clear when it first comes out of the rock and looks very tempting."" Lollar is quick to deny full-on drinking these ancient waters -- she's literally just talking about putting the tip of her finger to the tip of her tongue.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials said Thursday evening they have ""specific, credible but unconfirmed"" information about a potential threat against the United States coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""We have received credible information very recently about a possible plot directed at the homeland that seems to be focused on New York and Washington, D.C.,"" a senior administration official told CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr. The official said the plot was believed to involve three individuals, including a U.S. citizen. U.S. officials believed the threat was a vehicle laden with explosives, but ""the intelligence picture is not completely formed,"" the official said. ""Not enough is known about the potential operatives and their plotting."" The threat is believed to entail a vehicle bomb, but ""we cannot rule out other means,"" a U.S. official said. A senior law enforcement official involved in briefings about the matter told CNN Justice Department Producer Terry Frieden that his best information is that the three individuals had not yet entered the United States. The information came in around noon Wednesday, one official said. A senior federal law enforcement official intimately involved in counterterrorism efforts told CNN Chief National Correspondent John King authorities ""aren't sure if this is or real or just chatter."" The official confirmed the threat was vehicle-related. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Thursday night that while additional police will be deployed around the city, ""There's no reason for any of the rest of us to change ... our daily routines."" Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged residents to be cautious, but said ""there is no reason to panic."" In Washington, local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since September 1. ""I want to urge all of our citizens ... to remain calm and let our law enforcement professionals do their job.  At the same time, we ask people to remain vigilant,"" Mayor Vincent Gray said.  ""If you see something, say something."" Unattended vehicles around key infrastructure will be towed, Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said. Federal officials said they were taking the threat seriously, while evidently trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace during key events. ""It's accurate that there is specific, credible but unconfirmed threat information,"" said Matthew Chandler, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. ""As we always do before important dates like the anniversary of 9/11, we will undoubtedly get more reporting in the coming days. Sometimes this reporting is credible and warrants intense focus, other times it lacks credibility and is highly unlikely to be reflective of real plots under way. ""Regardless, we take all threat reporting seriously, and we have taken, and will continue to take, all steps necessary to mitigate any threats that arise. We continue to ask the American people to remain vigilant as we head into the weekend,"" Chandler said in a prepared statement. A Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on background, said, ""We will continue to respond appropriately to protect the American people from an evolving threat picture in the coming days and beyond. This may include an increased law enforcement presence at airports and other transit hubs, land and sea ports of entry, federal buildings, and other high-profile and critical infrastructure locations."" The information originated from the tribal border area of Pakistan and Afghanistan, a federal official told CNN producer Mike Ahlers. Another source gave CNN conflicting information about possible details of the threat. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said very specific details were made known to lawmakers about the threat. ""Many agencies are looking at this from every possible angle,"" he said. But it is not known yet if the threat is real, he said, adding, ""I would tell people now to go about their lives. There's no need to panic."" A senior administration official with firsthand knowledge told CNN National Security Contributor Fran Townsend that although there is ""specific, credible but unconfirmed threat information,"" there are a lot of questions about this information -- ""weird things."" A federal law enforcement official told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti that the threat appears to go beyond intelligence gathered from Osama bin Laden's compound after he was killed by Navy SEALs. That information talked about aspirations to carry out an attack on U.S. interests on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. ""The president was briefed,"" a senior administration official said. ""He directed that the intelligence community and the administration take all necessary steps to ensure vigilance."" Earlier Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters that intelligence officials had picked up ""lots of chatter"" on jihadi websites and elsewhere about the impending 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks ""and we're taking it all seriously,"" but nothing yet that warranted issuing a threat advisory. Nonetheless, the department will be at a heightened level of readiness as the nation commemorates the anniversary, ""staffing up"" the Federal Air Marshals Service and other agencies, she said. Napolitano said it is not uncommon to see increased chatter before major events. ""We know it's an iconic day to al Qaeda, in part because of what was found at the (Osama bin Laden) compound. So we are preparing accordingly,"" she said. ""I don't want to give those (details) out because I don't want to tell the bad guys exactly what we're doing,"" Napolitano said. ""But I think it's fair to say that in addition to asking citizens to be vigilant and so forth, that we have ourselves leaned forward and have made sure that we are doing all that we can from the DHS perspective."" CNN's Jessica Yellin, Jim Barnett and Pam Benson also contributed to this report.","NEW:  Washington officials say stay calm and vigilant .

"(CNN) -- All I want for Christmas is a triple-nipple baby bottle, some extinct goat DNA, and a Mars survival kit. Is that really too much to ask? Not if you happened to walk past a particular neon-lit convenience store in downtown Brooklyn -- the flashing sign in the window advertising ""Cash for genes."" Inside the unremarkable 99¢ shop you'd find the usual assortment of hair accessories, shoelaces, and cleaning products; the only thing binding them together being their ""Low! Low!"" price. But take a closer look and you'd also discover strange items from the future -- a universal language translator, a liquid cash injection kit, even some spacesuit lining (for when those bothersome transgenic moths eat through your helmet). This is the world according to the Extrapolation Factory -- a group of New York designers using a mixture of expert reports and crowd-sourcing to create products anywhere from 10 to 10,000 years in the future. Made in Brooklyn . Now items from their ""99c Store of the Future"" -- a one-off installation where space-age objects were sold in an ordinary shop -- has gone on display in China's first state-run contemporary art gallery. The Shanghai Power Station of Art -- a former power station turned museum overlooking Huangpu River -- last week launched its Design Shanghai 2013 exhibition, showcasing over 500 works from around the world. ""We're contributing 30 products that came from the 99¢ store -- very peculiar, bespoke future objects,"" said Elliott Montgomery, co-founder of the Extrapolation Factory. ""By putting these ideas out there, we're pushing the way people think about consumerism far beyond the immediate. It'll be interesting to see how people's reactions in Shanghai differ from those in New York City."" Futuring . The surreal project is part of a growing movement in design called ""Futuring"" -- which as the name suggests, involves creating products for the future. ""The incorporation of futures thinking into the design world has picked up pace hugely since the mid-2000s,"" said Stuart Candy, professor of foresight and design at Ontario College of Art and Design. ""With massive global challenges looming, like climate change, peak oil, and economic volatility, we need to develop a cultural capacity for thinking ahead and creating options -- so we aren't just reacting to crisis after crisis."" But ""Futuring"" isn't just about developing environmentally-friendly cars or search-and-rescue robots. As the Extrapolation Factory showed, it can also be found in the ordinary 99¢ store down the road, or what Candy describes as ""Guerrilla Futuring."" ""The 99¢ store project is interesting because it's a rare invitation to imagine the future's mundane side,"" he added. ""Popular notions of the future often get stuck in a kind of glossy rut - gleaming buildings and whiz-bang inventions -- and it's not often that we see the futures of everyday life brought into focus."" Design . So how did the Extrapolation Factory create their intriguing objects? The group -- comprising 33-year-olds Elliott Montgomery and Chris Woebken, who met after studying design interactions at London's Royal College of Art -- put the call out for members of the public interested in ""futuring."" On a snowy day in New York City, they gathered 40 people -- ranging from seven-year-old kids to middle aged architects -- and asked them to read think-tank reports on the future. ""The forecasts were from a broad spectrum -- obesity as a percentage of the UK population, robots in the homes of South Koreans, shortages of chocolate, acceptance of drug use, and technology,"" said Montgomery. The participants then wrote a short story imagining a world where these forecasts came to life. A table was laid out with various items from other 99¢ stores, which they used to create new products for their fantastical fables. ""We got some very bleak futures where environmental scenarios were really devastating, like the dying out of coral reefs. So products like the ""Grow Your Own Coral Reef"" responded to those issues,"" said Montgomery. ""At the same time there were people who imaged a future of great possibilities. One of the children was responding to the idea of robots in all our homes, who would help her brush her pet chinchilla. So the product she made was an arm attachment for your chinchilla-brushing robot."" What next? There's an interesting parallel in seeing objects from the 99¢ store of the future going on display in China -- one of the world's biggest makers of cheap, mass-produced products. ""It seems appropriate that the project be brought from New York to Shanghai,"" said Candy. ""It prompts us to think about the supply chains - in which China is a critical link - which make the phenomenon of 99¢ stores possible in the developed world."" So could these fantastical 99¢ items become reality? ""We're not asking people to predict, but more to dream,"" said Montgomery. ""Or produce nightmares, if that's what will help us make decisions in the present.""","What would 99¢ store of the future look like? Two NY designers found out .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ray J Norwood pleaded no contest to trespassing to settle charges that he grabbed a woman's buttocks, smashed a police car window and spat on a cop, a prosecutor said Thursday. Norwood, infamous as Kim Kardashian's partner in the sex tape that launched her reality show career, was arrested after an incident at a Beverly Hills hotel on May 30. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Edward Moreton sentenced Norwood, 33, to three years of probation and 50 hours of community service for the trespassing conviction. He'll also have to attend alcohol therapy and anger management classes. Norwood also is banned from the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, to which he must pay restitution determined at a hearing in December. The singer-reality TV star was charged last month with four misdemeanor counts of sexual battery, vandalism, resisting arrest and battery. Beverly Hills police arrested him at the hotel after a woman complained that he ""grabbed her buttocks,"" a police statement said. Although the initial police report said it was decided that the ""contact was incidental,"" the complaint alleged that it was sexual battery because Ray J did ""unlawfully touch an intimate part"" of the woman for the ""specific purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification and sexual abuse."" The vandalism, battery and resisting arrest charges stemmed from what happened after police arrived at the hotel. Norwood ""became belligerent with the valets and refused to leave,"" despite repeated requests by hotel security, the police statement said. ""After the uniform police officers took Mr. Norwood into custody and placed him in the rear of a police vehicle, he became belligerent and used his feet to shatter the side window of the police vehicle,"" the police statement said. ""Mr. Norwood was subsequently removed from the police vehicle in order to restrain his feet; at which time he became combative and spat into the face of one of the officers.""

"(CNN) -- A mentally disabled woman and her daughter were held in an Ohio apartment crowded with people and animals for more than a year, forced to perform manual labor and threatened with dogs and snakes to keep them compliant, authorities said Tuesday. Federal prosecutors said the people accused of holding the pair in Ashland, about 60 miles south of Cleveland, collected the woman's government benefits and beat her in order to get painkillers for themselves. They kept her in a room with a free-ranging iguana and ordered her to feed the reptile fruits and vegetables her daughter was denied, according to court papers. Sometimes their captors' pit bulls got table food while they had to eat from cans, according to an arrest affidavit quoting witnesses. ""The living conditions were simply subhuman,"" said Steven Dettelbach, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. ""(We're) talking about people who were locked in rooms, forced to work all the time, people who were threatened and beaten and injured, people who were exploited, people who had their money and benefits stolen, sort of used as pawns to get drugs,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""And the worst part of all this is, you know, they tried to rob the victims of their basic human dignity. So almost everything they did was to prey on them, prey on their vulnerabilities and exploit them."" The mother and daughter were sometimes forced to eat dog food, according to a law enforcement source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation. They were also frequently denied access to the bathroom, FBI Special Agent Eric Smith told reporters. ""They were physically punished for toiletry accidents,"" he said, ""and they were threatened not only with weapons but also with vicious animals, to include pit bulls and pythons."" Family and attorney deny accusations . Three people -- 26-year-old Jordie Callahan, 31-year-old Jessica Hunt and 33-year-old Daniel Brown -- were arrested and charged with forced labor. Callahan is facing an additional count of witness tampering, and another arrest could come soon, the U.S. attorney's office in Cleveland said. Callahan's mother, Becky, told CNN's Piers Morgan that the accusations are false, and that the alleged victim was allowed to leave the apartment whenever she wanted. ""There are so many lies going on,"" she said, accusing investigators of trumping up the case to draw attention to the small city of Ashland. ""She was giving them a couple hundred dollars a month for staying there. She was getting her own food. She wasn't being starved,"" Callahan's mother said. Her son, she said, is devastated by the accusations. ""He's devastated that all of this is being said about them. They have some pit bulls and snakes, so they are making them out to be evil because they have that,"" she said. ""He loves reptiles. He always has since he was a kid."" An attorney for Callahan told CNN affiliate WOIO that the allegations are ludicrous. ""She had opportunities to leave. She left several times and came back. So this was a mutual arrangement for her,"" Attorney Andy Hyde told WOIO. ""I don't like that the federal prosecutors held a press conference to pat themselves on the back."" Attorneys representing Hunt and Brown could not be immediately reached by CNN for comment. Prosecutor: 'They treated her worse than they treated the animals' But a criminal complaint filed this week alleges that the mother and her daughter were padlocked inside the bedroom they shared. ""These individuals in this case preyed upon a human being's disability and her desire to protect her child, the most fundamental of human traits,"" Dettelbach said. The suspects ""used that to force her into servitude, to work like an animal, and indeed, as the complaint alleges, they treated her worse than they treated the animals that were in that house."" Hunt and Callahan are a couple but are not married, FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson said. Brown was a friend of theirs, she said. Before they were allegedly forced into servitude for two years, the victims knew their alleged captors, the law enforcement source said. The woman was identified in court papers only as ""S.E."" Investigators stated Callahan and Hunt persuaded her to move into the apartment they shared with Hunt's four sons and ""numerous"" animals, knowing she ""suffered from a cognitive disability and received monthly public assistance payments."" That was in May 2011. Her plight came to the attention of authorities in October 2012, when she was arrested for trying to steal a candy bar from a store. Then she was arrested on a state child-welfare charge as part of the case, Ashland Police Chief David Marcelli said. ""The officers that took that complaint detected that there was other issues aside from the shoplifting,"" Marcelli said. He said officers had had ""numerous involvements"" with the people involved, ""and in the course of interviewing her, they discovered the rest of these facts slowly."" According to prosecutors, Callahan showed police a mobile-phone video of S.E. beating her child. S.E. told police that she had been told to do so by Callahan and Hunt and that Callahan threatened to show police the video if she ""messed up"" or went to authorities. S.E. was released from jail in February after being sentenced to time served on the abuse charge, and her daughter is now in foster care, said Michael Tobin, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. Once the full picture emerged, Ashland police called in the FBI, ""and shortly after, the suspects were indicted,"" Marcelli said. 'All of us...need to work on being better neighbors' Callahan and Hunt kept tabs on the woman and child with a baby monitor, with Hunt taking the woman's government benefit cards, authorities said. ""Callahan and Hunt forced S.E. to clean the house, do laundry, walk to the store to do their shopping and care for their numerous pit bulls and reptiles,"" the prosecution statement said. Her child was kept in the apartment when she was sent to the store, they said. Tuesday's announcement comes more than a month after the rescue of three women from a Cleveland home where police said a man had held them captive for about a decade. Authorities believe there is no connection between the Ashland investigation and that case, the law enforcement source said. Dettelbach, the federal prosecutor, said Tuesday's arrests are part of a broader push to crack down on what he called ""modern-day slavery."" ""We need your help in these efforts. Law enforcement cannot do it alone. All of us in the northern district of Ohio need to work on being better neighbors,"" he said. ""We need to ask questions, hard questions, when we see something that doesn't look right. We need to not be afraid to pick up the phone and to call law enforcement. We need to not be afraid to ask those simple questions -- is everything OK? Is there some way I can help you? As Ohioans and as Americans, that is who we are, and it is our duty.

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- I live in Malabar Hill in Mumbai, an area of the city whose residents are drawn mainly from the Jain and Gujarati communities and where vegetarianism is a big part of their cultural identity. I, however, eat meat. Am I an exception in my neighborhood? Not anymore. It turns out many more people are abandoning vegetarianism in India, which seems to run counter to what is happening in many other countries where people are turning away from meat. India is now one of the fastest growing markets for chicken in the world. The appetite for chicken here is growing at around 12% a year, according to India's National Sample Survey Office -- that's faster than any other type of meat. This is a big deal because India is still among the lowest meat consumers in the world. ""They aren't just eating it, they are also talking a lot more about it,"" says Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal, a popular Indian food writer and consultant. ""It's cooler to talk about being a meat lover than a vegetable lover!"" Economy drives meat appetite . She says Indians are developing new tastes because their incomes have grown -- India's economy is slowly heading in the right direction again; people are earning more, they are traveling more and are being exposed to new, international cuisines. There's also a lot more food available in India these days. When I was growing up in Kolkata, food options were limited to chicken, goat meat and whatever fish was available in the Hooghly River that ran through the city. Today, I have a food delivery service that will drop off everything from tuna and salmon to sea bass. Local grocery stores stock premium quality ham and meats. And chicken -- there are multiple companies selling chicken in all forms and cuts: chicken sausages, chicken nuggets, chicken salami. ""Business has boomed, we are growing larger and larger as the day comes,"" says Perizaad Zorabian, marketing head of Zorabian chicken, a premium niche poultry business. It's become so busy that Zorabian has put her Bollywood acting career on hold to focus on the family business. Healthy option? There are many reasons Indians are turning to chicken. Top of the list is the perception that it's healthy. People are generally more conscious about eating right and eating healthy foods -- especially the younger generation, Zorabian says. Given that 100 grams of chicken gives you more protein than 100 grams of cooked lentils, many people are turning to the white meat. It was a chicken curry that tempted Nikhil Merchant to take his first bite. A vegetarian all his life, he went to a restaurant with his cousin one day. His cousin -- who eats meat -- ordered a plate of butter chicken curry. ""It just looked so tempting,"" Merchant says. ""I took the first bite with a roti and I got used to it."" He's finally broken the news to his parents who maintain a strict vegetarian diet. His father tried to talk him out of his chicken eating ways but there's no going back for Merchant. ""I said it's part of my life.""","India is now one of the fastest growing markets for chicken in the world .

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands gained sweet revenge for defeat in the 2010 World Cup final by trouncing Spain 5-1 in the opening fixture of Group B in Salvador Friday. Xabi Alonso had given Spain the lead from the penalty spot after Diego Costa was brought down by Stefan de Vrij before Robin van Persie equalized with a brilliant diving header. Arjen Robben then fired the Dutch in front at the beginning of the second half before de Vrij atoned for his earlier foul on Brazil-born Costa to make it 3-1 just after the hour mark. A horrible error from Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas enabled van Persie to make it four after 72 minutes and Robben burst clear of the Spanish defense eight minutes later to round off the scoring. The result is Spain's worst at a World Cup finals in 64 years and leaves little room for error in the 2008 and 2012 European champion's remaining group games against Chile and Australia. The Dutch, meanwhile, will take great confidence having overcome the team that denied them in Johannesburg four years ago. The Netherlands employed a physical approach when the sides met that night in Soccer City and there was much of the same during the opening stages at the Arena Fonte Nova as the Dutch pressed early, creating the first clear chance for Wesley Sneijder -- whose shot was blocked by Casillas. Sneijder was made to regret his profligacy midway through the first half after Costa was felled in the area. The striker, who was born a few hundred miles north of Salvador and twice capped by Brazil in friendlies, was roundly booed by many of the local fans in attendance for switching his allegiance to Spain earlier this year. Alonso ignored the animosity directed towards his teammate from the stands, however, as he drilled his penalty low to the right of Jasper Cillessen. David Silva should have doubled Spain's lead shortly after being played through by 2010 match-winner Andres Iniesta but the Manchester City midfielder's delicate chip was slapped away by Cillessen. Moments later the Netherlands were level. Daley Blind's floated long pass was met on the run by van Persie and the striker launched a flying header that looped the ball brilliantly beyond Casillas. If that was a shock to the Spanish system, worse was to follow six minutes in to the second half as the Dutch took the lead. Another Blind crossfield pass found Robben galloping into the Spanish penalty area. The Bayern Munich star displayed a deft touch to control the ball before stepping inside Gerard Pique and clipping it beyond Casillas. Van Persie then rattled the Spanish crossbar with a ferocious strike from just outside the area, and five minutes later it was 3-1. De Vrij rose at the back post to bundle the ball over the line after Casillas could not claim Sneijder's free-kick. Things would soon get worse for the Spanish captain. His terribly heavy touch following a simple backpass from Jordi Alba enabled van Persie to steal the ball and slide it into an empty net to make it four. At this stage Dutch fans could have been excused for believing they were dreaming. But more was to follow as a now ragged Spain was picked off on the break. Robben displayed his searing pace to streak clear of Sergio Ramos after 80 minutes before rounding a despairing Casillas and blasting the ball high into the unguarded net. Spain, well beaten, looked lost -- a shadow of the side which has dominated international football for the last six years. The famous tiki-taka style that has been the team's hallmark throughout this golden period was rendered useless against a disciplined, well-organized and ruthless Dutch side. Substitute Fernando Torres had a late penalty claim turned down and then took too long to convert what appeared a simple chance from three yards out that would have reduced the deficit. The Chelsea striker's ineptitude in front of goal summed up Spain's performance perfectly. ""I did not expect that it would go this way, it could have been 6-1 or even more, and we had a very happy feeling,"" Dutch coach Louis van Gaal told reporters after the match. ""This is a nice start, but we have nothing. If we do not win our next game against Australia we have made no progress, but now we are obviously in a good position."" Cutting a more chastened figure was Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque who lamented his side's performance but refused to apportion any blame ahead of Wednesday's next match against Chile. ""We must recognize our mistakes, but everyone fought for a better result,"" Del Bosque told Spanish TV station Tele 5 after the match. ""I am aware that it is a very delicate time for us. Together we have to try to solve it for the next match against Chile and look for the win."" Chile 3-1 Australia . A win against the in-form South Americans is no certainty for Del Bosque's charges. Jorge Sampaoli's side looked impressive in spells against Australia, winning Group B's second fixture of the day at the Arena Pantanal in Cuiaba. Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring after 11 minutes for La Roja, pouncing on a loose ball to place it beyond Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from nine yards. Jorge Valdivia then made it two just over a minute later as he curled the ball delightfully beyond Ryan with the outside of his boot from the edge of the area, having been teed up by Sanchez. Veteran midfielder Tim Cahill pulled a goal back for the Socceroos with a trademark header after 35 minutes, and the New York Red Bulls player was denied by a smart save by Claudio Bravo shortly after. Cahill, who has now scored at three World Cups, had another header rightly chalked off for offside in the second half, but Chile always looked the more likely to score again. Alex Wilkinson cleared off the line from Eduardo Vargas after the Chilean striker had clipped the ball beyond the onrushing Ryan after 72 minutes. Substitute Jean Beausejour then ensured victory in stoppage time with a low strike from 25 yards that flew past Ryan. While no doubt frustrated by the loss, the Socceroos can take some solace from the fact that Spain's earlier collapse against the Netherlands ensures it is the reigning world champions who prop up Group B after the first round of fixtures. Mexico 1-0 Cameroon . In the day's first fixture, Mexico overcame Cameroon, the weather and some more questionable World Cup officiating to win its opening Brazil 2014 fixture. Oribe Peralta scored the only goal of the game just after the hour mark, rifling home after Cameroon goalkeeper Charles Itandje couldn't hold Giovanni Dos Santos' low shot. Two wrongly disallowed Dos Santos goals had earlier denied the Mexicans a halftime lead their enterprising performance deserved. Thursday's tournament opening fixture between Brazil and Croatia was marked by a controversial decision to award the host nation a penalty in the second half by Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura. But Peralta's strike ensured any controversy would be avoided and El Tri would triumph on a sodden afternoon in Natal. The win put Mexico second in Group A behind leaders Brazil which triumphed 3-1 on Thursday in Sao Paulo. Cameroon, unimpressive and soundly beaten, is third above Croatia on goal difference in the four-team group.","Netherlands wins 5-1 against world champion Spain .

"(CNN) -- He was one of a wave of American businessman to invest in an English Premier League club, but eight years down the line a weary Randy Lerner has beaten a retreat. Lerner completed a Â£62.6 million ($105.7 million) takeover of Aston Villa from Doug Ellis back in 2006 -- one year after Malcolm Glazer won control of Manchester United, and one year before Tom Hicks and George Gillett bought Liverpool. Yet despite enjoying early success at Villa Park with the club securing three straight sixth-place finishes under former manager Martin O'Neill, the 52-year-old has had to watch on in recent seasons as the team have struggled in the bottom half of the table. The former owner of NFL team, the Cleveland Browns hinted last month that he was considering his position amid reports that a sale was imminent. And he confirmed Monday that he has ""engaged Bank of America Merrill Lynch to advise on the club's sale"" as he seeks a much-needed break from the world of football. ""I have come to know well that fates are fickle in the business of English football,"" Lerner said in an official statement. ""The last several seasons have been week in, week out battles and having now come through this last season unfortunately limping amidst very meaningful injuries and constant sale rumors, I feel further that now is the time for me to look for new ownership and thus new leadership."" He added: ""On a personal level it is time for me, like the Shunammite, to dwell among my own and get on with other aspects of my career, following a sale."" Much of Villa's success under O'Neill was aided by Lerner's willingness to invest millions on new players, such as Ashley Young, James Milner and Stewart Downing. However, after ultimately being unable to break into the top four of the English Premier League and secure Champions League football, the American has had to embark on a cost-cutting program in recent seasons -- selling star players to rival clubs, including Young to Manchester United in 2011 and Milner to Manchester City in 2010. The team's decline has led to some criticism of both Lerner's running of the club as well as the managers who have followed O'Neill -- Gerard Houllier, Alex McLeish and Paul Lambert. Lerner, though, is still grateful for the backing he has received from the majority of the club's supporters, while he is hoping Villa will go from strength to strength after his departure. ""I am appreciative of the support I have received, even in these last years of comparative struggle when criticism was due, and will look on with others -- with fingers crossed, for stronger future performance appropriate to our size and heritage,"" he said. Lerner added: ""Above all, the debt I owe Aston Villa whether as owner, chairman, custodian or simply as a fan is to put the club first. To make good on that debt, I owe it to Villa to move on, and look for fresh, invigorated leadership, if in my heart I feel I can no longer do the job."" While Lerner thanked Lambert for his efforts as manager since arriving in 2012, he did not mention the Scot's future. Lambert may be disposed by the new owners following a disappointing season that culminated with the club finishing 15th. Lerner's likely asking price for the club will be in the region of Â£200 million ($337.7 million), according to reports in the British media.","Randy Lerner decides to put EPL side Aston Villa up for sale .

"(CNN) -- Mario Balotelli didn't score but, once again, it was still all about him. The Italian striker made his much anticipated reintroduction into English soccer Sunday when he started for Liverpool against Tottenham Hotspur. Liverpool ran out comfortable 3-0 winners with goals from Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and new signing Alberto Moreno. But before, during and after the game, all eyes were on the mercurial Balotelli, who showed flashes of both his brilliance and profligacy. On any other day he might have had a hat trick, but he missed his three clear cut chances in the first half. Rodgers impressed . Yet Balotelli's work rate and approach play on and off the ball impressed his new coach Brendan Rodgers. ""He is a good man and I think if you take away the circus around him, and the circus he invites himself sometimes, control the background noise and get him focused on his football, he'll make mistakes ... but he's going to be a real handful for defenders,"" Rodgers said after the game. Rodgers also revealed that Balotelli had never defended at a corner before coming to Liverpool. ""For the first time in his life he marked at a corner,"" Rodgers revealed. ""Serious. International player, won three titles, and we were doing corners and I said, 'are you picking up [opposition players] at the corners'. He said: 'I don't mark at corners.' You do now."" It was almost a dream debut for Balotelli but he managed to head the ball straight at Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal. But Rodgers' new system, with Balotelli and Daniel Sturridge up front and Raheem Sterling playing behind, paid dividends. In fact it was Sterling who broke the deadlock when he scored at the near post following a Jordan Henderson cross from the right hand side. A Steven Gerrard penalty and a stunning Alberto Moreno strike made sure of the points and ensured Balotelli's return to English football was a winning one. Arsenal stutter . Later in the day Arsenal continued their indifferent Premier League form with a 1-1 draw against Leicester City. With the transfer window about to shut, Arsenal's depth of forward options had been under scrutiny before the game. But it was one of coach Arsene Wenger's big summer signings, Alexis Sanchez, who put Arsenal ahead before Leicester City equalized through a Leo Ulloa header. Arsenal had 24 chances during the match but couldn't break down a team who were promoted from English soccer's second tier last season. ""Tough, tough,"" Wenger told Sky Sports after the draw. ""A draw was fair. We didn't play well enough. We lacked a bit of creativity. We've had two tough weeks, three away games. It is not an excuse, but we are a bit jaded. In the end we could have lost it."" Balotelli signs for Liverpool .","Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 .

"(CNN) -- One country's dusty backyard is another country's dream vacation, according to Google's 2013 year-in-review list. Published Tuesday, the Zeitgeist charts reveal the hottest travel destinations by country. The data is divided into two kinds of lists. The first reflects the ""trending"" destinations -- those that show the greatest growth in searches when compared to last year -- while the second shows rankings of topics with the largest total search volumes. Google is the world's most popular search engine, with 71% of the global search engine market share. The roundup yielded some surprising results -- Macau was the most searched destination in India this year, for example. In Australia the top destination was Disneyland, despite the fact that the closest Magical Kingdom is an ocean away in Hong Kong. London topped the destination searches in the United Arab Emirates, while those in the UK were planning trips to Rome and New York. More: The world's best city is ... Zeitgeist also analyzed the top destination wedding and honeymoon searches coming from the United States. American couples wanted to head to the warm waters of Mexico, Bahamas and Kauai for their weddings, while New Zealand topped their honeymoon searches. Croatia rounded out the top 10 honeymoon list. True value . ""This info is gold if you want to really know what the local hotspots are,"" says Google spokesperson Joyce Hau. ""For instance, what island destination is the most popular amongst Thais in Thailand? Hint: it's not Koh Samui."" It's actually Koh Larn. Despite having only a 3% market share in China, Google's study also looked at search queries there. Hangzhou and Suzhou were declared of greatest interest to travelers. China will soon become the world's largest domestic travel market and account for 40% of all outbound Asian travelers according to a new study by the Boston Consulting Group.

"(Cosmopolitan) -- So it's over, huh? I'm sorry. Here are some books to feed your heart and keep your brain/hands busy so you don't pour yourself a big glass of Jose Cuervo and battery acid. 1. ""Him, Her, Him Again, The End of Him"" by Patricia Marx . Seriously. Read this. Realizing that the guy you've wasted time on for years is a vacuous, pretentious douche nugget is actually kind of funny, and Marx proves it. A satirist who writes for the New Yorker, she's confessed that the book -- about an unnamed, neurotic college girl who spends 10 years pining for a pretentious PhD student -- is based on her own experience with her own unnamed douche nugget, which is probably why it feels SO right. Cosmopolitan: 10 Ways to Finally Get Over Him . 2. ""This Is How You Lose Her"" by Junot Diaz . The lovelorn main character routinely screws over the women he's dating, but you can't help but like him a little bit, since he's one of those inimitable Diaz protagonists. It's snappy and fun to read, and the final story will remind you that men need to realize they're assholes before they become non-assholes, which sometimes takes awhile. 3. ""Ethan Frome"" by Edith Wharton . A departure from Wharton's normal New York society jam, this sad-as-hell stark and beautiful novella is about a man with a sickly wife living in a small town who falls for her pretty young caretaker. It does not end well. People have worse lives than you. Now go change out of those sweatpants, muchacha. Cosmopolitan: 24 Things Not to Say to a Girl Who's Been Cheated On . 4. ""I Don't Care About Your Band"" by Julie Klausner . I'll let Ms. Klausner, a comedian and successful podcaster, sell this for you. ""As a kid, I took my cues from [Miss] Piggy, chasing every would-be Kermit in my vicinity with porcine voracity and what I thought was feminine charm. Remember how content Kermit was, just strumming his banjo on a tree trunk in the swamp? That's the guy I've chased my whole life, killing myself trying to show him how fabulous I am. Kermit never appreciated what he had in Piggy, because she was just one great thing about his awesome life. I wonder how many guys from my generation looked to Kermit as an example of what the coolest guy in the room looks like. How maybe they think it's fine to defer the advances of the fabulous women they know will always be there, while they dreamily pursue creative endeavors and dabble with other contenders."" GAH, IT'S JUST SO GOOD. Cosmopolitan: A Complete Valentine's Day Schedule for a Single Woman . 5. ""Monica's Story"" by Andrew Morton . Yes, that Monica. You might feel like it's confusing that this book is on the list, but not only is it ""Scandal""-level entertainment (and real life!), you also look back at the 1998 scandal in a totally different way than you might have. She was 22 and infatuated with a manipulative married man. Sure, he also happened to be the most powerful guy in the free world, but the story is more relatable than you might think. I felt stuff. 6. ""Dolores Claiborne"" by Stephen King . Not for the faint-hearted. A blue-collar housekeeper in a police station, being questioned about the murder of her longtime employer, an eccentric and wealthy elderly woman -- and that's just where it starts. The heart of Dolores' story is the actions she takes when her drunk, abusive husband rapes their young daughter. It's a chilling book but showcases the resilience of women, even those trapped in unbearable circumstances, in a really powerful way. Cosmopolitan: What Guys Say Versus What They Really Mean . 7. ""Winesburg, Ohio"" by Sherwood Anderson . Connected tales of a small town and its residents, who are mostly lonely and sexually repressed. Not as bleak as ""Ethan Frome,"" but similar deal, except the female characters are more human and complex. 8. ""The Position"" by Meg Wolitzer . This novel tracks a suburban family, whose mother and father published a ""The Joy of Sex""-style book of sex positions with paintings of themselves as the models, over a period of about 20 years. The book became a cult success, and their children (two girls and two boys) grow up in its shadow. It depicts adult relationships in a very realistic but still interesting, way -- and the character of Holly, the older girl, is fascinating. Cosmopolitan: 9 Things He Doesn't Want You to Know . 9. ""Random Family: Love, Drugs, Trouble and Coming of Age In The Bronx"" by Adrian Nicole LeBlanc . This sprawling reported non-fiction book is so absorbing that you'll forget about all your problems. LeBlanc, a journalist, captures the tiniest aspects of the lives of two teenage Puerto Rican girls as they grow up in a bad neighborhood, have kids young, and one ends up in prison for working as a mill girl for her flashy heroin-dealing boyfriend. (At the end of the book, they're in their late twenties and mid-thirties; LeBlanc spent 10 years basically living with their families.) But LeBlanc doesn't condescend to the women, nor does she criticize their choices. She simply observes and reports, and her dedication shows that she truly cares about breaking the cycle of poverty. 10. ""How Did You Get This Number"" by Sloane Crosley . Crosley is like your smartest, funniest female friend, who articulates all the delights and inconveniences about being a young, ambitious woman in a big city that you've always felt but never known how to explain it. The last essay, ""Off the Back of a Truck,"" is about Crosley's relationship with a guy who secretly had another long-term girlfriend at the same time. The girlfriend eventually finds Crosley in the guy's phone (under ""Doug"") and calls her. It's really rough, and it articulates the steps of breakups in a way that will confirm you're not insane for wanting to smack everyone who asks, ""How long were you dating?""

"Washington (CNN) -- Supap Kirtsaeng had tuition and living expenses to pay when he arrived in the United States from Thailand to attend college. So he started a side business, asking family and friends back home to ship him foreign editions of textbooks that often can be bought more cheaply overseas. Kirtsaeng resold them online and made money, but he was sued for copyright infringement and lost. That decision was appealed and the case is now before the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Monday in a dispute that has attracted interest from the Obama administration, media and publishing companies, and a range of consumer and retail groups. Competing claims of intellectual property and owners rights in the electronic age have made Kirtsaeng's venture one of the most closely watched business cases at the high court this term. ""I have to say the Supreme Court is faced with a really difficult job here because the text of the [copyright] statute really seems to be hard to reconcile -- the two provisions at issue seem to say opposite things,"" said Michael Carroll, a professor at American University's law school and an intellectual property expert. Corporate giants to yard sales . The legal issue is whether copyrighted works made and purchased abroad can then be bought and sold within the United States without the copyright owner's permission. Yet the stakes could prove enormous for those who buy and sell books, movies, music, artwork, perhaps even furniture, electronics, automobiles, and clothing -- anything that may be considered ""intellectual property."" Storefront and at-home secondary retailers, libraries, artistic venues, even the local garage sale could be implicated. Kirtsaeng came to the United States to study mathematics in 1997 at Cornell University and later at the University of Southern California for doctoral studies. Using the computer tag BlueChristine99, he sold the imported books online in the United States on eBay. Court records show he earned about $1.2 million in revenue, but both sides disagree over how much profit he made. Specifically he sold dozens of copies of eight textbooks printed in Asia by a subsidiary of John Wiley & Sons publishers. Kirtsaeng's lawyers claim his gross revenue from the Wiley sales was just $37,000. The company sued and a federal jury found Kirtsaeng's conduct was willful and ordered him to pay $600,000 in damages. The New Jersey publisher has a thriving overseas business. Its foreign editions typically have a disclaimer: ""This book is authorized for sale in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East only and may not be exported. Exportation from or importation of this book to another region without the publisher's authorization is illegal."" The high court will consider the limits of two key interpretations of copyright law -- the ""first sale doctrine"" and its complex relationship to foreign distribution rights. The arcane language can be dense but the justices are expected to use their questioning at the oral argument to zero in on competing principles and whether one overrides the other. The first-sale doctrine generally gives copyright holders the ability to profit only from the original sale. It essentially means once you the consumer lawfully buy a Peter Max lithograph or an Adele music CD in the United States, you then can sell that copyrighted work in the United States without punishment and without having to compensate the original copyright holder. It ensures a distribution chain of retail items, library lending, gift giving, and rentals for a range of intellectual property. That stream of commerce includes secondary markets like flea markets and online resellers Craigslist and eBay. 'You bought it, you own it' The idea -- upheld by the Supreme Court since 1908 -- is that once a copyright holder legally sells a product initially, the ownership claim is then exhausted, giving the buyer the power to resell, destroy, donate, whatever. It's a limited idea -- involving only a buyer's distribution right, not the power to reproduce that DVD or designer dress for sale. ""The rule we want the Supreme Court to adopt is simple: you bought it, you own it and you can do with it what you please. Very clear, very clean, very easy,"" said Andrew Shore, a lawyer and executive director of the Owners Rights Initiative, which is supporting the bookseller. ""The copyright holders are getting paid, they're getting paid on the first sale."" The tricky part is whether that first-sale doctrine applies to material both manufactured and first purchased outside the United States. Federal law gives that authority to a purchaser's work ""lawfully made under this title."" Does ""this title"" apply to any copyrighted work -- whether manufactured all or in part in the United States and around the world? Wiley argues it readily sells its products overseas at a cheaper price -- particularly to countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America -- to satisfy an audience that may have less income than in the States or Europe. ""We're going to help the global economy with this,"" said Theodore Olson, an attorney with Gibson Dunn hired by the publisher. ""The whole idea of the copyright laws is to provide people with an incentive to create books, movies, or other works of art. If you take away that incentive, you're not going to have creators out there doing things that give us pleasure or educate us."" Such differences in worldwide prices are often exploited by retail and resale firms, especially on high-end luxury and specialized items. Known as parallel sales or the ""gray market"" -- foreign-made goods obtained through secondhand sources -- the strategy costs manufacturers tens of billions of dollars a year, according to some business-generated estimates. Olson will argue a 1978 congressional law gives publishers protection when they sell their works at differing prices in foreign markets, preventing their importation and resale into the United States. A federal appeals court in New York agreed, ruling last year such ""gray market"" items are not subject to the first-sale mandate. The high court already has ruled in prior cases that copyright holders cannot block U.S.-made goods sent overseas from later being brought back into the United States for resale. The issue now is whether copyright laws apply to foreign-made goods imported into the American market. Slippery slope? But Kirtsaeng and his owners rights supporters worry a slippery slope would quickly occur on a variety of fronts, if they lose at the Supreme Court: . --Domestic manufacturers would have financial incentive to shut down U.S. plants and produce everything overseas, since they could get a monetary cut and distribution control over every resale. Kirtsaeng's lawyers say that amounts to double-dipping, with copyright holders getting paid twice for the same item's sale. --Libraries would have to either purge their stacks of every foreign-printed work, pay a royalty, or essentially go out of the public lending service. --American consumers would lose access to affordable and differentiated goods, and charitable donations would be stifled. --With a global consumer economy now dominated by digital and cloud-based access and transfer of information and entertainment, the cross-border lines would create chaos and uncertainty when it comes to determining where a particular copyrighted good is manufactured and then resold. Wiley, with the Justice Department in support, dismiss those scenarios, and say Congress would be in a position to ensure libraries in particular do not suffer from any high court ruling against them. The entertainment industry says a ruling in their favor is vital in the digital economy to ensure they can divide their property and distribution rights across those global markets. As for Kirtsaeng, he is a professor back in Thailand and never responded to CNN's efforts for an interview. He initially testified receiving advice from friends back home and also consulting ""Google Answers,"" an online research help service to ensure he could legally resell the foreign editions in the United States. In court papers, he also stated being unable to afford paying the hefty, pending judgment against him. The man's lawyers say after the initial verdict, he was ordered to give the publisher his golf clubs and computer in partial compensation. The case is Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc (11-697). A ruling is expected in coming months. CNN's Joe Johns and Ted Metzger contributed to this report.","Case involving student who resold books bought overseas is a major copyright test .

"(CNN) -- Pete Jackson attended his brother-in-law's funeral along with his daughter, Emily, six years ago. He never dreamed it would be the last day of his daughter's life. ""It's so tragic, just not something you would never, ever expect,"" said Pete Jackson. Instead of going home to the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights after the funeral, Emily Jackson, 18, spent the night with her cousins. That night, she made a deadly decision. She took an Oxycontin -- a single prescription pill -- that her cousin offered to her while drinking. She went to sleep that night and never woke up. She died of respiratory depression -- she simply stopped breathing. The Oxycontin that Emily took belonged to her uncle, who had died of cancer. While taking one pill and dying is rare, dying accidentally after using painkillers inappropriately is common. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one person dies from a drug overdose every 19 minutes. About 28,754 Americans died after accidentally overdosing on legal or illegal drugs in 2009, according to the CDC; about half of those deaths involved prescription painkillers. Those numbers are significant enough to make prescription drugs one of the leading causes of accidental death in this county. It's a statistic that has led some experts to call prescription drug abuse an epidemic. Gupta: Let's end the prescription drug death epidemic . ""If you asked any guy on the street what the leading cause of accidental death is, they would guess gunshot or car accident,"" said Tom McLellan, co-founder of the Treatment Research Institute, a nonprofit organization advocating for improvements in substance abuse policies. ""They would never imagine it's pharmaceutical opioids (painkillers)."" John Castellani -- the president and CEO of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents and lobbies on behalf of drug manufacturers -- said America's problem with prescription drugs is unacceptable. But he insisted the drugs are safe when used as recommended. ""The problem we're dealing with with prescription drug abuse is having to balance those patients (who abuse prescription drugs) and those millions of patients that benefit from these medicines because they have a need that they and their physicians have recognized,"" Castellani said. Emily Jackson was on the road to recovery after a 2002 diagnosis of thyroid cancer and undergoing three surgeries to fight it. She and her cousin had done ""a bit of drinking"" the night she died, Pete Jackson said. But he is sure that had she not taken the Oxycontin, she would still be alive today. ""I've never tried to make it sound like Emily is innocent,"" Jackson said. ""What I want people to understand about Emily's tragedy is how easily this can happen, how dangerous these drugs are."" 'You play Russian roulette' The prescription painkiller Emily Jackson took is a respiratory depressant that slows breathing. That in combination with the alcohol, another respiratory depressant, overwhelmed her brain, which stopped giving her heart and lungs the signal to keep functioning. ""In many ways, you play Russian roulette,"" said Kathleen Meyers, a senior researcher for the Treatment Research Institute, who added that adolescents and young adults are particularly at risk because they feel invincible. ""You have no idea the (respiratory) consequences of any one group of substances, and then you put all that together and the risks go up exponentially."" It's not just an issue among teenagers. In fact, rates of accidental overdose among teens, while still a major public health problem, are actually going down. This problem spans many demographics. Gupta: The truth about prescription medication addiction . In fact, males in their 40s and 50s who start off with a prescription for back pain and die from an accidental overdose several years later are dying in significant numbers. ""Could you imagine, a worker that popped their back, and we started to put them on (pain) medication and three years later they were dead?"" Dr. Alex Cahana, the chief of pain medicine at the University of Washington, told CNN. ""That's devastating."" The devastation began for Steve Rummler when he got a prescription for nerve pain radiating through his leg and back. It started when he was 28. For the next nine years, the Minneapolis man endured the pain. It was not until 2005, when Rummler was 37, that a doctor prescribed hydrocodone to address his pain, along with clonazepam, a benzodiazepine and anti-anxiety medication, to relieve his injury-related anxiety. Family members said it was the first time in nearly a decade Rummler felt relief from the life-altering pain he endured. But that relief was short-lived. In a journal entry, Rummler said of the drugs, ""At first they were a lifeline. Now they are a noose around my neck."" It is a common sentiment, and a common scenario, according to Meyers, who says Rummler's case is far too common -- a person genuinely needs opioids but becomes addicted to the relief they provide. ""The person that is on them for legitimate reasons and the kid who experiments with them seem very different, but the outcome is the same,"" said Meyers. ""And they are very difficult to get off of. I think we probably need to do a better job of pain management in this country."" By 2009, Rummler had sunk into dependence and, eventually, into addiction. At the advice of his family, he enrolled in two addiction treatment programs and seemingly had a handle on his addiction. But in July of 2011, just 45 days after completing the final stage of his rehabilitation, Rummler relapsed and died at 43. Rummler still had outstanding prescriptions for hydrocodone and clonazepam at the time of his death, and empty prescription bottles were in his house when the police arrived. His official cause of death was mixed drug toxicity caused by opiates and benzodiazepines. A medical investigator said there was no way to tell what Rummler ingested immediately before his death. Like Emily Jackson, Rummler stopped breathing in his sleep. Gupta: More is not always better in medicine . Experts: Better communication needed . Accidental prescription drug overdoses is ""the only epidemic that I know that has been recognized by the DEA, FDA, CDC and the White House Office of Drug Control,"" McLellan said. Meyers and McLellan believe the key to combating accidental deaths related to prescription drugs is creating a better dialogue among doctors, patients and pharmacies. ""When someone is given prednisone, a steroid commonly used to treat inflammatory diseases, they are given very specific instructions,"" said Meyers. ""They are very direct about what will happen if the patient misuses it. You don't see that with pain medication. ""Maybe if we did a better job with how we communicate the effects of prescription medications when you don't take them the way they are prescribed or if you mix other substances with them, maybe we wouldn't have the number of people who are in crisis,"" she added. After co-founding the Treatment Research Institute, McLellan worked as the deputy director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy for the Obama administration. One of his main tasks was combating the epidemic of prescription drug abuse. McLellan says he believes everyone throughout the supply chain of opioids needs to take greater responsibility. This means pharmaceutical companies would carefully monitor and control the supply they produce, he said. Doctors would be more rigorous with patient screening -- including, possibly, urinalysis exams before issuing or extending a prescription. Patients would be more careful about the storing and disposal of their medications along with how they take them. And, most importantly, pharmacies would keep a watchful eye on all of the substances each of their customers takes, he said. ""You don't want to stop the use of opioids, because that would be stupid, but you need better management,"" he said. ""Information exchange is the main thing; pharmacies have to know what everyone is getting prescribed."" Meanwhile, people such as Pete Jackson are left to deal with the aftermath of prescription drug abuse. After his daughter's death, Jackson began researching what he could do to prevent a similar tragedy from striking another household. In 2007, Jackson joined forces with other bereaved families to create Advocates for the Reform of Prescription Opioids, a group dedicated to advancing the dialogue around prescription drugs and the legislation concerning them. ""It's just so frustrating when you're operating in an arena where there's always a presumption of guilt,"" Jackson said. ""This isn't about (Emily) being guilty or what kind of person she was. It happens that she was the most wonderful person I've ever known. It's really about how we can address this problem.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- ""Lift the siege."" ""Stop the rockets."" The dialogue of the deaf continues after nearly three weeks of conflict and well over 700 deaths. Hamas has rejected one Egyptian proposal to silence the guns. It wants assurances that any deal includes an end to the blockade that has wrecked Gaza's economy and impoverished its people. No, says Israel: stop firing rockets and then we'll talk about it. Hamas is a resilient organization. Fighters of its military wing have put up stiff resistance to the Israeli ground incursion. But it has few friends in the Arab world, and the Arab street has not risen in solidarity. And this time, Israeli leaders are publicly and persistently demanding what they call the 'demilitarization' of Gaza as the price for peace - so that Israel is spared another barrage of rockets like those that fell on its soil in 2008 and 2012 - and are again now. To that end Israel wants to ensure that Hamas can acquire neither the raw materials it needs to make thousands more rockets nor get its hands on more advanced missiles. It is also determined to eradicate the maze of tunnels that Hamas uses to support its infrastructure and infiltrate the border. Israeli military officers say they believe most if not all the tunnels have been identified -- more than 60 access shafts leading to some 31 tunnels as of Thursday. In other words the Israeli aim is a lasting change in the landscape. The U.S. and European Union have warmed to the idea. ""One of the results, one would hope, of a cease-fire would be some form of demilitarization, so that again, this doesn't continue,"" said U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken. So how do you define 'demilitarization?' What sort of weapons does it include? Who guarantees and polices it? Is it even conceivable Hamas would give up in negotiation an arsenal it has spent years building up? Khaled Mashal -- leader of Hamas political wing -- insisted Tuesday: ""Nobody can break the will of the resistance and no one can get rid of its weapons. Only two conditions can get rid of the weapons of the resistance -- firstly the ending of the occupation and second the demilitarization of Israel."" Obviously impossible demands, but Nathan Thrall, senior analyst with the Middle East Program of the International Crisis Group, says ""there's no way Hamas will ever accept demilitarization in exchange for changes in Gaza."" Is there a halfway house which would provide Israel with sufficient security guarantees? Nothing yet on the horizon. The trouble for Hamas is that its main ally, Egypt's former President Mohamed Morsy, is now in jail. And the man who ousted him, President Abdel Fattah al Sisi, has moved to isolate Hamas, economically and militarily, by closing the smuggling tunnels into Gaza. Crudely put, he shares Israel's view that Hamas is ruining the neighborhood. So Egypt is in the driving seat, as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has recognized by making Cairo the first port of call in his latest shuttle. His 'phone-bashing' has been intense -- bringing in Israel, the Palestinians, Qatar, France, the Turkish Foreign Minister and more. But one of his predecessors, Madeleine Albright, told CNN that one problem was working out ""who has any influence over Hamas in order to get them to accept a cease-fire."" For Hamas any deal must include what it calls the ""lifting of the siege"" -- the blockade of Gaza that has turned it into an open prison for the last eight years. ""We will not accept any proposal that does not lift the blockade,"" said Mashal. A truce in Gaza perhaps, but he would not agree to a lasting cease-fire unless blockade terms had been negotiated. At issue then, how can each side get enough to wave in front of their people as victory? And what's the sequence: truce, then negotiations, and only then a full cease-fire? The whispers and hints suggest so. Hamas is wary of being trapped like it was in 2012, when a truce was agreed but longer-term issues never resolved. Hamas is aware that above all the people of Gaza are gasping for the chance to breathe a more normal life. ""We would rather be dead than live this life."" CNN correspondents in Gaza have heard that and similar refrains time and again. The detailed terms of any opening of Gaza will probably not be agreed as part of an initial truce. There are too many questions. Who monitors the border crossing with Egypt at Rafah? The U.N.? The Egyptian military? Israeli officials seem ready at least to consider a force from the Palestinian Authority, says Nathan Thrall of the ICG. And he believes that Israel ""may be moving -- albeit grudgingly -- towards accepting a reconciliation government among the Palestinians that allows Abbas' Palestinian Authority to regain a foothold in Gaza,"" not least because Egypt will only talk to Abbas. What sort of goods would be allowed in from Israel into Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing, which handles freight? Israel complains that most of the cement smuggled into Gaza in recent years from Egypt (and some allowed in from Israel) has been used for Hamas tunnels -- not houses. What about the port of Gaza? There are other issues -- including the release of Hamas supporters arrested in the West Bank since the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers last month and the ability of farmers to tend land along the fringes of Gaza. Fishing rights of Palestinians in Gaza would also likely be discussed. Some in the Israeli Defense Forces have expressed surprise at the scale and intensity of the resistance they have met and the extent of the tunnel network, dubbed by one Israeli official as ""Lower Gaza."" Rather than prod the Israeli government towards a cease-fire, the resistance may make it more determined to degrade Hamas' capabilities for a while longer. Sisi has no problem with that. But a deeper invasion into Gaza is fraught with peril, says Nathan Thrall. The Israelis, he notes, are just one kilometer inside Gaza and taking much heavier casualties than they did in 2008-09. Hamas is not without friends altogether. The wealthy emirate of Qatar is close to the Muslim Brotherhood, from which Hamas sprang, and has embarked on a diplomatic drive with Turkey to bring peace and reconstruction to Gaza. But Turkey's Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has made incendiary comparisons between Israel's conduct in Gaza and Hitler -- and described the incursion as ""systematic genocide,"" ruling himself out of any role as the region's 'honest broker.' And Israeli ministers see Qatar as complicit in bankrolling Hamas. One long-term proposal that was floated before the latest conflict involves the international community demilitarizing Gaza in return for massive investment -- 50 billion dollars -- in the territory. It comes from a former Israeli Defense Minister, Shaul Mofaz. ""People say demilitarization is unrealistic, but the alternatives of going through this again in a year or two or capturing Gaza are unacceptable,"" Mofaz told the Jerusalem Post. [Palestinian President Mahmoud] ""Abbas would be in a better position if he came into Gaza with $50 billion than if he was brought in on an IDF tank,"" Mofaz said. He's looking to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to lead that process. Few believe the Palestinian Authority has the resources to administer such a Marshall Plan. Such an ambitious vision seems far away right now, almost impossible, some say. American officials say they are focused on the next days, not weeks nor months nor years. ""Right now our focus is on stopping the rocket fire so that we can begin a serious negotiation on the key issues. What we're trying to figure out is how do we get to a point where the violence can stop and these bigger, key issues can be addressed over the long term,"" said a senior U.S. official. Writing in Foreign Policy, Aaron David Miller is deeply pessimistic about the long term. ""When it comes to Gaza,"" he says, ""don't dream about demilitarization or economic miracles. In fact, forget the endgame. Right now, summoning the urgency, the right mediator, and a deal to stop the killing will be hard enough."" But that's what the people of Gaza most desperately need -- before they can even dream of greater freedoms.","The Gaza conflict has lasted almost three weeks with over 700 deaths .

"(CNN) -- Imagine if it were possible to build your own home, in this day and age, for less than $35,000. Or to cut up some timber and piece your new home together like a giant jigsaw puzzle. What if you could create, with your own hands, a home that collects its own rainwater and generates its own power, so you never have to pay a bill again? As far-fetched as it sounds, if you can't afford to buy a house, then designing and building your own may be more viable than you assumed. Today, upcoming architects and designers are coming up with solutions to the problem of rocketing property prices, by building houses of their own and sharing their plans on the internet. In the UK, a young architectural practice has devised the world's first 'open-source' building. Made of simple materials and freely available plans, the 'WikiHouse' was conceived by English designer Alastair Parvin as a low-cost solution to the global housing shortage. The aim of the project is to allow anyone in the world to design, share, download, adapt and 'print' a house that is inexpensive and tailored to their own needs. Construction of the house requires no special parts and the entire building can be made from pieces of timber that snap together. According to its inventors, the frame of the WikiHouse can be assembled in under a day, by people with absolutely no construction training. Using a CNC machine, amateur builders can download cutting files from the company's website and then ""print"" the component parts of the WikiHouse from a sheet of plywood. Parvin says that the motivation for designing cheap, easy-to-build housing was to help make architecture more accessible. ""The open secret is that in reality almost everything we today call architecture is actually design for the 1%,"" Parvin says. ""The challenge facing the next generation of architects is how, for the first time, we will make our client not the 1% but the 100% -- to radically democratize the production of architecture."" For Parvin, spreading affordable housing requires the empowerment of amateurs. ""We are moving into a future where the factory can be everywhere -- and increasingly the design team can be everyone. We need to build tools and institutions for the social economy -- the 'long tail' of people who are making for themselves,"" Parvin says. This same spirit is present in Dominic Stevens' grassroots project 'Irish Vernacular', in which he built a home for $33,200. Stevens documented his efforts to create his house online to inspire others who might wish to follow his lead. The blog features comprehensive photography and information on the building process, plus professional plans and cartoon instructions that are simple enough for almost anyone to follow. Stevens' self-built home is a stunningly impressive three bedroom house that looks like it's been ripped from the pages of Wallpaper magazine. The building's bright living spaces and high quality finish belie its low price. According to Stevens, the house was primarily made from timber, and its roof is clad with a lightweight corrugated material called onduline. The house was largely constructed by a small group of Stevens' friends over the course of a long weekend (plus a little extra time to get the project finalized). After sharing his plans online, Stevens says that he received significant interest from people hoping to build their own home. ""By sharing my plans, I hope that it might be inspirational to people who have the skills, or will, or wish to put their own house together."" Stevens has also found that making his plans publicly available has actually stimulated his business. ""I think if you open up and submit to sharing things, you get it all back,"" he says. Craig Strachan, Development Director at the National Self Build Association warns that not everyone will necessarily be able to build their own home: ""Dominic Stevens' project is inspiring -- a fantastic home created for a fraction of the usual cost, however the time and energy required to do this make it difficult for the 'average person' to undertake."" Seeking a cheaper lifestyle and a more ecological existence, Simon Dale built his own 'Hobbit House' in Wales back in 2009 for just $4,600 (Â£3,000). Dale says the whole building was constructed with a hammer, a one-inch chisel and a chainsaw, and was made largely of scavenged materials. Dale says ""Anything you could possibly want is in a rubbish pile somewhere -- windows, burner, plumbing, wiring."" Dale, who has no training as a builder, built his eco-home with the help of a few friends and family members. The eco-home uses water from a nearby stream, and is heated by a wood burning stove with wood gathered from the surrounding forests. The property has a compost toilet, and is powered by solar panels on the roof. Famous architects have also been turning their minds to the global housing crisis. Renzo Piano, the designer of the Shard -- London's tallest building -- recently unveiled a working model for the 'Diogene' -- the smallest scale project he has ever mounted, which attempts to create a functional micro home that is fully featured but at an economical scale. Renzo Piano's Diogene house is designed to function self-sufficiently. Water is collected by the house, then cleaned and reused. The house also generates its own power through solar panels mounted on the roof. Architecture critic Hubertus Adam says that Piano's design addresses many of the housing crisis's central problems: ""We live in an age in which the demand for sustainability forces us to minimize our ecological footprint. This is paired with the desire to concentrate and reduce the direct living environment to the truly essential things."" Strachan says that individuals building their own houses may be critical to the future of home ownership: ""self build and custom build offer people a real alternative to buying a new home, and allows them to define the environment in which they live. Most projects use local labor and materials which helps stimulate the economy around them.""","Makers around the world develop low-cost solutions to global housing shortage .

"(CNN) -- After 35 years away, British singer Kate Bush returned to the stage Tuesday night -- and the response was rapturous. ""There was something thrilling about seeing the often bonkers but still delightful imagination of Bush run free after all this time,"" wrote Bernadette McNulty in the UK Telegraph about the show at London's Eventim Apollo, which included giant paper airplanes, reptilian monsters and sets with odd perspectives. Novelist David Mitchell (""Cloud Atlas"") contributed some of the narrative. ""She moves with a lithe grace, clearly still drawing on the mime training she underwent as a teenager forty years on. Her voice too is in remarkable condition: she's note-perfect throughout,"" wrote Alexis Petridis in the Guardian. ""The most ambitious piece of theatrical pop ever seen on a British stage,"" noted the Independent. The show, titled ""Before the Dawn,"" has been hotly anticipated for months. The 77,000 tickets, for a run of 22 concerts, sold out in minutes back in March. Fans are coming from all over the world to see her -- and, in some cases, paying dearly for the privilege. Among those in attendance: David Gilmour (who helped get her career started), Bjork, Lily Allen and actress Gemma Arterton. The first-day visitors were glad they came. ""It was just hypnotic,"" one spectator told the Telegraph. ""Kate Bush last night was phenomenal, one of the best shows I've ever seen,"" wrote singer Anna Calvi on Twitter. The show wasn't without its complaints -- mainly over a request to not use smartphones. ""(Personnel) are patrolling for phones in a very intense way,"" noted the Guardian in a live blog. Bush is known for her acrobatic voice and expansive, thoughtful albums, that have sometimes come out years apart -- which only makes her fans more frantic in anticipation. In the U.S., she's probably best known for the 1985 album ""Hounds of Love,"" which contained the single ""Running Up That Hill,"" and her duet with Peter Gabriel, ""Don't Give Up,"" which appeared on Gabriel's 1986 album ""So."" She has been reluctant to perform live for a number of reasons. There have been rumors of stage fright and fear of flying. She became a mother and wanted to raise her son, Bertie (who was a key supporter in bringing her back, she wrote in the show program.)

"(CNN) -- Born a man, Fallon Fox became a woman through surgery and then trained to fight in mixed martial arts. Now that she has won her first two MMA bouts -- both in the first round -- she has gone public as a transgender fighter, the first on record in a popular sport that some consider as the successor to boxing. ""The reaction has been positive,"" said Fox, 37, who revealed her story recently to Sports Illustrated after a journalist with another publication began to investigate her private surgery. ""It's just some people, some of society doesn't get it yet. And this is what we're trying to do now is to inform people and let them know about transgender athletes."" When asked if it's fair for a man-turned-woman fighter to face another woman in the ring, Fox said Saturday there were ""no unfair competitive advantages."" What was unfair, her last opponent and her manager say, is how Fox didn't disclose until after the fight that Fox had a sex change operation. That opponent, Ericka Newsome, was knocked out this month with ""a tie clinch,"" or a knee to the chin, 39 seconds into the fight without anyone knowing of Fox's background. It was ""unfair I didn't know it, but it didn't matter that she fought me,"" Newsome told CNN. ""I feel that it should have been disclosed to me ahead of time...so we are aware and able to be better prepared for the situation."" She and her manager are going to appeal the loss in Florida on the grounds of how Fox failed to disclose being a transgender person and how the referee stopped the fight too early. ""They should have let the fight go,"" manager Matt Hamilton said. ""She should have thrown at least one to two more shots to confirm it. On that particular basis, that's one of the things we'll appeal with, as well as not having it disclosed."" Meanwhile, the California State Athletic Commission is reviewing a claim by Fox that the state gave her a fighting license in 2013 when in fact the commission says her license application is still being reviewed, Sports Illustrated reported. Transgender fighter looking to get licensed . Fox subsequently told Florida authorities that she had a California license, and now the Florida boxing commission is also reviewing Fox's license application, the magazine reported. Also, Fox admitted she didn't disclose to boxing authorities she is a transgender person but added she wasn't asked to either, the magazine said. Sports Illustrated writer Loretta Hunt wrote of Fox's 2006 gender reassignment surgery and winning her pro debut in May 2012. Hunt told CNN that guidelines for the Association of Boxing Commissions are similar to the International Olympic Committee's policy that allows transsexuals to compete in Olympic games. The IOC requires transgender athletes to undergo hormone therapy long enough to remove gender-related advantages. In fact, Hunt said, mixed martial arts guidelines don't require a sex-change surgery, but they do require two years of hormone therapy for transgender fighters. ""Whether it comes after the surgery or it's just on its own, that must be done and you must be tested throughout the two years,"" Hunt said. ""Those papers must be submitted to the athletic commission for review."" Newsome wants to fight Fox again, Hamilton said. ""We would love a rematch,"" Hamilton said.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Citing safety concerns and the organization's history, Georgia transportation officials said Tuesday they would not allow a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan to ""adopt"" a one-mile stretch of highway in North Georgia. The Klan chapter wanted to clean a stretch of Georgia State Route 515 in Union County, Georgia, according to paperwork obtained by CNN. The application was filed by the International Keystone Knights of the KKK on May 21. Keith Golden, commissioner for the state Department of Transportation, wrote the chapter's secretary that officials determined the mountain roadway, with a speed limit of 65 mph, was not a safe place for cleanup volunteers to work. Golden's letter to April Chambers cited other concerns. ""The impact of erecting a sign naming an organization which has a long-rooted history of civil disturbance would cause a significant public concern,"" he wrote. ""Impacts include safety of the traveling public, potential social unrest, driver distraction or interference with the flow of traffic."" The chapter did not immediately respond to messages left Tuesday by CNN. Previously the Klan chapter said it would approach the American Civil Liberties Union if its application was denied. ""All we want to do is adopt a highway,"" Chambers said Monday. ""We're not doing it for publicity. We're doing it to keep the mountains beautiful. People throwing trash out on the side of the road ... that ain't right."" ""We're not racists,"" Chambers said. ""We just want to be with white people. If that's a crime, then I don't know. It's all right to be black and Latino and proud, but you can't be white and proud. I don't understand it."" A kinder, gentler Ku Klux Klan? 'We do not hate anyone,' imperial wizard says . A similar request in Missouri set off a legal battle that stretched for years and went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. A Ku Klux Klan chapter there sought to adopt a portion of Interstate 55. A federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the KKK from participating in the program, and the high court declined to review the case, letting that ruling stand. However, the Missouri Department of Transportation eventually kicked the KKK, a white supremacy group, out of the program because members were not picking up trash as agreed, spokesman Bob Brendel said Monday. The state also named the stretch of I-55 after civil rights activist Rosa Parks, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Georgia has been participating in the Adopt-A-Highway program for more than 20 years. The program provides advertising for sponsors who agree to clean a stretch of road on a sign posted along the stretch. ""Any civic-minded organization, business, individual, family, city, county, state or federal agency is welcome to volunteer in the Georgia Adopt-A-Highway program,"" the DOT website says. Chambers said the group is more than 100 strong. ""We have a lot of support,"" she said. ""I don't see why we can't (adopt the stretch of highway),"" she said. ""Would it be any different if it was the Black Panthers or something? Someone always has some kind of race card."" On its website, the International Keystone Knights of the KKK says it is ""fed up with the Federal tyranny and oppression of Reconstruction, and the time was ripe for Clandestine Armed Resistance."" The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, lists the KKK as ""the most infamous -- and oldest -- of American hate groups."" ""Over the years since it was formed in December 1865, the Klan has typically seen itself as a Christian organization, although in modern times Klan groups are motivated by a variety of theological and political ideologies,"" the law center's website says.","NEW: Letter to Klan cites ""public concern""

"(CNN) -- Apple's A5 chip, which powers the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2, is now being produced in a Texas factory owned by Samsung, Reuters reports, citing sources familiar with the operation. Until now, Apple has mainly relied on Korean and Chinese manufacturers that produced the chips for Apple's products on their soil. Samsung's new $3.6 billion plant in Austin is the size of nine football fields (1.6 million square feet), and it's almost solely dedicated to producing Apple chips. The factory employs some 1,100 workers and it reached full productive capacity this month. This is good news for the city of Austin, where Samsung already has a NAND flash memory factory. According to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, Samsung's factory is the largest foreign investment in Texas, worth about $9 billion. The 45 nm Apple A5 chip runs on either 800 MHz or 1 GHz clock speed, and it's twice as powerful -- according to Apple -- as its predecessor, the A4. Interestingly enough, Samsung is producing chips for Apple, although the two companies still haven't resolved their patent war that has been raging on for months.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- Boko Haram insurgents killed 35 people in coordinated early morning raids on three villages in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno, a military source and residents said, the latest deadly attacks by the militant group. Dozens of Boko Haram gunmen dressed in military uniforms raided Gumushi, Amuda and Arbokko Wednesday in all-terrain vans and on motorcycles, opening fire on residents and torching homes with Molotov cocktails. At least 26 people were killed in Gumushi alone, a military officer in Maiduguri said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the incidents. ""The insurgents hurled petrol bombs into homes, setting them ablaze and shot residents as they tried to escape,"" said the army officer about the 6 a.m. raid. Attacks on the neighboring farm villages of Amuda and Arbokko earlier, around 2 a.m., left nine people dead and several homes destroyed. Arbokko resident Josiah Ali said people were asleep when Boko Haram struck. ""The gunmen fired at people as they rushed out of their homes in a bid to escape,"" Ali said. Thirteen people were seriously injured in the attack in Amuda, resident Pirda Takweshe said. Borno state police commissioner Lawan Tanko confirmed the attacks, but did not give details on casualties. Monday, Boko Haram stormed a military base and a police station in Yobe state, also in the northeast, security sources said. The attacks in the town of Buni Yadi left 18 soldiers and 15 police officers dead, the sources said. The group has stepped up its deadly raids on villages in Borno state in recent months. Boko Haram, which means ""western education is a sin,"" is still holding more than 200 girls it abducted last month from a school in Chibok, also in Borno state. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.","35 killed in latest Boko Haram attacks on villages in northeast Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin should ""man up"" and offer clear explanations amid important questions about the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said on Sunday.

""I would say: 'Putin, you have to man up. You should talk to the world. You should say if this was a mistake, which I hope it was, say it.'

On board the plane were 298 people, with citizens from more than 10 nations. All of them were killed in the crash in eastern Ukraine. ""It's pretty clear that this is a system that was transferred from Russia in the hands of separatists,"" Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN on Sunday. U.S. officials believe the missile systems may have been moved back across the border into Russia. Russia has denied any involvement, and Putin said Ukraine's military campaign against the rebels was to blame. He also has called for a ""thorough and objective investigation"" of the crash. Since the crash, the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels have traded bitter accusations over who was responsible and what has been done since. Ukrainian officials have said that a Russian-made Buk M1 missile system, brought into eastern Ukraine from Russia, had shot down the airliner. But the local head of the rebels, Alexander Borodai, has rejected accusations that his forces shot down the plane, telling reporters that the rebels lacked the firepower to hit an aircraft that high. During the interview, CNN's Candy Crowley pointed out previous sanctions against and meetings with Russia all designed to get that country out of the Ukraine and to stop supplying weapons to the separatists. What makes anyone believe that Putin will ""man up,"" Crowley asked Feinstein? ""I think the world has to rise up and say we've had enough of this,"" the senator said.

"Editor's note: Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci has overseen research into preventing, diagnosing and treating disease and has made numerous discoveries related to HIV/AIDS. He has received the National Medal of Science, the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. April 25, 2009, is World Malaria Day. Dr. Anthony Fauci says we should aim to eradicate the killer disease of malaria. (CNN) -- For the past few decades when talking about malaria, public health officials and malaria experts have avoided the word ""eradication."" This reluctance is based in part on relatively recent history. In 1955, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a valiant effort to eradicate malaria throughout the world. Although the disease was virtually eliminated in many temperate regions and reduced in some tropical areas, the goal of worldwide eradication fell short, and the effort ultimately was abandoned. Today, malaria has resurged with a vengeance. Half the world's population is at risk of malaria infection. Approximately 250 million people get sick with malaria each year and nearly a million individuals die -- mostly young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. So when Bill and Melinda Gates dared to resurrect the ""E"" word in 2007, many in the public health community were skeptical and said in private conversation, ""It can't be done."" We at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initially leaned toward the views of the large chorus of ""eradication skeptics,"" but as the idea began to sink in and we assessed the research landscape, a new sense of optimism emerged. We now believe that malaria eradication -- controlling and eliminating the malaria parasite in every region across the globe -- is possible, but only if we learn from history and our past mistakes. Previous efforts to eradicate malaria failed for several reasons, including political instability and technical challenges in delivering resources, especially in certain countries in Africa. The goal of malaria eradication, although popular among physicians and public health workers, did not muster sustained widespread support among the general public. The diversity of malaria in communities across the globe and the changes in tools and monitoring strategies required over time to achieve eradication were not fully appreciated. And the impact and sustainability of single interventions such as the drug chloroquine and the pesticide DDT were overestimated. Inevitably, malaria parasites developed resistance to commonly used drugs and mosquito vectors became insecticide-resistant. Unfortunately, investments in the research needed to develop new tools was never really adequate. And a sustainable yet flexible infrastructure to deliver the treatment and preventive services that could respond to a changing epidemiology was never developed. It is now widely recognized that any attempt at malaria eradication must be a long-term commitment that involves multiple interventions, disciplines, strategies and organizations. One of the means to develop important new tools critical for the eradication of malaria is through biomedical research. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recognizes that malaria eradication will require a sustained, multidisciplinary research effort by multiple partners across the globe. Indeed, we are a part of a global initiative recently launched by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation called the Malaria Eradication Research and Development Agenda involving research sponsors, public health agencies and interested organizations throughout the world joined by the common collaborative goal of malaria eradication. As we work toward controlling and eliminating malaria in endemic regions of the world, it will be important to monitor shifts in disease patterns as we achieve success. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes may die out in some regions, but reappear in others. Certain drugs may be successful in reducing the burden and controlling the spread of the malaria parasite, but other parasites may soon emerge to reintroduce or resume the disease. Such changes in the patterns of the disease will require new interventions: diagnostics, drugs and ultimately an effective vaccine. Thus, we must maintain a robust pipeline of new interventions that can substitute for failing ones. In developing a research plan for controlling, eliminating and eventually eradicating malaria, we are confronted by substantial challenges. An immediate challenge is diagnosis. Different species of the malaria parasite exist, and it is important to have sensitive and rapid diagnostics that can detect which species are infecting patients and whether they are resistant to standard malaria drug regimens so that the optimal drugs are administered. As our successes mount, we also will need rapid new diagnostics to detect infected individuals with no symptoms who might re-introduce the parasite into areas where the disease has been controlled or eliminated. A second challenge will be to translate the enormous wealth of basic information about malaria parasites, mosquito vectors and the human host into new intervention strategies. For example, we now know the genetic sequences from Anopheles gambiae, the most important mosquito species for spreading malaria, and for the two major malaria parasites of humans: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. It is a daunting task to translate this information into better ways of blocking transmission and preventing and treating infection. Finally, perhaps our greatest challenge is sustaining our research efforts until the ultimate eradication of malaria. We may run the risk of becoming victims of our own success. Once we find ways to reduce the disease burden and deaths due to malaria, the world may no longer perceive malaria as a major threat and may lose interest. Celebrities, politicians and even health officials may focus their attention on other maladies that pose a more immediate threat. We cannot allow this to happen. Unless we want to face the persistence and even resurgence of malaria in the next century and beyond, we must maintain our resolve to fully eradicate this deadly scourge across the globe. It can be done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony S. Fauci.","Dr. Anthony Fauci: Eradicating malaria was dismissed as impossible .

"Bangui, Central African Republic (CNN) -- Two French soldiers sent to the Central African Republic as part of an international peacekeeping mission have been killed, the French presidency said Tuesday. The two soldiers, both paratroopers in their early 20s, were killed in combat in the capital, Bangui, on Monday night, a statement from the Elysee Palace said. ""They lost their lives to save others,"" it said. French President Francois Hollande learned of the soldiers' deaths ""with great sadness,"" the statement said. He also ""reiterates his full confidence in the French forces deployed alongside African forces to restore security in the Central African Republic, protect civilian populations and ensure access to humanitarian aid."" Hollande arrived in the Central African Republic Tuesday evening local time, public service broadcaster Radio France reported, after attending the official memorial service for the late South African President Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg. France, the former colonial power in the Central African Republic, has deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops, after a vote last week in the U.N. Security Council authorizing military intervention. Hollande's visit, during which he was expected to meet with troops, pay his respects before the soldiers' caskets and speak with local leaders, may be intended to help shore up public support back home. Surveys indicate about half the French public back the mission. Hollande did not need parliamentary approval to send troops to the Central African Republic, but the move has wide support from lawmakers. Christian, Muslim militias fight . Violence has raged in the Central African Republic since a coalition of rebels deposed President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. Bozize fled the country after his ouster. Christian vigilante groups have formed to battle Seleka, the predominantly Muslim coalition behind the president's removal. More than 415,000 people -- nearly 10% of the population -- have been internally displaced by the fighting, according to the United Nations, and 68,000 more have fled to neighboring countries. French forces began their operation in the country, east of Cameroon and north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on Friday, a day after the U.N. resolution authorizing their deployment was approved. ""France is determined to act to restore basic security in the Central African Republic, in order to halt the spiral of abuses and sectarian drift, allow the return of humanitarian workers and basic state structures,"" Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. A deadline was set by the African-led peacekeeping force, backed by the French, for the warring militias to disarm by midday Monday. But a CNN team traveling with a U.N. convoy back to Bangui from the town of Bossangoa, about 185 miles north of the capital, said Seleka roadblocks were still in evidence on the main road. The team also saw Christian anti-Balaka militiamen along the road. Smoke could be seen rising a short distance off the road a number of times from what looked like burning villages. As the convoy neared its destination, automatic weapons fire was directed at the main French checkpoint leading into Bangui, where there's a buildup of French forces. Muslim militia: We are true government of CAR . Calling for 'calm and peace' The Pentagon said Monday that American military aircraft would help the peacekeeping efforts by flying African and European peacekeepers to the Central African Republic from Burundi. In a statement, President Barack Obama appealed for the country's citizens to reject violence and urged the transitional government to join ""respected leaders"" in Muslim and Christian communities in calling for ""calm and peace."" ""Individuals who are engaging in violence must be held accountable in accordance with the law. Meanwhile, as forces from other African countries and France work to restore security, the United States will support their efforts to protect civilians,"" Obama said. The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, said the deteriorating security situation over the past few days had ""contributed to the escalation of unlawful killings, sexual violence, recruitment of child soldiers and other grave crimes, across the country."" She urged all parties in the conflict ""to stop attacking civilians and committing crimes, or risk being investigated and prosecuted."" A spike in fighting in Bangui since Thursday has claimed at least 400 lives according to the official count, rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Monday. However, the group estimates as many as 1,000 people may have been killed, with many hastily buried before they could be accounted for. ""The true number of the dead may never be known,"" it said. An estimated 60,000 have been displaced within Bangui, Amnesty International added, as it appealed for urgent steps to protect civilians in vulnerable areas. Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, said its staff had witnessed summary killings inside one hospital in Bangui on Thursday. It called for all sides to respect civilians and medical facilities in Bangui and across the country. Bossangoa camps . As well as carrying out patrols in Bangui, French forces have been sent to Bossangoa, where more than 40,000 of those displaced by fighting have sought refuge in camps. The French intend to make Bossangoa safe and to push out to the even more insecure bush past the city limits, where 100,000 people have been hiding for the past six months in fear for their lives. An official from FOMAC, the multinational force for Central Africa, said the Seleka militia would no longer be allowed to run the country as local administrators, and instead police will begin to do that. Also, members of the militia group will be restricted to their camps, and when they venture out, they will be forced to leave their weapons behind. This rule also applies to the Christian anti-Balaka militia, which includes vigilante groups. If any of the groups defy this order, said the official, they will be forcefully disarmed. But the commander of the Seleka militia, Col. Saleh Zabadi, told the CNN team in Bossangoa that his force has no intention of going anywhere. ""We are this country's government. Leave power? Maybe if we are dead,"" he said defiantly. Fears of genocide: 10 things to know about the Central African Republic .

"Nanjing, China (CNN) -- Off-camera, I'm getting parenting advice from China's first athlete to win gold in any sport at the Winter Olympics. ""Your daughter should go for ice skating,"" Yang Yang advises me. ""It's great for her balance!"" My five-year old is more swimmer than skater but I appreciate Yang's words and especially her intention. She's encouraging me to share the life-changing benefits of sport, not to necessarily groom a future Olympian. Yang herself is a product of a vigorous state system that created elite national athletes. She brought home that long-awaited gold medal in short-track speed skating from the Salt Lake City Olympiad in 2002. To realize her dream, Yang tells me she skated for 23 years, six days a week, for almost 12 hours a day. ""Once you become an athlete, you want to win. That's the most important thing,"" she says. Kids driven away . While Yang says there is nothing wrong with winning, Tom Byer, who works as a coach and educator in a grassroots football program, says that winning has become so overly emphasized that it discourages children from sport. ""Winning of course is a natural response for every athlete,"" Byer says. ""But it can also get in the way. And this is what's happening in grassroots sports all over China, is that the winning has become so important, it drives kids out of the sport."" China may have taken gold in plenty of Olympic events, from speed skating to gymnastics, but it struggles to simply qualify for the World Cup or generate mainstream interest in its bid to host the 2022 Winter Games. Byer blames a fixation on training elite champions in select sports and an education system that considers sports a luxury and not a priority. ""In the West, we look more at physical education as part of education, whereas here, for many years, the educators have tried to keep sport out of education,"" he tells me. Presidential backing . But Olympic chief Thomas Bach assures me that will change. ""I had the opportunity to meet President Xi Jinping twice,"" says the International Olympic Committee President. ""You see clearly the government has realized that sport must be part of education and that sport helps in education."" Byer is doing his part as the Head Technical Adviser to the Chinese School Football program, a project that works with two million children in more than 6,200 schools across China. His success at teaching football skills to students in Japan earned him stardom there, and an invitation to bring his technical magic to China. But while charismatic coaches fan out across China's schools -- and Xi proclaims his love for football -- it could take years to change the nation's attitude toward sport... and for China to build an industry around it. Shanghai-based Sheng Li is one of China's top sports agents. He laments how professional sports in China lack the infrastructure to make more money for his clients, like professional boxer and Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming. ""If you come through the national system, you have the coach and the training system,"" Li says. ""But there's a whole system behind a (professional) athlete: the PR, the brand, the corporate sponsorship, helping them find the best coaches outside the system. ""That's a whole new system we're starting to build."" Olympic bid . Yang is supporting China's athletes after their Olympic dream with the Athlete Career Program she started as part of her foundation. She's also getting more children interested in sport with a new skating school in Shanghai that is open to everyone. On top of that, she's leading the charge for China's bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. China, along with Kazakhstan and Norway, is a finalist to host the event. Winning the bid and hosting the games would transform the sport scene in China, sparking greater interest in winter sports like snowboarding, skiing and skating. More than a decade ago, Yang was in it to win it. Today, she's using her Olympic legacy to bring a love of her sport to the masses.","China has created a vigorous state system that has produced elite national athletes .
But some argue the emphasis on winning has discouraged many children .
At the other end of the scale, sport is not considered a part of your education in China .
China has also struggled in sports like football, interest in holding a Winter Olympics is low ."
"(CNN) -- Over the past decade, Luo Changping has built a reputation as one of China's most respected journalists. The 33 year old has exposed alleged financial wrongdoing by more than 100 senior government officials during that time. ""We know the smog is terrible in Beijing now but worse than the real smog is the political smog,"" he says. ""Chinese tax-payers have no idea where their money goes."" Luo's most high-profile scoop came last December when, in a series of articles, he accused a powerful official at China's top economic planning body of illegal financial dealings. The stories ultimately resulted in the official's dismissal from office. Luo published the allegations on his own microblog, under his real name. It was a risky move in a country where both independent bloggers and state-run media are subject to intense censorship. Beijing's corruption crackdown . On Friday, he received international recognition for his work from anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, which has honored Luo with an Integrity Award. ""Luo's success was a rare victory in the struggle for transparency in China,"" the organization said. ""His actions have demonstrated the important role for investigative journalism and social media in the fight against corruption."" Modest man . A deputy managing editor for the financial magazine Caijing, Luo is modest and says he got lucky with his investigation of a key official in China's top economic planning body. ""I wouldn't even be able to duplicate it again today, because there were so many coincidences,"" he told CNN. He says he spent a year painstakingly collecting evidence. ""At the beginning it was very difficult,"" Luo said. ""Not a lot of media wanted to touch the story. Also, a lot of officials have their own connections within the government, and they sometimes can be very powerful."" So Luo acted alone. He named the official accused of corruption as Liu Tienan, who was then a director of the National Energy Agency and deputy head of China's National Development and Reform Commission, a body that sets China's economic agenda. At first, he wasn't afraid. ""Many (journalists in China) are worried about their safety, that's understandable. But for me, I didn't think the danger was fatal. Reporters in China won't be killed, but they sometimes do suffer from bigger threats."" But Luo said he became worried when his reporting attracted the attention of the official Liu, who, Luo says, started a search into his family background. ""I'm not afraid of myself being in danger, but I am concerned about my family."" Opinion: In China, 'everyone is guilty of corruption' When Luo's investigation became public, Liu denied the charges and threatened to sue for libel. The story spread across social media but there was no reaction from the government for months. However, in May, Liu was officially dismissed over what authorities said was his suspected involvement in ""serious disciplinary violations."" Liu was also expelled from the Communist Party. An investigation is still ongoing. CNN has been unable to reach Liu for comment. Luo had an early role model in his father, whose honest character was well-known in his local community and in local politics in the province of Hunan, Luo told Transparency International. ""Tell the truth,"" his father instructed. ""Don't do evil,"" was his mother's advice. He organized a school newspaper and was in charge of the school radio station. Corruption is still the main focus of Luo's reporting, and he hopes others will be inspired to take up the cause. ""We are in shortage of people who are willing and passionate about investigative pieces. I hope we can have more people get into this field,"" he said .

"(CNN) -- The PGA Tour has issued a denial over reports that American golfer Dustin Johnson is serving a suspension for failing a drugs test. World No.16 Johnson said Thursday that he would be taking a break from the sport to seek ""professional help"" to improve his mental health. It ruled him out of next week's PGA Championship at Valhalla and the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in Scotland, where he was expected to be a key member of the United States team. In the aftermath of his announcement, a published report on Golf.com made a series of allegations about his use of recreational drugs and claimed he had actually been banned from the Tour after testing positive for cocaine. In response, the PGA Tour issued a statement on its website. ""With regard to media reports that Dustin Johnson has been been suspended by the PGA Tour, this is to clarify that Mr. Johnson has taken a voluntary leave of absence and is not under a suspension from the PGA Tour,"" the statement read. Johnson, who finished 12th at the British Open last month, paired on the final day with eventual winner Rory McIlroy, did not specify the exact length of his absence from golf in the statement released by his management company. ""I am taking a leave of absence from professional golf, effective immediately. I will use this time to seek professional help for personal challenges I have faced,"" it read. ""By committing the time and resources necessary to improve my mental health, physical well-being and emotional foundation, I am confident that I will be better equipped to fulfill my potential and become a consistent champion."" THE PGA of America, which runs the PGA Championship and the U.S. Ryder Cup team, later confirmed his withdrawal from those to events. Reacting to the announcement Friday, U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson told the PGA website: ""We will certainly miss Dustin Johnson at Gleneagles, and we wish him the best. ""As one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3-0 at Medinah in 2012, he has clearly been an asset for the United States team. That said, the United States is a team with an abundance of talent."" Tiger Woods added to his captain's words. ""I'll tell you what, with his power, you always want guys with that kind of power to play on any team. I've been his partner in the Presidents Cup in Australia, and the fire power that he has, it's pretty cool to be around,"" said the 14-time major winner. ""It's not too often you see a guy carry the ball 320 (yards) without even trying, and then when he steps on it he can hit it even further. When he gets it going, it's awfully impressive."" Johnson, who is currently ranked fifth in the standings of U.S. golfers would have almost certainly been an automatic pick for the Ryder Cup. The 30-year-old has won eight titles on the PGA Tour and is highly regarded by fans and fellow professionals for his big hitting game. Former U.S. Open champion and European Ryder Cup opponent Justin Rose also passed on his regards to his friend and colleague. ""I just wish him well, whatever he's facing right now,"" Rose said in quotes carried by UK news agency, the Press Association. ""(It) can't be easy for him. I wish him all the best. He's a friend of mine (but I) didn't really know that that was on the cards."" Johnson rounded off his statement by requesting privacy in the months ahead as he begins his time off. ""I respectfully ask my fans, well-wishers and the media for privacy as I embark upon this mission of self-improvement,"" he said. Johnson had earlier pulled out of this week's WGC-Bridgestone International at Firestone GC, Ohio, citing ""personal reasons."" That tournament was being led by Sergio Garcia after a third round 67, which was interrupted by thunderstorms. On 14-under, the Spaniard was three clear of McIlroy, who is playing his first event since his British Open triumph. Defending champion Tiger Woods again struggled with a two-over-par 72 for one-over with a round to go.","PGA Tour issues denial over Dustin Johnson ban reports .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dionne Warwick, one of the most recognizable pop voices of the 1960s, filed for bankruptcy last week, citing more than $10 million in tax debt dating back to 1991. ""Due to several consecutive years (the late '80s through the mid-'90s) of negligent and gross financial mismanagement, Dionne Warwick has realized the current necessity to file personal bankruptcy,"" Warwick publicist Kevin Sasaki said in a statement to CNN Tuesday. Warwick, 72, made hits out of many Burt Bacharach and Hal David songs, and won five Grammys in a 50-year career. The singer is down her last $1,000 in cash and only owns furniture and clothing worth $1,500, according to the Chapter 7 filing in New Jersey. The bankruptcy documents filed in New Jersey on Thursday outline a sad financial situation for Warwick, a cousin of the late Whitney Houston. Along with $7 million in federal IRS debt, Warwick said she owes more than $3 million to the state of California in franchise taxes. Another $500,000 is owed to a lawyer and a business manager, the filing said. ""In light of the magnitude of her tax liabilities, Warwick has repeatedly attempted to offer repayment plans and proposals to the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board for taxes owed,"" Sasaki said. ""These plans were not accepted, resulting in escalating interest and penalties. Although the actual amount of back taxes owed have been paid, the resulting penalties and interest has continually accrued."" Warwick's total assets are worth just $25,500, mostly because of two fur coats and two sets of diamond earrings valued at $13,000, the documents showed. She also claimed clothing worth $5,000, art worth $5,000 and furniture valued at $15,500. Warwick recently took a credit card debt management class, it said, perhaps relating to a $20,000 Visa debt. Her monthly income was listed at $20,950, although she is eligible for a pension from the SAG/AFTRA union, the filing said. Warwick listed her employment with Star Girl Productions, an entertainment management company. She has been touring in recent months, singing her hits for fans in Europe and South America, according to her website. Warwick's success began in 1962 with ""Don't Make Me Over,"" followed by 18 consecutive Top 100 singles. Other Bacharach/David classics include ""Walk on By,"" ""Anyone Who Had a Heart,"" ""Message to Michael,"" ""Promises Promises,"" ""A House is Not a Home,"" ""Alfie,"" ""Say a Little Prayer,"" ""This Girl's in Love With You,"" ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again,"" ""Reach Out For Me"" and the theme from ""Valley of the Dolls."" ""Warwick has spent many years of her career raising funds for several humanitarian and philanthropic causes without compensation,"" Sasaki said. ""Aside from carrying the banner for world hunger, she was the first musical artist to donate all sales and proceeds from her landmark recording, 'That's What Friends Are For' to AIDS and The American Foundation For AIDS Research (amfAR)."" 2012: Dionne Warwick sings Hal David's last lyrics .

"(CNN) -- iPhone screens are about to get a lot bigger, if a new report is to be believed. Suppliers in China are about to start work on two new iPhones, according to an article from Bloomberg. The phones will have display screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches across, when measured diagonally -- a major leap from the 4-inch displays on the iPhone 5S and 5C. Such a move would appear to be an effort to keep up with the competition. Rival smartphones, most notably those from Samsung, have been packing ever-larger displays in recent years. If these rumors are true, the bigger iPhone would nearly match the screen size of Samsung's massive Galaxy Note 3, with its pocket-busting, 5.7-inch ""phablet"" display. The Korean company's flagship Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch display, the new HTC One M8 has a 5-inch screen and the recently announced Amazon Fire phone checks in at 4.7 inches. The Bloomberg report says the new iPhones will ship to retailers ""around September"" and be more rounded and thinner than previous models. That would be consistent with launch patterns from Apple, which for the past several years has announced new iPhones in early fall. If the report is true, this would mark the second consecutive year Apple has released two phones. Last year, Apple borrowed from the playbook of Samsung and other competitors by releasing the high-end iPhone 5S and the cheaper, more colorful 5C model. Almost a year later, the plastic iPhone 5C sells for as low as $99 with a wireless contract. For the previous six years, Apple had offered only a single, iconic phone even as competitors rolled out phones with many sizes, shapes and prices. The new iPhones may also be part of a one-two punch from Apple, which has been under pressure to innovate and which has promised new products in 2014. Reports have said a long-awaited Apple smartwatch is also coming this fall. A Reuters report says the watch will have a 2.5-inch screen and be ""slightly rectangular.""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Reports of more demonstrations filtered out of Iran on Wednesday, including some that mentioned attacks on people mourning the death of a prominent cleric who was critical of the government. The reports come two days after a witness said that tens of thousands of people chanted anti-government slogans before the funeral of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution who went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics. On Wednesday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on pro-government demonstrations in the neighboring cities of Isfahan and Najafabad, roughly 200 miles south of Tehran. That account did not mention clashes, but another did. A news site maintained by reformists in the Iranian parliament said that people in plain clothes used tear gas and pepper spray to attack people who had gathered in a mosque in Isfahan to mourn Montazeri's death; it said 50 people were arrested. Like other accounts, the report on the reformists' news site could not independently be verified. Montazeri died Sunday at age 87. A key figure in Iran's Islamic Revolution 30 years ago, Montazeri became the most prominent cleric to publicly criticize the presidential elections last June that returned hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidency. Writing on his Web site after the disputed June presidential elections, Montazeri described the street protests that followed the polling as a challenge to the ""very legitimacy of the Islamic Republic."" His death is ""a terrible blow for the (reformist) green movement and everybody who has been active these past few months,"" said Mehrdad Khonsari, a senior research consultant at the Centre for Arab and Iranian Studies in London. ""He was a very senior grand ayatollah with very good revolutionary credentials, and a very vocal critic of the ruling establishment,"" Khonsari said. ""He was a major thorn in the back of (Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei. He was a bastion for all the people opposing the excesses of the system,"" even within the ruling establishment, he said. In the past six months, Montazeri had become the voice of the reformist movement on key foreign policy issues, Khonsari said. The cleric was able to comment more freely than reformist presidential candidates, he said. Montazeri, for example, took a public stand against nuclear weapons in October, issuing a fatwa, or religious edict, declaring them to be ""un-Islamic"" and instructing Muslims to take the lead in banning them, said Nazenin Ansari, diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper Kayhan in London. Iran's nuclear program has been the subject of intense international concern, with the United Nations considering expanding sanctions against the Islamic state despite its insistence it does not intend to build a bomb. Montazeri had a very large public following, especially since the June elections and all his statements in favor of human rights,"" Ansari said . He was once a confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran for a decade after the revolution. He studied under Khomeini and then acted as his representative in Iran after Khomeini was exiled by the shah for criticizing the monarchy, Ansari said. Montazeri, too, was jailed and exiled. After the revolution, he was the heir apparent to Khomeini, and played a key role in writing Iran's constitution as the first chair of the powerful Guardians Council. He was also the leader of Friday prayers in Tehran, one of the most public and influential pulpits in the country. But he was supplanted by the current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and was placed under several years of house arrest in 1997. ""His problems with Khomeini started in the summer of 1988 when they started executing ... thousands of leftist prisoners,"" Ansari said. ""He never was in agreement with that, and then he started to fade"" from power. ""Once Khamenei became leader, Montazeri objected,"" she said. Montazeri said Khamenei ""was elevated above his (religious) qualifications,"" pointing out that he had not earned the title of ayatollah. ""It was then he was arrested."" Recently, Montazeri has objected to the current regime's characterization of his one-time mentor Khomeini as a saint, she added. And following the disputed elections in June, ""he issued a ground-breaking fatwa articulating the policies of the green movement to the world. Montazeri had been equally critical of the parliamentary electoral process in 2004, arguing in favor of reformist candidates.","Reformist news site claims tear gas, pepper spray used against mourners .

"(CNN) -- Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl will meet next week with the general who's looking into how the now-freed prisoner of war was captured by the Taliban in 2009, the Army and his attorney said. Attorney Eugene Fidell told CNN he will know for sure next week exactly when the meeting will take place. Bergdahl has met once before, briefly, with Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, the point person for the Army's investigation. The 28-year-old soldier spent five years in the hands of Taliban militants after he disappeared in Afghanistan in June 2009. After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas. The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but it quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official recently told CNN. Bergdahl is now back on regular duty at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas. He is working with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his rank of sergeant, the Army said earlier this month. Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured, and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity. A grateful Bergdahl 'understands that his life has been saved,' lawyer says .","Bergdahl and Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl have met once before, briefly .

"(CNN) -- Broadcaster Lee Thomas' patchwork skin has being losing pigment for 17 years. He's gotten used to the constant stares when his work makeup is off; he doesn't even mind being asked about his varying skin tones. Thomas laughs when he recalls one of his 6-year-old daughter's friends telling him he looked like a cow. After Thomas explained he had vitiligo, the boy asked if they could play Frisbee. ""It's not really the ignorance,"" Thomas said about the lack of awareness surrounding vitiligo. ""It's the malicious ignorance. Adults are weird."" He remembers playing a ""visual tennis match"" with a man in his office. The man would stare at Thomas, then as soon as Thomas looked at him, the man looked away. They volleyed back and forth until Thomas told him, ""It's OK if you want to look."" He went through what he calls an ""angry spotted-guy"" period when he would give menacing looks to those who stared at him. ""Eventually I said, 'That's not me' and would do the opposite,"" he said. ""I'd give them the million-dollar smile that got me into my work in the first place and turn it into a conversation rather than a spectacle."" What's vitiligo? June 25 marks World Vitiligo Day, which is aimed at raising awareness about the incurable disease. Vitiligo affects roughly 100 million people worldwide, according to the Vitiligo Research Foundation. It's not contagious or fatal, but scientists don't know exactly what causes it. ""The body acts as if it's allergic to its pigment cells,"" said Dr. Mark Lebwohl, a professor and dermatologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The pigment cells, also known as melanocytes, die or stop producing melanin, leaving patches of colorless skin all over a person's body. Vitiligo doesn't discriminate, affecting people of all skin colors, but it is most noticeable in people with darker skin. Michael Jackson probably had the most well-known case of vitiligo; rumor has it Jackson wore a single glove to hide some of the splotches on his hand. Thomas said he also, for a time, wore a single glove while reporting stories to cover his symptoms. Though there is no cure for vitiligo, there are many treatment options that vary in effectiveness and cost. Topical creams and ointments can repigment the skin, but Lebwohl said this process can take years. Laser treatments, which target affected skin areas with light therapy, can produce results in just a few treatments. These treatments work best in dark-skinned people and on the face. There are also some surgical treatments, ""but sometimes the healing is not uniform so it can look like there's scarring,"" Lebwohl said. Vitiligo patients often struggle for years to find something that works for them. Lebwohl says one of his colleagues at Mount Sinai has done great work in mapping the causes of vitiligo in the immune system. Lebwohl believes better treatments will be available in the next decade or so that target the roots of the disease. Getting past the stigma . Thomas wore makeup on his face anytime he was out of the house for nearly four years until he was no longer able to hide his vitiligo, he said. Being a TV personality, he worried that he would lose his job if his bosses and co-workers found out about his condition. Eventually he had to reveal it, and to his relief, it wasn't an issue. ""My bosses here at the time were always very supportive,"" he said. ""The conflict was within."" He now goes without makeup when he's not working, but he still wears makeup on camera because his vitiligo is so visible he feels it distracts from the stories he reports. Vitiligo isn't physically painful, but Lebwohl emphasized it's not strictly a cosmetic condition either. ""It's debilitating. Imagine every time you meet someone you have a disorder clearly on your face,"" he said. ""It's really a psychological disorder."" Yan Valle, who works with the Vitiligo Foundation, said he's watched his pigment disappear since he was 6. It started on his legs, then spread to his hands, face and neck. ""It's not as bad as on dark-skinned people, but still, kids see everything,"" Valle said. Like Thomas, he senses that his vitiligo makes people uncomfortable -- on subways or elevators, strangers purposely avoid looking at the spots. Valle says he grew up with few resources to help him understand the condition or how to treat it. He helped found the Vitiligo Research Foundation in 2010 and now works full-time to provide resources to medical professionals and those with the condition. Thomas has written a book, ""Turning White,"" and often speaks about his experience with vitiligo. He met one woman and her brother at a support group he started in Detroit, which he says was the first vitiligo support group in the United States. The woman's brother told Thomas she hadn't left the house in months because of her insecurities with the disease. ""She said 'I don't know how you do it,' "" Thomas said. ""There are lots suffering in silence, and I hope to be their voice."" CNN anchor battles her skin and wins .","Vitiligo affects roughly 100 million people worldwide .

"(CNN) -- Sunday night's American Music Awards seemed much tamer than many of the other awards shows lately, despite having the promise of host rapper Pitbull to ABC that ""I hope you got that delay button ready; we're going to have a lot of fun."" But there were a few moments during the evening that had viewers buzzing. Here are a few: . 1) Justin Timberlake epitomizes ""crossover"" We will try not to drop the term ""blue-eyed soul"" here, but the former 'N Sync member nabbed not only favorite pop/rock male but also favorite soul/R& B male and soul/R& B album awards. Before presenting him with the latter award, comedian Sarah Silverman joked that the competition was between Timberlake, the son of the ""dad from Growing Pains"" (aka) Robin Thicke and Rihanna. ""Growing up in Memphis, Tennessee, I can say this is the first time I have ever been racially profiled by a white woman,"" Timberlake joked during his acceptance speech. 2) J.Lo pays tribute to Celia Cruz . Jennifer Lopez seemed to embody the spirit of Cuban salsa queen Cruz, who died in 2003. For those who had forgotten that Lopez first got into the business as a dancer, she reminded fans as she also sang a medley of Spanish tunes made famous by Cruz. Add to that the multiple ruffled and fringed costume changes during the number, which also featured a stage full of fellow dancers, and it was a rollicking good time. 3) Lady Gaga and R. Kelly get ""Trapped in the Closet"" If you aren't familiar with the rap opera that is R. Kelly's ""Trapped in the Closet,"" we can't even begin to describe it to you, so get thee to Google. The AMA performance with Gaga on their collaboration ""Do What U Want"" was definitely reminiscent of that dramatic saga. It appeared to be a play on the reported John F. Kennedy/Marilyn Monroe romance as Gaga played secretary to his ""President Kelly"" and stripped down to a spangled bodysuit. The pair sang their dialogue before actually launching into the song that they also so memorably performed on ""Saturday Night Live."" It was ... interesting. 4) Macklemore & Ryan Lewis get political . Accepting the award for favorite rap/hip hop album, Macklemore used the opportunity to speak out against racial profiling. ""Due to the fact that we are in Florida tonight accepting this award, I want to acknowledge Trayvon Martin and the hundreds and hundreds of kids who are dying each year due to racial profiling and the violence that follows,"" the rapper said via satellite. ""These are our friends, our neighbors, our peers, our fans, and it's time that we look out for the youth and fight against racism and the laws that protect it."" The pair later rocked the crowd with a rousing performance of ""Can't Hold Us"" with Ray Dalton. 5) Rihanna's mom presents her with an award . Monica Fenty couldn't have been prouder taking to the stage to give her daughter Rihanna the first-ever Icon Award. ""Rihanna, I'm so proud of you tonight,"" Fenty said. ""I know the journey in your career has not always been an easy one, but tonight I applaud and admire you."" The singer, who performed her hit ""Diamonds,"" seemed awed that she was receiving such an accolade so early in her career. ""My fans, I love you so much; you have no idea,"" Rihanna said. ""I can't believe at 25, I am holding an Icon Award!"" 6) Miley Cyrus and her crying cat . What to even say about this one? By now, Cyrus is known for her outrageous outfits and controversial performances, so the scant cat-print two-piece outfit she rocked during her rendition of ""Wrecking Ball"" wasn't shocking. But the ginger kitten floating through space on the big screen behind her mouthed the words to the song and began crying what appeared to be diamonds was a bit disconcerting. Oh Miley, what does it all mean? Honorable mentions should also go to TLC and the show's audience. TLC brought ""special guest"" rapper Lil Mama along to perform their classic hit ""Waterfalls."" She recently portrayed the late Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes in a VH1 biopic about the girl group and her appearance Sunday night left social media speculating whether she would be joining the group to replace Lopes, who was killed in a 2002 car crash. The audience gets a special moments shout-out because they gave everyone a standing ovation. Literally everyone. At some points, the awards show began to feel like a presidential State of the Union address with so many standing Os. There were some actual statues handed out during the show. Taylor Swift set an AMA record with her third win for artist of the year. She also nabbed country artist female and favorite country album for her best-selling ""Red."" Ariana Grande was named new artist of the year, and Florida Georgia Line won single of the year for their song ""Cruise"" featuring rapper Nelly. The American Music Awards was broadcast live on ABC from the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles.","Justin Timberlake shows that he has the crossover chops .

"(CNN) -- Urban exploration is an edgy pastime. But give it a Japanese name and this underground community, known for seeking out derelict and often inaccessible environments, sounds even more hardcore. Haikyo is the Japanese word for ruins and is the term used to describe urban exploration (""urbex""), a growing trend for people to track down and often photograph society's crumbling edifices. Urbex in Japan plays out in much the same way it does in the rest of the world -- explorers are recreational trespassers who seek out abandoned, man-made structures, where they have a good poke around as they soak up the atmosphere. There are few hard and fast rules aside from the oft-quoted mantra -- ""Take nothing but photographs, leave only footprints"" -- but there are a few aspects that are unique to urban exploration in Japan. Among these, abandoned amusement parks and sex museums. German Florian Seidel, a translator, has lived in Japan more than seven years and been a dedicated urbexer for almost five. He says he's seen the hobby take off in Japan since he started. Although there are no official numbers -- urbexers tend to be a low key, scattered community not least of all because of the potentially illegal aspects of the business, such as trespassing -- he says the number of urbex blogs has exploded from a dozen when he started to about 100 today, most of which are in Japanese. ""There are tons of abandoned places in Japan, the problem is you have to find them,"" says Seidel. That's the part he most enjoys. He's proud of the fact that more than 90% of the places on his site, Abandonedkansai.com, he has researched and found himself. As with most urbexers, he doesn't give away exact locations, largely because he doesn't want to see them overrun. 'Very, very weird' The detective work doesn't end when he's found and explored a site. Seidel likes to find out about the history of place. Take those abandoned sex museums -- there are two in Japan, both of which have been deserted for more than 10 years. ""In the 1960s, Europe had the sexual revolution, but that didn't happen in Japan -- they had sex museums, especially in onsen [hot spring] towns,"" says Seidel. ""There were 20 to 30 sex museums all over Japan, pretty much one in every prefecture. Most of them closed from the beginning of the 1990s -- I guess the Internet killed them."" Seidel has visited two abandoned Japanese sex museums and although both have clearly been picked over and pilfered from, enough remains to make it clear what they were all about. The one in Hokkaido he remembers best for the bizarre shooting games and taxidermy animals in sexual positions -- horses and monkeys. ""You could say it was partly educational and very, very weird,"" says Seidel. The other museum, in southern Japan, is filled with crumbling erotic statues and sculptures and an eerie naked mannequin in a white casket, her mutated nipples pointing in all directions. He found old advertising pamphlets that boasted of wax dolls of Marilyn Monroe and a 1970s erotic star, but these were long gone when he visited. Other amusements . The current hot haikyo site is an abandoned amusement park, Nara Dreamland, says Seidel. It's so popular that a security guard has been posted at the gate to try and keep out the curious. ""Technically, if there's a security guard there it's not abandoned, but it makes it onto all the lists and blogs,"" says Seidel. Nara Dreamland, built in 1961 and closed in 2006, does make for dramatic images -- the abandoned, rusting rollercoaster set amid the desolate ruins of the theme park. If you're after atmosphere, it's got plenty. But what about the danger factor? ""I'm a conservative explorer, I've never been injured, but it's definitely dangerous,"" says Seidel. ""There are all sorts of rusty things where you could get tetanus, there's barbed wire and some military areas could still have ammunition -- a mine could go off."" For a sample of Seidel's haikyo images, you can check out the above gallery or visit his site, Abandonedkansai.com.","Around the world, urban explorers hunt down and often photograph society's crumbling edifices .

"(CNN) -- A Jordanian court Thursday acquitted radical cleric Abu Qatada of charges of conspiracy to bomb an American school in the late 1990s, state media reported. Qatada, whose real name is Omar Othman, was also charged with a 2000 attempt to bomb millennium celebrations in Jordan. He will remain in jail pending a verdict on that case, according to Petra news agency. It did not say why he was found not guilty in the American school case. The cleric was deported from the United Kingdom last year, ending a years-long legal battle to force him to leave the country. A Jordanian national, he was wanted in his home country, where he had been convicted in absentia on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions. Britain had been trying to deport him since 2001, but his legal appeals kept him there until last year. In January 2012, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan over fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at trial. British authorities said he raised funds for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and publicly supported militants' violent activities. Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. Abu Qatada has denied the allegations against him. He arrived in the UK in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children.

"Washington (CNN) -- America's longest war. Much more National Security Agency surveillance. An alphabet soup of new government departments and agencies. Long security lines at airports. All those things happened in response to the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks on New York and the Pentagon that forever changed U.S. security perceptions and practices. Now a commission created to examine what happened then says we need to do more now to protect ourselves. Read the 9/11 Commission's new report . ""The 'generational struggle' against terrorism described in 'The 9/11 Commission Report' is far from over,"" the panel said this week in reference to its assessment a decade earlier. ""Rather, it is entering a new and dangerous phase, and America cannot afford to let down its guard."" Its bottom line assessment? ""Strenuous counterterrorism efforts will remain a fact of our national life for the foreseeable future."" Here is a look at the report, analyzing what has worked, what hasn't and has to happen now. WHAT WORKED . Going after al Qaeda's leadership . The immediate reaction to the hijack attacks that toppled the World Trade Center towers and damaged the Pentagon targeted the culprit -- the al Qaeda network of Osama bin Laden operating out of Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. Years of war in Afghanistan ended the safe haven there for terrorists and achieved the goal of degrading al Qaeda's core, the report said. U.S. special forces eventually killed bin Laden in Pakistan. Air travel security . Long security lines, reinforced cockpit doors, removing laptops from carry-on bags, no liquids, checking shoes -- all followed the attacks that killed 3,000 people. A no-fly list that had 16 names before the attacks now has more than 1,000, the report noted. So far, no similar foreign attack has occurred in America. The closest call came in 2009 when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab failed to ignite an explosive in his underwear as a Northwest Airlines jet from Amsterdam approached Detroit on Christmas Day. Expanded government . The Department of Homeland Security. The director of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center. The Transportation Security Administration. The FBI National Security Branch and the military's Cyber Command. All exist in response to the 9/11 attacks as part of an unprecedented expansion and reorganization of government security resources. ""These measures have largely succeeded,"" the report said. ""The mass-casualty attacks many feared in the wake of 9/11 did not materialize. Today, in large part because of these many reforms, the United States is a much harder target."" NSA surveillance . The security apparatus also expanded its ability to track telephone and computer communications after 9/11. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified details of those programs last year, revealing they were much broader and potentially intrusive than publicly known. A resulting backlash at home and abroad caused the Obama administration to make some changes without substantively changing the ability to monitor suspect communications. ""We believe these programs are worth preserving, albeit with additional oversight,"" the report said. The American spirit . The Boston Marathon went on as scheduled this spring, undeterred by the terrorist bombings at the finish line a year earlier, the 9/11 commissioners noted. ""This year's triumphant marathon sent an unmistakable message to the world: Americans will not bend to terrorism,"" the report said, adding that ""the country must continue to prepare for the unforeseen, but it appears to be moving in the right direction."" WHAT HASN'T WORKED . Full disclosure . The new report's biggest takeaway? Tell the people what they need to know. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, ""the government did not effectively explain to the public the evil that was stalking us,"" it said. ""We fear that this is happening again."" On major issues of the day -- a transformed and resurging al Qaeda, the growing terrorist haven spawned by the Syrian conflict, increasing cyber threats -- ""public awareness lags behind official Washington's,"" it said. ""If this gap persists, the political support for needed national security capabilities will fade,"" the report continued. ""In today's very dangerous world, that is something we can ill afford."" Efforts to reduce Islamic extremism . Islamic extremism has increased in the past decade, the report said. ""While al Qaeda's various affiliates are enmeshed in their own local conflicts, hatred of the United States remains a common thread,"" it added, citing the emergence of groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Al Shabaab and Boko Haram. ""Partly, this is a consequence of the Arab Spring and the power vacuums and ungoverned spaces that have sprung up in its wake,"" it said. ""Partly, it is the result of America's inability or reluctance to exert power and influence in a number of places."" In particular, the commissioners noted their 2004 report on the 9/11 attacks said that if Iraq became a failed state, ""it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against Americans at home."" Today, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria controls vast territory in those countries, creating ""a massive terrorist sanctuary,"" the latest report said. A State Department official warned a congressional committee on Wednesday that ""ISIS is al Qaeda."" ""It may have changed its name, it may have broken with senior al Qaeda leadership such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, but it is al Qaeda in its doctrine, ambition and increasingly in its threat to U.S. interests,"" said Brett McGurk, the deputy assistant secretary for Iraq and Iran. ""In fact it is worse than al Qaeda."" Congress . Not surprisingly, a dysfunctional Congress with some of the lowest approval ratings also gets cited by the 9/11 commissioners. The funding process for national security is fragmented, with multiple budget categories providing the money. In addition, the Homeland Security Department reports to more than 90 congressional committees and subcommittees. ""While the executive branch has undergone historic change and institutional reform, Congress has proved deeply resistant to needed change,"" the report said. ""It has made some minor adjustments, but not the necessary structural changes in oversight and appropriations for homeland security and intelligence."" WHAT NOW . Prepare better for cyber attacks . According to the report, readiness to deal with cyber attacks ""lags far behind the threat."" The commissioners noted the issue got little mention in their 2004 report, but now represents a constant and growing concern. ""One lesson of the 9/11 story is that, as a nation, Americans did not awaken to the gravity of the terrorist threat until it was too late,"" the report said. ""History may be repeating itself in the cyber realm."" It called for government leaders to ""describe to the American people, in terms as specific as possible, the nature of the threat and the tools they need to combat it."" ""A growing chorus of senior national security officials describes the cyber domain as the battlefield of the future,"" the report said. ""Yet Congress has been unable to pass basic cybersecurity legislation, despite repeated attempts."" Use of military powers . After 2001, Congress authorized the use of military forces against terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks. It remains the legislative permission slip today. The report said the authorization needs updating, calling on the administration to ""clearly explain whether it needs new legal authority to confront threats like ISIS and how far, in its view, any new authority should extend."" Better oversight . Streamline the system so that the NSA and the Homeland Security Department have more clear and direct oversight, the report recommended. ""If Congress is not effectively overseeing these programs, no one is,"" the report said. Vigilance . The biggest threat to America is failing to recognize the threat still exists and is growing. ""Many Americans think that the terrorist threat is waningâ€”that, as a country, we can begin turning back to other concerns,"" the report said. ""They are wrong."" The threat remains ""grave,"" it continued, warning ""we cannot afford to be complacentâ€”vigorous counterterrorism efforts are as important as ever."" In particular, the report said, ""young Americans need to know that terrorism is not going away."" CNN's Mike M. Ahlers and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","Americans don't realize the terrorist threat they face, a new report says .
Get used to ""strenuous counterterrorism efforts,"" the 9/11 commission says .
It issued a new assessment 10 years after its report on the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Cyber attacks have become a major threat, the new report says ."
"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez may have bitten off more than he can chew this time. Already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent, the Uruguay striker was seemingly at it again in his country's key World Cup victory over Italy. Just before Uruguay's winning goal, the striker was embroiled in an off the ball incident with Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini with both men falling to the floor. And he could be facing a lengthy ban -- despite his attempts to play down the incident. ""The only thing I know is that those are occurrences that happen on the pitch,"" Suarez told reporters. ""I just collided with his shoulder. They are just casual incidences that occur during a soccer game. "" Television pictures showed Suarez dipping his head towards Chiellini, and when the Italian defender eventually got up, he pulled down his shirt and appeared to furiously indicate that he had been bitten on the shoulder. ""Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup,"" Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia. ""I'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him. The referee saw the bite mark too, but he did nothing about it.,"" added the Juventus defender. FIFA has opened proceedings against the forward, for breach of FIFA disciplinary code. FIFA added that Suarez and/or his national association are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant, with a 5pm (Brasilia time) deadline. The 27-year-old Suarez will now face a nervous wait to find out if football's world governing body FIFA will take action retrospectively -- given it was missed by the match officials - and punish him. But FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, who also presides as head of the organizations referees committee, says he has huge concerns over Suarez's actions. ""I have watched the incident several times on television,"" he told reporters. ""There is no doubt Luis Suarez is a fantastic footballer but, once again, his actions have left him open to severe criticism. ""FIFA must investigate the incident seriously and take whatever disciplinary action deemed necessary."" According to FIFA's disciplinary code, the forward could face a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years. Former Italian international Mauro Tassotti was given an eight-match ban in 1994, the longest suspension in World Cup history, after breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique. Zinedine Zidane, the former France midfielder, was handed a three-match ban for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the 2006 final. While FIFA has yet to make a decision, Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez insists he did not see the incident when he addressed the press in his news conference. ""I'd like to see the images,"" he said. ""I didn't see that. And if it happened the referee probably didn't see it. So no I don't have any more comments to make. We had more important things than this in a football match. ""There seems there is animosity against this football player,"" he added. ""He just came out of a difficult moment and he has been penalized. There are people hiding behind the tree waiting for something to happen."" Suarez was also backed by team captain Diego Lugano, who instead blamed Chiellini for exaggerating the entire episode. When asked by reporters about the incident he said: ""You saw this, really? ""You need to show me because I didn't see anything. ""Did you see it today or did you see what happened in other years. You couldn't have seen it today because nothing happened. ""The worst of everything is the attitude of Chiellini. He's a great player, with an enormous status. It doesn't correspond with Italian football. As sportsmen leaving the field, crying and appealing against a rival. As a man he disappointed me totally."" Diego Godin's 81st minute header secured victory for Uruguay against an Italian team which played the final half hour with 10-men after Claudio Marchisio was sent off. The defeat led to Italian coach Cesare Prandelli offering his resignation in his news conference after the game -- but all eyes were still on Suarez. The Uruguayan, who plays his club football with Liverpool, was banned for 10 games in April 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. He was also guilty of biting during his time in the Netherlands with Ajax where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of Otman Bakkal. Suarez's rap sheet is lengthy. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he deliberately handled the ball on the goal-line to deny Ghana a place in the semifinals of the World Cup. He was sent off for his troubles but Ghana missed the penalty and Uruguay went on to finish fourth in the tournament. The following year after his move to Liverpool, Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. He was fined $63,000 and banned for eight matches. Last week, after scoring both goals in his side's 2-1 victory over England, Suarez hit out at the British media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions. ""Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,"" he told reporters following the game. ""I want to see what they think now. I have dreamed of this moment."" Suarez enjoyed a sensational season with Liverpool -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the Champions League. He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists' Player of the Year too -- awards that reflected a feeling that Suarez had put behind him his troubled past. His participation in the World Cup had looked in danger when he suffered a knee injury in Liverpool's final game of the season. He was forced to undergo keyhole surgery and missed Uruguay's opening game defeat by Costa Rica before making a near miraculous return in time to face England just five weeks after his operation, scoring both goals in the South American side's 2-1 win. Uruguay's next game will be against Colombia on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro. Meanwhile, Italy coach Prandelli says he will step down following another World Cup disappointment. Prandelli, who replaced Marcello Lippi as coach in 2010, also failed to guide Italy out of the group stage in South Africa four years ago. ""At the end of the match I spoke to the president of the federation, I have told them I am going to resign from my position,"" he told reporters. ""When there is failure, the person in charge must take responsibility,"" added Prandelli, who only extended his contract last month. Giancarlo Abete, the president of the Italian Football Federation, also announced his resignation while stating he hoped to convince Prandelli to stay on. In the group's other game, Costa Rica sealed top spot with a goalless draw against England. Los Ticos, which won both of its previous games, will play Greece in its next game in Recife on Sunday.

"(EW.com ) -- In Brett Ratner's adaptation of Steve Moore's 2008 graphic novel, ""Hercules,"" as played by Dwayne Johnson, is a world-weary mercenary who allows others to believe — and perhaps embellish — his heroic tales. Travelling with a Magnificent Seven-style band of warriors who are lured by riches to defend the beleaguered kingdom of Lord Cotys (John Hurt), the mighty man is still haunted by nightmares of the three-headed Cerberus, and he mourns the murder of his wife and children — though there are those who whisper that he himself killed them. When Johnson is wearing the head of the slayed Nemean lion in battle, walloping enemies with his tree-trunk sized club, and heaving charging horses to the ground with remarkable ease, he's in his Rock comfort zone. But as a tortured hero hampered by self-doubt, Johnson labors. He's aiming for the gravitas of Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"" and Gerard Butler in ""300,"" but he races through the moments where Hercules has to be vulnerable or jaded. And since he's the lone person in B.C. Thrace — a city-state populated by Ian McShane, Joseph Fiennes, and Rufus Sewell — who didn't go to British boarding school, his careful enunciation sounds especially out of place.

"Houston, Texas (CNN)  -- The judge that BP wants to hear an estimated 200 lawsuits over the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster gets tens of thousands of dollars a year in oil royalties and is paid travel expenses to industry conferences, financial disclosure forms show. Lawyers who practice before U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes say he's tough but fair, and a CNN review of his cases found he ruled in favor of oil companies only slightly more often than he ruled against them. But his connections to the industry have raised eyebrows at a time when BP is under fire for the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Federal financial disclosure forms obtained by CNN show that since 2003, Hughes has consistently been paid annual fees from the oil and gas industry, mostly in the form of lease payments for wells and mineral rights on land he owns. None of the payments comes from BP, but his holdings include mutual funds that draw income from Anadarko Petroleum, a minority owner in the well now pouring up to 2.5 million gallons a day into the Gulf. In some cases, the amounts are significant. In others, the payments are relatively small. Oil giant ConocoPhillips paid him between $50,000 and $100,000 in 2008, the last year in which records are publicly available. In a note attached to the 2008 form, Hughes said he expected the amounts to be relatively similar for 2009. He gets smaller amounts from smaller producers such as Sun Oil, Everest Oil and Wagner Oil, which pay for the right to drill oil and gas from lands he owns. The federal disclosure form does not require exact amounts, only estimates and approximate figures. A legal expert on ethics, Indiana University professor Charles Geyh, told CNN that judges with financial ties to the oil industry should make their connections crystal clear. ""When you take it together, is there a concern that a reasonable person might say, 'Look-it, he's not a judge that happens to be dabbling -- he's in effect a participant in the industry he's trying to judge,' "" Geyh said. Hughes has been sitting on the federal bench in Houston since the mid-1980s, and BP has asked that he supervise all of the estimated 200 cases filed against it since the April sinking of the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon. The sinking left 11 workers dead and uncorked a gusher that has been fouling the Gulf for more than eight weeks. In court filings in early May, BP requested Hughes be assigned to preside over the spill lawsuits because he already was assigned to one of the first cases, a lawsuit filed on behalf of Vietnamese-American fishermen from Louisiana. According to an e-mail sent to CNN, BP said the judge ""is an appropriate choice to provide oversight of these cases."" The Department of Justice has asked that the suits be consolidated in New Orleans, Louisiana, the closest federal court to the spill. The sinking took place in the waters off southeastern Louisiana, about 40 miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River. BP would not comment on Hughes' financial disclosures. But the judge has held two recent meetings in Houston to discuss possible ethics concerns, a lawyer who attended those meetings told CNN. ""In both of those hearings, the questions have been raised about whether or not he should preside over these cases or whether there will be a conflict,"" Mark Lanier, a prominent Houston plaintiff attorney, told CNN. ""In the second one, the judge explained he had listed online all of his financial disclosure information, so people would be able to look at and probe."" One particular case over which Hughes presided in 2009 is raising questions. In 2008, Hughes listed royalty payments from about 10 wells leased to Devon Energy, an Oklahoma City-based oil and gas company. The amounts were relatively small -- under $15,000, according to his disclosure form -- and a source told CNN the payments were for a collection of nine or 10 wells scattered in land across two or three states. In May of 2009, Hughes issued a favorable decision for Devon Energy in a dispute with its insurance company. According to an attorney for the insurance firm, the total amount was $3.9 million. Court records show that Hughes did not disclose his royalty payments from Devon at any point during the proceedings. No one claims the judge has violated the federal code of judicial ethics, but Geyh says appearances matter. ""I think the best practice that is out there, and I think what judges across the country are encouraged to do, is that if there is any doubt, put some sunshine on the problem,"" he said. ""Turn your cards face up, to mix metaphors, and make it clear to the parties what your potential interests are."" Hughes also travels widely and speaks to meetings held by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, including one held in early June in the Canadian city of Calgary and an earlier conference in Cape Town, South Africa. He's the association's distinguished lecturer on ethics, having delivered 10 speeches to the trade group in the past three years. The association doesn't pay him a fee but does supply his travel, accommodation and expenses, said Larry Nation, a spokesman for the trade group. Federal judges rarely respond to requests for comment from journalists. But Hughes told CNN in an e-mail that while he couldn't speak to past or present cases, he did quote Thomas Jefferson: ""Let facts be submitted to a candid world,"" he wrote. Lawyers who know him call Hughes a tough but fair judge and say the reference is to a desire for transparency on his part. But attorneys for environmental advocacy groups say that for BP to request Hughes be assigned to the spill lawsuits is ""outrageous and unseemly."" CNN examined three years of Hughes' rulings on oil and gas cases, finding he ruled in favor of oil companies only slightly more often than ruling against them. As for other federal judges, a recent survey showed more than 20 federal judges across the Gulf states have a financial interest in oil and gas companies. Several of them have recused themselves from presiding over cases related to the Gulf spill. Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Ten U.S. Muslim organizations threatened this week to cease working with the FBI, citing ""McCarthy-era tactics"" by the agency, including efforts to covertly infiltrate California mosques. Stephen Tidwell, then of the FBI's Los Angeles office, speaks at the Islamic Center of Irvine in 2006. The groups claim the FBI has sent undercover agents posing as worshippers into mosques, pressured Muslims to become informants, labeled civil rights advocates as criminals and spread misinformation. The FBI declined to comment on specific allegations but called the proposed move unproductive. ""Limiting honest dialogue, especially when complex issues are on the table, is generally not an effective advocacy strategy,"" spokesman John Miller said in a statement. ""The FBI has continued our outreach efforts, across the board, with a number of concerned groups and where we agree -- or disagree -- most have concluded the best results are achieved through continued conversation. We believe that, too."" The group's statement, dated Tuesday, said several incidents of the FBI ""targeting Muslim Americans lead us to consider suspending ongoing outreach efforts."" The statement was issued by the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections, whose director, Agha Saeed, couldn't immediately comment because of a family emergency. The FBI has sent ""agents provocateur"" into California mosques, according to the statement, which says an FBI agent threatened to make one mosque member's life a ""living hell"" if he did not become an informant. Though the statement does not name the mosque member, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said last month it would seek an investigation into the February 21 arrest of Ahmadullah Niazi, an Afghanistan native. ""Mr. Niazi previously reported to [CAIR's Los Angeles office] and other community members that, during a raid of a friend's house, an FBI agent urged Mr. Niazi to work with the agency, saying that if he refused to cooperate his life would be made a 'living hell,' "" a news release said. Niazi, a member of the Islamic Center of Irvine, told CAIR his arrest was retaliation for his refusal, the release said. The FBI directed questions about Niazi's arrest to the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, California, which declined comment. Niazi, 34, was indicted last month on charges of perjury, procuring naturalization unlawfully, using a passport procured by fraud and making false statements. A search warrant for Niazi's Tustin, California, home said Niazi became a naturalized citizen in 2004 and made false statements about his past aliases and international travel. He also made false statements about contact with his brother-in-law Amin ul-Haq, the indictment said. Ul-Haq is said to be Osama bin Laden's security coordinator and has been labeled a ""specially designated global terrorist"" by the U.S. government, the indictment said. An FBI agent said in open court that Niazi also had discussed terrorist plots with an undercover informant, according to media reports. Niazi has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. CAIR's problems with the FBI began before Niazi's arrest. Last year, the FBI discontinued its ""formal contact"" with CAIR. The Tuesday statement said the FBI unjustly designated CAIR and other organizations as ""unindicted co-conspirators"" in the Holy Land Foundation case. A jury convicted Holy Land Foundation leaders last year of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for a terrorist group. ""Making this unjust designation public violates the Justice Department's own guidelines and wrongly implies that those listed are somehow involved in criminal activity,"" the statement said. The FBI's Miller declined to comment on specifics, but said the FBI wants to avoid ""formally constructed partnerships"" with CAIR. ""Our concerns relate to a number of distinct narrow issues specific to CAIR and its national leadership,"" Miller said. Before the FBI severed formal ties, CAIR officials had met with the FBI to discuss hate crimes targeting Muslims. On occasion, CAIR offered assistance in investigations. The group also held training sessions for FBI agents on Islamic culture and ways to improve interactions with the Muslim community. CAIR this week called the FBI allegations a ""campaign of smears and misinformation,"" a remnant of the Bush administration. ""It is not surprising that we would be targeted in a purely political move by those in the previous administration who sought to prevent us from defending the civil rights of American Muslims,"" said a statement from the group's national communications director, Ibrahim Hooper. Tuesday's group statement also mentioned ""a flourishing of anti-Muslim activity"" during the previous administration and expressed fear that ""counterintelligence programs are quelling lawful dissent."" Unless the FBI affords fair treatment to all mosques, Muslims and Muslim groups, the statement said, Muslims should consider suspending ties to the agency. ""This possible suspension, of course, would in no way affect our unshakable duty to report crimes or threats of violence to our nation,"" it said.","Ten Muslim groups say they may suspend ties with FBI .

"Washington (CNN) -- There weren't any starlets or red carpet, but the Library of Congress had a blockbuster day at the movies on Thursday. The government of Russia presented the Library of Congress with digitally preserved copies of 10 silent films that previously had been thought to be lost forever. According to the Library of Congress, more than 80 percent of American movies from 1893-1930 -- also known as the ""silent era"" -- no longer exist in the United States. Like today's movies that are distributed to theaters around the world, many of those early silent films were circulated internationally. Over the past 20 years, the Library of Congress has discovered some of the missing films in international libraries and archives, like the Gosfilmofond, the Russian state film archive. ""A study published by the Library of Congress in 1993 concluded that the majority of U.S. movies from the 1920s survive only in foreign film archives,"" said Librarian of Congress James Billington. He went on to explain that in the days of early American movie-making, many studios and theaters simply threw old movies away. Russia, he explained didn't generally throw them away. Many of the films sat in storage, making it possible for them to be preserved for restoration today. Caroline Frick, curator of motion pictures at the George Eastman House museum of photography and film in Rochester, New York, said such film repatriation projects are exciting, with ""a huge array of film history that still remains unknown because so many of the films don't exist."" Frick explained that Russia's digital preservation of American silent films is an example of how film preservation itself has changed, especially in the last 10 years. ""It used to be that you preserved on film but now we have a multitude of ways, including making digital copies so that the images are preserved."" Included in the restored movies is a 1923 film staring then-child-star Jackie Coogan, called ""Circus Days,"" about a boy who runs away from his uncle to join the circus; and ""Canyon of the Fools,"" starring Western movie star Harry Carey. Billington accepted the digitally preserved movies on hard drives presented by Vladimir Kozhin, head of Russia's Presidential Management and Administration Department, at a ceremony Thursday. These ten films are the first of hundreds that will be repatriated over time. The ten films presented Thursday, their studios and production year include: . -- ""Valley of the Giants"" (Famous Players, 1919) -- ""You're Fired"" (Famous Players, 1919) -- ""The Conquest of Canaan"" (Famous Players, 1921) -- ""Kick In"" (Famous Players, 1922) -- ""The Call of the Canyon"" (Famous Players, 1923) -- ""Canyon of the Fools"" (R-C Pictures, 1923) -- ""Circus Days"" (First National, 1923) -- ""The Eternal Struggle"" (Metro Pictures, Louis B. Mayer, 1923) -- ""The Arab"" (Metro, 1924) -- ""Keep Smiling"" (Monty Banks, 1925)","It's estimated that 80 percent of Hollywood's silent-era films no longer exist in the U.S.

"Don Bohning is a former Latin America editor for The Miami Herald and author of ""The Castro Obsession: U.S. Covert Operations Against Cuba 1959-1965,"" published by Potomac Books in 2005. Cuban President Fidel Castro poses for a photograph last month in Havana. (CNN) -- Before disappearing from public life in 2006 and officially stepping down as Cuba's president Tuesday, Fidel Castro ruled the country with an iron fist, despite numerous attempts by his enemies to do away with him. The CIA-directed April 1961 invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to U.S. government efforts to rid Cuba of Castro. They began with his rise to power in 1959 and continued through the mid-1960s. In many cases, those efforts were accompanied by assassination plots, ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime. Some were serious, others were not. Obviously, none succeeded. Most Americans did not learn of these efforts until 1975, when Sen. Frank Church of Idaho conducted hearings on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders. Greater detail became available in 1993 with the declassification of the Report on Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro, a report ordered by President Johnson. It was prepared in 1967 by the CIA's inspector general and made available to the Church Committee but not declassified until 36 years later.  Watch a report on the impact of Castro's resignation » . The Church Committee concluded there were ""at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Castro from 1960 to 1965."" Some, however, never got beyond the talking stage, as indicated by the CIA inspector general's report. They included, before August 1960, plots aimed only at discrediting Castro. • Aerosol attack on radio station Discussion was held on a scheme to contaminate the air of the radio station in Havana where Castro broadcast his speeches with a chemical that produces reactions similar to LSD. Nothing came of the idea. • Contaminated cigars A vague scheme involving a box of cigars treated with a chemical intended to produce temporary personality disorientation or, perhaps, cause his beard to fall out. The source was the late Jake Esterline, the CIA's project director for what became the Bay of Pigs. While vague on his recollections about the intended effect of the cigars, Esterline said he was positive they were not lethal. • Depilatory A scheme involving thallium salt, a chemical used by women as a depilatory, placed in his shoes. The idea was to cause Castro's beard to fall out, thus damaging his image. • Gambling syndicate -- Phase I (August 1960 - May 1961) A complicated assassination plot initiated by Richard Bissell, involving Mafia figures Sam Giancani, Santos Trafficante and Johnny Rosselli, who had contacts remaining in Havana from pre-Castro days. It was timed to coincide with the Bay of Pigs invasion, although Bissell, head of CIA covert operations at the time, never bothered to tell either Esterline, the Bay of Pigs project director, nor Marine Col. Jack Hawkins, the project's paramilitary officer. Poison pills were to be delivered to Havana and delivered to a contact inside a restaurant frequented by Castro. No one knows if the pills ever got to Havana. It was called off after the Bay of Pigs. • Gambling syndicate -- Phase II (Late 1961 - June 1963) The same plot involving Mafia figures and poison pills was reactivated in early 1962 as part of the period of Operation Mongoose, the post-Bay of Pigs program to unseat Castro. The pills were given to Tony Varona, a prominent Cuban exile, through Johnny Rosselli, another Mafia figure. Varona then asked for arms and ammunition as well, which were passed to him by the Miami CIA station. The inspector general's report indicates uncertainty as to whether the pills ever made it to Cuba. Schemes in early 1963 . • Skin-diving suit This plot was hatched at the time New York Attorney James Donovan was negotiating with Castro for the release of the Bay of Pigs prisoners. It called for Donovan to present Castro with a skin-diving suit dusted inside with a fungus that would produce a disabling and chronic skin disease and contaminating the breathing apparatus with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The skin-diving suit already had been bought but was abandoned when it was learned Donovan already had given Castro a skin-diving suit on his own initiative. • Booby-trapped seashell The idea was to take an unusually spectacular seashell that would catch Castro's attention, load it with an explosive triggered to blow when the seashell was lifted, and submerge it in an area Castro was known to frequent for skin-diving. The plan progressed so far that Desmond Fitzgerald, then head of the CIA's Cuban operations, bought two books on Caribbean mollusks. It was later decided the scheme was impracticable for a variety of reasons, among them that a midget submarine to have been used in placing the seashell had too short an operating range. • Project Amlash-Rolando Cubela Cubela, whose code name was Amlash, was a member of Castro's inner circle from the beginning. He had become disenchanted and made contact with the CIA as early as 1961. Nestor Sanchez, his CIA case officer, was meeting with Cubela in Paris when President Kennedy was killed in Dallas, Texas, November 22, 1963. Sanchez provided Cubela that day -- at Cubela's request -- a poison pen-syringe to be used either on Castro or on himself, in case of a failed attempt. Nothing happened. As CIA covert operations against Castro began winding down, the Agency put Cubela in touch with Manuel Artime, the exiled chief of a 300-member, CIA-funded exile guerrilla army operating for Central America. The joint Artime-Cubela plan was for Cubela to assassinate Castro when he gave his annual July 26, 1965, speech at Varadero, a beach resort on Cuba's north coast. The assassination would coincide with a seaborne invasion by Artime's forces with the presumed support of several Cuban army officers in the area. The operation was canceled in late June 1965 after it became compromised. E-mail to a friend .","A plot to embarrass Castro suggested chemicals to cause his beard to fall out .

"Editor's note: Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci has overseen research into preventing, diagnosing and treating disease and has made numerous discoveries related to HIV/AIDS. He has received the National Medal of Science, the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. April 25, 2009, is World Malaria Day. Dr. Anthony Fauci says we should aim to eradicate the killer disease of malaria. (CNN) -- For the past few decades when talking about malaria, public health officials and malaria experts have avoided the word ""eradication."" This reluctance is based in part on relatively recent history. In 1955, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a valiant effort to eradicate malaria throughout the world. Although the disease was virtually eliminated in many temperate regions and reduced in some tropical areas, the goal of worldwide eradication fell short, and the effort ultimately was abandoned. Today, malaria has resurged with a vengeance. Half the world's population is at risk of malaria infection. Approximately 250 million people get sick with malaria each year and nearly a million individuals die -- mostly young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. So when Bill and Melinda Gates dared to resurrect the ""E"" word in 2007, many in the public health community were skeptical and said in private conversation, ""It can't be done."" We at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initially leaned toward the views of the large chorus of ""eradication skeptics,"" but as the idea began to sink in and we assessed the research landscape, a new sense of optimism emerged. We now believe that malaria eradication -- controlling and eliminating the malaria parasite in every region across the globe -- is possible, but only if we learn from history and our past mistakes. Previous efforts to eradicate malaria failed for several reasons, including political instability and technical challenges in delivering resources, especially in certain countries in Africa. The goal of malaria eradication, although popular among physicians and public health workers, did not muster sustained widespread support among the general public. The diversity of malaria in communities across the globe and the changes in tools and monitoring strategies required over time to achieve eradication were not fully appreciated. And the impact and sustainability of single interventions such as the drug chloroquine and the pesticide DDT were overestimated. Inevitably, malaria parasites developed resistance to commonly used drugs and mosquito vectors became insecticide-resistant. Unfortunately, investments in the research needed to develop new tools was never really adequate. And a sustainable yet flexible infrastructure to deliver the treatment and preventive services that could respond to a changing epidemiology was never developed. It is now widely recognized that any attempt at malaria eradication must be a long-term commitment that involves multiple interventions, disciplines, strategies and organizations. One of the means to develop important new tools critical for the eradication of malaria is through biomedical research. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recognizes that malaria eradication will require a sustained, multidisciplinary research effort by multiple partners across the globe. Indeed, we are a part of a global initiative recently launched by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation called the Malaria Eradication Research and Development Agenda involving research sponsors, public health agencies and interested organizations throughout the world joined by the common collaborative goal of malaria eradication. As we work toward controlling and eliminating malaria in endemic regions of the world, it will be important to monitor shifts in disease patterns as we achieve success. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes may die out in some regions, but reappear in others. Certain drugs may be successful in reducing the burden and controlling the spread of the malaria parasite, but other parasites may soon emerge to reintroduce or resume the disease. Such changes in the patterns of the disease will require new interventions: diagnostics, drugs and ultimately an effective vaccine. Thus, we must maintain a robust pipeline of new interventions that can substitute for failing ones. In developing a research plan for controlling, eliminating and eventually eradicating malaria, we are confronted by substantial challenges. An immediate challenge is diagnosis. Different species of the malaria parasite exist, and it is important to have sensitive and rapid diagnostics that can detect which species are infecting patients and whether they are resistant to standard malaria drug regimens so that the optimal drugs are administered. As our successes mount, we also will need rapid new diagnostics to detect infected individuals with no symptoms who might re-introduce the parasite into areas where the disease has been controlled or eliminated. A second challenge will be to translate the enormous wealth of basic information about malaria parasites, mosquito vectors and the human host into new intervention strategies. For example, we now know the genetic sequences from Anopheles gambiae, the most important mosquito species for spreading malaria, and for the two major malaria parasites of humans: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. It is a daunting task to translate this information into better ways of blocking transmission and preventing and treating infection. Finally, perhaps our greatest challenge is sustaining our research efforts until the ultimate eradication of malaria. We may run the risk of becoming victims of our own success. Once we find ways to reduce the disease burden and deaths due to malaria, the world may no longer perceive malaria as a major threat and may lose interest. Celebrities, politicians and even health officials may focus their attention on other maladies that pose a more immediate threat. We cannot allow this to happen. Unless we want to face the persistence and even resurgence of malaria in the next century and beyond, we must maintain our resolve to fully eradicate this deadly scourge across the globe. It can be done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony S. Fauci.","Dr. Anthony Fauci: Eradicating malaria was dismissed as impossible .
He says a reassessment shows the disease can be wiped out over time .

"(CNN) -- There was so much -- so! much! -- to love about Sunday night's Golden Globe awards. To begin with, Amy Poehler finally won something (much to her astonishment), and she did it while killing her hosting job with Tina Fey. Over on our Golden Globes live blog, we asked those watching with us how Fey and Poehler were doing, and 81% voted they were doing A-OK, with roughly half that saying the duo were even better than last year. That's great news for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, since they've already booked Fey and Poehler for a third round of Globes. The comedic team were just as sharp as they were last year, although we're curious who you think had the best one-liners. These were some of our favorite jokes of the night: . Tina Fey, introducing ""Gravity"" during the opening monologue: "" 'Gravity' is nominated for best film. It's the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age."" Amy Poehler, calling out Netflix for breaking through with its original shows: ""Enjoy it while it lasts, Netflix. You're not going to be feeling so smug in a couple of years when SnapChat is up here accepting best drama."" Tina Fey, on Meryl Streep: ""(She's) so brilliant in 'August: Osage County,' proving that there are still great roles in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60."" Amy Poehler introducing one of Showtime's new hit shows: "" 'Masters of Sex,' which is the degree I got from Boston College."" When Tina and Amy accused Julia Louis-Dreyfus of becoming a diva: ""Interestingly, Julia has chosen to sit in the film section tonight. Hi, Julia. Hi, Julia ... you know us from TV."" Amy Poehler as Tina Fey's ""adult son from a previous relationship"" (who sadly didn't know his dad): . Amy Poehler's heartwarming acceptance speech: . Tina Fey, introducing Leonardo DiCaprio: ""Like a supermodel's vagina, let's all give a warm welcome to Leonardo DiCaprio."" Those were some of the jokes that caused us to laugh the hardest.

"(CNN) -- European colonies might seem to belong to the age of empires, Napoleon, galleon ships and spice trading. But there remains a handful of captivating islands scattered in the remote fringes of the Caribbean, Pacific and Atlantic that still belong to some of the world's more powerful nations. St. Pierre and Miquelon . Officially: Overseas Collectivity of France . Located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the tiny islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon changed hands frequently between the British and the French in the 1700s. They finally settled in Gallic hands after Napoleon's second abdication in 1815. With peat bogs, rugged hills and a now struggling fishing industry, the last time the islands made headlines was during the Prohibition era, when they briefly became a hub of alcohol smuggling into the United States. These days tourism plays a large role in keeping this ""department"" of France alive. ""I remember the ferry ride and the young school children vomiting with seasickness,"" says Canadian travel blogger Candice Walsh, who traveled there from Newfoundland via a one-hour ferry trip. ""Then: stepping onto the pier, the whole downtown area opening up with colorful storefronts, old French-styled architecture and adorable little European cars. ""English is barely spoken, and European voltage replaces North American standards. Euros are the currency."" For the 6,300 residents, a hefty $65 million subsidy from Paris is even more important in enabling civilization here to continue. If you make the trip, you can expect a French-ness that is absolute, from the liqueur stores selling Bordeaux and Burgundy to lace curtains and bijou patisseries selling croissants and pastries. More information is available from the St. Pierre and Miquelon official website. Air Saint-Pierre services the islands from St. John's (Newfoundland), Halifax and Montreal in Canada. Guam . Officially: Unincorporated Territory of the United States . Coral reefs, waterfalls, brown tree snakes and a local obsession with Spam, Guam is the most southerly and largest of the Mariana Islands located in the western Pacific Ocean. A major military asset of the United States, there are huge Navy and Air Force installations here and the surrounding oceans are used by the U.S. military for war game simulations. For visitors, many of whom come from Japan, there's plenty to do despite the high troop presence. Huge underwater coral craters teem with stingrays and are a draw to divers. The food is a unique fusion of Spanish, Mexican and native Chamorro influences -- spicy dishes featuring tortillas, soy, corn bread and coconut. Food plays a big role in the fiestas in Guam, which take place throughout the year. ""In the South, you don't need to be invited, you can just show up and go to all the different family's homes holding fiestas,"" says Antonia, who writes the blog iquitmyjobandmovedtoguam.com. ""One guy [told me], 'You can't call yourself an islander until you've eaten these three things. 1. Red rice 2. Dried beef 3. Local crab.' Another said, 'You can't ever lose weight in Guam and no one is ever skinny.'"" Beaches feature almost blindingly white sands. The sheer cliff edge known as Two Lovers Point is a hugely popular wedding venue for tourists; legend has it that two lovers, forbidden from being together by their parents, threw themselves off the edge into the Philippine Sea. More information is available from the official Visit Guam website. Korean Air flies from Incheon Airport to Guam. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines fly to Guam from Honolulu. Niue . Officially: Self-governing state in free association with New Zealand . You can't get much more remote than Niue (pronounced new-way), gloriously isolated in the South Pacific Ocean, some 1,500 miles to the northeast of New Zealand. This tiny coral reef (known as a ""maketa"" island) is home to barely 1,500 people, just a fraction of the total number of Niueans, many of whom have migrated to New Zealand, with whom it operates in ""free association."" This means, in a slightly different arrangement to an overseas territory, New Zealand, under the island's constitution, must provide ""necessary economic and administrative assistance"" to Niue. The underwater chasms, ravines and gullies here make for great scuba diving. Humpback whales often pass by and, despite the lack of beach (the oval-shaped island rises sharply out of the ocean), there's still a handful of restaurants and bars overlooking the vast Pacific that serve Polynesian specialties including coconut crab, breadfruit, cassava and shellfish. ""There are only 100 rooms for accommodation on the island, and estimates say that Niue only sees about 2,000 tourists a year,"" says travel blogger Joshua Foster, who visited in 2009. ""This creates a completely unique atmosphere on the island -- locals know tourism is important for their economy, yet the tourism numbers are still small enough that the locals are genuinely happy to see travelers. ""It is far and away the most friendly place I have ever been."" More information is available from the Niue Tourism Office website. Air New Zealand flies to Niue from Auckland twice a week. Gibraltar . Officially: British Overseas Territory . A source of near constant friction between Britain and Spain, the tiny enclave of Gibraltar on Spain's far southern coast was granted to the UK in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 -- it remains the only overseas territory Britain possesses in Europe. For Brits, it's by far the easiest of all the remaining British overseas territories to visit -- even budget airlines fly here from London). The formerly vital naval base (it's now a hub of offshore finance) is home to nearly 30,000 British subjects. If the retro pubs serving full fried English breakfasts in the soaring Mediterranean heat don't appeal, there's plenty to explore on the colossal Rock of Gibraltar. It's inhabited by a huge population of Barbary macaque monkeys and miles of tunnels on and in the Rock, dug out during the 19th century by locals to protect the territory during a siege by the French and Spanish, who were trying to wrestle it out of British hands. Despite the tensions, Gibraltar's place on the world sporting stage got a boost in 2013 when its team was admitted to Europe's governing football body UEFA. This means that, as the continent's smallest competing team, Gibraltar will be in the hunt to qualify for the 2016 European Championships in France. More information is available at the official Gibraltar Tourist Board website. Easyjet flies to Gibraltar from London Gatwick. Saba . Officially: Special Municipality of the Netherlands . Ferns, elfin forests, tropical flowers and mahogany trees, Saba is one of the quietest and least visited islands in the Caribbean. It's one of three Caribbean islands administered as ""special municipalities"" of Holland from The Hague. Along with Bonaire and St. Eustatius, Saba draws a small yet committed bunch of visitors who come for the diving amid coral reefs teeming with groupers, turtles and the odd shark. By law, all the houses the 1,500 locals reside in are painted white with red roofs and green shutters. Goats outnumber people by 10 to one, though you'll need more than a little goat-like stubbornness to climb the 1,064 concrete steps that lead to the summit of Mount Scenery. The name isn't a misnomer -- the steps pass through rainforest bulging with mountain palms and elephant ear ferns and the view from the top on a clear day is sublime. Better still, the only company you're likely to be sharing the view with are hummingbirds, iguanas and the odd (harmless) racer snake. More information is available from the official Saba Tourist Bureau website. Winair flies from St. Maarten to Saba daily. The flight takes just 12 minutes. Tristan da Cunha . Officially: British Overseas Territory . Forget what the people of the Galapagos tell you, this is the most remote inhabited place on the entire planet -- a volcanic island in the South Atlantic 1,750 miles from the nearest populated place, Cape Town, South Africa. The reasons for the 260 British subjects (who share six surnames between them) residence here are bizarre. When Napoleon was exiled to St. Helena (another British territory in the Atlantic) a small band of British soldiers was stationed on Tristan to prevent the island being used as part of any escape attempt. Their descendants now comprise the population, which was evacuated to southern England in 1961 after the volcano erupted. They returned the next year, preferring their island to city life. ""Tristan da Cunha is definitely not the most exotic island to travel to, but if you want to escape the chaos of the big city and experience life in a small, friendly community, you probably won't find a better place,"" writes Florin Nedelcu, who blogs for hotelclub.com. The chances of the diminutive tyrant fleeing via here back to France were always pretty remote -- Tristan is thousands of miles in the wrong direction from Paris. Today, the main industry is the export of crayfish. There are no hotels, no airstrips, just one pub (the Albatross Inn) and, if you want to get here, you'll have to either snag a place on the few South African fishing vessels that pass by or book a berth on the RMS St. Helena, Britain's last post boat, which delivers mail to the locals. For more information visit Tristan da Cunha. For details on the schedule of the RMS St. Helena and other vessels that visit check out this official Tristan da Cunha website.

"(CNN) -- IKEA has recalled eight of its children's wall-mounted lamps after one toddler died and another was injured, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday. In each case, the lamp cord was pulled into the crib by the infant, creating the strangulation hazard. Both incidents took place in Europe. There are eight different models involved in the recall: a blue star, a yellow moon, a pink flower, a white flower, a red heart, green bug, a blue seashell and an orange seahorse.

"(CNN) -- When Uncle Si Robertson declared on ""Duck Dynasty"" that ""My favorite color is camo"" it spurred a line of clothing sold to the A&E show's fans, according to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday. But the cable channel's sales of T-shirts, hoodies and other apparel bearing that quote violate a trademark owned by Hajn, a Florida company that was already marketing ""My Favorite Color is Camo"" merchandise, the civil complaint said. The company claims it registered the trademark and put it on shirts, pants, hoodies, hats, magnets, stickers and bumper stickers in 2011, a year before the ""Duck Dynasty"" reality series began airing on A&E. ""A&E's conduct constitutes clear acts of unfair competition that risks considerable consumer confusion in that customers purchasing apparel from A&E believe that these goods are affiliated, sponsored, endorsed or related to Hajn,"" the suit said. ""Alternatively, A&E's conduct constitutes reverse palming off, in that consumers believe that Hajn is selling Duck Dynasty related apparel."" Hajn lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to A&E in early June, but the network is still marketing the men's, women's and children's clothing with the trademarked slogan, the lawsuit said. A&E sells the apparel through merchandising deals with retail outlets such as Sears, Wal-Mart, Kohl's, Sports Authority and Target, as well as online, the complaint said. ""A&E generated $400 million in revenues from sales of Duck Dynasty branded merchandise at Wal-Mart in 2013 alone,"" the suit said.

"Gaza City (CNN) -- After weeks of fighting and hundreds of deaths, some semblance of peace may be coming to the Middle East -- at least temporarily. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced Thursday that an unconditional humanitarian cease-fire will begin at 8 a.m. Friday in Gaza (1 a.m. ET). It will last 72 hours -- or three days -- ""unless extended,"" the United Nations and United States said in a joint statement. ""During this time, the forces on the ground will remain in place,"" the statement said. Israel has accepted the cease-fire, officials in its prime minister's office texted CNN. So, too, has Hamas, a spokesman for the militant fundamentalist Islamic organization texted. The cease-fire is meant to allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza caught up in the violence, some of whom have seen their neighborhoods hit hard and loved ones killed, hurt or displaced. The aid will include food, care for the injured and burial of the dead. As all this is going on, Israeli and Palestinian officials should be meeting in Cairo to try to reach ""a durable cease-fire,"" the U.N. and U.S. statement said. ""The parties will be able to raise issues of concern in these negotiations."" Will they be able to reach a breakthrough? The past doesn't suggest that is likely, at least anything that will lead to a solution to issues that Israelis and Palestinians have been grappling with for decades. And the animosity between Israel and Hamas, which controls Gaza, runs especially deep, with both sides accusing each other of putting each others civilians at risk. Kerry called the talks -- to be mediated by Egypt and to include a small American delegation -- ""a lull of opportunity ... to try to find a way to ... obtain a sustainable cease-fire,"" while admitting there are ""no guarantees."" As Kerry noted, ""Everyone knows it has not been easy to get to this point, and everyone knows it will not be easy to get beyond this point."" Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat offered similar sentiments on the new talks, which he said will include ""all Palestinian factions"" -- not just Hamas. ""It's a difficult road,"" said the longtime Palestinian official. ""I am hoping against hope that we can (make) every possible effort, with the help of everyone out there, (to) reach a permanent cease-fire."" U.N. official alludes to potential war crimes . The latest round of violence, which started earlier this summer, has been particularly bad. At least 1,452 people have been killed in Gaza, and 8,360 wounded, during the current conflict, Gaza Ministry of Health spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said. That's more than the 1,417 Palestinians that the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said died in the 22 days of Israel's Operation Cast Lead, which spanned 2008 and 2009. Those killed in the ongoing hostilities -- which are tied to the Israeli military's Operation Protective Edge -- include 327 children and 166 women, the Gaza health ministry reports. The bloodshed prompted the United Nations' top human rights official to warn that war crimes may have been committed, accusing Israel of ""deliberate defiance of obligations (to) international law."" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay referred to the shelling of homes, schools, hospitals and U.N. ""premises,"" while insisting, ""We cannot allow this impunity, we cannot allow this lack of accountability to go on."" ""None of this appears, to me, to be accidental,"" Pillay said. The scale of the violence, as well as the international condemnation of it, could drive both sides to peace. But even if it does, some Palestinians -- like Samy Bahraqe, who is in a U.N. camp after her home was destroyed -- aren't looking forward to the future. ""Life is meaningless,"" Bahraqe said. ""... What dreams in life can we have now that everything is ruined?"" More Israeli reservists called up . News of the cease-fire didn't stop the violence. Almost immediately afterward, warning sirens went off around Israel -- with its military announcing later it had intercepted one rocket from Gaza, while two others landed in the Mediterranean Sea. Israel has been protected very effectively from Hamas rockets by its Iron Dome defense system, though a few have hit land. That includes a rocket that struck a neighborhood Thursday in Qiryat Gat, about 20 miles from Gaza, seriously injuring a man and setting a car afire, Israeli spokesman Mikey Rosenfeld said. Three civilians have been killed in Israel since the conflict began, while many more have been forced to take shelter as rockets rained overhead. But the brunt of the conflict has been born by Israel's military, with 61 of its soldiers dying in recent weeks, with five of those deaths occurring Thursday evening. They will get help soon, with Israel Defense Forces announcing the call-up of 16,000 reservists. That will bring the total number of reservists activated since the start of the operation to 86,000, a military spokeswoman said. Israel has accused Hamas of hiding weapons, including rockets, in schools and launching attacks from near shelters -- a fact that, it says, has contributed to civilian deaths. Many outside Israel aren't convinced. Chile, Peru, Brazil and Ecuador have pulled their ambassadors out of Tel Aviv to protest the Israeli offensive. Even the United States -- an ally of Israel -- believes ""the Israelis need to do more"" to prevent civilian deaths, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters. Still, such calls haven't stopped the United States from agreeing to Israel's request to resupply it with several types of ammunition, a U.S. defense official told CNN on condition of anonymity. It's not an emergency sale, the official said. The items being bought include tank rounds and illumination rounds, the Pentagon said. Nor will a cease-fire stop Israel's attempts to destroy Hamas' network of tunnels that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says is the first phase of the demilitarization of Gaza. While ""neither side will advance ... Israel will be able to continue its defensive operations for those tunnels that are behind its lines,"" Kerry explained. 'We are tired, and we have had so much loss of life' Meanwhile, Gaza is reeling. More than 219,000 Palestinians are packed into 86 shelters across Gaza, the U.N. said. That works out to about 12% of all of Gaza's population. Clean water is inaccessible for most. And some 3,600 people have lost their homes. ""We cannot supply electricity"" for hospitals, sewage treatment or domestic use, said Fathi al-Sheikh Khalil, deputy chairman of the Palestinian Energy Natural Resources Authority in Gaza. ""This is a disaster."" Al-Qidra, the Gaza health spokesman, said health care workers are struggling to deal with the relentless stream of dead and wounded. ""The hospitals in Gaza yesterday had a very difficult time. All the hospital morgues were flooding with dead bodies, and the injured were laying on hospital floors because of the lack of hospital beds,"" said al-Qidra. Count Sakher Joham among those Palestinians hoping, praying that the misery ends. The violence forced him to flee his home, with his five children and ""just the clothes on my back."" ""We are tired, and we have had so much loss of life,"" Joham, 32, said of himself and fellow Palestinians. ""We want to live with our children a life of dignity, like the rest of the world.""

"(CNN) -- 2014 is an election year. We know this because, once again, the Democrats are out in force with voices raised, full of outrage, trying to convince women that new laws are needed to ensure that they receive equal pay for equal work. Equal pay for equal work. Sounds pretty simple, right? We all agree that a woman doing the same job as a man should not be paid less just because she's a woman. Unfortunately, the broader issue is not that simple. What if one employee has more education? What if that employee has been with the company longer or has more experience? These are questions that courts have been mediating since 1963 as companies have faced lawsuits over gender discrimination with regard to wages. Why 1963? Because that is when the Equal Pay Act was signed into law by President John F. Kennedy. The law says that ""no employer shall discriminate between employees on the basis of sex."" And it passed the House that year by a 362-9 vote. That's right, nine Democrats voted against it. Democrats highlight equal pay in political push . For the past two election cycles, Democrats have tried to paint Republicans as backward cavemen on this issue as part of their so-called ""War on Women,"" claiming that Republicans don't care about women because they opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Act. Never mind that the Ledbetter Act had little to do with the premise of equal pay for equal work and everything to do with the time limit for trial lawyers looking to exploit a potential claim. Democrats consistently ignore data from neutral sources that indicates that when you actually compare men and women with the same background and education doing the same job, equality of pay has been largely achieved. PayScale, a compensation data company, has shown that in careers from software developer to nursing to construction project manager to human resources administrator, women are within 1% to 4% of men in terms of pay equity. Obama to strengthen equal pay protections . However, much of the research on women voters in recent years supports the notion that women believe that men get paid more for the same job than women do. There are several reasons for this: 1) personal experience, 2) friend to friend examples and 3) Democrat politicians with manufactured data perpetuating it. So what is a Republican candidate to do? First, every Republican should affirm, without hesitation, support for the concept of equal pay for equal work. There should be no perceived daylight between Republicans and Democrats on this basic value. Democrats seize on equal pay as midterm issue . Second, every Republican should remind voters that they support the Equal Pay Act. They should affirm that, had they been in Congress at the time, they would have voted to pass it and that the only ""nay"" votes recorded that day came from Democrats. And Republicans should remind women that if they are not receiving the equal pay that they deserve, the law is on their side and that bad actors should be vigorously prosecuted. Third, all Republicans should know their facts. Be prepared to challenge the media and their opponents when they try to claim that some new piece of legislation is necessary to ensure equal pay. Not every problem in America can be fixed by Washington. Every disparity that exists in the workplace is not an opportunity for a new piece of legislation. Fourth, every Republican should celebrate companies that have decided it is good business to have a diverse workplace. We should applaud those that have gone out of their way to attract women and give them a rich and robust work experience. And there are plenty of great examples in the Forbes list, ""The 10 Best Companies for Women in 2014"": . -- IBM, which has a Reconnections Initiative that tries to bring women who left to have children back to IBM. -- Marriott, which has an impressive 55% female workforce and 58% female management team. -- Ernst & Young, which has a mentorship program where senior level women pursue opportunities on behalf of younger women within the company. As we celebrate these success stories and condemn bad actors, workplace experiences for all women will improve. Finally, all Republicans should support initiatives to encourage young girls to enter traditionally male-dominated fields such as science, technology, engineering and math. These important STEM fields are crucial to our country's future and provide incredible opportunities for women to achieve high earnings. As of last month, there were 4.7 million unemployed women in this country. What is sad indeed is the willingness by Democrat candidates to use the issue of pay equity as a political football to change the subject from that sobering statistic and the fact that women can't keep their insurance plans or their doctors because the promise of Obamacare turned out to be a lie. These are the real challenges facing women today. But the truth can be inconvenient when it doesn't fit into the Democrats' narrative of a trumped up ""War on Women."" Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Katie Packer Gage says Democrats use the pay equity issue as a political football .
Republicans, she argues, can take five steps to combat the ploy .

"(CNN) -- The sun is putting on a fireworks show again. NASA cameras captured images of what the agency is calling at least two ""significant"" solar flares. The first one peaked at 7:42 a.m. ET Tuesday, followed by a second, lesser blast at 8:52 a.m. ET. The short-lived explosions were expected to disrupt high-frequency radio communications on Earth, although NASA scientists said they pose no threat to humans. Even with all its power, the sun doesn't have enough energy to hurl a fireball 93 million miles at the Earth. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation that send gases, plasma and other matter into the solar system. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to affect humans, but when intense enough, the explosions can disturb GPS and communications signals, NASA said. The first flare was classified as an X2.2 flare, which is unusually bright. Scientists classify solar flares by size, in much the same way they do tornadoes or earthquakes: X-class flares are the biggest and are major events that can trigger planetwide radio blackouts; M-class flares are medium-size ones; and C-class flares are small, with few noticeable consequences here on Earth. The number after the letter provides more information about a flare's strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, and so on. A huge flare can be many times larger than the Earth. The second flare Tuesday was classified as an X1.5 flare. The images were captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which typically observes the entire sun 24 hours a day. Solar flares are not uncommon, as such activity has been increasing in recent years. NASA has recorded a handful of large- and medium-size flares already in 2014, although few were as bright as the first one Tuesday morning. To see more about how the flares may affect Earth, visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center, the U.S. government's official source for space weather forecasts and alerts.","NASA releases images of ""significant"" solar flares Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Big, big sigh of relief among Russia's super-rich, as the West announces ""smart sanctions"" against a group of Kremlin officials and members of Russian parliament in response to the referendum that took place in Crimea and produced a result resembling the elections in the old Soviet Union: 96.7% of the people who took part in it voted for the peninsula to become part of Russia. The joke on the streets of Moscow is that the politicians took the bullet for the oligarchs, not for the first time and not the last. But jokes aside, the fate of Crimea is sealed. It will become part of Russia in about three months' time and, as things stand now, President Vladimir Putin has already signed an executive order recognizing the peninsula as an independent state, confirming his determination to stick to his guns in his address to the Federal Assembly. The Russian leader has gone way too far in his attempt to prevent Crimea -- with two thirds of its population made up of ethnic Russians -- from sliding into mayhem to pull back now, sanctions or no sanctions. It would have been political suicide for him to remain idle in the face of what had happened in Kiev last month. Most Western leaders obviously understood that, even though their rhetoric did not show it. In fact, most if not all Western leaders are probably thanking their lucky stars they have to deal with Mr Putin in the Kremlin and not some die-hard nationalist who would be dreaming of a revival of the former Soviet empire, flexing military muscles with frightening regularity. No-one wants Cold War . So, the so-called ""smart sanctions,"" which have been announced by Washington and Brussels in response to events in Crimea were an anti-climax and a confirmation of a total lack of any desire on the part of the West to take the fight with Russia any further. Sure, a bit of posturing and tough talking never hurt the opinion polls at home, but there are more important things than dragging out the dust covered Cold War from the cupboard and losing out on business deals, while having all that lovely Russian money flowing to the West dry up. The Cold War is very 1960s, you know, and no one really wants it to come back. The debate about the legality of the referendum in Crimea will ramble on for a while but it is very difficult to imagine how the result can now be reversed. From the Russian side of the fence, in case you're wondering, the plebiscite in Crimea was a logical response to the overthrow of the democratically elected regime of President Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev -- albeit with its incompetence and corruption -- and the country finding itself with a bunch of opportunists in charge and some pretty rough characters from the far-right acting as their enforcers, saying nasty things about Russia from the word go. No wonder then that Moscow shrugged all accusations that the Crimean referendum was illegal coming from Kiev and the West, saying: ""Look who's talking!"" At the moment, all the Kremlin officials and members of parliament mentioned in the lists provided by Washington and Brussels are putting on a brave face and saying that they see it as a privilege and an honor to be in them, pointing out that they don't keep any money or own any assets abroad. Not in their own names they don't, because about a year ago a law had been passed in Russia that no governments officials and members of parliament were allowed to have foreign accounts and own properties abroad. So a transformation of ownership had taken place and it would be pretty hard to figure out who owns what and where. And in case anyone is wondering how then politicians and the servants of the people generally keep their wealth hidden, be it in Russia or in the West, it's all about trusted people, ""fixers,"" handling it for them. Yes, yes, don't look surprised, democracy, both regulated and without boundaries, has its own well-tested system. Otherwise why would people go into politics at all? Getting personal . Privately some Russian officials are saying that all these lists represent a break with the old tradition of not getting personal during a row. ""No one called for smart sanctions against specific yanks and Brits when they pulled off that invasion of Iraq,"" one angry official in Moscow complained to me. ""And no one was naming names when the war in Libya went all wrong."" Yes, getting personal in politics was always a taboo and this this round boundaries were crossed. So what now? Well, the noises will continue for a while, getting louder when Crimea joins Russia proper. Mind you, the situation may get more complicated if parts of eastern Ukraine start pushing hard for their on referendums on their future with Russia, like the one in Crimea. That is why it's now a good time for both the West and Russia to start finding the way out of this crisis. For everyone's sake. Read more: Putin vs. Obama face off over Crimea facts .

"(CNN) -- After just one day of competition, a new sport has emerged at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow: snapping selfies with the Queen. Australian hockey players Jayde Taylor and Brooke Peris took the early lead with an immaculately-timed shot of the British monarch. #sheevensmiled, Taylor tweeted after the royal run-in, along with the bold claim, #bestphotobombever. The original tweet has inspired a number of copycat attempts, some more successful than others. British hurdler Andy Turner posted his effort with the admission, ""That's as good as it gets, some big bloke told me to jog on so thought it was time I moved."" Selfie pedants have already pointed out the original shot wasn't a true photobomb, the term given to a shot spoiled -- or enhanced -- by someone who's not supposed to be there. The Queen clearly was, with both women admitting they timed the shot, knowing Her Royal Highness was moving into view.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Nancy Dolman, the wife of actor-comedian Martin Short has died, Short's representative said. ""Sadly, we can confirm that Martin Short's wife did pass away,"" Camille Kuznetz said Monday. ""We do not have any other comment to make."" No details about the time, location or cause of Dolman's death were released. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call for emergency medical help at the couple's Pacific Palisades home Saturday morning, LAFD spokesman Brian Humphrey said. Paramedics did not transport anyone from the home, Humphrey said. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office had no record of her death, but the office would only be aware if a death was sudden, unexpected or from unnatural causes, a spokesman said. The couple had three children during their 30-year marriage. Dolman, 58, was a comedic actress and, like Short, a native of Canada. Her acting career included a recurring role on TV's ""Soap"" in the late 1981, although she soon gave up her acting career to raise her children, according to the Internet Movie Database.

"(CNN) -- This was one video Beyonce and Jay Z wanted the world to see. The superstar pair kicked off their highly anticipated joint ""On The Run Tour"" Wednesday night at SunLife Stadium in Miami, Florida, and the usually intensely private couple shared their never-before-seen wedding video and clips of their toddler, Blue Ivy. The video showed the couple getting their infamous matching ring finger tattoos, and fans were able to see for the first time the rapper in his tux and sliding the wedding ring on his beautiful wife's finger. The pair married during an extremely private ceremony in 2008. It stood in sharp contrast to the hotel elevator footage leaked in May that showed Jay Z being pummeled by his wife's sister, Solange Knowles. The trio later released a statement saying ""they both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family."" Their front was even more united Wednesday night, and Billboard said the show was all about Mr. and Mrs. Carter -- minus even an opening act. ""Alternating in the sparse, almost industrial-looking stage, Beyonce and Jay-Z proceeded to take us on a journey of fashion, high-level performance and music, always returning to the central theme of love -- challenged, perhaps, but finally standing strong,"" Billboard wrote. According to site Consequence of Sound, the show boasted a 42-song set list for a 2-hour-plus concert. One fan tweeted, ""BRILLIANT.

"(CNN) -- About 83,000 Defense Department employees and contractors with security clearances to protect the nation's secrets have delinquent federal tax debts totaling $730 million, according to an internal government audit. The findings in the new Government Accountability Office study raise security concerns for the U.S. government. Officials say employees and contractors who have financial problems are top targets of foreign intelligence agents. Federal regulations governing security clearances say that a person ""who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds"" and that indebtedness should be among factors considered when someone applies for a clearance, the GAO study said. But the study found that government agencies in charge of the issue can't readily collect data on tax debt, in part because IRS privacy rules prohibit sharing certain taxpayer data. The GAO study is expected to be released Monday. CNN reviewed a copy prior to the release. The study comes as federal intelligence and law enforcement officials are grappling with ways to tighten access to classified information in the wake of major unauthorized disclosures carried out by insiders cleared to handle the nation's most sensitive secrets. Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, and Bradley Manning, an Army private who now calls herself Chelsea Manning, passed the required background checks to obtain their security clearances. Snowden, under Russian government protection in Moscow, is charged with releasing to reporters millions of NSA surveillance documents. Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act, for releasing thousands of diplomatic cables and military documents. The 83,000 employees and contractors with tax debt in the GAO study are among 3.2 million people who the Pentagon says held or were approved for secret, top secret, SCI [sensitive compartmented information] and interim security clearances from January 2006 to December 2011, the period covered by the GAO study. The $730 million in tax debt was as of June, 30, 2012, the most recent data analyzed by the study. Most accrued their unpaid tax debt after they received their clearances. Of the 83,000 with tax debt, about 4,800 had IRS liens against their property. About 28% or 23,000 of them were subject to wage garnishment and other collection tactics by the IRS to collect taxes owed. According to the GAO, the Pentagon distinguishes between those who are eligible for access to classified information and a smaller subset of those who ""need to know"" and are therefore granted access to classified documents. But even by that measure, the numbers are problematic. The GAO found 26,000 Defense Department employees and contractors with access to classified information owed about $229 million in delinquent tax debt. There are now 5.1 million federal employees and contractors eligible or holding security clearances, a number hard to police, government officials say. The Office Director of National Intelligence, which is developing new procedures to tighten the security clearance procedures, agreed with the GAO's recommendation that tax debt be more readily available to investigators who gather background data on applicants for security clearances. The problem is the government is still struggling with technology that could provide automated tax debt information on applicants at the time of their application and during the time the security clearance is valid, according to the GAO. There are also privacy restrictions that limit what data the IRS can provide on taxpayers. Obama offers populist message on corporate taxes at end of fundraising trip .

"(CNN) -- Doctors frequently tell patients that they have to lose weight. But the majority of them don't know how it feels to be overweight or what it really takes to lose weight. I do. Between my 17th and 19th birthday, I went from overweight teenager to lean adult by losing 99 pounds. I was a happy teenager from a loving family. Food never served as a substitute for happiness in my life, and I had no reason for comfort eating. My mother didn't like fast food and always cooked healthy meals. Knowing that, it seems absurd that I weighed 264 pounds at 16. The reason for my weight gain was simple: I loved food (I still do!), I ate way too much, and I hated exercise. Well, that's not totally true. My friends and I were passionate soccer players -- sometimes I would even start sweating when my Xbox game got too exciting. ""If I don't eat greasy fast-food, stay away from sweet soft drinks and avoid candies, I won't get fat,"" I used to think. So while my brother was having two potatoes, I ate four. He would have enjoyed a glass of milk in the morning if I hadn't already emptied the whole liter. He loved bread with some bacon; I preferred a lot of bacon with some bread. If you eat more calories than your body needs you will gain weight. It's as simple as that. We are constantly told to focus on what we're eating, and yet we forget to think about how much we are eating. Of course, I got bullied for being overweight. When you're fat, you're a target. I struggled with the teasing in the beginning but got used to it very quickly. That was dangerous -- getting used to people picking on your size means you're accustomed to being that size so there is no need for change. I would still be extremely obese right now if it wasn't for a school trip to Paris in 2005. I like French food and had a lot of it. But on the trip I got food poisoning and lost 7 pounds. Those 7 pounds were the spark that started the fire. I realized that sometimes you have to RSVP yes when life sends you an invitation for change. At first I thought: ""Cool, I lost 7 pounds. I will try not to regain that weight."" Then I remembered there was something called exercise, and that experts said it could help you lose weight. So I started using my mother's elliptical machine. I worked out for 15 to 20 minutes every single day. I also tried to eat half of what I had eaten before. Instead of four potatoes I ate two; instead of drinking a whole bottle of milk, I would only drink half of it. My body responded well: Within two years I had lost 99 pounds. (If I had known I would eventually be writing a weight loss story for CNN, I would have gone for 100). I realized that if you and your body are hungry for change, weight loss can be fun, instead of a burden. Luckily, I've never encountered the dreaded yo-yo effect. I have maintained my slimmer figure for seven years now. I never stopped exercising. After you've come so far, you don't want to take a risk and regain the weight because of laziness. I purposefully gained 22 pounds working out in the gym because I wanted to build muscle. Now my 6-foot 4-inch frame weighs 187 pounds. My body mass index is 22. There are countless books on how to lose weight. All the authors seem to have priceless pieces of advice they've skillfully converted into cash. But in the end, I believe losing weight is a simple trade: . You feed your body the right amount of food and exercise. In return, your body burns fat. Even your wallet gets a little lighter because you have to buy new clothes. After seven years of medical education, I have learned a lot about the health dangers of being overweight. I'm glad I took life's invitation to change as a teen. As a doctor who has been where they are, I hope to help others who are struggling with their weight do the same.","Felix Gussone started his weight loss journey after getting food poisoning in Paris .

After going in front thanks to a Xabi Alonso penalty, Spain fell apart after Van Persie's equalizer, going on to lose 5-1. It meant Spain conceded more in its opening 90 minutes in Brazil than in its last 10 games at World Cups and European Championships combined.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- People living downwind of the Port of Los Angeles were warned to stay indoors because of potentially toxic smoke from a wharf fire Tuesday morning. A hundred firefighters, using boats, trucks, helicopters and scuba gear, extinguished the blaze Monday night, but the Los Angeles Police Department issued a smoke hazard alert early Tuesday. ""If you are in the Port of Los Angeles area, please shelter in place,"" the alert said. ""This means stay indoors. Â Bring your pets inside if possible. Close your doors and windows. Turn off air conditioning."" The four-alarm fire burned about 150 feet of a wooden dock that stretched under a warehouse and threatened nearby cargo ships, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Katherine Main said. The warehouse did not catch fire, but heavy timbers under it burned, she said. The Port of Los Angeles, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, is the busiest container port in the United States and ranks 16th in the world, according to the American Association of Port Authorities.

"(CNN) -- Besides charting the nature of space and time and penning the bestseller ""A Brief History of Time,"" Stephen Hawking has another distinction: He beat the life-expectancy odds for people with ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Stephen Hawking, shown in Pasadena, California, in March, is hospitalized but said to be ""comfortable."" Most people with ALS survive only two to five years after diagnosis. Hawking, on the other hand, has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in America and motor neuron disease, or MND, in the United Kingdom. Hawking, 67, was taken to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, England, on Monday in a ""very ill"" condition, and spent the night in the hospital. He was said to be  ""comfortable""  Tuesday. Bob Hawkins, 75, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who learned of his ALS diagnosis last year, said Hawking, with his long life and ability to communicate through a voice synthesizer, gives him hope. The physicist should be a role model for people with the disease as well as those without it, Hawkins said. ""The man is brilliant, and he has striven through a lot of adversity to accomplish all of the things he has accomplished,"" Hawkins said. ""He should be an inspiration for anyone."" The British physicist also embodies the idea of empowering people with ALS to live life to the fullest, said Dr. Lucie Bruijn, scientific director for the ALS Association, in an e-mail. This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association, she said. ""To have achieved so much in his lifetime while battling Lou Gehrig's Disease is quite remarkable,"" she said. ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, which results in muscle weakness and atrophy. The disease causes the death of motor neurons, meaning the brain loses its ability to control muscle movement. Hawking has had direct involvement in promoting awareness and research into his disease. He recently agreed to be a patron of the MND Association in Northampton, England, meaning he will lend his name to the charity and support it by attending events, fundraising, or other activities. He has participated in some of the organization's high-profile events, said Mel Barry, communications manager at the MND Association. ""He's a very busy man, so it's wonderful that he's publicly supporting us with his very heavy workload,"" she said. Hawking's case is also unusual because his condition was diagnosed at a young age, said Sharon Matland, vice president of patient services at the ALS Association. People typically are between 40 and 70 when they learn they have ALS; Hawking found out at age 21. Some very rare cases manifest in the late teens, Bruijn said. There have been other rare cases of people living long lives with ALS, although none as famous as Hawking. Barry said she knows of a man in Ireland who has lived with the disease for 30 years -- but only about 5 percent of people with ALS live longer than 10 years. ALS affects 350,000 people worldwide and up to 30,000 people in the United States, the ALS Association estimates. ""It totally upsets your entire way of living,"" Hawkins of North Carolina said. ""It slowly takes over your entire muscle structure and eventually your limbs are affected, your speech may or may not be affected. The only part of your body that isn't affected is your mind."" Still, patients experience different symptoms, and some do have cognitive impairment, Matland said. They may have trouble making day-to-day decisions, such as choosing which bills to pay first. Hawkins said he first experienced weakness in his legs and arms, typical symptoms of the disease. People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet, Matland said. ""You drop things or you can't grasp things as you might have been able to do in the past,"" she said. Loss of voice is another potential symptom, but some people are able to speak until they die, Barry said. The nature of the disease is that it's very different in each person, she said. Most people with ALS become dependent on a wheelchair -- sometimes within six to eight months, but the time frame varies, Matland said. Typically, the ultimate cause of death is respiratory failure, because ALS affects the muscles used for breathing, she said. David Niven, the English actor known for his roles in ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""The Pink Panther,"" died of ALS at age 73. He suffered from the disease for more than a year. A variety of ongoing clinical trials seek to find an effective treatment for ALS in the U.S. Drugs in these trials include lithium, ceftriaxone, and memantine, according to the ALS Association. A recent study showed there may be a genetic component to the disease. In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said. Psychiatrists currently prescribe lithium, a mood-stabilizing drug, for bipolar disorder and other conditions. An FDA-approved drug called riluzole has been shown to prolong survival for some ALS patients, but extends the life span by only three to six months, Barry said. Typically, palliative care is the main treatment -- managing symptoms rather than stopping or curing them. Stem cell therapy may hold promise for the disease, but the general perception is that research into it is not sufficiently advanced, according to the MND Association. To raise money for research in the U.S., the ALS Association hosts walks across the country. Hawkins said he will be participating in the 2009 Fayetteville, North Carolina, Walk to Defeat ALS in May. ""I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is, and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects,"" he said. CNN's Jennifer Pifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Stephen Hawking is a rare case of someone who has survived decades with ALS .

"(CNN) -- A Tuesday hearing was canceled in a battle between the New England Patriots and accused killer Aaron Hernandez over the former tight end's demand for his team records, including medical and psychological tests as well as his scouting report. Defense attorney Michael Fee told the court ""the matter is resolved,"" without elaborating. Efforts to reach both Hernandez' attorneys were unsuccessful, and a Patriots' spokesman declined to comment. The defense had rejected an offer to receive what the Patriots called most of his records. The three-time Super Bowl champion team had flatly refused to turn over a scouting report citing ""trade secrets"" and said the team only had a summary of the psychological report done at the 2010 NFL Combine. The Patriots told the defense to go the people who administer the test for full results. A source close to the investigation told CNN that the defense likely will get what it wanted. Prosecutors said it is a defense matter and gave no further comment. The Patriots cut Hernandez on June 26, 2013, the same day he was arrested in the slaying of Odin Lloyd, who once dated a sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in that case and in another to the slayings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in 2012. Legal experts said the defense's attempt to look at Hernandez's team records may indicate an interest in pursuing a diminished capacity defense. Earlier this month, Fee argued the tests would be relevant to their case. ""Any record bearing on a defendant's psychological function, illnesses or afflictions, addiction, cognitive ability, social interactions, behavior under stress, relationship with authority and other such factors are undeniably relevant to the defense of an individual charged with first degree murder,"" Fee wrote in a motion to a Massachusetts superior court judge.

"(CNN) -- The Israeli military has suspended a soldier who was filmed by CNN firing a rifle at Palestinian demonstrators during a deadly shooting incident on May 15 that resulted in the deaths of two Palestinian teenagers, an Israeli military source told CNN. The source, who asked not to be identified because of a continuing Israeli investigation, said the soldier that was suspended worked for the military's communications department and was not supposed to be shooting at all. ""He's not supposed to shoot things,"" the military source told CNN. ""And that's ultimately what he was doing,"" the source said. ""That's why he was suspended until the investigation has been completed."" The Israeli Defense Force is standing by its assertion that Israeli border police and soldiers only fired tear gas and rubber-coated projectiles during deadly clashes in the West Bank village of Beitunya on May 15. Security cameras caught the fatal shooting that day of two Palestinian teenagers in Beitunya. According to six hours of raw, unedited video distributed by the children's rights advocacy organization Defense of Children International and reviewed by CNN in its entirety, the two boys -- ages 17 and 16 -- were shot on the same patch of asphalt on the same day, the second victim 73 minutes after the first. At the exact moment when the first boy, Nadeem Nouwarah, was fatally wounded, CNN producer Kareem Khadder was also filming the clashes. In the CNN video, it is not clear what kind of rounds the Israelis were shooting, or whether their gunfire hit Nouwarah. However, Khadder's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots, Palestinians were already racing to put the fatally wounded Nouwarah in the ambulance. CNN filmed two Israeli security officers firing at the time of the incident. The first wore the black uniform and visored-helmet of a border police officer. The second wore the green uniform of the Israeli Defense Force, and appears to be the same man who was filmed earlier taking photographs with a still camera. Seconds after he shoots his weapon, a border policeman takes the rifle from him. CNN was able to match events on the security video with events on CNN's own video. The IDF soldier is seen at other moments in the video aiming the rifle at the Palestinian protesters, appearing to be coached by a border police officer. IDF spokesmen and military experts tell CNN that both of the weapons fired in the video appear to be outfitted with an attachment used to shoot rubber-coated, metal projectiles. These ""rubber bullets"" are designed to wound, but not penetrate the bodies of the targets. According to a medical report, Nouwarah was pronounced dead in a hospital, having suffered a single bullet wound that entered chest and passed out his back. Doctors pronounced the other teenage victim, Mohammad Odeh Salameh, dead on arrival at the hospital, with a bullet wound that had pierced his back and exited out of his chest. During an interview last week, Nouwarah's grieving father Siam showed CNN the bloody backpack that his son was filmed wearing at the moment he was shot. There was a small hole in the bag, at roughly the same location where the bullet would have exited from Nouwarah's body. The elder Nouwarah then pulled a packet of bloodstained papers out of the bag. They were photocopies of a text book that included the writings of Anton Chekhov, accompanied by handwriting, doodles, and class notes. ""We were surprised when we took the school backpack back from the hospital to find this bullet inside,"" said the elder Nouwarah, who then pulled out a small used bullet stored in a plastic bag out of the backpack. The metal slug appeared to be from a 556 NATO round, the standard ammunition used by M-16 rifles carried by Israeli security forces. It was impossible for CNN to confirm the authenticity of the bullet. Siam Nouwarah said he was saving it for a forensic examination. He accuses Israeli soldiers of killing his son. The Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, which investigates allegations of human rights abuses in the West Bank, said the fatal shootings in Beitunya could not have been caused by rubber bullets. ""We still think that these injuries could not have been sustained with any other weapons other than live ammunition,"" said Sarit Michaeli, a B'Tselem spokeswoman. Though rubber bullets are sometimes known to be fatal, Michaeli said ""there's just no recorded incident ever of a rubber bullet killing two people from a range of about 70 meters,"" referring to an estimate of the distance between the border police and the victims. However, Michaeli added that the CNN footage shows ""border police firing something that looks very much like a rubber bullet."" The U.S. State Department has joined the United Nations in calling for a swift and impartial investigation into the shootings. Father blames Israeli military in Palestinian teens' deaths .

"(CNN) -- This Pachyrhinosaurus can go to the head of its class. It's not often, after all, that you can see and touch a skull that's about the size of a Smart Car, about 70 million years old and looks like a mutant blend of a triceratops and giant parrot. University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky first made the mammoth find in Alberta's Badlands, then revealed it to the world Thursday. ""It almost looks like some sort of mythical beast,"" Zelenitsky said. ""Because it is so big and (mature), it makes for a very strange-looking individual."" This isn't the first Pachyrhinosaurus discovery -- that came in the mid-20th century -- and there have been other notable such finds since then in Canada's Alberta province and Alaska. But what makes this one unique is how well preserved the skull is (75% to 80% complete, which is remarkable for a dinosaur), the fact it's from an older Pachyrhinosaurus (therefore more can be learned from it than a younger version), and, of course, its immense size. Not that Zelenitsky's team knew all that when they spotted a bumpy rock in mid-October while exploring exposed southern Alberta's Drumheller -- a town that calls itself the Dinosaur Capital of the World for a reason, given the outcrops that make it a paleontologists' dream. A little digging led to more digging and, after about three days, the realization that they'd found a gigantic dinosaur skull. It took several more months (and the removal of 5 tons of rock) to unearth it in three pieces and show it off to the world. Still, a lot of work needs to be done to peel away remaining surrounding rock and examine the skull in more detail, not to mention see it in full. ""It was really exciting because, when we started, there really wasn't much there,"" Zelenitsky, an associate professor in the University of Calgary's geoscience department, said. ""Then, the skull was not really ending it was so big."" Even with more to peel back, Zelenitsky already calls this skull one of the biggest, if not the biggest, of any Pachyrhinosaurus ever discovered. Given its distinct nature, she and fellow paleontologists will be trying to determine if it is part of its own species or just a big version of an existing one. (There are three known species of Pachyrhinosaurus as is.) Even if it's part of previously discovered Pachyrhinosaurus species, there's no doubt this skull is quite a sight. The herbivore's beak at the front of its snout was likely used to crop vegetation. Behind that are rows of teeth that finished off whatever greens made it into the mouth. Then there's what Zelenitsky describes as a ""huge, almost platter-shape structure"" and the dinosaur's frill. Instead of pointed horns like a triceratops, Pachyrhinosaurs have masses of bones atop their heads likely used in head-butting rituals to compete for mates or perhaps for combat. The entire skull is about 2 to 2.5 meters (6.5 to 8 feet) long; the entire animal is only 6 meters, meaning this Pachyrhinosaur (as well as its kin) was very top heavy. ""These animals had huge skulls relative to their bodies,"" said Zelenitsky.","A University of Calgary paleontologist shows off a Pachyrhinosaurus skull .
It's one of the biggest, if not the biggest, of its kind at 2 to 2.5 meters, she says .
The discovery is also remarkably intact, though there's still more to reveal .

"(EW.com ) -- ""Hercules's"" muscles were no match for ""Lucy's"" drug-enhanced brain at the box office this weekend. Audiences turned out in earnest to see the Scarlett Johansson thriller, which earned an expectation-shattering $44 million from 3,173 theaters in its first weekend. Not only is it director Luc Besson's biggest opening, ""Lucy"" is also a career high for Scarlett Johansson as a lead. Audiences for the original feature were evenly split between genders, 35 percent were under the age of 25, and 29 percent were Hispanic. But even though the EuropaCorp-produced, Universal-distributed project appealed to a wide demographic swath, those who did see the R-rated action film were a little less kind in the exit polls, slapping ""Lucy"" with a poor C+ Cinema Score. ""Hercules"" (B+ Cinema Score), starring Dwayne Johnson, took the second place spot with an estimated $29 million from 3,595 locations in its first weekend in theaters. Audiences were 58 percent male and 36 percent under the age of 25. The Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie cost a reported $100 million to produce, so, although this domestic debut isn't ideal, it did still manage to beat the modest analyst expectations. Besides, international is what really matters for the Brett Ratner-directed sword-and-sandals feature, which took in $28.7 million from 25 territories and 3,264 locations. It took the No. 1 spot in Russia ($12 million), Australia ($3.5 million), Malaysia ($1.6 million), the Philippines ($1.2 million), and Taiwan ($1.2 million), to name a few. Next weekend it opens in Finland, India, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Serbia, and Slovenia. The rest of the top five were holdovers this weekend, which is down 13 percent from last year when ""The Wolverine"" opened to $53 million. After two weeks at No. 1, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" dropped 55 percent and earned an estimated $16.4 million in its third weekend in theaters. Meanwhile ""The Purge: Anarchy"" fell 67 percent in weekend two with $9.9 million across the three-day. Compared to other films, that might seem like a disaster, but it's expected for horror offerings, which are reliably front-loaded. The first had an even steeper 75.6-percent drop last year. Finally, ""Planes: Fire & Rescue"" continues to fly in competition-free skies and took in an estimated $9.3 million in its second weekend in theaters. Here's the top five: . 1. Lucy — $44 million (new) 2. Hercules—$29 million (new) 3. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes—$16.4 million ($172.1 million domestic total) 4. The Purge: Anarchy — $9.9 million ($51.3 million domestic total) 5. Planes: Fire & Rescue -- $9.3 million ($35.1 million domestic total) Clarius Entertainment's ""And So It Goes"" (B+ Cinema Score), starring Diane Keaton and Michael Douglas failed to break the top five, earning an estimated $4.55 million from 1,762 locations. In the specialty box-office world, ""A Most Wanted Man"" managed to snag 10th place with an estimated $2.72 million, even though it only played on 361 screens. Roadside Attractions released the R-rated, John le Carré adaptation which stars Philip Seymour Hoffman (in one of his last big-screen roles), Rachel McAdams, and Willem Dafoe. The comedy concert film ""The Fluffy Movie"" picked up $1.3 million from 432 locations, and Woody Allen's Emma Stone/Colin Firth vehicle ""Magic in the Moonlight"" debuted in 17 locations to $426,000.

"(CNN) -- Four days before Baylor University basketball star Isaiah Austin hoped to be drafted into the NBA, his dreams of playing in the pros were extinguished by a rare genetic disease called Marfan syndrome. ""I had a dream that my name was going to be called,"" Austin told ESPN. But after a standard physical, test results revealed he had Marfan syndrome. ""They said I wouldn't be able to play basketball no more, at a competitive level. ... They told me my arteries and my heart are enlarged, and that if I overwork myself or push myself, my heart could rupture."" Marfan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation that leaves connective tissue in the body weak, according to the National Institutes of Health. The defective gene can also cause excessive growth of longer bones in the body, although it's not clear why this happens. People with Marfan syndrome are usually very tall and thin. They often have longer than usual arms, legs, fingers and toes, according to the NIH. Austin, at 7-foot-1, matches this description. The center from Arlington, Texas, revealed during his sophomore season at Baylor that he is blind in his right eye as a result of a detached retina he suffered as a teenager. He was expected to be the first partially blind player in the NBA. Eye problems are a common effect of Marfan syndrome. Curved spines, chests that stick out or sink in, flexible joints, and stretch marks not related to weight gain or loss are also visible signs of Marfan syndrome. Less visible, and often unnoticed until it's too late: weak parts of the aorta -- the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body -- which can tear or rupture. Leaky heart valves that can cause a heart murmur are also among the symptoms. As devastating as the news may be for Austin, getting this diagnosis now may be a lifesaver. ""People with Marfan syndrome can live a long life if they are diagnosed and treated with medication and, when necessary, surgery,"" Carolyn Levering, president and CEO of The Marfan Foundation, said in a statement. ""Competitive and contact sports need to be halted to protect the fragile aorta. Otherwise, it is prone to tear and possibly rupture, which would cause sudden death."" ""While it is disappointing for Isaiah that he cannot pursue a career in the NBA, receiving the diagnosis before a fatal episode is truly a gift."" Nearly 30 years ago, American volleyball player Flo Hyman was playing in a Japanese league. After being taken out of a game for a routine substitution, Sports Illustrated reported in 1986, she sat on the bench, slid to the floor and died. Her diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was made only after her family requested an autopsy. Hyman never knew she was playing with a dime-sized weak spot on her aorta that burst during the game. The Marfan Foundation estimates about 200,000 people in the United States have Marfan syndrome or a related disorder; about half don't know it. Most people who have Marfan syndrome inherit it from their parents, according to the NIH, though a quarter of the cases are not inherited. There is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but getting regular checkups, having surgery, taking medications and wearing a medical alert bracelet can help someone living with the disease have the best possible outcome.","NBA hopeful Isaiah Austin diagnosed with Marfan syndrome .

"(CNN) -- World champion Marc Marquez continued his impeccable start to the 2014 season with his third win in three races with victory in the Argentina MotoGP Sunday. The Honda rider also became the first rider since the great Italian star Giacomo Agostini in 1971 to win the first three from pole position. The 21-year-old Spaniard's teammate Dani Pedrosa finished second ahead of the Yamaha duo of Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi in third and fourth respectively. Marquez, so dominant in Doha and Texas, did not have things all his own way after opting for a hard front tire choice and following a sluggish start was as low as seventh on the second lap. But as his tires bedded in on the Autodromo Termas de Rio Hondo, a circuit being used for the first time for a MotoGP, he powered through the field. He was in second place by lap four and then overtook the Yamaha of former champion Jorge Lorenzo after tracking him for a dozen laps. Marquez soon pulled well clear and Pedrosa also overhauled Lorenzo with a lap to go of the 25, to complete a one-two for the Repsol Honda line-up. Marquez has a perfect 75 points after three rounds, with Pedrosa on 56 and Rossi in third on 41 points. ""The beginning was difficult. My tires were not good and I span as I was on the dirty side of the track,"" admitted the world champion. ""But it was fun. Jorge opened the gap and I just kept pushing to catch him at the end."" Stefan Bradl and Andrea Iannone finished fifth and sixth, with promising young Briton Bradley Smith in seventh in his debut season at the highest level. In the Moto2 competition, championship leader Esteve Rabat of Spain scored his second win of the season while Italy's Romano Fenati won the Moto3 race to deny Australian Jack Miller his hat-trick of wins in that class. MotoGP was returning to Argentina for the first time since 1999 as the third of 18 rounds this season.","Marc Marquez claims hat-trick of wins at start of MotoGP season .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamist militants gained ground in one Malian town on Monday even as government troops stepped up their offensive to wrest control from rebels. Militants have taken control of the central town of Diabaly, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV. Word of the rebel advance on Monday came as the U.N. Security Council met to discuss the conflict in Mali, where Islamist rebels have been seizing territory for months. World leaders from a number of countries have said they'll send troops or provide logistical support for the fight against Islamist militants in the West African nation. France took the international lead in assisting Mali over the weekend, with military airstrikes targeting rebel training camps and other targets. Officials said France's intervention last week was necessary to stop a rebel takeover of the capital, Bamako. ""Our assessment was that they (the rebels) were actually able to take Bamako. So we decided that what was at stake was the existence of the state of Mali, and beyond Mali was the stability of all west Africa,"" said Gerard Araud, French ambassador to the United Nations. ""We had no other choice to launch this military intervention."" Read more: France aims to 'eradicate' terrorism in Mali . The United States has promised to help the French effort, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday. That assistance could include logistical and intelligence support. ""I commend France for taking the steps that it has. And what we have promised them is that we will work with them to cooperate with them and to provide whatever assistance we can to try to help them in that effort,"" Panetta told reporters on his plane en route to Portugal. The United States has already started sharing intelligence from satellites and intercepted signals with the French, defense officials said on Monday. In addition, the Pentagon is considering sending refueling tankers so that French jets can fly longer, more sustained combat missions, according to the officials. Drones ""are under consideration,"" the defense officials said, though the military's stash of unmanned aerial vehicles is in heavy demand. Both stressed that these would be surveillance drones and said there are no plans yet to deploy them. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, meanwhile, said the United States is reviewing a number of requests from the French, but that no decisions have been made. The United States, she said, is ""not in the position to support the Malian military directly until we have democratic processes restored by way of an election in Mali."" It was unclear Monday when France's role in the military offensive would end, and whether there could be consequences beyond Mali's borders. ""There are risks in France and in other countries as well,"" Le Drian told BFM. ""We are extremely vigilant in that regard."" Malian Foreign Minister Tieman Hubert Coulibaly said Monday that it was unclear how long clashes with Islamist militants would last. ""Clearly, for us it's not just about making them retreat,"" he told BFM. ""It is necessary to chase them out."" Coulibaly said his country was grateful for France's assistance, which it ""urgently requested."" And Mali may call on other countries such as the United States for military aid, he said. ""It is a problem which is currently in Mali, but which concerns the whole civilized world. And those who are in action against Mali could attack the rest of the world,"" he told BFM. ""It is a cancer which could have spread if we had not intervened, of course, with the precious aid of France."" Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali . France has several hundred ground troops in Mali, and nearby West African nations have pledged to send hundreds of troops to join in the fight. Nigeria, which already has a technical team on the ground in Mali, expects to have troops in the country by next week, a presidential spokesman told CNN. He declined to say how many soldiers would be deployed. Officials from the United Kingdom and Germany have said they're considering offering logistical support to the Malian government as it fights insurgents controlling the north. As French fighter jets bombed rebel strongholds over the weekend, both sides of the fight said they were determined to win. ""France's goal is to lead a relentless struggle against terrorist groups, preventing any new offensive of these groups to the south of Mali,"" France's Defense Ministry said in a statement. Islamist rebels in Mali acknowledged Sunday they suffered heavy losses in fights with the country's military and French troops, but they said it wouldn't stop them. ""The war has only started,"" said Sanda Ould Boumama, a spokesman for the al Qaeda-linked rebel group Ansar Dine. ""We expect more casualties."" He accused the French military of attacking Malians. ""Now the world can see that it's the French who are the real terrorists,"" he said. French and Malian military officials say the assaults are against rebel strongholds, not civilians. Read more: Who is Ansar Dine? On Monday, Amnesty International called on all sides in the conflict to protect civilians. The rights groups also urged the international community to support the deployment of human rights monitors. ""There are real concerns that the fighting might lead to indiscriminate or other unlawful attacks in areas where members of armed Islamist groups and civilians are intermingled,"" Paule Rigaud, Amnesty International's deputy director for Africa, said in a statement. ""The international community has a responsibility to prevent a fresh surge in abuses during this new phase of the conflict. Forces involved in armed attacks should avoid indiscriminate shelling at all costs, and do their utmost to prevent civilian casualties,"" he added. A French colony until 1960, Mali had military rulers for decades until its first democratic elections in 1992. It remained stable politically until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate support for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels in the country's largely desert north. Tuareg rebels, who'd sought independence for decades, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who wound up in control of a large area as the Tuaregs retreated. The United Nations says amputations, floggings and public executions -- like the July stoning of a couple who had reportedly had an affair -- became common in areas controlled by radical Islamists. They applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law in banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and damaged Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines. A recent video posted online purports to show Islamic extremists from the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa cutting off the hand of a thief and flogging another man, accused of having sexual relations with a girl with ""mental deficiencies."" In the video, the supposed crimes of the men are read aloud before the punishments are carried out. A small crowd, including children, cheer. Already, the armed groups' activity and a pervasive drought have displaced hundreds of thousands of Malians. And the Islamists' movement southward has raised concerns among leaders in West Africa and elsewhere, some of them calling for swift and decisive military intervention in support of Mali's government, based in Bamako. The U.N. Security Council last month authorized a one-year military peacekeeping mission in the country. Members of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, pledged thousands of troops, and the Security Council has urged other nations to contribute forces as well. The Security Council met Monday to receive an update on Mali. Following that meeting, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, said there may be a need for a new Security Council resolution. The United Nations said preparations are under way for a U.N. multidisciplinary team to go to Bamako soon. Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo, Senegal and Benin are among the countries that have pledged to send troops, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters Monday. Mali's northern neighbor, Algeria, will close its border with Mali, Algeria's state news agency, Algeria Press Service reported. A spokesman for Germany's Foreign Ministry said the country's leaders were considering offering medical, logistical and humanitarian aid to Mali. Two British military transport aircraft have been assigned to help with the French troop deployment, but no British forces will be in a combat role, said Mark Simmonds, minister for Africa for the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""The ferocity and fanaticism of the extremists in northern Mali must be not be allowed to sweep unchecked into the country's capital,"" Simmonds told British lawmakers Monday. ""France, which has an historic relationship with Mali, is quite rightly in the lead. In the coming days, we will be focused on the regional and international diplomacy we must achieve to check this emerging threat."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Dana Ford, Chris Lawrence, Dheepthi Namasivayam, Vladimir Duthiers, Saskya Vandoorne and Fred Pleitgen contributed to this report.","NEW: Defense officials: U.S. has already started sharing intelligence with the French .

"(CNN) -- A 79-year-old Florida woman backed over seven pedestrians Sunday morning while backing out of a handicapped space in a church parking lot, killing three people, police say. Doreen Landstra was backing out of a space in the parking lot of a 55-and-older mobile home community in East Bradenton when she lost control of her SUV, striking the pedestrians and crashing over a curb before coming to rest partially submerged in a creek. Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Gregory Bueno tells CNN charges are pending as the investigation continues. Landstra, a former choir director in the Bradenton community, according to CNN affiliate Bay News 9, was leaving church when, according to witnesses, she appeared to think she put her Chevrolet SUV in drive but instead shifted into reverse. According to Bueno, three Bradenton residents -- Johanna Dijkhoff, 80, Wilhemina Paul, 70 and Margaret Vanderlaan, 72 -- died as a result of their injuries. Four others sustained serious injuries and were taken to an area hospital. One has since been released, Bueno said. Witness Jan Verstveg told Bay News 9 that he watched Landstra reverse into the crowd. Landstra told witnesses ""somehow the pedal got stuck"" and that ""it was all a terrible accident,"" Verstveg recalled. Some witnesses told Bay News 9 they ""heard screams."" Landstra's 87-year-old husband was in the car with her. Neither sustained injuries. Landstra was interviewed by investigators at the scene and then left with her family, according to Bay News 9. Bueno declined to provide CNN with details regarding Landstra's condition at the time of the crash and was unable to speculate on possible charges she may face.

"(CNN) -- The Republican Party's support for same-sex marriage is starting to grow. In the past 16 months, the number of GOP legislators supporting equal access to civil marriage quadrupled -- from just two to eight. And recently, Republican Rep. David Jolly of Florida, a swing-district legislator with a deep personal and religious belief in traditional marriage, made a case we will hear more -- a good society should confer the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage on same-sex couples while respecting the religious freedom of houses of worship to perform the sacrament of marriage only in the ways they see fit. ""As a matter of my Christian faith, I believe in traditional marriage. But as a matter of constitutional principle I believe in a form of limited government that protects personal liberty. To me, that means that the sanctity of one's marriage should be defined by their faith and by their church, not by their state. ""Accordingly, I believe it is fully appropriate for a state to recognize both traditional marriage as well as same-sex marriage, and therefore I support the recent decision by a Monroe County Circuit judge."" That July 17 decision applies only to Monroe County, Florida, home to Key West. Florida's attorney general is appealing the ruling. Jolly's view is consistent with core Republican values of limited government, individual liberty, personal responsibility and stronger families. More conservatives are starting to understand that the sanctity of a couple's marriage should be determined by their faith and that the legality of their marriage should be determined by law -- equally applied to all. This means that government should respect the right of churches to perform only blessings in which they believe, and it should respect the inherent right of citizens to marry the person they love, without using tax dollars to deny them that basic freedom. Amen to that. The foundation of the Republican Party respects personal freedom without unnecessary government intrusion. So why should marriage be any different? The GOP's stance is changing beyond the halls of Congress. Republican governors with traditional perspectives on marriage are finding principled, inclusive positions. Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania and Brian Sandoval of Nevada have not changed their personal views of marriage, but they have responsibly refused to pursue costly and certain-to-lose litigation over the issue, choosing instead to focus on bread-and-butter issues. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has opposed same-sex marriage, said recently that his own views don't matter and that courts will resolve the issue. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has allowed her state to move on as well, opting not to amend her state constitution in what would be a misguided attempt to prevent same-sex couples from experiencing the joys and challenges of marriage. Attitudes toward employment discrimination against gays are also changing. In addition to Christie and Walker's public stands against discrimination, GOP Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan said he was open to talks on the issue and Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona has suggested that state law could be updated to ensure American workers are judged on their qualifications, hard work and merit -- and not on their sexual orientation. These principled statements are not simply a defense mechanism to win votes in upcoming elections. They reflect a heartfelt acknowledgment that every citizen should be treated fairly and equally under the law and that gay and lesbian Americans are just as American as the rest of us. Appeals court rejects Virginia same-sex marriage ban . The battle within the GOP for gay rights is not yet won. There are outliers like Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has likely done permanent damage to his presidential aspirations by suggesting being gay and or lesbian is like being an alcoholic -- you can choose not to do it. These comments are harmful to gay and lesbian people and fly in the face of what straight people innately know about the immutability of sexual orientation. Even worse, Perry's comments repel swing voters from considering worthy Republican policy solutions for fear that the GOP cares more about pursuing a narrow social agenda that threatens the freedom of their family and friends. The tide is turning in favor of freedom across the country. And that means a more accepting and inclusive message is emerging. The GOP is ready for change, and it's ready to welcome people with sincerely held beliefs on both sides of the marriage issue -- both in terms of party membership and in terms of primary politics. Across the country, Republican candidates are being judged on their substance and ability to advocate for economic freedom, and not because of their positions on marriage. An impressive number of Republican state legislators, 233, have stood up for the freedom to marry, and only three have lost their seats because of that stand. That reflects a party and a country that's ready bury the politics of LGBT freedom in the graveyard of defunct wedge issues. The bottom line is that even if your personal religious views do not align with same-sex marriage, someone else's do. And that's OK. We should be able to disagree, treat each other with respect and live our lives with freedom and equal opportunity under the law. Republican leaders are beginning to ""get it"" and that's good for an America that belongs to all of us.","Margaret Hoover: More GOP legislators are starting to support civil same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi's lone abortion clinic can stay open, after a federal appeals court Tuesday ruled against a law that effectively would have shut it down -- contending that it's not right to simply pass the buck to other states. Tuesday's decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals spares the Jackson Women's Health Organization, at least for now. The law's sponsor, state Rep. Sam Mims, said Tuesday that ""all the parties involved are looking"" at what to do next -- including a possible appeal that could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. It all stems from House Bill 1390, legislation signed into law in 2012 that requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Three doctors work in the clinic in the Mississippi capital, only one of whom meets this requirement. Seven hospitals in and around Jackson rebuffed the other two doctors' requests to get the same privileges -- not because of their qualifications, per se, but because their ""medical practice is inconsistent with"" the hospitals' practices. State's clinic faced threat of shutdown . As the appeals court noted Tuesday, this isn't a matter of whether abortion is legal: The Supreme Court ""long ago"" established that it is. ""The ultimate issue in this appeal is whether the state of Mississippi can impose a regulation that effectively will close its only abortion clinic,"" the judges wrote in the prevailing opinion. The state had ceded this fact, contending that Mississippi residents still could get an abortion in Tennessee, Louisiana, Alabama or elsewhere. But that didn't satisfy the appeals court. ""We ... hold that Mississippi may not shift its obligation to respect the established constitutional rights of its citizens to another state,"" the judges wrote. ""Such a proposal would not only place an undue burden on the exercise of a constitutional right, but would also disregard a state's obligation under the principle of federalism -- applicable to all 50 states."" In a post on its Facebook page, the Jackson Women's Health Organization cheered the decision and thanked its supporters. Mims expressed disappointment. ""This legislation has always been about the best possible health care for women who receive an abortion,"" he told CNN. ""I still believe that having physicians obtain privileges in a local hospital makes sense."" Mims noted that other states have similar requirements. One of them is Texas, which had its own regulation held up -- ironically, by the same federal appeals court that ruled on the Mississippi matter. Appeals court upholds parts of Texas abortion law . That decision found that making some women travel less than 150 miles, because of the regulations within the Texas law, ""is not an undue burden."" But forcing them to cross state lines -- and allowing some states not to offer abortions while others do -- is a different matter. The judges on Tuesday referred to a 1938 Supreme Court decision involving an African-American being denied admission to the University of Missouri's law school because of his race. The university system offered him, instead, a tuition stipend to go to a law school in another state. A common tie between that case and what's happening with regarding to the Mississippi abortion clinic is that ""a state cannot lean on its sovereign neighbors to provide protection of its citizens' federal constitutional rights,"" the judges said. Nancy Northup, head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, applauded Tuesday's appeals court ruling on Mississippi while acknowledging its future is still uncertain. ""For far too long, women in Mississippi have been teetering on the precipice of a reality similar to the dark days before Roe v. Wade,"" Northup said in a news release. ""This is unacceptable, unconstitutional and contrary to the consensus of the strong majority of Americans who do not wish to see Roe's constitutional protections overturned."" Mims thinks that House Bill 1390 should still stand, contending that it includes a sensible measure to safeguard women's health. ""I think it's a very important piece of legislation that passed the Mississippi Legislature,"" the Republican from McComb said. ""And we'll have to see what happens next.""

"(CNN) -- The tea party movement is an important step closer to doing something it's done only three times before: Oust an incumbent Republican senator in a GOP primary. Tea party backed state Sen. Chris McDaniel forced incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran into a runoff in Mississippi's Republican primary. The challenge could give the 5-year-old grass-roots conservative movement - which so far this year has suffered a string of high profile primary defeats - a much needed injection of energy. In Tuesday's other marquee showdown, a candidate who enjoyed both tea party and mainstream Republican backing won big in the Iowa GOP Senate primary, thanks in part to some clever ads that went viral. And in California, which now uses an open primary system where the top two finishers advance to the November election regardless of party affiliation, a moderate Republican edged out a tea party-backed conservative for the honor of facing off in the midterms against heavily favored Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. Here are the top takeaways from Tuesday's primaries: . 1. Round 2: Tea party vs. establishment in Mississippi: While candidates with tea party support have struggled to claim major victories this year, McDaniel's ability to force Cochran, 76, into a runoff indicates the grass-roots conservative movement is still rumbling -- and powerful enough to nearly take out a six-term incumbent senator. Since the tea party started gaining steam in 2009, the far right has defeated only three incumbent senators in GOP primaries: Bob Bennett of Utah (2010), Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (2010) and Dick Lugar of Indiana (2012). Murkowski, however, later won the general race with a write-in campaign. McDaniel, 42, and his supporters say Cochran, who's running for a seventh term, has been in Washington far too long. He especially irked grassroots conservatives when he said earlier this year, ""the tea party is something I don't really know a lot about."" But it's unclear who has more momentum going forward. McDaniel certainly rallied his supporters Tuesday night, vowing to claim victory in the June 24 runoff. ""I promise you this, whether it's tomorrow or whether it's three weeks from tonight, we will stand victorious in this race,"" he said. But Cochran supporters also say they're ready for another round. Henry Barbour, who runs the pro-Cochran PAC Mississippi Conservatives, told CNN's Dana Bash that they're ""going to get up and rethink"" their message. ""Really organize from the ground up,"" he added. Barbour said ""complacency"" among Cochran voters ""hurt us,"" and he thinks ""they got outshouted."" Stuart Stevens, a Cochran adviser and former adviser to Mitt Romney, told Bash that three weeks allows more time to scrutinize McDaniel's record and ask tough questions. But supporters of McDaniel may point to the 2012 Senate primary in Texas, where a political newcomer known as Ted Cruz came from behind to push the establishment candidate, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, into a runoff. The extra time gave Cruz a longer window to build his profile. That summer, he rose to national fame and attracted support from high-profile figures like Sarah Palin. Two months after the primary, Cruz defeated Dewhurst in the runoff. McDaniel won't have nearly as much time to solidify a victory, but being so close to a win may only make his supporters want it that much more. No matter who has more momentum, the runoff certainly seems poised to become another supercharged fight between the establishment and tea party Republicans. Race gets ugly in the Mississippi mud . 2. Hog wild in Iowa: The free-for-all that was the Iowa Republican Senate primary turned into a landslide victory for Joni Ernst over three other major GOP candidates. Ernst went from a little-known state senator to the front-runner who enjoyed support from major mainstream GOP groups and anti-establishment and tea party organizations. She also won endorsements from such high-profile Republicans as Palin, Romney and Marco Rubio. The big question going into Tuesday's primary was whether Ernst would crack the 35% threshold and avoid a runoff. If not, the nomination would have been decided a week later by some 2,000 delegates at the Iowa GOP convention. The final public opinion poll going into the primary had Ernst at 36%. When the primary results were in, Ernst grabbed 56% of the vote. So how did she do it? Some provocative ads definitely helped. ""I'm Joni Ernst. I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork,"" Ernst said in the first TV commercial of her campaign. That spot, which first aired in late March, not only made Ernst more recognizable in the Hawkeye State, but also across the nation. A second commercial showed Ernst, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard, riding up to a gun range on a motorcycle. ""With little name ID and even less money to introduce herself to Iowans earlier this year, her clever ads were undoubtedly the spark that fueled tonight's impressive victory,"" Iowa Republican consultant Matt Strawn, a former chairman of the state GOP, told CNN on Tuesday night. And Iowa Republican strategist Tim Albrecht, who is supporting Ernst, said ""the ads were successful because they were genuine Joni. She has been under-estimated from the beginning, and proved tonight she is a candidate to be reckoned with in November."" Ernst joked about her now-famous hog castration commercial in her victory speech, saying ""I grew up ... canning food and feeding hogs on our family farm, and yes, some of you may know I did more than just feed the hogs."" Ernst hopes to make history in November as the first woman to represent Iowa in Congress. In the midterm elections, she'll face Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who was unopposed in his party's primary. The winner of November's general election will succeed longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who is retiring at the end of the year. Republicans feel they have a good shot at flipping Harkin's seat, in their drive to retake the Senate. GOP candidate gets mainstream and anti-establishment backing . 3. Open primaries have consequences . No one questioned whether Democrat Jerry Brown, who's bidding for an unprecedented fourth term as California governor, was the overwhelming favorite in Tuesday's Golden State primary. The big question was whom the incumbent would face off with come November. For the first time in a gubernatorial race, California held an open, or ""jungle,"" primary, where all candidates compete in a single contest and the first and second place finishers, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election. Second place went to former Bush administration treasury official Neel Kashkari, who edged out state Rep. Tim Donnelly, a fellow Republican. Kashkari's a moderate who is best known for managing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), better known as the Wall Street bailouts, during President George W. Bush's last year in office. He's also a supporter of immigration reform, same-sex marriage and abortion rights. The tea party-backed Donnelly is an outspoken supporter of the rights of gun owners and a fierce opponent of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Kashkari's victory could make a difference for the party's chances in the general election. Some GOP strategists told CNN they were concerned that if Donnelly won, it would hurt Republican candidates in down-ballot races in a state where the general election electorate is much more moderate than that of the GOP primary. It's also more than fair to say that in a traditional GOP primary, which is dominated by conservatives, Kashkari would have had a much tougher time beating Donnelly. ""Everybody's going to study it and find things to love and hate about the open primary system,"" said CNN chief national correspondent John King. ""There are some grass-roots conservatives who think establishment Republicans are looking for every way under the sun to weaken them. They will now point to the open primary system as an example, since their party's gubernatorial nominee in California is a man who not only supported the Wall Street bailouts, but actually administered them,"" King added. 4. Romney's candidates clean up: Romney has the Midas touch this election season. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee continued his winning streak Tuesday with three of the GOP candidates he endorsed winning their primaries. Romney campaigned with Ernst in Iowa and cut an online ad for the Chamber of Commerce supporting her candidacy. His endorsement adds some establishment GOP backing to the conservative favorite, who also enjoys support from tea party power players like Palin. In California, Romney backed Kashkari, who came in second and now advances to November's general election. Also in California, Romney threw his support behind former state Rep. Tony Strickland, who co-chaired both of his presidential bids, in the state's 25th Congressional District. Strickland came in first in the vote count, which sends him on to the general election. The winner of that contest will go on to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. After failing to nab the White House from President Barack Obama, Romney backed away from the spotlight briefly before jumping back into the political fray, surprising many with his involvement in the 2014 election cycle. So far this election cycle, he's endorsed or donated money to some 20 candidates, many of them GOP establishment favorites who backed Romney in his White House runs. Two weeks ago, two other candidates he had backed scored high-profile primary victories. Romney endorsed and recorded a robocall for Dr. Monica Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon who won the GOP Senate primary in Oregon over a more conservative state lawmaker. The same night, eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho beat back a serious primary challenge from a tea party-backed candidate. Romney had endorsed Simpson and starred in a television commercial put out by the Chamber of Commerce that backed Simpson. Asked last week about his winning track record when it comes to primary endorsements, Romney told reporters: ""I wish I can take credit for that. The candidates take credit for that, and I am sure we will have some successes and some that are not successful."" Mississippi GOP primary race too close to call .

"(CNN) -- One of the most influential figures in Middle Eastern media says he is stunned by the speed and scale of the chaos unleashed by Sunni insurgents in Iraq, and sees no early end to it. ""The Middle East is beyond clarity, beyond understanding,"" said Wadah Khanfar, former director general of the Al Jazeera news network and now head of an Istanbul think tank trying to influence the future of the region. Speaking at a journalism conference in Barcelona, Khanfar portrayed the crisis as a new and extremely dangerous phase in an ongoing breakup of historic borders and political structures, set up largely by the West and imposed on the Arab world since colonial times. The 2011 Arab Spring was the hopeful ignition of popular discontent against historic leaders and norms, but its suppression in most places where it flared up had combined with the crisis in Syria to ignite war from protest, he said. ""Political Islam is merging into terrorism,"" said Khanfar, speaking last week at the Global Editors Network, which promotes innovation and debate among journalists. Khanfar admitted he was probably too optimistic about the long-term impact of the outpouring of popular discontent that overthrew long-established dictatorships and military regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, and fueled the western military intervention that helped topple Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. He said he foresaw a future in which the ouster of the elected Muslim Brotherhood government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt combined with a military takeover in Libya, the crisis in Iraq and the three year-civil war in Syria, would give potential moderates little room to exert political power. Into that vacuum comes violence and terror. ""An arc of crisis will emerge from Basra up to Tripoli ... gangsters, militant groups, trafficking, everything, but not states,"" he said. Khanfar, who created the most powerful media network in the Middle East with the backing of the ruling family of Qatar, is a veteran of two Gulf Wars and both covered and directed coverage of two decades of upheaval. Yet even he is stunned by the scale of the crisis in Iraq where Sunni militants of ISIS, emboldened by gains on the battlefield in Syria, have moved across the border. ""We have seen the most amazing collapse of any army we have seen in the last decades,"" Khanfar said. Without apologizing for the brutality of those attacks or attempting to justify it, Khanfar was clear that the move of ISIS into Iraq to intervene against what it sees as a heretic and sectarian Shia government, was directly connected to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and decades of hypocrisy and ignorance by Western powers. He said he believed Western reluctance to intervene in Syria, a readiness to leave ""generals"" in charge in Egypt, Libya and Yemen and to hand Iraq to a Shia-dominated administration in thrall to Iran, had combined to make the situation ripe for extremists to take charge across the region. Ultimately that would threaten not only Iraq and Syria but all existing borders in the Arab world and eventually Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States he predicted. The ISIS crisis and its easy move across into Iraq from Syria highlighted how irrelevant the borders imposed by France and Britain on the Arab world nearly 100 years ago are, he said. ""The state in the Arab world is a joke and it is something we should confront,"" said Khanfar, whose new venture, the Sharq Forum, aims to promote dialogue and discussion about long-term change in the region. Critics see the former journalist as too close to Islamists, a charge which he rejects. He has also faced the strange situation of being attacked by U.S. leaders while accused of being in their pay. The fragility of borders and of states created after World War I by colonial powers will put huge strain on Gulf States and region, he predicts. ""Everything is in a state of flux,"" he said. ""If this region continues to disintegrate ... I think this region will be the most dangerous against the rest of the world."" What can Western nations, particularly the United States, do to deal with the new situation? Khanfar suggested they should stop thinking that supporting old-style military leaders in Egypt and elsewhere would put a cap on the forces of discontent unleashed by the Arab Spring. ""The current situation is actually shameful, [with] no morality and no ethics ... one of the worst deeds that the West is perpetrating against the Arab world,"" he said. The West may also have to accept a redrawing of borders that were never truly accepted by those living within them and rethink the role of Iran. ""There is a major mess when it comes to the strategic thinking of our leaders.""","Wadah Khanfar is the former director general of Al Jazeera and now head of an Istanbul think tank .

"Washington (CNN) -- Walk into Rep. Peter King's Capitol Hill office, and you are overwhelmed with how much the New York Republican is consumed by the September 11, 2001, attacks. There are photos on the walls of funerals he attended, images of a smoky Brooklyn Bridge, and baseball caps with sayings including ""USS New York, Never Forget."" King says he doesn't have a monopoly on grief -- but it is what drives him. ""If you ask me what I think about going to work every day, it's 9/11 and preventing another 9/11. There were too many people I knew,"" he told CNN in an interview in his office. That's why he says he is determined to use his powerful post as House Homeland Security Committee chairman to hold a series of highly controversial hearings on what he has dubbed radicalization of Muslims in the United States. ""I have no choice, I have to hold these hearings, these hearings are absolutely essential,"" King said before the first hearing in March. ""There are elements in that community that are being radicalized, and I believe that the leadership, the leaders of that community, do not face up to that reality. Too many cases are not cooperative, not willing to speak out and condemn this type of radicalization that is going on,"" he insisted. The fact that he is singling out the Muslim-American community has ignited protests and anger against him, and accusations of bigotry. He has even been compared to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who used a congressional gavel he wielded in the 1950s to go on a Communist witch hunt. King said there is ""no basis"" for that. ""I tell people wait and watch and listen to the hearing and they will see it will be a thoughtful, meaningful, very fair hearing,"" he said. King once had a close bond with leaders in the Muslim-American community. In the 1990s, he broke with fellow Republicans and backed President Bill Clinton's military efforts in the Balkans to defend Muslims there. ""That was not popular in my district, but I did it because it was the right thing to do. I thought the Muslim populations in those countries were being victimized,"" said King. Though the Muslim community in his mostly blue-collar Long Island district is small, King had close relationships with Muslim leaders -- he even attended a ribbon-cutting at a local mosque. But King said after 9/11 a switch flipped. ""I saw the Muslim-American community not responding the way that they should have, covering up for al Qaeda, when they tried to blame it on Jews or the FBI -- I couldn't believe what I was hearing. These people -- I had known them for years, I had their relatives interning in my office, I had gone to weddings and dinners of leaders in the Muslim-American community -- and the same people that I had known, I hear them saying its not al Qaeda, it's the FBI. I couldn't believe it,"" recalled King. One of those leaders was Ghazi Khankan with the Islamic Center of Long Island. ""I said we should also investigate the possibility of Israel being involved. That changed his opinion 100%,"" said Khankan. King said he was furious that no Muslim leaders denounced those post-9/11 comments. But even worse, he insisted, was what he started hearing from law enforcement -- that the Muslim-American community was not cooperating with efforts to rein in radicalization and prevent terror threats. ""That would be psychobabble, to say that because of what was said after 9/11, I'm holding these hearings. That's when I first began to look more carefully,"" he said. ""Since then, it's dealing with police at all levels, in New York and around the country. ... Privately, I am told time and again that they're not getting the cooperation they need."" he said. King, the son of a New York police academy instructor and a self-described close friend of New York cops and firefighters, insists he gets the real story from his buddies about what they call lack of cooperation in the Muslim community in rooting out radicalism. But other law enforcement officials say they get valuable assistance from Muslim-Americans. And academic studies, like one conducted by Duke University and the University of North Carolina, show fellow American Muslims turned in 48 of the 120 Muslims suspected of plotting terror attacks on the U.S. since 9/11. King insists that doesn't jibe with what he hears on the ground. ""I can tell you that in New York, we're in the epicenter, we're in the eye of the storm. There has been no virtually no real cooperation coming from the Muslim-American community. The police commissioner's office in (Suffolk County) has said that they have not gotten one tip from the Muslim-American community,"" he said. Still, King invited no law enforcement officials to be witnesses at the March hearing -- neither the FBI director, nor the attorney general, nor any of the New York officials who he says tell him they're concerned. The only one who attended was Los Angeles Sheriff Leroy Baca because he was invited by Democrats on the panel. Some call King's efforts against American Muslim terrorism hypocritical. In the 1980s, King, an Irish-American, was an active supporter of Gerry Adams and the Irish Republican Army, an organization the State Department then deemed terrorists, which was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths in terror attacks. King defends his efforts. ""I knew what was happening in Northern Ireland, and with the IRA. The IRA was a legitimate force, they'd been there for 40 years, 60 years, any way you want to look at it,"" said King. He insists he only got involved so heavily with Adams because he knew he would be willing to broker peace with the British government. ""I was one of those helped bring (peace) about. This isn't me saying it, it's Tony Blair and Bill Clinton saying that, among others,"" said King, who later pointed to a photo on his wall of Blair, the former British prime minister, with an inscription praising King for his role in the Northern Ireland Peace Accord. The New York Times editorialized before the March hearing that King is a man ""obsessed"" with Muslim radicalism. Is he obsessed? ""I'm very focused,"" he replied. ""I lost many people from my (congressional) district on 9/11, and within a 30-mile radius of my home, probably about a thousand people murdered on 9/11."" Another answer to that question may be in what King writes about. He is a part-time novelist, and in 2004 published a book called ""Vale of Tears,"" about an Irish-American congressman from New York who traces a terrorist attack to Muslim radicals in his own district. ""You write about what you know,"" shrugged King. If the negative publicity and protests about his hearing are getting to King, he's hiding it well. ""Hey, I would love to be loved, you know, I'm not a masochist. But on the other hand, I have a job to do. And I would not want to wake up the day after an attack and say, 'I should've done something differently,'"" he said. ""My goal, if I could have an ultimate goal, is to have new leaders emerge from within the Muslim community, who are not defensive, who day in, day out, are willing to denounce radicalizations, denounce the attempts by al Qaeda to go into their communities.""

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian authorities said they have five suspects in custody Sunday after a wave of attacks over the weekend in the city of Kano. Five people were killed and eight others injured when an explosive device was lobbed over a wall in Kano's predominantly Christian Sabon Gari district. The attack occurred as parishioners exited St. Charles Catholic Church following Sunday services, according to Nigerian police force spokesman Frank Mba. Mba said three suspects have been arrested ""for their complicity in the attacks."" A suicide attack occurred earlier in the day at another location in Kano. A woman detonated a bomb after police stopped her and sent for a policewoman to come perform a search, according to Mba. Five officers were injured in that attack, which killed the bomber. Two suicide blasts kill 40 in Nigeria . In a third incident, authorities were tipped off to an explosive-laden car parked near the Isyaku Rabiu mosque in another section of the city Saturday evening. Kano police spokesman Magaji Musa Majia said the bomb squad was able to successfully defuse a remote-controlled improvised explosive device discovered in its trunk. Mba said two suspects have been arrested and were being interrogated Sunday night. Hassan John reported from Jos; Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano.

"(CNN) -- It's a sweltering May afternoon in Hong Kong. In Tsim Sha Tsui, facing the city's iconic skyline, a Russian couple poses -- a slender woman with impeccable style drags her boyfriend by the hand toward the skyscrapers across the harbor. Nearby, a hoard of journalists takes their own pictures of this couple taking pictures. It's all for a perfect Instagram shot. This is the couple behind, or in front of, the ""Follow Me To"" project. The images of Natalia Zakharova leading her photographer boyfriend, Murad Osmann, toward exotic, picturesque locations around the globe took off last year, and Osmann's Instagram account now has more than 1.1 million followers. All the images are taken in the same style: from Murad's perspective showing just his extended arm and Natalia's back against beautiful backdrops. The project started accidentally in 2011 during a holiday in Barcelona when Natalia got frustrated with snap-happy Murad, who was pre-occupied taking pictures of the city. ""This is just a hobby,"" says Natalia. ""We're not thinking about being famous at all."" Will Russia follow them? Now, the Hong Kong Tourism Board has commissioned the pair to lure more Russian tourists to the city. Out of the 54 million tourist arrivals in Hong Kong last year, 223,664 came from Russia. That's a 20% increase from 2012. Russians spend more than any other tourists (HK$9,258 ($1,190) per person, on average), including those from Mainland China (HK$8,937), according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. The couple have taken their signature images at some of Hong Kong's top tourist spots -- such as the Choi Hung Estate -- as part of the Tourism Board's social media campaign. The first two images were revealed over the last week and the rest will be released one by one leading up to winter, a key travel season for Russians, explains a HK Tourism Board spokesperson. Both Zakharova and Osmann have day jobs back in Moscow -- she's a journalist and he's a film director -- that they try to juggle with this continuously expanding project. ""It's really hard to balance our jobs and all the travel,"" says Murad. ""We plan ahead -- we speak to the local photographers and communities for recommendations. Then we have to take weekends out. ""We have to take up to 20 dresses with us [for Natalia] to see what looks best and all the equipment. It's not an easy project -- it's not a holiday."" In future we can expect to see short travel video guides from the couple, comprising behind-the-scenes footage of the creation of each image as well as walking viewers through each destination's history and culture. ""It's not a commercial project,"" says Natalia. ""Each city, each country has its own unique character. We love all of the places.""

"(CNN) -- The current rift between Israel and the Obama administration over the terms of a cease-fire in Gaza is empowering hard-liners in the Israeli government and in Hamas who don't want to end the fighting. In recent days, the Israeli media has been full of personal attacks on U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry over a draft cease-fire document he transmitted last weekend. The State Department says what it sent was a ""clearly labeled confidential draft of ideas, sent in order to get Israeli comments, as part of an effort closely coordinated with the Israelis to explore a possible basis for a cease-fire."" It was never intended to be an outright proposal demanding a yes or no answer from Israel. So administration officials were understandably shocked when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting of his Security Cabinet, which voted unanimously to reject the document -- and it was quickly leaked to the Israeli media, promoting a firestorm of invective against Kerry. Although we don't know, and probably will never know, who leaked this confidential document, it is clear that this dispute serves the interests of those within the Israeli Cabinet who want to expand the military operation, possibly to encompass a temporary reoccupation of all of Gaza so Israel can destroy the Hamas military infrastructure and kill or capture its leaders and as many of its fighters as possible. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman is among those advocating that Israel ""go all the way"" by reoccupying all of Gaza. Some former generals are supporting him. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon oppose this idea, which some analysts believe could take several months and cost hundreds of Israeli and thousands of Palestinian lives with no certainty of ultimate success. Still, in recent days, Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have started speaking of demilitarizing Hamas as one of their demands to end the fighting. Kerry and President Obama have endorsed this idea as a long-term goal. But in the short-term, it is impractical without totally defeating Hamas -- and that's not going to happen. The rift between the Obama administration and the Israeli government must be healed as soon as possible to prevent this war from escalating even further. Israel has the right to demolish the tunnels it has discovered that lead under the Israeli border and threaten villages and civilians. The Kerry cease-fire agreement would have allowed them to continue that work. But beyond that, responsible leaders in both countries must acknowledge there is no military solution to this conflict and that Palestinian civilians, who have been cynically exploited by Hamas, are suffering unendurable losses. The Israeli government has a vital interest in supporting Kerry's efforts to get massive humanitarian aid into Gaza and also fostering longer-term projects to spur economic development there. In the middle of a war, it is natural to want one's own side to strike a shattering blow from which the enemy cannot quickly or easily recover. But Israel needs to offer the people of Gaza some hope. People without hope have nothing to lose. They are the wellspring of support for Hamas and even more extreme groups. Netanyahu may not have wanted this war and has probably been dragged in deeper than he anticipated. He tried to avoid a ground operation and delayed it as long as he could. He accepted a cease-fire agreement that Hamas rejected. But history is rich with examples of conflicts that escalated far beyond the intentions of those who launched them. It happened exactly 100 years ago in August 1914. It happened to the United States in 2003 when it invaded Iraq. It also happened to Israel when it invaded Lebanon in 1982. Israel should pay heed and, with U.S. and international help, avoid at all costs going down that same disastrous road once again.","Alan Elsner: Israel-U.S. rift over Secretary Kerry's cease-fire plan empowers hard-liners .

"(CNN) -- The ferry that capsized on April 16 with 459 passengers onboard off the coast of South Korea was headed to Jeju Island, the country's biggest island and one of South Korea's nine provinces. The island is South Korea's most popular holiday island, attracting 10 million visitors in 2013, according to government statistics. More than 70% of visitors are domestic travelers, seeking out what has become known as the ""Hawaii of South Korea."" The island is well known for natural wonders, including waterfalls, white sand beaches and a dormant volcano -- South Korea's highest mountain -- at the center of the island. April to June is prime time for school field trips to Jeju Island, say Korea Tourism officials. It's estimated that more than 300 high school students were on the ferry, traveling from the city of Ansan to Jeju for a four-day excursion. In 2007, UNESCO inscribed ""Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes"" onto its list of World Heritage Sites, highlighting Geomunoreum, ""regarded as the finest lava tube system of caves anywhere, with its multicoloured carbonate roofs and floors, and dark-coloured lava walls."" In 2011, Jeju Island was named one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature. Jeju is also home to haenyo divers, also known as ""Korean mermaids."" These women, often elderly, have taken up diving the ocean for abalone, sea urchin, octopus and seaweed. The volcanic landscape -- 90% of Jeju's surface is basalt -- has given rise to other attractions, such as grandfather stones (dolharubang), massive phallic statues that resemble Easter Island's moai. The island is also home to the Loveland theme park, dedicated to sex and eroticism. In September 2013, Jeju Island was in the news after a Chinese luxury cruise ship was detained for issues related to a legal proceeding over outstanding lease payments. Quick facts . • Located 64 kilometers south of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju is one of nine South Korean provinces and is the country's most popular holiday island. • Jeju Island is 1,848 square kilometers and has a population of about 600,000 people. • In 2013, more than 10 million tourists visited Jeju according to government statistics. More than 70% were domestic visitors. • The capital of the island is Jeju City. • Jeju's city of Seogwipo co-hosted the 2002 Korea/Japan FIFA World Cup. • Jeju is 434 kilometers south of Seoul. The flight time between the two locations is just over an hour. Jeju International Airport services regular direct flights to cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing and Shanghai.","Jeju Island, or Jejudo, is South Korea's most popular holiday island with 10 million visitors in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Drones are our latest Frankenstein's monster. But our preoccupation with their novelty -- with the ethical hazards of remote killing and the possible violation, through surveillance, of life and privacy at home -- has obscured their roots in the deadly history of Western aerial control of the Middle East that began in World War I, exactly a century ago. As we recall the myriad ways in which that epochal war remade our world, it is time also to reckon with its unleashing of air power in the Middle East. Air power harks back to Civil War-era hot-air balloons and was used all over the theaters of World War I for reconnaissance, bombardment, and aerial combat. However, its potential was most rigorously tested and developed in the British campaign against the Ottoman Empire during that war. Aerial photography and signaling, the airlift, the aerial trap (bombardment of the head and tail of a column retreating through a canyon) -- all were developed in WWI's Mesopotamia and Palestine campaigns, fought in the area of present-day Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula, north through Syria. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . The British fought these campaigns to safeguard the all-important land, air, and sea routes to British India and oil assets in the Persian Gulf. Aircraft were used in bombardments that wrecked trains and in irregular warfare, where they, for example, helped Arab guerrillas fighting the British-backed revolt against the Ottomans communicate and conduct reconnaissance. They were also used in deception strategies, such as in providing air cover to conceal troop movements before the surprise British attack at Megiddo. Most significantly, for the history of drones, their uses in colonial policing were discovered there and would echo through the century. When the tribes the British had ""liberated"" from Turkish rule in the war ""got out of hand,"" aerial bombardment became an instrument of everyday colonial discipline, inspiring ""terror in the Arabs,"" official memos noted approvingly. Opinion: When chemical weapons killed 90,000 . Aircraft seemed a panacea for what the British categorized as ""tribal"" situations. Thus did the postwar British Cabinet declare that it was in the Middle East that ""the war ... proved that the air has capabilities of its own."" We may have forgotten this past, but in the region, memory of it shapes the response to American drones and airstrikes today. All this came about because of World War I-era British notions of the particular suitability of air power to the Middle East. Officials who guided the military effort in the region saw it as a land of mystery impervious to ordinary observation. Surveillance aircraft seemed to promise vision beyond the mirages, sandstorms, and distances that made it unmappable in their estimation. Commanders relied on them for ""obtaining ... accurate information'' in a land where ''little can be trusted that is seen."" And they provided access to forbidden sites. Conceiving the region as uniformly flat (despite its marshes, mountains and cities), British Arabists assumed it afforded no cover. In fact, there were real limits to using aircraft even in the desert, but the idea of ""knights of the air"" providing panoramic surveillance of an inscrutable antique land proved irresistible. So too did the image of aircraft turning Mesopotamia into a hub of modern transportation and thus restoring its status as the cradle of civilization, in some measure redeeming the material and human losses of the war. Opinion: Should nations pay the price for their leaders' misdeeds? British officials made much of the ""natural fellow-feeling between ... nomad arabs and the Air Force ... both ... in conflict with the vast elemental forces of nature."" Arabs could uniquely endure the violence of bombardment, Britons thought: In a biblical land, tragedy was a ""normal way of life"" and bombardment understood as an ""act of God."" These wartime experiments with aerial bombardment and surveillance produced the postwar ""aerial control"" regime in the region, a discreet and cheap mechanism for colonial rule in an increasingly anti-imperial world. Because the British thought of the Middle East as a region where all information was suspect and deception was everywhere, they saw casualty counts and accountability for errors -- like bombardment of the wrong town or tribe -- as superfluous. Opinion: How World War I gave us 'cooties' After the war, the British Royal Flying Corps survived as an independent military service, rechristened the Royal Air Force, because of this role in the Middle East. The British used the RAF to police the new British territories in the Middle East with aerial surveillance and bombardment. This technique, known as ""aerial control,"" spread to Palestine, Somalia, Yemen, and what we call ""AfPak"" -- precisely where drones reign today. It was in Iraq and Afghanistan that British airmen in World War I and the interwar period -- including Arthur Harris, zealous head of Bomber Command in World War II -- acquired the experience they applied in the next world war. Opinion: The mighty women of World War I . The British state propagated a myth of successful air control in the Middle East, but the technique never really worked. The British presence provoked insurgency and undermined local governments until the Iraqi revolution of 1958, when the United States began its interventions in the region. Those who live under drones see them as the latest chapter in a long history of Western efforts to dominate the region with air power. The ""Reaper"" dropping ""Hellfire"" missiles again styles bombardment as a biblical fate. Today, too, casualties are not published and all the dead in a strike zone are presumed to be militants. Opinion: The 'bionic men' of World War I . We would do well to recall this aerial history of the very region where drones found their initial justification. Remote piloting was always an objective of aerial warfare; drones follow rocket warfare and cruise missiles. Aerial warfare was always about minimizing casualties on one side and pursuing empire discreetly. Drones may be more precise than earlier aircraft, but the principle of cowing a population with ubiquitous surveillance and exemplary violence, without arousing the ire of a democratic public at home, remains their underlying principle. So, too, do notions of the Middle East's particular suitability to aerial control. In our shock at the new, we have overlooked these Great War roots. In their recovery lies crucial insight into why an aerial strategy will fail in the Middle East, piloted remotely or on the spot.

"(CNN) -- The headlines for the new season of ABC's ""The Bachelor"" read: ""The Bachelor returns with its first Latino,"" ""Hola, Juan Pablo,"" and ""Expect 'lots of Latino' fun."" And millions are tuning in to watch Juan Pablo Galavis, a 32-year-old former professional soccer player who is American-born but grew up in Venezuela. The ""sexy, hot-blooded Latino"" is one of many stereotypes that is prevalent in Hollywood. And, as the Hispanic population continues to grow, more and more attention is being drawn to how Latinos are represented in television and film. While it may seem harmless to portray Latinos as sexy, these typecasts limit the roles for actors in Hollywood, said actor Esai Morales. ""Latinos are either cast as either the overly hormonal (""Oh mamacita, I have to have you""), overly hysterical (""Lucy!""), overly hostile (""I'll cut you sucka!""), or overly humble (""We are a poor people""),"" Morales told CNN in a recent interview. Those, according to Morales, are the ""four H's of Hollywood"" that make up Hollywood's patronizing formula for Latino actors. And, Morales said, it's the reason why Hispanics rarely play heroes or leaders. ""It's just broad strokes,"" said Morales, whose acting credits include ""24,"" ""NYPD Blue,"" and ""Criminal Minds."" ""I don't want to be the 'spice' added to a show, I'm not a condiment!"" Just last month, Britney Spears unknowingly touched on two of those stereotypes during an interview with Univision. When asked what Spears likes most about Latino culture, she said: ""I think it's very sexy. I've always loved Latinos. They make me think of a bad-boy type that your father wouldn't let you go out with."" Some gossip websites seized on her comments, describing them as ""racist,"" which might be a stretch. ""She didn't mean it badly, but it shows how seriously under-educated she is and how little big stars know about the Latino community,"" Morales said. Hispanic marketing expert Gabriel Reyes said America's pervasive need to sexualize Latinos as ""exotics"" is based on strong archetypes that have been built up for generations within Latino culture. Because of that, Reyes said, stereotypes like the Latin lover, the Latina bombshell, or the meek and lowly servant will take a long time to be eradicated from film and television. The National Hispanic Media Coalition commissioned a study on the impact of media portrayals of Latinos and immigrants that revealed that news and entertainment media have a strong influence on non-Latinos' perceptions of Latinos and immigrants. In other words, media plays an integral part in how a certain group of people are viewed and that has profound consequences in society. That's something Spears' comments reflect, according to Reyes. ""Britney is simply another non-Latino stating what so many already believe,"" said Reyes, president of Reyes Entertainment. The National Hispanic Media Coalition supports ABC in selecting the first minority bachelor in the show's 11-year history. But the coalition's president said there's room for improvement. ""Within one Latino family you'll have those who are very light to a very dark complexion, a whole spectrum of coloration,"" said coalition president and CEO Alex Nogales. ""While Juan Pablo's presence on 'The Bachelor' is a step in the right direction, I would love to see more Latinos on screen that are mestizos."" The New York Post wrote that ABC's bachelor pick ""looks so white he could easily slip into a Mitt Romney family photo."" Most Latinos identify as mestizo, a mix of indigenous and European descent, but -- like ""The Bachelor"" star -- not all Latinos are olive-skinned with dark hair. Some Latinos are black like Victor Cruz or Tristan Wilds and others look completely European, like Vanna White or Ryan Lochte. Latin America's diverse racial demographics are from a mixed-race background made up of European, African and indigenous cultures. Galavis may not represent the typical Hispanic man, but he is very much Latino. The show declined to comment on why it chose Galavis, but his ""Latino"" presence seems more like a strategic business move than a newfound love for the Latino community. In 2012, a class action lawsuit was filed against the reality show's producers, accusing them of racial discrimination. The suit was eventually dismissed by a judge who ruled it couldn't survive First Amendment review. No network wants that kind of publicity, especially since ABC falls within the top three rated networks in measured Hispanic households, a coveted audience with a collective buying power of more than $1 trillion, mostly driven by Latinas, according to Nielsen. Galavis' ethnicity and the fact he has such a light complexion can kill two birds with one stone: appealing to the Hispanic audience while still carrying general market appeal. Reyes believes Latinos have bigger fish to fry, with immigration reform high on the list of priorities for many and midterm elections around the corner. ""Latinos have other things to worry about, like the lack of voter participation. That's where the key to exercising our power lies,"" Reyes said. When ""Modern Family"" debuted, the show received a lot of flak and praise for casting Sofia Vergara as Gloria Pritchett, the trophy wife of Jay Pritchett. Supporters applauded ABC for giving the role to a Latina actress, but critics said she was playing up the role of the stereotypical ""hysterical loud Latina."" Morales believes in order to break the stereotype cycle in Hollywood, a combination of things need to happen: Sought after talents like director Steven Spielberg need to tell the stories of the Hispanic community, and more Latinos need to be producers and directors, to help tell these stories the right way. He said that's starting to happen. ""Did I mention I'm taking on a new job?"" Morales said. ""I get to play the president of the United States!"" Morales is referring to his starring role as President Julian Navarro on ""The Brink,"" an upcoming pilot on HBO that also stars Tim Robbins and Jack Black, who are also reportedly producing the new series. While the Spearses of the world and tacky marketing tactics may still get their moment in the sun, Morales said he thinks Hollywood has gotten better than when he started. ""It's up to us (Latino actors) now. There are a lot more Latino characters on TV now. The key is to not let it just be a 'Latino wave,' and to be undeniably good.""","Are stereotypes in Hollywood harmless or harmful?

"Silver Springs, Nevada (CNN) -- The helicopter is on the chase. At first, you can only hear it. Then, from behind the hillside, you see a herd of wild horses running for their freedom, with the helicopter close behind. One escapes the trap, barely. The crowd cheers. This is the scene at the Lahontan wild horse roundup in Silver Springs, Nevada. The helicopter pilot works for the federal government.  The crowd is composed mainly of activists opposed to the roundups. More and more, the roundups are becoming showdowns between protesters and the Bureau of Land Management. ""They are by law supposed to protect these horses, and in fact they are doing the exact opposite -- they are exterminating them,"" says Simone Netherlands, founder of the advocacy group Respect 4 Horses. ""They are managing them to extinction."" BLM says this charge is not true, insisting there are more wild horses and burros today than there were in 1971, when it started the roundup program. That year, fearing that the wild horses and small donkeys roaming the open ranges of the western United States were disappearing, Congress decided to try to save them. A rare unanimous vote in 1971 directed the secretary of the interior to protect and manage these horses and burros, as much a part of the American West as the cowboy. But as the number of animals began to grow, the program began to shift to population control.  And that has triggered an outcry from wild-horse advocates, which really began to resonate in 2010. Members of Congress and other wildlife organizations paid closer attention to the issue last year, because the bureau removed more horses and burros in 2010 than in nearly any other year. The bureau says there are about 33,700 wild horses and 4,700 burros roaming on BLM ranges in 10 Western states. If they were left on their own, the population would explode, according to the bureau. The government's plan is to reduce the number of animals by 12,000. That would leave about 26,600 horses and burros on the 26 million acres set aside for these animals to live, according to the BLM. Much of the public land on which the bureau manages the wild mustangs is also home to other wildlife and livestock. Some of the land is used for recreational and mining interests. ""We have to manage for all users,"" says Alan Shepard, the head of BLM's Nevada office.  ""We can't let one, say the horse, impact everybody else by taking all the feed, all the water."" After they are rounded up, some of the wild horses are trained by prisoners at nearby correctional facilities.  Once the horses are broken, the prison can auction them off for about $1,500 per animal. Read more about the prisoner program . The problem isn't the horses, says Netherlands, but the cattle that are allowed to graze on the same land. The BLM is charged with deciding how many wild horses should reside on each herd management area. At the Lahontan roundup, authorities decided that the 11,000 acres could support between seven and 10 horses. There were 117 horses on the property, so the BLM rounded up all the mustangs and then selected seven to release back into the wild. But how do they determine the ratio of horses to land? Activists insist that number of horses the government finds appropriate for the land -- which is based on water and food -- is not scientific.  The study determining the number of horses that will remain in the Lahontan management area was done in the mid-1990s. In addition, there is no water on the Lahontan land. The horses drink from water sources on adjacent state park land. When asked how Lahontan ever became a herd management area to begin with, Shepard did not know. In Nevada, there are just seven people handling 85 herd management areas covering millions of acres. ""So, we are pretty thin,"" admits Shepard. ""It takes a lot of work to collect that data, a lot of time and effort, so we're not as effective as we possibly could be. We hope to be better."" What is effective, according to Shepard, is the use of helicopters in rounding up the horses and burros. ""We can do our management in a quicker, shorter period of time that reduces that level of impact,"" he says. The helicopters may reduce the time to round up the mustangs, but it gives activists another argument. ""To be rounded up in the way that it is done with helicopters, being run for miles and miles and miles -- it's brutal,"" says Netherlands. ""It's barbaric and it does not need to be done this way."" Her group has proposed a method where a water source would be fenced off and once the horses enter, the gate would be closed behind them. Many activists opposed to the use of helicopters point to a roundup earlier this year known as ""Calico,"" in which more than 100 horses died. Activists attribute the deaths to the running of the horses in the cold over hard ground. The BLM insists most of the deaths were mares that could not adapt to the hay they were fed after they were captured. The roundups are open to the public and those attending are usually members of a wild horse advocacy group. Armed with cameras, they try to document what they call ""inhumane"" treatment of the wild horses. There is no disputing the incidents that are caught on tape when a helicopter skid bumps a horse or knocks a burro off its feet. ""This is not a risk-free operation and yes, horses do get killed,"" says Tom Gorey, spokesman for BLM.  But, he adds, ""we have a very low mortality rate of less than 1% from gather-related deaths."" Gorey says the activists would oppose the roundups even if there weren't any injuries, because they just want the management of the horses to stop. Ever since the problems during the Calico roundup, the fight between the two groups has intensified. When pressed about horses being injured by helicopter skids, Gorey goes on the defensive. ""It sounds like you bought into their point of view,"" he says. An objective view was hard to obtain during the Lahontan roundup, since the media were kept about a quarter of a mile away from where the horses were being corralled. Shepard says the safety of the horses and the men rounding them up is his first priority. The reason we were kept so far away, says Shepard, is because if we were any closer, our cameras might spook the horses. ""They do not want the issue on camera. Period,"" says Richard Couto, the founder of Animal Recovery Mission, pointing out how the horses are already spooked by the helicopter. The question of access is currently an issue in a court case bought by a wild-horse advocate. Many of the activists' issues pertaining to the roundups have been brought into the courts, most unsuccessfully. They also hold protests, some as far away as New York. There have also been calls for President Obama to impose a moratorium on the roundup. The only real progress thus far for the activists came from a group of members of Congress, who encouraged the bureau to ask for an independent study of its Wild Horse and Burro Program. It will take the National Academy of Sciences two years to complete its assessment. In the meantime, the wild mustangs of the West will continue to be rounded up. The activists say they will continue to be on hand, cheering for the ones that get away -- even if, like the one who dodged the trap at Lahontan, their freedom lasts only a few more minutes.

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- The mystery behind the killing of a nationally renowned law professor has authorities in Florida asking for the public's help. Investigators with the Tallahassee Police Department are seeking tips from anyone who might have encountered Florida State University professor Daniel Markel before he was found shot in the head at his home this month. In a Monday news release, authorities asked anyone to come forward who might have seen Markel in specific areas, mostly on the north end of the city, but also near the centrally located FSU law school where he taught. A department spokesman didn't comment on why authorities are looking into those particular areas. Police went to the professor's home on July 18 after receiving a call from Markel's neighbor, who told officers he heard a loud bang before seeing a vehicle drive away from his house. When he went to investigate, he found his neighbor inside his garage, in the driver's seat of his car, bleeding and in a daze. The driver's side window of the car had been bashed open, the report says. A heavily redacted police report released Friday states there was no sign of forced entry, which Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway said could mean Markel knew the shooter. The report does not state whether the garage door was open. Also in the report, the neighbor told police a white or silver vehicle left the home, describing it as a Toyota Prius, or a Prius ""type"" of vehicle. Police on Wednesday released via social media a picture of a silver car they called a ""vehicle of interest."" Police on Facebook cautioned it may have been a resident, passerby or delivery driver. Northway told CNN that investigators used a nearby business' surveillance camera to capture an image of what appears to be a Prius. Police say there were no signs of a robbery and have yet to disclose a possible motive. They have been following up on more than 50 leads and offered a $3,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. In a news release Friday, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael J. DeLeo said, ""Our investigators are using all resources available to them and are continuing to explore all of the tips that we have received."" Police have been in contact with Markel's former wife, Wendi Adelson, also an FSU law professor, said her attorney, Jimmy Judkins. She is ""scared to death"" that the killer may be targeting her entire family, said Allen Grossman, a close family friend, who has known Markel and Adelson for several years. The couple had two sons together. Last week, Judkins told CNN his client has no idea why this happened. Markel began working at FSU in 2005 after receiving his bachelor's degree at Harvard College, a master's from the University of Cambridge and a law degree from Harvard. During his FSU tenure, the Toronto native taught several classes and wrote extensively about criminal law, including articles published in the Yale Law Review, among others. Markel also founded PrawfsBlawg, a blog focused on law and life, and his writing appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Slate, The Jerusalem Post and The Atlantic Monthly. On PrawfsBlawg, 10 fellow law professors posted about the respect they had for Markel and the mutual love he shared with his friends and family. ""His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life. We are stunned and bereaved by his loss, and our thoughts go to his two little boys, who were precious to him, and to his family.""

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Sen. Howard Baker, a one-time towering political figure in Washington who also served presidents and famously asked during the Watergate scandal what Richard Nixon knew and ""when did he know it,"" has died. He was 88. A Tennessee Republican, Baker made his political mark over four decades, serving as majority leader and also ran for president in 1980. Baker's former press secretary, Tom Griscom, confirmed that he died on Thursday. A statement released by Baker's wife, former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, and his two children from his first marriage, Darek Baker and Cynthia (Cissy) Baker, said his death was a ""time of sorrow and also a time for the celebration of a remarkable life."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would be remembered ""with fondness by members of both political parties."" Baker was first elected to the Senate in 1966 and led the chamber from 1981-85. He was Reagan's chief of staff from 1987-88, and was ambassador to Japan under President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama said in a statement that Baker's unofficial role as the ""Great Conciliator"" had ""won him admirers across party lines, over multiple generations, and beyond the state he called home."" Former President George H.W. Bush said Baker was ""adept at listening to the other guy state their position as he was at articulating his own."" CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger said Baker thrived an era when Democrats and Republicans often compromised to get things done in Washington. ""He was one of those senators who could walk across the aisle, cut deals and he was respected on both sides,"" Borger said. ""Today in the Republican Party, that would be taken as a negative."" Former first lady Nancy Reagan said in a statement that she and her husband had ""the greatest respect"" for Baker's dedication to service. ""Howard was one of Ronnie's most valued advisers, his integrity and ability to create cooperation between the Congress and the White House was unparalleled,"" she said. ""Most importantly, though, he was a good and trusted friend."" Baker also played a key role in the Watergate investigation that led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon. As the vice chairman and ranking Republican of the investigation into Nixon's connection to the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, Baker famously asked ""what did the President know and when did he know it.""

"(CNN) -- An R. Kelly concert appearance in Columbus, Ohio, has been canceled after protests. Kelly was scheduled to perform at the Fashion Meets Music Festival, scheduled for Labor Day weekend in the Ohio capital. But after a backlash on social media, the festival decided to drop the controversial singer, the festival's communications director, Melissa Dickson, said in a statement. ""The people of Columbus didn't feel that R. Kelly's reputation was reflective of their community, and took to social media to adamantly express their opinions. FMMF heard their concerns and took action,"" Dickson said. ""We wanted to celebrate the already thriving fashion and music communities in Columbus and produce a festival the city would be proud to call (its) own.

Kelly, best known for his hit song ""I Believe I Can Fly,"" has been the target of some protest since being accused of videotaping sex with a minor in the early 2000s. In 2008, Kelly was acquitted on 14 counts of making child pornography. The accusations received wider coverage last year in the wake of Kelly's latest CD, ""Black Panties,"" when The Village Voice ran a lengthy interview with former Chicago Sun-Times music critic Jim DeRogatis, who had worked on a series for the newspaper about lawsuits against the singer.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has restricted all planes traveling over Iraq from flying at or below 30,000 feet, a threshold similar to the altitude of a Malaysian airliner that was downed over Ukraine. The FAA restriction issued late Thursday comes in response to fighting in Iraq between government forces and rebel militants from Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The new Notice-To-Airmen (NOTAM) from the FAA also prohibits flights into and out of Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. Erbil, the capital of Iraq's semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, and Sulaymaniyah, a Kurdish controlled city, have been considered safe havens in the conflict, both housing thousands of refugees. The US has said Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was shot out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile, likely manned by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. That disaster, on July 17, killed all 298 people on board, and raised fears about the safety of international flights over conflict zones.","Planes traveling over Iraq must fly higher than 30,000 feet .

"(CNN) -- It began as horseplay, with two teenage stepbrothers chasing each other with blow guns and darts. But it soon escalated when one of the boys grabbed a knife. Michael Barton, Quantel Lotts' stepbrother, was stabbed to death at age 17. The older teen, Michael Barton, 17, was dead by the time he reached the hospital, stabbed twice.The younger boy, Quantel Lotts, 14, would eventually become one of Missouri's youngest lifers. Lotts was sentenced in Missouri's St. Francois County Circuit Court in 2002 to life in prison without parole for first-degree murder in his stepbrother's stabbing death. It made no difference that at the time of the deadly scuffle, Lotts was barely old enough to watch PG-13 movie and too young to drive, vote or buy beer. ""They locked me up and threw away the keys,"" Lotts, now 23, said from prison. ""They took away all hope for the future."" His stepmother, the victim's mother, has forgiven Lotts and is working with lawyers to gain his release. Lotts is one of at least 73 U.S. inmates -- most of them minorities -- who were sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison for crimes committed when they were 13 or 14, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit organization in Alabama that defends indigent defendants and prisoners. The 73 are just a fraction of the more than 2,000 offenders serving life sentences for crimes they committed as minors under the age of 18. Across the country, most juvenile offenders and many adults are given a second chance. Charles Manson, convicted in seven notorious murders committed when he was 27, will be eligible for his 12th parole hearing in 2012. He's been denied parole 11 times. Even ""Son of Sam"" killer David Berkowitz, who confessed to killing six people in the 1970s when he was in his 20s, has had four parole hearings, though he has said he doesn't deserve parole and doesn't want it. But Quantel Lotts has no hope for a parole hearing. At least not yet.  See which states have sentenced minors to life without parole » . Lotts is part of a trend that has developed over the past two decades. Numerous studies have shown that In the 1970s and 1980s, minors were rarely given life sentences, let alone life without parole, experts said. By the early 1990s, according to the Department of Justice, an alarming spike in juvenile homicides spawned a nationwide crackdown, including a movement to try kids in adult courts. ""Criminal court doesn't care they are kids,"" said Melissa Sickmund, chief of systems research at the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Once they are there, it's just another case."" Today, there are only a handful of states -- including Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oregon -- that prohibit sentencing minors to life without parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Proponents of the strict sentencing laws said public safety should be top priority. They argued that judges give certain criminals, regardless of their age, life sentences because the crimes are so abhorrent. ""There are some people who are so fundamentally dangerous that they can't walk among us,"" said Jennifer Jenkins, who co-founded the National Organization for Victims of Juvenile Lifers. The Illinois-based group has fought legislation in nine states that would remove sentences of life without parole. Jenkins has experienced the devastation of losing family members to a teen killer. In 1990, her sister and her sister's family, who were living in a wealthy suburb in Chicago, Illinois, were murdered by a teenager. ""Victims have the right not to be constantly revictimized,"" she said. ""They will come back to my community and your community and repeat,"" said Harriet Salerno, president of Crime Victims United of California, a group trying to block the passage of laws that would ease sentencing for juveniles. She founded the victim's group after her daughter, a pre-medical student, was murdered at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California in the 1979. ""Many of them have dysfunctional homes, and the crimes will escalate because there is no place to put them."" Only 19 states punish children under 14 with life sentences without parole, according to a study conducted by the Equal Justice Initiative. Over the past three years, the advocacy group's attorneys have appealed cases involving 13- and 14-year-old offenders in state and federal court. Attorneys argue that the sentences are ""cruel and unusual punishment"" given the tender years of the offenders. Read the center's report . Last week, the state of Missouri dismissed Quantel Lotts' case in St. Francois County Circuit Court. The Equal Justice Initiative will challenge the decision in the Missouri Court of Appeals. A separate petition, filed in 2007, is pending in federal court in the Eastern District of Missouri. Lotts remains in prison in Bonne Terre, Missouri, and he is hopeful. He has new dreams of going to college and maybe even becoming a lawyer. ""My family motivates me,"" he explained. ""Because I want to be out there with them so I can never give up."" He wishes he could start over, but not at the beginning. He grew up in a crack house with a mother who used and sold drugs. In Lotts' case, court documents reveal that he was sexually abused as a child. When child welfare officials took Lotts from his mother at the age of 8, they noted that he ""smelled of urine and had badly decayed molars as well as numerous scars on his arms, legs and forehead."" ""Quantel had a lot of anger because of all he has been through,"" said stepmother Tammy Lotts, 45, whose son Michael Barton was Lotts' victim. iReport.com: Sentence 'totally unfair' At the time of the crime, Tammy Lotts said she left her children for several days with her husband to get high on crack cocaine. ""But I don't believe that Quantel did it,"" she added. ""They took care of each other. They didn't see each other as stepbrothers; they considered them brothers."" Most young offenders serving life without parole were exposed to poverty, violence or drugs during childhood, the Equal Justice Initiative reported. Some victims' families say that's exactly why the juveniles should stay locked up. Salerno, of Crime Victims United of California, said that some juveniles can be rehabilitated but that some committed crimes so severe, resources shouldn't be wasted on them. Two cases in which juvenile offenders got life without parole didn't even involve murder. Antonio Nunez was 14 years old when he committed a crime that gave him life without parole. The crime was an armed kidnapping that occurred in 2001. He spent his childhood in a gang-ridden neighborhood in South Central Los Angeles, California. He was shot in the stomach multiple times while riding his bike at age 13.  See stories of other inmates who were sentenced to life in prison without parole » . In Florida, Joe Sullivan, who case will be heard soon by the U.S. Supreme Court, was sentenced to life without parole for 1989 rape of an elderly woman. He was 13 at the time of the crime and is mentally disabled. In 2005, groups that opposed life sentences without parole for young people, began to gain traction after the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds in the landmark case Roper v. Simmons. A year later, Colorado abolished life without parole for minors who commit crimes. At the federal level, Rep. Robert C. Scott, D-Virginia, will introduce legislation this year to give youthful offenders the option of parole. In California, Democratic Sen. Leland Yee has proposed a law that grants young offenders a chance at parole after ten years. ""Children aren't just little adults, and it's starting to resonate with people,"" said Ashley Nellis, an analyst at the Sentencing Project, a research organization tracking sentencing patterns. ""There has been a general momentum of changing juvenile law in the last few years."" Nearly a decade later, Lotts, now a grown man, still cries himself to sleep over the loss of his stepbrother. To ease the pain, he reads novels or listens to the tunes of R&B group Dru Hill. One sleepless night in prison, Lotts found himself reading the book ""Lightning"" by Dean Koontz. The novel, about time travel, has become one of his favorites. He often thinks about what it would be like to turn back time. ""This would have never happened,"" he said. ""My brother would be here today.""","At least 73 inmates serve life without parole for offenses committed at 13 and 14 .

"Garcia, Mexico (CNN)   -- Officials in a northern Mexican city plagued by violence say a new course will take a fresh approach toward protecting citizens: Training people to handle and shoot guns. The aim of the approach, says Garcia Mayor Jaime Rodriguez Calderon, is putting a stop to crime in the 40,000-person city in Nuevo Leon state. ""Many people call me because their son or their husband has been kidnapped, or some family member's car has been stolen. I said to myself, 'Wow, how can we, the citizens, defend ourselves,' "" Rodriguez told CNNMexico.com. Twice this year, gunmen have tried to assassinate Rodriguez, who has earned the nickname of Bronco for his strong personality. The training for people with weapons permits in Garcia is part of a phase of Rodriguez's security program aimed at ""involving the citizens in defense of the region."" ""Many of them want the training and knowledge ... to defend their families and their heritage,"" he said. In addition to the weapons course, the project also includes broader training in its ""urban defense"" goals. ""Imagine if there is someone wounded and no one in the neighborhood knows what to do. It's happened to us that in the street there is someone who's been shot and the (paramedics) don't come,"" Rodriguez said. So far, about 3,000 people from Garcia and nearby cities have signed up for the course, including engineers, teachers, housewives and retired military. The course's start date has not yet been scheduled. It will be free and take place in a city hunting club, where students will use .22-caliber guns for training. Garcia's program is not the first citizen-defense proposal in Nuevo Leon state involving weapons. State lawmakers are also studying a proposal that would relax weapons restrictions there. Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas, has seen a surge in violence as the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas drug gang fight over drug trafficking routes.","Garcia mayor: Many citizens want training ""to defend their families""

"(CNN)  -- A journalist who was interviewing a key political protest leader in Bangkok said the sniper bullet that struck the man came so close that it ""felt like it grazed my head."" Describing a chaotic scene on the streets of the Thai capital Thursday night, Thomas Fuller of the International Herald Tribune described to CNN how Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol was shot in the head as he was interviewing the opposition figure. ""I was facing him, he was answering my questions, looking at me and the bullet hit him in the forehead, from what I could tell,"" Fuller told CNN's Michael Holmes. ""It looks like the bullet came over my head and struck him. I don't have any way of confirming this beyond what I remember from the scene, but it felt like it grazed my head."" Thomas Fuller describes scene in Bangkok . Fuller and other journalists were interviewing the general -- better known as Seh Daeng -- in makeshift barricades that protesters have set up in downtown Bangkok. The United Front for Democracy (UDD) has turned the posh commercial center of Bangkok into a makeshift fortress, as they continue to demand that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. The protesters' barricades appear as a combination ""of 'Mad Max' and some medieval scene,"" Fuller said. Bamboo pikes and rubber tire barricades have been formed as a makeshift camp by the protesters, Fuller said. iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . Fuller said he was just inside the barricades when he was interviewing Seh Daeng. The opposition figure was facing out of the barricades and into Bangkok's business district of tall office buildings. ""He was standing in the same location for a while when I was talking to him but he was moving around, he was gesticulating,"" Fuller said. ""He wasn't standing still, he was bobbing his head."" Seh Daeng did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat, Fuller said. The opposition leader was listed in critical condition from the shooting, his guards said. Violence erupted after Thai authorities set a new deadline to seal off the Bangkok intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month. Escalating violence in Bangkok . The government said it has been forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by Abhisit to vacate the intersection by Wednesday. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. What are the protests about? Seh Daeng -- or Red Commander -- is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said. Some Thai opposition leaders see him as an impediment to a peaceful resolution to the political stalemate that has gripped Thai politics, Fuller said. ""He's a renegade in all sense,"" Fuller said. ""He's a renegade from the army, a hardliner within the protest movement. He told me today he thought they (other opposition leaders) were being cowardly, and he wanted to carry on.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A television station in Hong Kong has been fined for airing a report in July that suggested former Chinese President Jiang Zemin had died, regulators said Tuesday. Asia Television Limited (ATV) was fined almost $39,000 for the inaccurate report and its ""irresponsible approach"" to the subsequent inquiry, the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority said in its report on the incident. Rumors of Jiang's demise began when he failed to attend the 90th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Speculation intensified on Chinese micro-blogging networks, prompting state media to publicly dismiss the reports as ""pure rumor."" But ATV continued to report the rumor in several bulletins on July 6 before it finally retracted the story later in the day. Death rumors spur reflections on Jiang legacy . According to a report in the South China Morning Post, ATV senior vice-president Kwong Hoi-ying repeatedly pressed the station's news department to run the report, telling them he had received reliable information about Jiang's death. It said the news desk tried unsuccessfully to verify the information and asked for more time, but Kwong insisted they broadcast the report, saying he and ATV would shoulder the responsibility. ""Having considered the information collected at the interviews and all other available evidence and submissions, the BA has found the complaints against inaccurate news reporting and late correction of factual errors substantiated,"" the Broadcasting Authority said in the report. ""The BA regrets that ATV has adopted an irresponsible approach in its response to BA's inquiry. The BA has decided that a financial penalty of HK$300,000 should be imposed on ATV."" The broadcaster accepted the decision. ""ATV accepts the Broadcasting Authority's ruling, but reserves agreement on some of the points outlined by the Authority,"" the station said in a statement received by CNN Tuesday. ""ATV will learn from this incident and continue to uphold journalistic standards going forward."" During his 13 years as general secretary of the Communist Party and nearly 10 years as president, Jiang mixed economic freedom and political control to move forward the so-called ""market socialism"" introduced by his predecessor Deng Xiaoping. Under his leadership, China began to emerge as the world's fastest growing major economy. Jiang also saw the peaceful handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China and that of Macau from Portugal, while repeatedly threatening to use military power against Taiwan if it declared independence.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama hopes embattled New York congressman Charlie Rangel can end his career with dignity. ""I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well. But these allegations are very troubling,"" Obama said on Friday in an interview with CBS News' Harry Smith. ""He's somebody who's at the end of his career. Eighty years old. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity. And my hope is that it happens."" Obama added. Obama commented Friday just hours after a subcommittee of the House ethics committee recommended that the Harlem Democrat be reprimanded. A reprimand would be a relatively light punishment, compared with censure and expulsion. The recommendation was made to the ethics committee before Thursday's public hearing detailing charges against Rangel. The full committee and the House would have to approve any sanction against Rangel. Asked about the recommendation, Rangel initially told CNN on Friday that it's ""untrue."" Rangel's attorney, however, later said that the embattled congressman ""misspoke"" and the possibility of a reprimand ""was one of a number of issues addressed in settlement discussions."" The full committee has accused Rangel of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress. Among other things, Rangel has been charged with using his influence to solicit donations for a college policy center bearing his name from corporate heads and others with business before the powerful House Ways and Means Committee that Rangel chaired until forced to give up the leadership position earlier this year. Other charges involve alleged income tax and financial disclosure violations, as well as improper use of government mail service and letterhead. An ethics committee trial of Rangel is still set to be held, most likely in September, barring a settlement between Rangel and the committee members.","Obama said he hopes that U.S. Rep.

"Editor's note: Mark Preston is the political editor for CNN. Mark Preston says Obama came out ahead in the honorary degree flap with scholarship named after him. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Keep the honorary degree -- I'd take the scholarship program. Arizona State University's refusal last week to present an honorary degree to President Obama cast an unnecessary dark cloud over the school and forced officials to do something they apparently were trying to avoid: recognize the president for his accomplishments. Instead of giving him a piece of paper, the school now has named its ""most important scholarship program"" after him -- and the controversy still hasn't gone away. Initially a university spokesperson told The Associated Press, ""His body of work is yet to come. That's why we're not recognizing him with a degree at the beginning of his presidency."" That is true -- we do not yet know what Obama will accomplish as the 44th president of the United States. But ASU's own guidelines state that a degree is given to those who have made ""significant contributions to education and society over the course of a person's career."" Now, you might not have voted for Obama, and perhaps you don't agree with his policies, but he was a U.S. senator, a community organizer, and a lecturer on constitutional law. And isn't Obama's election as the first African-American president a ""significant"" achievement in this country? Arizona Sen. John McCain -- Obama's opponent in the 2008 election -- noted the historic significance of Obama's victory in his election night concession speech. So what would stop the ASU elders from doing so? After all, Sen. Barry Goldwater was awarded a degree after serving one term in the Senate, while Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had been on the Court for three years before receiving her honorary degree. Legendary broadcaster Walter Cronkite and labor activist Cesar Chavez were also awarded honorary degrees. ASU President Michael Crow said the school had always intended to honor the president, but hadn't decided how to do so. We do know that ASU had decided how not to recognize Obama: with an honorary degree. As pressure built up over the past week, ASU needed to move fast to try and push that dark cloud off of the university. ASU's solution was unveiled over the weekend: Name a scholarship program after Obama. ""Naming this scholarship program after President Obama that will affect the lives of thousands of students is an honor befitting, not only the president's exceptional achievements, but also his values as an individual,"" Crow said in a statement released by the school. ""The President Barack Obama Scholars program will be a legacy that will endure and inspire others for generations to come."" An honorary degree or a named scholarship program? I would take the scholarship program. ""We hope that the recent discussion of honorary degrees will not detract from the honor and thrill that ASU -- and indeed all of Arizona -- is experiencing in anticipation of his visit,"" Crow said in the statement. ""I am honored, as are our faculty, staff and students, that President Obama will give his first commencement speech as president of the United States at ASU."" Crow need not worry. I doubt that most Americans will look down upon the students and faculty for ASU's bewildering decision not to grant Obama an honorary degree. I acknowledge, at first blush I really didn't think this was a big deal. So what if Obama wasn't presented with an honorary degree? Then I came to my senses. Isn't it simply common sense and common courtesy to present the president of the United States with an honorary degree -- especially if you invite him to participate in your commencement ceremony? There still is time for the university to reverse its decision and present him with that piece of paper. But even if ASU chooses not to do so, I still think the president comes out on top by having the ""most important scholarship program"" named in his honor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Preston.","Mark Preston: Arizona State University decided not to give Obama an honorary degree .

"Washington (CNN) -- A mission to evacuate Americans from South Sudan was aborted Saturday when an aircraft carrying U.S. military members was fired upon as it prepared to land in Bor, wounding four of them, the Pentagon said. The most severely damaged aircraft was thought to have been hit in the fuel line, a military official speaking on condition of anonymity said. All three aircraft -- CV-22 Ospreys -- were diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, which is not where their flights originated, the official said. Another aircraft then flew the wounded to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement. The four service members were in stable condition after treatment, the statement said. Pentagon officials were trying to determine how to mount another effort to evacuate the roughly three dozen Americans in South Sudan, where they have been working for the United Nations, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was ""reviewing options,"" Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""Whatever we do it will be in coordination with the State Department,"" he added. The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed before dawn Saturday while aboard Air Force One after landing in Hawaii, then met with his national security team on the matter. The fighting has displaced as many as 100,000 people, many of whom have crossed the Nile River, he said, adding that he feared a humanitarian disaster was unfolding. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting this month's violence. Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. Casualties include soldiers and number in the hundreds, the government said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Kiir on Saturday and discussed ways to halt the violence. It was Kerry's second call to Kiir since Thursday night. ""Secretary Kerry emphasized that only through leadership and political dialogue will the challenges facing South Sudan be resolved,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. The two men ""discussed the need to prevent ethnic violence, their concern for the welfare of thousands of internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict, as well as for the safety of U.S. citizens in South Sudan, and they agreed to speak again soon,"" she said. Meanwhile, the State Department issued an emergency message for U.S. citizens, calling on them to avoid the area around the airport in Bor. Limited flights were continuing from Juba International Airport. On Friday, Kerry said he was sending a special envoy -- Ambassador Donald Booth -- to the country. ""Now is the time for South Sudan's leaders to rein in armed groups under their control, immediately cease attacks on civilians, and end the chain of retributive violence between different ethnic and political groups,"" Kerry said in a statement. Saturday's violence wasn't the first this week to harm foreign troops in South Sudan. On Thursday, attackers killed two Indian army peacekeepers, wounded a third, and killed 20 of 30 civilians who were seeking refuge at the United Nations' Akobo base, the U.N. said. In a news release, the African Union called for an immediate truce. It said that the chairwoman of the AU Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was ""profoundly dismayed at the recent turn of events"" and condemned the killing of innocent civilians and U.N. peacekeepers in Bor as a war crime. South Sudan became the world's newest country when it split from Sudan in July 2011. The split happened after a 2005 peace agreement ended years of civil war between the largely Animist and Christian south and the Muslim-dominated north. The deal led to a January 2011 referendum in which people of the south voted to secede from Sudan. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau, Jason Hanna, Adam Aigner-Treworgy, Mading Ngor, Marie-Louise Gumuchian, Zain Verjee and Clare Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: African Union calls for an immediate truce .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- An Italian woman who had been in a coma for 17 years and whose right-to-die case was being debated in the Italian Parliament has died days after doctors began removing her feeding tube. A portrait of Eluana Englaro. She was in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years. The speaker of the Italian Senate announced the death of Eluana Englaro, 37, Monday night, then called for a moment of silence in the chamber. Even as the silence ended, one legislator declared, ""She has not died -- she was killed,"" prompting other right-to-die opponents to join in with calls of ""Murderers!"" Englaro had been in a vegetative state for 17 years, after suffering what doctors determined to be irreversible brain damage in a 1992 car crash, when she was 20 years old. For years, Englaro's father, Beppino, fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state. Confirming his daughter's death Monday, Beppino Englaro told Italian media: ""Yes, she is no longer with us, but I don't want to say anything further. I need to be left alone."" But the intense debate swirling around her case will go on.  Watch as Italians protest against her death » . When Englaro's death was announced, the Senate was debating a proposed law that would require doctors to provide nourishment to all incapacitated patients, and that would have forced doctors to resume feeding Englaro through tubes. Debate on that proposal as it would affect other patients is likely to continue in Parliament. Last year, a court ruled that the feeding tube could be removed, and Italy's high court upheld the ruling on appeal. Englaro was transferred last week to a private clinic, where the removal process began Friday -- even as the Senate took up a debate aimed at reversing that process. A decree aimed at preventing doctors from completely removing the feeding tube was passed unanimously Friday by Italy's Council of Ministers, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi leading the effort. ""I will do everything I can to save her life,"" Berlusconi said. ""We have to do everything possible to stop a person from dying."" But President Giorgio Napolitano refused to sign the decree. According to a statement from Napolitano's office, ""An emergency decree cannot be in contrast with a court decision."" The case has been a controversial one in Italy, a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence. Earlier this month, Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that ""euthanasia is a false solution to suffering."" Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said Friday that Englaro had the right to be kept alive. ""It is the duty of the doctors, of society, and of the political institutions to administer her essential foods to keep her alive. No one has the right to take her life away from her,"" he said. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, but patients have the right to refuse treatment. It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because some time before her accident she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said.","NEW: Woman in coma for 17 years in Italy has died, her father says .

"(CNN) -- Slavery is the most abhorrent chapter in America's history. Everyone knows it happened, but few people know much about it or want to think about it. Which means that it's not exactly something that pops up with regularity in popular entertainment--even though slavery's legacy, 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, is still very much with us. This makes the release of ""12 Years A Slave"" something of a major historical-cultural event. The film, which opens Friday with an A-list cast--Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt--is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a free black man kidnapped in 1841 in Washington and sold into slavery in New Orleans. Uncompromising and extremely violent, ""12 Years"" refuses to downplay the racism, brutality and crude Darwinian mindset that typified the ""peculiar institution."" This is not ""Django Unchained,"" which was a blend of spaghetti Western, Blaxploitation flick and whatever else popped into Quentin Tarantino's genre-fevered brain. And it's not last year's ""Lincoln,"" a film that was about emancipation but was so genteel in its approach, it skipped the part about plantation culture. 'The Butler' reflects America's racial conversations . ""12 Years a Slave"" is easily the most hard-hitting portrayal of slavery since the 1977 TV blockbuster ""Roots."" It is the kind of film that many people will avoid, in part because of its depiction of everything from the surrealism of slave markets to whippings, rapes, hangings and the myriad ways in which slave owners terrorized and ruled over their property. It's also a movie that Americans need to see, if they are to better understand their country. It's an uncomfortable reminder that the legacy of this once deeply rooted institution continues to resonate in our society, whether it is the current fight over voter ID laws in states like Texas and North Carolina that disproportionately affect minorities; the fact that the African-American incarceration rate, fueled by years of poverty and racism, is six times the national average, and the unemployment rate for blacks is double that of whites; or the continued high rate of out-of-wedlock births among contemporary black women. A country that refuses to confront its past is a country in denial. ""12 Years A Slave"" startles the viewer like a slap in the face, and the film is even more astonishing since it is the work of Steve McQueen, a black British director who said during a press conference at the Toronto International Film Festival that he was particularly interested in the subject because it ""is about how to survive an unfortunate situation."" Yet he also admitted that ""I made this movie because I want to tell a story about slavery and a story that hasn't been given a platform in cinema. ... If that starts a conversation, wonderful."" That conversation has long been virtually ignored by the mass media, which has treated the subject of slavery as if it were the bastard child of American history rather than an original sin that must be faced. For most of the last century, movies and TV in the pre-Civil Rights era, always sensitive to race issues and how they might affect box office in the Southern states, either ignored slavery or sugar-coated it. Films like ""Gone With the Wind,"" for example, glamorized the antebellum South. The harsh realities of field work were almost never shown, most slave owners were benevolent, and slaves, most of whom tended to work in the big house, were basically ordinary servants (who could be bought and sold at will and worked without pay, of course), devoted to their masters. When that story wasn't enough, the most lurid aspects of the slave trade were front and center -- in particular, interracial sex between slave and master, depicted in films like ""Mandingo,"" ""Drum"" and 1957's ""Band of Angels,"" in which good-guy slave master Clark Gable buys beautiful mulatto Yvonne De Carlo and then falls in love with her. Needless to say, none of these films bothered to fully explore the political and power dynamics involved. Must-see African movies of the 21st century . ""Roots"" helped changed the narrative. The massively popular miniseries followed the slave Kunta Kinte (played by LeVar Burton) from his African home to the Middle Passage, a Maryland slave auction and plantation life in Virginia. It featured an aborted slave revolt, whippings, torture, rape and other horrors. But despite Roots' enormous audience (the final episode was watched by 100 million people) the subject of slavery did not return soon. When filmmakers did try to address it, they were met with indifference - films like ""Amistad,"" ""Beloved"" and ""Glory"" drew critical praise but failed to gain much traction at the box office. Will ""12 Years A Slave"" change all that? Already critically praised and the winner of the People's Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival, the film is being touted as a serious Oscar contender. Yet whether moviegoers beyond the art house crowd will continue to duck McQueen's ""conversation"" and this lesson in American depravity is another matter altogether. ""12 Years A Slave"" tells us how we got to where we are today racially. It is not a story that Confederate flag wavers, states' rights advocates, talk radio stalwarts and all too many other Americans want to entertain. I can just hear them saying ""Slavery ended 150 years ago. Get over it."" It did, and it didn't. And that's the point. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lewis Beale.","Lewis Beale: Slavery a stain on America, but few people want to know much about it .

"Beijing (CNN) -- ""Across the Great Wall we can reach every corner of the world,"" read the header of the first email sent from China back in 1987. Two Chinese scientists sent it to their German counterparts through an ""email node,"" a rudimentary system used to send emails at that time. Their hyperbole aside, they probably didn't realize that the rare connection could foretell a digital revolution. That came on April 20, 1994, when geeks at the Institute of High Energy Physics at China's Academy of Sciences built the first cable connection to the World Wide Web via facilities based at Stanford University's Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). This year marks the 20th anniversary of China's first connection with the Internet -- a technological breakthrough that has had a particularly massive impact on the world's most populous country. ""It's been utterly transformational,"" said Kaiser Kuo, director of international communications at Baidu, China's largest search engine. ""The advent of the Internet has been a great leveler in terms of access to knowledge, to education materials, to goods and services. ""A school teacher in a rural mountain village with just an Internet connection has access to the same teaching material as her counterpart teaching in the best school in Beijing. A consumer in a hinterland country town can buy the very latest in consumer electronics, or books or fashion just the same as someone in Shanghai. And practically anyone anywhere can set up a virtual store to reach a nationwide market."" The boom years . Two decades ago, China's digital starting point was low and slow: only around 2,000 Chinese computers had access to the Internet. Connection was by telephone lines through a modem. ""It was super slow and very expensive,"" remembered Zhao Wei, a college graduate then and now a top executive of a local Internet company. By 1996, the first Internet cafes opened in Shanghai and other major cities, enabling more and more people to access the Net even before they bought computers. The first generation of Internet users quickly emerged when local companies such as Sina, Sohu and Netease opened for business. Internet connectivity has since shifted gears with one technological leap to another, from telephone lines to optic fibers and now wireless. China is advancing to the 4G era, with more and more people using smartphones. In 2008, China's Internet users reached 298 million, surpassing the United States as the world's biggest Internet population. At the end of last year, that grew to 618 million, about half of China's entire population. A global player . Internet connectivity is changing the lives, lifestyle and consumer behavior of many ordinary Chinese. Nowadays, typical urbanites begin their day turning on their computers, tablets and smartphones to check their emails or get on social media platforms. More than half of Chinese Internet users communicate and share information via social networks such as Weibo, QQ and WeChat. Thanks to the thriving IT industry, hundreds of thousands of people have started private businesses. Some of them have emerged as major players in the global IT industry and are among the richest entrepreneurs in China. E-commerce offers nearly two million direct jobs and over 13 million indirect ones domestically. China also hosts one of the world's leading e-trade businesses called Alibaba that, based on gross trade, is already bigger than eBay and Amazon combined. 'Great Firewall' still limits . To be sure, Internet in China is not totally without borders. A sophisticated system enables Chinese ""Internet police"" to filter or delete online content that authorities dislike. China's critics dubbed it the ""Great Firewall of China."" ""The (Communist) Party devotes huge resources to ensuring that the Internet does not threaten their rule,"" said Jeremy Goldkorn, Director of Danwei, a China-focused blog and media research firm. ""So far, they have been successful."" State media reported last year that China employs around two million people to police public opinion online, while popular social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter remain blocked in China. Even so, Goldkorn said the Internet has changed the Chinese government's behavior for the better. ""The Internet has made the government more responsive to the needs of its citizens and made it nearly impossible to cover up bad news of a major nature,"" he explained. Converging worlds . While China has built its thriving IT industry on the advanced Internet technology and business models found in the United States and other countries, analysts also credit the Chinese for their distinctive innovations. Popular social media platforms such as WeChat and Sina Weibo are actually better than their Western counterparts, Whatsapp and Twitter, some industry analysts say. Multi-screen convergence, for example, has developed swiftly in China because there are more users surfing the Internet using smartphone devices rather than a laptop. This has pushed Chinese Internet giants such as Youku to work with TV stations and traditional media even before Hulu did in the U.S. As early as 2009, Tudou had developed its own original content before Netflix started doing the same, according to Victor Koo, CEO of Youku Tudou Inc, who was speaking at the ""China 2.0"" event held earlier this month at the Peking University Stanford Center. The rapid spread of mobile connectivity is also prompting the convergence of online and offline industries. Youku Tudou Inc has been co-producing online shorts and feature film with leading Chinese film distributors such as BONA. In the future, analysts foresee further Internet penetration and convergence. ""You can get a smartphone that can access the Internet for under US$100,"" predicted Goldkorn. ""Very soon, the entire literate population of China will be able to get online. It's going to change everything from business to government to the way people find a spouse, buy real estate, and invest their savings.""","April 20, 2014 marked the 20th anniversary of the Chinese Internet .

"(CNN) -- A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast after Tropical Storm Karen formed in the southeastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. Track the storm . The watch covers the area from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to west of Destin, Florida. The center of the storm is forecast to be near the coast within that area Saturday. A tropical storm warning is in effect from Grand Isle to the mouth of the Pearl River. ""Karen is expected to be at or near hurricane strength late Friday and early Saturday,"" read a hurricane center advisory. The storm, which as of Thursday evening was about 360 miles south of the Mississippi River's mouth, prompted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to recall some of its workers, furloughed during the government shutdown. The agency also reactivated its Hurricane Liaison Team at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. FEMA officials in the Atlanta and Denton, Texas, offices are monitoring Karen. ""At all times, FEMA maintains commodities, including millions of liters of water, millions of meals and hundreds of thousands of blankets, strategically located at distribution centers throughout the United States, including in the Gulf Coast region, that are available to state and local partners if needed and requested,"" the agency said in a statement. The hurricane center said it, too, would be unaffected by the government shutdown as Karen approaches. ""The National Hurricane Center is fully operational ... and has all of its resources available to it,"" spokesman Dennis Feltgen said in an e-mail. ""The government shutdown will not inhibit NHC from providing its mission."" A tropical storm watch was in effect from west of Grand Isle to east of Morgan City, Louisiana, an area that includes metropolitan New Orleans, Lake Maurepas and Lake Ponchartrain.

"(CNN) -- NASA scaled back operations on the International Space Station on Wednesday after discovering a problem with a cooling system. A pump on one of the station's two external cooling loops shut down after hitting a temperature limit, NASA said. Teams worked to get the cooling loop back up and running, NASA said. Experts suspect a malfunctioning valve may have caused the problem, but they're still trying to figure out how to fix it. The station and crew aboard were never in any danger, NASA said. Officials could determine that an emergency spacewalk is the best way to fix the failed pump -- something they've done in the past. NASA said Thursday that there has been no decision on the spacewalk, and it may be a couple of days before the decision is made, according to Kenny Todd, the ISS mission management team chairman. The external cooling loops are systems that circulate ammonia outside the station to keep equipment cool. International Space Station Fast Facts . Officials discovered the malfunctioning loop was producing too much ammonia Wednesday morning, NASA spokesman Josh Byerly said. Teams have shut down some noncritical systems on the station as a result of the problem, NASA said. The space station's life support system is still up and running. The current mission of the space station, officially called Expedition 38, is scheduled to go until March 2014.

"Editor's note: This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles CNN is doing about economic survival in this time of financial crisis. Tony and Lynette Lorenz pose, in more financially secure times, for a picture the night before their 2004 wedding. (CNN) -- Ever since her hometown of Fort Myers, Florida, earned the distinction of having the highest rate of foreclosures in the country, Lynette Lorenz has spent the bulk of a year away -- 1,200 miles away -- from her home and her husband. The 42-year-old automotive service provider, a commission-only position that helps car buyers with maintenance needs, once raked in $95,000 a year. But as the recession rolled into Fort Myers, the jobs, including hers, dried up. Now unemployment in Fort Myers is near double-digits. Lorenz became depressed and the tension between her and her husband, who works in the same industry, soared, sometimes forcing her to retreat to the spare bedroom. ""I was miserable,"" she said. ""I'm not the kind of person who can sit around the house all day.""  iReport.com: Tell us how you're surviving . So in March 2008 she up and left, heading north to Maryland, where a friend said the automotive jobs were plenty. It was an extreme measure, but it was one she felt she had to take during these hard times, both for personal and financial reasons. Within one week, she landed at a Nissan dealership in Timonium, north of Baltimore. Homesickness drove her back to Florida in July, where she found the Fort Myers economy in even worse shape and jobs even tougher to come by. The city's continued struggles even prompted a visit from President Barack Obama earlier this week. Depression, tension with her husband, and a general lack of purpose returned full throttle. In November, with only $50 in her pocket, she returned to Timonium and managed to get her job back. Lorenz says she now works 10 times as hard to make half her former income. She paid $250 in cash for a 1991 Nissan and moved into a utilities-included apartment, where she slept at first on an air-mattress with borrowed sheets. She combed through the free furniture listings on Craigslist, and scoured Goodwill and cheaper outlets for good deals. She found a couch and chair for $25, and artwork for $7. ""You have to be at the bottom to find out what your strengths are,"" she says of her resourcefulness. ""Pure determination got me here, and I'm really proud of it, too."" iReport.com: 1,200 miles apart and surviving . It hasn't always been this way for Lorenz, who said she used to be a ""country club girl."" There was a time when she spent money as if her financial well had no bottom. She said she bought new homes when she became bored with the old, and bought Versace and Chanel at fancy department stores such as Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue, often on credit. Her turnaround began in November 2004, when -- with debt amounting to about $50,000, Lorenz said -- she appeared on ""Dr. Phil."" The episode title was ""Where'd the Money Go?"" Flanked by two of her three daughters, including her then-15 year old who counted 100 pairs of shoes in her own closet, Lorenz got a televised dose of reality from the mustachioed host. ""He made a statement that stuck with me ... 'You define yourself by what you have, not who you are,' "" said Lorenz. ""I'd never looked at my life that way before."" Watching the program later made her think, and says Lorenzo, ""The spending stopped."" Good thing it did, because the hard times ahead would require it. She says she has learned to appreciate what she has and scoffs at her one-time need for high-end labels. Tossing her once-coveted $500 Chanel sunglasses on the counter, she laughs and says, ""These suckers don't even stop the sun from coming in my eyes."" Lorenz laughs easily and often, but her situation is fraught with challenges. She is, after all, 1,200 miles away from her husband, Tony, 38, whom she married in 2004. But the couple generally talks daily, and occasional visits help sustain them, even if parting is difficult, says Lorenz. ""Every day you wish you had a job [in the same city] with each other, but unfortunately that's just not the way it happened,"" she said. ""He [Tony] never wanted me to leave, but ... I know we will be together again."" Tony, reached in Fort Myers, said being separated from his ""strong-willed"" wife can be difficult. ""I want her to come home for selfish reasons -- because I want to spend the rest of my life with her. ... But I don't want her to feel or get depressed because she's not working,"" he said. ""It's probably a lesson for us. We argued. We worked against each other. We weren't sure of our appreciation for one another until we weren't together."" Turns out they may be back together sooner than they thought. Nissan announced Monday that it would be slashing 20,000 jobs. Lorenz won't know until February 24 if she'll be laid off, but, she says, she won't let the possibility get her down. ""If one door closes, another one will open,"" she said. ""If it comes to an end here, that's God telling me, 'It's time to go home and be with your husband.' "" She said she doesn't worry about a return to depression if she does go home. The time away has ""made me a stronger person,"" she said. ""I'm in a different place ... I have seen so much since March of last year ... and have met so many people who are so desolate,"" she said. ""I still have my family, still have my husband, and that's enough for me."" And if need be, she said she's no longer above working outside her field. ""I'll sell minnows at the beach. Everyone needs minnows to fish with,"" she said with a laugh. ""I may have to go outside that comfort zone, but I'm fine with it.""","Automotive worker leaves Fort Myers, Florida, depression and husband for a job .

"(CNN) -- It was the moment the world had been waiting for, and as he has so often in his glittering career, Lionel Messi delivered. After a frantic opening to the World Cup in Brazil with entertainment and goals aplenty, one of its gold-plated stars announced his arrival in style. A trademark slaloming run from the Barcelona striker ended in the fashion soccer fans have become well accustomed to -- with the net rippling. In truth, Argentina were far from their best against the World Cup debutantes Bosnia and Herzegovina despite going 1-0 up thanks to the quickest goal at the World Cup to date. Sead Kolasinac was the unwitting scorer, diverting the ball into his own net after a Messi free kick was glanced on by Marcos Rojo. Alejandro Sabella's men couldn't build on that early lead though as Bosnia and Herzegovina held their own until the interval. Argentina's lead was doubled on 65 minutes thanks to a piece of magic from their talisman. Messi swapped passes with Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n and sidestepped two challenges before firing home off the inside of the post via a slight deflection. His vigorous celebration perhaps showed the pressure he was under to perform, as the endless comparisons to Argentina's other world famous player -- Diego Maradona -- go on. A goal from substitute Vedad Ibisevic ensured a nervy final six minutes but Argentina held out to secure three important points. France 3-0 Honduras . The first World Cup goal to be awarded via goal-line technology helped France to a convincing 3-0 victory over 10-man Honduras in Porto Alegre. Karim Benzema, who had put France ahead thanks to a first half penalty, fired a shot against the post only for Honduras keeper Noel Valladares to inadvertently nudge the ball towards goal. It was awarded by the referee after goal-line technology -- introduced for the first time at this World Cup by FIFA -- instructed him the ball had crossed the line. Replays inside the stadium led to boos from some supporters, as the big screen flashed up 'no goal' for the initial effort that hit the upright, then 'goal' after the ball had cannoned off Valladares. Aside from the confusion it was a routine win for an energetic France side, whose task was made easier when Honduras went down to 10 men. Wilson Palacios, who plays for English Premier League side Stoke, had already been booked when he barged into Paul Pogba, conceding a penalty and attracting a second booking. Benzema duly dispatched the spot kick as France seized the initiative just before the interval. Then just three minutes after the break came a landmark moment for the world game when Benzema's volley from an exquisite Yohan Cabaye pass flashed back off the post. Valladares tried to parry the ball clear as it hurtled towards him but only succeeded in flicking it over the line, the referee confirming the goal a few seconds later. Honduras protested and the replays led to confusion but the goal was awarded, four years after the incident in South Africa that led FIFA president Sepp Blatter to change his mind on technology. A shot from England's Frank Lampard flicked off the bar and bounced down a yard over the line in their quarterfinal with Germany but the goal wasn't awarded. There was no doubt about Benzema's second, as he fired emphatically into the roof of the net after pouncing on a loose ball, completing a perfect opening night for France coach Didier Deschamps. Switzerland 2-1 Ecuador . The other game in Group E on Sunday was a tale of two super subs for Switzerland as an injury time winner from Haris Seferovic broke Ecuadorian hearts in Brasilia. The striker came off the bench to pounce in the dying seconds of the game after another sub -- Admir Mehmedi -- had canceled out Enner Valencia's early header. It meant that after nine matches at the World Cup, there is still to be a draw. After a low key opening it was Ecuador who struck first, as Enner Valencia planted a firm header into the net from Walter Ayovi's center. Switzerland, tipped by many as World Cup dark horses, struggled to get into any sort of rhythm and squandered a succession of set pieces. But its two-time European Champions League winning coach Ottmar Hitzfeld got his half time tactical tinkering just right and it drew level within minutes of the restart. Hitzfeld brought striker Admir Mehmedi on for Valentin Stocker and the Freiburg forward nodded home from close range. Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio saved well from Jefferson Montero before Josip Drmic had a goal ruled out for offside as the match neared a dramatic conclusion. Ecuador had a great chance to find the net but Michael Arroyo was tackled brilliantly by Valon Behrami, who then launched a counter attack. The referee played an excellent advantage after Behrami was fouled and the move ended with Seferovic finishing off Ricardo Rodriguez's low cross. ""We've done it, and that's unbelievable,"" Hitzfeld was quoted as saying by FIFA's website. ""We never stopped believing in ourselves. I'm extremely happy with the three points and it means it's a good start.""","Lionel Messi announces his World Cup arrival with brilliant goal for Argentina .

"(CNN) -- It was the picture of Jesse Matthew that made the father of slain Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington do a double-take. It was uncanny how much the suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham resembled the police sketch of the man wanted in connection with the kidnapping and sexual assault of a woman in Fairfax, Viriginia, in 2005. Police also linked that suspect to Harrington's case. Could it be the same man? Could it be the man behind the 2009 killing of their 20-year-old daughter, Morgan Harrington? ""I told Gil this person might have been involved in Morgan's murder,"" Dan Harrington told Anderson Cooper Tuesday on CNN's ""AC360."" Harrington's comments came a day after Virginia State Police said there was a ""new forensic link"" between the Graham and Harrington cases. On Tuesday, a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that DNA evidence links Matthew to the death of Harrington. Almost from the beginning, after news of Graham's disappearance, Harrington's parents were struck by the similarities between the two cases. Authorities check unsolved cases for ties to Hannah Graham case . ""Both Hannah's going missing and Morgan's abduction happened about the same time of year,"" Gil Harrington said. It also happened about the same time of night, and with some of the same circumstances, she said. The family of Morgan Harrington searches for answers . Harrington went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her remains, including splintered bones, were found on a farm on the outskirts of the city in late January 2010. The last major development in the Harrington case came in 2010, when her slaying was connected to the kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in Fairfax in 2005. That woman was able to provide police with enough of a description to make a sketch. Police at the time did not identify the woman who provided the description and said only that ""forensic evidence"" linked the two cases. It's that sketch and its similarity to Matthew that is the closest thing the Harrington family says they have to an answer as to who possibly was responsible for killing their daughter. ""You don't get over it,"" Gil Harrington said. ""But I do believe you get past it,"" and you can work to help others, she said. The priority right now, she said, is finding Graham. Graham was last seen September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Hannah Graham disappearance suspect questioned in 2002 alleged rape case . Investigators believe Matthew was the last person with Graham. He has been charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, and he is being held in jail in isolation, according to Charlottesville police. Police investigators have not publicly connected the dots except to say that the arrest of Matthew has given them a break in Harrington's case. Dan Harrington has a message for the man he believes killed his daughter: ""I would like to say how could you take another person's life? How could you possibly be so awful to abduct someone and kill them? ... It's beyond understanding."" Source: DNA in Hannah Graham case links to 2009 death; other cases studied .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- A new restored version of ""Modern Times,"" one of the greatest films in the Hollywood canon, has recently been released. The film, which came out in 1936, vividly captured the anxieties that gripped industrial workers at the height of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, the comedy works as well today as it did over seventy years ago, another sign that all is not well with our economy. In the opening scene, viewers see the Little Tramp, played by Charlie Chaplin, working on an assembly line. Many generations of viewers have laughed as they watched Chaplin try to keep up with the mind-numbing repetition of bolts that must be tightened as they make their way to him on the conveyer belt. Whenever he or his co-workers stop, for even a second, they must frantically scramble to catch up. Chaplin suffers a nervous breakdown and is placed in a hospital. His misfortune continues. When the Little Tramp leaves the hospital, he steps right into the front lines of a communist march. He is mistaken as one of the leaders of the protest. He is arrested and thrown into jail. The Little Tramp eventually escapes during a jail break. Much of the rest of the film follows the Little Tramp and his girlfriend, the Gamine, as they imagine a life of middle-class luxuries. The two break into a department store one night, experiencing what it would be like to enjoy all the new goods that were being offered in the emerging world of mass consumption. In one scene, the Tramp and the Gamine rest by a tree outside a nice neighborhood, watching a couple say goodbye. ""Can you imagine us in a little home like that?"" the caption reads. They think about what it must be like before a policeman tells them to move along. Later, they have a chance to live their dreams, but they must do so in a broken-down shanty where the walls fall over and a wood plank keeps crashing down on Chaplin's head from the ceiling. This is their reality. ""Modern Times"" seems all too familiar for many Americans who are living through an economic nightmare in 2010. Although working conditions for many Americans have vastly improved since the 1930s and citizens can count on certain basic provisions upon their retirement, current economic conditions have created the same kind of despair captured by Chaplin in this film. Other than the upper-income Americans who are enjoying the fruits of a rebounding stock market, most are struggling to survive with an unemployment rate hovering at 9.5 percent (and an underemployment rate, which includes the unemployed and those working part-time seeking full-time work, that is over 19 percent). They are fearful about keeping their jobs if they have one, obtaining jobs if they don't, being able to pay for their family's needs, saving for retirement, and facing local and state governments cutbacks in essential services such as school programs. Yet politicians are not dealing with this crisis and the private sector has not offered solutions. The problem is much deeper than the recession. The stagnant unemployment rates have been produced by a number of forces that have long been brewing in the economy. For decades, businesses have been shifting their plants overseas. They have been setting up shop in places where labor is cheap and unions are nonexistent. While much of this shift began with factory jobs, a growing number of white-collar jobs have left as well. The U.S. has fallen behind in many sectors of the economy such as clean energy and is even starting to feel competition in once-dominant sectors such as science. Public policy, as many scholars have shown, has combined with globalization to undercut the security that many Americans had enjoyed in the post-World War II era, at the same time that income inequality has vastly increased. Rising medical and educational costs have squeezed the financial resources of families as they face these challenges. There will continue to be a debate about which are the most important factors behind the current crisis, but the outcome is indisputable. American workers are struggling. Velma Hart is a poignant example. Hart was the woman who confronted President Obama when she asked, ""I've been told that I voted for a man who said he's going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class ... I'm waiting ... Is this my new reality?"" Unfortunately, Hart found out her answer when she was laid off by a nonprofit organization in Maryland. According to the national director of the organization where she worked, ""It's not anything she did. She got bit by the same snake that has bit a lot of people. It was a move to cut our bottom line. Most not-for-profits are seeing their money pinched."" Too many of the nation's workers are finding themselves right back where Chaplin's character was in 1936. Ultimately, many Americans did experience better lives when the New Deal stabilized conditions and increased government spending in World War II helped stimulate the economy. Innovation and public-private partnerships resulted in a vibrant period for the American economy during the 1950s and 1960s, one that the historian James Patterson has characterized as an era of ""Grand Expectations."" Today the political system seems paralyzed in its efforts to find ways to regenerate the economy. As a new generation of Americans are exposed to the film for the first time, they might find themselves laughing a bit too hard and seeing a little of themselves in Chaplin's shoes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Charlie Chaplin's 1930s film depicted anxiety of workers unable to get ahead .

"Editor's note: Carole Simpson, who anchored the weekend editions of ""ABC World News,"" is leader in residence and a full-time faculty member in the journalism department of Emerson College. A recipient of three national Emmy awards with 40 years experience as a broadcast journalist, Simpson was the first black woman to anchor a network evening news broadcast. Carole Simpson says women are gaining prominence at a time when major network news is endangered. (CNN) -- Diane Sawyer now joins Katie Couric as anchor of a major network evening newscast, leaving Brian Williams the sole man. Since I have personally worked for 30 years for the advancement of women in broadcast journalism, I guess I am supposed to be delighted. Why am I not? Because it took so darned long -- and TV news is on life support. No disrespect to Diane or Katie. I consider them friends and I take pride in their accomplishments. They have proven their talents and journalistic credentials. But, come on. We had to wait until 2009? Women began entering television news in significant numbers in the 1970s during the women's liberation movement. In fact, I started my network career in 1974. The major impact on the hiring of women resulted after 16 women filed a class action sex discrimination suit in federal court against NBC in 1975. Two years later in a $2 million out-of-court settlement, the network promised to act affirmatively and hire, promote and raise the salaries of a large percentage of women over the next five years. CBS and ABC saw the writing on the wall and suddenly discovered many women -- inside and outside their news divisions -- qualified to be more than researchers and secretaries. We women in television news thought we had ""arrived"" when ABC chose Barbara Walters to co-anchor the evening news with Harry Reasoner in 1976. It turned out to be a match made in hell. Harry was so upset about sharing airtime with a woman that he refused to speak to Barbara, except on the news set. The ill-fated experiment ended two years later when Harry left in disgust for CBS and Barbara was ousted as anchor. While newswomen were continuing to move onward and upward in network television, it took another 16 years -- 1993 -- before we saw another woman in a network anchor chair. At CBS Connie Chung was paired with Dan Rather on the ""Evening News."" During her stint as co-anchor, Connie was sent to Oregon to report on figure skater Tonya Harding's activities following an assault on her chief skating rival, Nancy Kerrigan. Dan Rather remained at the anchor desk. Can you even imagine Dan spending days out of the studio reporting on someone like Harding? No, you can't. Chung was axed from the program after two years amid tension with her co-anchor. In 2006, 13 years post-Connie, Katie Couric made history when CBS named her the solo anchor of the ""Evening News."" She had a rough time from the blistering criticism most women ""firsts"" have to endure. But she has held her own and grown in stature, enough so that ABC has given Diane Sawyer her shot. It took almost 40 years for this unique state of affairs. So, why are women getting these opportunities now? Well, I'm a cynic. The reason is that broadcast television news is dying. For more than 20 years, network newscasts have been called ""dinosaurs."" Media experts say the shows are in their death throes. Network news budgets have been slashed and employees have been fired and laid off. The audience for network news has been dwindling year after year as viewers turn to cable or the Internet for their news, or avoid the news altogether. I wish Diane and Katie the best. Millions of Americans still watch network news programs, but they are only a semblance of what they were in terms of quality and content. With fewer resources and the death knell sounding, why not put women in charge of the network evening news programs? When things couldn't be worse, it's okay for women to be in charge.

"(CNN) -- What can a pod of dolphins teach golfers? Quite a lot according to Paul Azinger, the last man to captain the United States to victory in the Ryder Cup, back in 2008. Another humbling at the hands of Europe, who completed a third straight victory in the biennial team tussle at Gleneagles last month, provoked a familiar wave of American introspection. Surprisingly, it was sparked by one of its own team members -- five-time major winner Phil Mickelson -- who launched an astonishing critique of the job done by 2014 skipper Tom Watson. The 44-year-old lauded Azinger's leadership during the 2008 tournament at a tense press conference at Gleneagles, hours after Europe's 16½-11½ success had been confirmed. Mickelson said Azinger had involved the players in his decision making process and formulated a ""real game plan,"" the implication being that Watson had done neither during his tenure. The 64-year-old veteran, who was the last man to secure a U.S. triumph on European soil in 1993, sat listening to Mickelson's monologue with a painted smile on his face. He then replied: ""(Phil) has a difference of opinion. That's OK. My management philosophy is different than his. I had a different philosophy than Paul. I decided not to go that way."" Prior to the 40th installment of the competition in Scotland, CNN spoke to Azinger, who laid out the principles he felt were instrumental in sealing what is still America's only triumph this century. One of the fundamental aspects of his captaincy centered around a pod system, relating to the way dolphins coexist with one another, where the 12 players are split into three teams of four. ""I tried to get my players invested and engaged in the process early,"" Azinger told CNN's Living Golf show. ""Then I gave ownership of their little small man groups and empowered them by allowing them to pick who filled out their team. These guys bonded and we were bonded as a team with a secret. ""That's what we built prior to the matches and prior to showing up at Valhalla."" Azinger, who revealed he'd spoken to Watson before the tournament but had ""no idea"" what the captain was planning, wrote a book about his success called 'Cracking the Code.' In it he details how the ""code"" was concerned with team building and applying business principles to the Ryder Cup formula. It also embraced the Myers-Briggs test -- used by government agencies, colleges and HR departments -- to group people together based on their personality traits. ""The code was through observation,"" he explained. ""I see what Europe has in place; the Spaniards play together, the Irishmen, the Englishmen. ""If there's crossover you'll get best friends like an Irishman in Darren Clarke and an Englishman like Lee Westwood, so there's small groups already in place. ""I'm using their personality types to put the players in groups through observation about who they are, breaking everybody into four personality types. It was really a leadership philosophy to team building that's the code. ""It became more of a relational story than a golf event for me and for our players. Of course they played great but we created the atmosphere and platform for them to play their best. ""The code was that Europe had small groups, we went with small groups, that's a Navy Seals philosophy to team building. ""To apply those militaristic principles and those business principles to a sporting event and watch it unfold the way it did -- that was the cracking of the code to me."" Europe's players were falling over themselves to praise their captain, Paul McGinley, who they said was meticulous in his preparation. Not only did McGinley get to know his players over the course of his captaincy, he also ensured they all felt invested, even detailing one of his five vice-captains to look after those players who weren't selected to play. The Irishman also prepared motivational speeches and videos for his team, even going so far to ensure the goldfish in Europe's team room were blue and gold -- the colors of the continent's flag. McGinley would surely have scored highly in Azinger's recipe for what constitutes a good captain. ""A great captain has to be organized,"" Azinger said. ""You have to have the willingness to surround yourself with people that can help you, and you have to make it not about you, you have to make the captaincy about the players around you. ""You have to realize you don't get to play but that you have a responsibility and a leadership role of making the guys around you comfortable, confident. ""I wanted everyone to have confidence in my confidence in them. And treat them like men, they are professionals. ""I messaged players according to their personality type, situational messaging -- I didn't give everyone the same message. ""You have to build that type of environment and then you have to get out of their way."" The calls for Azinger to reprise his role in 2016 began almost as soon as the U.S. defeat was confirmed. Mickelson's praise was followed by a tweet from Jason Dufner, a member of the U.S. team that succumbed to the ""Miracle of Medinah"" back in 2012, that read""@PaulAzinger #2016."" ""We all do the best that we can and we're all trying our hardest, and I'm just looking back at what gave us the most success,"" Mickelson added in his Azinger tribute. ""Unfortunately, we have strayed from a winning formula in 2008 for the last three Ryder Cups, and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.""","Paul Azinger is hotly tipped to be the United States Ryder Cup captain in 2016 .

"Qunu, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten days of mourning for South Africa's anti-apartheid icon and former leader Nelson Mandela will come to an end Sunday with his state funeral. After Tuesday's vibrant, if rain-drenched, memorial service, followed by three days of public viewing of the former president's casket in Pretoria, the burial will be a slightly more private affair. About 100,000 people have paid homage to Mandela in those three days, including 50,000 who came to pay their respects Friday, the South African government said. Here is how CNN expects events to unfold, based on information from the government and sources involved in planning for the funeral -- although plans may change because of weather, security and other factors. Return to the Eastern Cape . A military plane carrying Mandela's body flew Saturday from an air force base in Pretoria to South Africa's Eastern Cape province, where Mandela's ancestral village of Qunu lies. The family farm there will be his final resting place. President Jacob Zuma and other members of South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, gathered to bid Mandela farewell from the air force base. ""We will miss him. He was our leader in a special time,"" said Zuma. Mandela's casket, draped in the national flag, was carried by soldiers to the plane. Thousands of mourners lined the streets from Mthatha Airport, the closest to Qunu, as Mandela's remains were transported to the remote village where he spent much of his childhood. Traditional ceremony and vigil . Once at Mandela's house in Qunu, the military was expected formally to pass responsibility for his remains to his family. The South African flag draped over the coffin will be replaced with a tribal symbol of the Xhosa people, symbolizing the return of one of their own. At dusk, ANC leaders, local chiefs and the men in Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil, held according to the traditions of the Thembu community, his native clan, before a public funeral the next day. Villagers may gather outside the house to pay their respects. The coffin will lie in Mandela's bedroom overnight. The room overlooks the hills around Qunu and his grave site. Who's attending . Foreign leaders were encouraged to attend Tuesday's memorial service in Johannesburg. Nonetheless, dozens of international dignitaries are expected to make their way to the Eastern Cape for Mandela's funeral. The airport in East London, south of Qunu, will be used for their arrival and departure, with access closely controlled. Notable figures thought to be on the guest list include Britain's Prince Charles, TV talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and U.S. civil rights activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson. There's no doubting the global media interest. More than 4,000 journalists had been accredited as of Friday morning, with more expected, a government spokeswoman said. However, only the national broadcaster will be given access to the funeral, with other journalists in Qunu to be based at the Nelson Mandela Museum. The event will be broadcast to an audience of millions around the world. The funeral . A private family prayer service will be held Sunday morning at Mandela's home. The funeral will then be held in a huge white tent set up at the family farm. The Mandela family, President Zuma and Cabinet members will be present as well as local and foreign dignitaries. About 4,500 people are expected. The military will again be charged with draping Mandela's coffin with the flag. Members of the military will perform a salute, and the national anthem will be played. The burial . A group of family and close friends, expected to number about 430, will walk up to the grave site to bid a final farewell to the man many saw as the father of their nation. About 2 p.m. -- when the summer sun is high in the sky -- Mandela will be laid to rest in the rocky soil of his childhood home. The burial area has been especially built for him; some of Mandela's long deceased family members are already buried at the site. It will be, according to custom, a homecoming. His grave site is surrounded by rocky outcrops, hardy grass used for the grazing of cattle and bright orange aloe plants. The aloes are indigenous succulents that are hardy, drought-resistant, medicinal plants that bloom across the bushveld when all else is dry and dull. They can be seen as a symbolic floral gesture to a man whose life was filled with sacrifice and tragedy but who triumphed with a tenacity of spirit and hope in even the darkest of days. Security . With so many high-profile guests in South Africa for Mandela's state funeral, security has been a key concern. Zuma has authorized nearly 12,000 members of the South African National Defence Force to serve alongside the police force ""to maintain law and order"" during the funeral period, the presidency said. They are employed for 15 days, from December 6 to December 20. A tight military cordon is expected around the funeral site to assuage security fears. CNN's Robyn Curnow reported from inside the Mandela compound in Qunu, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.","NEW: Mandela's body reaches the village of Qunu, in South Africa's Eastern Cape province .

"(CNN) -- Despite its obvious advantages -- there's less rubber on the road, there are fewer moving parts and both your hands are free for carrying the shopping -- one-wheeled transport has had a patchy history. From the impressive and futuristic ""dynasphere"" prototype of the 1930s to the circus unicycle, mono-wheeled transport has suffered a fatal design flaw: it's difficult to steer. Typically in a two-wheeled vehicle, one wheel provides the motor force while the other does the steering. In a mono-wheel or unicycle, the wheel has to do both jobs. Now, thanks to more advanced, cheaper and smaller gyroscopes, all that is about to change. Companies such as Ryno Motors in the United States and Airwheel in the UK are producing unicycles with internal stabilizers that will scoot a passenger along at 12mph. Portable, cheap to run and fun to ride, Airwheel is now the supplier of the Chinese-made unicycles for the English postal service Whistl which is trialing a fleet for its mailmen in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. But it's not just mailmen that are giving the futuristic transport the thumbs up. City commuters are now using them to get that final leg from the Tube station to home. ""They immediately put people in mind of the hoverboard in 'Back to the Future,'"" said Simon Parham, CEO of the London-based company. ""In many ways, it feels like technology and science is headed in that direction; towards that mode of transport."" The electric unicycle has an effective range of 28 miles, can recharge its batteries when it goes downhill and is rugged enough to gutter jump and even take off road. ""It really feels like you're gliding on nothing,"" said Parham, a former stuntman in James Bond films. ""You could relate it to something like snowboarding or skiing but obviously you're doing it on concrete and gliding around at your leisure rather than requiring mountains and snow."" He said that he could see the efficacy of and market for the devices immediately and hadn't even ridden one before he decided to become a distributor for the gadgets. ""We were aware that people might want them just for fun but we've been somewhat overwhelmed by how interested business commuters have been in using them to drive into the center of cities or to get to the train station."" Some customers, he said, had found uses for the electric unicycle that his company had not even imagined. ""We got an email from a disabled user who had mobility problems who was now able to go on nature walks with her partner -- they would hold hands and actually go quite some distance off-road with these which really opened up a new lease of life for her,"" Parham said. Already designers are looking at unicycles that can go further, faster and are even more lightweight and easier to ride. ""Compared with a Segway for example they're already so lightweight,"" he said, referring to the electric two-wheeled personal transporter. ""I can't imagine picking up a Segway, whereas with an Airwheel, you can scoot to your station, stick it on the overhead compartment, get to your destination, take it down and scoot to work. ""It's a fun alternative means of transport and there's a market for it."" The company sells a twin-wheeled version, which is easier to learn to ride, and a smaller one-wheeled version that Parham says everyone has been able to negotiate after a sometimes shaky start. Like a Segway, the driver must shift their weight forward to make the unicycle accelerate and lean backwards to slow down and brake. But the proof of the pudding, as they say, is in the eating and Airwheel say that ""posties"" -- as mailmen are called in Britain -- have taken to its ease of use and rugged go-anywhere design. The chief executive officer of Whistl, Nick Wells, said in a statement that the postal company had a long track record of innovation. ""This radical new delivery device grabbed our attention,"" Wells said. ""Our teman have had fun getting to grips with the gadget and it's gone down well with customers too. ""We are committed to ongoing efficiency and if the trial proves successful then the Airwheel will be adopted by Whistl posties across the United Kingdom.""","Electric unicycles are being trialed in Britain with more than 100 mailmen .

"(CNN) -- How would you like to trim three hours off the current commercial jet flight time between Paris and Washington, D.C.? Or two hours and 48 minutes off the flight between New York and Sao Paulo? Or two and a half hours between Tokyo and Singapore? With its Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet, the Nevada-based Aerion Corporation aims to do just that. Now it has a gigantic new partner to help it realize those ambitions: Airbus. The two companies announced this week that they'll collaborate on technologies and ""capabilities in design, manufacturing and certification"" to advance the development of the AS2. ""This is a major step forward for Aerion,"" said Aerion chairman and principal investor, Robert M. Bass in a statement. ""It puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world's first supersonic business jet in 2021."" ""This agreement accomplishes two major objectives,"" said Aerion CEO Doug Nichols. ""It provides validation from the industry leader in aerospace innovation, and it decisively kicks the program into high gear. Each company will benefit."" Aerion was founded in 2002 with the intention of commercializing supersonic aviation technology. Expertise from Airbus' Defence and Space Division . Using its proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology, Aerion says the AS2 will fly at Mach 1.6 (1,217 mph). The Airbus group's Defence and Space Division will provide technical and certification support to Aerion, with its engineers working with the company in Nevada. According to the U.S.-based aviation consulting firm Leeham Company, the aircraft's engine partner hasn't yet been announced. Aerion says the AS2's newly designed wings reduce overall drag by 20%, allowing for lower fuel consumption and longer range. Its 30-foot-long cabin is forecast to seat up to 12 passengers in business-style comfort. All seats can be berthed to sleep four on overnight flights. The projected price of the AS2 is more than $100 million. Aerion hopes to begin test flights by 2019. Race to develop supersonic biz jets . A handful of companies are developing private supersonic business jets. Boston-based Spike Aerospace's S-512 Supersonic Jet is designed to fly at Mach 1.6, while seating 12 to 18 passengers. The company says the plane will fly from London to New York in three hours and from Los Angeles to Tokyo in six hours. UK-based HyperMach is developing the SonicStar, a business jet it claims will be capable of reaching Mach 4 (about 2,600 mph, or almost twice the speed of the Concorde), and which it says will be able to make the flight from New York to Dubai ""in the time it takes to watch an inflight movie."" The company has said the plane could enter production in the 2020s. The world's only supersonic passenger jet service ended in October 2003 when British Airways retired the Concorde from service. The Concorde had a cruising speed of 1,350 mph, more than twice the speed of sound. A typical London to New York flight took a little less than three and a half hours, as opposed to about eight hours for subsonic flights. Modern commercial long-haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480 and 560 mph.","Nevada-based Aerion and Airbus announce collaboration on AS2 supersonic business jet .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a gadget that knows your mind better than you do. Picture a device that can rank the activities in your life that bring you joy, or interject your typed words with your feelings. One woman has helped create just that. Ariel Garten believes that the brain -- with its 100 billion neurons that receive, register, and respond to thoughts and impulses -- has the power to accomplish almost anything, if only its power could be properly harnessed. Her company InteraXon, which she co-founded with Trevor Coleman, has produced Muse, a lightweight headband that uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to monitor your brain activity, transmitting that information to a smartphone, laptop or tablet. The high-tech headband has been used to pour beer, levitate chairs, or control the lights -- all without the wearer lifting a finger. And in a world where technology is often blamed for raising stress levels, 35-year-old Garten believes her $300 headband could even help calm us down. The Canadian -- who has worked as a fashion designer, art gallery director, and psychotherapist -- spoke to CNN about her influences and vision for the future of technology. CNN: How does Muse help reduce stress? Ariel Garten: Muse tracks your brain activity. Your brain sends electro-signals just like your heart does, and this headband is like a heart rate monitor. As it tracks your brain activity, it sends that information to your computer, smartphone or tablet, where you can do exercises that track your brain activity in real time, and give you real time feedback to teach you how to calm and settle your mind. CNN: Technology is often blamed for making people stressed -- is there a certain irony in also using it to also calm us down? AG: Technology can definitely be responsible for making people stressed because it pulls at our attention, it distracts us, it increases the number of demands and in some ways decreases our own agency. We're very interested in inverting that on its head and creating solutions that help you calm yourself; that can help you stay grounded, choose what to focus your attention on, and manage your own mind and your response to the world. Technology itself is not the evil, it's the way that it's implemented. Technology can have some great solutions for us. Look at all the amazing medical interventions that we have. CNN: You've suggested Muse could provide medical benefits for children with ADD -- how? AG: To be clear, Muse is not a medical device, it's a computer product. Exercises using Muse have suggested that they can help people with ADHD, by helping you increase your state of focused attention. We've had amazing emails -- just recently we had an email from somebody who is 29 years old with ADHD and after just two days of using Muse had noticed a benefit. Three weeks out they sent me an email saying 'this is not a game changer, this is a life changer.' CNN: Have you had interest in the product from any unexpected places? AG: We've been contacted by a lot of sports stars and sports celebrities -- people wanting to use it to improve their sports game. We were surprised because we're so used to thinking of it as a cognitive tool. There's been quite a number of research labs using Muse, and they've been looking at applications in depression, epilepsy, and communications. And then we've also had a lot of interest from companies interested in integrating our technology into their wellness and development programs. Companies like Google wanting to offer this to their employees to help improve their productivity and their wellness. CNN: Do you have any reservations about the development of mind-mapping devices? AG: In InteraXon we believe very strongly that you own all your own data. We have a very strict privacy policy. It's like a heart rate monitor, it's very binary so we can't read your thoughts, we can't read your mind. But we're very much into leading the way on the very responsible use of this technology. CNN: What inspired you to get involved in this area? AG: My background is in neuroscience, design and psychotherapy, and I'm very interested in helping people understand their own minds and use their minds more productively in their own life. Our brains get in our way in so many ways. The things that we think, the feelings that we have, all of these things can be beautiful supports to our life and encourage the lives that we live. But they can also cause all kinds of anxiety, worries, all of these things that hold us back. Particularly women are a huge inspiration to me because we're so good at holding ourselves back with the thoughts that are in our heads. We're constantly worried about things like 'does this person think this way about me?' or 'have I done well enough?' or 'have I achieved as much as I'm supposed to?' We have these dialogues within ourselves that can be really debilitating, and you know the answer is 'of course you're good enough,' and 'of course you've done well enough,' and 'of course you can achieve that.' And if you can learn to understand and gain control over your own internal dialogue, you can really learn to sort of undo the shackles that hold you back in your daily life, and your career, and your relationships.

"(CNN) -- In the digital age, consumers expect more and more from their cars, and all brands are pushing the technological envelope. Swedish car company, Volvo, is hoping to deliver on the driver's expectations, adding an option that's far beyond anything that's under the hood. Klas Bendrik, CIO of Volvo Car Group, is one of the brains behind the Roam delivery service, which aims to make e-shopping and deliveries more convenient. CNN: How does Roam work? Klars Bendrik: How it would work is that a customer, via an online store, places a purchase then chooses the car as the delivery point. Then the transportation company gets the opportunity to deliver the goods directly to the vehicle and via a digital key, the transportation company is granted access to the customer's vehicle. When the delivery has been made, the customer gets a confirmation back that the delivery has been done. CNN: How will you allay customer safety fears in giving complete strangers access to their vehicle? KB: When it comes to safety and security, this is very important to us within Volvo cars. That goes for physical safety as well as virtual safety, so in this we're working heavily with digital keys and digital certificates in order to ensure security for our customers. The customer grants that the delivery can be made and then gets the confirmation back once the delivery has been made, and that specific digital key ceases to exist. CNN: What challenges have there been in orchestrating this venture? KB: One of the biggest challenges has been that Volvo is only one part of the delivery chain with online shoppers. There's transportation companies, our customers and our vehicles, and bringing those aspects together has been one of the most challenging part. CNN: What are the benefits of using Roam? If you take the example of consumers, online shopping is one of the areas where consumers can save time, money, and also add convenience to their lives. One of the challenges with online shopping is actually the delivery. When the delivery is supposed to be made, for example to homes, or in suburban areas, that becomes a hassle; because the owner of the house is working, out of town and the delivery is sometimes bouncing. So the delivery company usually tries to make the delivery not only once, maybe twice, even three times. The Roam delivery service actually adds convenience and simplicity both for the customers and as well as for the distribution companies. The challenge now [is] to perfect the concept and get delivery companies to buy into the innovation. CNN: What effects will the service have on the automotive industry? What we see today is that the car becomes connected, the customer becomes connected, that actually means that the car is part of the digital ecosystem and is integrated in the network society. And that has the opportunity to add additional services, connected services, to us as a society and also to us owners of the vehicle. And this is an area where we can see a rapid change within the automotive industry. READ MORE: Uber gets into the delivery game with Rush . WATCH: Turning mobile advertising on its head .

"(CNN) -- Football clubs spend big money on big players to deliver on the biggest stage. And no doubt Arsenal view the $58 million they spent on Alexis Sanchez as a bargain after his heroics secured its passage to yet another European Champions League group stage. Remarkably, a nervy 1-0 victory over Turkish side Besiktas in the two-legged playoff tie means Arsene Wenger's men will take their place in the draw for the 17th consecutive season. Qualification also brings with it a $33 million windfall, meaning Sanchez has already paid off a large chunk of the fee it cost the club to prise him from Spanish giants Barcelona. Now the Gunners will line up alongside the cream of Europe, including European champions Real Madrid and German champions Bayern Munich, in Thursday's draw. A relieved Wenger told Sky Sports: ""We needed to keep our nerve but we kept our nerve, were united and showed great solidarity. ""We wanted to be there and not go down a division in Europe. We had chances to score more but in two games we kept a clean sheet and it made a difference."" Asked if it was unthinkable for Arsenal not to qualify Wenger said: ""It is unthinkable until it happens. ""For us it is a weight off our shoulders, we can now focus on the Premier League and wait for the draw. We feel we have done the job and have our conscience clear."" Wenger also confirmed striker Olivier Giroud would be missing until at least December after undergoing surgery on an ankle injury, and said he would dip into the transfer market if he could find a forward of suitable quality. After a disappointing 0-0 draw in Turkey last week, the first opportunity of the evening fell to Jack Wilshere, but after pouncing on a loose ball when Sanchez was fouled, the England star fired wide of the target. Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, who wasted several opportunities in the first leg, narrowly failed to poke the ball past Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny as the Turkish side showed they could still pose an offensive threat. And hearts were in mouths at the Emirates when defender Mathieu Debuchy slid in to tackle Mustafa Pektemek and appeared to get only a marginal touch on the ball inside the penalty area. But just as the home fans began to express their agitation, Sanchez found the net. The Chilean scampered into the area as Wilshere swapped passes with German World Cup winner Mesut Ozil, to fire low past Besiktas goalkeeper Tolga Zengin. Sanchez had a chance to double Arsenal's lead on 51 minutes after more neat approach play from Wilshere, the 22-year-old sliding the ball to his Chilean teammate only to see it stabbed wide of the far post. Ba had another chance to stall the Gunners' momentum as he turned inside the area, but his shot from a narrow angle could only find the side-netting. Arsenal then wasted two glorious chances to make the tie safe. With Besiktas pushing men forward, Arsenal broke and Sanchez drove into the penalty area before teeing up Cazorla, but the Spaniard's shot was blocked. Seconds later Nacho Monreal swung in a low cross and though Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sneaked in front of his marker, he could only fire against Tolga from six yards out. A nervy climax was ensured when Debuchy was dismissed for a second bookable offense with 15 minutes left, the defender remonstrating with the referee before trudging off. Ba failed to connect with a late header, and Arsenal were penned in as the Turks desperately sought the goal they needed, but they held on to seal victory. Elsewhere, Spanish side Athletic Bilbao came from behind to eliminate Napoli, from Italy, and take its place in the European Champions League group stages for the first time in 16 years. Germany's Bayer Leverkusen also progressed after a 7-2 aggregate victory over Danish outfit FC Copenhagen. Ludogorets Razgrad, of Bulgaria, made the group stages for the first time after a fairytale penalty shootout victory over Romania's Steaua Bucurest. After goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov was sent off in extra time, defender Cosmin Moti donned the gloves as the tie finished 1-1 on aggregate after extra time. Incredibly, Moti took his side's opening penalty, and scored, before saving two of Steaua's and sealing a remarkable victory for his side.","Alexis Sanchez seals Arsenal's progress to European Champions League group stages .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- A secret audio recording of their biggest election year target -- Sen. Mitch McConnell -- talking to a donor summit arranged by the Koch brothers, the Democrats' 2014 bogeymen. Democrats pushed ""The Nation"" story around online with frenetic glee. McConnell's Democratic challenger for his Kentucky seat, Alison Lundergan Grimes, couldn't wait to whack him on it, telling CNN in an exclusive interview that ""Mitch McConnell got caught in his 47% Mitt Romney moment."" ""I think it shows the extent and the lengths he will go to to pander to his party millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hurting Kentuckians,"" Grimes told CNN. The problem with the Democrats' argument is that Romney's 47% moment was only a moment because he was saying to donors in private something he would never have dared to utter in public: . ""Forty-seven percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement,"" Romney said behind closed doors about President Obama's supporters in 2012. But unlike Romney, what McConnell said to the Koch brothers are things he has said in public, and more importantly, his comments mirror positions he has publicly backed with actual Senate votes: opposition to Democrats' plans to increase the minimum wage, extend unemployment insurance and make student loans more affordable through the tax system. If Republicans are in charge, he said, those won't be coming back to the Senate floor. ""We're not going to be debating all these gosh-darn proposals,"" McConnell told the Koch brothers and the rest of the room full of billionaire donors. McConnell also talked about plans, if he becomes Senate majority leader, to attach policy riders to spending bills that would defund regulations President Obama has put in place that Republicans loathe. ""I didn't say anything in the private meeting I haven't said publicly,"" McConnell told CNN in another exclusive interview, saying he stands by his comments. When I put that reality to Grimes, she didn't back down on her attack. In fact she doubled down. ""I think this recording is alarming. He has promised further gridlock if elected but this is action he will directly take at the expense of Kentuckians,"" Grimes said. A little context is in order for why Democrats are jumping on this like a fatal pre-Labor Day surprise: . First, it's all about the Koch brothers. Democrats believe, based on internal polling, that voters think the system is rigged against them and that's why they're struggling. The Democratic strategy in all the key races for control of the Senate is for the billionaire Koch brothers to become the poster boys for the rigged system -- that they pour tens of millions into the system to help Republicans, so Republicans help keep them rich. Given that, having a muffled audio recording of the Senate GOP leader addressing those fat cats, whether he is saying anything new or not, is in fact politically beneficial to Democrats. It helps perpetuate the narrative they believe has legs. The fact that McConnell vowed no more debate on Democrats ""gosh-darn proposals"" also gives Grimes an opening on another key argument against McConnell: that he is the personification of gridlock in Washington. Elect him, and it will only get worse. The downside for Democrats is that they're not exactly clean when it comes to taking billionaire cash. They, too, have high-rolling donors pouring unlimited dollars into the system on behalf of Democrats. But make no mistake about it: This secret audio recording will be front and center in Grimes' campaign and others for the near future. Whether it will foment anti-McConnell fever here will depend in large part on how much is really already lying beneath the surface in this neck-and-neck race.","Tape catches Mitch McConnell talking to a summit run by top GOP donors .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Delia Garcia traveled hundreds of miles to spend Mother's Day marching in Mexico's capital. It is her latest stop in the search for her son, who went missing more than two years ago after he was kidnapped by a group who drove up in trucks to the doors of her house in the northern city of Torreon. ""That day, they took my son's life and they took mine. They took half my life, because this half, I am using to search for him,"" Garcia said. She was among a group of mothers and other family members marching in Mexico City on Thursday, Mother's Day in Mexico and several other Latin American countries. Holding signs with pictures of their missing sons and daughters, they said they came with the hope of being heard. But they said they were also tired of waiting, claiming that the authorities have not done enough to find the thousands of people who have disappeared as a brutal drug war embroils the nation. ""The first few days I lived with fear. I lived with a lot of fear, but seeing that they were not doing anything, I decided to make my signs and go out and look for him, and let people know that I am searching for my son,"" said Irma Alicia, whose said her son disappeared in Mexico's capital on March 23. Alicia said she was still waiting for answers. Vanishing victims: The 'open wounds' of Mexico's drug war . Others told similar stories. Jose Antonio Torres said communication was even more difficult for his family; many of them are deaf, including five people who went missing while selling calendars in the state of Coahuila on February 23. ""The authorities don't give any response. They don't give information, and there is a lack of communication between the authorities and people with disabilities. There are not translators in the government offices,"" he said. Without information, they have searched on their own, finding whatever details they can about the cases. ""They were at an intersection in Piedras Negras, and we know that a black truck with armed and masked gunmen took them,"" Torres said. ""They were simply working in the street, on a public road."" Such stories are becoming increasingly common throughout the country, where government statistics indicate more than 47,000 people have died in drug-related violence since President Felipe Calderon declared a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. According to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, more than 5,300 people have disappeared throughout the country in that same time period. And the bodies of 9,000 dead have not been identified. Officials fear the total number of missing could be far higher, because many disappearances go unreported. In October, Calderon said the ""very high"" number of missing people was a growing concern. He listed them among the victims of violence that he described as ""open wounds"" in Mexican society. ""We don't know the size of the problem,"" the president said during a speech inaugurating a new prosecutor's office aimed at helping victims. But no matter the statistics, mothers marching in Mexico's capital Thursday said they would not stop until their children are found. ""This is a call for help, a call for an immediate search, but above all a call of love,"" Garcia said. ""Let our children know that we love them, that we are searching for them and we need them.""

"(CNN) -- Country singer Randy Travis left a Texas hospital and entered a physical therapy facility, his publicist said Wednesday. The release and transfer came three weeks after Travis was admitted to The Heart Hospital at Baylor Plano for treatment of congestive heart failure. He later suffered a stroke, which doctors said was a complication of the heart failure. ""Thanks to all the fans and friends for your continued prayers and support as Randy continues on the road to recovery,"" his fiance Mary Davis said in a written statement Wednesday. Travis, 54, was initially hospitalized July 7 at Baylor Medical Center at McKinney, Texas, with a presumptive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, according to publicist Kirt Webster. The singer transferred to The Heart Hospital the next day. Travis' illness is related to his ""recently acquired viral cardiomyopathy,"" one of his doctors said. Viral cardiomyopathy is a disorder where a virus attacks the muscles of the heart, causing the heart to beat slower, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website. In some cases, the heart can stop, it said. Travis had a tough year in 2012 with arrests for assault and public intoxication, which earned him probation. Travis was at the forefront of the ""New Traditionalist"" movement in the 1980s and 1990s, but he faded as the '90s wore on. He made a comeback after turning to gospel music in 1999. His song ""Three Wooden Crosses"" won song of the year in 2003 from both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music.","Travis entered a Texas hospital for treatment of congestive heart failure on July 7 .

"(CNN) -- Under CEO Marissa Mayer, Yahoo might still be trying to shed its image as a relic of the 1990s Internet era. But hey, it's getting a new logo! Yahoo announced Wednesday that it will unveil a new corporate logo September 4 -- the first such change since the company was founded 18 years ago. The new look will retain the current purple color scheme and, yes, its trademark exclamation point. Yodel away, Yahoo fans. ""Over the past year, there's been a renewed sense of purpose and progress at Yahoo!, and we want everything we do to reflect this spirit of innovation,"" Chief Marketing Officer Kathy Savitt wrote in a blog post. ""While the company is rapidly evolving, our logo â€” the essence of our brand â€” should too."" To build some buzz around the new logo, the Internet company will display a different variation of the logo on its homepage and throughout its network in the United States for each of the next 30 days. The first example, shown above, opts for a more streamlined look, although the second ""O"" is larger than the first, reflecting -- in Yahoo's words -- the company's "" fun, vibrant, and welcoming"" character. The variations on the new logo -- this video clip offers a potential preview -- also will be showcased each day on Yahoo's Twitter account (#dailylogo). Mayer has been working to reinvent the struggling Yahoo since she took over leadership of the company in July of last year. In the past 12 months Yahoo has bought more than 16 startups, including the popular Tumblr blogging platform, and reinvigorated its older brands such as photo site Flickr. Under her reign, Yahoo's stock price has climbed from $15 to almost $30 (it's currently at $27), although some analysts remain skeptical about the company's long-term fortunes. Yahoo's rebranding follows similar logo changes by other aging Internet giants, including AOL, eBay and Microsoft. ""The new logo will be a modern redesign that's more reflective of our reimagined design and new experiences,"" Savitt said.","Yahoo will unveil a new corporate logo September 4 .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine and Russia plan to approve a road map to improved trade relations on Tuesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said Sunday in a late-night interview on Ukraine's national broadcaster, Inter TV. The announcement comes just hours after a European Union officer said the EU had halted work on a trade agreement with Ukraine, after Kiev failed to show ""clear commitment"" to signing the deal. Stefan Fule, European commissioner for enlargement and European neighborhood policy, said earlier Sunday on Twitter that the words and deeds of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government on the proposed pact were ""further & further apart. Their arguments have no grounds in reality."" Fule said he had told Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov in Brussels, Belgium, last week that further discussion on the agreement was conditional on a clear commitment by Kiev to sign the deal, but he had received no response. ""Work on hold, had no answer,"" he tweeted. Last month, Kiev spurned the agreement in favor of closer economic ties with Moscow, and the prime minister's Sunday night interview revealed new details about that relationship. Azarov said that in addition to the trade relations deal, he hoped an agreement could be reached Tuesday on gas commerce, which would hopefully provide a solution for Ukraine's unprofitable gas transportation system. ""We hope to renew negotiations about the three-party consortium, which would include Europe as well, to provide transparent conditions for gas transit and gas transportation system management,"" Azarov said. However, Azarov rejected claims that Ukraine is leaning toward joining Russia and other former Soviet republics in the Customs Union. ""These are speculations. None of the papers we have prepared are in any way related to the Customs Union,"" he said. Ukraine's recent diplomatic activity has sparked mass protests. Thousands of people have poured onto the streets of the capital, angered by the government's U-turn away from integration with Europe. Setting up tents and barricades, they have stood their ground in Kiev's Independence Square, known as the Maidan, paralyzing the center of the capital. On Sunday the protesters were addressed by U.S. Sen. John McCain, who has been critical of Ukrainian authorities' use of force against demonstrators. ""People of Ukraine, this is your moment. This is about you, no one else. This is about the future you want for your country. This is about the future you deserve,"" he said to loud cheers and chants of ""Thank you."" ""A future in Europe, a future of peace, with all of your neighbors. The free world is with you, America is with you, I am with you."" The senator visited Independence Square on Saturday, where he snapped pictures with his cell phone as he met with opposition leaders. He was accompanied on stage Sunday by Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut. ""Ukraine will make Europe better and Europe will make Ukraine better,"" McCain said. A pro-government rally was also being held Sunday. The anti-government demonstrations are the biggest since the Orange Revolution overturned the results of the eastern European country's 2004 presidential election. East vs. West . The EU had kept its offer on the table, and the bloc's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, on Thursday said Yanukovych had assured her Kiev intended to sign the deal after she met with him. A day earlier, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov told a government meeting Ukraine was still open to signing the European integration deal, if the European Union would agree to provide financial assistance to Ukraine of around 20 billion euros ($27.5 billion). On Sunday however, an EU diplomat told CNN there was ""lack of clear commitment and timetable."" ""We have had no reply (on timetable) from the Ukrainian authorities and so there is no basis to continue work,"" the diplomat added. Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west of the country and a more Russia-oriented east. Protesters say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. They accuse Yanukovych of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union. Moscow has leverage that may have affected Yanukovych's decision last month to backpedal on the EU talks because Russia supplies Ukraine with natural gas. The EU is also pressuring Yanukovych to free his chief political opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko, who has languished in jail for two years after being convicted of abuse of power in 2011. The EU and other critics decried the verdict as a sham. The Orange Revolution that swept Yanukovych from office in 2004 also brought the pro-Western Tymoshenko to power. At the rallies in Independence Square, protesters have carried her picture. Investigation . Kiev's handling of the protests has been met with stern responses from Western governments. In an overnight crackdown last week, police tore down barricades the protesters had set up. Before that, violence had broken out at a previous demonstration. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating some top government officials over the beating of students at anti-government protests two weeks ago. The subjects of the criminal investigation include Ukrainian Deputy Secretary for National Security Vladimir Sivkovich, Kiev Police Chief Valery Koryak and Kiev Mayor Oleksandr Popov. A fourth person also is under investigation. The case will be put before a judge on Monday, who could order house arrest for those being investigated, said Valery Vilkova, spokeswoman for the general prosecutor.

"(CNN) -- John Cossman's friends call him cancer's iron man. He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago. The cancer has spread to his right lung, his right arm and his brain. Four years ago, he ran out of treatment options -- every available form of chemo had been used. If he wanted to live, he'd have to enter clinical trials. ""How long do I have here?"" he asked his doctor. ""With treatment, two years,"" the doctor responded. ""Without treatment, six months."" Now, Cossman, 61, is sitting in a doctor's office, ready to undergo a CT scan that will determine if his cancer is being kept in check. He's on his fourth clinical trial. Three times, he's heard bad news. He tries not to think about that as he slides into the giant machine that envelopes his body. He thinks instead of his wife and 13-year-old daughter, adopted from China. Life offers too much to give in. ""I will know when there's not a whole helluva lot of time left. And I don't feel that way right now. ... If what I'm doing can help somebody down the line, then it's worthwhile."" Holding disease at bay . Cossman is one of 16 patients with progressive forms of cancer currently taking part in a study of a developmental drug by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Cerulean Pharma. The company hopes to add another 20 patients to the trial in laboratories in Arizona, California and New Mexico. The test drug is in the second phase of a three-phase process that takes years before the Food and Drug Administration even considers whether to bring the drug to market. Cossman is one of the tens of thousands of people worldwide enrolled in drug trials. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, there are more than 96,500 trials under way in 174 countries. Cossman learned of drug trials through his oncologist --""otherwise, I'd know nothing about them."" He wants to make others ""aware of head and neck cancer, and that clinical trials are available,"" he says. ""People need to be aware, though, that they are rolling the dice."" In this case, the chemotherapy drug, known as CRLX101, is placed inside nanoparticles -- tiny particles just slightly bigger than molecules -- that are delivered intravenously every two weeks to patients. The hope is that the nanoparticles target the cancer and release chemotherapy inside the tumors while shielding healthy tissue from the toxicity of chemo, says Oliver Fetzer, the president and CEO of Cerulean. By doing that, the drug homes in on the tumors and, at the same time, patients can maintain a decent quality of life. ""You want to see how long you can actually hold the disease at bay,"" Fetzer says. Adds John Ryan, Cerulean's chief medical officer: ""The true measure of success in oncology is extending the length of time someone stays alive."" Yet this drug is far from market. The FDA can put a stop to a clinical trial at any moment if unexpected safety issues arise. ""We keep in touch with the FDA constantly throughout the clinical trial,"" Ryan says. ""There's a constant interchange with the FDA, particularly with respect to the safety of the drug and anything unexpected."" It takes about nine years for an oncology drug to go through the necessary clinical studies to FDA approval, said Dr. Kenneth Kaitin, director of The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, an independent nonprofit research group. According to a 2007 study by the center, a drug company spends about $1.3 billion per approved product, a figure that includes costs of failed test drugs. When the test drug is for cancer, the patients have very aggressive forms. Success is often measured in small steps. ""What you're normally looking at in this patient population, if you can keep it at bay for two months, you are actually doing quite well, because the patients are so far along"" with cancer, says Fetzer. ""It's a rule of thumb at best, because every disease is different, every patient is different."" 'I went through every type of chemo' It started with a lump in his throat eight years ago. Cossman thought it would go away. His doctor diagnosed it as head and neck cancer -- a surprise to Cossman because he's never been a heavy drinker or smoker. He underwent 36 radiation and chemo treatments over 2½ months. He survived on a feeding tube for six months. The next three years would be cancer free. But in June 2005, a tumor popped up in his right lower lung. Chemo and radiation began again. The tumor was eliminated, yet a spot showed up again about a year later. ""You get to a point where they can't radiate the lung any more."" He still has breathing problems from the radiation to his lung. One chemo treatment clogged up his tear ducts. Another created a rash all over his body. ""By June 2006,"" he says, ""I went through every type of chemo that's been approved for head and neck cancer. The chemo would either stop working or the side effects would be more detrimental to my health."" His option: Die or enter clinical trials. The first study kept his tumors -- by that time he had four -- in check for about five months. To remain in a trial, tumor growth has to be limited to 20 percent. A scan showed 22 percent growth. ""You can't immediately go from one study to another. You have to be washed out for 30 days of chemicals and radiation."" In his second study, he developed a tumor on his right arm. He soon was having vision problems and started losing his hair. The man who had already endured so much was diagnosed with a brain tumor. In December, he underwent surgery to remove it. His third study earlier this year did not work. ""You hold your breath, hoping that it's working. Then, when the CT scan comes back and it shows the tumors are growing, it's really frustrating."" ""Do I get depressed? Yes. But do I want to give up? No,"" he says. So Cossman entered his fourth study this summer, the trial by Cerulean Pharma. Fighting on . Dressed in a medical gown, Cossman awaits the CT scan. He's gently glided into the large tube. The tests take just a few minutes. He doesn't look for sympathy. He has no complaints about what he's been dealt. In fact, he celebrates life because ""it's been good to me."" His little girl was 5 when he was diagnosed. She's now 13. He says his doctor told him only 5 percent of cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them. He wants others who are suffering to be more proactive -- to ask their doctors about all their options. Slowly, he emerges from his CT scan. The waiting for results begins. He heads home. He tries not to get his hopes up. His phone rings after a few hours.  On the other end of the line, his doctor delivers the best news he's had in more than a year. His cancer has grown at a rate of 11 percent, enough to remain on the study. Yet the good news is only temporary. A few weeks later, blood shows up in Cossman's bladder and a new tumor is found on his back. His doctor advises getting him off the study. Cossman hopes to enter a new one soon. ""You're always on a roller-coaster when you have cancer. You have some successes and a lot of failures."" Does he still have the fight to live? ""Definitely,"" he says. CNN's Jarrett Bellini contributed to this report.","John Cossman has been battling cancer for eight years .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. chief made a landmark visit to Myanmar on Sunday, the latest high-profile official to descend on the nation as it undergoes economic and political reforms. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived during the day in Yangon, disembarking from a U.N.-designated plane to greet a number of people including Myanmar Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin. Ban is set to meet President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader who was subject to house arrest for years but recently won a seat in Myanmar's parliament. Speaking last week, Ban had said his visit comes at a ""critical moment"" for the South Asian nation, which is also known as Burma. ""Myanmar is only at the beginning of its transition,"" Ban said then. ""Many challenges lie ahead. Many concerns have yet to be addressed. Yet I am convinced that we have an unprecedented opportunity to help the country advance toward a better future."" The government's relationship with the international community is thawing after it started implementing economic reforms and opened up dialogue with the West and ethnic minority rebel groups. Ban applauded several recent reforms, including elections and steps toward reconciliation with the rebels and opposition movements. But he said more needs to be done. ""Now is the time for the international community to stand together at Myanmar's side,"" he said. ""Yet we also recognize this fresh start is still fragile."" The trip, which follows a series of political reforms in Myanmar, marks the latest step in the country's international rehabilitation after decades of isolation. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met with Suu Kyi on Saturday. Ashton will open a new embassy-level office for the European Union in Yangon to ""help support Myanmar/Burma on its path to full democracy."" Myanmar's authoritarian military rulers are loosening their grip on power after decades of stifling dissent and limiting freedoms. In the past 12 months, the government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a cease-fire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. Suu Kyi and 42 other candidates from her party won seats in elections on April 1, a result welcomed by the United States and Britain as a sign of progress toward democracy after decades of repressive military rule. After the elections, Suu Kyi and other newly elected opposition members were invited to attend a parliament session last week, but they demurred, requesting a change in the wording of the lawmakers' oath. The tension over the oath marks the first public sign of conflict between the opposition and the reformist government since the elections. Other high-profile visitors to Myanmar in recent months include British Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.","NEW: U.N.

"(CNN) -- With their billowing sails, towering masts and long wooden hulls, 19th century clipper ships were staggering feats of design -- and Europe's lifeline to the world's most exotic goods. Laden with spices, teas and chocolates from across the globe, the use of these wind-powered sailing vessels reached its peak during the late 1800's, a period often referred to as the ""Golden Age of Sail."" Abandoned in the advent of steamboats, the centuries-old transport is now enjoying a revival among cargo traders, with a new breed of merchant ships returning to wind power in an effort to promote environmentally sustainable trade. This week, the 32-meter brigantine Tres Hombres set sail from the Netherlands to the Caribbean in an eight-month voyage transporting ale, wine, rum and chocolate -- much the same way as merchant ships would have done 150 years ago. Named in honor of the three friends who founded the ambitious scheme, the 35-ton carbon-neutral vessel has no motor and relies on solar-powered fridges to keep its cargo cool. ""A lot of shipping companies are going bankrupt because fuel is so expensive,"" said one of the ship's founders and co-captain, Arjen van der Veen. ""The model we have now of shipping is unsustainable -- both for business and the environment. We chose a traditional rig because it's a beautiful design and we wanted to show people sailing can still be effective."" From its base in Den Helder in the Netherlands, Tres Hombres will head to Brixham in England where it will pick up 100,000 bottles of ale, delivering them to Douarnenez in France. From there it will sail to ports across Europe and the Caribbean, transporting 500 liters of wine, 50,000 chocolate bars, 4,000 bottles of rum and 5-tons of cocoa beans in a round trip. All the cargo is organic, making it eco-friendly from the moment it is produced to the moment it lands on the supermarket shelf, Van der Veen explained. ""The whole chain of production is sustainable,"" he said. ""For companies, it makes their goods unique. It's a little more expensive but people are willing to pay because it has no carbon footprint."" The Sail Transport Network (STN), a green travel campaign group, is now looking to create a sustainable transport certificate, much like the ""Fair Trade"" and ""Organic"" stamps found on other foods. STN founder Jan Lundberg predicts that wind-powered cargo ships will soon be the norm as the world's fossil fuel supplies continue to diminish. ""The accelerating rate of change in the economy and finance, the peak oil factor and the climate crisis are all tipping factors. If more people sense this soon, you could see a jump in sail transport investment,"" he said. ""Many smaller older cargo vessels are idle today and are also being recycled -- these are realistic candidates for conversion to sail."" Recent figures show there is much at stake when it comes to sustainable transport on the high-seas. Around 90% of world trade is currently carried by the shipping industry, according to the International Maritime Organization. The industry contributes 4% of global carbon emissions, United Nations figures show. Indeed, it says that if shipping were a country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. But it could be that the winds of change are on the horizon. From January next year, new International Maritime Organization regulations will require shipping companies to cut emissions by 20% over the next seven years and a further 50% by 2050. ""By 2025 all new ships have to be 20% more efficient, so shipyards will also be compelled to produce more fuel-efficient vessels,"" Simon Bennett of the International Chamber of Shipping said. ""What's also important is that fuel costs have risen 400% since 2000 -- the operating costs are huge. In any case, every shipping company wants to reduce its emissions."" With these environmental concerns in mind, Van der Veen and his fellow Dutch captains Andreas Lackner and Jorne Langelaan set about building the Tres Hombres in 2007, using the hull of a former passenger ferry in the Aran Islands off the coast of Ireland. Completed in 2009, this is Tres Hombre's fourth trade trip after previous voyages across western Europe, the Caribbean and even delivering relief aid to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. The trio are certainly not alone in their quest to find green alternatives to the gas-guzzling cargo vessels of the 21st century. British wind power company B9 recently tested a model of its planned 100-meter, 3,000-ton carbon-neutral freighter. The ship would use 60% wind power, relying on three computer-operated masts rising 55-meters -- as tall as a 14-storey building. This would be supplemented by a bio-gas engine converting food waste into methane; the food waste being anything from restaurant slops to out-of-date sandwiches. B9 co-director Diane Gilpin said the design would best suit smaller vessels, and they are now looking for between $30 million and $45 million in funding to get it off the ground. ""In the last 100 years we've been absolutely besotted with what oil can do for us,"" she said. ""Now we're running out of fuel and we have to be a little bit cleverer about how we deploy our ships."" She admits it will be a challenge changing the traditionally conservative shipping industry, but added: ""If we're looking at a new, green, industrial revolution, those early movers will benefit from being there at the outset."" As Van der Veen said when the Tres Hombres crew first floated the idea of a engine-less cargo ship: ""Everybody thought it was crazy but we've proved them wrong. ""It's so satisfying -- it's part of our goal to make a transport revolution.""","European merchant ships of the 19th Century were a lifeline to world's exotic goods .
