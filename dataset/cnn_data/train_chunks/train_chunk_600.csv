A 14-year-old Hartlepool pupil is officially the youngest football hooligan in Britain after he was slapped with a three-year banning order by magistrates. The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was grounded at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court after justices heard about a catalogue of disorder at matches. He is now barred from every single football stadium in England and Wales. The ban also means he must surrender his passport every time the England national team play abroad. Punishment: A teenage boy has been banned from every football ground in the UK following a series of incidents of football hooliganism. File picture . The Hartlepool United fan, who was part of a gang of young football hooligans 'intent on causing trouble and abuse at matches', was caught: . Detective Constable Jamie Smith, from Cleveland Police's Football Intelligence Unit, said: 'This means that this boy from Hartlepool is currently the youngest subject of a banning order in the UK. 'We applied for this ban as a preventative measure because we wanted to remove a 14-year-old that is keen on contributing to violence and disorder connected with football. 'Over the years Hartlepool has caused us very little problems because the majority of supporters go to enjoy themselves. 'It's unfortunate that we became aware, and are aware, of a small minority that go to games for confrontation rather than football.' Dale Jennings (left) celebrates a goal at Hartlepool's Victoria Park. The 14-year-old will not be able to attend a match for three years . The court heard how the teenager was caught misbehaving five times at separate fixtures in a 13-month period. He was spotted by police goading away supporters during one game at Victoria Park, and was then nabbed 'seeking disorder' after a planned confrontation with a gang of rival fans in Hartlepool town centre. Travel ban: The boy has to hand police his passport whenever England play abroad . The same yob was then caught at two more home games, once inside the stadium again goading visiting supporters and at another fixture when he was actively involved in trouble. He was also involved in trouble at a Pools away game where he taunted fans and shoppers as he made his way to the game. The town youngster appeared at court with his parents and apologised to the bench for his actions, saying: 'I'm sorry I won't do it again.' His father then added: 'He was caught up and easily led in a group of other youths when he used to go to football matches. 'Since he stopped going he's actually started knocking around, as the saying goes, with his schoolmates and his nose is now clean. 'I think it was a one-off thing.' Chairman of the bench Keith Gorton told the youth that he would be banned from all regulated UK matches and must not enter a relevant town or city where Pools are playing, or the area around Victoria Park, four hours before or six hours after a game. When England play games abroad he must also surrender his passport. 'We hope that, based on what your mum and dad have said, that this is something you can put behind you and that you are not led by other people in the future, and that we don't see you in court again,' Mr Gorton told him.","Teenager was involved in brawls and abuse towards rival fans .

His Honour Judge Simon Brown QC has been criticised by the Court of Appeal for copying large parts of his ruling from the closing submissions of one side in a £1.8m court case . A top judge has been reprimanded after he copied almost every word of a ruling which left a father and son ruined by a £1.8 million debt. Judge Simon Brown QC, who earns nearly £130,000-a-year for sitting on the bench, lifted 'word for word' chunks of one side's written arguments before condemning entrepreneur, Declan Crinion, and his elderly father, Tommy, to a life of penury. Underlining that 'appearances matter', the Court of Appeal laid into Judge Brown's plagiarism and warned that such 'thoroughly bad practice' must never happen again. Lord Justice Underhill said that 'almost all' of Judge Brown's ruling was 'taken word for word' from written submissions put in by financial brokers, IG Markets Ltd, who sued the Crinions after they lost a fortune gambling on derivatives at the height of the financial crisis. Dismissing the Crinions' appeal today, . Lord Justice Underhill ruled - 'not without some hesitation' - that, . despite his copying, Judge Brown, who earns a total of £129,579-a-year, had 'performed his essential judicial . role' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were 'sufficiently . apparent'. Despite 'a number of small verbal changes' made by the judge, the overall impression was that his decision was 'derived almost entirely' from IG Markets' closing submissions. The Crinions' lawyers had calculated that, when setting out the facts of the case, Judge Brown had used 'some 94 per cent' of the words originally drafted by IG Markets' legal team. There was also 'no alteration whatever to the structure'. The judge, sitting with Sir Stephen Sedley and Lord Justice Longmore, said: 'In my opinion, it was indeed thoroughly bad practice for the judge to construct his judgment in the way that he did.' By adopting IG Markets' arguments wholesale, Judge Brown had given the impression that he had not considered the case independently and even-handedly. Although there was 'nothing inherently wrong' in making use of such documents, Lord Justice Underhill said: 'I have never before seen a case where the entirety of the judgment has been based on one side's submissions in the way that occurred here'. Sir Stephen Sedley said the Crinions said they felt the judge had never properly engaged with their case or fairly considered their defence when it was heard at the Mercantile Court sitting at the Birmingham Civil Justice Centre. He added: 'The possibility of something approaching electronic plagiarism is new and it needs to be said and understood that it is unacceptable. 'Even if it reflects no more than the judge's true thinking, it reflects poorly on the administration of justice... appearances matter.' He concluded: 'I hope that a judgment like this one now before us will not be encountered again'. Sitting at the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Underhill dismissed the Crinions' appeal and said despite his copying, Judge Brown had 'performed his essential judicial role' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were 'sufficiently apparent' Those tough words will, however, come as . little comfort to the Dublin-based Crinions, after the court ruled . that, whatever his failings, Judge Brown had nevertheless reached the . right result and the pair could not be let off the hook. In his April 2012 ruling, Judge Brown had said that Declan Crinion, was 'charmingly frank about his addictive gambling nature and of his sad financial demise'. He claimed IG Markets had let him down and the judge observed: 'As he put it, with a humour evocative of W.C Fields, ""they should not open the bar and give an alcoholic the opportunity to drink more than was good for him"".' 'I have never before seen a case where . the entirety of the judgment has been based on one side's submissions in . the way that occurred here' - Lord Justice Underhill . But Judge Brown said both he and his . elderly father knew what they were getting into when they built up huge . positions in financial derivatives known as 'Contracts for Difference' (CFDs). Father and son had their accounts compulsorily closed down by IG Markets in February 2009, within months of the Lehman Brothers collapse, and were left holding debts totalling more than £1.8m. Declan argued that although he operated all the accounts personally, only one of them was his limited risk responsibility. He also claimed IG Markets had overestimated his sophistication as an investor and should have limited his losses by closing the accounts sooner. Tommy denied authorising his son to operate an account in his name - he said his signature on a crucial document had been 'forged' by his son - and both men argued IG Markets had failed to do enough to protect them as consumers. However, Judge Brown - who observed that his ruling would leave father and son 'with little or no assets' - said the brokers had been under no obligation to give them advice and they were sophisticated enough to understand the risks involved.","Judge lifted 'word for word' chunks of one side's written argument in ruling .

Jodi Arias' lawyer stands to make extra $200,000, paid for by taxpayer, because his bid to stop defending her was denied. The 32-year-old killed Travis Alexander her on-again off-again boyfriend in 2008 by stabbing him nearly 30 times, slitting his throat, and finally shooting him. She is represented by Kirk Nurmo who asked to be taken off the case, but his request was denied. Mark up: Jodi Arias' lawyer Kirk Nurmo stands to make extra $200,000, paid for by taxpayer, because his bid to stop defending her was denied . He already earns $225 an hour defending the convicted murderer, but will now earn extra $100 representing her due to his request being refused. The County Board of Supervisor's decided . to front the money in anticipation of his impending bill for his defense . of Arias, Maricopa County spokesperson Cari Gerchick told The Huffington . Post. He asked a second time on Monday after his request for a mistrial was denied by Judge Sherry Stephens - it was also denied. Mr Nurmi’s claimed that Arias has not received a fair trial because the jury was not sequestered and cameras were allowed in the courtroom. Still waiting: Jodi Arias, seen in court on Wednesday, is still awaiting a sentence from the jury who already declared her guilty of first degree murder . The county has spent about $1.7 million to date on Arias' defense, Ms Gerchick said. Meanwhile jurors in the murder trial resumed deliberations today after they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death for killing her one-time boyfriend, prompting the judge to instruct them to keep trying. The panel reported its impasse Wednesday after only about two and a half hours of deliberations. Judge Sherry Stephens told jurors to try to identify areas of agreement and disagreement as they work toward a decision. The jury then continued deliberating until late afternoon, when it adjourned for the day without a decision. Under Arizona law, a hung jury in the death penalty phase of a trial requires a new jury to be seated to decide the punishment. If the second jury cannot reach a unanimous decision, the judge would then sentence Arias to spend her entire life in prison or be eligible for release after 25 years. In the event of a hung jury in the Arias trial, the case could drag on for several more months, said former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley. 'If that happens, this jury would be dismissed and a second jury would be impaneled, and you'd literally have to go through the whole case again,' Romley said, adding the murder conviction would stand and the new panel would be considering only the sentence. However, the new jury would have to review evidence and hear opening statements, closing arguments and witness testimony in a 'Cliffs Notes' version of the trial, Romley said. Romley also noted that if the current jury deadlocks, the prosecutor could decide to take the death penalty off the table. If that happens, the judge would determine whether Arias spends her entire life in prison or is eligible for release after 25 years. The judge cannot sentence Arias to death. Murdered: Jodi Arias killed her on-off boyfriend Travis Alexander (left) in June 2008, stabbing him 27 times and shooting him in the head at his Mesa home . The panel heard emotional comments last week from Travis Alexander's family as the prosecutor argued Arias should be executed for his gruesome killing. Arias responded Tuesday by pleading for mercy, saying she can become a model prisoner by teaching inmates how to read and speak Spanish and helping the prison launch recycling programs. She also wants to be an advocate for domestic violence victims. The same jury of eight men and four women convicted Arias of first-degree murder two weeks ago. Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander about 30 times, shot him in the forehead and slit his throat in what authorities said was a jealous rage. Arias claimed it was self-defense. She spoke to media outlets in jailhouse interviews Tuesday night just hours after the jury began deliberations. She talked out about her murder trial, her many fights with her legal team and her belief that she 'deserves a second chance at freedom someday.' Arias said her lawyers let her down by not calling more witnesses who could have bolstered her claims that she was a victim of domestic violence at Alexander's hands. Following her conviction last week, Arias told a local TV station that she preferred the death penalty. However, she said Tuesday night that she changed her mind after a tearful meeting with family members, realizing her death would only cause them more pain. 'I felt like by asking for death, it's like asking for assisted suicide, and I didn't want to do that to my family,' she told the AP.","The 32-year-old killed Travis Alexander her on-again boyfriend in 2008 .

Gary Allen Irving, Massachusetts' number one most dangerous fugitive, is scheduled to appear at a Maine courtroom for the start of extradition proceedings this morning. He is being held after police finally tracked down the violent sex attacker to an address in Gorham, Maine, following a manhunt which has lasted for more than three decades. Justice: Gary Allen Irving, pictured last night (left) and in an old mugshot (right), was finally captured after spending 33 years and 260 days on the run after he was convicted of three rapes in Massachusetts . Officers from Massachusetts Violent Fugitive Apprehension Squad and the FBI pounced on a home at 9.15pm last night where he had been living under an assumed name. Officers and agents discovered a fearsome arsenal of weapons during the raid, including seven rifles, two sawn-off shotguns and a handgun, MyFoxBoston reported. Now in his 50s, Irving fled Massachusetts in 1978 after he was convicted of three violent rapes in Norfolk County and sentenced to life in prison. One of his victims was a girl of just 16. He had been on the run for 33 years, 260 days, and was the subject of numerous public appeals for information which could offer clues to his whereabouts. Comparison on his mug shot photos from now and from before he went on the run show how he has aged in that time - including growing a bushy beard. South Street, Gorham, Maine: Officers tracked down Irving to an address on this road, where they found him living with a family and in possession of a fearsome arsenal of illegal weapons . It is not clear how police were finally able to catch up with Irving, but a spokesman said he had been living with a family in South Street, Gorham, under the assumed name Greg Irving. Irving was being held overnight at a Maine courtroom before a scheduled appearance this morning to be arraigned as a fugitive. He is also likely to face federal charges for the possession of illegal firearms.","Gary Allen Irving was convicted of three rapes 33 years ago .

And Rob Keeling, 38, had to think extra quickly while helping his girlfriend Jodie Pointon, 31, when she went into labour in the couple's bedroom on Sunday night, because baby Archy had the umbilical cord wrapped around his tiny neck. But having already delivered Archy's brother Bobby on the family sofa in 2006, Rob, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was able to react calmly, carefully untying the cord and pulling Archy to safety. Rob Keeling with his sons Bobby, six, and new baby Archy, both of whom he delivered at home without paramedic assistance . Rob realised paramedics were not going to arrive in time after he dialled 999 when Jodie began having close contractions, and was forced to deliver 7lb 4oz Archy on the couple's bed at 11.10pm. The delighted father-of-two, said despite the hiccup with the umbilical cord, his latest delivery was much easy than the first. He said: 'Everything happened so quickly that I can't really remember much about it. Jodie said she wasn't going to make it to the hospital, so I just went into auto-pilot. It was all a bit of a shock. 'It took barely two minutes before Archy was out, the moment he popped out the paramedics were at the door. 'The first time it happened I was scared, but having been through that it wasn't so bad a second time. I never thought in a million years I would be delivering another baby!' The delighted father-of-two, said despite the hiccup with the umbilical cord, his latest delivery was much easy than the first . Jodie had been having contractions through the day and went upstairs to rest. Rob told her to let him know if anything happened but she had barely reached the top of the staircase when she shouted that the baby was coming. 'He came out so fast I just delivered him there and then on the bed,' Rob said. 'Then I saw that the chord was wrapped round his neck and I knew that was dangerous, I had to gently try and free him or he might have died. 'He's a beautiful baby, perfectly healthy despite me delivering him, but I'm just glad I had some experience in delivering him.'

You just get on with it. We were all fine afterwards and Archy has been really good.' Archy's grandmother Jill Mellor, 55, from Fegg Hayes, Northamptonshire, said: 'I'm dead proud of Rob - he did really well. There aren't many dads who can say they have delivered both their children.'

Two killers who carried out a 'cold . blooded execution' to settle a gangland feud in the family of celebrity . gangster Dave Courtney have each been jailed for a minimum of 31 years. Genson Courtney, 22, the stepson of . the author and bit part actor, was shot through the eye by uncle David . Pinto, 33, and Robert Bleach, 45, outside his girlfriend's flat. The victim had been threatening his . uncle and Pinto decided to eliminate him first. Mr Courtney was gunned . down outside his girlfriend's flat in Greenwich from a range of three . feet. Genson Courtney, the stepson of celebrity gangster Dave Courtney, right, was executed by his uncle David Pinto, who shot him through the left eye . It is believed that Pinto actually carried out the shooting and Bleach was the getaway driver. The pair denied murder, but were convicted by the jury and ordered to serve a 31 year minimum sentence. Jailing the pair today Judge . Wendy Joseph said: 'The jury convicted you both of participating in what . can only be described as the execution of Genson Courtney. 'This was a deliberate and calculated plan to take the life of another person. 'The plan involved the carrying of a . gun and ammunition in public to a densely populated area at a time of . day when there could have been other people around.' The court heard Genson Courtney was the son Jenny Pinto had before she married Dave Courtney. Robert Bleach (left) and David Pinto (right) were jailed for shooting of Genson Courtney, stepson of celebrity gangster Dave Courtney . Jennifer Courtney, the victim's mother and sister of Pinto, the man who killed his nephew . His stepfather has written several . books about his life of crime with some of the legends of the underworld . and has had small parts in several films. He called himself Dave Courtney OBE - . and joked that the initials stood for 'One big ego.' But he was in . financial difficulty at the time of the murder and as a result he had a . fight with Genson. The stepson had a long list of . convictions and was jailed for six years for rape in 2006. Some of the . jail time he served overlapped with his stepfather and they were allowed . to share a cell in Belmarsh. Genson told his relative in prison he . wanted to get physically bigger so he could rob drug dealers when he got . out in January 2011. He was making £1,000 a week dealing . drugs at the time of his death and had many enemies. Mr Courtney was . also training every day at his local gym and had bulked up his body . massively with steroids before he died. Three weeks before the murder he . argued with his stepfather about Dave Courtney's plan to build another . house in his back garden so that he would have somewhere to live if his . home was repossessed. Location: Jonathan Rees, QC, prosecuting, said Mr Courtney was shot as he was getting into his car outside his girlfriend's flat in Banning Street, Greenwich . The pair decided to settle their differences on Plumstead Common, south-east London. After being battered to the ground by his stepson, Dave joked: 'Let's call it a draw.' Genson Courtney also bore grudges against his uncle, who was wary of him because of the thrashing he had handed out to Dave Courtney. He was still angry with Pinto because he had thrashed him in front of his friends for playing truant as a child. Pinto had also taken some of Genson's belongings and pawned them to pay off a £1,100 debt the victim owed. The victim, who suffered from 'roid rage' believed Pinto was hiding from him and sent him a series of abusive texts before he died. Genson Courtney had left his girlfriend's flat and was going to sell drugs when he was shot at point blank rage in Banning Street, Greenwich on July 3, 2011. 'The shooting had the hallmarks of a coldblooded execution,' said prosecutor Jonathan Rees. 'The evidence suggests the gunman was lying in wait for Mr Courtney as he left his girlfriend's flat to get into her car which was parked on the road outside. 'The gunman managed to get very close to his target and fired only one shot to the head - it seems that a getaway car was waiting nearby.' He added: 'Genson Courtney was looking to settle various scores he had with Uncle David. 'Against this background the prosecution suggest that the motive behind the killing was that David Pinto was concerned that Genson Courtney was after him and sought to eliminate the threat he posed.' The evidence against the two men was purely circumstantial and the prosecution relied on mobile phone contacts put them in the area. Pinto, of Greenwich, and Bleach, of Greenwich, both denied murder. They showed no trace of emotion as they were sentenced via a court video link from jail.

Prime Minister David Cameron has been given advice by Twitter users about how to 'keep it real' David Cameron has tried to show he is a man of the people but ‘call me Dave’ was today told to ‘keep it real Dave’ by thousands of disgruntled Twitter users. A stream of messages have been posted on the social networking site offering humorous suggestions to the Prime Minister about how he should get back in touch with the general public. The Prime Minster has often said that he and the Government is battling alongside the rest of the country in its efforts to ride out the current economic crisis, but austerity measures have proved unpopular and embarrassing gaffs such as ‘pastygate’ have left voters questioning his integrity. Writing under the hashtag ‘#davekeepsitreal’, users poked fun at Mr Cameron’s wealth and ‘toff’ background. 'Margo' wrote that Dave should 'keep it real' by ‘sending a 'friend' request to John Prescott on Facebook!’ Mr Prescott, who started the hashtag, posted that the Prime Minister should ‘eat . caviar straight out of the tin’ and start ‘hanging out with northern . MPs…like Nick Clegg.’ User . David Townsend teased Mr Cameron for his recent claim that he shopped in . Sainsbury’s. Mocking the Witney MP he wrote: ‘I’m not a snob. My butler . has shopped at Tesco.’ Crumbling: David Cameron has come under fire for 'pastygate' when he claimed to have eaten a pasty from a branch in Leeds that doesn't exist . On the same theme Teacherdude commented: ‘His favourite song is the Hollies. ‘He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Butler.’ ‘The Hughes’ said the Prime Minister could regain public confidence by ‘paying for Special Brew on his platinum card.’ Mr Cameron has refuted suggestions that he is not in touch with the public and sticks by his famous ‘we’re all in this together’ slogan. However, ministers have recently been criticised over the way they dealt with the fuel strike threat and the handling of Abu Qatada's attempted deportation. Satirical comments about Mr Cameron from Twitter users continued to flood into the site throughout the day. Crumbling: David Cameron has come under fire for 'pastygate' when he claimed to have eaten a pasty from a branch in Leeds that doesn't exist . Chris Orton said the leader should keep it real by ‘visiting the city of Cambridge to see how the other half live in the north.’ Cameron Addicott said that DC could be 'down with the kids' by announcing that his favourite rappers are NWA – 'Nannies With Attitude.' Duncan Jefferies said the Prime Minister should refer to ‘guns as shooters’ when flogging arms to dodgy regimes.’ The comments comes in the wake of David Cameron's announcement yesterday that he wanted to ‘stay in touch’ with voters as he brushed aside claims that he was an ‘arrogant posh boy’. After a turbulent month he vowed to ‘learn some important lessons’ but his fightback was marred by an extraordinary attack on him and George Osborne by Tory MP Nadine Dorries who branded them ‘arrogant posh boys’ who ‘don’t know the price of milk’. In a separate blow to the Tories, a poll showed Mr Cameron’s three-point lead a month ago has been replaced by an eight-point lead for Labour. Mrs Dorries told the BBC’s Daily Politics show: ‘There is a very tight narrow clique of a certain group of people and what they do is act as a barrier and prevent Cameron and Osborne and others from actually really understanding or knowing what is happening in the rest of the country. ‘I think that not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don’t know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others – and that is their real crime.’ Mr Cameron sighed when Mrs Dorries’ remarks were read to him later. ‘Look, I don’t agree with Nadine. She’s . got a very strong view about a number of things, he said. ‘I go to . Sainsbury’s in Chipping Norton on a Friday or a Saturday. I do a lot of . the family shopping. Sam does a lot of it on the internet.’ Asked about the price of a pint of milk, he said: ‘I pay just under 50p.’ But in his most frank assessment of . the Government’s recent performance, the Prime Minister admitted: ‘There . isn’t a day in this job that I don’t learn some important lessons and . you’ve got to make sure you stay in touch and realise that as you get on . with it.’ David Cameron will try to avoid close dealings with tax-dodging businessmen in future, he pledged yesterday. The Prime Minister, whose party has been accused of being too close to the rich, said the Government was cracking down on individuals and businesses carrying out ‘aggressive tax avoidance’. When asked if he would try to avoid dealing with tax dodgers, he told the BBC: ‘Generally speaking, yes, I think that’s sensible.’ But he refused to comment on Sir Philip Green’s tax affairs – the billionaire retailer who was a Government efficiency adviser. Critics accuse Sir Philip of avoiding millions of pounds of tax by registering most of his business in the name of his wife Tina, who lives in Monaco. Mr Cameron said: ‘He came up with very sensible suggestions for how you could reduce costs in government and therefore reduce people’s tax liabilities.’ He suggested poor communication was to . blame for many of the Coalition’s recent difficulties – citing the fuel . strike, when ministers were accused of helping to trigger panic buying. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude called for voters to fill jerry cans with petrol and keep them in their garages. ‘Sometimes a presentational mistake . can be an important mistake,’ said Mr Cameron. ‘On the fuel strike issue . ...we have taken very effective action ... but did we communicate . perfectly at every stage? I think most people would say, “No you . didn’t”.’ Asked if he would apologise for the . Government’s role in causing chaos at the pumps, the Prime Minister . said: ‘The Government took the right action in terms of the resilience . of the country but we need to do better in terms of communication.’ Pressed again on whether he was sorry, he added: ‘Of course. Look, I’m . responsible in the end for everything the Government does, and if we . don’t get it right I’m very clear about that.’ In a separate interview, part of a . round attempting to draw a line under recent difficulties before local . elections next month, Mr Cameron conceded his Government must ‘raise our . game’. 'Raise the game': Mr Cameron conceded yesterday that the Government must do better as a poll put Labour support at a nine-year high of 41 per cent . ‘Everything we are doing is about . helping people who work hard and do the right thing and making this . country more pro-enterprise, more pro-get-up-and-go, more pro-work, more . pro-effort. The Prime Minister yesterday defended finding the time to have ‘date nights’ with wife Samantha and watch DVD box sets. Mr Cameron said he was ‘absolutely driven’ in his job, but insisted it was right to find time for his family. As polls show that support for the Conservatives is plummeting, some backbench Tory MPs have said Mr Cameron is too relaxed for his role. One Tory backbencher told the Financial Times that Mr Cameron was ‘putting the school run ahead of the national interest’. But Mr Cameron said that Prime Ministers who do not take time out from their jobs end up ‘completely fried and exhausted’ and make ‘bad judgements’. ‘That is the mission. You have difficult weeks or difficult months. I want us to raise our game and do better,’ he said. The Prime Minister dismissed claims . that he is too relaxed. ‘I may look relaxed but I don’t ever feel . particularly relaxed in this job,’ he said. However, a committee of MPs . will today give voice to criticism of Mr Cameron’s leadership style in a . report blaming a lack of strategic thinking for a series of policy . mistakes. ‘Policy decisions are made for . short-term reasons, little reflecting the longer-term interests of the . nation,’ MPs on the commons public administration select committee will . say. Former Cabinet Secretary Lord . O’Donnell, meanwhile, launched an extraordinary attack on ministers’ attempts to blame civil servants for some of their woes. ‘It doesn’t usually work, and I don’t think it will work this time either,’ he said. He also defended the right of Treasury . officials to offer potential tax changes to an number of different . administrations, following claims the ‘pasty tax’ and ‘granny tax’ – had . been rejected by previous Chancellors and ‘taken off a shelf’. ‘Just because one political party . doesn’t think something is a good idea doesn’t mean that a different . form of government might decide that they’ve got different political . priorities and might want to go with it,’ he said.Last night’s ICM . survey for the Guardian revealed support for Labour has reached its . highest level for nine years. Ed Miliband’s party has seen its poll . rating rise by four points in the past month to 41 per cent, a figure . last enjoyed by Labour during Iain Duncan Smith’s ill-fated leadership . of the Tories. Labour’s fortunes have risen as support for the Tories has fallen by six points to 33 per cent. Mr Cameron’s three-point lead a month ago has been replaced by an eight-point lead for Mr Miliband. Liberal Democrat support is unchanged on 15 per cent.","Thousands of Twitter users leave messages for David Cameron on social networking site .

From Lady Gaga's meat dress to necklaces made from pheasant's skulls, some designers use all sorts of weird and wonderful materials to create 'carcass couture'. And one Scottish design student is following suit by creating a handbag line from tripe in honour of one of Scotland’s most iconic creatures. Jocelyn Mather, 23, has crafted the unique and somehow luxurious collection of bags using the stomach lining of a Highland Cow – after realising how much of the animal goes to waste once it is slaughtered. Unique: Jocelyn Mather crafted the collection using the stomach lining of a Highland Cow - after realising how much of the animal goes to waste once it is slaughtered . Jocelyn, a 4th year studying at Edinburgh Napier University, said: '40 per cent of the animal is edible but a lot of the ""off-cuts"", like tripe are used for dog-food. 'A lot of abattoirs also sell the hides on to customers in Italy and I just thought, this is our national animal, why aren’t we more proud of it?!' Her four statement bags, which will go on display at the University’s Creative Degree Show from 24th May, were all hand stitched. The collection ranges from a formal clutch to a dainty handbag, with tripe either used as a lining or outer material. Creative: The budding designer hopes her creations go some way to make people think differently about animals . The fastenings are also made using the animal’s horns and bull-ring. 'My lecturer kept saying they would look great on Lady Gaga', said Jocelyn. 'It was really hard to get hold of tanned tripe so I attempted the tanning process myself in my bath. I had to leave the tripe soaking there for about a week before hanging it to dry on my clothes rack. My friends thought I was mad.' The talented student also hit a further hiccup along the way when her flat was raided by wildlife officers. 'My letting agent had been carrying out an inspection in my flat and had obviously come across a pair of cow horns', Jocelyn said. 'But he had thought they were ivory tusks and called the police! I was terrified, but they just laughed when they saw the horns.' Problematic: The talented student hit a hiccup along the way when her flat was raided by wildlife officers because her landlord found horns in her room . The budding designer hopes her creations go some way to make people think differently about animals. 'If each butcher was given one cow, one pig and one sheep to feed his local community every part of the animals would be used, but in this day and age of mass-farming that just doesn’t happen. 'I wanted to show more respect for this stunning animal by using its less palatable pieces to create something beautiful and unique.' On display: Her four statement bags will go on display at the University's Creative Degree Show from 24th May . Famous fan? Jocelyn's tutor says they would look great on Lady Gaga, who is know for her quirky fashion sense . Ian Lambert, Subject Group Leader: Art Design & Communication, said: 'Jocelyn’s designs are thought provoking and like much of the work set to go on show, executed to a high standard. 'This year, our students have created innovative and visually delightful projects and our Degree Show offers a fantastic showcase of Scotland’s next generation of creative talent.'

Students at Cambridge University have been outed as those who spend more on sex toys than at any other university, according to new figures. They topped a league table detailing sex spending at top colleges in the UK, while Oxford University came second. It has lead to speculation that students with a high IQs may also have high sex drives. 'High achievers aim for excellence in all areas of their life - including sexual happiness' Cambridge students spent almost . £9,793 on sex toys and soft bondage in the last year - which works out . at around 54p for each of the 18,000 students. Best selling products included rabbit vibrators and jiggle balls - popular for stimulating the G-spot. Oxford students splashed out £9,689 on sex toys - or 46p for each of its 21,000 students. They favoured more exclusive toys than Cambridge - spending almost three times as much on luxury vibrators. Manchester University lagged far behind our two elite universities in third place, spending just £5,441 in all on adult toys - almost half Cambridge’s total. The figures were released by Britain’s biggest online sex toy retailer, Lovehoney.co.uk. Cambridge students visited its site 5,995 times last year compared to 5,158 visits from Oxford and 3,905 from Manchester. The independence of a university lifestyle means that you can start to experiment with new things . High levels of sex toy spending appear to show a heightened interest in sex amongst Russell Group students . Famous Cambridge graduates include the supermodel Lily Cole and Carole Vorderman. The high levels of sex toy spending appear to show a heightened interest in sex amongst students in the Russell Group of elite universities - particularly Cambridge and Oxford. All bar three of the top 10 spending colleges are in the Russell Group. Five other Russell Group colleges made the top 20 - Nottingham (£2,811-12th ), Durham  (£2,451 - 15th), Bristol (£2,332 - 18th), Cardiff (£2,300 - 19th) and Exeter (£2,299 -20th) . A study of 2,000 female twins by researchers from King’s College in London found that those with higher IQs tended to orgasm more. Cambridge University graduate Alice Little, 27, who studied English at New Hall, said: 'It seems Oxbridge students know that sex and sex toys are the smartest way to relieve stress. 'Cambridge definitely has a work hard, play hard culture so it comes as no surprise Cambridge students spend the most to relieve the pressure of studying at a top university. 'High-achievers aim for excellence in all areas of their life, so it makes sense that achieving sexual happiness is one of their goals.' 'Cambridge has a work hard, play hard culture' Felix Hamer, studying at Keble College, Oxford, said: 'I think that intelligent people are more creative in the bedroom.' An unnamed 19-year-old female student studying English at Oxford said: 'When I came to university in Oxford, I was struck by how open everybody was about sex. 'Oxford sometimes has a bit of a stuffy, old-fashioned reputation but in terms of sexuality it's very liberal. 'The added independence of a university lifestyle means that you can actually start to experiment with new things. 'Although some people are still hesitant to discuss sex toys, they know that in such a liberal and friendly environment there isn't a stigma attached to enjoying sex with a partner or just by yourself.' Student spending on sex toys shot up following the publication of Fifty Shades Of Grey. It prompted thousands of students to experiment with sex toys and soft bondage, just as literature student Anastasia Steele does in the best-selling trilogy. Lovehoney co-founder Neal Slateford said: 'We are delighted that dreaming spires aren't the only phallic objects getting everyone excited in Cambridge and Oxford! 'It is interesting that spending on sex toys is far high amongst students at our elite universities. 'It's no bad thing if brainier people are randier, but we tend to find that everyone in the UK has become far more interested and relaxed about sex - not just our friends at Oxford and Cambridge.

Two muggers have been jailed thanks to a 'tracking' app used by police to trace an iPhone they snatched at knife-point. Ziggy Cawley, 19, and his 18-year old cousin Patrick grabbed the smartphone at knifepoint not realising their victim had earlier installed the free 'Find My iPhone' app as a security measure. Both were subsequently traced to a house 15 miles away after police were given log-in details of the missing mobile and activated the app using another device. Ziggy Cawley, 19, and his cousin Patrick, 19, were each sentenced to 40 months in prison for the mugging . iPhones can be protected by downloading the free tracking app 'Find my iPhone' During the search officers were able to send a message to the stolen phone which then pinpointed its exact location. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Ziggy of Bury, and Patrick, of Heywood, were each locked away for 40 months after admitting robbery. The phone was stolen when the Cawleys robbed three young people as they sat in a Seat car outside a McDonald's restaurant in Oldham last September 29. The Cawleys threatened the driver with a Stanley knife and forced the victims out of the car, then drove away with their phones. Officers tracked the GPS signal from the phone and found the Cawleys in the bedroom of a house in Bury. Both men were in bed when officers sent a message to the stolen iPhone 4 - which made a sound from a drawer in the room. Two other mobile phones stolen in the raid were also recovered by police. Detective Inspector Dave Massey, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'I cannot stress enough how important it is to get one of these apps in case your phone is stolen. 'It was crucial in finding these offenders and if the victim hadn't had the app, it would have been extremely difficult to trace these two men.' The Find My iPhone app is free to download from the App Store with an Apple ID. Users of the app can also install it on other iOS devices, such as an iPad, an iPod touch, or a Mac computer. The app can locate a missing device on a map, play a sound, display a message, remotely lock the device and erase all user data. The software can give driving directions to help the user travel to the location of their phone. Google has a similar app for Android phones, entitled 'Find My Phone' and Blackberry has created 'Blackberry Protect' for the same purpose.","Ziggy Cawley, 19, and his cousin Patrick, 18, stole iPhone at knife-point .

Tom Clarke, pictured, is on the hunt for his stolen iPad after receiving a series of bizarre pictures through the iCloud service within hours of it being taken . A software engineer is attempting to track down his stolen iPad - using photos taken by the thief who made off with the device. Tom Clarke's iPad went missing while he was Christmas shopping in Sussex, and he feared he would never see the expensive Apple tablet again. But after setting up an iCloud stream between his iPhone and the missing device, he has now received several bizarre clues as to the device's whereabouts. The 26-year-old has received a series of photos of a dog and a man posing in a woolly hat which were taken using the iPad's camera. And after the images were automatically streamed to his iPhone, he is now on the hunt for those who made off with the tablet. Among the pictures taken on his iPad were snaps of a pet dog and a man smirking while wearing a winter bobble hat. Numerous . pictures of the small brown dog were taken just two hours after Tom's . iPad went missing, prompting him to post on an internet forum in the . hope of tracking the thief down. A further cryptic clue as to the iPads whereabouts was received by Tom when the iCloud service showed him a picture of two pink suitcases being wheeled along by an unidentified figure. Tom realised the iPad was missing on December 19 and informed police within 24 hours. He then sent a message to the device to lock down the tablet and prevent anyone using it. Tom, from Goring, West Sussex, told Yahoo News: 'I . was away in Sweden on Christmas Day and I got two emails to say that the . message had been delivered and that the iPad was locked. In the frame: One of the pictures taken on Tom's iPad shows this hat-wearing man, who he thinks may know the thief in question . 'I thought at least they’ve seen the message and they might get in contact. Then as I was looking through my photos that day I noticed a picture of a dog, which I thought was a bit weird as I don’t have a dog.' Tom then discovered that he could not track down the location of the images, as the iPad's GPS had been turned off. He added: 'I don’t want to say it was . stolen as they may have found it on the floor of Tesco’s car park. I’m . not that interested in the person who has it, I just want the iPad back. Clues: Further evidence as to where the iPad might be came when Tom received photos taken on the device of a small brown dog, and two pink suitcases . 'The guy in that picture is not by any means a thief he just knows the person who has it”. 'It is just a really personal thing for someone to have in their possession with so many of my details and information on it.

Kyle Dube, of Orono, was charged in Nichole Cable's death after a body presumed to that of the girl was found in a wooded area Monday night, Maine State Police Lt.

Tyler-Ann Harris, a 16-year-old who described herself as Nichole's best friend, said Dube and Nichole had met a couple of months earlier and planned to see each other the weekend she vanished, before he had to report to jail for a 90 day sentence for a 2012 motorcycle chase. Harris, who met Nichole this year at Old Town High School where they were students, said she had never met Dube and wasn't sure of their relationship status. She said Nichole wasn't fearful of him. 'She was really happy even though she went through a lot of hard stuff in her life. She always knew how to see the bright side of things,' Harris said, using a tissue to dab tears in her eyes.

Although positive identification is pending, authorities believe the body is that of Nichole. Missing: Authorities believe they have found the body of Nichole Kristine Cable, 15, who has been missing since Sunday night . The body was being turned over to the medical examiner for positive identification and to determine a cause of death. Nichole's mother has said that she last saw her daughter on May 12 when she said she was going out to meet someone she knew from Facebook, but didn't know who that person was. She had pleaded for her daughter to come home, saying she won't be in trouble. Dozens of law enforcement officers, using aircraft and dogs, and hundreds of civilian volunteers have spent days searching for the teen, who lived in Glenburn. 'This initially started as a missing person's case and sadly it's transitioned to a homicide investigation,' said Penobscot County Sheriff Glenn Ross.

A lesbian was sacked by her boss the morning after a party at his house, a tribunal has been told. Rae Roberts, 19, went to Jim Cullen's house in Reading, Berkshire, with her partner, Jennifer Rowsell, who also worked for Cash Zone Ltd. The next morning Miss Roberts was called into Mr Cullen's office where she was sacked and Miss Rowsell quit soon after in protest at her girlfriend's treatment. Tribunal: Rae Roberts, left,  claims Jim Cullen, right, made offensive comments about her sexuality . Miss Roberts says Mr Cullen discriminated against her on grounds of her sexual orientation and claims that he threw a bin at her and called her an idiot. She said that her boss made offensive comments about her sexuality and her age and that her immediate manager, Abigail Peters, would leave abusive and demeaning notes about her performance on a weekly basis. Mr Cullen and Cash Zone Ltd deny any wrongdoing and claim Miss Roberts was dismissed because she failed to follow company procedures or take on board training. In her statement, Miss Roberts described receiving regular written and verbal abuse from Mr Cullen and Miss Peters, who constantly criticised the amount of work she did and its standard. She said she was criticised for being late and using Facebook despite claiming Miss Peters was sometimes several hours late and also used the website. The panel heard that her responsibilities included dealing with money transfers, valuations, buy-back procedures, processing cheques, testing gold, serving customers and even cleaning the branch office in Camberley, Surrey. She said: 'In September 2011 the second respondent (Mr Cullen) held a party at his home for all of the firm's employees. I and my partner Jennifer Rowsell attended the party. 'The next working day he came to the Camberley branch and said to me how disrespectful I was and how embarrassed he was of me because of how I and Jennifer Rowsell were ""all over each other"". 'I found his remark embarrassing, unfavourable and directed at my sexual orientation,' she told the tribunal sitting in Reading, Berkshire. Miss Roberts (right) said she was sacked the day after a party at her boss's house where he says she 'humiliated him' by being 'all over' her girlfriend (left) Miss Roberts worked at the Camberley, Berkshire, branch of Cash Zone in Camberley, Surrey . Dark-haired Miss Rowsell went further when she gave evidence later on, denying such activity had even take place. She said: 'I never really display any affection publicly. I would not display affection, especially with work people around.' Over the next few months, Miss Roberts said, the offensive notes continued with comments such as: 'You're a stroppy little teenager who has an attitude', 'I will depress you and ruin your holiday', as well as 'clean the f****** fridge' and 'clean the 'f****** microwave'. Then on January 28 last year Mr Cullen held another party at his house, which Miss Roberts and Miss Rowsell reluctantly attended. 'At one point when I, Abigail Peters and other girls were dancing, the second respondent (Mr Cullen) said to me: 'Don't get excited about dancing with other women',' said Miss Roberts. Mr Cullen and Cash Zone Ltd deny any wrongdoing and claim Miss Roberts was dismissed because she failed to follow company procedures . The tribunal heard that on March 30 last year Abigail Peters spilled some gold-testing acid onto her trousers. She pointed to the inside of her upper-thigh, showing it to Mr Cullen. He then said: 'Be careful. You may get Rae excited.' Rowan Morton, counsel for the respondents, said: 'Mr Cullen remembers, first of all, you were roaring with laughter and having a joke.' Miss Roberts said: 'That's incorrect.' A few days earlier, on March 23, Miss Roberts said she was called into Mr Cullen's office, where she said he shouted and swore at her for about 30 minutes, telling her: 'I bet you go home and cry to your mum, dad and Jennifer but they will not care or help you. You're a stupid kid.' She said he then grabbed his half-full bin and shouted: 'This is how you empty a f****** bin' as he picked it up. She began to leave the office after being told: 'Go on then,' and turned around just as the bin flew past her and smashed into the door. Miss Rowsell, who had worked in the firm's Bracknell branch, testified that she had seen Mr Cullen shouting and swearing at her partner on up to 10 occasions. She said Miss Roberts, who moved to the Camberley branch from Bracknell on July 18, 2011, had returned home in tears before and that she had encouraged her to look for other work and make a formal grievance but that Miss Roberts was sacked on April 16, 2012, before they could submit it. The claimant, of Brook Road, Camberley, said Miss Peters had requested the abusive notes back and that the record of their contents, which the firm had presented to the tribunal, was wrong. Miss Morton said Mr Cullen had never shouted at or sworn at the claimant but had always treated her with respect and supported her. She also said the gay couple had stayed the night at his home during the first party and that the flat they lived in was rented from him. The hearing continues.

A University of Rhode Island student on his way home to Pennsylvania for summer vacation vanished last week just 40 miles from his parents' home in a quiet suburb of Philadelphia. Matthew Royer, 21, was last seen about 2 a.m. Friday leaving a gas station near Allentown, Pennsylvania, just North of his family's home. He hasn't been seen or heard from since. Royer left the university about 6 p.m. Thursday, after text messaging his mother to say that he'd slept late and was getting ready to leave. Missing: 21-year-old University of Rhode Island student Matthew Royer disappeared while driving home to Pennsylvania early Friday morning . Surveillance footage from businesses along his route home and cellphone pings from nearby cell towers tracked his movements from Rhode Island to Pennsylvania. The last sighting of Royer was at the gas station near Allentown, where he bought a bottle of water. 'He bought water at the station, he opened it in the car and headed southbound on 100. He looked fine, not distraught,' his mother, Janet Royer, told ABC News' Philadelphia affiliate. Royer was scheduled to begin work at a local golf course on Friday morning. He never showed up, and his family reported him missing that afternoon. Pennsylvania State Police confirmed that Royer's vehicle - a silver 2008 Chevy Cobalt with Pennsylvania tags GZR-9059 - was spotted about 1 p.m. Friday on Route 501 and Route 422 in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. It's not clear whether Royer was in the vehicle. 'You couldn't ask for a better son': Royer's family says he has no reason to runaway and is generally a good kid . Royer had moved most of his belongings out of his apartment near the University of Rhode Island a few weeks prior to his disappearance. But his family says he still had some items packed in his vehicle when he disappeared, including a laptop computer and other electronic devices. Royer's family says he has a good relationship with everyone, and would have no reason to run away. 'We've narrowed it down to 30-40 miles from our house, and we can't find him,' Janet Royer told ABC. 'You couldn't ask for a better son. It's not like him. If he wasn't coming home, he would've told me he wasn't coming home, unless he couldn't.' Royer is described as white, 6-feet-1, and weighs 160 pounds. He has brown hair and blue eyes.Authorities are asking anyone with information to call Pennsylvania State Police Skippack at 610-584-1250 and give the reference number K03-1918501.","Matthew Royer was last seen about 2 a.m. Friday just 35 miles from his parents' home .

The misery of sticking-out ears is not just a schoolyard problem – the taunts and teasing can last a lifetime, and both children and adults with prominent ears often feel unhappy and self-conscious. But a pioneering new procedure can put an end to the torment, using an implant inserted under local anaesthetic that corrects the ears’ prominence in just 15 minutes. Such remarkable results are usually achieved only through invasive ear surgery – known as conventional otoplasty – in which the cartilage is cut. This procedure lasts 90 minutes and is undertaken under general anaesthetic. Fifty-four British patients have now been treated with the earFold implant, which gives instant results and dispenses with the need for heavy bandaging. Patients can return to work the next day. Before and after: Jeremy Wood, from York, North Yorkshire, pictured left 15 years ago with his daughter when his ears still protruded, and right after successfully undergoing the new procedure . One of the first to have benefited from the procedure is Jeremy Wood, 53, a senior valuer for auction house Bonhams in York. ‘I inherited my sticking-out ears from my father and was called bat ears by the boys at school,’ he recalls. ‘I have felt self-conscious about them all my adult life. ‘Strangely I’ve minded more as I’ve got older, maybe because you notice it more as you get balder. But I never considered surgery until I heard about the implant. ‘My daughter has the same ears as me, and had traditional otoplasty surgery on the NHS at the age of ten. It was quite traumatic and she still suffers from increased sensitivity around her ears, four years on. But this sounded incredibly simple so it appealed.’ It was the risks associated with otoplasty that drove plastic surgeon Norbert Kang to develop the implant. ‘I’ve been performing standard ear correction surgery for more than 15 years,’ he says. ‘It is very time-consuming and carries the same serious risk associated with all general anaesthetic. I felt there must be a safer, simpler method.’ The new earFold implant is a curved strip of flexible metal that is placed under the skin on the front of the ear. It works by gripping the cartilage and folding it back into a predetermined shape, pulling the ear closer to the head. About ten per cent of the population – six million people – have protruding ears, defined as sticking out by more than 2cm. But only one to two per cent of people are unhappy with their ears. Quick and easy: The new pioneering treatment, shown above, can be completed in just 15 minutes . ‘Protruding ears are an aesthetic issue so very much in the eye of the beholder,’ says Mr Kang. ‘But up to a million people dislike their ears and improving their appearance can be life-changing. The problem really affects self-confidence – I hope that those put off by conventional surgery might consider the implant.’ Another major advantage is that patients can specify how they want their ears to look and know what results to expect. Mr Kang says: ‘Before the operation they tell me what they want and I take a sizer – a curved piece of metal the exact size and shape of the implant – and put it on the ear over the skin. I move the sizer around until the ear looks the way the patient desires, then mark its position on the skin.’ Once this is agreed, a local anaesthetic is injected and a small cut (5-10mm long) made on the front of the ear, just inside the outer rim. The implant, which is just 15mm long and no thicker than a human hair, is then slid into the incision. ‘The implant is made from nitinol – the same alloy used in dental braces – which is super-elastic but always returns to its preprogrammed shape,’ says Mr Kang. ‘That means the ear can still move naturally but will revert to the corrected position.’ The cut is then closed with two absorbable stitches, which drop out naturally a couple of weeks later. About 60 per cent of people need two implants – one at the top and one halfway down – which are placed at the same time. Although pain and swelling can last up to two weeks, no follow-up treatment is required. Jeremy says: ‘It was a little sore for a few days afterwards but that was it. I was astonished.’ For the first few weeks, patients are advised to avoid contact sports and take sensible precautions to avoid their ears being hit. Earrings should also be avoided. ‘If someone is not pleased, we can adjust the implant under local anaesthetic,’ says Mr Kang. The earFold is plated with 24-carat gold to reduce its visibility under the skin and can be left in place indefinitely. However, research suggests that after a year, the ear may retain its new shape even if the implant is removed. The procedure is currently only available at the Royal Free Hospital in London for private patients.","Pioneering new procedure uses an implant inserted under local anaesthetic .

And now Cheryl Cole can add another string to her bow because she has been voted as having the world's best smile - even outshining the Duchess of Cambridge and Hollywood A-lister Angelina Jolie. The former Girls Aloud singer's dazzling white teeth and wide, confident smile see her top a poll of our favourite celebrity grins. Say cheese: Cheryl Cole has been voted as having the world's best smile . The 29 year old's mega-watt red carpet beam has won the hearts of one in five Britons (18 per cent), a study found. The Duchess of Cambridge and This Morning's Holly Willoughby finished second (14 per cent) and third (13 per cent) in the poll for their pearly white grins. The beautiful Brits beat hot Hollywood actresses Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie and Cameron Diaz. Psychologist Emma Kenny reveals how Cheryl's broad smile proves especially popular because it looks so welcoming and open. Runners up: The Duchess of Cambridge and This Morning's Holly Willoughby, finished second (14 per cent) and third (13 per cent) in the poll for their pearly-white grins . She said: 'We all make very fast judgements of each other based on a smile - we know from research that clean, white teeth are an integral part of that. 'Cheryl Cole is likely to have achieved a high score here because she has a wide, confident smile. 'In human communication terms, this suggests openness and confidence.' Although the census highlights how important healthy teeth and gums are to Brits, it also uncovered flaws in the way we care for them. Three-quarters of us don't brush for the recommended two minutes twice a day (75 per cent) and the same amount don't floss daily (73 per cent). Top spots: The beautiful Brits beat hot Hollywood actresses Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie and Cameron Diaz . Sugar is one of the main causes of tooth decay, yet one in five Brits (21 per cent) confess they eat more sugary snacks when feeling stressed. An unhealthy nine per cent turn to alcohol, six per cent drink more caffeine and seven per cent smoke more than usual under pressure, figures show. Cheryl Cole (18 per cent)Kate Middleton (14 per cent)Holly Willoughby (13 per cent)Julia Roberts (12 per cent)Angelina Jolie (five per cent)Cameron Diaz (four per cent)Emma Watson (four per cent)Tulisa Contostavlos (two per cent) All these factors are bad for our teeth and could stop us matching Cheryl's smile, found the study by Listerine. Nutritionist Amanda Hamilton added: 'It seems sugar is our crutch of choice, especially when we're stressed and because we lead increasingly stressful lives, we're eating more of it than ever before. 'This has an obvious impact on your teeth. 'Just like other crutches we have for stress such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, it's worth remembering that a short-term boost can have a long-term impact - in this case, on your smile.' It has also been discovered that it’s not wobbly body parts gnawing at a quarter of the nation’s confidence, but their crooked smiles – resoundingly beating concerns about bottoms, legs, hair and chests. And it seems that a healthy set of teeth is important because, according to a study by Invisalign, three quarters of Brits rated a person’s smile as important when first considering going on a date with them. They also found that crooked teeth would put over a quarter of people off dating someone, a much bigger turnoff than wrinkles and 50 per cent of people surveyed believe that straight teeth reflect how much pride you take in your overall personal hygiene.","Cheryl beat Duchess of Cambridge and Angelina Jolie to top spot .

A teenager who suffered severe head injuries in a horror crash has stunned medics by coming back from the dead. Nathan Gardiner was on a caravaning holiday in Northumberland when he was hit by a van. The 13-year-old was placed into an induced coma for two weeks, where his body was kept alive with a network of tubes and ventilators. His head injuries were so severe, his family were told there was little chance he would survive and were told by doctors to say their final goodbyes as he lay unconscious in Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary's critical unit. But Nathan defied medics to make a miracle recovery and, after three months in hospital and a further six months of rehabilitation, he is on the road to recovery. Nathan, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, was knocked down on August 24 last year as he crossed Lintonville Terrace in Ashington, Northumberland. He was taken to Wansbeck Hospital in Ashington before being transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. A huge section of his skull was cut away by surgeons leaving a patchwork of stitches as they tried to ease the pressure on his brain. Nathan's mum Anita, 37, who works in the adult social services department at Gateshead Council, said: 'They said they had done all the surgery and they didn't know if he was going to pull through. 'That's not something you expect to hear. 'It was devastating. You don't want professionals to tell you that they can't save your boy - your world just scrambles. 'We had to bring his brother James in because they told us to say goodbye. 'They said they didn't think he was going to make it through the weekend.' Nathan had been in Northumberland with his grandmother Margaret Gardiner, his uncle, Neil Gardiner, and his brother James, eight, on a caravaning holiday. Despite his condition, Nathan staged a remarkable fight for life and was slowly weaned off medication and brought out of his coma. A huge section of his skull was cut away by surgeons leaving a patchwork of stitches as they tried to ease the pressure on his brain . The teenager was so ill when he left hospital that his family placed a hospital bed in their living room so he could continue treatment. In February, Nathan returned to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where he underwent a four-hour operation to fit him with a titanium skull. His movement on the left-hand side of his body is still affected and he has started a phased return to school. Anita said: 'He's feisty like me. One of my colleagues from work, Jamie Scorer, did the Great North Run and he put Nathan's name on his shirt. 'When he finished he gave Nathan his medal. 'We've had incredible support from everyone, from work, from people on the estate, from people we know from the caravan. They've been wonderful.'

Police launched an investigation into the accident but they took no further action against the driver. Now Nathan's family have enlisted the help of a legal team from Irwin Mitchell in a bid to access vital funds which will ensure their son can get the best rehabilitation he needs. Anita said: 'I'm thankful every single day that he's still here. But there's still a part of you that grieves for what he was like.

Anita is hoping to trace witnesses who can help piece together how the accident occurred. Fran Mayes, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'It's been a traumatic eight months for Nathan and his family but any information people might have about how the accident happened could prove vital in our efforts to secure the support Nathan will need.'","Nathan Gardiner, 13, left with severe brain injuries after he was hit by van .

Andy Carroll is expected to join West Ham on a permanent deal after Liverpool agreed to take a £20million loss on the striker. While Carroll is yet to say yes to the move, West Ham have had a bid of £15m agreed in principle by Liverpool for a forward who cost a record £35m for a British player when he signed from Newcastle in January 2011. Carroll is believed to be keen on moving to Upton Park but the club want a definite answer from him by the end of next week. London calling? Andy Carroll could move permanently to West Ham after the club agreed a fee with Liverpool . The 6ft 3in Carroll yesterday pulled . out of England’s squad for the friendlies against the Republic of . Ireland and Brazil because of injury. He had been recalled by head coach Roy . Hodgson last week but suffered a  heel problem in the Hammers’ final . game of the season against Reading. Scans have shown he needs complete . rest. Hodgson was keen to use the friendlies to take another look at . Carroll, who has been in outstanding form for West Ham during the last . few weeks of his season-long loan under Sam Allardyce. The Hammers boss admitted at the . weekend that signing Carroll had become his top priority after his . partnership with midfielder Kevin Nolan flourished. Liverpool have reluctantly agreed to sell Carroll but Brendan Rodgers does not believe the target man has a future at Anfield. He struggled to make an impact after he was signed when Liverpool wanted a replacement for Fernando Torres. Cooled off: Newcastle had previously shown an interest in bringing Carroll back to the North East . Although his initial £65,000 a week . salary was comparatively low, his transfer fee for an unproven Premier . League player was incredible at the time. He scored only four goals for . Liverpool in the Premier League and has spent the majority of this . campaign on loan with the Hammers. Although the West Ham board have reservations about his injury record, they are determined to back Allardyce’s transfer plans. Carlton Cole looks set to leave West Ham after saying goodbye to the fans on Twitter. ‘Life is filled with ups & downs . today is a down but i’ll be back! Carlton Cole/CFC as i have been called . has left the building. i want to thank  the West Ham fans for their . support especially the 1’s who  made the away games feel like  a home 1. #COYI’ West Ham have agreed to sign Romania . defender Razvan Rat on an initial two-year deal when his contract with . Shakhtar Donetsk expires on July 1. The 31-year-old left back has 88 . caps. The Hammers have also held talks with AC Milan’s out-of-contract captain Massimo Ambrosini, who will be 36 next week. Meanwhile, Carroll has pulled out of . England's international friendlies with Brazil and the Republic of . Ireland suffering a heel injury. Kop that: The Newcastle-born striker was set to return to his parent club after a year on loan in east London . Sportsmail understands the striker will be out for at least six weeks. The Three Lions are scheduled to face the Republic of Ireland on May 29 at Wembley followed by a game with Brazil in Rio on June 2. Roy Hodgson, who named his squad last Thursday, will now have to manage without the services of Carroll who ended the season as West Ham's second top goalscorer with seven league strikes to his name. Hodgson is treating the matches as dress rehearsals for September's World Cup games against Moldova and Ukraine. He said: 'Everything I do will have an eye on the qualifiers.' England expects: Carroll has pulled out of the national squad to take on Brazil and the Republic of Ireland . But Carroll becomes the latest . high-profile player to pull out a squad that is already without captain . Steven Gerrard and Arsenal's Jack Wilshere - possibly the side's two . most influential players. Jack Rodwell was added to the England squad on Monday after the Manchester City midfielder scored twice in his side's disappointing 3-2 defeat at home by Norwich. He appears to have sufficiently impressed manager Hodgson to have earned a late call with Tom Cleverley a significant doubt in an already understrength squad. Beyond Michael Carrick and Frank Lampard, the team will severely lack top-level experience in midfield.","East London club agree deal believed to be in region of £15m to sign striker on permanent basis after successful loan spell .

When Misty the pit bull went missing, her owners used bacon to help the puppy - who was rescued from being used as bait by a dog-fighting ring - find her way home. Misty had been missing since Friday, after slipping out of her collar as she played in the Riverdale, New Jersey garden of the woman who is fostering her while she waits for her forever home. Erin Early-Hamilton, who has been fostering Misty, began a frantic search for the dog.  A $2,000 reward was offered to help track her down, hundreds of flyers were put up around the neighborhood and the nearby animal shelters and dog pounds were alerted. Homeward bound: Misty is given a big welcome by Erin Early-Hamilton and her husband after coming home . A fundraiser to help pay for the search costs also attracted $4,570 in donations from concerned well-wishers, many of whom have watched the puppy's progress after she was found dumped on a Brooklyn street with appalling injuries. However, nearly four days after she went missing, Misty followed her nose home after Mrs Early-Hamilton cooked up some bacon in the hope of attracting her. Dogs have an incredible sense of smell and there are many cases of lost dogs being able to sniff their way back home or follow a strong scent. Mrs Early-Hamilton, who is a vegan, . was so worried about her missing dog that when someone suggested cooking . bacon in the garden, she jumped at the idea. She had been sitting in a . chair with her hands on her head, when her husband, who was cooking up the bacon, told her their plan had worked. 'The whole thing is unbelievable,' Mrs Early-Hamilton said, as she recalled the moment the puppy wandered back into her garden. Relief: Misty's foster owner's cry and hug the pit bull as she returns after going missing for four days . 'I screamed,' she told NJ.com. 'It was a . yelp that just came out of me.

Despite going missing on Friday afternoon, the puppy was in good health by the time she found her way home on Monday afternoon. 'It's amazing,' Jackie O'Sullivan, a partner at Second Chance Rescue, said. It is thought Misty escaped after chasing after a bird. 'The area where she went is really, heavily wooded,' Ms O'Sullivan said during the search operation. 'We're just hoping she's hiding out or that someone might have her in their home already.' Misty has a large fan base after the story of her rescue was widely reported. When she was taken in by Second Chance Rescue, she was covered in infected wounds and bite marks. Ms O'Sullivan told the Daily News she hopes Misty's story will help raise awareness about the problems of illegal dog fighting. Her plight touched the hearts of pupils at the Stephen Gaynor School in Manhattan, who raised $800 through cake sales to help with her treatment. Abused: Misty was dumped on a Brooklyn street corner after being used as bait in dog fighting . Second Chance: The nine-month-old pit bull is recovering from her ordeal and waiting to be adopted . 'Pit bulls are often victimized,' Dr. Kim Spanjol, the school's counselor, said. 'The kids want to do everything they can to show people that pit bulls are also sweet and loving dogs and Misty is a perfect example of that.' Dog fighting is a felony offense, but the cruel 'sport' still takes place with street fights a particular problem in cities. Breeds such as pit bulls are bred to be aggressive and weaker dogs, such as Misty, are often used to encourage the fighting dogs in training sessions. As news that Misty was home and safe, more than 1,400 well-wishers from as far afield as Vancouver, California, Utah and Texas took to the Misty's Journey Facebook page to welcome her back. In a message posted on her Facebook page, Misty's foster owner's announced the creation of Misty's Mission, Donations from the search fund will be used to set up the mission to pay for the treatment of the next dog saved from being used as bait in fighting.","Misty follows her nose home in New Jersey four days after going missing .

A mother says she is a 'ticking time bomb' after being diagnosed with a rare condition that condemns her to living with eight tumours. Derrie Tustin, 25, has five non-cancerous tumours in her brain and three on her spine - and doctors have warned her that more could develop at any time. Ms Tustin, from Worcester, was diagnosed with life-threatening condition neurofibromatosis type two (NF2), which causes nervous system tumours. Derrie Tustin (pictured with son Kai, 4) has neurofibromatosis type two which causes tumours to develop in the nervous system . NF2 causes tumours that grow on the . nerves responsible for hearing and balance - causing symptoms including . hearing loss, tinnitus and balance problems. Tumours can also develop inside the brain or spinal cord and in the nerves to the arms and legs. These can cause symptoms such as weakness in the arms and legs and persistent headaches. Ms Tustin said: ‘The condition makes me a ticking timebomb, really. The tumours can flare up any time, any day, for the rest of my life - that's something I can never escape from. ‘Doctors keep an eye on the tumours but it's just like playing Russian roulette - you just don't know what will happen next. ‘It's made me a lot a stronger but each appointment is nerve-racking to say the least. I never know if I'm going to come out being diagnosed with potentially fatal cancer. Ms Tustin (pictured with her mother, Jennie) currently has five tumours in her brain and three in her spine but doctors have warned her that more could develop at any time . Ms Tustin has been told that there is a 50 per cent chance that her son Kai will have inherited the genetic mutation that causes the tumours to develop . NF2 is caused by a genetic mutation and in half of cases the mutation is passed from parent to child. On other occasions, such as in Ms Tustin's case, the mutation develops on its own in a child with no family history of the condition. There is no cure for NF2 so treatment involves managing the symptoms as they occur - for example, surgery can be used to remove tumours but it can cause deafness or facial weakness. She has had surgery to remove a lump from her ear but she now has to decide whether to have one of her brain tumours removed and risk deafness . Prognosis for NF2 patients varies significantly as some people's symptoms get worse rapidly while in others the condition progresses slowly. The average life expectancy for someone with the condition is 65. Ms Tustin was devastated to learn that she might have passed the condition onto her four-year-old son Kai, but she will have to wait until he is 18 before doctors know if he has inherited it. She said: ‘It's a condition that affects one in 35,000 people - now I know what I'm facing and I hope to raise awareness about it. ‘My son has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it. I have to wait 15 years until I know if I've given to my son - that's something no parent should face. ‘I won't be having any more children unfortunately, I can't face passing it on.’ Ms Tustin now faces the difficult decision of whether or not to have a fast-growing tumour removed from her brain. The surgery would leave her deaf in her left ear but without it she will require monthly treatment. She has already had a lump removed from behind her ear. She said: ‘At the moment I'm swaying more to towards the treatment as it's such a drastic change to lose my hearing. ‘The medical staff will keep tabs on the growth rate of the tumour. It's something I'm going to have with me for the rest of my life. Time is of the essence so I will be making the decision as soon as I can really. ‘When I first heard about it I had no idea what it was but I've had so many people wish me well - I just want to help raise awareness for it and encourage others to have the tests.’ Ms Tustin's fiancé, Mike, and her mother, Jennie, have supported her throughout the ordeal - going to every scan, medical appointment and treatment session. Ms Tustin said: ‘I only found the tumour after I felt a lump behind my ear. It was terrifying; the thought of having cancer it just hits you. ‘My family have been there for me at every waking moment. People know I'm strong and determined and just deal with it.’ NF2 is a gene mutation that causes tumours to grow on the nerves responsible for hearing and balance. These cause symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus and balance problems. Tumours can also develop inside the brain or spinal cord and in the nerves to the arms and legs. These can cause symptoms such as weakness in the arms and legs and persistent headaches. The tumours are normally non-cancerous. NF2 is caused by a genetic mutation and in half of cases the mutation is passed from parent to child. On other occasions the mutation develops on its own in a child with no family history of the condition. There is no cure for NF2 so treatment involves managing the symptoms as they occur - for example, surgery can be used to remove tumours but it can cause deafness or facial weakness. Prognosis for NF2 patients varies significantly as some people's symptoms get worse rapidly while in others the condition progresses slowly. The average life expectancy for someone with the condition is 65. NF2 affects about one in every 35,000 people.

A new mother whose life was saved by an emergency Caesarean section almost died after her wound became infected by a deadly bug. Katy Yates developed the life-threatening high blood pressure condition pre-eclampsia eight weeks before her due date which put her life, and that of her unborn baby, at risk. Medics safely delivered the 32-year-old’s daughter, Phoebe, but Mrs Yates developed a rare flesh-eating bug and was left fighting for her life. Katy Yates (with husband Steve) had to have daughter Phoebe by emergency C-section after developing the high blood pressure condition pre-eclampsia . Surgeons removed 6lb of flesh from her stomach in a bid to stop the bug spreading and she managed to fight off the infection. Mrs Yates, from Oswestry, Shropshire, said: ‘I was in agony but put it down to having surgery. I'd never had a caesarean section before so I didn't know what to expect. ‘I couldn't walk and had a raging fever. ‘Antibiotics didn't work so they had to cut the infection out. I was left with a gaping hole. ‘It's taken me a long time to recover – not just physically but emotionally. ‘I would go through it again to get to this point.’ Mrs Yates and her husband Steve, 31, . spent five years trying for a baby before she conceived thanks to the . fertility drug Clomid. She had to be closely monitored during her pregnancy after a scan showed her baby was not growing at the rate it should be. While Phoebe was delivered safely, Mrs Yates then went on to develop a rare flesh-eating bug and was left fighting for her life . Surgeons removed 6lb of flesh from her stomach in a bid to stop the bug spreading and she managed to fight off the infection . The couple, who both work for their family's gift experience company, were dealt another blow when doctors discovered an abnormality of the umbilical cord, putting their baby at a greater risk heart defects. Then, at 32 weeks, Mrs Yates was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and rushed to theatre for an emergency Caesarean section. The a development manager, said: ‘We'd just come back from a weekend away and had gone in for a routine check-up. ‘I never expected I'd be having my baby but the pre-eclampsia developed very fast. ‘It was a case of: “You are in danger. We need to get this baby out now”. Phoebe had to be taken to Shrewsbury Hospital's special care baby unit for treatment immediately after her birth . Necrotising fasciitis is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. It can destroy skin, muscles and fat. It develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. ‘I was very poorly. They were giving me so many drugs to stop me having fits.’ When Phoebe was born she was . immediately transferred to the special care baby unit and kept in an . incubator because she was so small. Mrs Yates said: ‘I didn't even get to hold her. I got to give her a kiss and that was it. ‘I was still really ill so I couldn't . go and see her. My blood pressure couldn't be controlled so I had to . have a nurse sit with me all the time. ‘In the evening, they wheeled her down for a few minutes and I got to have my first cuddle.’ After four days, Mrs Yates condition . had not improved but she was keen to be discharged so she could spend . time with her new daughter. Doctors at Shrewsbury Hospital agreed on the condition that she returned for daily check-ups. Mrs Yates said: ‘I still felt horrendous. I was sweating but I was freezing cold. ‘I had a dressing on my wound and noticed it had a foul smell. I had black bruising on my tummy. ‘I was in excruciating pain. I assumed I'd get better but it was getting worse and worse. ‘I couldn't walk and had to use a wheelchair.’ After being examined by a concerned midwife she was readmitted to hospital. At . first, medics ruled out the flesh eating bug necrotising fasciitis but . luckily another doctor spotted the signs and diagnosed her. In the days after Phoebe's birth, both mother and daughter were fighting for their lives . The bug is caused by bacteria releasing toxins into the skin and muscle, forcing it to waste away. Following . the diagnosis Mrs Yates was rushed into surgery where the infected . flesh was cut away in an attempt to control the infection and stop it . spreading. She said: ‘I remember them telling me I had to go to theatre and panic set in. ‘They asked me if I wanted to go see . Phoebe but I couldn't even move. Looking back, they probably said that . because they thought I wouldn't survive. ‘After the operation, a doctor said . if I hadn't been young and healthy I wouldn't have made it. My organs . were shutting down and I'd not got much longer. ‘I didn't see Phoebe for a week. Steve had to split in two - going back and forth between us.’ Mrs Yates, who needed a further three operations, spent three weeks in hospital on powerful antibiotics. Doctors told Mrs Yates (with Phoebe, now two) that she only survived the flesh-eating bug because she was young and healthy . Mrs Yates, who needed a further three operations, spent three weeks in hospital on powerful antibiotics. She is now worried the large scar caused by the C-section and bug will prevent her from having more children . She was also fitted with a vacuum pump to remove fluid from her wound and reduce the risk of the infection returning. She said: ‘It should have been the happiest time of my life but it ended being the most traumatic. ‘When Phoebe came home a week after me, I couldn't care for her. I had to have somebody with me all the time. ‘As a mum you want to do it yourself, not watch someone else change your baby's nappy. ‘I couldn't bend to pick her up for several months - even holding her was difficult. ‘It meant I struggled to bond with her for a long time. I needed counselling. Mrs Yates said: 'Before I had Phoebe, I had no idea of the risks of necrotising fasciitis It's more common than women realise' ‘Even now my back hurts when I pick her up because it has weakened the muscles in my stomach. ‘I still get pain from the scar and I have to be careful when Phoebe jumps on me.’ The couple hope to try for another baby in the future but are unsure how Mrs Yates’ body will cope during pregnancy because of the large scar. Mrs Yates, a trustee of the Lee Spark Necrotising Fasciitis Foundation has raised £8,000 for the charity and is now making training DVDs to help maternity staff spot the signs for post-natal infections. She said: ‘Before I had Phoebe, I had no idea of the risks. It's more common than women realise. ‘Fast diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis is imperative to survival. It can kill within 24 hours. ‘If I can help one woman it would make me feel like what I've been through was worthwhile.’ For more information, visit http://www.nfsuk.org.uk/ .","Katy Yates, 32, developed pre-eclampsia eight weeks before her due date .

And now Angelina Jolie's surgeon has revealed how the actress refused to let her decision to have a double mastectomy prevent her from doing her work. In a blog post on the Pink Lotus Breast Center website, Dr Kristi Funk detailed how the 37-year-old actress returned to work just four days after having the initial mastectomy procedure. Brave decision: Details of Angelina Jolie's decision to have a double mastectomy have been detailed on the Pink Lotus Breast Center website . Describing the scene, Dr Funk writes that Angelina was recovering at home but still managing to concentrate on her next project. The blog post reads: 'On day four after her mastectomies, I . was pleased to find her not only in good spirits with bountiful energy, . but with two walls in her house covered with freshly assembled . storyboards for the next project she is directing. Taking charge: Dr Kristi Funk was one of the main surgeon's on Angelina's case . 'The next day she had her first injection . of saline into the expanders, thus beginning the process that would . gradually prepare the tissues for the final stage of her operations, . reconstruction. 'A . second saline fill occurred on March 4. Over the next four weeks she was . hard at work.' Dr Funk added: 'To a large extent, I believe recovery reflects expectation. Angelina expected to feel well, to be active.' It is thought that the project Angelina was working on is the story of second world war air force officer Louis Zamperini, who spent 47 days on a raft after a plane crash before being captured by the Japanese. Angelina announced last year that she would be directing the film version of Laura Hillenbrand's book Unbroken, saying in a statement: 'I read Laura Hillenbrand’s brilliant book, and I was so moved by Louie Zamperini’s heroic story, I immediately began to fight for the opportunity to make this film,” Jolie said in a statement.  “Louie is a true hero and a man of immense humanity, faith and courage. I am deeply honored to have the chance to tell his inspiring story.' Other project Angelina has in the pipeline include Kung Fu Panda 3 and Salt 2. The Pink Lotus blog also details how Angelina's fiancé Brad Pitt offered his unwavering support throughout her three months of operations. Dr Funk writes: 'On February 2, 2013, Angelina was in the . operating room for the first operation, the nipple delay. Her partner . was on hand to greet her as soon as she came around from the anesthetic, . as he was during each of the operations.' Detailed description: The blog post lists Angelina's procedures step by step . Celebrity clientele: The Pink Lotus Breast Center in Beverly Hills also treated Sheryl Crow . Meanwhile, Angelina has revealed she is . 'grateful and overwhelmed' by the outpouring of public support . following the publication of the op ed in the New York Times which . detailed her decision. Angelina decided to have the procedures after . discovering she was a carrier of the BRCA1 gene - meaning she had an 87% . chance of contracting breast cancer. And New York Times columnist Nicholas . Kristof has revealed the actress asked him to pass on her gratitude . following the public's response to her op ed in the paper. Kristof tweeted: 'I've spoken to Angelina Jolie several times in the last few days, and she has been so strong, so brave, so determined. 'She wants to use her medical issues to nurture a national conversation on health options. No self pity; she just wants to help. Unwavering support: The blog also reveals Brad was by Angelina's side as she woke from every operation . 'Angelina Jolie also asked me to thank everyone: She is SO grateful and overwhelmed by the outpouring of public support. 'And she's thrilled and grateful to see people taking this and having serious, empowering discussions of women's health.' The . news that Angelina is a BRCA1 carrier was made all the more personal by the fact that Angelina lost her . mother Marcheline Bertrand to ovarian cancer when she was just 56. Revealing her decision to have . the surgery, Angelina said it was the support of . her six children and fiancé Brad which got her through the operation. Speaking . out: Angelina, pictured here on April 4, underwent the surgery after discovering . she had an 87% change of contracting breast cancer . Brave choice: Angelina looked in good spirits as . she attended the Women in the World event following the initial stage . of the procedures . In the editorial piece entitled 'My Medical Choice', Angelina wrote: 'I am . fortunate to have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and supportive. So to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through this, know that . you are a very important part of the transition. Brad was at the Pink . Lotus Breast Center, where I was treated, for every minute of the . surgeries. 'We managed to . find moments to laugh together. We knew this was the right thing to do . for our family and that it would bring us closer. And it has.' Brad later released his own statement praising his 'heroic Angie' following her difficult decision. Family matters: Angelina did her utmost to keep life as normal as possible for her and partner Brad Pitt's six children . In a statement to London's Evening . Standard, Brad said: 'Having witnessed this decision firsthand, I find . Angie’s choice, as well as so many others like her, absolutely heroic. I . thank our medical team for their care and focus. Tragic loss: Angelina's mother Marcheline Bertrand sadly died from ovarian cancer at the age of 56 . 'All I want for is for her to have a long and healthy life, with myself and our children. This is a happy day for our family.' Angelina also revealed she is proud of her children for being so brave during her operations, which began on February 16th with the initial removal, before she had the reconstruction operation on April 20th. She writes: 'It is reassuring that they see . nothing that makes them uncomfortable. They can see my small scars and . that’s it. 'Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and will do anything to be with them as . long as I can.' Following the operations, Angelina's risk of contracting breast cancer has now dropped to under 5%. She wrote: . 'My doctors estimated that I had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% . risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of . each woman. 'Only a . fraction of breast cancers result from an inherited gene mutation. Those . with a defect in BRCA1 have a 65% risk of getting it, on average. Once . I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to . minimize the risk as much I could. I made a decision to have a . preventive double mastectomy. Still working hard: Angelina attended the G8 summit in London on April 11 with William Hague, after the initial operation but prior to the process being finished .

Hackers: Elvis Rafael Rodriguez (left) and Emir Yasser Yeje (right), of New York were arrested for the robbery . U.S. prosecutors untangling the aftermath of a $45million global cyber heist have released images of the suspected criminals' impressive  loot, including piles of cash, high-end watches and even a luxury car. Among the items seized from the seven men arrested in the U.S. Thursday were shopping bags from Gucci, a Porsche Panamera and a dozen fake credit cards. Meanwhile, German prosecutors said on Friday they had made two more arrests in connection to the case. A 35-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman, both Dutch citizens, were caught on February 19 withdrawing 170,000 euros ($220,500) in Düsseldorf using Bank of Muscat credit cards. In total, $2.4million dollars was withdrawn in seven German cities, the prosecutors said. On Thursday, U.S. prosecutors said an international criminal gang had stolen $45million from two Middle Eastern banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from cash machines in 27 countries. They allegedly used hacked debit-card data to make 40,500 transactions worldwide. The ringleaders of the global operation were believed to be outside the United States but U.S. prosecutors have declined to give details, citing the continuing investigation. Germany is the only other country so far to announce arrests. A spokesman for the Düsseldorf prosecutor's office said the two Dutch people under arrest had come to Düsseldorf with the purpose of withdrawing money in Germany. The two suspects are accused of computer fraud and faking credit cards. Germany's banking association, BdB, said it was not aware of any banks in Germany suffering losses as a result of the scheme.

Time of reckoning: The alleged gang members enjoyed the finer things in life, including high-ended watches like the Rolexes seized from Evan Jose Peoa (left) and the Rolex Yacht-Master worth $42,000 (right) In the complaint on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department accused eight men of withdrawing $2.4million from 3,000 bank cash machines in New York in the space of 10 hours in February. The Department said seven of the men have been arrested. Terminated: Alberto Lajud-Pena, 23, allegedly the leader of the New York cell, was killed in the Dominican Republic on April 27 . Authorities said they arrested these seven U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New . York: Jael Mejia Collado, Joan Luis Minier Lara, Evan Jose . Peña, Jose Familia Reyes, Elvis Rafael Rodriguez, Emir Yasser Yeje and . Chung Yu-Holguin. Dominican police on Friday confirmed that the eighth, Alberto Lajud-Pena, allegedly the leader of the New York cell, was killed in the Dominican Republic on April 27. The 23-year-old suspect was gunned down during an attempted robbery in a house in the city of San Francisco de Macoris about 100 miles northeast of the capital, Santo Domingo, according to police. Investigators found $100,000 in cash in the house, as well as an M-16 assault rifle, two 9 mm pistols, a revolver, ammunition clips and a telescopic sight. The money and weapons belonged to Lajud-Pena, police said. Lajud-Pena, known as 'Prime' and 'Albertico,' was shot and killed by a gang of three men, of whom the leader was Carlos Manuel Jiménez, alias ‘La Vaca Loca’ (Mad Cow), according to police in the Dominican Republic. Jiménez and the two men were in custody, police said. It was not immediately clear if the gang or the $100,000 found at the house were linked to the cyber theft. U.S. prosecutors have said that $2million in cash is still missing from the heists. A man arrested in his death told authorities it was a botched robbery, and two other suspects were on the lam. Hot ride: This high-end Porsche Panamera with a price tag of up to $175,000 was seized from Evan Jose Peoa . Plastic: Prosecutors released images of a dozen fake credit cards seized from Peoa . According to court documents, Lajud Pena communicated via email with a Russian criminal organization that specializes in laundering money and wrote to his shadowy bosses in charge of the operation. He wired money and deposited cash into several accounts. ‘I sent scanned deposit slips,’ Lajud Pena writes in one. ‘Deposit has cleared. Order paid. Good job,’ the sender replies. Prosecutors said Lajud Pena recruited men he knew from Yonkers, some of whom worked as bus drivers for a company that provided services to special-needs students. Members of the global criminal . organization hacked into two credit card processors and used stolen data . to make the withdrawals, during two separate coordinated incidents in . December 2012 and February 2013, the Justice Department said. The . government charged eight individuals in New York with participating in . the larger scheme by withdrawing $2.8million in thousands of ATM . transactions, in what U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said was the . second-biggest bank robbery in the history of New York City. Caught at the ATM: Jose Familia Reyes was caught on camera on New York's Third Avenue making four withdrawals of $4,015 . ATM withdrawals: Jose Familia Reyes is caught on camera making large cash withdraws from various ATMs around Manhattan . Across town: Jose Familia Reyes makes more withdrawals on New York's Broadway . Lynch said it was likely that the . headquarters of the global scheme was located outside the United States . and that the current charges focused only on the New York-based cell. Investigators were examining whether other cells were operating elsewhere in the United States, she said. 'In the place of guns and masks, this cyber crime organization used laptops and the Internet. 'Moving . as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way . from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets . of New York City, with the defendants fanning out across Manhattan to . steal millions of dollars from hundreds of ATMs in a matter of hours,' said Lynch, whose office in Brooklyn, New York, brought the case. The big heist: Jose Familia Reyes continues down Broadway in Manhattan, making cash withdrawals of over $2,000 from each ATM . Second biggest bank robbery in NYC history: Jose Familia Reyes was part of the international cyber hacking ring that stole millions . Part of the gang: Jose Familia Reyes was one of seven defendants, all U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New York . The case demonstrates the major threat that cyber crime poses to banks around the world. Security experts frequently identify electronic fraud as one of the key challenges facing banks today. 'Hackers only need to find one . vulnerability to cause millions of dollars of damage,' said Mark Rasch, a . former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, based in Bethesda, Maryland. In . the December attack, hackers gained access to an Indian credit card . processor that handled prepaid Mastercard Inc debit cards for National . Bank of Ras Al Khaimah PSC, or RAKBANK, according to a criminal . indictment. RAKBANK said on Friday the fraud against it took place at the end of last year and resulted in losses of around $4.7 million for the United Arab Emirates-based lender. Bank CEO Graham Honeybill said he believed the fraud went wider than lenders in the Gulf region. ‘We are given to understand that the overall fraud encompassed a number of banks not only in the Middle East but in the USA and other countries,’ Honeybill said in a statement. The amount of the potential loss for RAKBANK was 17.4 million UAE dirhams ($4.7million) and this had been fully provided for before it closed its 2012 accounts, Honeybill said. ‘The bank can confirm that none of its customers suffered any financial loss as a result of this fraud,’ he added. The incident related to events in December 2012 and involved the bank's service provider in India, he said, without naming the provider or giving any further details. In . February, the hackers broke into the system of a U.S.-based credit card . processor to steal account numbers for prepaid Mastercard debit cards . issued by Bank of Muscat, the indictment said. The second operation was far larger than the first attack, eventually totaling $40million in losses to Bank of Muscat. Evidence: Images from the iPhone of Elvis Rafael Rodriguez (left) show the hacker with Emir Yasser Yeje (right), of New York, along with cash and items bought with the stolen money . New York based ring: Charts showing information related to eight members belonging to a New York-based cell of a global cyber criminal organization are displayed at a news conference today . In . late February, Bank Muscat disclosed that it would take an impairment . charge of up to 15 million rials ($39million) because it had been . defrauded overseas using 12 prepaid debit cards used for travel. That charge was equal to more than half of the 25 million rials profit it posted in its first quarter ended March 31. The indictment does not identify the processor companies. Bank representatives could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours. In . both cases, the hackers boosted the available balance for each card and . eliminated the withdrawal limits, allowing them to take out huge sums . of money from ATMs in what prosecutors called an 'unlimited operation.' A . single account number, for instance, yielded nearly $9million in . profits, including $2.4million in New York City alone, prosecutors . said. The hackers . distributed the account numbers to coordinated 'casher' crews stationed . across the globe, who siphoned millions of dollars from ATMs within a . span of hours in December 2012 and February 2013. Map of the hit areas: This map shown at a press conference in New York show the ATMS which the cyber hackers hit . Worldwide ring: In February, the hackers broke into the system of a U.S.-based credit card processor to steal account numbers for prepaid Mastercard debit cards issued by Bank of Muscat (pictured in Oman), the indictment said . One of the New York defendants was caught in surveillance footage from ATMs in Manhattan during the February operation, prosecutors said. After the cards were shut down, cashers laundered the proceeds, often by purchasing luxury goods, and sent a portion of the money back to the organization's leaders, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and bank accounts, as well as two Rolex watches and a Mercedes SUV, from the New York defendants. No individual bank accounts were compromised by the scheme, Lynch said.

Arrested: Claude Alexander Allen III, 20, faces charges for the murder of Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, in the woods near the Allen family home . The son of a former aide to President George W. Bush has been charged with murdering a man with a hatchet at his home. Claude Alexander Allen III, 20, was arrested on Friday by police after they found the body of Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, in the woods near the Allen family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Records show that the home is owned by Allen's father, Claude A. Allen, a former Bush domestic policy adviser who pleaded guilty to theft in 2006. The student called 911 around midnight and told police that he killed an intruder after he tried to break in. But authorities determined it wasn't a break-in and that the younger Allen knew Harvey. Harvey's body was found around 75 yards behind the house but police told the Washington Post that they believe an altercation occurred and the attack started in a two-car garage. Montgomery County Police Capt. Jim Daly told the Post it was not clear if the argument moved to the woods or if the man's . body was dragged there after he died. When . police arrived at the large white-brick home, Allen was waiting for . them but that his parents were not home at the time of the attack. They . found the hatchet in a garbage can. Crime scene: Investigators gather outside the Maryland property where a man was killed with a hatchet . Another man had been there, but left by the time police arrived. They tracked him down and questioned him but he is not a suspect, Daly told the Post. A lawyer who represented the younger Allen in a marijuana case declined comment. A neighbor told the Post that Allen, a star soccer and rugby player, had just returned home from college in the state. It is not the family's first brush with the law; Claude Alexander Allen, now 52, was arrested in 2006 for allegedly claiming refunds for more than $5,000 worth of merchandise he did not buy. Connections: George W. Bush is pictured with deputy chief of staff Karl Rove (center) and domestic policy adviser Claude Allen (right), in July 2005. Allen's son has now been arrested for murder . Legal issues: The alleged murderer's father (seen left of then-President Bush in 2005) left the administration when he was caught shoplifting $5,000-worth of merchandise . The thefts occurred at 25 stores from 2005 until 2006 even though his annual salary as an adviser was $160,000 . 'I was shocked and my first reaction was one of disappointment, deep disappointment - if it's true - that we were not fully informed,' Bush said at the time. Allen pleaded guilty to theft on August 4, 2006. He claimed that in the months leading up to the thefts, he had suffered huge stress and sleep deprivation. His wife cited Hurricane Katrina and his subsequent work as one of the causes of stress. Allen was ordered to reimburse Target for the $850 of stolen merchandise. He also paid a $500 fine and agreed to perform 40 hours of community service. Disgraced: Allen Sr., pictured left with his wife Jannese as he leaves court and right in his mugshot, stepped down from the role working for Bush in 2005 after he was caught shoplifting . A trained lawyer, he was a deputy secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services and nominated to a federal appeals court seat in 2003. He joined the White House during Bush's second term but abruptly resigned from the role shortly after being charged with misdemeanor theft. In September 2011, the D.C. Court of Appeals suspended his license to practice law in D.C. fora year, following suspensions in Virginia and Pennsylvania. His son is one of four children with his wife, Jannese.","Police officers found the body of Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, in the woods near the home of Claude A. Allen III on Friday .

Carlos is under investigation for possible tax fraud and money . laundering in a further blow to the reputation of Spain's royal family. A judge today asked tax authorities for information regarding Princess Cristina's property and investments. Palma de Mallorca court judge Jose Castro also requested information on her finances relating to her partnership with her husband Inaki Urdangarin in a firm called Aizoon. Allegations: The daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos, Princess Cristina, is under investigation for possible tax fraud and money laundering. She is pictured with . her husband, the Duke of Palma Inaki Urdangarin . The court recently withdrew a subpoena against the 47-year-old princess for questioning over the alleged embezzlement of public funds by Urdangarin. However, it said she could still be called to answer questions regarding their finances. Friday's decision comes after a year of health and image problems for the 75-year-old Juan Carlos, once one of Spain's most respected figures. There was no immediate comment from the palace. Blow: News of the investigation is a further blow to the Spanish Royal family after polls last month suggested support for the monarchy has fallen to a record low of 54 per cent. Spanish King Juan Carlos I is pictured . Cristina is the youngest of the King’s . two daughters, behind Princess Elena, 49 . The King and wife Sofia also . have a son, Prince Felipe, 45, who is heir to the throne. Polls last month suggested that support for the monarchy has fallen to a record low of 54 per cent. It also follows the revelation that Juan Carlos, 75, received a 2.2million Euro inheritance, deposited in three Swiss bank accounts, when his father Juan died on April 1, 1993. Questions are now being asked as to whether the King, under fire for going elephant-hunting in Africa last year as recession continues to bite, paid the correct amount of tax on the sum. The trip to Botswana only came to light after he fell and broke his hip, but sparked anger among Spain’s 5 million unemployed. It also cost him his role as honorary president of the Spanish branch of the World Wildlife Fund and saw him issue an unprecedented apology. It is in stark contrast to a decade ago when Juan Carlos was left virtually untouched by the media. He was held in great respect for his role in brokering the transition from dictatorship to democracy following the death of General Franco in 1975. It comes as Spain today returned to Tunisia a $5 million, 32-metre (105-foot) yacht belonging to the family of the country's deposed president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. A Spanish court of appeal in February responded to a request from Tunisian prosecutors and confiscated the yacht once owned by Belhassen Trabelsi, the brother-in-law of deposed Tunisian President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. Trabelsi fled Tunisia in the revolution that deposed the government in January 2011 and has asked for asylum in Montreal.

Following back-to-back sunshine breaks in Puerto Rico and Miami Topshop heiress Chloe Green was back to work on Thursday launching her latest shoe collection in London. The 22-year-old has hit the headlines this year thanks to a high profile romance with J-Lo's ex Marc Anthony, but he was nowhere to be seen as the tycoon's daughter and her mother Tina threw an exclusive event in Notting Hill to unveil her new designs to the fashion press. The first two collections, designed by Chloe and her team and stocked in Selfridges as well as Topshop (of course) as well as on Chloe's website, defied critics to become a commercial success and the businesswoman is hoping the latest shoe and accessory line will follow suit. Chloe Green has unveiled her third high street shoe collection . Chloe said: 'I have learned a lot . since my first collection. Instead of just creating shoes that I would like I'm learning about designing for my market, which includes a lot of tall people that I hadn't expected, clubbers, . people on holiday and girls out for dinner, As well as my mum. 'I get brilliant feedback from . customers who like what I'm doing and now my biggest challenge is to . keep bringing them back each season by reworking their favourites as . well as giving them something new. 'Even . in the Christian Louboutin or Giuseppe Zanotti world of shoes the classic styles . are available season after season, they are just revamped with new . detail.' The first two collections defied critics to become a commercial success and the label is now stocked at Selfridges as well as Topshop and on Chloe's own site . The new collection includes stacked platforms and mega wedges, all featuring Chloe's signature green sole . As a petite girl growing up in the world of fashion very high heels were an early necessity for Philip Green's only daughter. She said: ''What do you do when you are a short 14-year-old and your friends all start growing taller and leaving you behind? You find the highest pair of heels your mother owns and start trying to walk in them. 'I spent a lot of my early teenage years practising walking in my mum's shoes, and now she is one of my biggest fans... she wears my shoes more than I do.' Talking about the collection which this season includes skyscraper wedges, . stacked platforms and studded sandals as well as hi-top trainers all . with a distinctive jade green sole, Chloe said: 'They are fast fashion . shoes but they are also a bit exclusive - it's nice that you won't see . many people in the same style as you on a night out. 'We have bought the styles on, but . you have to always be proud of what you design and be able to stand by . it and I am proud of the shoes in all three of my collections because . they are all very me.' Chloe said: ''My biggest challenge is to keep bringing my customers back each season by reworking their favourites as well as giving them something new.' Chloe's relationship with boyfriend Marc Anthony has raised eyebrows due to the 22 year age gap, but the tycoon's daughter admitted that she doesn't let him being twice her age stop her telling him what to wear. She told Grazia Daily: 'I get the odd question of 'Do you like what I'm wearing?' and I'm like, 'No not really'. Then he says, 'How would you wear it?'. I'll then say, 'Make it a bit cooler - wear it with some trainers and a T-shirt.' He's then, 'Okay, I'm not sure, but if you like it, I like it.' Beau Marc is obviously a fan of her work, but he's not her only celebrity supporter. She said: 'Nicole Scherzinger has been great. She saw my collection and loved it and wanted to wear my shoes. Nicole Richie has been really supportive. 'If people don't like it they are going to say something about it so it's just so amazing to have had such great feedback. Like Demi Lovato told me she likes my shoes and I was like, 'You don't just have to say that.' But she said she loved them because they are so comfortable.'

A lawyer for Gerard Depardieu today claimed that his prosecution for drink driving was illegal – because the actor was ‘not completely sober’ when he was told about it. During bizarre proceedings in a Paris criminal court, defence barrister Eric de Caumont admitted the Hollywood actor had been drinking champagne before he fell off his moped in the city last November. But by the time he was questioned by detectives and then charged he was still too drunk to understand what was going on. Mr De Caumont’s claims were denied by Paris police who said in a statement that Depardieu was ‘conscious, lucid and able to respond’ when he was charged. Bizarre excuse: Gerard Depardieu claims that his prosecution for drink-driving on his moped (file picture) was illegal because the actor was 'not completely sober' when he was told about it . Depardieu meanwhile failed to turn up in court today because he was away filming a thriller with Elizabeth Hurley in a country notorious for its human rights abuses. Despite all this, prosecutors called for Depardieu to be banned from driving for 10 months and to be fined the equivalent of £3,400. The 64-year-old French movie star’s case had been postponed three times because he kept staying away. He was accused of driving his moped through Paris while more than three times over the drink-drive alcohol limit. no show: The actor, seen here in New York earlier this month, didn't appear at court today because he is filming . ‘He’s very busy in Grozny,’ said Mr De . Caumont, referring to the capital of Chechnya, where Depardieu and Miss . Hurley are working. Mr De Caumont said Depardieu 'asked me to represent him in court where he wants to be judged, as he always said.' Star: Depardieu is currently filming a thriller with Liz Hurley (above) in Chechnya . Mr De Caumont also said he wanted to get Depardieu’s case struck out because correct procedures where allegedly ignored when police measured the amount of alcohol in his bloodstream. But judges went ahead with the case and, after hearing evidence, deferred judgement until June 21st. Depardieu, the star of some 150 films including Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac, and Miss Hurley are making a movie called Turquoise in Chechnya, a country with a notorious human rights record which is run by the controversial Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov, a close friend of Depardieu, has been implicated in numerous crimes including torture and extra-judicial killings, but denies any wrong doing. Miss Hurley said she was initially told that the film would be shot in Moscow, and ‘had to take a very deep breath’ when she was informed that filming would also take place in Chechnya. Miss Hurley has claimed she has not met Kadyrov, but the leader has in turn posted pictures on social media showing him accompanying the actress and Depardieu around Grozny.

While he did not formally confirm . that he was the one to pay the pricey sum for the picture, Kimmel's . response comes as a certain declaration- one that he ultimately overturned. Jeffrey Ross posed for a picture with 'the biggest surprise of his life', the nude portrait of Bea Arthur that he said Jimmy Kimmel bought for him as a surprise . Confirmation? Jimmy Kimmel seemingly declared that he had sent the painting to his friend and fellow comedian . Denial: Kimmel claimed the whole thing was a joke . 'Bea is watching over all of us, but especially you,' Kimmel wrote. Later Friday night, Kimmel came back clearing things up by saying that he had nothing to do it with.

While the entire situation seemed like one of Kimmel's made-for-late-night pranks from the beginning, the history between Ross and Arthur added an element of validity to the story. Ross has worked with Comedy Central for years, and one of his duties was hosting the channel's annual roasts of big stars. In 1999, he was the emcee at the roast honoring Jerry Stiller, and Stiller's good friend Bea Arthur was in the audience. At one point during the ceremony, Ross made a lewd joke at Arthur's expense, and she took it in stride, glaring back at him for an extra laugh. 'She gave me this hilarious stare, this stink-eye that made — let’s face it — an OK joke into a great moment, a great Roast moment,' Ross said in an interview for the TV Howl blog. 'And then over time, I felt like she put me on the map because everywhere I went people were quoting this joke to me.  I’m hearing it all the time, it’s quoted in newspapers at the end of the year, it was part of all these roundups of the greatest lines of the year, and I’m realizing that I’m sort of getting a boost from this ridiculous joke that’s not even that funny.' He said that as his name became more and more associated with Arthur's, he felt indebted to her and attended one of her one-woman shows. At the end of the performance, he waited in line to say hello to her and she immediately recognized him. 'She just stuck a finger right in my face and said, ""You nailed me, you prick!"" And we both laughed and she gave me a hug. It was really cool knowing what a fun broad she was,' he said.

A former Texas prosecutor and one-time candidate for Congress has been convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for court favors, including an $80,000 payment in a scheme that allowed a convicted murder to escape. Jurors convicted former Cameron County District Attorney Armanda Villalobos on racketeering, bribery and extortion charges. The former prosecutor was accused of taking more than $100,000 in bribes from attorneys. Former Texas District Attorney Armando Villalobos exits the federal courthouse looking downcast after a federal jury convicted him of accepting bribes in exchange for court favors, including $80k to aid in a convicted murderer's escape . Villalobos denied any wrongdoing and testified during his trial that he did not request money from lawyers in exchange for appointments with him. Among the allegations were that Villalobos participated in a scheme involving Amit Livingston, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend, Hermila Hernandez, in 2007. Amit Livingston, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend Hermila Hernandez in 2007, escaped prison when in exchange for an $80k bribe . Prosecutors alleged former state District Judge Abel Lima agreed to work with Villalobos and Villalobos' former law partner, Eddie Lucio, in criminal and civil cases involving Livingston. The trio's target was the $500,000 bond put up for Livingston's release before trial.Federal prosecutors alleged Villalobos set up Lucio to represent Hernandez's three children in their lawsuit against Livingston, and the criminal and civil cases both landed in Limas' courtroom. In the criminal case, Limas agreed to convict and sentence Livingston on the same day, thereby freeing up his bond to be used as the settlement in the civil suit. However, Limas also agreed that day to . Livingston's request that he would have 60 days to get his affairs in . order before reporting to prison. That . meant Livingston was released without bond, highly unusual for a . convicted killer already sentenced to decades in prison. Livingston . didn't report to prison as scheduled and hasn't been seen since.Lucio . received $200,000 in attorney's fees for handling the civil case. Prosecutors said he kicked $80,000 back to Villalobos and together they . gave about $10,000 to Limas to keep quiet. Lucio . also faces charges in the case. Lima, who was one of the main witnesses . at Villalobos' trial, pleaded guilty to racketeering and awaits . sentencing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Wynne told jurors in his opening statement that the cash payments Villalobos accepted from attorneys in exchange for his prosecutorial discretion amounted to 'having a district attorney on retainer.' Texas District Attorney Armanda Villalobos (seen here giving a press conference during his term as DA) was convicted of accepting bribes from attorneys in exchange for favors in court.

Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel was pictured partying in a Dallas club on Saturday, the night after he and his teammates won big in the Cotton Bowl tournament. Part of the spectacle surrounding his Heismen trophy win came from the fact that he was the first freshman football player ever to win the coveted prize, but now his age is the reason for his currently problem.

Dallas-based DJ Avi posted a picture of himself with Manziel at Avenu last night, captioning it: 'it's a party'. In the picture, Manziel is holding an open bottle of what appears to be Dom Perignon champagne. The same is true in other photos obtained by TMZ, which show the 20-year-old pumping his fists in the air while holding the pricey champagne. The lighting shows that between a third and a half of the bottle had already been consumed. Scene: Manziel was partying in Avenu Lounge in Dallas which is a 21-and-over club . He clearly was in a celebratory mood, as he danced around with friends and held a lit sparkler in his mouth. Even if he argues that he was not drinking the champagne, that is not the only problem wrong with the picture. Avenu is a 21-and-over club, so both he and the establishment could face legal drama. This isn't the first time that Manziel's age caused him problems, as he was arrested in College Station, Texas previously for using a fake ID and allegedly participating in a fight, leading to two misdemeanor charges.

"By . Becky Barrow . UPDATED: . 04:07 EST, 21 July 2011 . Bankers and other finance workers scooped bonuses totalling an eye-watering £14billion this year, official figures revealed today. Critics accused bankers of ‘greed’ for making such vast sums of money despite their role in triggering the current financial crisis. The size of the massive windfall will outrage millions of ordinary hard-working Britons who face a daily battle to stay financially afloat. Bubble: Workers in the financial sector, based around the City, pictured, have scooped a total of £14bn in bonuses - despite ordinary Britons suffering an age of austerity . The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show how the country’s finance sector is cut off from the pain facing everybody else. Between April 2010 and March 2011, a total of £14billion in bonuses was paid out to workers in the 'finance and insurance' sector. They account for just 4 per cent of the workers in this country – but they get about 40 per cent of the total of £35billion of bonuses which are paid out. This year’s bumper crop of bonuses completely overshadows the bonuses paid out a decade ago, the ONS figures show. In 2000/1, the total bonuses paid out to bankers and other finance workers added up to around £8billion. Ten years later, they have jumped by £6billion a year, despite the industry bringing the world's economies to the brink of collapse. Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: 'These banking bonus figures show sheer greed. 'Our country won’t believe ""We are all in this together"" until the Government gets a grip on bank bonuses.' The figures show the average finance and insurance worker got a bonus of £12,500. The average British worker, who earns about £25,000 and does not get a bonus, has to work for about six months to earn this amount of money. Their finances are under attack from tax rises, such as VAT, pay freezes or paltry pay rises, soaring gas bills, rip-off petrol prices – and no bonus from their boss. In (rare) agreement: Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, left, and Brendan Barber, head of the TUC, right, both criticised the huge bonus payouts . Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: 'The Chancellor’s austerity message has failed to reach the City, where a small clique of super-rich bankers has grabbed 40 per cent of all bonuses paid out in the UK. 'City bonuses are still far too high and the incentives for risky and damaging decisions far too great, especially when bankers know that taxpayers will have to pick up the tab.' Some of the big bonus winners even work for banks which are part-owned by the taxpayer. There are 323 'key staff' at Royal Bank of Scotland who shared a pay and bonus pot of £375million last year, equal to an average payout of £1.16million each. By comparison, the rest of the country is being crippled by the first fall in disposable household income since 1981, according to the ONS. The Bank of England governor, Sir . Mervyn King, has warned that bankers' huge bonuses risk alienating . ordinary Britons whose tax money is being used to shore up the financial . system. He said . recently: 'They are paying the price themselves and they are . people...who don't get bonuses on the scale that people in the financial . services sector get. 'They are on much lower incomes [than bankers] and they are paying the price and I think this is a big political problem.' Windfall: A man walks through the entrance hall of the Royal Bank of Scotland's offices in central London. 323 staff there shared a £375million bonus pot last year . The figures come after MPs on the Treasury Select Committee spoke of the fury of their constituents at the bonus handouts. Andrea Leadsom, a Tory MP who used to work for Barclays, said her constituents, and those of other MPs, regularly write letters expressing their 'rage and absolute frustration'.

When he was admitted to hospital following a fall at his home, old soldier Ken Perkin expected to be treated with dignity. Instead, the 86-year-old was left bristling with anger by staff. For not only did a nurse forcibly shave off his moustache – a fixture for nearly 70 years – they then told him he was ‘lucky’ to be receiving care at all. Complaint: Nurses at Kingston Hospital forcibly shaved off Ken Perkin's moustache . The former Grenadier Guardsman claims the nurse pointed at his moustache and said, ‘We’ll have that off while we’re doing it’. He replied: ‘No you’re not, I’ve had . that since the war and I want to keep it.’ But the nurse went ahead, . saying: ‘We’ll make you look about 17 again.’ His son Ian was furious to see that . the widower’s moustache had been shaved off, leaving his face red raw, . when he visited him in Kingston Hospital, South-west London, on April 3. He raised his concerns with the ward matron, but claims his father was then threatened. ‘My father told me a nurse said, “You are lucky we are still caring for you after your son complained about us”,’ he said. Sergeant Major: Ken (centre) had his moustache since his days in the army in World War II . ‘He was shocked and distressed. I’ve never seen him without a moustache until that point. ‘You hear the Health Secretary . saying it is important elderly patients are treated with dignity and . respect. Well that definitely is not the case at Kingston. If I did that . to somebody, I’d probably get six months in jail.’ The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has highlighted the poor treatment of pensioners in the health service. Mr Perkin, who has now begun to . regrow the moustache that he has worn with pride since he was called up . aged 18 in 1944, was admitted to hospital in February. Furious: Ken's son Ian (right) has complained about the hospital's treatment of the elderly and calls for more dignity for those like his father . He had injured himself in a fall in the annexe where he lives at his son’s house in Worcester Park, south-west London. He was taken first to St George’s . Hospital in Tooting, south-west London, before being transferred to . Kingston two weeks later. He was meant to be moved to nearby Tolworth . Hospital but spent five weeks in Kingston because of hospital infections . he acquired there. Mr Perkin, who after the war was a . sergeant major in the Army Reserves and whose late wife Iris worked at . the secret code-breaking base at Bletchley Park, was finally discharged . on Monday. Care: Kingston hospital have said that they will look into the case and provide Mr Perkin with a full response . Social services told his son the nurse was South American and hadn’t understood she was not meant to shave him completely. A spokesman for Kingston Hospital . said investigations established that the incident had been ‘an innocent . and unfortunate mistake’ by a nurse. ‘The nurse wanted to tidy and clean . him up and did not shave his moustache off intentionally,’  she added. ‘We are all truly sorry  for any distress this has caused  Mr Perkin.’ The hospital said there was ‘no evidence’ Mr Perkin was denied any care as a result of the complaint.","Nurses forcibly shaved off 86-year-old Ken Perkin's moustache .

Two young boys killed after a rockslide poured over them during a school field trip to a Minnesota park have been pictured following the tragic recovery of the final boy's body on Thursday. Ten-year-old Zack Mohamed Fofana, a fourth grader visiting Lilydale Regional Park in St Paul on Wednesday, was recovered one day after being buried in the horrific landslide to the heartbreak of family who never lost hope he was still alive. Haysem Sani, a 9-year-old classmate of Fofan's at Peter Hobart Elementary School, also died on Wednesday after he and two others were initially rushed to a hospital for their injuries, KSTP reports. Tragedy: The body of 10-year-old Zack Mohamed Fofana, left, was pulled from beneath the horrific rockslide's aftermath on Thursday morning after it first took the life of his fellow classmate, Haysem Sani, 9, right . Tragic: Rescue workers near where the landslide that killed at least one elementary student occurred Wednesday in St. Paul, Minnesota . The rain-saturated gravel swept over . the group of children in the St. Louis . Park burying one to the waist and another entirely, Fire Marshal Steve . Zaccard said. St. Paul Assistant Fire Chief Jim . Smith told reporters that crews found the body of the 10-year-old late in the morning after . they came up with a plan for resuming the search safely. Police and firefighters dug frantically with shovels and their hands to get to the children. One child with minor injuries was . treated and released, and the other child remained in serious condition . Thursday, Fire Marshal Steve Zaccard said. The search resumed around 11am on Thursday as the boy's father and uncle stood nearby hoping for a miracle. The boy's uncle, Mohamed Bah, told the Star Tribune while standing near the site that's known for its fossils that his nephew 'liked geology.' His father said his little boy was so excited about the field trip that day. 'He came to me and said, ""You know we have a field trip tomorrow? I'm so happy,""' his father Lancine Fofana told the Pioneer Press on Thursday. Bah told reporters at the scene that he hadn't lost hope in seeing his nephew alive again. Deadly field trip: A rescuer attends to a victim in a stretcher following a Minnesota landslide that killed two elementary school students after rains loosened cliffside gravel in a park known for its fossils . Seconds to spare: A St. Paul firefighter accompanies a victim being lifted out of St. Paul, Minnesota's Lilydale Regional Park after a landslide Wednesday that turned a fourth-grade fossil hunt deadly . Still, he said, 'We believe that . everything happens the way God wants it to happen ... Whatever the . outcome may be, we accept it.' Lilydale Regional Park is a popular destination for school field trips because of the numerous fossils embedded in that part of the Mississippi River bluffs. Partly for safety reasons, the city requires permits for fossil-hunting at the park, and requires applicants to sign a waiver releasing the city from any liability for injuries or property damage. The park department's permit web site and the application form both specifically state that 'some of the conditions and locations within the Lilydale Regional Park area are hazardous to persons or property' and that park users must assume liability for any injuries or claims that might arise 'due to its unsafe conditions.' On Wednesday night search crews . proceeded cautiously through the gravel and light rain in a hunt that . was described as a recovery effort. Tense moment: Rescuers stand following the landslide tragedy that killed one child and initially left one more missing before his body was recovered the next morning . Unthinkable: One child, a 9-year-old boy, was killed by gravel loosened from rain while he searched for fossils with classmates in St. Paul, Minnesota . Crews worked to make the scene safer, using fire hoses to wash away loose dirt before it could fall on searchers. Digging had stopped earlier, and crews were setting up lights and preparing to search into the night,  Zaccard said. ‘Obviously we have a very tragic . situation here today,’ Mayor Chris Coleman said at a news conference . hours after the gravel slide. Police . and firefighters dug frantically with shovels and their hands to get to . the children, Zaccard said. He estimated it took an hour to rescue a . child buried to the waist, and another half-hour to reach the buried . child as more workers and equipment were moved in. As . news of the gravel slide broke, parents gathered at the school, located . in a western Minneapolis suburb several miles away, to await their . children. Zaccard said several days of rain had . softened the ground at the park, but it and nearby Cherokee Park were . open and available to the public Wednesday. Brad Meyer, the city's parks . and recreation spokesman, said it's rare to close a park ‘unless there . is a major hazardous condition.’ Fears: Parents and their children leave the Peter Hobart Elementary School in St. Louis Park after the tragedy . ‘We didn't have any indication that we should close the park or that it was unsafe,’ Meyer said. The . area is popular for school field trips because students can hunt for . fossils in the soft sandstone cliffs, said Michael Rutzick, who was at . the park Wednesday and lives in nearby Mendota Heights. ‘It's all sandstone. Sandstone and trees,’ Rutzick said. Tammy Olson, who lives two blocks away, was at the scene with her two young nephews Wednesday. She said she never considered the park dangerous. ‘I've been here six years, and my husband has been here 23. He said there's never been an issue with accidents down there,’ Olson said. A firefighter also was injured by a falling rock but was expected to recover, Zaccard said. Another firefighter suffered a back injury, and both firefighters were back home, the fire department tweeted.","Family identified body found as 10-year-old Zack Mohamed Fofana .

Ambassador Susan Rice has apologized for not calling the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, terrorist. The comments came after she failed to win over her harshest GOP critics in the Senate during a meeting with them on Tuesday. She claimed she never meant to mislead the American people, and instead used talking points given to her by the intelligence community at the time. Rice has been named as the likely successor to Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, however, several Republican senators are threatening to block her confirmation if President Obama nominates her for any post. Scroll down for video . Not convinced: Rice met for about an hour behind closed doors at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday with Senators John McCain, center, Lindsey Graham, right, and Kelly Ayotte, left . Under fire: Susan Rice has been openly criticized by Republicans her for initial comments after the Benghazi attack . In a statement issued shortly after . the one-hour meeting at the U.S. Capitol of Senators John McCain, . Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte, Rice said she had relied on information . from the CIA before she appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows on . September 16. 'We explained that the talking points . provided by the intelligence community, and the initial assessment upon . which they were based, were incorrect in a key respect: there was no . protest or demonstration in Benghazi,' Ms. Rice said. She added: 'We stressed that neither . I, nor anyone else in the administration, intended to mislead the . American people at any stage in this process, and the administration . updated Congress and the American people as our assessments evolved.' The Republicans said that they remain . unconvinced by her responses and said her visit left them with greater . concerns than before the meeting. They have openly criticized her for . initial comments after the September 11 attack on the U.S. mission in . Benghazi that suggested it was a spontaneous event arising from protests . of an anti-Islam film rather than a premeditated attack. Conflict: The outcry by Republicans may cost Rice the nomination as secretary of state . U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris . Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the attack on the . Benghazi mission and a nearby CIA annex. Intelligence officials later said the attack was possibly tied to al-Qaeda affiliates. McCain . said: 'We are significantly troubled by many of the answers that we . got, and some that we didn't get, concerning evidence that was . overwhelming leading up to the attack on our consulate... It is clear that the information that . she gave the American people was incorrect when she said that it was a . spontaneous demonstration triggered by a hateful video.' He added: 'It was not, and there was . compelling evidence at the time that that was certainly not the case, . including statements by Libyans as well as other Americans who are fully . aware that people don't bring mortars and rocket-propelled grenades to . spontaneous demonstrations.' Graham said: 'I'm more disturbed now than I was . before. I think it does not do justice to the . reality at the time and in hindsight clearly was completely wrong.... In . real time, it was a statement disconnected from reality.' Ayotte said she had 'many . more questions that need to be answered' and suggested she'd vote . against Rice's nomination as secretary of state. Graham added: 'I wouldn't vote for anybody being . nominated out of the Benghazi debacle until I had answers about what . happened that I don't have today,' Graham said. Asked . whether he would block such a nomination, Graham said: 'Oh, absolutely. I would place a hold on anybody that wanted to be promoted for any job . that had a role in the Benghazi situation.' Republicans have argued that the Obama administration tried to play down the terrorist angle in its initial comments to avoid undermining the president's claims of success in fighting al-Qaeda in the run-up to the November 6 election. Rice was accompanied by acting CIA Director Michael Morell and was not seen by reporters. Obama has defended Rice and said if senators have a problem with the administration's handling of Benghazi they should 'go after me' rather than try to 'besmirch her reputation.' Raid: A militant during the assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya on September 11th . Graham also criticized U.S. intelligence agencies that wrote the talking points on which Rice based her public comments. 'I'm very disappointed in our intelligence community. I think they failed in many ways. But with a little bit of inquiry and curiosity, I think it would be pretty clear that to explain this episode as related to a video that created a mob that turned into a riot was far afield,' he said. 'And at the end of the day, we're going to get to the bottom of this.' Rice's controversial Benghazi statements were based on a set of unclassified talking points prepared by U.S. intelligence agencies for members of Congress. The initial draft written by the CIA referred to 'attacks' carried out by 'extremists with ties to al Qaeda.' However by the time Rice received them, 'attacks' had changed to 'demonstrations' and 'with ties to al-Qaeda' had been deleted, multiple U.S. sources have said. Not budging: Senate Armed Services Committee member, Sen Kelly Ayotte, says she had 'many more questions that need to be answered' and suggested she'd vote against Rice's nomination as secretary of state . Those in intelligence circles suggest . the talking points were deliberately vague in order to protect covert . operations in Libya in the aftermath of the attack, adding that an . investigation was still underway when Rice made the rounds of talk shows . on Sept. 16. Republicans, . meantime, suspect Rice was covering up for President Obama, . charging the administration didn't want an al-Qaida terrorist attack to . taint his re-election chances. White House response: Obama administration spokesman Jay Carney says the questions about Rice's talking points have been answered . The White House has denied making those edits and members of Congress are trying to determine where the changes were made. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the questions about Rice's appearance on the talk shows and the talking points had been answered. Carney said: 'The focus on - some might say obsession . (with) - comments made on Sunday shows seems to me, and to many, to be . misplaced. What is the point of the focus on this?' Rice, a Rhodes scholar who's married . to Canadian television producer Ian Cameron, has risen through . Democratic ranks over the years to counsel presidential candidates that . include Michael Dukakis and John Kerry, himself a possible Hillary . Clinton replacement. She has an impressive pedigree - her . father was the first black governor of the Federal Reserve Board, her . mother a renowned education scholar - but Rice's legendary abrasiveness . has prompted misgivings about her suitability for the job from both the . left and right. 'She is ill-equipped to be the . nation's top diplomat for reasons that have little to do with Libya,' Dana Milbank, a left-leaning Washington Post columnist, wrote recently . in a piece that recounted how she once gave respected diplomat Richard . Holbrooke the middle finger when she worked in the Bill Clinton White . House. He called her an 'undiplomatic diplomat.'

But it seems Julian Assange's controversial WikiLeaks website would rather one filmmaker didn't get to have his say. The cyber-publishers appear so desperate to discredit an upcoming documentary about themselves they have taken the unusual step of publishing the entire script online complete with notes pointing out supposed factual errors and sleights of hand. Pre-emptive strike: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appears furious at . the content of an upcoming documentary about his organisation . In 'We Steal Secrets: The Story of . WikiLeaks,' Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney set out to uncover the . story behind Assange, 41, and the website he founded in 2006 to leak . classified information submitted by anonymous sources. The documentary, released today, explores how WikiLeaks, at its height, facilitated the publication of thousands of classified U.S. government documents, including diplomatic cables and U.S. Army logs from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the group say the film inaccurately portrays the . relationship between WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange and Bradley . Manning, the U.S. soldier who provided hundreds of thousands of . classified American documents to the site. They accuse Gibney of using a 'crude gay caricature' to portray Bradley Manning and say the film depicts his decision to leak documents as 'a failure of character, rather than a triumph of conscience.' Oscar winning director Alex Gibney appears to have upset the WikiLeaks founder . To tell the story of WikiLeaks, Gibney sought to interview Assange but found the elusive Australian difficult to persuade, eventually deciding to film without him. But the filmmaker spoke to Assange several times off camera, and said he came to form a picture of a complex character. 'If you catch him in unguarded moments, he can be terribly charming, self-deprecating and a really engaging human being,' Gibney told Reuters. However, whenever Assange felt the conversation was becoming an official interview, Gibney said he became unwilling to 'give me the kind of honest reflections that would have been so important (to the film),' likening him to a 'human soap box.' When Gibney decided to film the documentary without Assange's participation, he said the WikiLeaks founder did not take the news well. 'He likens himself as the puppet master, the one who's pulling the strings on the media. I think he took some offense at the idea that I was independent,' Gibney said, adding that Assange had, at one point, asked to be paid for participating. 'He mentioned that the market rate for an interview with him was a million dollars. I didn't inquire what market that was,' Gibney said with a laugh. Gibney said Assange had asked him to report what other interview subjects in the documentary were saying about him, something he found to be 'highly ironic.' '(WikiLeaks) was supposed to be a transparency organization, and he was asking me to engage with him as if we're now some kind of espionage outfit,' he said. Gibney, 59, has become a prolific documentarian over the past decade, garnering critical praise for his timely films such as 2005's 'Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room' and 2007's Oscar-winning 'Taxi to the Dark Side.' The filmmaker was drawn to WikiLeaks initially with the idea of it being a 'David and Goliath story, with Julian Assange being David,' but over the course of filming for two years, Gibney found the story of WikiLeaks to be as complex as its founder. The timing of the film's release . couldn't be more poignant, with U.S. Army private, Bradley Manning, 25, . who is accused of leaking classified data to the WikiLeaks website, due . to stand trial on June 3. He could face life imprisonment. Unable . to interview Manning for the documentary, Gibney turned to sources that . included friends and former colleagues of Manning, and hacker Adrian . Lamo, who gave the FBI online chatroom logs where Manning had confided . that he had passed classified government information to WikiLeaks. Gibney said he believed that while Assange had become a celebrity with WikiLeaks, Manning had become a 'scapegoat.' Wikileaks complained about the way that Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier who provided hundreds of thousands of classified American documents to the site, was portrayed . 'There's no doubt that (Manning) has been improperly scapegoated...he's pled guilty to leaking. But these larger charges, these more serious charges that the government is trying to hang him with, aiding the enemy, carries a possible death sentence. To me, that's outrageous,' Gibney said. Gibney also turned to Australian filmmaker Mark Davis for footage of Assange before he became a headline; Davis had been following the WikiLeaks founder before the Afghanistan war-log leaks, which propelled Assange and his website into the news. Davis' footage captured a more candid Assange, and Gibney also found home movies from Iceland that showed the WikiLeaks found far less guarded, including a clip of him dancing. During filming, Assange's own story developed alongside that of WikiLeaks, culminating in him hiding out at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he has been accused by two women of rape and sexual assault. Gibney was able to get one of the accusers, former WikiLeaks volunteer Anna, to participate in the documentary. '(Assange) is the expert at holding others to account....but he's never wanted anybody to hold him to account. He can't stand anybody telling him he's wrong, and so he is refusing to be held to account for these sex allegations in Sweden,' Gibney said. 'I think his downfall was hubris,' said Gibney. 'He became reckless. He began to imagine that the transparency agenda and Julian Assange were one and the same. And that's a very dangerous place to go.' Although Assange has not seen the film, the WikiLeaks founder and his supporters, including journalist John Pilger and filmmaker Oliver Stone, 'denounced' the documentary after it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, Gibney said. 'The response around criticism of Julian has been a peculiar kind of tribalism,' said Gibney. 'As if somehow Julian should be above criticism or beyond the law.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . PUBLISHED: . 04:46 EST, 24 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:48 EST, 24 May 2013 . Speaker's wife Sally Bercow is facing a six- figure payout for libelling a Tory peer on Twitter. She has lost a High Court battle with Lord McAlpine over a tweet suggesting he was a child sex offender. Mrs Bercow now faces a  crippling payout and legal costs totalling more than £100,000 after the court decided the  message was libellous. The tweet – sent to her 56,000 online followers on November 4 last year – said: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’ Libellous: Sally Bercow's tweet about Lord McAlpine during the child abuse storm was libellous, the High Court ruled today . She wrote it just two days  after the . BBC’s Newsnight  programme wrongly implicated the former Conservative . Party treasurer in allegations of abuse at a Welsh children’s home in . the 1970s and 1980s. Although the programme did not name Lord McAlpine, it led to widespread internet rumours that he was connected to the abuse. The peer has already agreed a £185,000 settlement with the BBC as well . as £125,000 with ITV after Phillip Schofield revealed his name through . an on-screen blunder. In February, he announced he was dropping defamation claims against . Twitter users with fewer than 500 followers, saying he wished to ‘draw . this unfortunate episode forced into my life to a close’. Mrs Bercow, 43, has always insisted her tweet was not defamatory. During the hearing last month her lawyer, William McCormick QC, said: . ‘It’s the sort of random thought, if one was sitting in one’s room with . one’s family, you might just come out with but instead of speaking it, . tweet it.’ But Lord McAlpine’s lawyers said the tweet ‘pointed the  finger of blame’ at him, suggesting he was a sex offender. Suffering: Lawyers for Tory peer Lord McAlpine said he had suffered 'unnecessary pain' as a result of the court case while Mrs Bercow said the litigation had been a 'nightmare' Couple: Commons Speaker John Bercow is understood to have disapproved of his wife taking part in reality TV shows . Yesterday, Mr Justice Tugendhat agreed with the peer and said the . message provided her online followers with ‘the last piece of the . jigsaw’ in identifying Lord McAlpine as the subject of the Newsnight . documentary. He said: ‘In my judgment, the reasonable reader would understand the . words “innocent face” as being insincere and ironical. There is no . sensible reason for including those words in the tweet if they are to be . taken as meaning that the defendant simply wants to know the answer to a . factual question.’ He added: ‘It is an allegation of guilt. I see no room on these facts for any less serious meaning.’ Last month, Mrs Bercow was directed to pay Lord McAlpine’s estimated £17,000 legal costs incurred during a preliminary hearing. She previously declined three offers to settle the case, but has now agreed to settle the dispute for an undisclosed sum. Her total legal bill, which will include his costs, will reach an estimated £100,000, insiders said yesterday. Publicity: Mrs Bercow has regularly courted controversy including posing in the window of Speaker's House . Fame: In 2011, Mrs Bercow defied opposition from her husband to take part in Celebrity Big Brother alongside celebrity photographer Darryn Lyons . In a statement after the ruling, Mrs Bercow said: ‘Today the High Court . found that my tweet constituted a serious libel, both in its natural . meaning and as an innuendo. ‘To say I’m surprised and disappointed by this is an understatement. However, I will accept the ruling as the end of the matter. ‘I remain sorry for the distress I have caused Lord McAlpine and I . repeat my apologies. I  have accepted an earlier offer his lawyers made . to settle this matter.’ Lord McAlpine’s solicitor, Andrew Reid, said the peer was ‘pleased’ with the result. He added: ‘The apologies previously . received from Mrs Bercow did not concede that her tweet was defamatory. Clearly she must now accept this fact. ‘The failure of Mrs Bercow to admit that her tweet was defamatory caused . considerable unnecessary pain and suffering to Lord McAlpine and his . family over the past six months. ‘With knowledge of the judgment, I am pleased to be able to say that Mrs . Bercow has finally seen sense and has accepted an offer of settlement, . which Lord McAlpine made back in January.’","Sally Bercow wrote: 'Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*'

Jurors at the Old Bailey also found them not guilty of voyeurism at a retrial. Cleared: Anton Rodgers, left, is seen arriving at court today with his father, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, right . They men were given bail throughout the . trial and their families, including Rodgers’ father - Liverpool manager . Brendan Rodgers - watched the proceedings. The prosecution said the players were celebrating a victory in a local cup in July 2011 when they came across the woman, who was drunk, at a club. She woke up at the Jury’s Inn hotel to find her strapless dress pulled down and said she saw explicit pictures on Rodgers’ mobile phone. Richard Barton, prosecuting, said these were taken as a 'permanent record of their conquest'. But despite forensic tests on all the players’ phones, only one photograph was found on Barker’s phone. It showed the sleeping woman with . shaving foam spelling out GB on her thigh. Barker was next to her doing a . thumbs-up sign and smiling. Another player, Leon Redwood, said he went into the room at night and sprayed the foam. Barker and Rodgers said the woman had joined in the 'boy’s banter'. She climbed into bed with them and started kissing them. Dunk and Cook said they were sleeping on the floor and did not get involved with the woman. The woman was said to have 'told a pack of lies' following the incident. Not guilty: Brighton and Hove player Lewis Dunk and his former team-mate Steve Cook, seen left and right at an earlier court appearance, were found not guilty of sexual assault by a jury at the Old Bailey today . She agreed she lied to police and her employers but said she had been humiliated by the sportsmen. She complained to police about the players six months later after getting into a volatile relationship with another player. He wound her up about her photographs being shown around the club and kidded her that a video would be put on YouTube. Police have been unable to find anyone at the club who had seen pictures of the woman. The woman admitted an assortment of lies, including: . The woman hoped she would be taken out by Redwood on July 16, but started kissing and dancing with another player, Roland Bergkamp, after seeing him with another girl. She said she was not drunk and could remember nothing after taking a drink in the club. But her friend said they had each drunk between 10 and 15 shots of alcohol and shared a bottle of wine. Jurors at an earlier trial in February could not agree verdicts but found Dunk not guilty of voyeurism. Ordeal: George Barker (seen at a court appearance earlier this month), 21, and the other three footballers had maintained their innocence . Brighton this week released Rodgers and his team-mate Ben Sampayo, who was a reluctant prosecution witness in the case. There were tears in the public gallery from the mothers and girlfriends of the footballers as the seven men and five women returned their verdicts. The young sportsmen were released from the dock and wept in a group hug outside. Visibly shaken, they were comforted by their families. Dunk said outside court today: 'This is the best feeling in the world.' His father Mark said: 'I believed 100 per cent that he was innocent and now it has been proved in court. 'I hope he will be able to build up his career again. This sort of thing would have an effect on anybody’s career.' Solicitor Steven Barker said: 'Lewis is grateful to the jury for their consideration of his case and their verdicts. 'Lewis would like to thank his family and girlfriend, everyone at Brighton and Hove Albion football club, his many friends and supporters and his legal team for their support. 'Lewis is looking forward to putting the ordeal of being wrongly accused of these matters behind him and regaining his place in the Brighton first team.' Rodgers left court with his father by his side and refused to comment on the verdict. His solicitor, Mark Haslam, speaking on behalf of the family, said: 'We are delighted that the jury has reached the correct verdict in this case. 'The past 18 months have been very stressful for Anton and his family so it is a great relief this long ordeal is finally over.' In a statement, George Barker said: 'Since the day of my arrest in January 2011 I have always vigorously protested my innocence of the allegations that were made against me. 'Today the jury have confirmed my innocence and I have always had complete faith the jury would come to the correct decision. 'Having to live with these allegations over the last two years has been enormously difficult for me, for my family and for my friends. However, I have been able to rely on the knowledge of my own innocence. 'I am enormously grateful to my amazing family - and in particular my mother, Julie - for their love and support throughout the past two years. 'Being able to rely upon them at all times has been hugely reassuring to me during what has seemed at times like a nightmare. 'They are simply wonderful.' He added: 'I am now looking forward to spending some time with my family and getting on with my life and with my football.' Cook left court with his family without commenting. The defendants were awarded their costs.","Anton Rodgers, Lewis Dunk, George Barker and Steve Cook all cleared .

A mother-of-four who killed a woman in a car crash while driving in a 'fast and furious' manner following a row with her boyfriend was jailed for six years today. A witness said Sheri Torkington, 32, was driving 'as if on a suicide mission' before she jumped a red light and smashed into Laura Farrell's car in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Mrs Farrell, 41, who was driving her husband Norman to work at the time, died at the scene. Her husband, 54, suffered a broken neck, nine broken ribs, a broken collar-bone, three fractures to his pelvis and a punctured lung. Passing sentence at Bolton Crown Court today, Judge Timothy Stead said Torkington deliberately drove through the red light. Before the crash at about 3.30am in June 2011, Torkington had a blazing row with Phillip Holt, who she has since married. One witness said she was woken at 3am and heard the couple 'shouting, screaming and yelling' at each other in a row over her ex-lover. She had denied causing death by dangerous driving but was convicted at earlier following only 30 minutes of deliberation by the jury. Judge Stead, who also banned Torkington from driving for six years, told her: 'You were in a . considerable temper and you were taking your temper out in the way you . drove. 'One witness said it was almost like handbrake turns, involving . screeching and revving. She was so concerned, she said to her husband, . you were either drunk, drugged-up or on a suicide mission. 'I am sure that what you decided to do, in the temper that you were in, . was to drive across that junction, through a red light deliberately . knowing that the light was set against you. 'This was a grossly dangerous . thing to do. Torkington, right, had denied jumping the red light but was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. Laura Farrell's husband Norman, left, suffered a broken neck in the crash but said the pain of his injuries did not compare to the pain of losing his wife . 'Mr Farrell said his own physical pain was nothing next to what he is . feeling because of the loss of his wife. That is something that has to . be borne as part of your responsibility.' During the trial the court heard that . after the row Torkington jumped into her Ford Fiesta and was seen to . angrily revv up her car engine before wheel spinning. She careered through residential streets . in Bolton before ploughing into Mrs Farrell's Ford . Focus at up to 45mph as the victim's car was going through a green . light. A cyclist saw Mrs Farrell, a HSBC bank clerk, driving through the green light when Torkington's car sped through . the red light in the middle lane. Her car pushed Mrs Farrell's vehicle . into the crash barrier and then spun into the middle of the dual . carriage way. Mr Farrell who had been in a relationship with Laura for 23 years, but . were only married for seven added: 'Laura took the car out of gear, . coasting up to the lights which were on red - we must have been . travelling at 10mph. Torkington drove like she was on a 'suicide mission' before ploughing into Mrs Farrell's car at Turton Street, Bolton (pictured) 'The lights started to change as we were about 10 to15 metres away from . the lights. I looked to the right and by the time I looked left all I . could see was grey and a crunching noise and that's all I remember.' In a victim impact statement he said had . trouble sleeping and was being fed through a tube and a syringe because . of on-going problems with his stomach. Torkington of Halliwell, Bolton, who only . started driving in September 2010, later denied being angry after her . bust up with her partner and denied speeding through the red light . saying it was on amber. She said she had watched Mr Holt play . pool at a pub but after they returned home they had a 'minor . disagreement' after which she drove him to his daughter's house - . leaving her then 14-year-old son to look after her other children. Torkington sobbed: 'I vaguely . remember the disagreement being about my ex. To me an argument is . screaming and shouting at each other.' She added: 'I have a plate in my left . leg, plate in my left arm. I had three broken metatarsals, a torn . spleen, a fractured pelvis. I was cut from front to back. I hit my head . severely. I was in hospital for three weeks.' Following her conviction, Chief . Inspector Rachel Buckle of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This woman . had her life tragically cut short because of the actions of Sheri . Torkington. 'At no point did she admit her guilt and subjected the victim's family to a lengthy trial. 'Torkington disregarded the law and . drove at speed through a red light. Even a split second of carelessness . can have devastating consequences and Torkington has to live with what . she has done for the rest of her life.'","Sheri Torkington, 32, crashed into Laura Farnell's car at a junction .

But cyclist Tim Burton was surprised when he was stopped by police who pulled him over for not sporting the stretchy fabric. An officer considered Mr Burton’s preferred outfit of scruffy jeans and a t-shirt not to be the attire of a serious cyclist – and thought he must have stolen the high-end  bicycle he was riding. Pulled over: Tim Burton was accused of stealing his bike when the . police officer saw that he wasn't wearing expensive cycling clothes . PC Keith James, of Avon and Somerset . Police, explained that because Mr Burton was not clad in Lycra or . wearing a cycling helmet, he was likely to have pinched the £500 bike. But after checking the serial number on the bicycle which confirmed it did belong to Mr Burton, the officer sent him on his way. The 25-year-old cyclist then Tweeted a . picture of the incident in Keynsham, Somerset, writing: ‘Just got . stopped by the police for ‘‘not wearing Lycra’’ but being on a road . bike. He says I wasn’t dressed in appropriate gear for riding my bike so . I had stolen it.’ He went on: ‘I was clipped in. No scruffy trainers but clean(ish) shoes. ‘Maybe I did not look hipster enough?

The bike looks . too good for me to own, obviously! ‘It is nice to see them looking out for pinched bikes, I told the policeman I appreciated it.’ Lycra: Because Tim wasn't wearing expensive cycling clothing, the police officer assumed that he was not the owner of the bike . Explaining his actions PC James later . said: ‘Bike thefts are a priority for us in this area as we’ve had a . number of garage and shed break-ins. ‘I’m a cyclist myself and it was . unusual to see an expensive bike being ridden by someone in non-cycling . clothes and without a helmet.’ He continued: ‘It soon became clear . that Mr Burton was the genuine owner and I’m glad he’s supportive of . what we’re doing to try to catch bike thieves.’ Mr Burton later told his followers on .

In a speech today Nick Clegg will say Tory infighting over Europe and gay marriage has been an 'unwelcome distraction' which is undermining public support for the Government . Nick Clegg today warned the warring Conservative Party to ‘get back to governing’ – as he insisted the Coalition will continue until the bitter end in 2015. In a combative speech that will infuriate Conservative MPs, the Deputy Prime Minister said Tory infighting over Europe and gay marriage has been an ‘unwelcome distraction’ which is undermining public support for the Government. Mr Clegg warned that key Queen’s Speech announcements on issues such as pensions . and long-term care for the elderly, have been obscured by internal . ‘political punch ups’ in the Tory Party. Tory MPs are being ‘consumed by game-playing over . Europe and gay marriage – MPs disappearing into a parliamentary rabbit . warren, obsessing over this new tactic or that new trick: paving . legislation, enabling referendums, wrecking amendments’,' he added. ‘Anyone watching . would be forgiven for asking: what are these politicians doing? So it’s . time to get back to governing – providing the leadership and focus the . people of Britain deserve in these difficult times.’ Mr Cameron hinted at the weekend that . he could dissolve the Coalition and try to continue as a minority . government if relations with the Lib Dems paralyse his administration. The Prime Minister told Total Politics magazine that despite some ‘frustrations’, the coalition remained the best way to get things done. ‘But if that wasn't the case then we'd have to face the new circumstances in whatever way we should,' he added. In a speech today Mr Clegg criticised what he called the ‘rather creative coverage’ of those comments. ‘He echoed exactly what both of us have always believed: this Coalition has been remarkably radical; it still has work to do; and the best way for us to serve and improve Britain is by finishing what we started,’ he said. ‘I am absolutely committed to this coalition lasting until 2015 - as is the Prime Minister.’ Claims that it was in either or both parties' interests to ‘prematurely pull the plug’ were wrong. Voters ‘will not forgive either party if we call time ahead of the election that has been legislated for in 2015 - destabilising the nation in the vague hope of short-term political gain’. Nor would it work for the Lib Dems to try to ‘pull the wool over people's eyes’ and win back critics of the coalition deal by quitting six months early. ‘And, frankly, that isn't what we want. The Liberal Democrats look forward to fighting the next election as a party of government, on our record in government, and with a distinct vision of our own for the next government - having seen this one through until the end. An early election would mean ‘destabilising the nation in the vague hope of short-term political gain’. However the decision to focus on Tory woes comes after Mr Cameron has been rocked by rebellions over gay marriage and Europe in recent days. Relations with traditionalists worsened at the weekend after reports that the party's co-chairman Lord Feldman said MPs were rebelling because of pressure from 'swivel-eyed loons' in Tory associations. Lord Feldman denies the claims . Relations with traditionalists . worsened at the weekend after reports that the party’s co-chairman Lord . Feldman, a close friend of the Prime Minister, said MPs were rebelling . because of pressure from ‘swivel-eyed loons’ in Tory associations. Lord .

Dean Warren, 32, was given a 12-month conditional discharge at Bury St Edmunds Magistrates' Court, pictured, for attacking the new partner of his ex-wife . An angry husband attacked his estranged wife's new lover after assuming he was a burglar when he found him wearing her dressing gown, a court heard. Quantity surveyor Dean Warren, 32, texted his wife Gemma on February 9 to say he wanted to visit her at their former martial home while they were going through a divorce . Bury St Edmunds magistrates heard how he went upstairs and then came down to find his wife's new partner Greg Hayton, 30, sitting in the living room in her dressing gown. Father-of-two Warren asked who he was and Mr Hayton, who had just finished night shift, tried to explain that he had permission to be in the house in Glemsford, Suffolk. Warren then punched him repeatedly in the face and body, causing a bruised nose, forehead and a cut lip as well as marks to his arm. Prosecutor David Bryant said the injuries needed hospital treatment. He added: 'Mr Hayton did not fight back. It was a very one-sided match.' Warren of Lavenham, Suffolk, told police in an interview he believed Mr Hayton had been a burglar. He initially denied assault, but changed his plea to guilty at the last minute and was given a 12 month conditional discharge. Warren was also given a restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Hayton or his wife except through a third party for matters relating to their children. He was ordered to pay £200 compensation to Mr Hayton, court costs of £310 and a £15 victim surcharge. The court heard how Warren had gone to live with his parents after the break-up of his marriage. But he had been left paying rent to his parents as well as the mortgage on his family home, which was 'not financially viable'. Picture perfect: The village of Glemsford, Suffolk, where the attack took place . A solicitor then advised him to return to the family home as it was 'a big asset0'. Declan Gallagher, defending, said: 'When he entered the house, the chap in the dressing gown did not announce himself. 'When they met, there was an instantaneous reaction on Mr Warren's part and a flurry of blows. To find someone in your wife's dressing gown would wind up most people up.'","Dean Warren, 32, hit wife's new partner, Greg Hayton, 30, at marital home .

Friends of Christine Greenslade were shocked to read news of her untimely death at the age of just 34. So they were even more shocked when she got in touch three decades later – to organise a reunion. Mrs Greenslade was very much alive – and oblivious to the fact that a local newspaper had mistakenly announced her death in 1980. In fact it was her mother Pamela who had passed away, but when Christine arranged for the death notice to be published the women’s names were switched. Mrs Greenslade was completely unaware of the error and moved abroad, oblivious to the fact that her schoolfriends in Penzance, Cornwall were grieving. The mistake only came to light when she called her old chums to organise a get-together. Now a 66-year-old artist living in France, she was preparing to revisit her childhood home and contacted friends from St Gertrude’s Convent. She explained: ‘I got in touch with Viv Albright and she sounded very odd. It wasn’t quite the reception I was expecting from an old friend. ‘She rang me back and said “I’m terribly sorry, but we all thought you were dead”. ‘Looking back I was in a bit of a state when I rang the newspaper because I’d just lost my mum. ‘But I can remember the man specifically asking for mother’s name at the start of the call, and then asking for mine at the end. ‘At the time I was Christine Downing and she was a Greenslade – so it seemed impossible to mix up the two names. ‘But there it was “Christine . Greenslade has died, leaving three children and a husband”.’ Mrs . Greenslade is due to travel to Penzance from her home in western France . next week. Old friends: Christine Greenslade (second from right) is seen as a 16-year-old with her former classmates (l-r) Audrey Upton, Viv Albright, Jane Woodall and Linda Turney . The separated mother of two said . yesterday: ‘It’s very sad to think that they mourned me all those years . but at least I’ve got plenty to tell them. ‘This whole experience has made me . realise just how lucky I have been to be alive all these years and to . have crammed so much into my life.’ Another of Mrs Greenslade’s friends, Jane Johnson, 66, said: ‘In 1980 Viv told me there was a report in the newspaper. ‘It said that Chris was dead which was absolutely awful. Then I got this call saying she was alive. I could barely believe it. ‘To see her after all those years, . when I thought that she was dead and I had been mourning her, it is just . amazing.’ She added: ‘I had always thought of her, particularly on her . birthday, and I have missed her terribly. ‘To lose all those years is awful but now we’re going to try to make up for lost time.’ The bungled obituary appeared in The Cornishman, a Penzance-based newspaper which has been printed once a week since 1878. Yesterday the acting editor Richard . Whitehouse said: ‘It’s always unfortunate when any mix-ups occur in a . newspaper. And it is especially unfortunate when a mix-up remains . unresolved for so long. ‘But The Cornishman is pleased that it has been able to announce to the world that Christine is alive and kicking. ‘Hopefully she can enjoy reacquainting herself with friends who thought she was no longer alive.’","Christine Greenslade and her family moved away from Cornish hometown .

A new Microsoft ad has taken a direct jab at Apple, the latest salvo in the tense tablet war between the two tech giants. Turning up the snark, the 30-second ad features a side-by-side comparison of the two computers, an iPad on the left and the Microsoft Windows 8 tablet on the right. The commercial features Apple’s Siri, the voice recognition software that Apple first unveiled in the iPhone 4S in 2011. Two for one: Microsoft tries in the ad to hammer home the point that iPad's cannot display to apps on the screen at once . 'Sorry, I don't update like that,' the voice says in Siri's signature tone as the Windows 8 tablet displays a video and email at the same time. The voice continues: 'I'm sorry, I can only do one thing at a time.' 'I guess PowerPoint isn't one of those things,' the mock Siri adds, hammering home the fact that Apple devices don't feature Microsoft apps. Apparently giving up, 'Siri' asks: 'Should we just play chopsticks?' - an apparent dig at the iPad commercial . where a user plays the song on the iPad's Garage Band app in a past iPad ad. Competition: The Microsoft ad also makes the point that the iPad does not feature the tech giants signature apps like PowerPoint . Getting personal: Apparently giving up, the mock Siri asks: 'Should we just play chopsticks?' - an apparent dig at the iPad commercial where a user plays the song on the iPad's Garage Band app in a past iPad ad . The ad then makes its final argument with a price comparison - $699 for the 64 GB iPad and $449 for the Windows 8 tablet. Despite Microsoft's argument, Apple does not appear to be losing ground in the tablet wars, as the Windows 8 tablet received less-than-stellar reviews and has so far failed to measure up to the hype and sales of the similar Apple and Google devices. Critics, as well as some consumers, lambasted the technology giant over Windows 8, mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of Microsoft's trademark 'Start' button. While Microsoft has experienced growth in recent years, any success is eclipsed by Apple, which unveiled the iPad Mini at about the same time as Windows 8. Let's talk price: At the conclusion of the ad, Microsoft delivers a price comparison - $250 less than the 64GB iPad . Some reviewers liked the way Windows 8 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years. But others say it's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed to the older versions, particularly when they switch to desktop mode and don't see the familiar 'start' button and menu. Struck by the flurry of complaints, Microsoft announced earlier this month that it was giving Windows 8 a makeover, known as Windows Blue.","Thirty-second commercial features side-by-side comparison of the two computers .

A 21-year-old graduate student missing since late last week has been found safe and unharmed several states from where his family were expecting him authorities say, but exactly where, they refuse to say. Matthew Royer, a University of Rhode Island doctorate student, was found in North Carolina on Thursday, WPVI reports, after his parents say he set out from the school for their Pennsylvania home one week earlier. He has since been reunited with family in an undisclosed location with a cause for his mysterious disappearance also left unsaid. Found: Matthew Royer, 21, who was missing for exactly one week before found on Thursday is seen in an undated photo released by the Pennsylvania State Police during their search efforts . 'The family requests that the media not contact them nor reveal his location as they wish to consider this a private and closed matter,' a statement by State Police said on Thursday. In state police's last search update on Monday they said it was possible Royer 'voluntarily' disappeared. They didn't say exactly why but that they were 'pursuing all leads,' ABC reported at the time. A university spokeswoman said Royer, who was studying pharmacy, hadn't been taking any classes last semester but was still registered as a student. His mother told police she was expecting him home for summer break where he’d work at a golf club in Pennsylvania starting that Friday. Mystery: Royer told his mother on Thursday night that he was heading home with plans to start a summer job at a Pennsylvania golf club on Friday which he failed to show up for . When he didn’t show up for work that day, she called police, launching the manhunt that spread throughout the northeast. Janet Royer told police he sent her a text message around 6.30pm on Thursday telling her that he was heading home, an about five-hour drive, after oversleeping. Leading up to disappearance: Royer was pursing a doctorate in pharmacy at the University of Rhode Island but hadn't been taking classes this past semester according to a university spokeswoman . At 2.05am the next morning he was instead seen leaving a gas station near Allentown, Pennsylvania, just 35 miles north of his family's home. 'He bought water at the station, he opened it in the car and headed southbound on 100. He looked fine, not distraught,' his mother, Janet Royer, told ABC News' Philadelphia affiliate. Roughly 11 hours later at 1pm his vehicle, a silver 2008 Chevy Cobalt, was reported driving only an hour away from his home in Lebanon County. Who was behind the wheel wasn't known. Fuelling his family's worst fears, authorities said his cell phone stopped working around noon on Saturday. 'You couldn't ask for a better son. It's not like him, if he wasn't coming home he would've told me he wasn't coming home, unless he couldn't,' his mother, Janet Royer told WPVI on Sunday. Royer had moved most of his belongings out of his apartment near the University of Rhode Island a few weeks prior to his disappearance. His family says he still had some items packed in his vehicle when he disappeared, including a laptop computer and other electronic devices. The owner of his apartment told police he returned his keys before leaving. Royer's family says he has a good relationship with everyone, and would have no reason to run away.","Matthew Royer, 21, was found in North Carolina after expected home in Pennsylvania last Friday according to reports .

The FBI investigated the classic song 'Louie Louie' for two years, it has been revealed.

The song, sung by the Kingsmen, has notoriously mumbled lyrics that are difficult to make out. But according to FBI files, a teacher from Sarasota High School, in Florida, wrote to them in February 1964 to insist something was done to 'stamp out this menace'. The teacher, whose name has been redacted from the files, said: 'Who do you turn to when your teenage daughter buys and bring home . pornographic or obscene materials being sold along with objects directed . and aimed at the teenage market in every City, Village and Record shop . in this Nation? 'My daughter brought home a record of ‘Louie Louie ‘ and I, after . reading that the record had been banned from being played on the air . because it was obscene, proceeded to try to decipher the jumble of . words.

A cover letter addressed to the FBI laboratory which analysed the song described it as 'a calypso-type song' that was 'very popular with the high school students'. It added: 'The words are hard to recognise.' Analysts spent two years playing the record at different speeds but were unable to come to a decision on what the words were.

Disgraced democrat Anthony Weiner’s campaign to become the next mayor of New York got off to an embarrassing start on Thursday after it was revealed that his website featured an image of Pittsburgh’s skyline rather than Manhattan. Native New Yorker Weiner, 48, launched his campaign on Tuesday when he released a video in which he sought to portray himself as the champion of the outer boroughs and the middle class. Weiner, forced to resign from politics two years ago after an embarrassing sexting scandal, grew up in Brooklyn and had previously represented parts of Brooklyn and Queens in Congress. Bad day: Weiner's credentials as a native New Yorker took a bashing after his website was revealed to be using an image of Pittsburgh as its backdrop . People familiar with Pittsburgh's skyline recognised it as the original backdrop for Weiner's campaign website . The Roberto Clemente Bridge in Pittsburgh, which was mistakenly used as an image of New York . The inaccurate image was first spotted by animator Richard Lampasone who tweeted: ‘I love to be reminded of Pittsburgh every time I visit @anthonyweiner's website and see a huge image of it above the campaign logo.’ At a quick glance, the image on Weiner’s website header might be mistaken for one of New York’s iconic bridges, but it is in fact the Roberto Clemente Bridge in Pittsburgh. Weiner’s team haven’t commented on the embarrassing mistake, but his website has been updated twice on Thursday, first to a generic skyline image and then to a collage of five images from New York’s boroughs. The company responsible for the website, NGP VAN, has admitted that the mistake was theirs. ‘This is our fault,’ VP of Marketing John Brougher told NBC4. ‘Our designer got the image from a set of images that included New York City images, but obviously this image was not of New York City, as the Weiner campaign had requested.’ Weiner's website was initially changed to display a rather generic image of a city skyline . The latest version of Weiner's website features five different images from throughout the five boroughs of New York City . Thursday was the former congressman's first official day of . campaigning. 'There’s no doubt about it: I made . very big mistakes,' he told WNYC, referring to the tawdry tweets . that led to his resignation from Congress in 2011. 'I compounded it immeasurably by being dishonest about . it. 'I have apologized . many, many times to my wife, and frankly I know that part of this . process is going to be doing a lot of apologizing.' Weiner . resigned from Congress after it was revealed that he had sent several . women inappropriate photos of himself, including one of a bulge in his . pants and another of him topless in his Capitol Hill office. He called . the behavior a 'blind spot' and said 'it was a thoughtlessness that I . had about my private behavior.' Weiner's wife, longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, has forgiven him - but she hasn't forgotten, he revealed. 'I . put her through some difficult things,' Weiner admitted. 'She says it’s . in the rear view mirror — but it’s not far in the rear view mirror.'

Weiner stands surrounded by reporters and a few commuters on a 2 train headed to Times Square . But that might change if more details of the scandal come forward in the course of his campaign - something Weiner has repeatedly warned could happen. 'It is what it is,' Weiner said. 'People may decide they want to come forward and say, here’s another email that I got or another photo. I’m certainly not going to do that. So people may hear things that are true, they may hear things that are not true, but I’m going to try to keep being focused on issues that are important to New York City.' Weiner made the remarks as he set out . Thursday to reintroduce himself to voters, following the release of his . first official campaign video that featured his toddler son and . targeted middle class voters.

The father of America's 2,000th military fatality in Afghanistan has paid a moving tribute to his fallen son, telling how he had been 'proud to serve his country'. Army Sergeant First Class Daniel Metcalfe, 29, from Liverpool, N.Y., himself a father-of-three, was killed in an attack on an Afghan army checkpoint in Wardak province on Saturday. His father, Tom Metcalfe, said his son had been on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan, when he became the apparent latest victim in a spate of insider or 'green on blue' attacks. Fallen hero: Army Sergeant First Class Daniel Metcalfe, 29, from . Liverpool, N.Y., is the 2,000th US military fatality in Afghanistan . As he drove to Dover Air Force Base to meet his son’s remains, Mr Metcalfe told Rochetser's WHAM TV: 'He was proud to serve his country. 'I hated to lose him, knew that was always a possibility, but he was a good man.' Sergeant Metcalfe served with the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team who are based in Vicenza, Italy. According to the casualty report, he died in Wardak province's Sayyid Abad district when his unit came under attack by small-arms fire. A Nato statement read: 'The incident occurred while an ISAF unit was manning a temporary check point in an area near an Afghan National Army unit. 'According to ISAF and ANA reporting, after a short conversation took place between ANA and ISAF personnel firing occurred which resulted in the fatal wounding of an ISAF soldier and the death of his civilian colleague. 'In an ensuing exchange of fire three ANA personnel are reported to have died. ' Ultimate sacrifice: Sergeant Metcalfe's wife Vesna, (centre) is seen holding one of their three children, 11-month-old Ethan, as the family attend a memorial service in his honor . Tribute: Sergeant Metcalfe's Aunt Dorothy Nerges, walks with two of his children, Alexis, 6 and Ethan,11-months, as the Patriot Guard Riders of New York turn out to pay their respects before a memorial service . According to Shahidullah Shahid, a provincial government spokesman, two Afghan soldiers were also killed in the attack. Speaking immediately after the incident Mr Shahid said an Afghan soldier had turned his gun on the Americans and started shooting. He said: 'Initial reports indicate that a misunderstanding happened between Afghan army soldiers and American soldiers.' Afghan soldiers and policemen - or militants in their uniforms - have gunned down more than 50 foreign troops so far this year, eroding the trust between coalition forces and their Afghan partners. An equal number of Afghan policemen and soldiers also died in these attacks, giving them reason as well to be suspicious of possible infiltrators within their ranks. The attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces, prompting the US military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units earlier this month.

Costs: The program to train and equip 350,000 Afghan policemen and soldiers has cost the American taxpayer more than $22 billion in the past three years . The close contact - with coalition forces working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers, mentors and trainers - is a key part of the US strategy for putting the Afghans in the lead as the US and other nations prepare to pull out their last combat troops at the end of 2014, just 27 months away. The first 33,000 U.S. troops withdrew by the end of September, leaving 68,000 still in Afghanistan. A decision on how many U.S. troops will remain next year will be taken after the American presidential elections. Nato currently has 108,000 troops in Afghanistan — including U.S. forces — down from nearly 150,000 at its peak last year.

Ed Balls says he is ‘more bothered’ about passing a Grade 8 exam on the piano than serving in the next Labour cabinet. The shadow chancellor he would ‘love’ to be a part of a future Labour government but that it is not an . ‘all-consuming passion’ for him. Mr Balls is widely regarded as one of . the most ambitious figures in Westminster, but in an interview with the . Yorkshire Post he says he has already achieved enough that his next . career move is not his priority. ‘I would love to be part of Ed’s . Labour government but what I do next for me is not an all-consuming . passion. 'I’m more bothered, in a personal sense, about getting to grade 8 . piano by the time I’m 50.’ Mr Balls, who is 46, took his grade 1 exam last year and passed his grade two a couple of months ago. Asked about his leadership ambitions, . Mr Balls said: ‘I’ve played an important role in making the Bank of . England independent and the Every Child Matters agenda in education. ‘I’ve done enough things which I know . have made things better, or good, in our country to not feel as though . the most important thing is what I do next in my career.’ He added: ‘The danger for a politician . is always that you worry that once you’ve gone your epitaph will say . “hopes unfulfilled” but I think mine would be “he did some good things . and he did his best” and that’s enough.’ Mr Balls used the interview to warn that Labour should not rule out holding a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU. He said it is ‘economically very . dangerous’ for David Cameron to call for a referendum by 2017 ‘because . it leads to great instability and uncertainty’. Key change: The shadow chancellor has made steady progress with his piano lessons, which he demonstrated at last year's Labour conference . Sour note: Mr Balls claims he could do a better job than George Osborne at tuning up the economy . But he added: ‘I don’t think we should . set our face against a referendum and I certainly don’t think we can . ever afford to give the impression that we know better than the voting . public and that we’re going to carry on regardless.’ Mr Balls also admitted that the last . Labour government got it wrong on immigration by not restricting . immigrants from Eastern Europe in 2004. ‘The problem for Labour is the . perception, and there’s some truth in this perception, that the controls . weren’t tough enough,’ he said. ‘When they joined the EU, we didn’t . have the transitional controls and that was a mistake. ‘Also, we didn’t . do enough to enforce the minimum wage to make sure the agency workers . coming from Eastern Europe couldn’t be brought in to do the same job, . undercutting the wages of people in the same workplace. That caused us a . big problem at the last election, there’s no doubt about that.’ Duo: There has been speculation that Mr Balls might not remain in charge of Labour economic policy under Ed Miliband right up to the next election . Hobbies: The Labour heavyweight is also a keen cook and has run the London marathon twice . Mr Balls also conceded that Labour has yet to convince voters it can be trusted with the economy. ‘We haven’t won that argument yet, but both George Osborne and David Cameron have lost the argument,’ he said. A spokesman for Mr Balls said that he . is very keen to become the next Chancellor and that his comments were . intended to indicate that he is more interested in the piano than being . Labour leader rather than serving in another Cabinet. ‘It’s pretty clear what he would like to do on that front,’ the spokesman said.","Shadow chancellor insists serving in Ed Miliband government is not an 'all-consuming passion'

Fugitive Diane Gibson, 72, fled in 2000 after being caught 3kg of the drug worth £240,000. Detectives feared the woman - dubbed 'Britain's most wanted grandmother' - may have changed her appearance and fled to Spain. But police officers found her on Tuesday at her daughter's home near Yate, Bristol, and arrested the pensioner after a 12-and-a-half year fight to evade justice. She appeared at Bristol Crown Court later the same day along with a number of family members, including reality star Josie, who attended to support her. She was convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to supply in 2000 but went on the run before she was sentenced. The elderly fugitive, who now has mobility issues, is thought to have spent the majority of the past decade living in the north. Nicholas O'Brien, prosecuting, said Gibson was convicted in June 2000 at Bristol Crown Court before Judge Lester Boothman. He said: 'She was put back for sentence and for a Proceeds of Crime Application (POCA) to be considered. She refused to comply with the POCA. 'The court adjourned sentence to the October and she failed to attend and has been absent ever since. 'She was found by police in the house of a family member in Yate. The house has been sold, though completion is yet to be reached. Big Brother star: Josie Gibson won the reality television show in 2010 while her grandmother Diane was still on the run after being caught in possession of £240,000 worth of cocaine . 'Consideration is being made as to whether anyone will be prosecuted for assisting an offender.' Gibson . was initially arrested in 1999. Police officers were watching a Little . Chef in Kent when they saw her and a man in a Ford Mondeo behaving . suspiciously in the car park. They tailed the Mondeo as it headed towards Bristol on the M25 before pulling it over on the M4 near Swindon. Big Brother star: Josie Gibson was in court yesterday as her grandmother appeared before a judge . She told officers she was carrying a . number of rare books, but a search of the boot revealed a handbag . containing 3kg of cocaine. The . man in the car was acquitted of wrongdoing, but a gang of conspirators . were convicted and served jail terms ranging from 18 months to five . years. Police launched a high-profile hunt to find Gibson and she was described by Detective Constable Paul Kerrod as 'an evil woman who was determined to bring cocaine into this country and distribute it'. The officer said in 2003 they would never give up the hunt for her: 'We won't give up - and I don't care if she's 65 or 75, because we will get her,' he said. Giles Nelson, defending Gibson this week, said his client had not accepted her conviction and wanted to appeal it. He said at the time she was distraught, having lost a second daughter in quick concession. Mr Nelson added: 'She has been in the north of England, having returned recently to Yate. 'She is in poor health, has obvious mobility issues, a kidney and haemorrhaging problem.' Judge Longman remanded the pensioner in custody until May 9. Gibson told the judge: 'I don't even know those people,' referring to members of the convicted drugs gang. Her granddaughter Josie, who won Big Brother 11 in 2010, said: 'I can't say anything about it.' In 2010 relatives told a national newspaper Josie rarely saw her grandmother while growing up. Diane's daughter Kay Gibson - the aunt Josie lived with in Westerleigh, said: 'Josie was too young to remember when it happened. 'I imagine she will have mentioned it to Big Brother. But we haven't discussed it. The whole thing tore the family apart, but over time we've learned to deal with it. We never talk about it now.'","Diane Gibson, 72, the grandmother of Josie Gibson went on the run in 2000 .

It has been standing for 600 years, but the future of Britain's oldest shop is shrouded in doubt today after it was put up for sale. Historians have discovered the post office and stores in a tiny community of Boxford, Suffolk, was originally used as a warehouse for buying and selling wool and fabric as long ago as 1420. Over the following centuries the building has been home for butchers, grocers, ironmongers and drapers and since the start of the last century it has been a successful general store and post office. Sub-Postmaster Richard Gates outside Boxford Stores in Suffolk which has been put up for sale. It has been standing in the village for 600 years . Under threat: The shop in 1930. Historians have discovered it was opened as a warehouse in 1420 . Unchanged: Boxford Stores today, barely any different, apart from a splash of paint, to what it was hundreds of years ago . Coincidentally, the village is also home to Britain's oldest garage, Riddelsdells, but the future of one of the venerable businesses is now in doubt after the 94-year-old owner of the village shop died and its executors put it on the market. Sub-postmaster Richard Gates said: 'We all hope the new owner keeps the shop open, There has been a lot of interest in the Stores - it would be perfect for someone like a burnt-out banker who wants to do something else. 'It has become part of the village landscape and we get customers who have been coming in for all their lives. 'They started as children buying penny sweets on their way to school and now they collect their old age pensions here.' Mr Gates, 68, who has managed the post office for 15 years, added: 'Most things you need in life can still be bought in the village - we have a paper shop, general store and a butchers .

'The nearest other post office is at least six miles away in any direction so we would like to see it kept as a going concern - and I'd like to carry on looking after the post office.' But the five-bedroomed property will need complete renovation - nothing has been done to it since it was bought by retired Army Major John Gaussen and his wife Christina fifty years ago. As it is a Grade Two listed commercial premises any change of use would have to be approved by the local district council - who are notoriously keen on preserving the character of old buildings. Major Gaussen died in 1997 and his wife eight years ago at the age of 89 when the Stores was left to Mrs Gaussen's elderly sister Catherine Lee, a spinster who lived eight miles away in Lavenham. She allowed the staff of three to carry on running the place but now after her death 15 months ago aged 94, the executors of her will are keen to sell and settle her estate. The heavily-timbered building - which has changed little in appearance for several centuries, also contains a remarkable unaltered two-storey barn.

Into the colour age, possibly in the 1960s, and shop is still standing . Bills from the 1870's show the shop, apart from selling general groceries such as biscuits , cheese from Holland, sugar, loose tea and shag tobacco, was also a thriving hardware business which stocked stoves, brushes, carpets, carriage varnish, shot and hair oil. In the early 20th century Buck Riddleston - whose family also owned the village garage - extended the range of goods on offer to include clothes, dresses, shirts, stockings suspenders. However Boxford Stores is now on the market and village's population of 1,200 is anxious and hoping that it will continue in its present form as a deli, fruit and vegetable shop and sub post office. Boxford Society archivist Tina Loose said: 'It is an extraordinarily well-preserved building and much of it remains unchanged. 'It has been part of village life for centuries and there is a door in the shop that is covered in masses of signatures of the people who have worked there over the years.' Medieval buildings expert Leigh Alston, who examined the property, said: 'It may well have served as a building containing market stall or shops within arcaded walls while the rear contained workshops and warehousing.' Architectural historian Mr Alston, who teaches at Cambridge University, said: 'The building contains any number of exceptional features which had they all survived would represent a rare survival from the Tudor world. The cars are different today but the shop hasn't altered a great deal . It is doubtful the shop would have sold the array of goods it does today even 20 years ago, let alone 100 . 'Bridge House remains among the most fascinating and beguiling buildings in a county which is justly famed for them.' The lime-washed property - which includes five-bed living accommodation - is now up for sale through agents Jackson Stops and Staff for £565,000. Partner Tim Dansie said: 'It would make a lovely home as well as a unique business opportunity in a remarkable historic building.' Boxford, from where the Pilgrim Fathers left for America in 1620, also boasts Britain's oldest garage - once run by the same family who owned the post office stores. Riddelsdells opened in 1900 when it looked after steam-driven cars and mended farm carts.

A crooked financial controller who lived in a mansion owned by Carol Vorderman has been jailed after she stole £1.5 million from her employers to fund a life of luxury. Wendy Nichols, 49, siphoned cash from company accounts and used it to pay for flash cars, foreign holidays and even plastic surgery for herself and one of her daughters. The mother-of-two rented a palatial apartment at Sloblock Hall, a £5 million country mansion in North Somerset owned by TV presenter Carol Vorderman. Northampton Crown Court heard Nichols also bought her daughters plush BMW cars, paid for them to go to a private boarding school and splashed out on a £200,000 flat for one of them. Nichols - who turned up to court wearing a figure-hugging dress - covered her tracks by altering records and using the name of an ex-employee to authorise fraudulent transactions. Between 2006 and August 2012 she stole a total of £1,537,608 from Logistex, based in Kettering. She pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to theft and false accounting and on Wednesday she was jailed for five-a-and-a-half years. Jailing Nichols, Judge Richard Bray told her she had breached the trust of her employer, where she had worked for ten years. He said: 'You used your position to defraud your employer over a period of six years. 'It is amazing to me that this was not detected sooner. The money was spent on the most blatant luxuries.' Landlord: Nichols siphoned £1.5million from her employers and lived in Carol Vorderman's £5million mansion in Somerset . Elizabeth Gooderham, prosecuting, said Nichols was rumbled when the financial director at her firm noticed an unusually large transaction and traced it to her personal account. Further investigations revealed dozens of similar deposits from company funds. Mrs Gooderham told the court: 'The money was being spent on regular trips to department stores, holidays to New York, Dubai and Tenerife and cosmetic surgery for Nichols and one of her daughters. 'She bought her daughters a BMW Mini and BMW X3, she also paid for them to go to a private boarding school and bought one of them a flat in Glasgow which cost more than £200,000. 'It was an extravagant lifestyle not borne out by someone on a salary of between £50,000 and £60,000.' Convicted: Nichols bought BMW cars, a flat in Glasgow for her daughter, and luxury holidays with the money she stole . Maxine Krone, defending, said Nichols felt she had 'created a monster' during the thefts, and had initially intended to pay the money back. She added: 'She is ashamed of herself and of the breach of trust.' Mrs Krone said Nichols had arrived in court with her suitcase already packed as she fully expected a prison sentence. Speaking after the case, Det Con Andy Hewitt, from Northamptonshire Police, said: 'The next stage will be for a Proceeds of Crime hearing, to see if some of the money can be recovered.' A date for the hearing has yet to be set. Lawyer Julie Vickers, speaking on behalf of Logistex, said: 'Wendy Nichols was employed by Logistex for almost ten years and held a senior financial management position. 'We placed our trust in her in a role that required honesty and professionalism. 'At no time in that period did we have reason to doubt the integrity and trust we placed in her. 'It is therefore with great disappointment that we have discovered the theft. Guilty: Nichols pleaded guilty in Northampton Crown Court. the defence said that she felt ashamed of what she had done . 'She breached the trust we placed in her by systematically stealing money from the company over an extended period of time. 'As soon as the theft became known to the company we moved quickly to resolve the problem and Wendy Nichols was removed from her position. 'Logistex remains financially robust.'","Wendy Nichols, 49, siphoned £1.5milion from company accounts .

Video footage released yesterday shows . police surrounding Moran’s home in the resort of Calpe near Alicante . before chasing him into bushes after he spotted one of the officers and . tried to escape.

He has been on the run since vaulting . over the dock during his trial at Burnley Crown Court in February 2009. He was convicted in his absence, and he was later placed on . Crimestoppers’ top-ten most wanted list. Since fleeing to Spain, Moran moved . around frequently and assumed false identities in a bid to evade . capture. He regularly changed his appearance, growing a moustache and . his hair, and sometimes wore spectacles. Last year he narrowly avoided being . caught by ramming two police cars with his 4x4 and hurtling down a . motorway the wrong way. A search of the house he was living in at the . time uncovered a handgun, ammunition and 5kg of cannabis. He charted his life on the run with . photos of himself in various locations and poses. One picture showed him . in front of the  Eiffel Tower in Paris and he posed for another with . two Uzi machine guns.

Astronomers have found two 'dead' stars they say give us a chilling glimpse into the future for our solar system. The dead stars are located 150 light-years from Earth in a relatively young star cluster, Hyades, in the constellation Taurus. The star cluster is only 625 million . years old, and the white dwarfs are being polluted by asteroid-like . debris falling onto them, turning them into 'dirty' stars. An artist's impression of a white dwarf (burned-out) star observed by Hubble in the Hyades star cluster. At lower right, an asteroid can be seen falling toward a Saturn-like disk of dust that is encircling the dead star . Our Sun will expand outwards when its nuclear fuel runs low and will ultimately blow off its outer layers. Some of the inner planets will be consumed in the process and asteroids will be thrown out of their orbits. Asteroids that veer too close to the sun will be broken up, and the debris could be pulled into a ring around the dead sun. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope found the building blocks for Earth-sized planets in an unlikely place- the atmospheres of a pair of burned-out stars called white dwarfs, which are the exhausted cores of average-size stars not unlike our Sun. 'We have identified chemical evidence . for the building blocks of rocky planets,' said Jay Farihi of the . University of Cambridge in England. He is lead author of a new study appearing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 'When these stars were born, they built planets, and there's a good chance they currently retain some of them. 'The material we are seeing is evidence of this. 'The debris is at least as rocky as the most primitive terrestrial bodies in our solar system.' Hubble's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observed silicon and only low levels of carbon in the white dwarfs' atmospheres. Silicon is a major ingredient of the rocky material that constitutes Earth and other solid planets in our solar system. Carbon, which helps determine properties and origin of planetary debris, generally is depleted or absent in rocky, Earth-like material. This discovery suggests rocky planet assembly is common around stars, and it offers insight into what will happen in our own solar system when our sun burns out 5 billion years from now. In around 5 billion years, our Sun will expand outwards when its nuclear fuel runs low and will ultimately blow off its outer layers . Farihi's research suggests asteroids less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide probably were torn apart by the white dwarfs' strong gravitational forces. Asteroids are thought to consist of the same materials that form terrestrial planets, and seeing evidence of asteroids points to the possibility of Earth-sized planets in the same system. The pulverized material may have been pulled into a ring around the stars and eventually funneled onto the dead stars. The silicon may have come from asteroids that were shredded by the white dwarfs' gravity when they veered too close to the dead stars. 'It's difficult to imagine another mechanism than gravity that causes material to get close enough to rain down onto the star,' Farihi said. Hubble Space Telescope is seen in this picture taken from Space Shuttle in March 2002. It was used to spot the two 'dead' stars . By the same token, when our sun burns out, the balance of gravitational forces between the sun and Jupiter will change, disrupting the main asteroid belt, Nasa says. Asteroids that veer too close to the sun will be broken up, and the debris could be pulled into a ring around the dead sun. According to Farihi, using Hubble to analyze the atmospheres of white dwarfs is the best method for finding the signatures of solid planet chemistry and determining their composition. 'Normally, white dwarfs are like blank pieces of paper, containing only the light elements hydrogen and helium,' Farihi said. 'Heavy elements like silicon and carbon sink to the core. 'The one thing the white dwarf pollution technique gives us that we just won't get with any other planet-detection technique is the chemistry of solid planets.' Fahiri's team plans to analyze more white dwarfs using the same technique to identify not only the rocks' composition, but also their parent bodies.","Dead stars are located 150 light-years from Earth in a relatively young star cluster, Hyades, in the constellation Taurus ."

Defending response time: Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne said the first officers were on scene within nine minutes of the 999 call . Police sought to defend their response to the Woolwich terror attack last night by suggesting the attackers could have laid a trap. Commanders at Scotland Yard suspected the savage killers were waiting for officers to arrive so they could set off hidden explosives. This is why they chose to send in firearms officers who did not arrive at the scene of the carnage for 14 minutes. That left their uniformed colleagues to stand on the sidelines while three brave women confronted the killers. Local officers had taken nine minutes to arrive, even though Woolwich police station was 300 yards away. They waited helplessly as dozens of bystanders milled around the scene of horror and traffic continued to flow. Even after police marksmen fired shots at the terrorists, members of the public could be seen yards away. Last night, one Metropolitan Police source said: ‘The unarmed officers were effectively keeping a cordon. Both guys were wearing heavy coats and keeping a distance between us and them was a priority. Scroll down for video . Waiting for police: Witnesses said this blood-covered man, named as Michael Adebolajo, walked the street clutching weapons and talking to passers-by with cameras for up to 20 minutes before officers arrived . Stayed put: Onlookers said the suspected attackers walked around the body while they waited for police . Conversation: Another suspected attacker holding a knife speaks to Cub Scout leader Ingrid Loyau-Kennett who tried to persuade him to hand over his weapons . No cordon: It was a while after armed police arrived and shot two men (one circled right) before officers cordoned off the area around the soldier's body (circled left) ‘Questions were immediately asked . about why you would commit such an offence and wait for police. These . are the kind of tactics seen employed by Palestinians in Israel. ‘Detonate a bomb, wait for the emergency services to arrive and then walk in with a suicide vest.’ Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrnet said unarmed officers arrived . at John Wilson Street within nine minutes of the first of hundreds of . 999 calls to flood into their control room. It is understood that among the officers was at least one armed with a Taser but he was told to stand by. The officers radioed developments to . senior staff who were able to watch the tense stand-off via a CCTV . camera mounted on a traffic island. On patrol: Soldiers outside Woolwich Barracks today, just 200 yards from the murder scene . Army base: Despite its close proximity to the scene, it appears soldiers at the barracks were unaware of the incident on Wednesday afternoon .

Handwritten: Flowers and notes were left at the scene in Woolwich in honour of the dead soldier . When their armed colleagues finally arrived, witnesses described how the men suddenly aggressively ran at them. 'Police just stood there. It was only after shots were fired that officers appeared and started shouting at everyone to ""get back""' Eyewitness . One of the men attempted to fire a revolver, which misfired and injured his hand. The other wielded a meat cleaver. Several shots were fired and both men, . one of whom is in a serious condition, were last night under armed . guard in separate London hospitals. One eyewitness said: ‘It was surreal. Many people did not even realise what had taken place and thought it was . a car crash. Police just stood there. It was only after shots were . fired that officers appeared and started shouting at everyone to “get . back”.’ Scotland Yard said it took four minutes for armed officers to be assigned and ten minutes for them to arrive. Protest: Mr Byrne called for calm after police clashed with English Defence League members in Woolwich last night . Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said it was a ‘good decision’ to wait for armed response officers to confront the men. He said the Met expects armed officers to respond to incidents in around 12 minutes, but they can be delayed by traffic. 'If those guys had run amok it could have been a completely different story. Instead they stood there and effectively attempted suicide by cop' John Tully, Metropolitan Police Federation chair . This figure contrasts with statistics . from Greater Manchester Police which show armed officers arrive at . incidents, on average, in less than four minutes. John Tully, chair of the Metropolitan . Police Federation, said the speed of armed response vehicles was a ‘big . issue’ in London policing. ‘If you go back to the mid-1980s every . division had a cadre of firearms trained officers and there would be . weapons kept at stations,’ he added. ‘If there was an incident the . inspector would assign qualified people to get a weapon and go to it.

Three days before it slammed it slammed into a mountainside, Nasa's Ebb spacecraft took this video as it hurtled 6 miles above the northern hemisphere of the Moon's far side. The video was recorded by the GRAIL mission's MoonKAM (Moon Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) which sent back images to U.S. schools as part of an outreach project. Desolate: The surface of the Moon as seen from the rear-facing camera of Nasa's Ebb spacecraft just days before it ended its mission by spectacularly crash landing into a mountain on the far side of the lunar surface . Flying in formation over the lunar surface, the two NASA probes - named Ebb and Flow - helped further our understanding of the early solar system. But last month, in a dramatic climax to their mission, the two spacecraft plunged seconds apart into a mountain near the moon's North Pole. The first clip in the video was taken by Ebb's forward-facing camera and is made up of 931 individual frames. The second was taken from its rear camera and is comprised of 1498 frames. After the crash landing on December . 17, NASA said it had dedicated the impact site in honour of mission team . member, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, who died earlier . this year.

Heavenly bodies: An artist's depiction of the twin spacecraft (Ebb and Flow) that comprise NASA's Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. Mapping the moon: Using a precision formation-flying technique, the twin GRAIL spacecraft -- Ebb and Flow -- have mapped the Moon's gravity field, as depicted in this artist's rendering. By design, the spot was far away from the Apollo landings and other historical sites. And even the keenest stargazer would . not have spotted the two-washing machine sized probes as they impacted . at a speed of 3,800mph, as the collisions occurred on the dark side of . moon. Honouring: NASA said it had dedicated the impact . site in honour of Sally Ride, the first American . woman in space, who died earlier this year . But NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance . Orbiter which circles the moon will soon be passing over the site and . will attempt to photograph the skid marks after the craft slammed into . the surface. The mission, codenamed Grail - . Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - was launched in September . 2011 from Cape Canaveral and has been deemed a success. The twin craft collected data about . the moon's gravity while orbiting at an average altitude of 34 miles, . revealing its surface is much thinner than previously thought, gouged . out by the impact of thousands of asteroids and comets. 'It is going to be difficult to say . goodbye to our little robotic twins,' says MIT professor Maria Zuber, . Grail principal investigator. 'Planetary science has advanced in a major . way because of their contributions.' Ebb and Flow conducted one final . experiment before their mission ends, firing their main engines until . their propellant tanks are empty in a bid to determine precisely the . amount of fuel left in their tanks. NASA engineers hope this information will help improve predictions of fuel needs for future missions. 'Our lunar twins may be in the . twilight of their operational lives, but one thing is for sure, they are . going down swinging,' said Grail project manager David Lehman of NASA's . Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Trajectory: The twin lunar-orbiting NASA spacecrafts went on a controlled crash into a site named after Sally Ride . Crash landing site: The map shows the region where the twin spacecraft of NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission will impact on Monday . A successful mission: The map created by Ebb and Flow has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust, suggesting the moon, Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus were pounded by long-ago impacts far more violently than previously thought. Blast Off: The $496 million Grail mission - short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - launched in September 2011, and Ebb and Flow reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later. 'Even during the last half of their . last orbit, we are going to do an engineering experiment that could help . future missions operate more efficiently.' The twin craft focused . exclusively on measuring the moon's lumpy gravity field in a bid to . learn more about its interior and early history. 'After flying in formation for months, they produced the most detailed gravity maps of any body in the solar system. Since the dawn of the Space Age, more . than 100 missions have involved the moon, including Nasa's six Apollo . landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface. The last time the US space agency . intentionally fired a man-made object at the moon was in 2009, but it . was for the sake of science. Spectators on Earth barely saw the faintest . of flashes, but the experiment proved that the moon contained water. 'Grail has produced the . highest-resolution, highest-quality gravity field for any planet in the . solar system, including Earth,' Zuber reportedly said. The . resulting map has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust, Zuber . added, suggesting that the moon, Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus were . pounded by long-ago impacts far more violently than previously thought. Mission . managers on Friday turned off Ebb and Flow's science instruments and . ordered a maneuver putting them  on course for the rim of the crater, . which reportedly sits at a latitude of 75.62 degrees north and a . longitude of 26.63 degrees east. New moon: This locations on the moon that NASA considers 'lunar heritage sites' and the path GRAIL will take to avoid hitting any of them . Impact: These 3D renderings show the lunar mountain targeted by the GRAIL mission for controlled impact of the Ebb and Flow spacecraft . More than 100 missions have been flung to Earth's nearest neighbor since the dawn of the Space Age including NASA's six Apollo moon landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface. The demise of Ebb and Flow comes on the same month as the 40th launch anniversary of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to the moon. Ebb and Flow focused exclusively on measuring the moon's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history. After flying in formation for months, they produced the most detailed gravity maps of anybody in the solar system. Secrets long held by the moon are spilling out. Ebb and Flow discovered that the lunar crust is much thinner than scientists had imagined. And it was severely battered by asteroids and comets in the early years of the solar system - more than previously realized. Data so far also appeared to quash the theory that Earth once had two moons that collided and melded into the one we see today. Besides a scientific return, the mission allowed students to take their own pictures of craters and other lunar features as part of collaboration with a science education company founded by Ride, who died in July of pancreatic cancer at age 61. bout 3,600 classrooms around the world participated, sending back 114,000 photos.

James McCormick, 57, was jailed for ten years for selling the ‘useless devices’ for ‘enormous profit’ to police forces and armies around the world, including Iraq . As pictures of the fraudster enjoying his ill-gotten gains emerged, Judge Richard Hone QC condemned McCormick for his ‘greedy’ pursuit of an extravagant lifestyle which included buying grand homes and a luxury yacht.

Despite expectations that he will serve half of his 17-year jail term, Paul Mosley has asked the Court of Appeals to shorten his sentence . Paul Mosley has asked for his 17-year prison sentence for his role in killing Jade, Duwayne,John, Jack, Jesse, and Jayden Philpott, to be reduced. The announcement comes one day after Mairead Philpott's legal team appealed to the Court of Appeal to cut her 17-year jail term. Mairead Philpott, 32 her husband Mick, 56 and their friend Paul Mosley, 46 were all convicted of manslaughter last month. They started a house fire in Derby, which claimed the lives of the six children who were sleeping upstairs. It is believed that Mick Philpott, who was given a life sentence, . is also considering an appeal. Barrister . Clive Stockwell, who spoke for Mosley during the seven-week trial, . today said: 'We have lodged an application with the Court of . Appeal for leave to appeal the length of the sentence.' Mairead Philpott's appeal against her . jail sentence has been criticised by her father Jim Duffy, who said he . was 'disappointed' by the news. He said: 'Appealing like this will just drag . everything back up and cause a lot of upset to the family. 'It will cost . tax payers a lot of money to get it through the appeal court, there will . be a lot of bad feeling and I don't think she will succeed. I'm . disappointed by it. She should just get on with her sentence. 'I don't think it was too long, she should have got as long as Mick for what she did. 'Six little children lost their lives and nothing will change that.' Mrs Philpott's barrister, Shaun Smith QC said: 'The reaction to the sentence is we think it was too long, and so we are going to see whether or not we can persuade the Court of Appeal to reduce the sentence. Mairead Philpott (left) was jailed for 17 years for killing her six children but says her sentence is 'too long' Mairead (pictured with husband Mick) was told that she ignored 'obvious' risks to her children's safety and is said to have been in a 'horrendous relationship' with her husband . 'Mairead was instrumental in killing six children but we feel her role in the killing of the six children was not as substantial as the trial judge has assessed so we will have to wait and see what the Court of Appeal says.' Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, died from the effects of smoke inhalation following the blaze on May 11 last year. Their parents, along with Mosley, all denied starting the fire, which the prosecution said was 'a plan that went tragically wrong' - aimed at framing Philpott's former live-in mistress Lisa Willis. But following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court, a jury found the trio guilty of six counts of manslaughter. Mairead Philpott's father (pictured left with daughter Bernadette, and right, outside court) said he is disappointed in his daughter's appeal . The cramped three-bedroom semi-detached home in Derby was shared by Mick Philpott, his wife, mistress and all 11 children he had with both women . The six children perished when the fire tore through their home (above) in Derby, last May . A spokeswoman for Derbyshire police said the force would not comment. 'Any appeal against the sentence is a matter for the courts. It would be inappropriate for the police to comment on the reports,' she said.

"School authorities had 'no knowledge of trip' or of its planning' they said . By . Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED: . 07:33 EST, 14 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:45 EST, 15 April 2013 . The BBC risked the lives of students by using them as a ‘human shield’ for a controversial Panorama journalist and his film crew, it was claimed yesterday. The undercover team travelled with ten students from the London School of Economics to North Korea last month. Had the journalists been discovered, the whole group would have faced arrest, interrogation and possible detention. Parents and university officials claim the students – the youngest of whom was only 18 – were ‘deliberately misled’ by the BBC and have called on the broadcaster to apologise and drop the Panorama documentary, due to be aired tonight. Scroll down for video . Panorama reporter John Sweeney with a North Korean colonel overlooking the De-Militarised Zone. Three Panorama journalists are said to have put lives in danger as they secretly filmed inside the highly authoritarian country . The students were invited on the trip via an LSE club, only to learn much later it had been organised by Panorama as a cover for its investigation. Journalist John Sweeney insisted the students had all agreed to enter the rogue Communist state with him, but admitted he withheld some details of the trip on the advice of BBC risk assessors. The LSE said its students were not given enough information to give their consent and accused the BBC of taking unacceptable risks at a time when sabre-rattling by North Korea had already raised tensions with the West. Alex Peters-Day, general secretary of LSE Students’ Union said students and the university had been ‘manipulated’. ‘I think the trip was organised by the BBC as a ruse to get into North Korea and that’s disgraceful,’ she said. ‘They have used students essentially as a human shield in this situation.’ Three of the students have complained, the university says. One said they were not told about key details of the subterfuge until en route for Pyongyang. Students have since received ‘threatening’ letters from North Korean authorities and one parent has complained in writing to new BBC director-general Lord Hall that their child was put in danger. The parent wrote: ‘The methods adopted potentially endangered a number of students who believed they were participating in an organised student tour. I am outraged that in this case the BBC, without obtaining “informed consent”... deceived, used and endangered these students to obtain a story from North Korea.’ The row could prove embarrassing for Lord Hall, appointed after his predecessor George Entwistle quit in the wake of  the Jimmy Savile scandal and the botched Newsnight report which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly identified as a paedophile. A producer for Panorama resigned earlier this month over claims the programme tried to bribe a security consultant to reveal information about a property developer. The LSE said it was not given any warning about the BBC’s plans until last week, after the group returned. It said the deception had put the students in danger and had jeopardised the safety of its academics working in other high-risk countries. The students volunteered for the trip through the Grimshaw Club, a student society linked to the LSE’s department of international relations. Sweeney’s wife Tomiko Newson, an LSE graduate, had organised a group tour of North Korea with the club in 2012 and students were told she was organising this year’s trip. In a letter sent to all members of the university, its management said it was not known to the rest of the party that they were three journalists working for or with the BBC in advance of the trip . Totalitarian: Kim Jong-un is the dictator of the oppressive and murderous regime . They were told in London that a journalist would join them. But they were not told of Miss Newson’s links to Panorama or Sweeney until they reached Beijing. There, as they waited to board the flight to Pyongyang, they were told that a Panorama film crew, including the high-profile investigative journalist, would be travelling with them for the eight-day trip. Journalists are banned from entering North Korea without visas and government minders, so Sweeney posed as a history professor. The reporter – who was once filmed ranting at a Scientology leader during a documentary – likened North Korea to a ‘Nazi state’ and called the experience more frightening than travelling inside Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. He said: ‘It’s extraordinarily scary, dark and evil.’ Sweeney said the BBC’s ‘high risk team’ had wanted the students to be kept in the dark so they couldnot be accused of being complicit in the subterfuge if it was discovered by the North Koreans. ‘If we got into North Korea and I got busted and I’m a journalist, then we were worried, properly and rightly, for the students. So we did not want to tell them everything that we were doing because it would increase the risk for them,’ he said. Sweeney said he believed the majority of the students supported the Panorama film and praised them as ‘brave and good people’. But the parent who wrote to Lord Hall, who asked not to be identified, said their child had not been told of any journalistic involvement until after they had paid £1,969 for their place on the trip. The BBC admits the group was not told about Panorama’s involvement until they were in Beijing. One said they were told the delay was ‘for your own safety’. LSE deputy director Professor George Gaskell said: ‘We were told the BBC had undertaken a risk assessment and it had been approved at the highest level. ‘The LSE believes that any reasonable assessor of risk – or indeed any parent contemplating their son or daughter going on such a trip with the involvement of the BBC – would have thought the risks quite unacceptable.’ Gaining false admission to North Korea is punishable by imprisonment and heavy fines. BBC head of programmes Ceri Thomas said the deception was justified and refused to drop  the film, defending it as an ‘important piece of public interest  journalism’. ‘The only people we deceived in the making of this  film were the North Korean  government,’ he added. A BBC spokesman said Mr Sweeney’s wife had organised the trip before Panorama became involved.","Three Panorama journalists said to have put lives in danger by secret filming .

The lawyer who led the questioning at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards was yesterday appointed a High Court judge. Robert Jay, QC, quizzed high-profile witnesses including David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch, Hugh Grant and the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler during nine months of public hearings. His prominent role as lead counsel to the televised inquiry won him plaudits in legal circles, including barrister of the year at The Lawyer awards in 2012. Robert Jay, QC, quizzed high-profile witnesses including David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch, Hugh Grant and the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler during nine months of public hearings . Mr Jay, 53, will sit as a judge in the Queen’s Bench Division at the High Court, which deals with civil actions for personal injuries, debt, breach of contract and other claims. The division also rules on libel claims against newspapers and other media. As counsel to the Leveson Inquiry Mr Jay’s role was to question witnesses but to remain independent and impartial, and legal sources said it would not bar him from ruling on media cases in the future. He will not be called to sit on the phone hacking claims currently before the High Court, as they have already been assigned to other judges. He will join the High Court next month with an annual salary of £174,481, which is likely to amount to a pay cut compared to his earnings at the Leveson Inquiry. The inquiry cost more than £5.4million in total, of which £1.4million was used to meet the costs of the four counsel to the inquiry. As lead counsel, Mr Jay would have taken the largest share. He was left facing questions after it emerged that one of his junior counsel, Carine Patry Hoskins, had begun an affair with another key lawyer at the inquiry, celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne. Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, and Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, admit going on holiday together to the Greek island of Santorini in August – days after the inquiry’s public hearings ended – but claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November. The couple did not tell Lord Justice Leveson or Mr Jay about their affair and Mr Jay said he first learnt of a ‘personal relationship of any sort’ between them in March this year, and later informed the judge. He was left facing questions after it emerged that one of his junior counsel, Carine Patry Hoskins, had begun an affair with another key lawyer at the inquiry, celebrities' barrister David Sherborne . Lord Justice Leveson has dismissed criticism that the integrity of his inquiry was undermined by revelations of the affair. He insisted there was ‘simply no room’ for a ‘breach of confidence or other conspiracy’ as a result of the relationship. Before the Leveson Inquiry, Mr Jay’s best known case was against oil-trading firm Trafigura in 2007.The company agreed to pay £30million compensation to 31,000 people in Ivory Coast who claimed they had fallen ill after toxic waste was dumped. Mr Jay has also acted for the British Government over alleged crimes in the Kenyan Mau Mau uprising, and has defended the Ministry of Defence against allegations that it failed to help soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

The nephew of an Illinois mayor is suspected of shooting dead a grandmother, a young couple and the couple's two sons at their home in the tiny community of Manchester. Manchester Mayor Ronald Drake revealed this afternoon that the suspected gunman in the horrific slaying was his nephew, 43-year-old Rick Smith. Smith was later killed in a shootout with police, authorities said. The family of five were found lifeless in their Manchester home on Wednesday morning, and were later identified as Joanne Sinclair, 65, her granddaughter Brittney Luark, 22, the girl's boyfriend James Roy Ralston, and the couple's sons Nolan Ralston, 5, and Brantley Ralston, 1. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: Brittney Luark, 22, with sons Brantley and Nolan, was shot in Manchestor, Ill. home with her family . Tragic: One-year-old Brantley Ralston was shot dead on Wednesday. His parents, 5-year-old brother and great-grandmother were also killed . Another child, Cassidy Raston, 7, was in . serious condition, Sinclair's son-in-law Brad Teeter told the Chicago . Tribune. State Police Lt. Col. Todd Kilby said the suspected gunman took . the girl out of the Manchester residence and handed her to a neighbor. Police said the man entered the home . through a back door. They say two victims were found in one bedroom, two . in another bedroom and an adult male in a hallway. Suspect: Manchester Mayor Ronald Drake revealed this afternoon that the suspected gunman was his nephew, 43-year-old Rick Smith, pictured. He was later killed in a shootout with police . It's unclear what the gunman's motive was. Police believe Smith and the victims were acquainted but they didn't provide details of the relationships. The small village, that has a . population of just 350, is in shock over the senseless tragedy. A bystander called police and told them that Smith fled the home in a white sedan. A car chase ensued, leading authorities to the nearby town of Winchester. The . suspect was ultimately captured after a dramatic shootout with the . police. Officers shot Smith, and he later died at a hospital. Police said they found a rifle, shotgun and large hunting knife in Smith's car. Mayor Drake identified the gunman as his nephew just before 5 p.m today. He said he hadn't spoken to Smith in two years, but he believed his nephew was unemployed. Drake said the last time Smith contacted him was to borrow tools. Scott County State's Attorney Michael Hill said Smith, of rural Morgan County, had previous convictions for reckless homicide, drugs and bad checks. The family lived in a first-floor apartment of a housing development, according to state police spokeswoman Monique Bond. 'The guy broke into the house,' Mr Teeter told the local paper. 'I . couldn't tell you about the guy, never met him, never seen him, never . talked to him. Apparently broke into the home of my wife's mother and . shot everybody inside.' Deadly: Police officials investigate the scene at a house in Manchester, Ill., where the five victims were found dead . Tragic: A tragedy unfolded in the tiny Illinois town on Manchester, when five people were found shot dead early on Wednesday . 'I'm at a loss right now,' he said. The seven-year-old girl was taken to a Springfield, Illinois hospital with a gunshot wound. She is listed in stable condition. Schools in . Manchester, which is located 50 miles west from Springfield, Ill. and . about 90 miles north of St. Louis, Mo., were closed after officials from . the local sheriff warned school administrators that the suspect was . still on the loose early Wednesday morning. Les Stevens of the North Greene School District says he was told that the victims had been shot to death. The district has since been informed that the suspect was captured. The tiny community of Manchester registered a population of just 354, according to the 2000 census. The village has a total area of 1.06 square miles. 'It's a tragedy,' Mayor Drake said earlier to the Tribune. 'I've lived here for 43 years and my wife's lived her for all of her life and there's never been a homicide.' Manchester . resident Julie Hardwick, 48, said she lives in the same county housing . authority complex as the victims. Authorities told her she couldn't . return to her home yet because of the investigation, she said. Senseless: Five-year-old Nolan Ralston was also killed in the tragedy . Family: Brittney's boyfriend James Roy Ralston, with Nolan Ralston, was killed in the shooting . Innocence: Relatives are in shock over the tragic shooting that left little Brantley Ralston, 1, dead. Four of his relatives were also killed . 'The kids were really nice,' Hardwick said of the family. 'You couldn't ask for better kids.' The Rev. Robin Lyons of Manchester United Methodist Church, one of two churches in the community said, 'this shows tragedy can happen anywhere.' Two area school superintendents said they received calls from county sheriffs before 6 a.m. informing them that five people had been shot to death at a house in Manchester and that a suspect was at large. Superintendent David Roberts of the Winchester School District and Les Stevens of the North Greene Unit District No. 3 both said they immediately canceled classes when they were told of the shootings and that other school districts did the same. Roberts said the wounded girl is a student at Winchester Grade School and her teacher was with her at the Springfield hospital. The school will use its own counselor, nurse and other staff members to help students who need to talk, Roberts said. Other area districts have offered to help too. Roberts said he also will call on area ministers to be available on campus. 'I've found that to be helpful in the past,' he said.","Joanne Sinclair, 65, her granddaughter .

Lord Sugar last night launched a scathing attack on Apprentice winner Stella English after she lost a constructive dismissal claim against him, saying ‘she picked the wrong person’. The multi-millionaire heralded the tribunal’s decision as a victory against Britain’s compensation culture, and vowed to begin a personal crusade against ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’. Lord Sugar branded Miss English, 34, a ‘money-grabber’ and a ‘chancer’, claiming she had launched a sham case against him in the hope he would pay out to avoid an embarrassing confrontation in court. Scroll down for video . Claim lost: Former Apprentice winner Stella English, left, has lost her claim against Lord Sugar, right, the Judicial Office revealed today . Tweets: Lord Sugar described the verdict as 'a victory for the law against the claim culture' on Twitter this morning . He warned that disgruntled employees . had been allowed to use the tribunal system to effectively blackmail . small businesses into settling claims. He added: ‘This case was a sham and a . total abuse of a tribunal system which is there to protect employees . who have been mistreated. It is not there to aid those chancing their . arm at landing a big payday. ‘I hope that other companies will learn  from this example and also fight off derisory claims.’ Winner: Stella English (front, centre) with the other female Apprentice contestants in 2010 - the year she won the BBC show . Victory: Stella beat rival Chris Bates in the 2010 final of the show but she said the job was not what she hoped . Lord Sugar, 66, said the allegations . against him were ‘tantamount to blackmail’, adding:  ‘I’m afraid she . underestimated me and her reputation is now in tatters.’ Stella English was known on The Apprentice as the 'ice maiden' due to her cool demeanour, but wept when she found out she had won a £100,000 contract with Lord Sugar. The mother-of-two had given up her job in banking after progressing in the sixth series of the BBC show but stressed that all the hard work had been worth it when she beat 15 others to win the talent search. She was tearful as she thanked Lord Sugar for offering her a job, having been described by the peer as 'well-liked and determined to get on with whatever you're asked to do'. The 34-year-old, who left school with no qualifications, said on the BBC after winning that the challenge had been 'convincing other people'. In the interview, conducted in the back of a chauffeur-driven car, she said: 'I'm so excited about the future. It's all been worth it. All the blood, sweat and tears. I've got through to the end and I'm just so happy.' Months later, the cracks were starting to appear however when she started work at IT firm Viglen, a position she ended up stepping down from before then joining television set-top box company YouView. Lord Sugar had praised Miss English on the show for showing determination, noting her background and the fact she had fought to educate herself. Miss English was brought up by relatives on a council estate and then worked her way up the career ladder to an £82,500-a-year job in a Japanese investment bank before applying to take part in The Apprentice. The tribunal heard Miss English is currently working in IT, but in interviews she has spoken of plans to launch her own fashion range of business clothing. She lives with her sons and husband in Whitstable, Kent. In a unanimous written judgment, the tribunal panel said: ‘This was a claim which should never have been brought.’ The Apprentice star’s tirade marked . the end of a bitter legal battle between him and Miss English, who won . the hit BBC1 show in 2010. Her prize was a £100,000 job in one . of Lord Sugar’s subsidiary companies, but she walked away from the . year-long contract after just five months, claiming she was used as ‘an . overpaid lackey’. The mother-of-two, who gave up a . £82,500 salary in the City to go on The Apprentice, said her new . colleagues shunned her because she was recruited through the TV show. On her first day at work she claimed . she was told: ‘The cameras have stopped rolling now … Welcome to the . real world, there is no job.’ Miss English said she felt ostracised . while she worked at Viglen, which supplies IT equipment to schools, . universities and hospitals. Far from being mentored by Lord Sugar, she . said she only saw him five times while she worked there. Miss English told the tribunal that . when she asked Lord Sugar for feedback, he replied: ‘The feedback is: . “Nice girl, don’t do a lot”.’ During a confrontation over her role, she claimed Lord Sugar told her: ‘I’ve met my obligations to you. ‘I did it for the BBC and the . integrity of the show and a bit of my own PR and a bit of yours too. But . the fact is that I don’t give a s***.’ Lord Sugar denied her claims and . yesterday the East London employment tribunal dismissed Miss English’s . case, saying there was no evidence to support her allegation that she . was unfairly treated. Contestants in the show were warned Lord Sugar . would not be their line manager and that they would rarely see him, the . three-strong panel ruled. Miss English was given ‘a real job’ but resigned after discovering the reality of working in the tycoon’s empire, it said. Miss English, who lives in Whitstable, Kent, with her husband Ray Dewar, was unavailable for comment. Dewar, now a builder, was a notorious . hardman linked to Clifford Norris, the gangster father of David Norris, . one of the convicted killers of Stephen Lawrence. Apprentice: Lord Sugar with Karren Brady and Nick Hewer. Stella English won the 2010 version of the show . Testing relationship: Ms English had to carry out a four-month probationary period before she was eventually named the winner of the show in December 2010 . Lord Sugar was defiant as he gave evidence in the employment tribunal and was vindicated today when the panel rejected Ms English's claim . He styles himself as Britain's most belligerent boss and is known for his ruthless grilling of contestants on The Apprentice. But when a former winner of the television show decided to sue Lord Sugar, he was the one facing questions for a change. Lord Sugar's no-nonsense style is now familiar to thousands of television viewers thanks to the reality series which started in 2005. It spawned the catchphrases 'You're fired!' and 'You're hired!' - the latter of which he said to 2010 winner Stella English, who is the first of the show's contestants to take Lord Sugar to an employment tribunal. Before the cameras started rolling, Lord Sugar had been a businessman for decades. The East End boy started off selling electrical goods from the back of a van and then founded Amstrad in 1968, which later went into manufacturing. He stepped down as chairman of the firm, which now sells set-top boxes, in 2008. The Labour peer currently has a string of businesses under his belt. They include advertising brand Amscreen, private air travel firm Amsair and property firms Amsprop - the 'Ams' prefix representing his initials Alan Michael Sugar. He stepped down as chairman of YouView, the television catch-up service that employed Ms English after she left Lord Sugar's IT company Viglen, earlier this year. More recently, he has also invested in products dreamed up by winners of The Apprentice, as the format has changed since Miss English won the show. That fact explains why Lord Sugar, a fan of social media, can often be found extolling the virtues of the s-shaped nail file created by series winner Tom Pellereau on Twitter. Outside the world of business, Lord Sugar has been involved in several spats with high-profile figures on Twitter - and most recently took offence at followers who tweeted ""foul-mouth comments"" on his tribute to Baroness Thatcher, describing them as 'despicable scum'. Last year he angered Donald Trump, star of the American version of The Apprentice, when he told him that 'Scottish don't want wind turbines' and 'The Scottish don't want you!'. Trump replied by saying Lord Sugar 'should not be doing The Apprentice', and added: 'Without my show you'd be nothing!' He also engaged in a war of words with X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, after firing off the missive: 'This Tulisa talks nonsense on X factor, what qualifications does she have to judge singing talent. Please advise where I am missing the point."" The N-Dubz singer replied by telling Lord Sugar: 'As someone that came from nothing to something maybe u should have a little more respect for people that have done the same.' In his personal life, Lord Sugar is an ardent Tottenham Hotspur fan, and used to be chairman of the club. He collects Rolls Royce and Bentley cars - one bearing the personalised number plate AMS1.He is married with three children and is reportedly worth £770 million.","Lord Sugar says it as 'a victory for the law against the claim culture' in Tweet .

A woman who woke from a coma to learn she was four months pregnant has told of her joy after giving birth to a 'perfect' baby boy. Doctors discovered car crash victim Gemma Holmes, 26, was four weeks pregnant when she was rushed to hospital after colliding with a parked car while driving a scooter last September. Ms Holmes - who has been confined to a wheelchair since the accident because her pregnancy prevented her from undergoing vital surgery - was given the shock news when she awoke from a coma around three months later. 'My little miracle': Car crash victim Gemma Holmes was confined to a wheelchair after doctors discovered she was pregnant - preventing them from operating on her injuries . Five months on, Ms Holmes, from Dilton Marsh, Wiltshire, has given birth to baby son Ruben. 'I couldn’t stop crying when they first . showed him to me, because he is my little miracle baby,' she said. 'I was just so . happy to see him after everything we’ve been through.' Not only did Ms Holmes have no idea she was expecting when she awoke from the coma, the amnesia she suffered as a result of the crash meant the three years leading up to it were wiped from her memory - including any recollection of baby Ruben's father Luke Dicks. To add to her ordeal, the new mother has been in a wheelchair since the accident because doctors refrained from performing vital surgery to her back upon learning she was pregnant. But now Ruben has arrived doctors have told the 26-year-old she will learn to walk again, with her operation set to take place in six months time. Baby steps: The brave 26-year-old, seen cuddling baby Ruben, will be able to learn to walk again following her surgery in six months time . 'The doctors have said they will operate on my back after Ruben is six months old, because I’m breast feeding and they want to give me time to bond,' Ms Holmes said.'The doctors will have to break my back again and put metal plates in.  I will then have up to two more years in the wheelchair before they think I may be able to walk and run with my baby.' Ms Holmes suffered severe head and neck injuries in the horror smash in September last year and was airlifted to hospital in a coma. She initially woke in October before being placed back into an induced coma until December. Ruben . was born on Thursday at the Royal United Hospital in Bath and is being . looked after by his mother and his grandmother, Julie Brown.Ms . Holmes, who split from Mr Dicks, 31, two weeks before her accident, . said: 'The nurses at the hospital were all absolutely brilliant, which . helped put me at ease.'My . mum has been amazing and helps me out a lot, but I can feed him and I . also changed his nappy for the first time the other day.' Horror smash: Gemma, seen with her mother Julie Brown and baby Ruben, awoke from a coma to learn she was four months pregnant . Her mother added: 'Gemma is so happy and so excited about the baby. It’s amazing he is here after everything that has happened. 'We had some scares during the pregnancy but he is beautiful.' While Ms Holmes says she won't be getting back together with Ruben's father, Mr Dicks has been visiting both mother and baby. 'When I woke up and I was told I was pregnant I remember thinking, “What? how did that happen?” she said'I have been told recently that I said some time before the crash I didn’t want kids before I was 30.'I was just in shock. Ruben’s dad was not around while I was in hospital but now he has said he wants to see him everyday,' she said. 'It is just great for my son. There is no chance we will get back together but I am glad he will be part of Ruben’s life.'Ruben is just gorgeous, he is perfect. He is so good we have to wake him up for feeds.'Ms Holmes' mother Julie, a grandmother-of-six said: 'I was told Gemma was pregnant a week after the accident. It is all a blur that time.'I didn’t tell anyone for a month because they didn’t think she would make it through.'It was such a shock for her when the hospital staff told her she was pregnant – she had lost three years of memory. It has just been very emotional.'","Gemma Holmes, 26, was left in a coma after horror crash in September .

A gang of hackers who attacked computers at the Pentagon and Nato for ‘laughs’ were jailed yesterday for their campaign of havoc. The four British hackers acted as ‘latter-day pirates’, crashing computer systems and stealing confidential data including passwords and credit card details. Southwark Crown Court heard the four were lonely, isolated young men when they turned to the internet. Once inside internet chatrooms, they were seduced by the status afforded to practitioners of so-called ‘hacktivism’. Three of the hackers were teenagers, the . youngest only 16, yet they attained celebrity status on the internet, . where one bragged: ‘We are gods now.’ They boasted about their ability to attack high-profile targets, . including Sony, the FBI and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. Judge Deborah Taylor jailed three of the four conspirators but gave the . youngest a suspended sentence after hearing the A-level student was . about to go to university. She said: ‘You each played your role during a seven-month orchestrated and sophisticated campaign of dissemination of data. ‘You used your technical abilities to cause substantial loss – in some . cases catastrophic, financially and personally – all for your own . personal amusement and to feed your sense of power.’ The four men, who included student Mustafa Al-Bassam and Iraq veteran . Ryan Ackroyd, left a multi-million-pound trail of damage from their . hacking operations. Working from their bedrooms, often in their parents’ homes, they . accessed the confidential details of 26.4million Sony customers and . 74,000 would-be X Factor contestants in the US. They released police . officers’ personal details onto the internet after an attack on Arizona . state police and another raid left the website of Britain’s Serious . Organised Crime Agency disabled for 12 hours. The hackers, who called themselves LulzSec, attacked their targets out . of ‘simple audacity, if not arrogance’, the prosecution said. The group . even asked its Twitter followers to nominate high-profile targets. 'Theirs was an unusual campaign in that it was more about promoting their own criminal behaviour than any form of criminal financial profit' Detective Superintendent Charlie McMurdie . Cyber raids were organised in a wave of attacks nicknamed Titanic Takedown Tuesday, Wipeout Wednesday and F*** FBI Friday. Prosecutor Sandip Patel said the gang had displayed extraordinary . computer skills but added: ‘These defendants acquired destructive tools . to use on the internet. They are at the cutting edge of a contemporary . and emerging species of international offending known as cyber crime.’ The four men – Ryan Cleary, 21, Jake Davis, 20, Ackroyd, 26, and . Al-Bassam – admitted a series of charges relating to the conspiracy. At . the time of the attacks, Cleary was 19, Davis was 18 and Al-Bassam was . 16. The conspirators never met but were members of the online group LulzSec, . which used the motto ‘Laughing at your security since 2011’. Some . attacks involved stealing users’ data but others simply hijacked sites. A . final mission statement left on the internet, written by Davis, said: . ‘For the past 50 days we’ve been disrupting and exposing corporations, . governments, often the general population itself … just because we . could.’ Cleary, of Wickford, Essex, developed a sophisticated network of . up to a million ‘zombie’ computers around the world which he could . control remotely using a cyber code, a so-called ‘botnet’.

Pioneering: Derya Sert, 22, from Anamur in Southern Turkey, was born without a womb . A woman who underwent the world’s first successful womb transplant is pregnant, it was revealed yesterday. The success of Derya Sert’s IVF fertility treatment could give hope to thousands of childless British women. Doctors treating the 22-year-old said early test results were ‘consistent with the expected signs of pregnancy’. Mrs Sert was described as a ‘medical . miracle’ when she became the first woman in the world to have a . successful womb transplant, from a dead donor, in August 2011. Since then other women have also been . given a womb transplant, but Mrs Sert is the first to become pregnant. Doctors in Antalya, Turkey, waited for 18 months before implanting an . embryo into the transplanted womb, to give the pregnancy the greatest . possible chance of survival. However, Mrs Sert still faces a high . risk of miscarriage and other complications in the early stages of . pregnancy. There is also a chance of birth defects linked to the . immune-suppressing drugs used in transplants. Mrs Sert was born without a womb, a . rare condition which affects around one in 5,000 women. But her ovaries . were healthy and she produced eggs, which doctors harvested before the . womb transplant to create embryos fertilised with sperm from her husband . Mustafa. Earlier this month at least one . fertilised embryo was placed into the new womb by specialists at Akdeniz . University Hospital in Antalya. Any baby would be delivered via . Caesarean section after eight months, to reduce the chance of premature . labour. Artificial selection: Mrs Sert had eight embryos . frozen before her treatment. Doctors thawed them before transferring . them into her uterus - which she received in 2011 from a dead donor . Following a birth, doctors would then . carry out further surgery to remove the donor womb, to avoid the risk of . infection or rejection. A successful birth would give hope to . the 15,000 women in Britain who are born without a womb or who have had . hysterectomies. A team of British doctors is hoping to perform the first . womb transplants in this country within two years.","Derya Sert, 22, from Anamur, southern Turkey, was born without a womb .

The thrill-seekers are equipped with specalised military and parachute equipment - including oxygen masks - to complete their high-altitude adventure. Menuka Gurung, 35, from Everest Skydive, said: 'We do two groups every year with maximum of 12-15 members in each group. Each diver does maximum of three jumps. 'It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete the whole jump from taking off to landing,' he said. 'If we break the whole experience down, it will look somewhat like this: 15-25 minutes for flight, 40-60 seconds of free fall and 3-5 minutes for landing. 'The jump takes place over the Everest region of Nepal, specifically the Syangboche and Amadablam region.' Ready to take the leap: A solo jump over the Everest summit costs a staggering £16,500 . Leap of faith: The skydivers jump from the mind-boggling height of 18,000ft above sea level . The price tag alone is enough to get pulses racing, with a solo jump costing £16,500 and tandems a heart-stopping £23,000.

The pilot was forced to divert to the Orkney Islands, where the 17 shaken passengers were met by emergency services. Close call: The cabin pressure dropped dramatically when a faulty rear cargo door opened during the Flybe flight to the Shetland Isles (file photo) A coastguard helicopter was scrambled and put on standby but the pilot managed to land safely at Kirkwall Airport on the Orkney Islands where it landed at 12.30pm yesterday. Inspectors found a faulty rear cargo door and the plane, a Saab 340B, was grounded. Another aircraft was sent from Aberdeen to collect the passengers. Oil worker James Jamieson, who was heading home to Shetland from a North Sea rig, said: 'I'd just got a cup of tea and a biscuit and the plane slowed really drastically. 'It didn't nose-dive, but it slowed an awful lot. You knew you were in the middle of the flight and it shouldn't have been slowing down as quickly as this. 'You immediately knew something was up,' he added. 'The plane was having to decelerate really quickly. 'The next indication was the air host - he ran up the cabin pretty quickly checking everybody's seatbelt. Then you got a bit more worried.' Diversion: The pilot diverted the Flybe plane and made an emergency landing at Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands . He told how passengers tried to remain calm as they waited for information from the flight deck. 'Probably only a minute or two went by,' said Mr Jamieson. 'There was no real information, you were just looking around. 'They came on a few minutes later and said they had lost cabin pressure because a cargo door had opened mid-flight and we were diverting to Kirkwall. 'There were a few anxious-looking faces. But as soon as we got that reassurance from the guys on the flight deck, you knew there was nothing really to worry about,' he said. 'I think the door had only opened a fraction, or not been fully closed - just enough probably to lose pressure.' The flight was being operated by Loganair. A spokesman for the airline said: 'Flight BE 6774, which departed Aberdeen at 11.55am bound for Sumburgh Airport carrying three crew and 17 passengers, was diverted to Kirkwall following the activation of a cabin de-pressurisation warning light. 'There was an issue with the cargo door at the rear of the aircraft. 'Our crew followed the correct procedures and the aircraft landed safely at Kirkwall Airport at 12.30pm, where it was met by emergency services as a precaution. 'A secondary aircraft was flown up from Aberdeen to transport the passengers. 'A full inspection of the aircraft is currently being carried out by our engineering team,' the spokesman said.","Faulty cargo door at rear of plane caused loss of cabin pressure .

Thug: Christopher Towers, 25, outside prison enjoying his freedom at the weekend barely a year after he was jailed for three and a half years . A young mother left paralysed by a drunken thug only discovered her attacker had been let out of prison early when she saw gloating photos on Facebook. Claire Hilton was sickened to find pictures of Christopher Towers having fun after serving only a third of his sentence for breaking her neck. The snaps are thought to have been posted by his girlfriend, who wrote underneath, ‘finally with my boy’. The case made headlines in November 2011 when Towers was granted bail ahead of sentencing which allowed him to spend Christmas with his family. Miss Hilton yelled at him during the hearing: ‘Look what you’ve done. You’ve ruined  my life.’ Towers, 25, was jailed for three and a half years in January last year for punching Miss Hilton, in the face after a row over a spilt drink. Just 15 months after he was put behind bars, he is out on weekend licence, allowing him to spend time with girlfriend Kelly McKone. After Miss Hilton, 30, came across the picture of him earlier this month, she contacted the police who told her he was due to be released imminently and that as part of his preparation he would be spending a weekend on the outside every 28 days. Miss Hilton said: ‘When I saw the picture I felt sick to my stomach. 'I couldn’t believe that no-one from the police or probation had warned me.’ Miss Hilton, from Sunderland, had been on a night out with friends at the Wheatsheaf pub in Boldon when trouble flared over a drink that had been knocked over on Towers’s mother, Lynn Flaherty, 47. The friends offered to buy her another drink but she and her son flew into a rage. They were ordered out of the pub but waited outside until Miss Hilton and her friends left. Victim: Claire Hilton, 30, who was left paralysed after Christopher Towers broke her neck with a single punch in the attack . McKone, 31, who was with Towers, hit Miss Hilton and Flaherty slapped one of her friends. Towers then ran over and punched Miss Hilton. After spending 12 days in a coma, she was told she had broken three bones in her neck and severely damaged her spinal cord. Two years after the attack, Miss . Hilton is still paralysed and said that if it wasn’t for her son Callum, . 13, she would not want to live. Attack: The Wheatsheaf pub in Boldon, Tyne and Wear, where Claire was targeted in June 2011 following a row over a spilt drink . ‘Doctors have told me I will never . walk again,’ she added. ‘I thought Christopher Towers’s sentence was a . joke to begin with, but him being let out this early beggars belief.’ A spokesman for the Ministry of . Justice said a ‘victim contact  scheme’ was in place to inform  victims . of developments in offenders’ sentences. A Prison Service spokesman  said: . ‘Suitable offenders, who  are thoroughly risk-assessed, may  be released . on temporary licence  to assist with their resettlement  into the . community and their  development of a purposeful, law–abiding life.’ Happier times: Claire before she was attacked, left, and Christopher Towers, right, arriving at court when he was jailed in January last year .","Claire Hilton, 30, suffered a broken neck when she was attacked .

Enraged villagers armed themselves with axes and sledgehammers to tear down makeshift drug dens hidden in the woods near their homes. The group uncovered drug paraphernalia as they destroyed four shacks that had been dug into the ground in Essex woodland, and covered over with roofs fashioned from boat sails. Homeowners in Rowhedge plotted the secret raid with police and the council amid fears the woods could become a permanent haven for drug users and local children were being drawn in. Enough: Angry locals armed themselves with sledgehammers to tear down four shacks hidden in Donyland Woods, near Rowhedge in Essex . They discovered homemade bongs and cannabis pipes as they dismantled the covert drug dens in Donyland Woods. Bill Nair, chairman of the Rowhedge Neighbourhood Action Panel, who led the raid, said they were keen to show drug abuse was 'not acceptable' 'This is a clear message that the people of Rowhedge will not tolerate drugs. 'We know this has become a real worry in the village for people and that worry has increased probably over the last year. 'We want to show this is not acceptable in the community.' Zero tolerance: The group say they found drug paraphernalia as they destroyed the dens hidden in Donyland Woods in Essex . Secret raid: The villagers teamed up with PCSOs and councillors to send the message that 'it is not okay to take drugs in these woods' The group used axes, hammers and sledgehammers to destroy four dens, which were hidden about 300 metres off Furneaux Lane and accessible via a narrow dirt track. Inside there were seats made out of tyres as well as a lounge chair, cushions and a makeshift fire place. Mike Lilley, borough councillor for Rowhedge, said worried parents had been lobbying the authority over the hidden drug dens. 'Now the dens have been dismantled and they are of no use to anyone,' he said. Dave Harris, who represents Rowhedge on Essex County Council, said the group had kept their plans quiet. 'We couldn't afford word to get out,' he said. 'It is not okay to take drugs in these woods. This is a place for all the community to go and I think we've sent that message now.'

A pair of 'lawless' schoolboy gang leaders who terrorised elderly people in their neighbourhood have been ordered by a court to 'grow up' or face jail. Ali Iqbal and Haider Farooq - who dubbed themselves 'the Invincibles' - were the leaders of a  gang of youths that ran rampage around Brierfield in Lancashire; smashing windows, vandalising cars, and deliberately intimidating vulnerable people and pensioners. Local residents described how the 16-year-olds turned the area into 'hell on earth', leaving some elderly people too terrified to step outside their front doors. 'Lawless': Ali Iqbal, left, and Haider Farooq, right, both 16, ran rampage around Brierfield, Lancashire . Iqbal and Farooq were named and shamed at Reedley Magistrates' Court today, as they were served with a two-year ASBO and threatened with up to five years in jail unless they start to behave. The pair, who swore at passersby outside the court, had been convicted of attempted theft and criminal damage at earlier hearings. Details of their campaign of intimidation emerged after victims agreed to keep diaries of their ordeals over an eight-month period. The court heard how the pair raided local buses taking hammers that were in place in case of emergencies, stole wheelie bins, and jumped on cars. JP Brian Pickup . A JP told the duo - who police said 'had no respect for anyone or anything' - the order was their 'last chance'. Farooq said at today's hearing: 'No more messing about.' JP Brian Pickup replied: 'You need . to really grow up while you have got the chance before the authorities . take the view that you need to be put somewhere that can impose some . sort of discipline. 'It is not really the right words ""messing about"". 'Taking hammers, breaking windows, damaging cars, you would realise the potential if that happened to you. 'If you parked your car outside and . it got smashed by someone, would you just think ""he is only messing . about""? I think you would take a slightly different view,' Mr Pickup . said,. 'Have you thought about the consequences, causing your mother and family heartache?' the JP went on. 'This is your last chance, maybe down . the line in six to 12 months the order will be adjusted, if not you are . going to suffer. Make sure you go away and are a credit to your . families.' 'Hell on earth': Elderly residents of Brierfield, Lancashire (pictured), were afraid to leave their homes as the pair ran rampage around the neighbourhood . After the case police and neighbours said both teenagers - who had been excluded from mainstream education - had brought 'hell on earth' to the area. They had initially been offered 'acceptable behaviour' contracts to avoid court action - but refused to sign. PC Tony Feather said: 'They think they are invincible and called themselves as much, and they believed it was acceptable to go on a rampage targeting vulnerable and elderly people. It has just escalated, they have no respect for anyone or anything. 'They built up an entourage of youngsters and smashed up buses and house windows and frightened residents. They have been the focal point of a lot of anti-social behaviour and brought terror to their own neighbourhood because they felt comfortable doing it on their own doorstep,' the officer said.Widower Doreen Baxendale, 76, a retired weaver, said: 'Those two boys are utterly lawless and have no respect for the elders. We never behaved like that at their age. 'They fight, shout and swear and jump on cars and other things. It's appalling. 'They have even been banging on my door at 2am in the morning and I've had to call the police. It's frightening because I live by myself and they make everyone feel very uncomfortable in their own community,' Mrs Baxendale added. Thomas Bamford, 48, said: 'I have to carry a safety alarm with me if I go out because I am scared of them. I don't tend to leave the house at night. 'They are well known. They kick my doors and have done a lot of damage around here. They take the wheelie bins and smash stuff, they even smashed my windows with stones. I feel very uneasy when young lads are hanging around.' The order will prevent the boys from associating with four other males in a public place in Pendle for two years. They are also prohibited from a mapped area of Pendle - which also includes their residential area - unless accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over. Local Labour Councillor Nawaz Ahmed said: 'These boys were involved in disgraceful behaviour and we have put up with these problems for too long. 'The lads are going around making a nuisance and the community will not tolerate it. This is the only area in Pendle where crime has increased, everywhere else has decreased. 'I also believe this is the parents' responsibility as well. I hope this will deter them and others too. Residents are fed up, the boys are out every night bringing fear to the area and insulting people. It is not fair. I hope this puts them back on the straight and narrow,' the councillor said.","Ali Iqbal and Haider Farooq, both 16, ordered to 'grow up' by magistrates .

Education officials in Jajarkot district - where around 8,000 students have joined the annual rush to hunt for the fungus in meadows high in the Himalayas - said there was 'no point' in keeping schools open. 'Himalayan Viagra': Nepalese villagers are seen scouring meadows high in the Himalayas for Yarchagumba during last year's harvest . Parents and teachers are also among those flocking to high meadows in search of the fungus, which is produced when Cordyceps fungus spores attack a caterpillar larva under the ground and kill it - prompting a mushroom to sprout out of the caterpillar's head. Demand: The obscure fungus found in meadows high in the Himalayas during the spring can fetch up to $20,000 per kilo . 'In this district alone, about 8,000 students have left school for the expedition,' Prakash Subedi, from the Jajarkot district eduction office, said in a report on ninemsn.com. 'Without the students, there's no point running the school so we close them. Even the teachers go to collect it,' he said. Mr Subedi added that extra classes were held during the autumn at some schools to make up for the time students miss during the spring tmie Yarchagumba harvest. Although parents are urged not to take children with them when they go in pursuit of the rare fungus, schools' pleas tend to fall on deaf ears because children can earn as much as 100,000 rupees - the equivalent of over $1,000 - during the harvest, Mr Subedi said.

Surgeons in Spain successfully performed life-saving surgery on a baby as it was dying in its mother's womb. Gonzalo Pardo Sanchez was suffering from congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (Chaos) - a rare condition which was preventing his lungs from expelling fluid through the trachea and causing his heart to fail. The outcome seemed inevitable, until his mother's doctors stumbled across a potentially life-saving procedure that was yet to prove successful - until now. Joy: Doctors in Spain have confirmed Gonzalo, now 10-months-old and content in his mothers arms, suffered no brain damage as a result of the risky foetal surgery . Gonzalo survived the procedure and . medics in Spain confirmed yesterday that the baby - now 10 months old - . sustained no brain damage as a result of the operation. It makes it the world's first successful operation to remove an obstruction of a larynx from a foetus. Gonzalo's . parents, Maria Jose Sanchez and Francisco Pardo, both 35, told how . doctors had initially advised them to have an abortion when they . discovered their unborn baby was suffering from the rare condition. Healthy: Surgeons operated on Gonzalo Pardo Sanchez while he was still in his mother's womb . The build up of fluid inside the foetus' body was compressing his heart and causing it to fail. But then their doctor in Almeria heard about a team at a Barcelona research hospital that had performed three operations in a bid to save unborn babies diagnosed with Chaos. All three procedures had proved unsuccessful, but nonetheless it was a glimmer of light for Gonzalo's devastated parents. 'We came to Barcelona without any hope,' Mr Pardo told the Times. 'They gave us an option and a chance.' After finding out about the technique the . couple, from Cartagena, endured a 'difficult' and 'emotional' seven day . wait before Ms Sanchez went into surgery at the Fetal Medicine Centre . Clinic Barcelona. The team . first manoeuvred the foetus into position inside the uterus - the most . difficult part of the procedure - before three surgeons spent 22 minutes . removing the membrane blocking Gonzalo's larynx. Eduard . Gratacos, head of the unit in Barcelona, explained surgeons were able . to perforate the membrane 'quite easily', adding that getting access to . the mother's uterus and in turn the baby's trachea was the part loaded . with risk. 'One move a millimetre to the wrong side of the larynx could have caused serious problems,' he said. In total the operation has been performed on four other occasions globally, but in each of those cases the babies either died or suffered brain damage or serious respiratory problems, the Times report said. After receiving Gonzalo's clean bill of health, his emotional parents have said they are looking forward to enjoying life with their 'fit and healthy' son.","Unborn baby was suffering congenital high airway obstruction syndrome .

Harassment: Michael Anderson, seen left outside court  yesterday, posted holiday pictures of his estranged wife Michelle, right, in a bikini on an adult website . Anderson posted a link to the adult webpage on Facebook after adding the holiday photographs. 'Devastated' Mrs Anderson, 42, called the police when friends called her to tell her what he had done, and her estranged husband was arrested. Anderson was given a three-month community order at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday, and made the subject of an indefinite restraining order banning him from making contact with his ex. Mrs Anderson said in an interview after the hearing that the former couple, who have two sons, split in October when she learned he had cheated on her with one of her close friends. But Anderson embarked on a campaign of harassment after she left him, Mrs Anderson said. 'He did not take the news well, bombarding me with texts and phone calls and even threatening to kill himself,' she said. 'In January he put the pictures on the Hot Mums and MILFs website and then posted a link to the page on Facebook. 'My friends started texting me and calling me to let me know what he had done. 'I wasn't friends with Michael on Facebook anymore, but my mates sent me the link. 'I was devastated when I saw the pictures and what he had written, it was horrific. 'I was so embarrassed,' said Mrs Anderson, who added that her ex had written that she would 'do anything for £40'. 'There were photos taken of me on holiday and I was wearing a bikini.' Mrs Anderson said the pictures were taken down after she called the police. 'They were online for about three hours altogether, but it was long enough,' said the mother-of-two, who said she wants to 'put him behind me and concentrate on my two children'. At yesterday's court hearing Paul Doney, prosecuting, told the court that the harassment all took place between the beginning of January and early February this year. 'The victim said he had been very controlling,' he said. 'Unpleasant': Anderson is seen with estranged wife Michelle in a photograph taken on a family holiday . 'On January 4 she was in the Chichester Arms in South Shields with one of their sons, who was playing in a poker tournament. 'At one point he went up to their son and said he was going to knock her head off. 'Later that day he turned up at her house and started shouting before trying to open the kitchen window.' Anderson was warned by the police to keep away from his former wife, but later in January he turned up at the house demanding a computer from her that he claimed was his. Mr Doney added: 'She then found out that he had posted holiday photographs of her in a bikini on this site, saying she would do anything for £40 and could go to the highest bidder.' A statement from Mrs Anderson read out in court said he had been making her life 'hell'. It said: 'I was scared of physical and emotional violence and feel like I am being stalked. 'He is making my life hell and he knows it.' Charlton James Carr, defending, said: 'It all happened in the aftermath of Christmas, a particularly emotional time for families. 'But since this happened there have been no more problems and everyone has got back on with their lives.' Magistrates read a report about Anderson from the probation service before sentencing him. Chairman of the bench Gordon Minto said: 'You appear to have a complete lack of acknowledgement that there was anything untoward about your behaviour. 'We don't see any evidence that you understand what you did was wrong - which makes this particularly unpleasant. 'The only saving grace is that this seems to have stopped.' Anderson was given a three-month community order with an electronically-tagged curfew between 7pm and 7am and made the subject of a restraining order. He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.","Michael Anderson, 49, admitted a charge of harassment without violence .

A futuristic laser gun that claims to permanently remove hair in 12 weeks and costs a hair-raising £375 is set to become the gadget sensation of the year for British women. The gizmo, reportedly a favourite with Kim Kardashian, has this week gone on sale at upmarket stores like Harrods and Harvey Nichols. The Tria Hair Removal Laser claims to be the first DIY machine of its kind and uses light-based laser beams previously only available at salons. Kim Kardashian is a fan of the £375 Tria laser gun, which comes in fuschia and green . Such treatments are currently the most popular aesthetic beauty treatments among women aged 35 and under. Tests on the Tria found it zapped away 70 per cent of body hair in just two treatments while use over the course of 12 weeks, once weekly, permanently removed nearly all strands of hair. And those that escape its rays will come back finer and lighter so they can hardly be seen, said Tria’s CEO Dr Tobin Island. Already popular in America, the gadget has now arrived in Britain. Dr Island added: 'The Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X is the latest innovation in professional-quality, at-home solutions for our consumers. 'It has experienced tremendous success and vast consumer acceptance (in the US). We are extremely excited to bring it to UK consumers.' The handheld, cordless device - which comes in either green or fuchsia - uses a pulse counter and diode laser technology to disable hair follicles. It only works when applied to the right skin tone. The company recommends it for those with ‘light to medium’ skin tones. Those with very light hair are discouraged from using it as the laser light may not be absorbed efficiently, and those with medium to dark brown or black skin should not use it either, as skin could absorb the laser-light too efficiently and cause burns.

Lagging behind: Evian has been having trouble competing with other designer water brands, and it hopes to catch up with its sleek new bottle . Evian is giving itself a facelift to keep up with its sleek, young competitors on store shelves. The water, which is owned by French food and beverage company Danone, is unveiling a new bottle for the first time in 14 years as it looks to reinvigorate its image and win back market share in the premium water category. Instead of the contoured bottle that has long defined the brand, the new look has cleaner lines, reminiscent of the cylinder-like shape of the Smartwater bottle. Evian's makeover comes at a critical time, given the brand's languishing sales performance in an industry where looks play such a big role. Of course, premium waters such as Evian, Fiji and Smartwater are able to command higher prices in large part because of the claims they make about how they're sourced or processed. But the superficial factor is high, too: distinct bottle shapes set them apart and bestow a sense of status. 'People buy these brands to display them,' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry tracker. 'They don't want a bottle that looks like it's a private label product.' Evian, which is sourced from springs in the French Alps, entered the U.S. market in 1978 and for many years was synonymous with premium water. In recent years, however, it has lost market share with the rise of newer players such as Coca-Cola's Smartwater and Fiji, which comes in rectangular bottles and is owned by Roll Global, the maker of Pom Wonderful. Last year, Evian's sales volume rose just 0.4 percent, compared with a 19 per cent increase for Smartwater and a 4 per cent increase for Fiji, according to Beverage Digest. And its market share was just 0.3 per cent of the bottled water category, down from 1.2 per cent a decade earlier. Eric O'Toole, president of Danone Waters North America, noted that Evian's contoured bottle was original when it first arrived in the U.S. but that it became more commonplace over the years as competitors imitated it. More recently, he said the trend has shifted toward cleaner lines. SCROLL FOR VIDEO . Before or after?: The new Evian bottle is pictured at right, but it doesn't look much different from the current design . 'What the other waters did was put pressure on us to contemporize Evian,' O'Toole said. 'We realized that our bottle had become a little bit old and dated.' Evian's push to win over more customers comes as consumption of bottled water has surged over the past decade, with Americans cutting back on soda and other sugary drinks. But the bulk of that growth has come from more affordable waters, such as Nestle's Poland Spring and the smaller store brands that are typically sold in bulk cases at supermarkets. For major companies such as Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc., selling water in those big cases isn't as profitable as selling heavily marketed drinks like soda or sports drinks. Premium waters are different, however, because people are willing to fork over more money for them too. Evian, for example, can cost between 20 per cent and 80 per cent more than other bottled waters depending on the package size, O'Toole said. The advantages of such premium waters are debatable, of course, with each brand's popularity hinging on claims of what makes them unique. Evian's new labels, for example, will include a short explainer on the back that states ""each drop filters through layers of mineral-rich glacial sands"" in the French Alps. Water babies: A popular ad campaign for the company featured babies dancing and roller skating in order to illustrate their 'live young' image . Fiji, meanwhile, claims to be from an underground aquifer 'hundreds of feet below the edges of a rainforest.' And Smartwater boasts of being 'vapor distilled,' meaning that Coca-Cola essentially puts tap water through a process that strips out the chemicals, then 're-mineralizes' it to improve the taste. Beyond the story lines of what makes their waters special, however, Evian's new bottle underscores the importance of appearances. In addition to the cleaner lines, the bottle will bear a label with a simplified logo that's affixed like a sticker, rather than a wraparound label that's held together by glue. But it will still have a blue tint and ridges at the top intended to evoke the French Alps. It debuts in the U.S. next month, starting with the 330 mL and 500 mL bottles, with an online and print ad campaign set for July. Japan and Canada will get the new bottles toward the end of the summer. Timing for Europe, including France, hasn't yet been determined.","Evian's new bottle is reminiscent of the streamlined looks of Smartwater and Fiji - two of Evian's main competitors .

Golf isn't a sport known for players with reputations for physical toughness but no-one can doubt the iron will of Swedish golfer Daniela Holmqvist. The Swedish 24-year-old felt a sharp pain in her ankle as she played at the a pre-qualifier for the ISPS Handa Australian Open at the Royal Canberra Golf Club in Yarralumla, Australia, yesterday. Iron will: Swedish amateur golfer Daniela Holmqvist in action in Morocco (left) and (right) lining up her drive on the 18th tee during the second round of the 2012 Ladies Norwegian Challenge . Dangerous: Holmqvist was bitten by a Black widow spider, which secretes poison that can kill an adult in under an hour . When the Stockholm native looked down she realised she'd been bitten by a deadly Black Widow spider. Holmqvist swatted the arachnid away, but before she knew it she was doubled over in pain, reports Eurosport. A Black Widow is so venomous that its bites can kill an adult in under an hour - children can die within 30 minutes if struck by the creatures, and the caddies were terrified by what might happen. Did the LPGA Tour rookie faint? Scream for an ambulance? Cry hysterically? No. While the panicked locals rushed around, Holmqvist, whose leg was already swelling up, calmly reached into her pocket, pulled out a golf tee and used it to gash open her bite and squeeze the venom out. 'When I told the local caddies in my group what had happened, they got very upset and said it was a Black Widow, and immediately started looking for their phones to call the medics,' Holmqvist told Svensk Golf.

The BBC last night bowed to pressure to launch an inquiry into  presenter Stuart Hall’s reign of child abuse. Former staff said Hall’s sick behaviour was well known at the corporation, but until now the BBC had resisted a new inquiry. Only . on Sunday, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten ruled one out, dismissing . calls from victims and MPs by saying it ‘would probably delay arriving . at the truth’. U-turn: The BBC has announced it will launch a formal inquiry into presenter Stuart Hall, pictured outside Preston Crown Court . He said . the existing Dame Janet Smith review into the Jimmy Savile crisis would . be widened to examine Hall’s two decades of abuse. But within 24 hours the corporation performed a dramatic U-turn by announcing a new ‘freestanding investigation’. A spokesman said: ‘In light of a . potential conflict of interest with Dame Janet Smith there will be a . freestanding investigation covering Stuart Hall’s conduct at the BBC . which will feed into her review. ‘This work will be led by a different individual appointed by the BBC.’ The ‘different individual’ who will . lead the inquiry was not named, leading to speculation the corporation . has yet to find a suitable person willing to take on the task. The potential conflict of interest . has arisen because Dame Janet knows Ray Colley, who worked with Hall at . the BBC in Manchester. Lord Patten told The Andrew Marr Show that a review in to the Jimmy Savile scandal would also include questions over how Stuart Hall was able to abuse his victims . Hall abused children as young as . nine. He invited teenagers desperate for fame to his BBC dressing room . and molested them, and also groped girls in a sick bay on BBC premises. Some of the dressing-room attacks were allegedly videoed by a floor manager known as ‘The Pimp’. Lord . Patten said it was clear there were people who had been willing to . ‘turn a blind eye’ to the ‘thoroughly unpleasant’ behaviour of the It’s A . Knockout presenter. And he said the BBC would be liable to pay compensation to his victims. Hall has pleaded guilty to assaulting . 13 girls between 1967 and 1986. He faces a jail sentence and was . described as an ‘opportunistic predator’ after he appeared at Preston . Crown Court last Thursday. In striking parallels to Savile, BBC managers were afraid to intervene because he was such a successful star. The BBC denies its change of plan is a U turn . Golden boy: Stuart Hall pictured while working as a presenter for the Look North news programme . Hall was awarded an OBE for his services to broadcasting and charity last year . However, unlike with Savile – who died in 2012 – Hall, 83, is still alive and may yet face further sex abuse charges. Police have confirmed they are investigating claims made by more women who have come forward. A BBC source said its inquiry would need to be careful not to interfere with any new police investigations. Jimmy Savile's time at the BBC is being reviewed by Dame Janet Smith . It is understood corporation . executives are in talks with senior officers to avoid a potential clash. The BBC move will be welcomed by victims’ groups. The National Association for People . Abused in Childhood charity has said the BBC ‘gave Hall unfettered . opportunities to carry out his abuse’, and it owed victims answers. A former colleague of Hall’s, Linda . McDougall, said BBC bosses must have known about his behaviour because . he was ‘unable to talk to a woman without touching her’. MP Rob Wilson said: ‘Once again the . BBC Trust and Lord Patten look slow and reluctant to act. Only yesterday . he said no new investigation, today it has changed. ‘I had hoped something would have been learned from the Savile debacle. ‘The important thing now is that we . find out who knew about Stuart Hall and when they knew it. Was his . behaviour reported internally and if so what action was taken? What . exactly went wrong?’ Last night another BBC spokesman . stressed: ‘This is not a U-turn. It is not a separate inquiry. It is . just an extension of the Dame Janet Smith inquiry. ‘I know it sounds like we are dancing . on the head of a pin, but it is a freestanding inquiry that will be fed . into the Dame Janet Smith review.’ Presenter: Stuart Hall, pictured in 1968, has pleaded guilty to assaulting 13 girls between 1967 and 1986 .","Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman, yesterday dismissed calls for an inquiry .

President Ramzan Kadyrov said the British Foreign Office's safety warnings were incorrect and visitors to Chechnya were safer there than they would be in England . Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said his country is safer than England, despite it being a no-go zone for travellers. The rebel-turned-President claimed Chechnya is not only safe to visit, but less risky than Western countries. Tourists are advised to stay away from Chechnya by the Foreign Office because of the risk of terrorist activity and violent crime. Mr Kadyroy appealed to tourists on his Twitter account in response to the Foreign Office's advice to stay away, which was updated last Friday. 'I am stating with entire responsibility that it is safer in Chechnya than in England! Welcome!' he said. The Russian Republic, in the North Causcus, hit the headlines last month as the birthplace of Boston bombers,Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The men behind the fatal bombing put Chechnya - the former site of a bloody separatist insurgency - back on the world's front pages. The Tsarnaevs are believed to have moved to the US from Russian Republic of Dagestan in 2002 and had retained links to Chechnya. Dzhokhar maintained a page on the . Russian social networking site VKontakte, where he was a member of . Chechen groups. Tamerlan is said to have travelled to Russia for several months last . year and the trip reportedly included a brief return to Dagestan. The Foreign Office called on British . nationals to avoid visiting the Russian North Caucasus region, including . Chechnya, Daghestan, Ingushetia, and several areas of Stavropol Krai, . over terrorist threats. Then: Grozny, the capital of Chechnya in 1995 was a hub of violent crime during the Civil War. In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the 'most destroyed city on earth' Now: Skyscrapers and the Heart of Chechnya mosque now dominate Grozny's skyline. Its streets have been rebuilt and money has been put into regeneration, but it is still seen as one of the world's most oppressive and dangerous cities . Argun Gorge is one of Chechnya's rural gems. President Kadyroy would like the world to see the Russian Republc as a peaceful idyll . As head of Chechnya, President Kadyrov has been . credited for bringing peace and stability to the region but has come . under heavy criticism due to alleged corruption and human rights . violations. Moscow has been fighting militants . since the mid 1990s in its North Caucasus region, with the republics of . Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia witnessing sporadic attacks and . militant clashes. The predominantly Muslim region tried to break away from Russia in 1991 by declaring independence when the Soviet Union began to collapse. 250,000 people were forced from their homes because of a war between Chechen separatists and the Russian army. Years of fighting with Russian forces . ensued, eventually driving the rebels underground. Chechen rebels staged . increasingly bloody suicide bombings and hostage-taking raids around . Russia.

A student used as a ‘human shield’ by a Panorama journalist inside North Korea yesterday accused the BBC of exploiting and betraying her. The London School of Economics student said she was put in danger by the broadcaster and claimed she was only told the truth about its undercover film crew after an alcohol-fuelled night out in Beijing. The young woman, who asked not to be identified, said the ten students from the university, the youngest of whom was 18, only learned they were to be used as ‘cover’ for the BBC’s secret filming  hours before they entered North Korea. Scroll down for video . At risk: The student claims Panorama reporter John Sweeney only told the group about his plan to film undercover in North Korea on the night before they flew to Pyongyang . Panorama journalist John Sweeney bought drinks for the group before they were told of his plans to film a secret documentary in the Communist state, she said. At least one of the group was still unaware of the plan even as they flew to Pyongyang, she claimed. She denied the BBC’s claims that all the students were warned three times about the potential dangers of entering the dictatorship with an undercover journalist. Pyongyang has threatened reprisals against the students unless the BBC agreed to drop the documentary, which screened last night. The LSE student said: ‘There’s a difference between a briefing about risk assessments and having a beer in a noisy pub. 'On our last night in Beijing, John Sweeney was buying us all beers and he bought wine in the restaurant. The next morning I was told they’d told everyone later that night about the documentary. I feel like I was exploited.’ Exploited: The young woman refutes the BBC¿s claims that all LSE students were warned three times about the potential dangers of travelling with an undercover journalist . In danger: If the Panorama team had been found out by the regime led by Kim Jong-Un it could have had dire consequences for the young students . The LSE has reacted with fury to the BBC’s decision to use their students in the documentary without its knowledge or approval. The student, whose parents have made a formal complaint, said she had believed she was going on a university-organised trip via the Grimshaw Club, a student society linked to the LSE’s department of international relations. The club has denied any part in the BBC deception. Students were told Mr Sweeney’s wife Tomiko, an LSE graduate, was organising the tour, but were not warned of her links to Panorama or Mr Sweeney until they were in Beijing. The student said she met Mrs Sweeney in February, when she was told a journalist would accompany the university group, but was not  warned this carried any extra risks. A meeting was then held 11 days later at the George IV, a busy student pub on the LSE’s campus in Central London.

Boris Johnson yesterday laughed off the BBC interview that branded him ‘a nasty piece of work’, saying his inquisitor ‘did a splendid job’. The London Mayor praised Eddie Mair for the grilling he gave him, and how he focussed on whether Mr Johnson had lied about an extramarital affair. But Mr Johnson’s father took a very different view, denouncing the BBC man for a ‘disgusting piece of journalism’ during Sunday’s interview. Scroll down for video . Sealed with a kiss: Boris Johnson gets a kiss from Jessica Alamai as he received a more welcome reception from traders and shoppers in Dalston today following the BBC interview yesterday . Thumbs-up: The London Mayor (pictured today in a good mood) was left visibly flustered yesterday as the BBC's Mr Mair asked him repeatedly about a number of notorious incidents from his past . 'Splendid job': Mr Johnson (pictured left cycling to work today) has shrugged off what happened during the interview yesterday and praised Mr Mair. He is pictured right visiting Dalston today . Visit: Mr Johnson and Metropolitan Police Service Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe joined members of the Dalston Safer Neighbourhood Team on their local beat to launch the Mayor's Police and Crime Plan today . Stanley Johnson, 72, said his son . had been openly abused on the Andrew Marr Show, the corporation’s . flagship weekend political programme, and claimed the BBC had ‘sunk . about as low as it could’. ‘Eddie Mair’s interview was about the . most disgusting piece of journalism I’ve listened to for a very long . time,’ he told LBC radio in London. ‘If grilling people about their . private lives, accusing them of guilt by association and openly abusing . them is a legitimate interview, then frankly, I don’t know where we are . coming. Anger: Stanley Johnson, pictured with his son Boris Johnson, has described the interview as 'disgusting' ‘I felt great anger at this man. I . have no idea who Eddie Mair is or what he does, but frankly, there is . such a thing as respecting the office, even if you don’t respect the . man. ‘I don’t know where Eddie Mair’s . politics come from, but I suspect he would not have treated the leader . of the Labour Party in that way.’ During the broadcast the Mayor was . pressed over whether he lied to then Tory leader Michael Howard about . allegations of an affair in 2004 – which resulted in his resignation as . shadow arts minister – as well as claims he was sacked from The Times . more than two decades ago for making up a quote. Out and about: Mr Johnson speaks to a member of the public while out on the beat with the Dalston Safer Neighbourhood Team today . 'Within his rights': Mr Johnson today said Mr Mair was 'perfectly within his rights to have a bash at me' Arrival: Mr Johnson (pictured arriving in East London today) today said: 'If a BBC presenter can't attack a nasty Tory politician what's the world coming to?' Boris Johnson had his head in his hands after being grilled on live television by Eddie Mair yesterday . Insisting that he was talking about . ‘integrity’, Mr Mair turned to a 1990 telephone conversation Mr Johnson . had with one of his friends who was demanding the private address of a . News of the World journalist. A recording of the call suggested Mr . Johnson had agreed to supply the details, even though his friend . indicated he wanted to have the reporter beaten up for smearing his . family. Mr Mair then asked: ‘You are a nasty piece of work, aren’t you?’ But Boris Johnson said he had no . problem at the approach taken by the interviewer, who is the regular . presenter of Radio 4’s PM programme. London Mayor Boris Johnson had to defend himself over questions about making up quotes, lying about an affair and giving out an address for a journalist to be beaten up . The Mayor told Eddie Mair, standing in for Andrew Marr, that he would not be watching the documentary made about him by Michael Cockerell . Mr Johnson appeared thrown as Eddie Mair grilled him on his sacking from The Times more than two decades ago for making up a quote . ‘Eddie Mair did a splendid job. There is no doubt that is what the BBC is for – holding us to account. ‘I fully concede it wasn’t my most . blistering performance, but that was basically because I was set to talk . about the Olympics and housing in London and he wanted to talk about . other things, some of them – my private life and so on – of quite some . antiquity, the details of which I wasn’t brilliant on. 'He was perfectly within his rights to have a bash at me – in fact it would have been shocking if he hadn’t. ‘If a BBC presenter can’t attack a nasty Tory politician what’s the world coming to?’ The controversy came as a new documentary was broadcast last night on Mr Johnson’s ambitions to become Prime Minister. On the spot: London Mayor Johnson appeared thrown and confused as Eddie Mair grilled him on a number of subjects, including his sacking from The Times more than two decades ago for making up a quote . Uncomfortable: Boris Johnson was yesterday granted a prominent interview slot on BBC1. Its presenter, Eddie Mair, raised three rackety episodes from the Mayor's life and discerned a pattern of deceit, even of menace . In the BBC film, the Mayor went . further than ever before in admitting that he would like to succeed . David Cameron, who was two years below him at Eton and Oxford . University. ‘Obviously, if the ball came loose . from the back of a scrum – which it won’t – it would be a great, great . thing to have a crack at,’ he said. Asked if the interview had dented the . possibility of his son leading the Conservative Party or being Prime . Minister, Mr Johnson senior replied: ‘Boris is clearly a political . figure in this country. ‘From my point of view, he is not the . only Conservative political figure, but it seems to me perfectly . legitimate that he should, in due course, have a chance to put his hat . in the ring.’ In the documentary, Mr Johnson’s . sister Rachel appeared to taunt Mr Cameron by recalling that her brother . was Captain of the School and elected to Eton’s elite group, known as . Pop. ‘It gives Boris a sense of continuing superiority because he was Captain of the School,’ she said. Edited transcript of yesterday’s TV confrontation: .

BJ: Well, I mean, I mildly sandpapered something somebody said, and yes it’s very embarrassing and I’m very sorry about it. EM: Let me ask you about a barefaced lie. When you were in Michael .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:07 EST, 31 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:07 EST, 31 May 2012 . Dangerous: BNP member Joseph Owens, pictured here at 2003 local elections, is known to have a violent past . Police have been ordered to return private CCTV footage of a firebomb attack to a man with a violent past - despite fears it could help him find and kill the person responsible. Merseyside Police had argued for retaining footage belonging to Joseph 'Joey' Owens, who had gangster connections, to avoid 'indirectly assisting or encouraging' him to carry out a revenge attack for the arson attack on his mother's home. But today two High Court judges disagreed with the plea from police, and ruled the force's chief constable did not have power to retain the video from the CCTV system set up by Owens, who had shortly before the fire released a book exposing 'wannabe gangsters' and 'police informants' in Liverpool. Two judges rejected the chief . constable’s appeal against a magistrates’ court ruling that the footage . should be returned under the provisions of the 1897 Police (Property) Act. Sir John Thomas and Mr . Justice King described in a joint written judgment how the mother’s . house in Liverpool was deliberately set on fire in June 2008. She was . alone at the time but escaped without injury. The . video footage was seized as part of subsequent police investigations. It showed a petrol can at the front door and the person believed to have . caused the fire, though the images were unclear. Despite . all efforts, including enhancing the images, the police could not . identity who had set the fire, and the investigation was closed. Owens . applied to Liverpool City magistrates court for the return of the tape . in December 2008 but was opposed by the chief constable on the grounds . that he might inflict violent injury on any person that he identified on . it. Owens, a well-known gangland figure in Liverpool, has several violence-related convictions to his name and has even been charged with murder. In 1982 he served eight months behind bars for sending razor blades in the post to members of Liverpool's Jewish community. He was again jailed in 1994 for carrying CS gas and knuckle dusters while working as a clubland bouncer. In 1998 Owens was charged with the murder of a nightclub security boss, but the charge was eventually dropped when a key prosecution witness withdrew his evidence. Det Sgt Deborah Weir, who was in charge of the arson investigation, told the city court she believed that if Owens saw the tape he would 'seek revenge against the actual offender or a mistaken innocent third party', said the judges. She believed 'that person would be killed or seriously injured'. Owens had earlier identified to the police a possible suspect who had threatened him and asked to see the video as he thought he might be able to recognise the offender from his stance or gait. Merseyside Police had their claim to keep the CCTV footage rejected at London's High Court today . But city court Deputy District Judge Andrew Meachin ruled that, although he understood Det Sgt Weir’s concerns, they did not create special circumstances allowing the police to retain the footage under the provisions of the 1897 Act, which dealt with 'ownership and nothing else'. Upholding the district judge’s decision, the High Court judges said that, as a matter of fundamental constitutional principle 'the powers of the Executive to seize and retain goods' were carefully controlled by the courts. They had to balance the interests of society in finding out wrongdoers and repressing crime against the freedom of the individual. To justify taking an article from a person who had not been arrested or charged, it was necessary for that article to be returned as soon as a case was over or a decision was made not to go on with it. As a result, the chief constable was not entitled to retain the Owens tape under the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The judges said they were prepared to assume that a court could refuse to order the police to return property if it was established that handing it back would indirectly assist or encourage crime. But there were no findings made by the district judge in the Owens case that supported such a conclusion. The judges ruled: 'It cannot be sufficient that the police reasonably suspect that (Owens) might use the tape to commit a criminal act, for that would give the Executive power to retain property without legislative or other authority. 'It can only be if the court itself is satisfied that the use of its process would in fact indirectly assist in or encourage a crime that the court could refuse to allow its processes to be used to that end. 'We therefore conclude that the appeal cannot succeed on the facts stated in the case for the reasons we have given. The video must therefore be returned.'","Merseyside Police to hand film back to violent BNP member Joseph Owens .

The Syrian president Bashar Assad has vowed to 'cleanse' the country of Muslim extremists whom he blames for a suicide blast that killed dozens of people, including a top Sunni preacher who was a staunch supporter of his regime. Today British scientists working for MI6 were . testing soil smuggled out of Syria following reports the Assad regime . used nerve gas in an attack on rebel soldiers. A team at Porton Down, the Ministry of Defence's chemical research centre in Wiltshire is testing the soil for traces of the nerve agent Sarin, the Daily Telegraph reported. Threat: Syrian president Bashar Assad, pictured here greeting people in Damascus on Wednesday, has pledged to 'cleanse' the country of Muslim extremists following a suicide attack on a mosque . Rebels claim forces loyal to . President Bashar Assad used the gas during an attack near Aleppo on . Tuesday. The US and the UN have announced they are also investigating the claims. If Syria is found to have used . chemical weapons it will increase the pressure on the UN to approve . military intervention in the country. In a warning to rebels battling . to topple his regime, the Syrian leader pledged that his troops will . 'wipe out' and clean the country of the 'forces of darkness'.

Aftermath: Syrian citizens search for dead bodies in the rubble of damaged buildings that were attacked by airstrikes, at al-Zarazir neighborhood, in Aleppo . Assad's statement came as the Syrian . Health Ministry raised the death toll from the Thursday night bombing in . Damascus to 49, after seven of the wounded died overnight in hospital. In the attack, a suicide bomber blew . himself up inside a mosque in the heart of the Syrian capital, killing . Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti as he was giving a sermon. The . blast also wounded 84 people. Killed: Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti, an 84-year-old Sunni cleric and longtime supporter of President Bashar Assad was killed in a suicide bombing in the Eman Mosque in Damascus . It was one of the most stunning . assassinations of the two-year civil war and marked a new low in the . conflict: while suicide bombings blamed on Islamic extremists fighting . with the rebels have become common, the latest attack was the first time . a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a mosque. The grandson . of the 84-year-old al-Buti was among those killed in the attack. In . the statement carried by Syria's state SUNA news agency, Assad said . al-Buti represented true Islam in facing 'the forces of darkness and . extremist' ideology. 'Your . blood and your grandson's, as well as that of all the nation's martyrs . will not go in vain because we will continue to follow your thinking to . wipe out their darkness and clear our country of them,"" said Assad. Syria's . crisis started in March 2011 as peaceful protests against Assad's . authoritarian rule. The revolt turned into a civil war as some . opposition supporters took up arms the fight a harsh government . crackdown on dissent. The U.N. says more than 70,000 people have been killed since.  It was not immediately clear when al-Buti's funeral would take place. The government declared Saturday as a . day of mourning and state-run Syrian TV halted its regular programs on . Friday to air readings from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, as well as . speeches of the late cleric. Al-Buti was the most senior religious figure to be killed in Syria's civil war and his slaying was a major blow to Assad. The preacher had been a vocal . supporter of the regime since the early days of Assad's father and . predecessor, the late President Hafez Assad, providing a Sunni cover and . legitimacy to their rule. Sunnis are the majority sect in Syria while . Assad is from the minority Alawite sect - an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

In a speech earlier this month, al-Buti had said it was ""a religious duty to protect the values, the land and the nation"" of Syria. 'There is no difference between the army and the rest of the nation,' he said at the time - a clear endorsement of Assad's forces in their effort to crush the rebels. The mosque bombing was also among the most serious security breaches in Damascus. In July, an attack that targeted a high-level government crisis meeting killed four top regime officials, including Assad's brother-in-law and the defense minister. Last month, a car bomb that struck in the same area, which houses the headquarters of Syria's ruling Baath party, killed at least 53 people and wounded more than 200.","Scientists at Porton Down are testing the soil for traces of Sarin gas .

After years of  iPhone and iPod owners getting turned away for replacements because their devices indicated water damage, and thus a voided warranty, Apple has agreed to pay out $53 million in a class action suit. Settled: Apple has agreed to pay $53 million in class action suit that said it unfairly denied customers replacement devices . The settlement could affect hundreds of thousands of customers who brought their malfunctioning devices to Apple, only to be told they were no longer covered by warranties because a little sticker inside had turned a shade of pink or red. No matter the problem, the company refused to replace any device with a pink or red sticker and must now pay what amounts to about $200 per claimant in the suit. Only owners of original, 3G, and 3GS iPhones as well as first, second, and third generations of the iPod Touch are affected by the settlement. So, who’s to blame? Not us, says Apple. Signed Wednesday, the tech giant admitted to no wrongdoing in the settlement. The company that makes the ‘Liquid Indicator Strips,’ meanwhile, said their product may have been the culprit in so many voided warranties. Though Apple owns the patent to the strips, maker 3M indicated that humidity and not water contact could have turned some of the white stickers pink, misleading customer service representatives who examined the devices. Apple, nonetheless, may have learned of the issue years ago. Denied: For years, Apple routinely voided warranties to customers whose devices indicated water damage . According to a report in The Atlantic, the company ‘quietly tweaked’ its water damage policy in 2011 to be a little more giving. The policy now indicates that devices with an activated LCI may still be replaced ‘if a customer disputes’ that water made contact with the device as long as there are no signs of corrosion. However, the policy stopped short of faulting the indicator strips, which the policy says ‘are designed not to be activated by temperature or humidity that are within the product's operating requirements.’ That means newer devices were not covered in the suit, payouts for which could go up or down depending on number of claims submitted. Blame: Apple claimed no wrongdoing in the suit while makers of the 'Liquid Contact Indicator' strips admitted they may have been misleading .","Hundreds of thousands could get $200 settlement after owners under warranty were denied servicing from the tech giant due to faulty 'liquid contact indicators'

A search team led by a British aviation enthusiast arrived in Burma yesterday to begin a dig he believes will unearth dozens of rare British Spitfire fighter planes.British farmer David Cundall, who heads the team, spent over a decade and more than £130,000 of his own money working to track down the aircraft, after being told by a group of U.S. veterans they were buried there at the end of the Second World War.The 62-year-old and a group of archaeologists hope to find the planes so they can be painstakingly packaged up and transported back to the UK for restoration. Finally there: Farmer David Cundall pictured finally arriving at Yangon International Airport yesterday to begin the excavation of spitfires buried in Burma at the end of WWII . The team: The British archaeologists, pictured yesterday at Yangon Airport, will start digging in the next few days and hope to find anything between 36 and 60 planes . The 21-member team will start excavations near the airport in the country’s largest city, Rangoon, in the next few days. At least 36 - and potentially as many as 60 - of the British fighter planes are believed to have been buried in the Burmese jungle towards the end of the Second World War in 1945. In 1996 aviation enthusiast Mr Cundall, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was told the rare Marx XIV Spitfires were buried there in crates in August 1945. High hopes: Aircraft enthusiast David Cundall, 62, has spent the past 17 years researching and investigating into the case of the missing Spitfires . Saved for posterity: The historic planes were buried in the Burmese jungle in August 1945 . He subsequently spent two years researching the project, eventually gathering eight eye-witness reports backing up the claims. Surveys undertaken at one of three sites . in Burma have indicated the presence of large areas of electrically . conductive material around 10 metres beneath the surface of the ground. The location matches the eight eye-witness reports collected by Mr Cundall, who has made 16 visits to Burma over the years conducting surveys and negotiating with authorities. Hopeful: David Cundall, pictured in front of a spitfire at the Imperial War Museum in London, hopes the planes will still be in 'first-class condition' One of the Spitfires (pictured: the tail fins) being crated up in Burma in 1945 ready to be buried . Avengers re-assemble: The team hopes to be able to uncover the Mark XIV Spitfires in a good enough state so that they can be reassembled upon their return to Britain(file photo) His project reached a landmark . junction last year when sanctions blocking the movement of military . materials in and out of Burma were lifted. Speaking shortly after arriving at . the international airport in Rangoon, Mr Cundall said: 'We are expecting . them to be in first-class condition.' He believes the excavation project will take about four to six weeks to complete. The Spitfire remains Britain’s most . famous combat aircraft. Its reputation was cemented during the Battle of . Britain when the fast-moving single-seater aircraft helped beat back . waves of German bombers. Britain built a total of about 20,000 Spitfires, although the dawn of the jet age at the end of the Second World War meant that the propeller-driven planes quickly became obsolete. Searchers hope they are in pristine condition, but Andy Brockman, a freelance archaeologist who is part of the search team, said it was possible all they might find is a mass of corroded metal and rusty aircraft parts. But he added: 'I’m very confident that we’ll have answers to the story of what happened ... in 1945.' The venture is being backed by the Belarusian videogame company Wargaming.net, which is best known for its multiplayer titles including World of Warplanes and World of Tanks. The search team says 36 Spitfires are believed to be buried near Rangoon airport, while another 18 are in Myitkyina in northern Kachin state and six more are buried in Meikthila in central Myanmar.

"By . Ian Gallagher . UPDATED: . 19:21 EST, 28 January 2012 . The former managing editor of The Sun and three of the newspaper’s most senior journalists have been bailed after they were arrested yesterday over corruption allegations. Along with a 29-year-old detective, they were all questioned about  illegal payments to police officers. Detectives simultaneously searched the headquarters of News International, the paper’s publisher, in East London. Investigation: A detective leaves the home of Mike Sullivan, the Sun crime editor, with paperwork and other potential evidence yesterday . The arrests mark a shift in the focus of the corruption investigation, Operation Elveden, which had centred on The Sun’s now defunct sister paper, the News of the World. The four Sun employees are former managing editor Graham Dudman, 48, now a training director at News International; executive editor Fergus Shanahan, 56, a former deputy editor of the paper under Rebekah Brooks; long-serving crime editor Mike Sullivan, 48; and head of news Chris Pharo, 42. Their arrests came as a result of information given to police by their employers. A source said it was an attempt at ‘draining the swamp’ to restore journalistic integrity at Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers. Age: 56 . Role at The Sun: Deputy Editor from 2003-9 when Rebekah Brooks was editor. Background: The paper's Executive Editor and leader writer, crafting the comment pieces that appear under The Sun's name every day. He was night editor and worked on the 'back bench' in production. Started out on the Reading Evening News. Age: 48 . Role at The Sun: Formerly a managing editor. Background: Works in a training role for News International. He was formerly the head of news and head of features. He was appointed by former editor David Yelland and previously worked as a freelance in Florida, Miami, as well as for The Express. He was a reporter on the Stockport Express (1983-5) and the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette (1985-7). Age: 42 . Role at The Sun: Head of news. Began his career with the South West News agency before becoming the South West  district reporter for the Sun and is a long-time staff member. Age: 48 . Role at The Sun: Began his career at National News agency before graduating to The Sun in his 20s. Sullivan is currently the paper's Crime Editor and has been for a number of years. Shanahan was deputy to Rebekah Brooks, pictured here with her baby girl, named Scarlett Anne Mary Brooks, when she was editor of the Sun . Staff and management at The Sun . received no warning that police were planning to search the offices but . they have long been aware that the internal investigators have been . trawling through thousands of emails looking for evidence of wrongdoing . by employees. News . Corporation, the parent company of News International, said the  company . ‘made a commitment last summer that unacceptable news-gathering . practices by individuals in the past would not be repeated. ‘It . commissioned the management and standards committee to undertake a . review of all News International titles, regardless of cost, and to . proactively co-operate with law enforcement and other authorities if . potentially relevant information arose at those titles.’ Four . of the arrests took place between 6am and 8am and were on suspicion of . corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and . conspiracy in relation to those two offences. The . men were being questioned at police stations in London and Essex. Police are understood to have mistakenly visited Mr Pharo’s former . marital home before phoning him. He later attended  voluntarily at a . police station, where he was arrested. Sir Paul Stephenson, the then Met Commissioner, said in July that evidence from News International suggested a small number of officers were involved . The heir to Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has quit the board of Britain’s biggest drugs company in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch joined  GlaxoSmithKline less than two years ago. He has come under fire from MPs who have questioned him about signing off out-of-court settlements to hacking victims without a full picture of what had gone on at the News of the World. He was forced to deny misleading Parliament over the extent of his knowledge. Glaxo said Mr Murdoch’s decision to turn his back on the £98,000 role was entirely his own. Chairman Chris Gent said: ‘James has taken this decision to focus on his current duties as non-executive chairman of BSkyB and following his decision to re-locate to the United States as chairman and chief executive, international, of News Corporation.’ Mr Murdoch has recently removed himself from the boards of all the UK newspaper companies owned by News International, including the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun. The . detective was arrested at the Central London police station where he . works in the Metropolitan Police’s Territorial Policing Command. He was . detained on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office and . conspiracy in relation to those two offences. The arrests bring to 13 . the total number of arrests under Operation Elveden. A . Scotland Yard spokesman said the operation was about suspected payments . to police officers and was not about ‘seeking journalists to reveal . confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained . legitimately’. In an email . to Sun staff yesterday, News International’s chief executive Tom . Mockridge described the arrests as ‘very difficult news’. He . said the company was ‘confronting past mistakes and is making . fundamental changes about how we operate which are essential for our . business’. Others . questioned as part of Operation Elveden include former News . International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, ex-Downing Street . communications chief Andy Coulson and former News of the World managing . editor Stuart Kuttner. Mrs . Brooks and Mr Coulson are both former editors of the News of the World, . which in a shock move was closed in July last year following revelations . that reporters had hacked the mobile phone of murdered teenager Milly . Dowler. Deborah Glass, . deputy chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is . supervising the investigation, said the arrests yesterday showed that . police were ‘following the evidence’. She . added: ‘I am satisfied with the strenuous efforts being made by this . investigation to identify police officers who may have taken corrupt . payments and I believe the results will speak for themselves.’ Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), has said she is satisfied with the efforts being made to identify police officers who may have taken corrupt payments .

Frank Armstrong, 52, until recently the £130,000-a-year second in charge of City of London Police, is the first chief officer to be arrested as a result of inquiries arising from Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden – which was set up to investigate allegations of bribes paid to police officers and other public officials. Last night the police watchdog, whose investigators arrested  Armstrong on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, stressed that ‘at this stage’, no money is alleged to have changed hands between him and the reporter. His arrest at his home in South-West London at 7am yesterday came just two months after he was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal for distinguished service and followed an illustrious career which included a spell as head of Tony Blair’s Special Branch protection team. His arrest comes just weeks after another respected senior officer, Met Chief Superintendent Andy Rowell, was arrested over alleged disclosures of confidential information to the media. He, too, is not suspected of receiving any payment from the media. Rowell’s arrest coincided with Home Office plans to adopt many recommendations regarding contact between the Press and police set out in the Leveson Report. Such a move would significantly weaken a journalist’s ability to resist police requests for confidential information on sources. So far 108 people, including more than 70 journalists, have been arrested in relation to three linked inquiries launched by Scotland Yard in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. As well as the Operation Weeting inquiry into phone-hacking and Operation Elveden, a third investigation, Operation Tuleta, is looking into computer hacking and other privacy breaches. Armstrong’s most recent job as Assistant Commissioner of City of London Police – equivalent in rank to a deputy chief constable – included responsibility for counter-terrorism and saw him oversee several highly sensitive fraud investigations. Ten years ago, when ‘Commander’ of the same force, he rose to national prominence when he wrote a highly critical report about police failings which allowed an intruder to gatecrash Prince William’s party at Windsor Castle in 2002. His report, which made 28 recommendations for improving the security of the Royal Family, was widely praised for not pulling punches. Speaking in 2003, Armstrong said William’s party had been dealt with as a private event with low-key security, when in fact it should have been treated as a high-profile event. Ten years ago, when 'Commander' of City of London Police, he rose to national prominence when he wrote a critical report about police failings which allowed an intruder to gatecrash Prince William's party at Windsor Castle in 2002 . ‘Certainly this event taking place in a post-11 September world should have warranted the highest level of security,’ he said. A larger-than-life character, with a keen interest in rugby and raising money for charity, Armstrong was popular with junior officers before he left City of London Police last September to work in corporate protection. Last night Padraig Reidy, of the campaign group Index on Censorship, said the latest arrest was ‘troubling’. He added: ‘In the post-Leveson environment, it seems that more and more, informal contact between police officers and the Press is being outlawed. Such informal contact can have its own issues, but it is also crucially important for investigative reporting and scrutiny of the police and other authorities.’ The Independent Police Complaints Commission said its investigators had arrested a 52-year-old  on ‘suspicion of misconduct in public office in relation to the alleged passing of unauthorised information to a journalist’.

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 20:05 EST, 13 September 2011 . Benefits claimants who cannot speak and write English will be ordered to take language classes or have their handouts stopped for up to three years. The measure, announced by the Prime Minister and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, is expected to apply to about 67,000 people on Jobseeker’s Allowance.  It is designed to target a hardcore of claimants whose language skills are so poor they have little or no chance of ever being offered a job and are doing nothing to improve their skills themselves. But despite David Cameron’s stance, cynics are likely to suggest the measures will join a raft of tough-talking announcements that lose their teeth in practice. Tough talk: Mr Cameron with Shahida Din of A4E, a company that helps the unemployed find work. The Prime Minister made his remarks during a tour of the Brixton firm today . Under the plans, anyone who refuses . to start an English course or fails to turn up to classes will face a . sliding scale of sanctions. Most of the group of 67,000 claimants . are immigrants with a right to work in this country, but a significant . number are British-born people whose education has been so dire they are . barely able to communicate. However, Government officials themselves admit they expect the sanctions to be little used. Many claimants, they say, are often . keen to take up the offer of free  language classes, while even those . who are not are expected to be motivated by the threat of having their . benefits stopped. Speaking on a visit to Brixton, South . London, Mr Cameron said: ‘We are getting rid of the old idea that you . can get your welfare without conditions being put on that. ‘We’re saying that if there’s . something you need to help you get a job, for instance being able to . speak  English and learn English properly, it should be a requirement . that you do that study in order for you to receive your benefits. Clear message: Under the new rules, Jobcentre Plus staff will be able to direct claimants to language classes (File photo) ‘That’s good for you because it’s . going to help you get a job, it’s good for the taxpayer because we won’t . be wasting money on welfare that’s unnecessary, and it’s good for the . economy because we want more people in work creating a bigger, more . productive economy.’ Jobcentre Plus advisers will be able . to mandate people to take part in training courses if they judge they . lack the correct skills to get the jobs on offer in the local labour . market. People with poor English skills, . which are preventing them from getting into employment, will be referred . to English language training courses run by local colleges and funded . by the Department for Business. If claimants refuse or fail to attend . any of the classes recommended to them, they will have their . Jobseeker’s Allowance stopped for three months. A second offence will mean benefits being withdrawn for six months and a third three years. The measure extends ‘conditionality’ in the welfare system, meaning conditions are attached to receiving handouts. In a similar example of this, Mr . Cameron has asked the Government’s social policy review, announced in . the wake of last month’s riots, to look into whether the parents of . children who constantly play truant  should have their benefits cut. Speaking as the Welfare Reform Bill . was debated in the House of Lords, Mr Duncan Smith also announced that . benefit claimants will receive their money in monthly payments under the . Coalition’s new Universal Credit system, which will replace a host of . out-of-work benefits. Since 75 per cent of people who work . are paid monthly, Mr Duncan Smith said it was only sensible  benefits . are paid in the same manner, to help claimants get used to managing . their money and bills on a  four-week basis to smooth the transition . into work. ‘People get benefits on a fortnightly basis, yet most people in work are paid monthly,’ the Work and Pensions Secretary said. ‘This change can cause anxiety and dissuade people on benefits from entering the workplace.",Tough new measure is part of a slate of reforms to end welfare dependency and get Britain back to work .

Detectives investigating the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann believe a team of British cleaners may hold the key to her whereabouts. Owners of apartments in the Portuguese holiday complex where Maddie and her family were staying when she vanished in 2007 have been asked about cleaners in the area who had a white van. One property owner said police told him they are looking for a group of six to eight British cleaners who drove around the Praia da Luz area in a white van, working in holiday apartments. Madeleine, left, and a computer generated image of how she may look now, six years after she disappeared . It is the first time the cleaning team has been been mentioned since the hunt for missing Maddie, who was three when she went missing on a family holiday to Portgual, began. The new line of inquiry came from British officers reviewing all the evidence as part of Operation Grange. Detectives working to establish who was in the Praia da Luz holiday apartments at the time have asked property owners repeatedly if they had seen a team of British cleaners working there. One apartment owner called police after he received a letter from them saying they were checking who was in the flats at the time. He told The Sun: 'The officer said it had been drawn to their attention there were British people that cleaned the apartments who they needed to speak to. 'They said ""Who are the British cleaners that are cleaning the apartments in a white van?""' 'They were very interested in who'd have access to those apartments.' The owner said police asked him about the cleaners four times, and led him to believe that they were looking for six to eight British men or women. Police believe a team of cleaners who used a van like this may help them in the hunt for missing Madeleine . He said that usually the Ocean Club resort's own cleaners worked in the apartments, but several property owners used cheaper British cleaners, who advertised on cards in the local supermarkets. The new lead is not believed to have come from Portuguese police, but possibly from information gathered during interviews conducted by British police. A white van has been mentioned in connection with Madeleine's disappearance before, but this is the first time a team of British cleaners has come up. Three years ago a Portuguese man told police he'd seen a girl he believed to be the missing three-year-old in the back of a white van near her holiday resort. Resort at the centre of the mystery: The McCanns' apartment is the last ground floor one on the right . He said there were a couple of people whom he believed to be gypsies by the van. A separate report to Portuguese police mentioned a white van and a young, dark-haired man, who was staring at the holiday apartments the McCanns had been staying in. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Officers are reviewing all of the material in relation to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. 'This is routine procedure as part of the ongoing review.' Operation Grange was set up by the Metropolitan Police two years ago at the request of Prime Minister David Cameron following a plea by Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leicestershire. In May it will be six years since Madeleine disappeared from the Portuguese holiday resort.

The quest to find scores of buried Spitfires in Burma was yesterday beginning to descend into farce as doubts grew that any would ever be found. Recrimination and disappointment were in danger of splitting the team of experts searching for as many as 136 of the Second World War fighters. The project had finally started after 17 years of effort by a Spitfire devotee trying to find the aircraft last seen boxed up in large crates in 1946. Excavation: Heavy diggers had been brought in to help with the search for the buried Spitfires at Yangon International Airport in Burma but archaeologists now believe there is no evidence support the claim that the rare aircraft are buried there . But divisions among members of the team emerged after they had been searching near the capital Yangon for two weeks. Yesterday that dig was  suspended and the bizarre treasure hunt will move to a second location 900 miles to the north. According to David Cundall, the man . leading the hunt, fresh scientific equipment is required before digging . can resume at Yangon. However, other members of the operation have now . cast doubt on the prospect of finding anything at all. Last night, the internal divisions . only added to the confusion over the quixotic attempt to unearth the . aircraft. They are believed to lie in three locations across Myanmar . (modern-day Burma) and could be worth up to £1million each. Searching: The dig was being led by Lincolnshire farmer David Cundall (left) and has attracted international media attention . Big dig: JCB excavators and tents line the side of the runway at by the side of the runway at the busy airport . A 21-strong team of archaeologists, . geo-physicists and sponsors has been at the first site near  Yangon’s . international airport for two weeks and intended to announce their . initial findings at a press conference tomorrow. However, that was suddenly cancelled . on Thursday after the team had probed a few feet below the surface and . found live cables and functioning technical equipment connected to the . airport. ‘We had to stop the dig because, while . we have equipment to detect Spitfires at 20ft, we don’t have the . equipment to detect cables at 5ft,’ said Mr Cundall, a farmer from . Lincolnshire. Yesterday, the BBC reported that some . of the archaeologists now doubt the existence of any Spitfires. Since . they have yet to visit two other sites identified by Mr Cundall, this . has created divisions within the operation. ‘The digging went incredibly slowly and I made my opinions known,’ said Mr Cundall. Technology: Mr Cundall (left) looks at ground scans with two of his team of British archeologists. He has spent more than a decade and £130,000 working to track down the aircraft . Hope: The Spitfires are believed to have been buried as a way of disposal when the war came to an end . Blessing: Mr Cundall speaks with a Buddhist monk who was brought to bless the site before digging began . Site: the Burmese Government has given Mr Cundall's team permission to dig for the planes at Yangon (Rangoon) International Airport . Although he is the brains behind the . project, the excavation work and archaeologists are being funded by . wargaming.net, a video games company, ‘The archaeologists weren’t . digging in the area we believe holds the Spitfires,’ Mr Cundall added. ‘Instead, they wanted to see what sort of war remains were buried.’ His frustrations were shared by war veteran Stanley Coombe, 86, a witness to the original burials. Publicity: A journalist takes photos of research materials related to buried British Spitfires which are thought to be buried in the Burmese jungle . Lost: One of the Spitfires (pictured: the tail fins) being crated up in Burma in 1945 ready to be buried . Valued: The team hopes to be able to uncover the Mark XIV Spitfires in a good enough state so that they can be reassembled upon their return to Britain (file photo) Last night, having just returned from . Yangon, he said: ‘They were digging in the wrong place and I told them . so.’ He has very clear memories of seeing large crates being interred on . the site shortly after his 20th birthday in 1946. Mr Coombe was stationed in what was . then Rangoon while serving in the Royal Berkshire Regiment. ‘I asked . this RAF chap what was in these huge crates and he said: “You’ll never . believe it, but they’re Spitfires”. ‘It was cheaper to bury them  than take them home and they didn’t want them falling into the wrong hands.’ Last night, the sponsors were . unavailable for comment. Meanwhile Mr Cundall made plans to continue . digging at the second site at Myitkyina where a submerged crate has . already been discovered. ‘The Myitkyina dig looks promising,’ says Spitfire expert Peter Arnold, who is accompanying Mr Cundall. ‘They . dug a deep hole by hand and at the bottom hit upon the corner of a . wooden crate with a metal strap around it. ‘The crate was full of muddy water and . nothing more was done with it. However, it’s sitting there waiting to . be dug up properly.’ To add further confusion to the . situation, a rival Israeli excavation team has appeared on the scene in . the hope of persuading the Burmese authorities to allow them to dig for . the planes.

Adolf Hiter’s autobiography Mein Kampf - a hate-filled book post-war Germany has fought to keep out of the bookshops - is to make a comeback in schools. German authorities announced today that when the copyright to the hate-filled tome expires in three years’ time, an ‘annotated’ version will be made available to students across the country. The state of Bavaria, which became the heir to all of Hitler’s works, property and money following his 1945 suicide in Berlin, said it was important for Germany to publish versions for children with expert analysis and comments from historians in them which refute his ideology. Mein Kampf: The hate-filled book has not been printed in Germany for 70 years. But Bavaria want to produce an annotated version before it loses ownership of its copyright in three years time . While the book is not illegal in Germany, the state has not allowed it to be printed amid fears that it could promote Nazism. Other countries have printed foreign-language editions since then, despite the restrictions but Germans have been unable to get a newly-printed version in their own language for 67 years. But now Bavaria has now given permission for the rest of Germany to freely print the book, with includes diatribes against Jews and Slavs and the prophecy of a German war of conquest in the east. Mein Kampf, which translates as My Struggle or My Battle, combines elements of autobiography and Adolf Hitler's political ideology. It was written while the Nazi leader was in jail following the failed 1923 Munich Pusch and was published in 1925. It includes racist diatribes against Jews and their ‘twin evil’, communism. He argued that Germany would be forced to fight a war in the east as it secured ‘lebensraum’ – or living room – for its citizens at the expense of Slavs, whom he also viewed as inferior. It explains why aggressively expanded Germany eastward, specifically the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland, before he launched his attack against Russia. As a form of manifesto, he also argued that Germany would be better off without parliamentary government, which he blamed for the country’s problems. 'The editions we plan will contain . comments from experts that are clearly understandable to the young so . they can clearly understand and therefore interpet the dangerous ideas . within,' announced Bavaria’s finance minister Markus Soeder in . Nuremberg. 'We will demystify this work.' Recently Bavaria successfully saw off attempts by a British publisher to produce extracts of Hitler’s book in magazine format. The book was once a bigger seller during the days of the Third Reich than the Bible and royalties from it made Hitler incredibly wealthy. But since Nazism was vanquished successive governments have always been afraid of allowing it to be re-printed because of fears that it would influence new generations of far-right radicals. But with the rise of the Internet and numerous pirated copies of the work published abroad, Bavaria believes it is better to have some control over the work when the state loses its copyright than none at all. In the book Hitler pours scorn on Jews, outlines his plans for the racial conquest of the Soviet Union and promises his followers of an empire that would last 1,000 years. Menacing: Hiter, seen greeting his supporters, set out many of his plans in Mein Kampf, which he had published in 1925 . In fact it endured for just 12. Nevertheless, the book is an integral part of the study of the Third Reich and copies have sold for up to £30,000.","Bavaria, which owns copyright but has not allowed publication, says it's time to print 'annotated' version ."

A massive alligator-like creature the was discovered by police guarding a drug stash inside a home in northern California home has died overnight. Veterinarian Dr Karen Emanuelson said the reptile, which was actually a dwarf caiman, was critically ill and non-responsive when it was brought to Oakland Zoo Wednesday. Doctors said they examined the critter, nicknamed Mr Teeth, tested its blood and determined that its survival chances were very low. Scroll down for video .

Rental: Assif Mayar, 32, lives in this two-story rental house in Castro Valley, California, where he lives with his wife and two small children . Seized: Deputies recovered 34 pounds of processed marijuana, worth an estimated $100,000 or more . Put away: Assif Mayar, shown in this undated mug shot, was arrested after an alligator named Mr Teeth was discovered in his home in Castro Valley, . The caiman, which was 16 years old, . succumbed to its mysterious illness sometimes overnight, NBC News reported. The Oakland Zoo . staff would not say what was the animal's cause of death. A necropsy will be performed to shed light on what killed the critter. Officers performing a routine . probation check on a northern California man Wednesday were shocked to . find that he had some 34lbs of marijuana in his rented house. But they were more startled to discover the animal guarding it – a five-foot caiman named Mr Teeth. The Alameda County Sheriff’s deputies arrested Assif Mayar, 32, and took his illegal pet to the Oakland Zoo. According to KTVU, deputies stopped by Mayar’s two-story rental home in Castro Valley on Wednesday afternoon to perform a probation compliance check. Alameda County Sgt. J.D. Nelson said yesterday in a news conference that while inspecting the house, officers discovered 34 pounds of dried, processed marijuana in Mayar’s bedroom. Next to the pot was a two-by-eight-foot Plexiglas tank containing the alligator. Sgt Nelson said that the massive reptile was likely used as a deterrent for would-be marijuana thieves. The sheriff’s department called in backup from the Fish and Game department, NBC Bay Area reported. The sergeant said that stumbling upon an alligator was highly unusual. ‘We come across guard dogs like pit bulls quite frequently, but a guard alligator is very unusual,’ he said. KTVU notes that the married father-of-two has several dogs, including a pit bull, in his rental house. Mayar purchased Mr Teeth in 1996 to ‘commemorate the death of rapper Tupac Shakur,’ Sgt Nelson said. Care: Mr Teeth was taken to the veterinary clinic at the Oakland Zoo for treatment because he was ill . Jailed: Mayar was arrested and charged with drug possession charges, and is currently being held at the Santa Rita jail on $160,000 bail . Authorities noted that Mr Teeth, who looked quite sickly and undernourished, was taken to the Oakland Zoo for treatment. Mayar was arrested and charged with drug possession charges, and is currently being held at the Santa Rita jail on $160,000 bail. Fish and wildlife officials also cited Mayar with possession of a restricted-species live animal, a misdemeanor that carries a fine of as much as $3,000 and a year in jail. In the aftermath of Mr Teeth's death, its owner is also facing an animal cruelty charge. Margaret Rousser, zoological manager at the Oakland Zoo, told the San Jose Mercury that in the wild, caimans like Mr Teeth live between 20-40 years, and in captivity, their life span could extend to 60 years, provided that they plenty of space and the right environment.

Angela Merkel finally gave ground over new measures to save the stricken euro following an extraordinary night of summit brinkmanship by Italy and Spain. The German Chancellor reluctantly signed off a deal which will allow the eurozone’s £600billion bailout fund to invest directly in Spain and Italy’s  crippled banks. British sources last night insisted that no UK taxpayers’ money would be involved in the deal, as David Cameron had already extricated us from any involvement in the bailout funds. Scroll down for video . Italian Prime Minsiter Mario Monti (left) chats with German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of last night's summit. He forced Mrs Merkel to yield on her insistence on tough reforms in exchange for bailout money . Stock markets across Europe rallied on the news, despite warnings that the complex deal may prove to be yet another ‘sticking-plaster’ solution. Mrs Merkel faced an angry backlash in Germany where her previous reluctance to extend aid to the country’s profligate southern neighbours had proved popular with voters. The opposition SPD accused her of making a ‘180-degree turn’. The ‘breakthrough’ came after 14 hours of fractious talks during which Italy’s prime minister Mario Monti and his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy threatened to block a £100billion growth fund unless Mrs Merkel gave way. In an extraordinary power play they were backed up by France’s new Socialist president, Francois Hollande. The Italian media launched an extraordinary attack on Angela Merkel yesterday, as the country gloated about a ‘double victory’ over Germany. One newspaper ran a front-page headline saying simply ‘F*** Off Merkel’, while Il Giornale screamed: ‘Bye bye lard a***’. Vulgar: Italian newspapers Libero (left) and Il . Giornale (right) today launched offensive, front page assaults on Angela . Merkel following her demands, which were not met, for a stringent . bailout deal . The Italian football team upset the form book to boot Germany out of the Euro 2012 championships on Thursday. Within hours, at the Brussels summit on the future of the euro, Italy’s prime minister Mario Monti forced German chancellor Mrs Merkel to back down over her refusal to allow Europe’s bailout fund to help the continent’s struggling banks. Mr Monti emerged from 14 hours of fractious talks to declare his country had achieved a ‘double satisfaction’ over Germany. But the newspapers were far more blunt. Libero ran the headline ‘F*** off Merkel’, with an image of star striker Mario Balotelli kicking a football bearing the German leader’s face. Under fire: Mrs Merkel leaves the summit after caving-in to Italy and Spain by abandoning its demands to enforce tough reforms in exchange for rescue money . The attacks continued on page two, with a report on the football match headed: ‘Two kicks in the fat a***.’ Both publications support ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi; Il  Giornale is owned by the 75-year-old tycoon’s brother. Giovanni Melandri, the Democratic Party’s culture spokesman, said: ‘These attacks by the Berlusconi press on Mrs Merkel are  vulgar, churlish and disgusting. ‘They’re also extremely misogynist.’ Mr Monti even threatened to keep the EU’s 27 leaders in Brussels until Sunday night unless a deal was struck. Shortly after 4am, Mrs Merkel’s resistance finally crumbled. In a symbol of the EU’s increasingly two-speed nature, the deal was thrashed out by the 17 eurozone leaders three hours after Mr Cameron and the heads of other non-euro countries had gone to bed. The new initiative is designed to ease the pressure on Spain and Italy, which have seen their borrowing costs rise to unsustainable levels in recent months because of problems with their banks and debts. Back of the net: A few hours earlier, Italian striker Mario Balotelli provided a similar thrill for his countrymen by firing two goals past the Germans to take Italy to the finals of Euro 2012 . In return, Mrs Merkel demanded agreement that all of the eurozone’s banks would come under the supervision of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Mr Cameron yesterday claimed victory for forcing the EU to back down over plans to hand Brussels control over the regulation of ‘all’ European banks. The final deal covers only banks in the eurozone countries, leaving the supervision of British banks in London. The new initiative was widely viewed as the first step on the road towards the creation of a powerful fiscal union. French President Francois Hollande'It . is very important that we put into motion procedures for immediate . action - something that was much hoped for. Bank supervision for a . recapitalisation of the banks will take a bit more time, but this will . be a lasting move in the right direction. 'We . defined a vision for the euro - for economic and monetary union - . saying what we will do together, and there will be greater solidarity at . each step in integration.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel'We have taken important decisions last night. I am very satisfied that we took good decisions on growth.' Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite . 'We . are heading for a future where we will need very general supervisory . bodies to look more carefully, more strictly, and which are more . responsible for the financial sector and banking sector, and that's . where we are heading. 'I . hope that in a very few weeks, the euro zone leaders will be able to . find a concrete mechanism for how to control the not-very-well-behaving . banks and to help them.' European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said officials would now draw up a detailed plan for ‘genuine economic and monetary union’ within the Eurozone. ‘The aim is to make the euro an irreversible project,’ he said. In a key concession by Germany, the leaders agreed to waive the bailout fund’s preferred creditor status on lending for Spanish banks, removing a key deterrent to investors buying Spanish government bonds, who feared having to take the first losses in any debt restructuring. ‘We have taken decisions that were unthinkable just some months ago,’ European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said. But the deal does not involve any new money and many questions remain about how it might work.One British source said: ‘They’ve kicked the can a bit further down the road this time, but there is still a lot to do.’ Marc Ostwald, market strategist at Monument Securities, said: ‘While there may be some temporary sense of relief that the summit has not descended in to acrimonious discord, what has been thus far agreed is nothing more than sticking plaster.’ The deal also includes a pledge to re-examine the strict austerity measures imposed on Ireland as part of its bailout deal. But the deal played badly in Germany where Mrs Merkel headed straight to Berlin in a bid to sell it to MPs. Asked if she had yielded to pressure, she said: ‘There is clearly pressure from financial markets. Some countries are in a difficult situation. The high interest rates affect the debt but also the real economy. We had an interest in finding solutions.’ But the influential German magazine Der Spiegel said Mrs Merkel had ‘caved in on the most important points’. The magazine accused the Chancellor of leading Germany into an unpopular ‘debt union’, adding: ‘The reactions at home were devastating; even the vote on the fiscal pact in parliament wobbled. Merkel’s advisers seemed surprised by the force of the attacks.’ The Sueddeutsche newspaper said Mrs Merkel’s compromises ‘represent some of the biggest changes in the management of the European debt crisis since Greece received its first rescue package’.

'I would like to apologize to Mark's family and friends for what I . did to them. I would like to apologize to my family,' Towery said. 'So many times in my . life I went left when I should have gone right and I went right when I . should have gone left. It was mistake after mistake.' According to the Arizona Republic, he looked at his family and began crying, before adding: 'I love my family. Potato, potato, potato.' Chamber: Towery, 47, was executed in Arizona State Prison, pictured, despite numerous pleas from his attorneys to change his sentence to life in prison . He took a few heavy breaths and began sleeping. The execution took nine minutes and Towery was declared dead at 11.26 a.m. Potatoes may have been on his mind after his last meal before his execution included a baked potato with . sour cream. Mark Stroman (2011): ‘Let’s do this damn thing’ Stroman was executed in Texas after he went on a shooting spree following the 9/11 attacks, killing three people he thought were Muslims. Thomas J. Grasso (1995): ‘I did not get my Spaghetti-O’s, I got spaghetti. I want the press to know this’ Grasso was executed in Oklahoma for a double murder. His last meal included a can of Franco-American Spaghetti-O’s. John Wayne Gacy (1994): ‘Kiss my ass! You’ll never find the rest’ The ‘Killer Clown’ was convicted of the rapes and murders of 33 men between 1972 and 1978. George Appel (1928): ‘Well, gentlemen… you are about to see a baked Appel' Moments before his execution, he also said, ‘Damn, no power outage.’ He was executed via electric chair for robbery and the murder of a New York City police officer. Edward H. Rulloff (1870): ‘I’d like to be in hell in time for dinner’ Known as the ‘Man of Two Lives’ for his paradoxical lives of respected educator and swindler, he was hanged for the murder of his wife and daughter. He also ate porterhouse steak, asparagus, mushrooms, clam chowder, milk, Pepsi and apple . pie a la mode. His attorneys had made several unsuccessful arguments to spare his life - including a request at the 11th hour to reduce the sentence to 25 years as his accomplice had served only 10 years behind bars. Randy Allen Barker was given a plea deal for testifying against Towery and was released from jail in 2001. Yet Towery's lawyers had argued that Barker, holding a gun, had watched the prolonged killing and 'exhibited extreme indifference to human life'. 'He could have stopped Mr. Towery,' the file read. 'Mr. Towery was unarmed, and had neither physically assaulted nor threatened Mr. Barker.' But the court did not believe the . sentencing was disproportionate and turned down their request less than . two hours after receiving the filing. In . other attempts, his attorneys said the court did not consider . mitigating factors, such as an abusive childhood at the hands of his . mother and drug abuse. Last week, Towery himself pleaded with . the clemency board to change the sentence to life in prison instead, . while apologising to Jones's family. 'I have the deepest regrets for what I did and I'm truly sorry for their . loss, for what I did to them,"" he said. 'It's a terrible thing that I . did and it should never have happened. I can only pray that they . will find peace and that someday they'll be able to forgive me.' Then: With an accomplice, Towery (left and right) went to the home of Jones, an acquaintance. The men robbed his home and car and Towery strangled him . Scene: The murder took place in the affluent Paradise Valley, Arizona . Towery and Barker had discussed robbing Jones as Towery - who had borrowed money from Jones in the past - knew he had money. During Barker's trial, he said they went to Jones's home claiming their car had broken down and they needed to use his phone. Dead: Robert Henry Moormann, who killed his mother, was put to death in Arizona eight days before . Towery then pulled a gun out while Barker handcuffed him, before the duo loaded Jones' car with electronics, jewelery, credit cards and cash. They . marched him to his bedroom at gunpoint where Towery attempted to inject . the victim's arm with battery acid. When that did not work, he . strangled him with plastic ties, making two separate nooses. Jones' body was found the next day. The men were caught when a security guard . said he had seen them dump the vehicle at an apartment complex. His . death comes eight days after Robert Henry Moormann was executed for killing and . dismembering his adoptive mother as she slept in 1984. Moormann . was the first Arizona inmate to be executed with one lethal drug, as . opposed to the state's long-standing, three-drug protocol. The switch was made after it was realised on Monday that one of the drugs had expired. Towery was killed with the same drug.

The head of the NHS is facing calls to resign over his role in one of the worst hospital scandals in history. Sir David Nicholson helped appoint the chief executive who presided over Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust at a time when up to 1,200 patients died through neglect. He is one of numerous executives who prospered despite their links to the scandal, described yesterday by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt as a ‘shocking betrayal of NHS founding values’. Scandal: A public inquiry will to recommend hospitals are fined or closed if they cover-up blunders in the wake of the tragedy at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for the deaths of up to 1,200 patients . Today Sir David, who was appointed chief executive of the NHS in 2006, earns more than £200,000 a year. Between 400 and 1,200 patients are thought to have died at Stafford hospital from 2005 to 2008, with some left so thirsty they were forced to drink water from vases next to their beds. Later this month a report will call for sweeping changes to the Health Service to ensure such a disaster cannot happen again. It will describe a ‘culture of fear’ at Mid Staffordshire, which runs two hospitals, Stafford and Cannock Chase, with managers more obsessed with meeting targets than protecting patients. In January 2006 Sir David, at the time head of a regional health authority, was on a panel of NHS managers that interviewed Mr Yeates and appointed him as full-time chief executive of the trust. The decision was made even though Mr Yeates had no formal management training. He resigned in 2009 and received a reported £400,000 pay-off. But the career of Sir David – a member of the Communist Party until 1983 – has blossomed. He was also recently appointed chief executive of the NHS Commissioning Board, a new body that will oversee hospitals and GP services. Although he is expected to be heavily criticised in the forthcoming report, it is unlikely that he will be sacked as he is such a powerful figure in the Health Service. Arthur Peacham, 68, (left) died of C.difficile at Stafford Hospital after being left . on filthy wards.  Joan Giles, 81, (right) died after suffering severe bed sores . But relatives of patients who died say he must resign or be sacked because his position is untenable. Julie Bailey, who helped expose Stafford hospital’s failings following the death of her mother Bella and started the campaign group Cure the NHS, said: ‘Our relatives suffered at the hands of these professionals. Nobody spoke out and nobody was there to protect them.’ Not a single nurse or doctor working at the hospital at the time has been struck off. The Mail understands that 37 nurses were referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council, but 25 were not deemed to have done wrong. Another 11 are still having their cases considered by the watchdog, nearly five years later. One was handed a three-month suspension, but she was already planning to retire. While 41 doctors were referred to their regulator, the General Medical Council, not one has yet been struck off. The failings at Mid Staffordshire emerged in March 2009 in a report by the Healthcare Commission which described how sick and dying patients were ‘routinely neglected’, ‘inhumanely treated’ and ‘bullied’. Its findings prompted a public inquiry lasting two years, chaired by Robert Francis QC. He will present his findings later this month and is expected to call for sweeping changes to the NHS, including better regulation of managers and an overhaul of nurses’ training.","Probe into deaths at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust .

Drivers in rural Missouri had a miraculous escape in the early hours of Saturday after a train crash caused an overpass to collapse in flames.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:45 EST, 23 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:45 EST, 24 May 2013 . Los Angeles police have obtained the decades-old taped conversations between a Manson family disciple and his attorney, which may tie the murderous cult to additional killings. Detective David Holmes said Thursday the department has had the tapes for a couple of weeks and Robbery-Homicide Division and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office are analyzing them. A federal judge in Texas ruled in March that Charles ‘Tex’ Watson waived his right to attorney-client privilege when he allowed his lawyer to sell the eight cassette tapes to an author nearly 40 years ago for a book on his life. Then and now: Manson follower Charles 'Tex' Watson, pictured left in 1971 and right in 2011, has said that the family did not kill anyone other than actress Sharon Tate and six others . The tapes, which were converted to electronic audio files, are being reviewed to determine whether there's evidence that could resolve unsolved murders. Watson is serving a life sentence for his role in the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and six others. He sought to prevent turnover of the tapes. Watson has said in the past the Manson family wasn't responsible for any other killings. The tapes were discovered last year by a trustee handling the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case of the law firm were Watson's attorney Bill Boyd was a partner. Boyd died in 2009. On the recordings that resurfaced in February, Boyd reportedly said that Manson had told his client that he killed 'a bunch of other people'. In 1969, the Manson family murdered seven people including film director Roman Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate under the direction of the charismatic ex-convict. Accusations: Charles 'Tex' Watson (left) allegedly told his lawyer that Charles Manson (right) had murdered many more people . Dark secrets: Manson family lawyer Billy Boyd (pictured) allegedly says on previously unheard tapes that Manson had murdered before the Sharon Tate killings . A voice, which is allegedly Boyd's, says that beside the seven known murders, Manson had told Watson he had killed alone, according to a recording obtained by Fox. Billy Boyd died in 2009, while Watson is serving a life sentence. Boyd said in the recordings, while speaking to an author, that his client was not implicated in any of these crimes. Watson was originally sentenced to death for killing Sharon Tate Polanski, Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Thomas Jay Sebring and Steven Earl Parent but California suspended the death penalty in 1972. Despite multiple attempts at parole, Manson is still behind bars for orchestrating the brutal killings, which he dubbed 'Helter Skelter' - in a deeply disturbed tribute to the Beatles song. The lawyer had taped 20 hours of conversations with Watson as they prepared for his murder trial. Murdered: Actress Sharon Tate was eight and a half months pregnant when she was killed by Manson's followers on his orders . LAPD Chief Charlie Beck asked the Department of Justice to hand over the tapes, which had been the property of Boyd's Texas law firm which went bankrupt last year. Watson tried to stop the tapes becoming public, saying their release was a 'public dishonor' to those affected by the Manson murders, but he ultimately failed. The recordings were private until September 1976 when Watson authorized their sale to author Chaplain Ray Hoekstra to help cover legal fees. The material was used in Mr Hoekstra's book 'Will You Die For Me?' which was released in 1976. Charles Manson, now 77, is one of America's most notorious mass murderers. Amid the hippie culture of the 1960s, . the ex-convict put together a collection of runaways and outcasts known . as the Manson Family. In . the summer of 1969, he became one of the 20th century's most infamous . criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder . seven people. Actress . Sharon Tate was stabbed 16 times by members of the cult in the early . morning hours of August 9, 1969 at the Benedict Canyon estate, sheltered . in the hills of Los Angeles. She was eight and a half months pregnant. Life in prison: Charles Manson, who orchestrated his cult to murder seven people, will not be eligible for parole until he is 92 . Four other people were stabbed or shot to death in Tate's home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word 'Pig' in blood on the front door before leaving. The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write 'Rise,' 'Death to Pigs' and 'Helter Skelter' - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song - on the walls and refrigerator door. Manson is imprisoned at Corcoran State Prison in Kings County, California. He was convicted of the seven slayings as well as the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in July 1969. Like Watson, he was originally given a death sentence but spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Manson will next be eligible for parole in 15 years, when he will be 92-years-old. When he was denied release in 2007 the parole board ruled that he 'continues to pose an unreasonable danger to others and may still bring harm to anyone he would come in contact with'.","Lawyer Billy Boyd had 20 hours of conversations with convicted murderer Charles Watson at his Texas law firm .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:26 EST, 26 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:33 EST, 26 May 2013 . Thousands of heavily-trafficked bridges around the U.S. may be one accident or mistake away from collapse, even if the spans are deemed structurally sound, officials warned today. The crossings are kept standing by engineering design, not supported with brute strength or redundant protections like their more modern counterparts. Bridge regulators call the more risky spans 'fracture critical' meaning that if a single, vital component of the bridge is compromised, it can crumple. Those vulnerable crossings carry millions of drivers every day. In Boston, a six-lane highway 1A near Logan airport includes a 'fracture critical' bridge over Bennington Street. In northern Chicago, an I-90 pass that goes over Ashland Avenue is in the same category, as is an I-880 bridge over 5th Avenue in Oakland, California. Also on that list is the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River north of Seattle, which collapsed into the water days ago after officials say an over-sized truck load clipped the steel truss. Wreckage: The section of the Skagit River bridge that collapsed, sending cars and passengers plunging into the river below . Public officials have focused in recent years on the desperate need for money to repair thousands of bridges deemed structurally deficient, which typically means a major portion of the bridge is in poor condition or worse. But the bridge that collapsed Thursday is not in that deficient category, highlighting another major problem with the nation's infrastructure: although it's rare, some bridges deemed to be fine structurally can still be crippled if they are struck hard enough in the wrong spot. 'It probably is a bit of a fluke in that sense,' said Charles Roeder, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington. While the I-5 truck's cargo suffered only minimal damage, it left chaos in its wake, with two vehicles catapulting off the edge of the broken bridge into the river below. Three people involved escaped with non-life threatening injuries. Officials asked people to plan for an . extra hour to make their way through detours around the collapsed . bridge. There are three detour options northbound and two options . southbound. About 71,000 vehicles use that . stretch of highway every day. Late Saturday morning, traffic was moving . freely through the detours. Officials were looking for a . temporary, pre-fabricated bridge to replace the 160-foot section that . failed, Governor Jay Inslee said Friday. That option could be in place . in weeks. Otherwise, it could be months before a replacement can be . built, the governor said. Survivor: Motorist Bryce Kenning sits on the roof of his car after it fell into the Skagit River when the Interstate 5 bridge collapsed minutes earlier on Thursday . Inslee said it will cost $15 million . to repair the bridge. The federal government has promised $1 million in . emergency dollars and more money could come later, according to . Washington's congressional delegation. The Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board Debbie Hersman and her team . will spend a week to 10 days looking at the bridge, talking to the . truck driver whose vehicle hit it, and examining maintenance documents . and previous accident reports. They'll be watching for safety issues that could affect other bridges. Washington . state officials said Saturday that it will take time to find both . short- and long-term fixes for the bridge that collapsed on Interstate . 5. The most famous failure of a fracture . critical bridge was the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis . during rush hour on Aug. 1, 2007, killing 13 people and injuring more . than 100 others. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that . the cause of the collapse was an error by the bridge's designers — a . gusset plate, a key component of the bridge, was too thin. The plate was . only half of the required one-inch thickness . Because . the bridge's key structures lacked redundancy, where if one piece . fails, there is another piece to prevent the bridge from falling, when . the gusset plate broke, much of the bridge collapsed. Mark . Rosenker, who was chairman of the NTSB during the I-35W bridge . investigation, said the board looked into whether other fracture . critical bridges were collapsing. They found a few cases, but not many, . he said. 'Today, they're still building fracture critical bridges with the belief that they're not going break,' Rosenker said. Fracture critical bridges, like the . I-5 span in Washington, are the result of Congress trying to cut corners . to save money rather than a lack of engineering know-how, said Barry B. LePatner, a New York real estate attorney and author of 'Too Big to . Fall: America's Failing Infrastructure and the Way Forward.' Collapse: The I5 bridge in Seattle, Washington, had been deemed 'functionally obsolete' by state authorities before it collapsed after being clipped by a truck . About 18,000 fracture . critical bridges were built from the mid-1950s through the late 1970s in . an effort to complete the nation's interstate highway system, which was . launched under President Dwight Eisenhower, LePatner said in an . interview. The fracture critical bridge designs were cheaper than . bridges designed with redundancy, he said. Thousands of those bridges remain in use, according to an AP analysis. 'They . have been left hanging with little maintenance for four decades now,' he said. 'There is little political will and less political leadership . to commit the tens of billions of dollars needed' to fix them. There . has been little focus or urgency in specifically replacing the older . 'fracture critical' crossings, in part because there is a massive . backlog of bridge repair work for thousands of bridges deemed to be . structurally problematic. Washington state Rep. Judy Clibborn, a . Democrat who leads the House transportation committee, has been trying . to build support for a tax package to pay for major transportation . projects in the state. But her plan wouldn't have done anything to . revamp the bridge that collapsed. National bridge records say the I-5 . crossing over the Skagit River had a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of . 100 — a score designed to gauge the ability of the bridge to remain in . service. To qualify for federal replacement funds, a bridge must have a . rating of 50 or below. A bridge must have a sufficiency rating of 80 or . below to qualify for federal rehabilitation funding. Hundreds . of bridges in Washington state have worse ratings than the one that . collapsed, and many around the country have single-digit ratings. Human chain: Rescue workers pulled three people from the water after the Skagit River bridge collapse, none were critically injured . Clibborn . said the Skagit River crossing wasn't even on the radar of lawmakers . because state officials have to prioritize by focusing on bridges with . serious structural problems that are at higher risk of imminent danger. Along . with being at risk of a fatal impact, the I-5 bridge was deemed to be . 'functionally obsolete,' which essentially means it wasn't built to . today's standards. Its shoulders were narrow, and it had low clearance. There . are 66,749 structurally deficient bridges and 84,748 functionally . obsolete bridges in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, according to the . Federal Highway Administration. That's about a quarter of the 607,000 . total bridges nationally. States and cities have been whittling down . that backlog, but slowly. In 2002, about 30 percent of bridges fell into . one of those two categories . There is wide recognition at all levels of government that the failure to address aging infrastructure will likely undermine safety and hinder economic growth. But there is no consensus on how to pay for improvements. The federal Highway Trust Fund, which provides construction aid to states, is forecast to go broke next year. The fund gets its revenue primarily from federal gas and diesel taxes. But revenues aren't keeping up because people are driving less and there are more fuel-efficient cars on the road. Delay: The collapsed bridge in Skagit, Washington, carried 71,000 vehicles daily. Drivers are being asked to factor in an extra hour travel time to detour the bridge . Neither Congress nor the White House has shown any willingness to raise federal gas taxes, which haven't been increased since 1993. Many transportation thinkers believe a shift to taxes based on miles traveled by a vehicle is inevitable, but there are privacy concerns and other difficulties that would preclude widespread use of such a system for at least a decade. Transportation spending got a temporary boost with the economic stimulus funds approved by Congress after President Barack Obama was elected. Of the $27 billion designated for highway projects under the stimulus program, about $3 billion went to bridge projects, Black said. States are looking for other means to raise money for highway and bridge improvements, including more road tolls, dedicating a portion of sales taxes to transportation and raising state gas taxes. Clibborn, the Washington state lawmaker, has proposed a 10-cent gas hike to help pay for projects, though the effort has been held up by a dispute over how to rebuild the Columbia River bridge connecting Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. 'We can't possibly do it all in the next 10 years,' Clibborn said. 'But we're going to do the first bite of the apple.'","Thousands of bridges in use across the country 'functionally obsolete'

"In April 2011, a woman who answered Salim's Craigslist ad called 911 to report being accosted by the doctor . Salim tried to hire aspiring model to paint internal organs on her stomach for $400 . By . Helen Pow and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:17 EST, 25 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:43 EST, 26 May 2013 . Charged: Doctor Ali Salim, pictured, is charged with murdering pregnant mother of two, Deanna Ballman, after she responded to a Craigslist ad . An Ohio doctor who is suspected of raping and killing a pregnant mother of two last summer has been linked to two earlier incidents involving one woman who accused him of sexual assault, and another who claimed that he accosted her. Pakistani-born Dr Ali Salim is accused of murdering Deanna Ballman, of Pataskala, and her unborn baby last July by injecting her with a lethal dose of heroin and then doing 'inhumane' things to her corpse. Ballman, who was nine-months pregnant and had two kids at home, was found dead in the backseat of her car in woods outside of New Albany on August 1. Salim, 44, pleaded not guilty in February to two counts of murder as well as rape, felonious assault, corrupting another with drugs, kidnapping, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. He remains on house arrest on $1million bond. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 3. Salim's life was full of drama in the months before his encounter with Ballman, according to police records obtained by the AP, prosecutors' statements and interviews with Delaware County sheriff's investigators. In September 2010, Salim told police his house had been burglarized with the help of a female heroin addict he'd been trying to help get treatment. He refused to cooperate with investigators despite losing three TVs, two laptops, $500 in cash and credit cards, and the case was placed on inactive status, according to a Columbus police report. Dead: Deanna Ballman, pictured, was allegedly killed by Salim last summer . Tragic: Ballman, pictured left and right, was nine-months pregnant and a mother-of-two kids, pictured right . In April 2011, a woman who answered . one of Salim's Craigslist ads called 911 to report an assault at Salim's . address. ‘I came to a gentleman's house, and he accosted me,’ she said. Eight months later, in early . December, aspiring model Gabrielle Roush answered what she thought was a . legitimate modeling ad: $400 to let Salim paint the human digestive . system on her abdomen for what he said was a work assignment. But Roush, accompanied by her future . father-in-law, turned down the job after Salim insisted she be in the . house alone while he worked. ‘He said, ""As long as you don't cause . drama, you can do this for me,""' recalled Roush, 21, a college student . in Columbus, whose meeting with Salim and call to police came long . before Ballman's death and Salim's arrest. The following July, a woman was . sexually assaulted at Salim's house, according to a report she filed . with police a month later, after Ballman's death. Witness: Aspiring model Gabrielle Roush answered an ad placed by Salim offering $400 to let a woman paint the human digestive system on her abdomen . According to Ballman's family, the . woman was responding to a housecleaning ad and called to say she wasn't . feeling well, which was the last they heard of her. However, reports suggest she may have met with Salim after he put a call out for models. Salim has been at the center of the investigation into Ballman's death for months, with 10TV reporting in September that investigators had searched the doctor's Ohio home and removed a laptop, camera and other items. Assistant county prosecutor Kyle Rohrer . said Salim treated Ballman's body 'in a very inhumane way,' but wouldn't . elaborate on how. Prosecutors believe the doctor, who has gone by the cyber handle 'extremephotoenthusias,' has sought out other women through Craigslist. Rohrer said other women had responded to ads placed by Salim, including one woman who said Salim wanted to paint the digestive system on her abdomen. According to an email obtained by 10TV in September the doctor wrote that he was willing to pay $300 if young women can keep their work 'drama free,' adding 'I just don't need the drama.' In court: Dr. Ali Salim, pictured, waits for deputies to escort him from the courtroom after he pleaded not guilty to charges of killing Ballman on Thursday . Unclear: Ballman's family claim she was responding to a housecleaning ad though reports suggest she met with Salim to model for him . He also told women that they could 'wear . anything but black or brown bra, and panties are essential. I will take . most shots from the back.' Salim, who is single, is originally from Pakistan where he earned his medical degree at King Edward Medical College at the University of the Punjab in 1993, according to Ohio medical board records. He did his residency at West Virginia University and worked most recently as an emergency room physician in Mt. Vernon, a small city in east-central Ohio. The Ohio medical board has revoked Salim's license because of the criminal charges. He had no medical disciplinary cases as a doctor and no previous criminal record. He is a permanent U.S. resident with a green card. He lived in a $305,000 house in New Albany, a tony Columbus suburb, and owned expensive cars, including a Porsche and Infiniti. He drove his vehicles fast: Records obtained by The Associated Press found at least 15 speeding tickets since 2000. Ballman, 23, was a supply specialist with a National Guard military police unit in Colorado who had just moved back to Ohio after separating from her husband. She had her own apartment east of Columbus and was still trying to buy furniture for her children's bedrooms. The family reported her missing July 31, telling police about the housecleaning ad. At 3.30pm that day, Deanna Ballman called her mother, Lori Ballman. ‘Deanna stated that she felt dizzy and did not feel well. Deanna then stopped talking. Lori stated a male with a foreign accent then got on the phone asking what he could do to help. The call was then lost,’ according to the missing-person's report. Mother's anguish: Lori Ballman was the last person to hear from her daughter, Deanna, a supply specialist with the National Guard, before the pregnant 23-year-old mother of two turned out dead from a heroin overdose . Lori Ballman also told investigators she heard the sound of a woman's voice in the background speaking another language. Investigators say they've never located this person. O'Brien, the Delaware County prosecutor, says it's not clear how Deanna Ballman's car got to the country road.Compounding the family's struggle, Ballman's 19-year-old brother, James, died in an accidental shooting in February. Deanna Ballman's children are in foster care in Colorado, her mother said. Ballman was a high school graduate and devoted mother who hoped eventually to go to college to be a dentist, her mother said. Lori Ballman helped her daughter gather cleaning supplies the day she disappeared, but she believes now that was a cover story for something darker she can't quite bring herself to name.‘That's the only reason I can think she told me she was going housecleaning, because she was humiliated,’ Ballman said. Salim's lawyer, Sam Shamansky bluntly called Ballman an ‘unfortunate victim’ who died as a result of prostituting herself to feed a drug habit. ‘Regrettably, she caused her own demise and Dr. Salim had nothing to do with it,’ said attorney Sam Shamansky. Inhumane: Salim allegedly did inhumane things to Ballman's body . Fetish: Salim reportedly was fixated on photographing young women like Ballman, pictured . The rape charge against Salim alleges . he assaulted her knowing her ability to resist ‘was substantially . impaired.’ Capt. Kevin Savage of the Delaware County Sheriff's Office . says there's no evidence Ballman was a drug addict. But, like the prosecutor, he hints that Ballman's reasons for going to Salim's home have yet to come out. ‘I . don't think she knew she was going to be overdosed with heroin and . subsequently die, but I think she knew what she was responding to,’ Savage said. Ballman died . of a heroin overdose but also had morphine and codine in her blood at . the time of her death and her urine contained morphine, . monoacetylmorphine, codeine, acetylocodine and diacetylmorphine. When . asked if Ballman was responding to a housecleaning ad before she was . killed, Delaware County Prosecutor Carol O'Brien said on Thursday . 'that's not quite what we've found.' Booked: Salim, pictured, was booked into Delaware County Jail on Wednesday . Crime scene: Ballman's body was found in her car, pictured, in a wooded area near New Albany on August 1 . Rohrer said Salim tried to tamper with evidence and would be a flight risk once he learns that investigators recovered it. 'We believe this is not an isolated . incident and that he remains a threat to others in the public if he's . released,' Rohrer said. O'Brien declined to elaborate after the hearing on what exactly Salim is accused of doing to Ballman's corpse. Salim's . attorney said he has represented Salim since last summer and throughout . the investigation, including a meeting with investigators in October . where Salim provided hair samples.","Pakistani-born Dr Ali Salim, 44, is accused of murdering pregnant Deanna Ballman and her unborn baby last summer .

Harvey admitted burglary by entering the house as a trespasser with intent to do unlawful damage at Plymouth Crown Court. The out-of-work plumber invited nine of his friends to the house, but said he alone was responsible for the mess after finding a tin of white paint under the stairs. Police traced Harvey through a finger print on a cider can discarded at the property in Plymouth. Judge Paul Darlow said: 'This was a mean and nasty act of vandalism. 'The fact you were drunk makes matters worse.' Harvey's defence barrister Nick Lewin said: 'This was an act of stupidity rather than pure criminality. 'It is not worth throwing away the key on him yet, he is not rotten. If he goes to prison he runs the risk of becoming rotten.'

Happy again: Pat Ekins, pictured working at the Emmaus charity in Colchester, Essex, has turned her life around after losing her life savings to a Turkish toyboy lover . A grandmother who sold her house and lost her life savings after being duped by a toyboy Turkish bar owner ended up having to sleep rough. Lovestruck Pat Ekins, 50, was left broke and snubbed by her angry family after selling her house behind her children's backs and pumping £70,000 into the business of 28-year-old Ibrahim Halin who she met on holiday in the Turkish resort of Marmaris. Pat, from Preston, Lancashire, would fly back and forth between Turkey and her then home town of Middlesborough, North Yorkshire every couple of months. But no sooner had she handed the money over to her toyboy, he had fled leaving Pat, who was 46 at the time, desolate and facing eviction from her apartment. She said: 'I sold the house without telling them and took all the money, £70,000, to fund this bar in Turkey. 'It was the house I had shared with my ex-husband, the father of my youngest daughter. We had agreed that if and when I sold it, the money would be split three ways. 'He told me we would make the money back and more within a year, so I thought I would be able to go back to my daughters and give them their share, with some extra. But it didn't happen like that. 'I went to Turkey and transferred all the money into his account. 'He left the apartment, saying he was going to sign the papers, but he didn't come back. The next day he still wasn't there and I knew what had happened. 'It was horrible. I thought we were happy. I was happy. I hit rock bottom.' Grandmother-of-three Pat, found herself sleeping on the floor of a barber's shop in the popular resort after being evicted from her flat until a friend paid for her to come home. But things went from bad to worse on her return when her family told her they did not want anything to do with her because of what she had done. She said: 'Claire swore at me and told me to keep away from them. My mum, sisters and brother said they didn't want anything to do with me anymore. 'I had broken my daughters' hearts. 'That night I had nowhere to go. I just kept walking around the park. It was unbelievable. I was frightened to go to sleep but I eventually did - on a park bench. 'After losing everything I spent a week sleeping on a park bench, rummaging through the bins for food. 'It was a proper reality check. I thought, what I am doing here after everything I had going for me? All for a man.' Pat had left John, the father of 27-year-old Karen, after 11 years and moved from Preston to Middlesbrough after her life spiralled out of control. She admitted: 'I started drinking and went off the rails. I was working in a pub and would leave Claire, who was 13, to look after Karen while I stayed on at the pub and drank. 'Claire fell pregnant quite young and left home, so I had to get back on my feet for Karen. 'Thinking about it now I was being selfish, but I didn't think that at the time. I would buy them presents because I felt guilty and at one point had three jobs. 'But I struggled to pay rent and we would keep moving house, disappearing in the middle of the night. 'I was using cannabis and speed and gambling and mixing with the wrong people. 'All this time Karen was growing up and becoming aware of what was going on.' Holiday resort: Pat met the 28-year-old Turkish bar owner who duped her of her cash in the popular resort of Marmaris, pictured . After finding herself outcast from her family after losing her savings to the Turkish bar owner, Pat linked up with the charity Emmaus after being told about them by an old friend three years ago. She worked in their shop in return for a bed to sleep in and a £35-a-week allowance. And she says that helped turned her life around. Now she is living in Colchester, Essex. She said: 'I have lived and worked with Emmaus in Hastings, visited Paris with them for a big fair to raise money for Africa, and I came to Colchester in November last year. 'It's like a big family. There is security, work. We have our ups and downs but it is all aired and we get on with it. 'I still keep in touch with Karen and she sent me pictures of the grandchildren but I have no intention of going back to Preston. They know where I am. 'My mum isn't well but I don't think I will go to her funeral when the time comes. I can pay my respects here. They were not there for me when I was on the streets. 'Now I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I have my self esteem back and my life. Emmaus is a reason for me to get out of bed in the morning.'","Pat Ekins met 28-year-old Ibrahim Halin in the resort of Marmaris .

Concerns are growing amongst residents of the upmarket Hamptons that their exclusive beaches are set to be overrun by less desirable visitors this summer driven north by Superstorm Sandy’s devastating impact on the Jersey Shore. For so long an exclusive enclave for the rich and famous, the group of villages and hamlets which form the South Fork of Long Island, New York have some of the most expensive residential properties in the U.S. Last year, a young and rowdy party crowd started regularly showing up at Indian Wells Beach in East Hampton. Last year Indian Wells Beach in East Hampton was invaded by a young and rowdy party crowd and locals are fearing worse this summer . Peace and tranquility: Residents in the Hamptons are concerned that their unspoilt beaches will be overrun by young party-goers who would typically party on the Jersey Shore . The beach is so exclusive that only cars with the blue-and-white permits of local homeowners can parked in its lot, but the out-of-towners got around this by being dropped off and picked up by buses and vans - at least one was seen flying a pirate flag. Suddenly locals were faced with over-crowded beaches full of twenty-somethings hauling kegs of beer, out for a good time and not concerned about not fitting in with the local khakis and blue blazer brigade. This year residents throughout the Hamptons are bracing themselves for an even greater invasion exacerbated they fear by Superstorm Sandy having destroyed the more traditional habitat of this young crowd – the Jersey Shore. Paranoia is growing that Indian Wells Beach and others will be overrun with the type of reckless young party-goers best personified by Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi and the rest of the Gudios and Guidettes from the cast of MTV’s ‘Jersey Shore’ reality show. Hamptons locals are increasingly concerned about a growing influx of young party-goers best typified by Snooki from the reality show 'Jersey Shore' Hamptons locals have complained about an influx of young out-of-towners who travel to their beaches via coaches to avoid the rules preventing them from parking by the beach . ‘You don’t want to come across as snooty, but it’s about peace and quiet for all of us,’ said Dayna Winter, 49, a registered dietician and a year-round resident told The New York Times. ‘It’s not a party scene; it’s not what we want it to become.’ ‘With the devastation of Sandy,’ she added, ‘we’re all a little nervous.’ Other residents fear their neighbourhood is in danger of losing its identity and in one local’s words is in danger of ‘becoming Cancun during Spring Break.’ The old money set has already had to endure the arrival of the nouveau riche  - most recently Jennifer Lopez - with their mega-mansions, corporate planes and over-the-top tent parties, but an even greater fear it seems is this new group of day-trippers hell-bent on having a good time. In a bid to see off the packed buses and vans driving through the residents-only parking lot, a weekend ban on allowing parking lot non-resident vehicles longer than 30 feet or carrying more than eight passengers are being considered. Hamptons invasion: Locals in the exclusive area known for it's expensive properties are concerned that growing numbers of young people are visiting the area to party and enjoy the beaches . ‘There was a time when you had to be on the inside to be part of the Hamptons, and that’s not true anymore,’ East Hampton-based author Steven Gaines told The Times. ‘It’s become a tourist stop, and it has lost some of its exclusivity.’ Meanwhile Snooki and the rest of the 'Jersey Shore' cast where in Seaside Heights, N.J. on Friday to help open the resort for summer, even if it is still very much a work in progress. Saws and sledgehammers joined beer and barbecues as a fixture of the first Memorial Day weekend at the Jersey shore since Superstorm Sandy roared through. Seven months after the devastating storm pummeled large swaths of the shore, the tourists made their way back, though many substituted porch parties for a day at the beach on Saturday due to rain that has lingered since Thursday. Speaking on 'Today' on Friday, Snooki declared: 'Everyone’s here and it’s getting rebuilt.' The residents of the Hamptons will be hoping those words will be enough to encourage Snooki's fellow Guidettes and Guidos to party at the Shore rather than taking a trip further north.

"By . Ap and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:53 EST, 25 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:19 EST, 25 May 2013 . A federal judge ruled Friday that the office of America's self-proclaimed toughest sheriff systematically singled out Latinos in its trademark immigration patrols, marking the first finding by a court that the agency racially profiles people. The decision by U.S. District Judge Murray Snow in Phoenix backs up years of allegations from Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's critics who say his officers violate the constitutional rights of Latinos in relying on race in their immigration enforcement.Snow, whose ruling came more than eight months after a seven-day, non-jury trial, also ruled Arpaio's deputies unreasonably prolonged the detentions of people who were pulled over. Racial profiler: America's self-proclaimed 'toughest sheriff' has claimed for more than a decade that his office doesn't profile Latinos . The ruling marks a thorough repudiation of the immigration patrols that made Arpaio a national political figure, and it represents a victory for those who pushed the lawsuit.'For too long the sheriff has been victimizing the people he's meant to serve with his discriminatory policy,' said Cecillia D. Wang, director of the ACLU Immigrants' Right Project. 'Today we're seeing justice for everyone in the county.'Monetary damages weren't sought in the lawsuit but rather a declaration that Arpaio's office engages in racial profiling and an order that requires it to make policy changes.Stanley Young, the lead lawyer who argued the case against Arpaio, said Snow set a hearing for June 14 where he will hear from the two sides on how to make sure the orders in the ruling are carried out.The sheriff, who has repeatedly denied the allegations, won't face jail time as a result of Friday's ruling.Tim Casey, Arapio's lead attorney in the case, said an appeal was planned in the next 30 days.'In the meantime, we will meet with the court and comply with the letter and spirit of the order,' he said.A small group of Latinos alleged in their lawsuit that Arpaio's deputies pulled over some vehicles only to make immigration status checks. The group asked Snow to issue injunctions barring the sheriff's office from discriminatory policing and the judge ruled that more remedies could be ordered in the future. Sideshows: when he's not rounding up Latinos, Arpaio keeps the media interested by forcing jail inmates to wear pink underwear and live in outdoor tents . The group also accused the sheriff of ordering some immigration patrols not based on reports of crime but rather on letters and emails from Arizonans who complained about people with dark skin congregating in an area or speaking Spanish. The group's attorneys noted Arpaio sent thank-you notes to some who wrote the complaints.The sheriff said his deputies only stop people when they think a crime has been committed and that he wasn't the person who picked the location of the patrols. His lawyers said there was nothing wrong with the thank-you notes.Young, the group's lawyer, said he was still reading the decision Friday but noted it contained ""very detailed findings of discriminatory intent and effect.""Casey said that MCSO's position 'is that it has never used race and will never use race in its law-enforcement decisions.' He added the sheriff's office relied on 'bad training' from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.A call to ICE officials in Phoenix for comment wasn't immediately returned Friday evening.Arpaio, who turns 81 next month, was elected in November to his sixth consecutive term as sheriff in Arizona's most populous county.Known for his self-aggrandizing sideshows like jailing inmates in tents and making prisoners wear pink underwear, Arpaio started doing immigration enforcement in 2006 amid Arizona voter frustration with the state's role as the nation's busiest illegal entryway. Stats don't lie: Immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 'crime suppression' sweeps conducted by Arpaio's office since January 2008 . Snow wrote that 'in the absence of further facts that would give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause that a violation of either federal criminal law or applicable state law is occurring,' Arpaio's office now is enjoined from enforcing its policy 'on checking the immigration status of people detained without state charges, using Hispanic ancestry or race as any factor in making law enforcement decisions pertaining to whether a person is authorized to be in the country, and unconstitutionally lengthening stops.'Snow added 'the evidence introduced at trial establishes that, in the past, the MCSO has aggressively protected its right to engage in immigration and immigration-related enforcement operations even when it had no accurate legal basis for doing so.'The trial that ended Aug. 2 focused on Latinos who were stopped during both routine traffic patrols and special immigration patrols known as 'sweeps.'During the sweeps, deputies flood an area of a city - in some cases, heavily Latino areas - over several days to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders. Immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 sweeps conducted by his office since January 2008, according to figures provided by Arpaio's office.At trial, plaintiffs' lawyers drew testimony from witnesses who broke down in tears as they described encounters with authorities, saying they were pulled over because they were Hispanic and officers wanted to check their immigration status, not because they had committed an infraction. The sheriff's attorneys disputed such characterizations, typically working to show that officers had probable cause to stop the drivers based on a traffic violation. Victory: critics have been saying Arpaio profiles Latinos for nearly two decades. Now it's official . Plaintiffs' lawyers also presented statistics to show Latinos are more likely to be stopped on days of immigration patrols and showed emails containing offensive jokes about people of Mexican heritage that were circulated among sheriff's department employees, including a supervisor in Arpaio's immigrant smuggling squad.Defense lawyers disputed the statistical findings and said officers who circulated offensive jokes were disciplined. They also denied the complaint letters prompted patrols with a discriminatory motive.The ruling used Arpaio's own words in interviews, news conferences and press releases against him as he trumpeted his efforts in cracking down on immigrants. When it came to making traffic stops, Arpaio said in 2007 that deputies are not bound by state laws in finding a reason to stop immigrants.'Ours is an operation, whether it's the state law or the federal, to go after illegals, not the crime first, that they happen to be illegals,' the ruling quoted Arpaio as saying. 'My program, my philosophy is a pure program. You go after illegals. I'm not afraid to say that. And you go after them and you lock them up.'Some immigrant traffic stops were made 'purely on the observation of the undercover officers that the vehicles had picked up Hispanic day laborers from sites where Latino day laborers were known to gather,' the ruling said.The judge also said the sheriff's office declared on many occasions that racial profiling is strictly prohibited and not tolerated, while witnesses said it was appropriate to consider race as a factor in rounding up immigrants.'This is a blow to' the sheriff's office, said David A. Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studied racial profiling and wrote a book on the subject.Arpaio's lawyers will have 'an uphill climb' in the appeals process because of all 'the gross statistical evidence,' he said.","A federal judge ruled today that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office racially profiles Latinos, a claim that has been made by critics for more than a decade .

President Robert Mugabe may remain in power for a further ten years after signing a new constitution . President Robert Mugabe may be able to extend his 33-year-old rule over Zimbabwe for another ten years after signing a new constitution today. The law, which was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum in March, clips the powers of the president and imposes a two-term limit. However, it does not apply retroactively . so the 89-year-old Mugabe could technically extend his three decades in . office by another ten years. The constitution replaces a document forged in the dying days of white minority rule and paves the way for an election later this year. A beaming Mugabe, flanked by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, his main political rival, and Deputy President Joice Mujuru signed multiple copies of the charter at State House in the capital Harare to cheers and applause from aides. The constitution was formed as part of a power-sharing deal between Mugabe and Tsvangirai after disputed and violent elections in 2008. The five-year coalition government formed under the same agreement expires on June 29, and parliamentary. Mugabe has vowed to hold fair and open elections and a presidential vote could be held as early as August 14. Zimbabwe is hosting a worldwide United Nations tourism summit in . mid-August, suggesting that nationwide polls would take place in . September after what is expected to be the world's largest tourism . exposition. President Robert Mugabe has vowed that clean and fair elections will be held after allegations of vote rigging in the previous elections in 2008 when he beat rival Morgan Tsvangirai, right . However, many obstacles remain, . including finding the estimated $130million needed to pay for the . election and reaching agreement on outside monitors. Harare has turned down offers of United Nations or donor assistance. Mugabe said: 'This is a happening of joy, great joy indeed,' according to Sky News. He said today that the new . constitution shows that Zimbabweans are united, regardless of political . affiliation and without outside interference. Mugabe accused some in the 15-nation . Southern African Development Community (SADC), which has been mediating . in the crisis, of trying to impose their will on Harare. 'We rejected this,' he told reporters after the signing ceremony, adding that any vote would be fair and peaceful. 'We will ensure that there won't be any violence, that there won't be any rigging.' Robert Mugabe, pictured in 1978, was named Zimbabwe prime minister two years later after peace talks following the dissolution of white-minority rule . Mugabe, pictured with Margaret Thatcher, left, and Queen Elizabeth, right, was voted into power in 1980 . In brief remarks, Tsvangirai said the . charter had set the southern African country 'on a new path' after . nearly a decade of economic decline and political violence that started . in 2000 with the seizure of white-owned commercial farms by Mugabe . supporters. He said: 'As Zimbabweans we are proud that we are setting on a journey that is based on a new governance system.' They did not take questions from reporters. State media said today that Mugabe was pressing for a vote before July. His rivals want it delayed to allow for the opening up of broadcast media, registration of new voters and reform of the military to ensure it stays out of politics. Several parts of the new constitution are effective immediately with . others set to come into force after the swearing in of the next elected . administration. Mugabe was voted into power in 1980 after the British brokered peace talks in London following a civil war that saw the end of white minority rule. The pro-independence leader Mugabe and his Zanu party win the elections.

The woman are said to have enticed the men to have sex, then threatened to report the encounter to police as rape if they failed to pay substantial sums as part of the 'honeypot' operation (file picture) Police in South Korea say they have cracked a 'honeypot' operation where female gang members would have sex with married men then blackmail them. In each case, the women are said to have enticed the men to have sex, then threatened to report the encounter to police as rape if they failed to pay substantial sums. Police in Chungcheong Province arrested five people on Monday who are accused of extorting around £25,000 from three victims. In one case, on New Year’s Eve, Mr. Lim, 31, was having a drink with a friend when some women joined them at their table. Mr. Lim went to a motel with a woman by the name of Ms. Jeon. It is alleged she ended up accusing Mr. Lim of rape, demanding £3,500 in compensation which he paid. She then demanded a further £60,000 saying ‘if you don’t pay, I’m going to call the police’, investigators say. Mr. Lim suffered a brain hemorrhage on January 13 and is said to remain in an unconscious condition. However, a police report revealed that the woman who slept with Mr. Lim was part of a criminal gang’s ‘honeypot’ operation. They have arrested five individuals on suspicion of using sex to lure victims and steal their valuables. Among those arrested for theft and making threats were three women, all of whom have since been released. Police say that the gang is suspected of stealing £25,000 from three separate victims during a one month period last December. All of the victims of the ‘honeypot gang’ were either friends or acquaintances of the suspects. The gang even went so far as to report one of the three victims, 58-year-old Mr. Jeong, to the police for rape after he failed to pay the demanded £40,000. In one case a man was approached by a woman who was part of a criminal gang's 'honeypot' operation while he was having a drink with a friend on New Year's Eve (file picture) The police report also mentioned how the gang planned ahead for cases where they would actually accuse the victim of rape, using disposable cell phones with which they wouldn’t contact their accomplices. After obtaining confessions from the gang about their threats to the three victims, the police have begun examining similar cases from the same period. ‘We have heard about other honeypot operations run by gangs in the area, so we are expanding our investigation,’ said a representative from the North Chungcheon Province Police Department, ‘since targets of this crime can suffer greatly, even losing their families, we advise extreme caution.’","Women accused of seducing victims then extorting them for money .

The two passengers who died in an Angel Flight crash in upstate New York were a Vietnam veteran with brain cancer and his wife, a volunteer pilot said Sunday. Authorities investigating the crash of the twin-engine aircraft that went down Friday evening in Ephratah, a small town about an hour west of Albany, returned to the site Sunday to scour the woods and a nearby pond for the missing pilot. Terence Kindlon, an Albany attorney who is a volunteer pilot for Angel Flight, said he and another lawyer, Dale Thuillez, had flown the cancer patient and his wife to Boston on Friday morning in Thuillez's plane. Kindlon, 66, said the husband was being treated for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. He said they seemed like a happy pair. Short flight:The plane was headed for Rome, NY, and the crash occurred about 60 miles east of its intended destination . 'We were both former Marines and had been in Vietnam pretty close together in time,' Kindlon said. 'We hit it right off. He was a nice guy.' The two lawyers flew back to Albany in Thuillez's plane after dropping off the couple in Boston. Kindlon did not name the couple since authorities have yet to reveal their identities. Their bodies were found Friday near the crash site, Fulton County Sheriff Thomas Lorey said. National Transportation Safety Board investigators that returned to the crash site today aim to retrieve the bulk of the wreckage from the water over the next few days, said agency spokesman Eric Weiss. They are looking for smartphones, GPS devices, computer tablets or other items that could 'give the investigators some electronic evidence of what happened in the last minutes of flight,' he said. Wreckage from the crash was dispersed over a large area, with pieces of the plane found as far as five miles away. Plans called for rescue workers to canvass the woods and divers to use sonar to search a big, murky pond where the bulk of the aircraft was submerged. Town Supervisor Todd Bradt has said divers had trouble seeing in the water because it's so muddy, but a piece of the plane was removed earlier. Angel Flight is a nonprofit group that arranges free air transportation for sick patients from volunteer pilots. Larry Camerlin, president and founder of Angel Flight Northeast, said the organization was 'tremendously saddened' by news of the crash. Small plane: A Piper PA 34 was being used by the Angel Flight organization, a non-profit that sets up free air transportation for children and adults who need to travel to receive medical treatment . While the cause of the crash remains under investigation, Kindlon stressed that 'the standards for being an Angel Flight pilot are rigorous.' The Piper PA 34 had departed from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts, and was headed to Rome, New York, before it crashed just after 5 p.m. Friday, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said. The plane did not issue a distress call before losing radar and radio contact, the NTSB said. Visibility at the time in Rome was 10 miles, said National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Montgomery. It was slightly raining with winds of 13 to 14 mph. Witnesses described the destruction that started in the air above Ephratah, a sleepy town of about 700 people. The parking lot of Granny's Ice Cream Shanty, which is less than a mile from the crash site, was filled with emergency vehicles Saturday morning. Owner Joan Dudley said she and her employees were among the first at the scene Friday night. 'We were just leaving to get something to eat, and we heard this noise,' Dudley said. 'We looked up and saw the plane flipping in the air. Then it fell apart,' she said. 'Parts and pieces of it were flying through the sky, and a body fell out.' They called 911 as they parked their car and ran to the crash site in the rain to see if they could rescue anyone. Ephratah resident Roger Berry, 75, said he was outside chopping wood when the plane crashed. 'When I heard it, I knew something was wrong,' Berry said. 'It made one circle and came back around.' Searching: Rescue workers gather in the car park of Granny's Ice Cream Shanty near the site of the plane crash in Ephratah, New York . Berry said he heard a bang, then saw pieces of the plane fall from the sky and scatter. The motor fell 50 feet from his neighbor's bedroom, where she was sleeping, Berry said. Angel Flight Northeast said it has set up free air transportation and medical care for more than 65,000 children and adults on about 60,000 flights covering more than 12 million miles. It was founded in 1996. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating what might have caused the crash. 'We all offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of those affected,' Camerlin said in a statement. 'Our volunteer pilots are the most compassionate and generous individuals who donate their time, aircraft and fuel to transport patients and loved ones for free to essential medical care that would otherwise not be readily available to them. There are no words that can adequately express our sorrow.'","A brain cancer patient and Vietnam veteran and his wife have been revealed as the passengers in the flight that crashed over New York state on Friday .

There are no records of him ever having been charged in relation to the alleged drug sale. The article, that cited 10 anonymous sources, also claimed his brother Randy had been charged in a drug-related kidnapping. Additionally Ford's sister was named as having connections to the KKK and having been involved in drug related violence. Ford's brother Doug called the newspaper 'little sleaze bags' and 'a bunch of scums' for going after the family. 'I think it's pretty low, and a bunch of sleazy, sleazy journalism. It has gone to the bottom of the barrel … it makes me sick,' he told a Global News reporter.

European Tour CEO George O'Grady said that 'most of Sergio's friends are coloured athletes in the United States.' But speaking after he made the offensive remarks, he said: I deeply regret using an inappropriate word in a live interview for Sky Sports for which I unreservedly apologise,' O'Grady, who is British, said in a statement released later Thursday. Woods and Garcia been locked in a bitter exchange of words over the past two weeks dating to the third round of The Players Championship when Garcia implied that Woods purposely stirred up the gallery as the Spaniard was playing a shot. But the situation turned nasty when Garcia and his Ryder Cup teammates were at a dinner. The emcee, Golf Channel's Steve Sands, jokingly asked Garcia if he would have Woods over for dinner during the U.S. Open. 'We'll have him round every night,' Garcia replied. 'We will serve fried chicken.' The remark was reminiscent of Fuzzy Zoeller's similar comment about Woods during his record-setting victory in the 1997 Masters, when Woods became the first player of black heritage to win a major. Garcia initially released an apologetic statement and followed it up Wednesday at a news conference from the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, site of the European Tour's flagship event.

Sophie Dalzell, 19, refused to wear an ankle tag as she claimed it would interfere with her work as a soft porn model . An adult TV star convicted of vandalism was let off from wearing an electronic tag on her ankle – because it would ruin her on-screen work. Sophie Dalzell, 19, was placed on a curfew and ordered to wear a tag for eight weeks after failing to carry out community service. But when security firm G4S turned up to fit the tag she refused to let them put it on. She told them ‘appearance is everything’ on adult TV – and that she would be sacked if she turned up to work with a plastic tag on her ankle. Incredibly, when the presenter was hauled back to court, she successfully appealed against having the tag fitted after explaining it would compromise her career. Instead magistrates fined the glamour model £200 with £75 costs after she admitted breaching a community order. After the case the model, who has appeared topless in men’s magazines, said: ‘A tag on my ankle wouldn’t look very good. It’s an eyesore. Your appearance is everything. I’m still mad about the whole situation.’ Dalzell, of Manchester, added: ‘If I’d let them put the tag on, I’d have had no job and nowhere to live. I was doing adult channels, TV presenting. ‘I still don’t think it’s fair about the fine. I now want to get on with my life.’ Magistrates were told she no longer works in adult TV and has moved into modelling, photo shoots, hosting and other presenting jobs. Ms Dalzell  was ordered to wear the ankle tag after she failed to complete a 100 hour community service order . She was first hauled before the courts . in March last year after she became involved in a row outside 5th . Avenue nightclub in Manchester. During a dispute with the male driver of . a BMW car, she slapped him in the face and kicked his car causing . damage. As well as ordering her to pay £150 . compensation, magistrates gave her a probation order and sentenced her . to do 100 hours of unpaid work in the community. But she breached the order by not . carrying out all the hours and on December 13, G4S staff turned up at . her flat with the tag. Matthew Wallace, defending, said: ‘The problem . was that at that time Miss Dalzell had a contract with an agency for TV . glamour modelling. She couldn’t do that with the tag on her ankle.’ Ms Dalzell claimed that the £200 fine was unfair and said she was 'mad' about the siituation .

But she changed her plea to guilty . after telling the court a future trial date would conflict with a . modelling assignment she had in Ibiza.

Professor David Eastwood, vice-chancellor of Birmingham University, accepted a £29,000 bonus last year on top of his £323,000 salary and £67,000 in pension and other benefits. Accounts show the 53-year-old’s total pay for 2010/11, which includes the £16,000 running costs of his grace-and-favour university residence, was 7 per cent up on the previous year. Fatcat: Professor David Eastwood who earned almost £420,000 in the last academic year . His basic pay is £73,000 higher than his predecessor’s just five years before – an inflation-busting 29 per cent rise. It comes as the university is preparing to treble tuition fees to £9,000-a-year and follows a Government warning to limit vice-chancellors’ pay. Yet while some university heads took pay . cuts last year, 56 enjoyed salary rises, with 13 accepting increases of . more than 5 per cent. Average pay for university heads last year was £239,000, while the highest-paid was Professor Andrew Hamilton, vice-chancellor of Oxford, on £424,000, just ahead of Professor Eastwood’s £419,000. Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students, called the pay rises ‘outrageous’. He said: ‘Increasing your own wage while simultaneously making the case for students to pay fees is at best politically naive and at worst a huge insult to students.’ Mark Harrop, head of the Birmingham Guild of Students, said: ‘We feel the university should pay closer attention to economic sensitivities when deciding the vice-chancellor and senior management’s pay, especially when average staff salary increases were well below inflation.’ Big grin: Professor Andrew Hamilton, the Oxford University VC, pocketed £424,000 last year . A spokesman for Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘Ministers have called on universities to demonstrate pay restraint and expect that the lead on this should come from the very top.’ Professor Eastwood, an Oxford graduate who is married with three children, previously led the university funding quango, the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The university said that he had requested a salary freeze last year and that the increase in his pay packet was partly down to him having waived half his bonus the previous year. Ed Smith, Birmingham’s pro-chancellor, said: ‘Professor David Eastwood is the highly experienced head of a complex and successful organisation with a global reach. The university is a very significant enterprise with around 28,000 students, 6,000 staff and a turnover of over £460million.’","Highest paid university boss is Andrew Hamilton at Oxford University who earned £424,000 .

A British seed company has purchased a single pumpkin pip that comes from the biggest specimen ever grown after beating off fierce competition from around the world. Seed supplier Thompson and Morgan paid £170 for the inch-long seed on an online auction - about 400 times higher than what is normally paid by specialist growers for giant pumpkin seeds. Bosses at the seed company hope that because the pip comes from 'good stock' it will also produce record-breaking offspring. Heavyweight: Seed supplier Thompson and Morgan paid £170 for the inch-long seed from American grower Ron Wallace who holds the world record for growing the largest pumpkin (pictured) Giant: The valuable seed (pictured) is approximately three times bigger than an average pumpkin seed . The seed was sold by American pumpkin grower Ron Wallace who last year claimed a world record for his enormous pumpkin that weighed 2,009lbs. Suffolk-based Thompson and Morgan saw off 67 rival bids and paid over the odds for the seed because it hopes to use it to grow an even bigger pumpkin. The record-breaking pip is now being sent by air-mail to the UK from Mr Wallace's home in Rhode Island. Thompson and Morgan are currently speaking with a number of British growers before choosing one they will work with on the pumpkin project. Paul Hansord, managing director of Thompson and Morgan, said: 'If you want to grow a really huge pumpkin you need to start with record-breaking, genetically proven, premium seed. Record: The pip is taken from Mr Wallace's record-breaking pumpkin that weighed 2,009lbs . 'The price for a giant pumpkin seed is usually around 46p so this seems quite extortionate compared to that but we are paying for the pedigree. It was a frenzied bidding war but we are happy we managed to clinch it.' Bidding on the European Giant Vegetable Grower's Association auction lasted for four hours. The average pumpkin has around 350 seeds and the size of the individual fruit has no bearing on how many it has inside. Michael Perry, new product development manager at Thompson and Morgan, said they had big hopes for their seed. He said: 'The seed is about three times the size as your average pumpkin seed and obviously it has a good pedigree and comes from good stock. Winning bid: Suffolk-based Thompson and Morgan saw off 67 rival bids and paid over the odds for the seed because it hopes to use it to grow an even bigger pumpkin . 'The hybridisation has already been formed in the seed so it will be ready to grow. We are hoping to look for a grower who will work with us, probably off-site, to beat the world record. 'It will need lots of space, lots of heat, lots of water and lots feed, lots of everything really. But we are going to give it every chance to become a record.' If successful, Thompson and Morgan hope to mass-produce seeds from the pumpkin which they will then sell.

The Horace Mann School, one of New York City's most prestigious private schools, has apologized for more than three decades of sexual abuse perpetrated by some of its teachers and administrators, according to a letter posted on its website on Friday. 'We sincerely apologize for the harm that was caused by the teachers and administrators who abused anyone during their years at Horace Mann School,' wrote Board Chairman Steven Friedman and Head of School Thomas Kelly in the three-page letter. 'These unconscionable betrayals of trust never should have happened.' The Bronx district attorney's office and the New York Police Department launched an investigation into allegations of abuse at the school after a New York Times Magazine article last summer that said the academy was plagued by teachers who sexually abused children in the 1970s. Horace Mann: The school made a public apology for decades of sexual abuse . Public letter: The school has been heavily criticized for its near silence on the issue up to now . Friday's letter apologizes for abuse by former teachers and administrators between 1962 and 1996. In March, Horace Mann reached settlements 'worth hundreds of thousands of dollars' with around 27 alumni who said they were abused, though the school didn't comment on the payouts at the time. In April, prosecutors said that while there was a systemic pattern of suspected sexual abuse at the Bronx school, however, those people could not be prosecuted because the statue of limitations on the crimes has passed. In the letter Friday, Friedman and Kelly said the school had hired a private mediation firm which presented the board of trustees with impact statements from 31 individuals who described their abuse. They said settlements have been reached with 'the great majority' of those individuals. The apology will hopefully grant some . solace to the hundreds of former students who, prompted by the initial . Times story, came forward online and elsewhere in the press to share . their own disturbing tales of abuse. Out of court: The school has reached settlements with roughly 27 of the 32 victims worth hundreds of thousands of dollars . The . letter promised to effectively remove board of trustee members who . served when the allegations were ignored and announced the creation of a . new student safety policy and advisory board. Still, it did not offer one of the victims' chief demands: an independent inquiry into the over 30-year period of abuse. Attorney .

A six-year-old girl, whose father and stepmother were arrested and jailed last year for chaining her to a dresser, was found dead early on Tuesday morning. Authorities found the body of Jersey Bridgeman, from Arkansas, in a vacant house approximately 10 minutes after she was reported missing. She had just turned six years old last week. So far, investigators are ruling her death as a homicide but have yet to say how exactly the girl died or release any names of suspects. With the investigation already in its second day, officers have conducted searches of three homes, including the girl’s, the building where she was found and a nearby trailer. Through the process, they have collected about 50 pieces of evidence, which they are currently examining. Meanwhile, Bridgeman's body has been sent to the state crime lab in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the results of an autopsy are pending. Police are also patrolling the area and have kept officers watching Bridgeman's home and the home where her body was found. The FBI has been . brought in to assist in the investigation. Meanwhile, it is still unclear where Jersey's biological mother, DesaRae, was at the time of the missing persons call. Bentonville Police Department said that certain details of the case were being withheld 'to maintain the integrity of the investigation'.

Questions: Police have yet to release a cause of death or a list of suspects and are still attempting to find the whereabouts of Bridgeman's mother and caretaker. Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving. Behind Bars: Bridgeman's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chain the girl to a dresser as punishment. 'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.' The woman who first contacted the police . about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a . silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar. Bridgeman's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house. 'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead. 'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added. Both Bridgeman's father and stepmother pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. For their crime, the father is serving an 18-year prison sentence, while the stepmother was sentenced to 12 years. Tragic: Jersey pictured with her biological mother DesaRae Bridgeman. It is not clear where she was when Jersey was reported missing . Shaken: More than 100 people gathered Tuesday to hold a candlelight vigil for Bridgeman. Remembered: The six-year-old was well loved in her community and many describing her as being special. The ongoing drama surrounding Bridgeman's death has left her community shaken. The local school district is currently working on ways to address the death and help students cope with the loss. Administrators said they hope to have finalized plan ready by the time classes resume on Monday. Meanwhile, Brad Brown, a neighbor, told the local ABC affiliate that he is now concerned about his and his loved ones' safety. 'You . get worried because it's in your backyard, you know,' he said.

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 10:10 EST, 8 February 2012 . A system for keeping an eye on potentially dangerous 'artificial life' laboratories around the world is essential, say leading experts. The Woodrow Wilson Centre, in Washington, US, warns that there is no way of monitoring labs tinkering with 'synthetic biology' to ensure that anything created is safe. The field 'synthetic biology' came into being in 2010 when a scientist added synthetic DNA to a bacteria cell to create a 'new' life form. An Oxford ethicist warned that it opened the door to 'the most powerful bioweapons imaginable'. The Centre's Synthetic Biology project has recommended a 'score card' to ensure laboratories adhere to guidelines laid down by a Presidential Commisision in 2010. Billionaire entrepreneur Dr Craig Venter-a controversial figure known as 'Darth Venter' to his colleagues- created a life form two years ago . President Obama was presented with a report from the Commission's 13 scientists in 2010, after billionaire entrepreneur Craig Venter created the world's first artificial life form. Since then, the field has changed. Worryingly, enthusiasts calling themselves 'biohackers' - and calling the field DIYBio - have begun experimenting with their own 'synthetic biology' projects, such as MIT graduate Kay Aull's reprogramming of E Coli's genome. Free 'Genspace' biology labs have opened in New York, Boston and San Francisco, where scientists are provided with equipment to run their own experiments without regulation. 'As the field progresses, the government should continue to assess specific security and safety risks of synthetic biology research in settings including the 'do-it-yourself' community,' the report advised. Valerie Bonham, executive director of the . Commission, said, 'In the . report, the members emphasized the need for transparency, dialogue, and . accountability around synthetic biology.'

Professor Julian Savulescu, an Oxford University ethicist, said of Venter's discovery: . 'Venter is creaking open the most profound door in humanity's history, . potentially peeking into its destiny.This could be used in the future to . make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable. The challenge is to eat . the fruit without the worm.' Could 'artificial life' pose a threat to humanity? 'The Commission's report was a . landmark document and lays out a framework, but, like many reports of this type, no . mechanisms were put in place to track progress,' David Rejeski, director . of the Wilson Centre's Synthetic Biology Project, said. 'Our goal is ensure that this . report -- and others like it – can drive change.' The centre recommends a web-based 'score card' to highlight rogue synthetic biology projects. 'The Scorecard, unveiled today, monitors the progress made toward implementing the recommendations in the report from the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.' The report contains 18 recommendations covering a range of topics from risk assessment to ethics education and public engagement.'","Labs need to be monitored, says American institute .

Theresa May is emerging as a ‘Stop Boris’ candidate for the Tory leadership if the party fails to win the next election. Allies insisted she would do nothing to undermine David Cameron during this Parliament.However, they conceded she could be the leading candidate to prevent London Mayor Boris Johnson winning a future contest, should the Tories not win the next election and Mr Cameron steps down. The steely Home Secretary – dubbed ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by supporters – looked livid yesterday as Ed Miliband mentioned mounting speculation about her leadership ambitions at Prime Minister’s Questions. Scroll down for video . Unamused: Home Secretary Theresa May sits stony-faced as Ed Miliband teases her about becoming Tory leader in opposition. She was sat next to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who has been tipped as her Chancellor . It has been suggested that Mrs May . could exploit an emerging alliance with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . to run on a ‘Top Gear ticket’ of ‘May and Hammond’, named after the . presenters of the BBC show. Both are resisting further cuts in their departments as Chancellor George Osborne embarks on a new spending review. Increasing numbers of women Tory MPs . are backing the Home Secretary as a potential leader, as are some . Right-wing men impressed with her command of the Home Office, . traditionally a political graveyard. The Spectator magazine has named . former Cabinet ministers Cheryl Gillan and Caroline Spelman, education . minister Edward Timpson and parliamentary aide George Hollingbery as . among those helping to position her for a future campaign. Speculation in Westminster has been . heightened after Mrs May started inviting MPs to open ‘tearoom . surgeries’ each Wednesday after Prime Minister’s Questions. During PMQs Labour leader Ed Miliband turned his attention to Mrs May, who was sat on the government frontbench, and her ambitions to replace David Cameron . Theresa May was born on October 1, 1956, in . Eastbourne, Sussex. Her father was a Church of England clergyman. Before attending a grammar school, she was . educated at a state primary, independent convent and state secondary . schools. On completion of her studies at school, she attended the University of Oxford where she read Geography. Before entering national politics, she worked at the Bank of England and also as a financial consultant. She . was also a London councillor. May was first elected to Parliament in 1997 as an MP for Maidenhead. Before becoming a senior minister, she served in a variety of roles in the Shadow Cabinets of Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and also current Prime Minister David Cameron. During her time on the opposition benches, she was Shadow Leader of the House of Commons and Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Following Cameron's appointment as Prime Minister in May 2010, she was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities. However, she gave up the latter role in 2012. ‘Theresa is quietly showing the rest . of them how it’s done,’ one minister said. ‘She’s got immigration and . crime down, pushed through the most radical police reform for a . generation with barely a ripple, her command of detail is Thatcherite . and she has shown real bravery on issues like [the extradition of . computer hacker] Gary McKinnon. Dismiss her at your peril.’ However, another MP said of the . prospect of a ‘dream ticket’ of Mrs May and Mr Hammond: ‘They are both . brilliant but you might say anything approaching a light touch is . lacking.’ Allies insisted Mrs May, who flirted . with a leadership run in 2005, was unhappy at the focus on her ambitions . and said the idea that she was plotting against Mr Cameron in any way . was ‘ridiculous’. ‘She and David Cameron get on . enormously well,’ said one supporter. ‘She has complete faith in him and . he has complete faith in her. David Cameron is not going anywhere and . anyone who thinks so is mad. ‘But she is not a great fan of Boris. She thinks he is a faintly ridiculous figure who changes his mind every . five minutes.

An employee at a media agency in London has decided to send a leaving speech detailing his grievances with a company manager to all members of staff. And worse still - that email has now gone viral after it was posted online, with its hashtag trending on Twitter. Damning: The email from disgruntled employee Kieran Allen provides reasons as to why he has decided to leave his job at London-based media agency MEC Global. Parts are censored for legal reasons . The phrase - coined by Twitter users - refers to the worker's boss at the UK media agency MEC Global, whose name we have withheld for legal reasons. Employee Kieran Allen, a senior account manager at the company, has lambasted his manager for ruining the past 8 months of his working life. Mr Allen has decided to quit the company after 2 and a half years of 'loyal service' because he alleges the manager blocked his bonus, gave him a verbal warning for poor performance and put him on a performance review, according to the email that was sent yesterday morning. This, Mr Allen says, was after he was persuaded to stay with the company with the promise of a substantial pay-rise and rapid development. But following the promotion he suffered a break down from stress after being overloaded with work and had to take two weeks off work. It was only after his return in March that he says the manager 'instead of welcoming me back and looking to make things right, instead attacked me and made me feel an outsider. 'I was made to feel that I had actually done wrong'. The hashtag started trending on Twitter after the email was uploaded by someone on the internet . In the email Mr Allen also alleges the manager has jokingly referred to the Paralympics as the 'Spastic Olympics' and openly claimed to be proud 'not to have a drop of Jewish blood in him'. He claims he 'regularly made sexist and other bigoted remarks' and 'took a female colleague out for a drink on the day he interviewed her, then later took her back to the MEC offices that night and had sexual relations with her in the meeting rooms on the 3rd floor'. He said the allegations were 'common knowledge throughout the team' and said 'it is hard to fathom that such a man is responsible for the work well-being of over 30 staff'. Before signing off the message he wrote, 'I am writing this message in order to expose the failings and protect others in future' and 'I am a good human being who treats people with respect.' 'Not one thing on this email has been exaggerated or made up. This is my truth to you all. 'No doubt I fully expect the above to be ripped apart but as long as the truth is out there then that’s all I can do.' A spokesman for MEC told MailOnline: 'We are sad that one of our employees has chosen to share their personal views in such a public way and has left the company with such bad feeling. 'We are taking this issue seriously though given the highly personal nature of the email, we cannot comment further.' The alleged response by management to the email sent to members of staff, posted on a website . According to a post on website Pastebin, management allegedly sent an email to staff after Mr Allen sent his email saying: 'By now, I expect you will have read . the email sent to the company from Kieran Allan, and I am sure that once . the surprise has subsided, you are probably left with the same feeling . of sadness that I have.

The parents of a 15-year-old girl who committed suicide after relentless bullying successfully sued the school district for $225,000, it has emerged. Irish immigrant Phoebe Prince was taunted by classmates in South Hadley, Massachusetts, after she dated a boy. She killed herself in January 2010. The large settlement was reached more than a year ago but a journalist has only just won a court order for the release of the information. Suicide: Classmates taunted Irish immigrant Phoebe Prince in South Hadley, Massachusetts, after she dated a popular boy and she hanged herself last year . ‘This is a victory for the public's right to know and for transparency in government,’ said ACLU civil rights lawyer Bill Newman in Massachusetts. The state American Civil Liberties Union had represented Slate reporter Emily Bazelon in her bid for the disclosure of the settlement. Phoebe’s parents filed a lawsuit against the South Hadley Public School District in July 2010 and a settlement was reached in November 2010. Jeremy Prince and Anne O’Brien settled claims against the town and school department, saying they would release them from further claims. Phoebe moved to the U.S. from Ireland in 2009 and briefly dated Sean Mulveyhill, a popular boy at the school aged 17 at the time. She was almost immediately met with a bullying campaign which included slurs about her Irish heritage and insults on Facebook. Community service: Phoebe moved to the U.S. from Ireland in 2009 and briefly dated Sean Mulveyhill, left, whose ex-girlfriend Kayla Narey, right, bullied her . They broke up and later Sean’s ex-girlfriend Kayla Narey and her friends bullied Phoebe. Sean and Kayla were sentenced to community service. 'This is a victory for the public's right to know and for transparency in government' Bill Newman . Five students in total accepted plea deals in criminal cases connected with bullying that preceded her death. None involved prison time. Phoebe’s death was one of several high-profile teen suicides that prompted new laws aimed at cracking down on bullying in schools. Her case gained global attention and all school districts in Massachusetts are now required to develop bullying prevention plans. Superior Court Judge Mary Lou-Rup ruled in favour of Slate reporter Ms Bazelon in an order dated December 23. Parents: Jeremy Prince and Anne O'Brien, pictured, settled claims against the town and school department, saying they would release them from further claims . Judge Lou-Rup said the town had not shown what harm would be caused by disclosure and the Prince family had not registered an objection. 'There is a dead weight that now sits permanently in my chest' Anne O’Brien . Town lawyer Edward Ryan argued that the settlement was not a public document and all parties involved had agreed to keep it confidential. 'There is a dead weight that now sits permanently in my chest,' Phoebe’s mother Mrs O’Brien said in a court statement back in May.

"By . Craig Mackenzie . UPDATED: . 11:05 EST, 3 December 2011 . Criticism: Jacques Delors the former president of the European Commission . A key architect of the euro has claimed it was flawed from the start and  efforts by European leaders to tackle its problems have so far been 'too little, too late'. Jacques Delors, the former president of the European Commission, said that ‘a fault in execution’ of the currency, rather than the concept itself, had led to the crisis. Mr Delors, 86, who led the commission from 1985 to 1995, played a central role in the process that led to the creation of the euro in 1999. But today he claimed political leaders had turned a blind eye to the weaknesses and imbalances of member states’ economies. In his first interview in a decade, he said: ‘The finance ministers did not want to see anything disagreeable which they would be forced to deal with.’ The Frenchman said all member states had played a part in the euro’s downfall and that ‘everyone must examine their consciences’. But he did single out Germany for insisting the European Central Bank must not support debt-stricken members for fear of fuelling inflation. The problems were fuelled by ‘a combination of the stubbornness of the Germanic idea of monetary control and the absence of a clear vision from all the other countries’. Crisis: One of the key architects of the single currency was Jacques Delors . Mr Delors famously clashed with Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s over his vision for a closer Europe. But now he admits that Britons, whom he referred to as Anglo-Saxons, may have been right to express concerns that a single central bank and currency without a single state would be unstable. Lord Lamont: Jacque Delors deserves 'credit' for his comment . ‘They had a point’, he said. His intervention, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, came as France and Germany edged towards closer fiscal union to head off a potentially disastrous collapse of the single currency. Mr Delors insisted that all European countries had to share the blame for excessive borrowing by countries such as Italy and Greece that have brought the system to the brink of disaster. Such is the scale of the crisis, he warned, that 'even Germany' will struggle to find a solution. 'Markets are markets. They are now bedevilled by uncertainty.' According to Mr Delors, the UK is 'just as embarrassed as the Europeans by the . financial crisis', as some of the measures put in place to deal with the . crisis pose a threat to British interests. Today former chancellor Lord Lamont, who negotiated Britain's opt-out from the single currency, said Mr Delors deserved 'credit' for his comments. He said: 'Jacques Delors' remarks are hugely significant, particularly his admission that those who said you cannot have a single currency without a single government 'had a point'. Talks: French President Nicolas Sarkozy and David Cameron discussed the eurozone crisis this week . 'All credit to Jacques Delors for finally admitting what so many people, including in Britain, denied.' Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted British interests will be paramount if the European Union treaty is changed to help resolve the eurozone crisis. He held talks in Paris yesterday with President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of next week's crunch EU summit. That gathering is expected to focus on discussions about whether fundamental treaty change will be needed to help deal with the crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted yesterday that such reforms were necessary and hailed recent steps towards creating a 'fiscal union'. She told the Bundestag that the eurozone crisis could not be solved in one fell swoop, urging long-term tighter fiscal integration. 'Resolving the sovereign debt crisis is a process and this process will take years,' she said. 'Marathon runners often say that the run becomes especially difficult at the 35 kilometre mark, but they also say that reaching the finish line is possible if you are conscious of the full challenge from the very start and approach it accordingly. 'The one who starts fastest isn't necessarily the most successful. It is the one who is aware of what is involved in running the full distance.' British diplomats fear the 17 euro members could seek an agreement on new rules between themselves, effectively excluding other EU countries.","Everyone must examine their consciences, says former architect of single currency .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 16:59 EST, 2 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:45 EST, 2 July 2012 . Under scrutiny: Baroness Vadera prepared a paper with former colleagues at the bank UBS headed 'Reducing Libor' Leaked documents last night brought the interest-rate fixing scandal that has shaken Britain's banks closer to the heart of the last Labour government. They suggest that Baroness Vadera, a former Cabinet Office minister and one of Labour's chief economic advisers, told officials in 2008 that bringing down the rates which determine how much banks lend to each other would be 'a major contribution to the stability of the banking system and to the health of the economy'. A paper prepared by the peer with former colleagues at the bank UBS was headed 'Reducing Libor' – the name for the inter-bank lending rate at the centre of the scandal. The document was circulated among officials and Lady Vadera's ministerial colleagues at the height of the credit crunch in 2008 and concludes: 'Getting Libor down is desirable.' But the briefing note was prepared only days after Barclays boss Bob Diamond, who is fighting to save his job after traders at the bank were revealed to have made millions by fixing the rate, discussed the issue with Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker. On another dramatic day in the unfolding scandal: . Denial: The Bank of England has been forced to deny it was aware that bankers were manipulating the rate . The Bank of England has been forced to deny it was aware that bankers were manipulating the rate, which affects how much customers pay for mortgages and credit cards. Barclays traders are said to have 'mistakenly' believed they were operating under instruction from the Bank when they fiddled the figures. Lady Vadera said last night there had been widespread concern, including in government, about Libor figures but insisted that was 'very different' to issues of alleged market manipulation. What discussions bank bosses had with officials from the Bank, and senior figures in government, over Libor will form a central part of a Senate-style inquiry announced last night by David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne. Labour leader Ed Miliband has insisted that only a full-scale public inquiry led by a senior judge will do, and is considering refusing to co-operate with the Parliamentary probe. Mr Miliband said politicians investigating bankers would not command the confidence of the British people. Lady Vadera's leaked note, from November 2008, suggests concern about reducing the rate was shared by senior figures in the Labour government, and specifically mentions the high rates being posted by Barclays, RBS and HBOS. The peer and her co-authors say the price of credit in the real economy is 'heavily Libor influenced' and that bringing the rate down was critical to 'rebuilding the health of a banking system'. Libor is the average cost of borrowing for banks, calculated every day using submissions from a number of selected banks. It is used to price huge numbers of loans and financial products across the world. Lady Vadera's note discusses reducing the fees on government lending schemes to banks as a way of trying to cut their borrowing costs, and there is no suggestion the peer was aware that traders went on to fiddle the rate. But the document adds to growing evidence of concern about keeping Libor low among the authorities of the day. The Parliamentary inquiry is likely to focus on how and whether that concern was communicated to bank bosses, and how they responded. Conservative MP Jesse Norman, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: 'This document appears to show that senior figures in the last government were highly concerned about ways of reducing Libor at the height of the financial crisis. The question is whether and how that was passed on to the banks. 'That issue, and the relationship between the Bank of England and Barclays, will need to be looked at closely by the Parliamentary inquiry.' Mr Osborne, in a Commons clash with Labour's Ed Balls, whose former ministerial duties included regulating the City, asked: 'Did he express any concerns about the Libor rate when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister? We will find out in due course.' Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, a former banker, said the revelations about Libor were likely to be the tip of the iceberg. She said: 'You know, if Libor has been manipulated, and abused, and lied about, what other potential areas of the inter-bank markets have been rigged? 'Gilt auctions, for example, other liquidity schemes that the Bank of England's put in place.

'I must admit, as a former banker and having kind of made the case for the industry over a while, I was pretty shocked at this new low.'

The boss of an energy giant that has doubled its prices in just seven years could pocket a £13million payoff. Phil Bentley, who is to leave British Gas within months, has presided over above-inflation hikes that have pushed average bills past £1,300 a year. The latest punishing rise of 6 per cent comes as millions endure the greatest squeeze on living standards since the 1920s. The boss of British Gas, Phil Bentley, could pocket a £13million payoff despite the company doubling its prices in just seven years . In stark contrast, 53-year-old Mr Bentley’s potential windfall would be enough to pay a typical family’s gas and electricity bill for 9,500 years. Figures from the watchdog Consumer Focus put the average bill at £735 in 2006 – a year before Mr Bentley became managing director. Today it is £1,353 – an increase of 84 per cent. Before the winter each of the Big Six energy providers – British Gas, EDF, SSE, Eon, Npower and Scottish Power – announced big hikes in power tariffs. Another rise of up to 5 per cent is expected this year, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility, the Government’s independent forecasting body. The increase – of around £70 – would push the average bill to £1,420 a year. Mr Bentley will leave British Gas later this year as part of a management overhaul, sources inside the group confirmed. It is thought he has fallen out with Sam Laidlaw – chief executive of parent company Centrica – over strategic direction. Insiders say Mr Bentley was being lined up as 57-year-old Mr Laidlaw’s successor and was keen on the job. But, with Mr Laidlaw unwilling to leave, Mr Bentley is said to have decided to pursue other options and will be given a ‘golden goodbye’. Analysis by the Daily Mail of Centrica’s annual report and details of share awards sent to investors over the past 12 months show he could walk away with £12.9million. Departure: Mr Bentley will leave British Gas later this year as part of a management overhaul, sources inside the group confirmed . As the boss of British Gas, which supplies 12million homes, he received a basic salary of £635,000 in 2011 – the most recent year for which figures are available. He also received perks worth £46,000 including a company car and private medical cover – as well as a discount of almost £700 from his own energy bill. In 2011 he was given a bonus in shares worth £399,000 that he will be able to cash in during 2014. When he leaves, it is widely expected he would receive 12 months of salary, as well as being granted access to the bonus shares. But the bulk of his payoff would come from numerous reward schemes that potentially entitle him to a further 2,489,081 shares. Most of the schemes mature over a three-year period and depend upon the company hitting its performance targets. If the remuneration committee decides to waive the normal conditions and hand Mr Bentley all of his outstanding shares, he would receive a pot worth some £8.3million at yesterday’s share price of 334p. They could do this as a gift of thanks for his service to the business, which he joined in 2000. However they may argue he is not entitled to the full amount because he is leaving the company early. Struggling: Mr Bentley's potential windfall would be enough to pay a typical family's gas and electricity bill for 9,500 years . The annual report shows he has a pension pot with a transfer value of £3.6million. The share awards, along with his salary and bonus and pension pot, amount to £12.9million. Centrica last night refused to comment on Mr Bentley’s payoff, or any details of his departure. Sources inside British Gas say Mr Bentley transformed the customer service department and pumped millions of pounds into its UK call centres. Last year British Gas received 5 stars from consumer groups Which? and Consumer Focus for customer satisfaction. But Tom Greatrex, a Labour energy spokesman, said: ‘British Gas customers, who have seen their bills soar on Phil Bentley’s watch, will be astonished at the level of his payoff. ‘When hard-pressed families are having their incomes squeezed it will strike many as an obscene level of reward. ‘British Gas should be focused on reducing prices for their customers not paying departing executives millions in bonuses.’ James Granger, of the Fuel Poverty Action group, said: ‘The £12.9million could be used to insulate thousands of homes and fund investment in the cheaper, cleaner renewable energy we need to bring bills down and tackle climate change.’","Phil Bentley is boss of British Gas which has doubled its prices in 7 years .

The footage, shot at Flemington Racecourse and posted by Gavin Caporn, features her throwing wild punches, collapsing on the floor and eventually being pinned down.

Five security guards eventually arrive to remove her. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The unidentified black-haired woman, who was wearing a tight blue dress, matching blue hairpiece and black heels, was caught on camera at the Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Australia . Undignified: The video, posted by a Gavin Caporn, showed the drunk woman stumbling around the grass without a security guard in sight, bumping into random people and falling over while shouting at the crowd . The footage is sure to provoke some . more heated debate after a Mail Online article showing Melbourne’s . finest running amok at the event went viral yesterday. A slew of newspapers and TV shows . featured the story with many appalled that the behaviour at Flemington . had attracted such bad international press. More than 70 racegoers were thrown out of the event after incidents involving alcohol. Out of those, 39 were forced to leave for being intoxicated, four people were arrested for being drunk in public place and 29 were caught trying to bring alcohol into the racecourse. Paramedics treated 23 racegoers mainly for alcohol-related problems. But as the drunken behaviour at the event became the focus of the international press, others were only too keen to highlight Britain’s own less than salubrious record at sporting events. Debauched scenes from recent race . meetings such Aintree and even Royal Ascot where a picture of a drunken . thug swigging a bottle of pink champagne horrified Mail Online readers. Crowd watches on: A clip emerged today of the female racegoer so drunk that she was flinging wild punches at anybody near her, falling over, exposing her underwear and eventually being hauled away by security . Going nowhere: She is pinned down by a man, while shouts of ‘Get this b***h out of here’ and ‘Where's security?’ are heard.

One Australian newspaper accused our ‘trashbag’ nation of ‘chaotic scenes’ and being a ‘frolicking mess’. ‘Back in the Old Dart, Royal Ascot's . finest must have been choking on their foie gras and desperately . pondering just how we let it come to this,’ Aaron Langmaid wrote in . Melbourne’s Herald Sun. ‘We have always done it differently . Down Under. We've learnt to excuse those regrettable back tattoos, white . leather shoes and bum-skimming skirts.

He said people must step over . ‘acid-tripping hippies’ at the Notting Hill Carnival and Boat Race fans . are seen ‘chugging down pints of Stella Artois and blabbering on about . the Premiership League’. The paper also lambasted Britain’s . ‘dramatically inconsistent take on public etiquette’ after scenes of . drunkenness when an alcohol ban was launched in 2008 on the London . Underground. In addition it wrote of ‘a shameful . wake of locals who stumbled out of stations, hitching up their dresses . and doing up their flies and wobbling off into the night’. Meanwhile news.com.au asked the . question: ‘The Melbourne Cup party stopped a nation, but is it the . British who don't know how to have fun?’ Social networks were abuzz with .

David Beckham has lost an appeal to sue an American magazine over false claims he slept with a prostitute, because they are protected by US freedom of speech laws. Bosnian Irma Nici had claimed she had sex with Beckham at Claridges Hotel in London but the 37-year-old star was able to show he was never at the hotel but at a hospital visiting his sick father Ted, who had suffered a heart attack. Beckham, who was playing for US football club LA Galaxy at the time denied ever meeting Nici and sued In Touch magazine, which now accepts the story was untrue, for $25million in an LA court. Rights: Prostitute Irma Nici claimed she slept with David Beckham at Claridges Hotel in London when the footballer was visiting his father in hospital . The case was initially thrown out by a Los Angeles judge in 2010 after he ruled the magazine article wasn't libelous and was in the public interest. But Beckham appealed. His legal team had alleged that the magazine, which is part of the German owned Bauer Group, failed to produce critical documents to back up Nici's claims she slept with Beckham. But this week the case was thrown out a second time after Judges at the Appeals Court in LA ruled the first ammendment to the US Constitution entitled Nici, 27, to free speech. Anger: David Beckham leaves training with current club Paris Saint-Germain last week . A spokesman for Beckham told the Daily Mirror: 'This story has been proven to be false, the magazine now accepts it to be fabricated. However we will continue to prove the magazine showed purposeful intent.' Becks is pursuing a separate claim against Nici who has not been seen or heard of for several months.","Bosnian Irma Nici claimed she had sex with Beckham at Claridges Hotel in London .

Girlguiding UK, the parent organisation which encompasses the Guides, Brownies and Rainbows, is considering dropping their oath to God and the Queen . 'We know from listening to our members that some people do find some parts of the oath challenging, and when members do make that oath we want them to mean it and believe it. 'Times do change, the world has changed and the way people view the world has changed. Our response is not to be stuck in a rigid way, but to respond to the needs of our membership.' She told the Guardian that this was 'in no way a watering down of our values or moral compass'. 'Some people could be uncomfortable with a change, others might be encouraged,' she added. The move follows a similar consultation by the Scout Association, which is also considering providing an alternative promise to welcome atheists as full members after complaints from parents and campaigners.

Struggling: One in five boys cannot write their own name (file picture) Almost one in five boys are struggling to write their own name at the age of five, figures suggest. Government statistics show a gender gap still remains, with girls outperforming boys in areas such as writing and counting before they start formal education. Some 19 per cent of boys cannot write their own name, or short words like 'dog' or 'cat', compared with one in 10 girls. And two fifths of boys cannot write a simple shopping list, or a letter to Santa, compared with a fifth of five-year-old girls. While almost one in 10 boys cannot count up to 10, compared with six per cent of girls. The worrying statistics, published by the Department for Education for 2011, show how many five-year-olds are achieving specific early learning 'goals', including social skills, literacy and numeracy and emotional development. Children's Minister Sarah Teather said: 'It's encouraging to see a small improvement from last year. This is a testament to the hard work of early years professionals. 'However, it is not good enough that more than two out of five children start school without the solid foundation they need to succeed and that boys continue to lag behind girls. 'That's why we are improving the Early Years Foundation Stage and radically slimming down the curriculum so that it is more focused on getting children ready and able to take advantage of the opportunities they will get at school. 'From next September we are cutting down the number of early learning goals children need to reach at age five, with a stronger focus on the key skills that they will need to thrive as they grow up.' Pledge to improve: David Cameron, centre, and Children's Minister Sarah Teather, left, launch an education website with children this month . The statistics reflect growing literacy problems emerging across the population in the UK. Earlier this month it emerged that hundreds of police sergeants are having to waste time correcting the poor English of frontline colleagues in reports. The officers work behind the scenes checking files for basic spelling and grammatical errors, as well as ensuring that all basic arithmetic is correct. As many as 500 'evidential review officers' - mostly sergeants on up to £43,000 a year - are employed by the Metropolitan Police alone.

Expensive: The police investigation into the Jimmy Savile, pictured, . abuse scandal has cost around £2 million . The police investigation into the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal has cost around £2 million so far, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner said today. Bernard Hogan-Howe gave a committee of MPs an estimated cost for Operation Yewtree, which involves a team of 30 officers. Scotland Yard is leading a national probe into alleged abuse by disgraced TV presenter Savile, as well as claims made against other figures in the entertainment industry. Earlier this month the force said it was dealing with around 450 potential victims, the vast majority of whom claimed they had fallen prey to Savile. Officers are looking at three strands within their inquiry: claims against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others. Most of the 'others' allegations have been made against people associated with the entertainment industry. So far Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De’Ath, have been arrested and bailed as part of the probe. Mr Hogan-Howe addressed the Commons Home Affairs Committee as his force is facing more than £500million in cuts. The Met is selling New Scotland Yard as part of the plans, and will see the loss of 1,200 officers ranked sergeant or above, as well as around 3,500 members of civilian of staff. Investigation: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, pictured, gave a committee of MPs an estimated cost for Operation Yewtree, which involves a team of 30 officers . The size of the bill was exposed as BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten also gave evidence to MPs that raised fresh concerns about the overall cost of the scandal. Lord Patten revealed that former BBC director general George Entwistle asked for even more than the controversial £450,000 pay-off when he left the corporation over two abuse crises. He told MPs that Mr Entwistle wanted more than 12 months' salary to resign - despite being contractually entitled to only half that amount. Appearing before the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Lord Patten insisted today the settlement was ""better than any other course of action"" amid fears of an unfair dismissal claim. Mr Entwistle was finally forced to quit after just 54 days in the job after BBC2's Newsnight wrongly implicated Lord McAlpine in a child abuse scandal - leading to a £185,000 payout. He had already faced heavy criticism over the corporation's response to the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, including his own decision to run tribute programmes to the late DJ last Christmas even though he knew he was the subject of an earlier Newsnight investigation. The Pollard Review, examining the shelved Newsnight report into Savile's abuse, is expected to be completed by Christmas, but a second review led by Dame Janet Smith, looking at the culture and practices of the BBC during the years the star worked there, could take much longer. Lord Patten said it was impossible to predict how much they would cost but said they would clearly be expensive, 'partly because of the number of lawyers involved'. The MPs was told that about 40 staff are being investigated over the Savile decision in initial interviews but not all have legal support, which is being capped at up to £50,000.

Difficult time: The Archbishop of Canterbury has revealed how he questioned God's role following the death of his first child in a car crash . The Archbishop of Canterbury has revealed how he questioned God's role following the death of his first child in a car crash. In an emotional interview, the Most Rev Justin Welby told the BBC's Songs of Praise programme how he received the answer he 'did not want' after praying with his wife Caroline following the death of seven-month-old Johanna in 1983. His comments come after a new survey revealed today that four out of five British adults believe in the power of prayer. Johanna died five days after a car being driven in France by a family friend swerved off the road and crashed. The Archbishop told the programme: 'That was prayer at its rawest because it's just prayer of, ""Oh God help. Oh God where are you? What's going on? Are you going to do something or aren't you?"" 'And I suppose the deepest moment in that was finding a moment when we were in a café outside the hospital on the day Johanna died. 'And we were talking and we were praying and we had a sense in ourselves of needing to say to God, 'Your will be done'."" He went on to add: 'Praying that, a sense of handing over — absolutely agonising — and going back to the hospital, and the professor of intensive care saying to us, ""She suddenly seems to be going"". 'The presence of Jesus in that room was simply overwhelming. And there was a sense of handing her over. And that was prayer, at its most profound and getting exactly the answer we didn't want.' The interview was broadcast on Palm Sunday and in the programme the Archbishop also told of the 'enormous privilege' he had in taking on his role as leader of the Church of England. A new survey in the run-up to Easter has found that four out of five British adults believe in the power of prayer. While some said they would pray for world peace, others had more everyday concerns - turning to God for relationship troubles or stressful jobs. Upsetting: The Most Rev Justin Welby has revealed the grief which he and his wife Caroline, left, went through following the death of their first baby . Emotional: During the interview for the BBC's Songs of Praise, the Archbishop of Canterbury looked visibly upset . Women were more likely to pray than men, with 85 per cent citing something they would pray for, according to the ICM poll commissioned by the Church of England. The young and the old were more likely to seek religious guidance than the middle-aged, with 89 per cent of the over-65s and 85 per cent of those aged between 18 and 24 saying they had something to pray for. An end to world poverty, exam success and family and friends' health also featured in the list of most prayed-for topics. Only 14 per cent of participants said they would never pray and 5 per cent said they would not know what to pray for. Sad: The Most Rev Justin Welby said he received the answer he 'did not want' after praying with his wife Caroline following the death of seven-month-old Johanna in 1983. He is pictured during his enthronement last week . Religious: The Archbishop's comments come after a new survey found that four out of five British adults believe in the power of prayer. This is a file picture . The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, said money and employment worries were leading more people to come and talk to him about prayer. He said: 'Prayer is one of the most natural and instinctive of human responses, so I am not surprised to see these findings. I come across people on an almost daily basis who want to talk about prayer and how to do it. 'There has also been a desire to pray for troubled spots in the world, not least when we see the appalling photos from Syria on the television.' A website where people can post their prayers to be read by church groups and communities, www.prayoneforme.org, was launched by the Church of England last year.","The Most Rev Justin Welby revealed anguish in Songs of Praise interview .

Killer grandmother: Miyoko Sumida, 64, the main suspect behind a series of mysterious deaths in Japan, who killed herself today . A Japanese grandmother who allegedly orchestrated the murders of six members of her family so she could make money from insurance claims has killed herself. Miyoko Sumida, 64, the primary suspect behind a series of mysterious deaths in Amagasaki, Japan, took her own life while she was in a holding cell, it was reported today. Despite being on suicide watch it appears as though she choked herself and her body was found in the early hours of this morning. She was taken to hospital where she was confirmed dead. Sumida was the central figure in an investigation into the multiple deaths of people she was related to, or acquainted with, while she was also suspected of killing her husband to claim insurance. Six other people, including her sister-in-law and daughter-in-law, dubbed 'The Piranha Family' have been in custody since November in connection with the case. Six bodies were found in steel drums or wrapped . in blankets and hidden beneath floorboards of family properties. Police said she told investigators she was to blame for everything. The grandmother was arrested following a . tip off to police that a number of people who had visited her luxurious . penthouse apartment in Amagasaki had subsequently disappeared. Sumida was charged with the murder of a 66-year-old woman, Kazuko Oe, whose body was found in November 2011 in a concrete-filled metal drum in a warehouse in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture, the Japan Times reported. She was served with a fresh arrest warrant last month on suspicion of . killing Jiro Hashimoto, 53, one her distant relatives, after his body, encased in concrete and also inside a steel drum, was pulled from a harbor in Okayama Prefecture. New charges were filed against a group of suspects on December 5th for Hashimoto’s confinement and murder. Sumida was also under investigation for her suspected role in a series of other deaths. Police sources told the Japan Times that Sumida was found this morning in her cell after choking herself. Police pull out a steel drum containing the body of the missing man in Okayama, Japan. The body of Jiro Hashimoto, 53, was encased in concrete . According to police, she was . confirmed to have been dozing in her cell until around 6am but ten . minutes later she was found to have stopped breathing. She was immediately taken to a hospital, where she was confirmed dead, the police officials said. In . October, police discovered the partly mummified remains of three . corpses beneath the home of the 88-year-old grandmother of Mrs Sumida’s . daughter-in-law. One of the bodies was identified as Mitsue Ando, 71, the partner of Mrs Sumida’s older brother. The other two were Mariko Nakashima, the 29-year-old older sister of Mrs Sumida’s daughter-in-law, and 68-year-old Takashi Tanimoto, whose elder brother was a friend of Mrs Sumida. An investigation into the killings was also widened to look into the death in 2005 of Mrs Sumida’s husband during a holiday in Okinawa. He was part of a group of nine people having their photo taken . on top of a cliff when he fell. The family received Y90million (£705,218) in insurance and had a property mortgage written off. Police are investigating suggestions from people who were present that the man was coerced into committing suicide, Asia One reported. Other victims had reportedly loaned . money to Sumida or had left property or other assets to her. In police interviews, Sumida’s relatives . said they lived in an apartment with her in Amagasaki last year. They said they . were forced to assault Hashimoto and then lock him in a shed on the . balcony for several days until he died. The police reportedly believe Sumida intentionally made sure he died from neglect. Crime scene: Police divers pictured last month check a pier to find a drum containing a body. Sumida was the central figure in an investigation into the multiple deaths of people she was related to, or acquainted with . According to the police, on October 22, Sumida said to an officer in charge of managing the detention facility in which she was being held: 'I want to die. How can I kill myself'. She also hinted she wanted to commit suicide on three different occasions, according to the Japan Times. The incidents prompted officers to put her on suicide watch. Sumida's lawyer, Hajime Takagi, told reporters today that Sumida had told him it was meaningless to continue living. He said she told him: 'I won't be able to see my family. I have something I want you to convey (to them).' Takagi last saw Sumida on Tuesday evening. At that time, she stood up and bowed to thank him, he said. Police are also investigating two more suspicious deaths, including that of her daughter-in-law's 88-year-old grandmother.

A schoolgirl is feared to have become the youngest victim of a super-strength ecstasy-style drug that has claimed up to ten lives this year. Ellie Jones, 16, suffered breathing difficulties at a friend’s house and died in hospital less than 90 minutes later. Yesterday police revealed that traces of PMA – also known as pink ecstasy – had been found in her system. The drug, nicknamed Dr Death, is sold to revellers for as little as £3 a pill. Ellie Jones, 16, died last Saturday after developing breathing difficulties while at a friend's house. She is believed to be the ninth victim of the drug 'Dr Death' It resembles ecstasy but can be five times as strong. However it takes longer to have an effect, prompting some users to take more pills – and unwittingly give themselves a fatal overdose. Detectives investigating Ellie’s death have arrested six people, including three boys aged 16, on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs and perverting justice. All have been freed on bail. Officers are also working closely with schools, colleges and drug agencies to warn youngsters about the dangers posed by PMA. Ellie collapsed at a friend’s house in Warrington at about 3.30am last Saturday. Paramedics treated her at the scene. She was taken to hospital but died shortly before 5am. Although PMA was found in her system, it has not been confirmed as the cause of her death.Derbyshire Police are already investigating four deaths linked to the drug. They include Rachel Clayton, 34, and her partner Emma Speed, 30, who were found at their home at Macclesfield last month, and student Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, who died in January. Ellie is believed to have taken the super strength form of Ecstasy which can cause dangerous increases in body temperature. Paramedics tried to save her life but she died in hospital . The deaths of five people over the Christmas and New Year period in a 60-mile radius of Manchester were also linked to PMA. Cheshire Police Superintendent Martin Cleworth said: ‘We have a duty to warn people about the potentially fatal consequences taking this drug can have, and would urge people to obtain urgent medical assistance on behalf of anyone suspected to have taken PMA who suffers difficulty breathing, muscle spasms, nausea or starts to vomit. ‘If anyone has any information about who may be supplying this fatal drug, I would urge them to contact police, so we can continue to do all we can to remove them from our streets and prevent anyone else going through the heartache Ellie’s family have gone through.’ Ellie attended St Gregory’s Catholic High School in Warrington, where headmistress Noreen Fawkes said her death  had had a ‘profoundly sad effect’ on everyone. In an online tribute, one friend, Chloe Ford, posted: ‘She never failed to make someone laugh’. Another, Ruth Ann Collopy, wrote: ‘Don’t think I ever saw her around school without a smile on her face! RIP Ell.’ Detectives investigating Ellie's (left) death have arrested six people on suspicion of various offences including supplying Class A drugs. Travis Barber (right), 19, is also thought to have died after taking the drug . Oil rig worker Rachel Clayton (left), 34, and her partner Emma Speed (far left), 30, were found dead at home last month, they are both believed to have taken the drug. Anthony Lennon (right), 28, is also thought to have died after taking 'Dr Death' PMA has also been linked to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Norway and Denmark. The pills – often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and stamped with a McDonald’s-style M – are made from a different amphetamine from that used in ecstasy. Cathy Fitzgerald, from Warrington’s Drug and Alcohol Action Team, said: ‘Drugs have a big effect on people’s health and wellbeing and so we would strongly advise not to take any illegal drugs or “legal highs”, as they all come with great risk. ‘If you or someone you are with find yourselves suffering from the symptoms of this drug, it’s vital that you seek medical attention straight away.’ The deaths of Charlotte Woodiwiss (left), 20, and of Jordan Chambers (right), 19, are also being blamed on 'Dr Death' Gareth Ashton (left), 28, and Dale Yates (right), 18, are also thought to have taken the drug before they died . ‘Dr Death’ tablets are often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and have the chemical name PMA, they are a type of amphetamine known as Paramethoxyamphetamine and are also referred to as 'Mitsubishi Turbos', 'Pink Ecstasy', or 'Pink McDonalds' Tributes have been left outside Ellie's home and police are working with schools and colleges in the area to educate people about the dangers of taking 'Dr Death' 'Dr Death' has been linked to eight other deaths in the UK as well as to deaths in Canada, Ireland, Denmark and Norway.

The murder trial of a high school valedictorian begins today after he allegedly bludgeoned and stabbed his mother to death. Jeffrey Pyne, 22, has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of his mother Ruth whose body was found in the garage of the family's suburban Michigan home. Mrs Pyne, 51, was found in May 2011 by Jeffrey's ten-year-old sister Julia. She had been stabbed 16 times and her head repeatedly beaten with a board. Scroll down for video . Family: Jeffrey, left, stands behind his little sister Julia, beside his mother Ruth and his father Bernard, right, who maintains his son's innocence . Jury selection was under way at Oakland County Circuit this afternoon and could take several days. Jeffrey Pyne was indicted by a secret grand jury five months after his mother's death in 2011. Although little has been revealed pre-trial, it is believed that the prosecution has mentioned wounds to the 22-year-old's hands, according to ABC. Pyne, who was in the midst of a promising academic career studying biology at the University of Michigan, maintains his innocence, saying he was working as a handyman for a neighbor at the time of his mother's death. His father Bernard Pyne also believes that his son is innocent of the brutal slaying on May 27, 2011. If convicted, Jeffrey Pyne faces life without parole. The defense has suggested that the brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News. The 22-year-old has been in jail since being arrested in October last year. He was first held in the same Oakland County prison  where his mother spent two weeks in 2010, charged with beating her son and trying to choke him. Many in the close-knit, rural community of Highland Township knew that the pair had a dysfunctional and volatile relationship. Trial begins: Jeffrey Pyne, 21, faces life in prison if found guilty of the murder of his mother who was found bludgeoned to death in the family garage . Charmed life: The Pyne family owned a roomy tri-level home on a one-acre lot with a pool in Highland Township, a rural community in western Oakland County . Mrs Pyne, a dental hygienist, reportedly suffered from psychosis and paranoid schizophrenia and was involuntarily hospitalized. Court documents stated she needed medication to control her violent tendencies, most of which were targeted towards her son. His father Bernard, a . 52-year-old automotive engineer, maintains his son is innocent and would . never do anything to hurt his mother. Court . records show that it was when Jeffrey was only nine that his mother . started threatening to kill him. Bernard Pyne described his wife as a . 'kind and loving mother' when she had taken her medication. Defense attorney James Champion of Grand Rapids said Jeffrey Pyne played no role in the death. 'This wasn't a case of some kind of . struggle or outburst,' Mr Champion said. 'Jeffrey Pyne did not do this. This is something Jeffrey Dahmer would do, not Jeffrey Pyne.' For . five months her murder was unsolved before the case was taken up by . Oakland County grand jury, convened earlier this year to review dozens . of unsolved homicides. Prosecutors said testimony ties Jeffrey Pyne to . his mother's death. 'The grand jury compelled testimony from . the defendant's family, friends and coworkers, which produced evidence . linking Jeffrey Pyne to the murder,' Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica . Cooper said in announcing the indictment. The . Pynes - who were deeply religious - enrolled their son and daughter at . West Highland Christian Academy where Jeffrey Pyne was described as a . star student and athlete. Accused: Pyne has been described as a star student and a fine athlete . From 1998 onwards, Ruth Pyne's mental . health deteriorated, and she would threaten to kill herself and her son. After this she was diagnosed with being both bipolar and a paranoid . schizophrenic. Over the . coming years, psychiatrists would describe her as 'angry and violent', . 'severely mentally ill', 'a danger to herself and others' and suffering . from 'acute mania', court records show. In . 2009, in a petition to the probate court asking that his wife be . committed to a mental hospital, Bernard Pyne wrote she was refusing . medication, believed a computer chip had been implanted in her daughter . and had been 'striking our son for no reason'. He . had sent their young daughter Julia to stay with relatives. According . to the Detroit Free Press, Bernard Pyne wrote: 'I must work, and can't . monitor her when I work. ... She claims that her family could die, and . it would not bother her at all.' Her treating psychiatrist wrote on October . 7, 2009: 'She is likely to deteriorate severely . and become a danger to herself and others due to her refusal to accept . treatment for her very serious mental illness,' and recommended immediate transport to a mental health hospital . for involuntary commitment. She was in and out of hospital and spent time in jail in 2010 after trying to kill her son. The judge released her on $10,000 bond and said she could return home as long as she took her medication in front of her husband. The trial of Jeffrey Pyne continues.","Jeffrey Pyne, 22, charged with first-degree murder after mother's body found at Michigan home .

At least 10 families have moved back onto the UK's largest illegal travellers' site after bailiffs and council officials completed the  £20million Dale Farm clean-up operation. Basildon Council has obtained an injunction to prevent reoccupation of the site after the removal of caravans and chalets from 51 unauthorised plots was completed on Monday. But this morning, caravans had pulled back onto the illegal half of the site and many remain on the legal side, exceeding the authorised capacity. The return: Less than a day after Basildon Council ended the £18m clearance operation of what was Europe's biggest illegal traveller site on Dale Farm in Essex, travellers have begun moving back on to the illegal site . Basildon council bosses said they are monitoring the situation and will resist any attempt to reoccupy Dale Farm. The council has removed hard standings . and placed earth embankments across the six acre site, preventing . travellers resettling on their old plots. Travellers have parked alongside some of the plots and say they plan to see out the winter on Dale Farm. Tony Ball, leader of Basildon Council, said attempts to reoccupy the site were unacceptable and put them in contempt of court. 'We are now looking carefully at any . breaches on the legal pitches, he said. 'The travellers are fully aware . of how many caravans and mobile homes they can have on any one site. They must not exceed this and if they do we will be taking action. Council workers arrive armed with injunction notices at the Dale Farm site in Essex . He said that the council would continue to enforce the law and insisted the clearance was not motivated by prejudice. Patrick Egan, who is entitled to remain in his house on the illegal site, said: 'Nobody would want to live here - the site is a mess, it's contaminated with asbestos and we have to use a generator for power. 'I am allowed to stay but I don't want to. We have come back because we have nowhere to go.We fully expect the council to serve notices on us, telling us to leave. 'If that happens, we will occupy car parks and roadsides in Basildon, anywhere that we can get access to. The council simply hasn't provided anywhere else for us to go.' Europe’s largest illegal traveller camp has cost £20million so far to clear up, and residents are now worried another battle could be about to start. Lining up: Dozens of touring caravans are lined up around the edge of the land on the remaining hard ground . £18m bombsite: The six acres of land, which have been likened to a 'bombsite' by locals, now stand largely empty . A traveller called Billy said: ‘We are . going back on there and it is going to be just like it was before. The . eviction was one big waste of money. Europe¿s largest illegal traveller camp has cost £20million so far to clear up . ‘We are tough people and we are hardy people, so we will be back on that land and starting all over again'. The . line of caravans increased over the past week with many traveller . families timing their return from Ireland to coincide with the end of . the clean-up work. Basildon . Council, which spent millions clearing the site, was granted a High . Court injunction banning travellers from returning to the site in Crays . Hill, Essex. Len Gridley, 52, whose garden backs on to the site, fears that the threat of prison will not act as a deterrent. ‘I’m really worried that they are . going to move back on to the site,’ he said. ‘There seems to be more . caravans in the area. It’s a complete shambles. ‘The council should have completed the . job properly instead of doing it half-heartedly. I think the travellers . will come back on. There is no doubt about it. ‘The bailiffs have gone and now there is no security left on the site. What did they expect to happen?’ Bailiffs have spent four weeks . removing chalets, caravans and concrete driveways after police gained . control of the site on October 20. New aerial photographs show how each . plot on Dale Farm has been turned into deep craters. Eyesore: The site is left looking like a bombsite, littered with more than 40 craters where bailiffs removed the concrete bases from each plot . Before the eviction: The dotted red line marks the boundary of the illegally occupied area where the Dale Farm travellers had set up their homes . Fences and several buildings have been left standing because of a High Court judgment protecting them. Mr Gridley added: ‘It’s like a bombsite down at the bottom of my garden now and it is certainly no better than when the travellers were there. ‘I have waited for a decade for this moment and now I am left with an eyesore'. Council leader Tony Ball said the authority would be applying for injunctions to move the caravans on. He said: ‘They must seek planning permission before any more development of sites takes place and this is regardless to the fact that they may own the land. ‘Travellers must comply with the law in the same way as everyone else. Nobody wants to see another Dale Farm.’ When asked about the current condition of Dale Farm, he said: ‘We are also committed to restoring Dale Farm to a site in keeping with its green belt status, and would remind people that its current condition is only a temporary measure. ‘Now that the site clearance has been completed we will turn our attention to any remaining breaches of planning regulations on the site'. Eviction protests: Flames engulf a caravan during evictions from Dale Farm travellers camp on October 19 . Eviction process: Police rise up in a cherry picker to talk to protesters stood on a scaffold platform during evictions from Dale Farm travellers' camp on October 19 . Travellers moved on to the greenbelt site a decade ago after buying the land. They then set up homes without planning permission. The total cost of the clearance is expected to soar past £22million. The long and bitter dispute between hundreds of travellers and Basildon Council came to a swift end last month when police and bailiffs moved on to the camp. Activists and travellers who had pledged to ‘fight to the death’ held out for less than 48 hours before walking off the land to allow the full clearance operation to begin. Many of the travellers are thought to be living yards away from where they were evicted, on the legal part of Dale Farm.","Council says it will prosecute travellers who break injunction .

More than a dozen Eton pupils have made the journey from the prestigious public school all the way to Downing Street. David Cameron became the 19th Old Etonian to be elected Prime Minister in 2010, and many of his close political allies also walked the corridors of the renowned Berkshire college as boys. Now an exam paper has revealed how current pupils are being taught to assume they will follow that same well-trodden path - by drafting speeches they would deliver to the nation as its leader. Born to rule: A question on the Eton College King's Scholarship exam paper asks pupils to 'imagine you are the prime minister' A question on a paper sat by 12-year-old pupils in 2011 gives a telling glimpse into how Eton fosters ambition in its students from an early age, by asking them to imagine they are running the country. It appeared on the 2011 King's Scholarship Examination paper, which can be viewed on the school's website, and asked students to consider whether 'it is better to be loved than feared'. It reads: 'The year is 2040. There . have been riots in the streets of London after Britain has run out of . petrol because of an oil crisis in the Middle East.' Old boys: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and London Mayor Boris Johnson, right, both attended Eton . Students are asked to imagine that protesters have attacked public buildings, and that policemen have been killed. 'Consequently, the Government has . deployed the Army to curb the protests... 25 protesters have been killed . by the Army,' it goes on. 'You are the Prime Minister,' the . paper says, before instructing the young Etonians to draft the script . for a speech to be broadcast to the nation explaining why deploying the . Army was 'both necessary and moral'. Along with David Cameron, London . Mayor Boris Johnson also attended Eton, as did his brother Jo Johnson - . who last month was appointed head of Mr Cameron's new policy unit. MPs Oliver Letwin, Nick Hurd and Jesse Norman - newly appointed to the prime minister's policy advisory board - and Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn are all old Etonians, as are chief whip Sir George Young and Foreign Minister Hugo Swire.

"By . Jim Murphy, Shadow Defence Secretary . PUBLISHED: . 16:37 EST, 25 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:24 EST, 25 May 2013 . Honour: Shadow Defence Minister Jim Murphy has called on the nation to mark Armed Forces Day . The country reacted with collective revulsion at the brutal murder of Drummer Lee Rigby. A young hero whose life was stolen. The barbaric act of terror, so graphic on our TV screens, will not go unpunished and nor will it be forgotten. The family of that young, distinguished, slain soldier will be in the thoughts of everyone who has a heart and in the prayers of each of us who has a faith. So how should we respond? Politicians shouldn’t change our foreign or defence policies. A tiny minority in our country will act out a malevolent revenge which the police will deal with. But for everyone else we have a different responsibility. Our reaction is one of the things that the extremists hate about us. It is that British spirit of resolve, solidarity, openness and justice that should triumph. Our nation is a remarkable blend of modernity and enduring institutions including the Monarchy, NHS and the BBC. But nothing captures that spirit more exquisitely than our Armed Forces. They are people from  every corner of our islands, all with their own histories, many placing  a personal faith in their own God. I remember a visit to Afghanistan when I met some of the many  hundreds of British Muslims,  patriots one and all, serving in Her  Majesty’s Forces. Wherever they come from, whether they pray from a Bible, Koran or Torah or not at all, they all serve with one thing in common – a determination to keep our country safe and free. In our prayers: Drummer Lee Rigby with his wife Rebecca on their wedding day . Response: Mr Murphy says Armed Forces Day on June 29 is a chance to demonstrate the strength of unity between the Services and our country in the wake of Drummer Rigby's death . Their acts of collective courage and individual ingenuity in the dust and danger of battlefields overseas is  awe-inspiring. We . all have it in us to celebrate their quiet dignity. We can give to one . of our great military charities by all means but let’s do something . else  as well. Armed Forces Day on June 29 is a chance to demonstrate . the strength of unity between the Services and our country. Hundreds of floral tributes were left in tribute to Lee Rigby yesterday at the spot where he was killed. Union and St George’s flags were draped among the bouquets, along with Manchester United football shirts, recognising his support for the club. In one touching message, a picture of Drummer Rigby and his two-year-old son Jack was pinned to the railings with the caption: ‘Daddy and his little soldier! R.I.P Lee’. A young woman wearing a green hoodie sobbed and wiped tears from her eyes  as she arrived to read the messages of condolence. She was with more than a dozen friends and family members, many visibly upset. A peaceful march was held nearby by members of the Nigerian community to distance themselves from the two suspects, whose roots lie in the West African country. Scores of motorcyclists supporting the Help For Heroes charity also rode past the scene in a show of support. I was troubled at suggestions that members of the Armed Forces should not wear their uniforms in public in response to Wednesday’s atrocity. In the chaotic aftermath this may have been momentarily necessary, but a longer-term shift towards our Forces and veterans being invisible on British streets would be the wrong response. David Cameron’s advice after Wednesday was to ‘act normally’.  I agree. Up to a point. Everyday life must continue, but a haunting act demands an extraordinary reaction. The response to dramatic events can be as important as the events themselves. Londoners making their way in to work after the 7/7 terror attacks sticks in all our minds. An overwhelming public show of support for our Armed Forces would do the same. That is why the forthcoming Armed Forces Day can mark a moment of defiance and celebration: defiance against our aggressors, celebration of who our Armed Forces are and what they achieve. As long as the security advice is . clear then on June 29 members of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces could be . encouraged to publicly wear their uniform even if off-duty. Veterans of all generations could wear . their medals or military attire. And we, all of us, can do something . important that will take only three seconds. Because that’s all it would . take to say ‘thank you’ to a member of our Armed Forces. We . don’t just want to see uniformed personnel in ceremonial parades; we . want to see them on our streets and in shops, at fairs and fetes, on . public transport and as part of our communities. We all know that during . the 1970s and 1980s the Forces were advised not to wear uniforms off . base because of IRA/INLA terrorism. That was relaxed after the  Belfast . Agreement. In memory: Mourners and well-wishers left flowers at the scene in Woolwich where Drummer Rigby tragically died . Sea of flowers: Floral tributes outside the main gate of the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, south-east London . Outpouring of grief: Thousands of wellwishers have paid their respects where the young father was brutally slain . But we can do more than that. Polling shows nearly two-thirds of the public consider there is too little  recognition for the Armed Forces. At the same time more than one-in-five members of the Forces said they had experienced abuse while wearing their uniform in public in the last  five years. It is unacceptable to abuse those who serve, but the well of inherent support is an opportunity for us now to stand up and be counted ourselves. It is less than a week since the  horror in Woolwich and just over a month until Armed Forces Day. But we should all ask ourselves: ‘What am I personally going to do in memory of all of those who have been lost, including Lee Rigby, or injured, or who still serve today?’ This year don’t leave it to someone else to celebrate Armed  Forces Day.","Shadow Defence Secretary calls on nation to mark Armed Forces Day .

"By . Chris Brooke . UPDATED: . 01:09 EST, 30 May 2012 . A mother whose two-year-old son died after drinking plant food intended for a cannabis crop smiled unashamedly after a judge spared her jail yesterday. Giving Lauren Booth a suspended sentence, Judge Colin Burn said she would have to live with the consequences of her ‘cataclysmic’ neglect ‘long after any sentence has been served’. But far from showing  remorse, the 24-year-old smiled as she left court and jokingly asked photographers: ‘Are you going to follow me all the way home?’ Lauren Booth, right, was growing cannabis in her home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and was asleep when her son Aaron, left, drank the toxic liquid . Booth, of Huddersfield, was convicted . of child cruelty in February. She had left a bottle of pH Up plant feed . on a windowsill within easy reach of her ‘inquisitive and adventurous’ toddler Aaron. Its childproof lid had not been screwed on properly. In November 2010, Booth, who was still . in bed with her then boyfriend Shaun Williams after midday, was woken . by a bang and found her son had collapsed and was gasping for breath. The trial heard that the toddler, who . had not been fed and was probably extremely hungry and thirsty, may have . thought the plant feed was a children’s Fruit Shoot drink. Tragic toddler Aaron Booth died after drinking toxic plant food meant to help his mother Lauren's cannabis grow, thinking it was a Fruit Shoot drink (right). Pictured left is a stock image of a cannabis plant . Aaron was taken to hospital and . underwent surgery to remove his stomach and part of his oesophagus, but . his windpipe had been burned away by the potassium hydroxide contained . in the toxic plant feed. He died 11 days later. Prosecutor Thomas Storey said that . when Aaron’s father Mohammed Khan visited the hospital,  Booth seemed . more concerned about moving her cannabis plants than her son’s . condition. He recounted: ‘She told him that she . and her partner had been trying to make some money by growing skunk [a . type of cannabis] in the house, almost seeming annoyed by the . involvement of the police because they were going to have to find . somewhere else to grow [the drugs].’ The home of Lauren Booth, in Huddersfield, where toddler Aaron drank from a bottle of plant food . Yesterday the judge said: ‘I’m bound . to say that Aaron’s death was a prolonged and frankly horrible one. There is no other way to describe it. And it was preventable.’ He told Booth: ‘Your poor judgment led . to fatal consequences. The evidence that this liquid was used for . growing cannabis was strong. You should not even have allowed the liquid . to be brought into the same house as Aaron. ‘By failing to move the bottle, or supervise him, you allowed this terrible event to happen.’ A jury had heard that police found . material relating to cannabis-growing on a computer in the cluttered . house, but Aaron’s bedroom was ‘curiously empty’. The prosecution said . Mr Williams had time to remove any plants after the child went to . hospital. Booth, who now has a daughter aged . almost one whom she is allowed to visit in foster care, denies that . cannabis was grown in the house. She was given a 12-month jail sentence, . suspended for two years. The judge said a pre-sentence report . stated that Booth had been a loving mother to Aaron and no purpose would . be served by her going to jail. But Mr Khan, 33, said outside Bradford . Crown Court yesterday: ‘It’s sickening. I’m shocked. Where’s the . justice for Aaron? I wanted justice for him. I expected Lauren to be . sent to jail. But now she can just carry on with her life as if Aaron . never existed. ‘I don’t believe she has ever shown remorse. She’s got her life but Aaron hasn’t got his. She  should pay the consequences.’","Aaron Booth died 11 days after drinking the toxic liquid .

"By . Gill Hornby . PUBLISHED: . 17:55 EST, 22 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:38 EST, 23 May 2013 . There I was, minding my own business, waiting for one of my children to mooch their way through the school gate when I noticed I had some very smart company: another mother who didn’t normally give little me the time of day. In our little playground hive, she was undoubtedly the Queen Bee. To what could I possibly owe the pleasure? We were chatting away like old mates. Get me, I thought: I must be in with the in-crowd at last. Then, as our offspring finally appeared, she leaned in and asked, in the sweetest possible way: ‘Stating the obvious, but have you taken your child to see a doctor? Just to check there’s nothing actually properly seriously wrong with them . . .’ You've been stung: The Queen Bee may appear to be nice to you then hit you with an insult . Zing! Ouch! Of course. She had come over to sting me. And she had judged it expertly: the perfect blend of kind, considerate, caring, mother-to-mother concern that can, on a bad day, reduce you to a gibbering, paranoid wreck. My four children, now aged from 22 down to 12, went to various primary schools around the Home Counties. But talking to friends further afield, I found that they could also match my experience, sting for sting. In Kent, a friend met a mother who had improved her obnoxious child’s behaviour with a nutritional programme and generously offered to share it: ‘You never know, it might just help with your boy . . .’ Near Leeds, a friend was with her lovely gaggle of children and was stopped by a school-gate mum: ‘Aren’t they just adorable? I’m so intrigued by the unusual size of their heads.’ It doesn’t matter where you are. Go to any playground of any primary school - rural or urban, wealthy or not - and it’s the same story. Every community has its Queen Bee. She’s probably good-looking. She’s certainly confident. Hers is always the life that shimmers: domestic perfection bathed in a honeyed glow. Everyone, including you, wants to get on with her, even to be her friend. When she’s nice to you, she makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. High standards: Carole Middleton got under the skin of another mother when Kate and Pippa were at school because they always seemed so perfect . But, just occasionally, often when your guard is down or you’re feeling pretty chipper, she will come out with something toxic. And that’s it. You drag your feet all the way back home. Your little bubble has been burst. You haven’t felt this rubbish since . . . Exactly. There comes a moment early on in every half-sentient parent’s life, at a school gathering - the first PTA meeting, cake sale or quiz, oh yes, especially the quiz - when you are assaulted by the blinding flash of a profound, even existential, truth. 'The Queen Bee of the school gate can mutate into the strongest, most terrifying and most magnificent of her species' Hang on a minute. This feels just like being back at school. These aren’t fellow grown-ups: they are familiar stereotypes that last time you clocked them had ink on their fingers and Clearasil on their spots. And you and all these other mothers will be appearing together in a torrid social melodrama that is to be played out, week in, week out, over the next seven years. Groups will form and groups will fall apart: the cool ones, the keen ones, the sporty ones, the naughty ones. Even the ones who despise all social groups will find each other and start to hang out. Friends will be made, some may be lost. But all the while, Queen Bees will reign over us all. This is not a pattern unique to girls at school or the mothers who take them there. It is how female society tends to function. Marlborough College: These school gates still haunt a mother who used to compare herself to the impressive Mrs Middleton . You will see the same thing, on a smaller scale, in book groups, NCT classes or female-dominated offices. Every ring will have its leader: there will always be the stinger and there will always be the stung. I remember discussing a career break with a fellow professional. ‘It’s so much easier for someone like you to decide,’ she sighed. ‘But I earn six figures.’ Zing! Any group of women together for a regular amount of time will somehow, instinctively, elect itself a leader. And there’s perhaps no stronger example of this than at the school gate. Millions of us swarm there twice a day, five times a week, for years. And we’re not just looking after ourselves - we are looking out for our children. That is why, as many of us know to our cost, the Queen Bee of the school gate can mutate into the strongest, most terrifying and most magnificent of her species. And that is why sometimes she can get so out of control, she just has to come a cropper. In my new novel, The Hive, I explore exactly this: the transfer of power from one Queen Bee to another. It does happen. Years of slavish devotion from an adoring clique and absolute power as the head of a parents’ association can turn even the nicest of heads and suddenly you find you have created a monster. She organises all the exercise classes - why shouldn’t she be the one to point out someone’s gained a couple of extra pounds? She’s found a tennis teacher for the children - but we can’t really open lessons to just anyone . . . And, of course, there wouldn’t even be a girls’ night out if it wasn’t for her - surely she was allowed to exclude just a couple of, um, you know, dull people? And she’ll hand out the invitations for the sixth birthday party round here, too, just so everyone knows where they stand. Winning mentality: The Queen Bee will always come out on top - until other women can join up to drive her out of the hive . Power corrupts, after all. And a Queen Bee can only use so many stings before she finds she’s  suddenly being driven out of her hive and the women who surround her are looking around for someone else to adore. Of course, a lot of Queen Bees are pretty amazing: saintly, charismatic heroines who do wonders for the community. Even the annoying ones who drive us demented are pretty useful, too. Look at your children’s school and ask yourself: would that library, playground, fete or just that lovely present for the teacher exist if it was up to the rest of us? Not a chance. We’d never get our acts together. That is partly why we have developed that instinct to elevate Queen Bees into a position of power in the first place. They bother so we don’t have to. And there is also a very good case to be made for the hive. Why do women group together in these gangs and cliques in the first place? Because we are determined to bond. 'The school days of our children are not . only vivid while we live through them, they also somehow mark themselves . indelibly upon our minds' Give us ten minutes waiting outside Brownies or swimming lessons and we will learn not just the names and ages of the other woman’s children, but also which one has eczema (poor love) and who’s top of the class (oh yes, she had to get that in). While we can never be quite sure what children are really getting out of their primary schooldays, we do know their parents are making friends - and enemies - for life. It may sound depressing, but it’s true: when you hit your 50s, you might not be able to remember what the milk’s doing in the bread bin or why you just went upstairs, but you do still have total recall of all those families with whom you connected over your children’s formative years. The school days of our children are not only vivid while we live through them, they also somehow mark themselves indelibly upon our minds. Just the other day, someone whose children were contemporaries of the Middletons finally broke her silence on her own deep psychological wounds. The girls’ name tapes so neatly sown in; their manners so perfect . . . Carole’s impressively high standards of parenting had obviously been driving this woman nuts for years. The whole family had got under her skin. And that was before one of them managed to bagsie a Royal. (Let’s just pause for a moment to imagine how that news must have gone down.) Honestly. What sort of a weirdo must you be to not only notice the technique of name-tape application, but to remember it 15 years later?  Well - ahem! - quite an average sort of weirdo, really. Recently, at the dentist, I fell out of the chair into a woman who went to school with me. ‘I was so hoping to see you at X’s the other day, at that great big reunion,’ she said. Humph! Even if I had been invited I probably wouldn’t have gone. Whatever. Yet - zing! zap! - she’d got me again anyway: still stinging after all these years.

The Duke and Duchess could be welcoming their new baby as early as the end of April, marking the second anniversary of their marriage.

The happy announcement that Kate is expecting has sparked immediate speculation about when the child will be born – and inevitably when he or she was conceived. Scroll down for video . Speculation: Rumours abounded in September that the Duchess might have been expecting when the royal couple visited Singapore as part of an official tour and chinked glasses of iced water at a gala reception . Fond farewell: After a successful tour in mid-September, when the baby could have been conceived, the Duke and Duchess waved goodbye to the South Pacific . As St James' Palace have confirmed . that Kate is not yet 12 weeks pregnant, she could not have been carrying . the baby during their now infamous holiday to the south of France, in . which she was photographed topless by a private pool. The sun-kissed break at Chateau . D’Autet, a luxury holiday chateau in Provence which is owned . by Viscount Linley, the Queen’s nephew, was followed by a tour of Asia. But royal sources do not believe . that the future King or Queen was conceived in the searing heat of the . Far East, during the tour to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. This is because Kate was said to have been taking . anti-malarial tablets while on the tour, which is not advised during . pregnancy, and so it is unlikely that she was trying to conceive there. Wearing a floral print, floaty summer dress, Kate, with William, watched a ceremony to mark their farewell in Tuvalu . The baby could have been conceived any . time after September 10 this year, and depending on the exact date, . is likely to be born in May, June or July next year. The timing of the tour in mid-September could well mean the baby, born third in line to the throne, was conceived somewhere exotic - although Mail Online understands that Kate was not pregnant during the couple's tour of South-East Asia and the South Pacific. On September 11, Kate and Wills began the Diamond Jubilee tour, starting off in Singapore, where temperatures reached a steamy 36 degrees. During the trip, the Duke revealed the couple's plans to start a family after being quizzed by a little boy. The plucky youngster had asked how big a family the Prince would like.

David Cameron blocked a peerage for Ann Widdecombe allegedly because of her opposition to fox hunting, the former Tory MP says. In a new book, serialised in The Mail on Sunday, she says that as a former Minister she ‘had a strong probability’ of joining the House of Lords when she left the Commons in 2010. But she says Mr Cameron, a supporter of hunting, was determined to stop it. Unburdened: Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe has revealed the details of her rise to the top of politics in her memoir . Agree to disagree: David Cameron and Ann Widdecombe were on opposite sides of the fox hunting debate. She writes that rumours circled Westminster that the PM had 'set his face against' her getting a peerage . In her blockbuster memoirs, Strictly . Ann, Ms Widdecombe says she knew she wouldn’t get a peerage ‘because I . had received private intelligence from an unimpeachable source that . Cameron had set his face against it’. Ms . Widdecombe claims that Tory peer Lord Strathclyde ‘said in front of . others it was because of hunting,’ though she observes: ‘I cannot . believe Cameron is that petty or so much in the grip of the . squirearchy.’ Ms Widdecombe . says she opposed ‘big-headed’ Mr Cameron becoming Tory leader because . of his inexperience, claiming it was ‘madness’ to give him the job. She says the party became ‘image obsessed’ under his command. Former . Prisons Minister Ms Widdecombe also uses the book to reopen her feud . with her former boss, Michael Howard, whom she once famously described . as having ‘something of the night’ about him. On the hunt: Ann Widdecombe said she struggled to believe that David Cameron would be as petty as to deny her of a peerage . Ms . Widdecombe gives the first full account of her explosive fallout with . the former Home Secretary over his sacking of jails boss Derek Lewis . after a series of prison escapes. Nearly 20 years after the event, she offers a fresh, devastating critique of Howard’s character. At various points, she calls him ‘gloating’, ‘vindictive’, ‘gratuitously vengeful’, ‘nasty’, ‘autocratic’ and ‘bullying’. She says he lacks ‘humanity’ and he was ‘given to kicking men when they were down’. She . reveals Howard begged former Prime Minister John Major to order her not . to wreck Howard’s Tory leadership bid in 2001 – but Major refused. Instead, . Ms Widdecombe writes:  ‘I saw him smile slightly as he said, “I will . tell Michael you are of fixed purpose,” ’ she writes. Astonishingly, . Ms Widdecombe says Sir John went further and told her he had rebuked . Howard over anonymous briefings which tried to smear her by falsely . claiming she was ‘in love’ with Lewis. Sir . John said the briefings were ‘a disgrace’– and had told Howard so. Describing her battle with Mr Howard as ‘mortal combat’, Ms Widdecombe . says that when her attack killed off his first leadership bid she sent . a  triumphant message to Mr Lewis: ‘MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.’ Widdecombe's tagets: The Tory grandee said fellow politicians John Redwood (left) undermined her with silly games and Iain Duncan Smith (right) lacks charisma . Straight shooter: Ann Widdecombe gives the inside story on her dealings with Frances Maude (left) and Michael Portillo (right) who she calls 'arrogant' In . one of the most sustained political attacks by one senior Tory on . another, Ms Widdecombe says of Mr Howard, who did become Tory leader in . 2003: ‘He could have been a political giant had he only learned to . distinguish between toughness and bullying and decisiveness and . autocracy, if he had known when to stop delivering punishment, if his . smile did not remind me  of the face of the proverbial tiger, and if he . had some humanity. ‘I would . trust him with anything except people. I would fight alongside him in . the jungle...but if the battle went wrong he would look for . someone to court martial – or just shoot.’ Nor . does Ms Widdecombe pull her punches in describing other Tory foes.

"By . Ian Drury . UPDATED: . 09:16 EST, 25 June 2011 . Nato forces are successfully tracking Colonel Muammar Gaddafi from lair to lair around Libya, it has been revealed yesterday. RAF Nimrod R1 spy planes, drones and the destroyer HMS Liverpool - stationed off the Libyan coast and packed with state-of-the-art eavesdropping equipment - are monitoring the desperate tyrant's movement, the Mail has learned. The dictator has been 'racing from one place to another' over the past few weeks to avoid falling into enemy hands as his grip on his country loosens, said sources. On Gaddafi's tail: An RAF Tornado jet heads for Tripoli after taking off from the Italian Airforce base of Gioia del Colle . Nato commanders are not permitted to directly attack Gaddafi under the UN mandate which allows them to use military force to protect civilians. Even if he is identified at a control or command centre - making him a legitimate bombing target - commanders are wary of launching a devastating strike for fear the cowardly Libyan leader is hiding behind a 'human shield' of innocent people. But military chiefs are hoping the mounting pressure from wave after wave of airstrikes will cause his regime to 'implode' with close aides removing him. Details of how closely Gaddafi was being watched by the coalition were disclosed by Whitehall sources as Nato marked 100 days of airstrikes. On the run: Alliance chiefs are confident that time is running out for embattled Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi . Major General Nick Pope, the senior British military spokesman, said Nato carried out more than 12,000 flying sorties, including 5,000 attack missions, of which 2,400 had hit regime targets - suggesting a less than 50 per cent success rate. However, the figures were later clarified by a NATO official: 'The figure of 5,000 relates to the number of fast jet aircraft that have taken off as part of the ""protection of civilians"" element the NATO mission being carried out under UNSCR 1973. 'The 2,500 figure occurs because targets are often struck by more than one aircraft, at other times aircraft may not release weapons at all. 'It is important to remember that this mission is about the protection of civilians, and the real measure of success is the effect of our operation on Qadhafi’s forces, not the number of bombs dropped; and that success is borne out in towns like Ajdabiya and Misrata, who’s populations were being pounded daily by the regime, and who are now returning to some sort of normality.' But many missions were aborted in the final minuites to avoid hitting civilians. Bang on target: A Libyan man walks along a bomb-damaged street in the Libyan port city of Misrata . Loyal support: Libyan women chant and hold Colonel Gaddafi's portraits as they rally at the Green Square in downtown Tripoli . RAF planes have twice pulled out of missions in recent days because of concerns innocent people might be endangered - precision-guided missiles were fired but diverted onto wasteland to avoid possible casualties. On other occasions, RAF planes were sent on attack missions without specified targets - ordered to scour Libya from 30,000 feet in the hope of spotting regime tanks or rocket launchers. Major General Pope said the British military had destroyed more than 500 targets, including 240 armoured vehicles or artillery installations and 150 buildings, including bunkers and ammunition stores. The Ministry of Defence revealed yesterday that the UK's part in the Nato operation is costing taxpayers £43million per month. Night attack: Rebel fighters fire a Grad rocket at the front line west of Misrata . British diplomats insisted it was a matter of 'when, not if' Gaddafi would be toppled. A senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office official claimed the momentum had 'shifted irrevocably' against the dictator and he was down to a 'handful' of followers. In May alone around 150 senior officers defected from his Army, including five generals. Reports suggested Gaddafi had threatened to kill generals who failed to reclaim the rebel-held city of Misrata. 'The sands of time are running down for Gaddafi,' said the diplomatic source. 'Gaddafi's actions have stripped him of legitimacy. There can be no future for Libya with him in power. 'The anger against him is simmering. The question is not if he will go, but when.' The diplomat spoke at the end of a troubling week for the coalition. Up to nine civilians were killed on Sunday after a Nato missile hit a home in Tripoli. Casualties of war: Residents examine the remains of a building in Tripoli following a Nato airstrike on Sunday. Nine civilians are believed to have died in the attack . The tragedy prompted the Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini to demand a ceasefire. The international criminal court is poised on Monday to issue arrest warrants on Gaddafi and two of his inner circle for war crimes. Today, dozens of rebels previously detained in Tripoli were returned to their eastern stronghold on a Red Cross ship, and gave details of how they were tortured at the hands of government forces. The ship carrying 51 prisoners also . brought back 249 people  to Benghazi who wanted be reunited with family . in eastern Libya, a Red Cross spokesman said. It was not immediately . clear whether there had been a prisoner swap with the Gaddafi . government. 'They electrocuted us, they tortured us in every possible way,' said Yousef al-Fetori, who had been detained in the capital. 'They broke my ribs, hand and leg.' Port in a storm: Rebel prisoners formally held by the Gaddafi regime arrive safely in rebel-held port of Juliana . Welcome back: A passenger is embraced after disembarking from the Red Cross ship . The Red Cross spokesman denied that there were any prisoners from Benghazi being swapped on board. However, a spokesman for the rebels' transitional government said five prisoners had previously been sent back to Tripoli, though the rebels had not been aware the Red Cross was returning people to Benghazi. Libyan rebels in the east say they are now in close contact with an underground network of opponents of Gaddafi in Tripoli. A member of the rebels' National Transitional Council in rebel-held Benghazi revealed they were holding secret talks via Skype and satellite phone to prepare for the regime's fall. Rising to the challenge: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged fellow Democrats to back the campaign to oust Gaddafi . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a rallying cry when she met with scores of House Democrats, urging them to vote against an impending measure to block funding for American operations in Libya.In emphatic language, Mrs. Clinton warned them a House resolution that would bar money for most military activities in Libya would be disastrous to American interests in that war-torn nation.'We have seen an international coalition come together unprecedented between not only Nato, but Arab nations, the Arab League, and the United Nations,' Mrs Clinton said. 'This is something that I don't think anyone could have predicted, but it is a very strong signal as to what the world expects to have happen, and I say with all respect that the Congress is certainly free to raise any questions or objections, and I'm sure I will hear that tomorrow when I testify.'But the bottom line is, whose side are you on? Are you on Gaddafi's side or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them? For the Obama Administration, the answer to that question is very easy.'","Rebels released by Libyan government claim they were tortured .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:54 EST, 23 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:57 EST, 24 May 2013 . The Boy Scouts of America threw open its ranks Thursday to gay Scouts but not gay Scout leaders - a fiercely contested compromise that some warned could fracture the organisation and lead to mass defections of members and donors. Of the roughly 1,400 voting members of the BSA's National Council who cast ballots, 61 per cent supported the proposal drafted by the governing Executive Committee. The policy change is due to take effect on January 1 next year. 'While people have different opinions about this policy, we can all agree that kids are better off when they are in Scouting,' the BSA said after announcing the results at the council's annual meeting near Dallas. Scroll down for video . Pascal Tessier, 16, from Kensington, Maryland, an openly gay scout who was facing expulsion from the Boy Scouts speaks to the media after Thursday's announcement . However, the outcome will not end the bitter debate over the Scouts' membership policy. Liberal Scout leaders - while supporting the proposal to accept gay youth - have made clear they want the ban on gay adults lifted as well. In contrast, conservatives with the Scouts - including some churches that sponsor Scout units - wanted to continue excluding gay youths, in some cases threatening to defect if the ban were lifted. 'We are deeply saddened,' said Frank Page, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's executive committee after learning of the result. 'Homosexual behavior is incompatible with the principles enshrined in the Scout oath and Scout law.' The Assemblies of God, another conservative denomination, said the policy change 'will lead to a mass exodus from the Boy Scout program.' Jennifer Tyrrell, left, who was removed from her position as a den leader in 2012 for being gay, hugs Pascal Tessier, 16, after a resolution passed to allow openly gay scouts in the Boy Scouts of America . The result was welcomed by many gay-rights groups, which joined in the call for an end to the ban on gay adults. 'I'm so proud of how far we've come, but until there's a place for everyone in Scouting, my work will continue,' said Jennifer Tyrrell, who's ouster as a Cub Scout den leader in Ohio because she is lesbian launched a national protest movement. The vote followed what the BSA described as 'the most comprehensive listening exercise in Scouting's history' to gauge opinions within the community. The BSA could also take a hit financially. Many Scout units in conservative areas fear their local donors will stop giving if the ban on gay youth is lifted. The BSA executive committee suggested a plan in January to give sponsors of local Scout units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders or continuing to exclude them. Angry: The decision, which still denies adults from serving as Scout leaders, is anticipated to upset conservative groups who believe that gays should not be allowed in the BSA at all . However, the plan won little praise, and the BSA changed course after assessing responses to surveys sent out starting in February to members of the Scouting community. Of the more than 200,000 leaders, parents and youth members who responded, 61 per cent supported the current policy of excluding gays, while 34 per cent opposed it. However, most parents of young Scouts, as while as youth members themselves, opposed the ban. The proposal approved Thursday was seen as a compromise, and the Scouts stressed that they would not condone sexual conduct by any Scout - gay or straight. 'The Boy Scouts of America will not sacrifice its mission, or the youth served by the movement, by allowing the organization to be consumed by a single, divisive, and unresolved societal issue,' a BSA statement said. Since the executive committee just completed a lengthy review process, 'there are no plans for further review on this matter,' the group said. The BSA's overall 'traditional youth membership' - Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers - is now about 2.6 million, compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past. It also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers. Zach Wahls, executive director of Scouts for Equality, a pro gay group, reacts to the news that a resolution has been passed to allow openly gay scouts in the Boy Scouts of America . Of the more than 100,000 Scouting units in the U.S., 70 per cent are chartered by religious institutions. Those include liberal churches opposed to any ban on gays, but some of the largest sponsors are relatively conservative denominations that have previously supported the broad ban - notably the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Southern Baptist churches. The BSA, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010, has long excluded both gays and atheists. Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's right to exclude gays. Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies, and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy.

Huge swathes of Stockholm were in ruins today after a fourth night of rioting left hundreds of cars ablaze and saw mobs attacking police with bricks. The violence, which began in the immigrant enclave of Husby on Sunday night after police shot an elderly man who threatened them with a machete, has now spread to 15 suburbs. It has morphed into a protest by largely immigrant demonstrators about underlying racism in Swedish society - and an apparent lack of employment opportunities. Last night, officers battled desperately to keep the city under control as a police station was set alight and fire services were kept from a major blaze by an angry stone-throwing mob. Scroll down for video . Stockholm burning: A car is set ablaze in a suburb north of the Swedish capital last night .

Chaos: Police have been under attack by large mobs, pelting them and fire services with bricks and heavy rocks, preventing them from putting out fires across the city's fringes . 'The local families I met yesterday are extremely angry and sad and they hope those responsible get harsh sentences,' Adam Khoder, a member of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt’s Moderate Party at Rinkeby-Kista council, which governs Husby, said. In Skogås, south of Stockholm, emergency services were kept from a fire in a restaurant when a mob of youths pelted the fire engines with rocks. Police had to be called to 'chase away' the violent gang before work could begin to control the flames. In nearby Rågsved, yobs set fire to the police station - the second police station to come under attack in two days. In Husby, where the violence started earlier this week, police found themselves under attack by youths throwing bricks and large stones. By 2am this morning, Stockholm’s Fire Services had dealt with 75-80 incidents, a majority of which were related to the riots. As well as setting cars ablaze, rioters also attacked a police station and a school and nursery . The unrest appears to have been sparked after police shot and killed a man wielding a machete on Sunday .

Plumber Daniel Hickling caused a gas explosion which blew a house off its foundations and injured the owner and his wife . An incompetent workman who caused a gas explosion that blew a mansion off its foundations after botching a simple repair job was today given a suspended jail sentence. Plumber Daniel Hickling, 32, agreed to cut off and cap two gas pipes at the luxury home in Lincolnshire, despite not being qualified to do the work. A hole he left in one of the pipes caused a leak that led to an explosion within hours of him finishing work at the detached home in Nettleton, on the edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds. Lincoln Crown Court was told that Hickling, who was not Gas Safe registered and had never been trained in gas work, left the LPG gas supply turned off at the property when he left. And he failed to carry out a legally required test for leaks before finishing. Hickling admitted to 'failings' and that he lost concentration while working on the job, but claimed he believed he was working on a water pipe and not a gas pipe. After hearing evidence Recorder Helen Malcolm QC ruled that the plumbing and heating engineer either knew, or obviously should have known, the pipe carried gas and should not have started the job. Hickling was given an 11 month jail . sentence suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 300 hours of . unpaid work and pay £2,000 towards prosecution costs. The court was told the couple that owned the house, Martyn and Teresa Moody, called in Hickling to bury the gas pipes as part of renovations to convert a former kitchen into a dining room after an extension was added to their home. The Moodys smelt gas while watching television following their evening meal. They began searching the property and Mr Moody, out of instinct, flicked on a cigarette lighter while checking one of the rooms. Seconds later the house blew up. The . blast had such force that the entire building moved an inch. The . windows and front door were blown out and the ground floor of the home . was severely damaged. Debris was thrown 100 yards away. The 63-year-old, who had recently sold his own construction and electrical business, spent two weeks in hospital after he suffered serious burns to his hands, arms and scalp and had to undergo skin grafts. He has been left scarred for life. Teresa Moody (left) suffered burns to her legs and feet. She was released after two days in hospital. Martyn Moody (right) suffered serious burns to his hands, arms and scalp and had to undergo skin grafts . His wife Teresa suffered burns to her legs and feet. She spent two days in hospital before being released. The house, which was built for the couple in 1993,  had to be completely . rebuilt and the Moodys lived in a caravan for more than a year before . they were able to move back in. Mr Moody said 'It was devastating. The house had to be rebuilt. We were . out of our home for just over a year. We were under-insured. We haven’t . been paid for our uninsured losses. That was £100,000. It’s not been a . great year.' Hickling ,33, of Howsham, Lincolnshire, pleaded guilty to three charges . relating to the incident in July 2011 but disputed the prosecution case . that he knew he was working on gas pipes. He admitted charges of carrying out work to an inappropriate standard, . carrying out work while not registered with the Gas Safety Register and . carrying out gas fitting work he was not competent of doing so in breach . of the 1998 Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulation. Rebuilt: The large detached home, which the couple had built for themselves back in 1993, was so badly damaged that it had to be virtually completely rebuilt and it was a year before the couple were able to move back in . Recorder Malcolm told him: 'The work that you did fell far below an acceptable standard and left a very dangerous situation. 'In the event there was a disastrous . explosion caused by your work. There were considerable and serious . injuries to both of the Moodys and the total destruction of their house . and its contents. 'Mr Moody’s comment that it has not been the best year must be one of the understatements of the century.' James Puzey, prosecuting for the . Health and Safety Executive, said 'Mr Hickling was incompetent to carry . out this work and it was carried out incompetently. That led directly to . an explosion which almost destroyed the property and caused serious . injury to the householders. 'It is incredible that an inexperienced plumbing and heating engineer could mistake gas pipes for water pipes.' Underinsured: The entrance to the home of Martyn and Teresa Moody . Gareth Weetman, defending, said . Hickling’s income from his plumbing business had dropped by almost half . since the explosion and he has built up debts leaving him 'on the brink . of bankruptcy'. Speaking after the hearing HSE . inspector David Butter, who investigated the case,  said: 'Anybody who . carries out work on gas pipes or appliances without being on the Gas . Safe Register is breaking the law. 'Daniel Hickling endangered the lives of this couple as soon as he began work. They are extremely lucky to have survived. 'It is essential that homeowners and . businesses check gas installers are registered with Gas Safe before . having work carried out to ensure the job is completed to the required . safe standard.","Daniel Hickling, 32, given an 11 month suspended prison sentence .

His brutal death outraged Britain, but Woolwich murder victim Drummer Lee Rigby may be honoured with a funeral at Southwark Cathedral, it emerged last night. The young soldier’s shockingly brutal death  has brought calls for the celebration of his life to be a fitting tribute, and it is expected that hundreds of his friends and comrades will want to bid him farewell. Southwark, because of its size and proximity to 25-year-old Lee’s barracks in Woolwich, would be ‘an appropriate and fitting venue for such an occasion,’ said a church source. Victim: Lee Rigby, 25, the victim of the Woolwich knife attack . Such a large ceremony would provide a poignant illustration of the . nation’s support for the soldier who was knifed to death last week. With so many of his comrades, friends and relatives wanting to attend . Lee’s funeral, a large church will needed and 1,500 mourners could fit . inside Southwark Cathedral, believed to be the capital’s oldest, dating . back to 606AD. But Lee’s family from Manchester – mother Lyn and and stepfather Ian - . will of course have the final say along with his wife Rebecca. His parents live in Middleton , Manchester. But the city’s cathedral cannot be used due to restoration work taking place there. Tribute: Southwark Cathedral, London's oldest cathedral, may host Lee Rigby's funeral . Last night, they were still coming to terms with his tragic death just yards from the barracks. The service is likely to take place in two to three weeks, given the criminal investigation into his death. A military funeral, with soldiers from Lee’s unit - the Royal Regiment . of Fusiliers mounting a guard of honour, would be arranged by the Army . Chaplaincy Service. His colleagues from the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, . are planning a poignant cermonial tribute to their fallen comrade - a . drumhead ceremony which dates back to the Battle of Waterloo. The ceremony, which is rarely performed, involves hundreds of personnel . gathering on a parade square. One by one the drummers march in single . file to the middle of the square and place their drums on the ground. The bass drum is placed at the back with the smaller drums in front. Rifles are then placed against the drums and the regimental colours are . draped over the top. Regimental pipers then play the Last Post. Mourning: Floral tributes outside the main gate of the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich . Tears: A man puts down flowers at the scene where Lee Rigby died in Woolwich . A Fusiliers’ source said: ‘This is the most appropriate tribute we can . put on for Lee, given the time he spent in the band. The drumhead . ceremony has been performed in the same fashion for centuries and . according to strict guidelines. ‘From a distance the drums and flags look like an altar. Hundreds of . years ago the drumhead ceremony was performed on the battlefield as . soldiers fallen in combat were lowered into the earth. Today it remains a . deeply moving occasion.’ A time and venue for the Fusiliers’ drumhead ceremony is yet to decided . but The Mail on Sunday understands that Lee’s family will be invited to . attend. Meanwhile, calls for a minute’s silence across Britain next week at the time when he was killed were growing last night. On social media network Twitter people from all backgrounds demanded . that their employers allow them to pay their respects to the tragic . soldier next Wednesday afternoon. The deep emotions stirred by Afghan veteran Lee’s death in such . appalling circumstances were clear to see yesterday as thousands of . bouquets and floral tributes built up at the site where he was hacked to . death. While a backlash of anger has been apparent in many areas of the country . following Drummer Rigby’s murder, at the spot where it happened, . comments were mostly confined to paying tribute to a fallen son and . offering comfort to his loved ones. A steady stream of well-wishers added to the hundreds of flowers left at . the corner of John Wilson Street, where three days earlier the . 25-year-old father-of-one died at the hands of two suspected terrorists. In one heartfelt message, a picture of Drummer Rigby with his . two-year-old son Jack was pinned to the railings, with the caption . “Daddy and his little soldier! R.I.P Lee”. Knife attack: 28 year-old Michael Adebolajo was filmed with blood on his hands after Lee Rigby was stabbed to death . Union and St George’s flags were draped among the flowers, while a . number of Manchester United football shirts were on display to recognise . the young man’s lifelong support for the club. Emotions were clearly still raw when a young woman broke down in tears as she arrived to see the sea of flowers. Wearing a green hoodie, she sobbed and wiped tears from her eyes with a . tissue as she read messages of condolence left for Drummer Rigby. She was surrounded by more than a dozen friends and family members, many of whom appeared visibly upset. A peaceful march was also held in the area by members of the Nigerian . community in an attempt to distance themselves from the two murder . suspects whose roots lie in the West African country. Nigerian Kanbi Ojelade, 50, was among those paying their respects today, . along with his two sons, Umran, 10, and Feranmi, 11, who both live in . Woolwich. Mr Ojelade, who lives in Colchester, said: ‘I brought them here to . realise people are responsible for their freedom, safety, their welfare . and development. ‘The ultimate price anyone can pay is to give his life for others.’ Royal British Legion member Charles Clayton, 66, said he believed the . Government could have done more to identify the terror suspects earlier. ‘He shouldn’t be forgotten,’ Mr Clayton said. ‘It demonstrates the society we now live in. I blame the Government for . allowing this to go unchecked which puts us all at risk.’ Scores of motorcyclists supporting the Help For Heroes charity – whose . teeshirt which Lee was wearing may have singled him out as a victim - . rode past the scene yesterday in a show of support for Drummer Rigby’s . family.","London's Southwark Cathedral can accommodate up to 1,500 people .

A van driver has today admitted running down and killing a mother-of-three during a hit and run rampage that injured more than 12 others. Matthew Tvrdon mowed down parents and young children during the spree in Cardiff in October last year in which Karina Menzies was hit and killed. He pleaded not guilty to her murder today but admitted her manslaughter with diminished responsibility. Tvrdon appeared via videolink at Cardiff Crown Court from Ashworth high security psychiatric hospital in Maghull, Merseyside. The court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack. Seven children were among more than a dozen people hurt in the hit and run spree. He admitted seven charges of attempted murder, two of grievous bodily harm with intent and two of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent. Tvrdon also admitted four charges of causing actual bodily harm and one of dangerous driving. But the court heard he denied murder of Karina. A decision on whether he will go to trial will be made before a hearing next month. Prosecutor Ian Murphy said: 'At the time the defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. 'He has admitted some serious charges - one of manslaughter and seven of attempted murder as well as lesser charges including assault with a Crooklock. 'We have not had a chance to involve the victims and their families and are requesting an adjournment in order to do this.' Tvrdon appeared relaxed and calm in the video link to court, dressed in a black top and trousers and wearing glasses. He was originally charged with one count of murder, 13 counts of attempted murder, four counts of actual bodily harm and one of dangerous driving. Karina died at the scene and 13 others were treated in hospital - two were in a critical but stable condition. Her daughter Tiana, three, suffered a fractured pelvis and broken legs while sister Ellie, eight, had a head injury. Both have made a full recovery. Matthew Tvrdon denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility . Mourners placed flowers next to where Karina died in October . Karina was killed outside Ely Fire Station - one of five scenes in Ely and Leckwith in Cardiff where people were struck by the white Iveco van. The mother-of-three managed . to throw her daughters to safety but friends said at the time that she . could not run away from the vehicle because she suffered from a . progressive nerve condition. They said her legs had been weakened by  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease that damages nerves outside the brain and spine. She was described as a 'hero' by her brother Craig, who paid tribute to her after the October attack. He said: 'She’s got [the children] . out of the way and, at the same time, put herself between them and the . van to prevent it hitting them. She’s let the van take her. ‘She would have done this . instinctively because that is the person my sister was. She was the . bravest, kindest, most loyal person in the world and I can’t believe . she’s gone.’ The guilty pleas today follow a series of behind-the-scenes conferences between the prosecution and defence lawyers. The case was adjourned until June 5. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Karina Menzies died in a 30 minute hit-and-run frenzy in October .

Eight-year-old Charlotte Tait has an IQ of 130 but she has been known to slap, bite and pull the hair of her teachers after quickly losing her temper when she feels she is not being listened to . A girl of eight with suspected autism has been expelled from three schools as her parents wait desperately for her to be assessed for special educational needs. Charlotte Tait is extraordinarily bright, with an IQ of 130, but finds it difficult to control her temper and lashes out at pupils and teachers when upset. Her parents, Arthur and Maxine, are convinced their daughter has Asperger’s syndrome but she is not entitled to the special teaching she needs until she is diagnosed by a doctor. The couple, who run a soft play centre and have two younger children, have been waiting almost a year to get a medical assessment. In the meantime, Charlotte has just been excluded from her third school after violent tantrums were too much for the teachers. Mr Tait, 53, said: ‘We are a family that is going through hell. We are at the end of our tether.’ He and his wife, from Malton, North Yorkshire, say Charlotte’s behaviour deteriorated two years ago when a new teacher arrived and the layout of her classroom was changed. Mrs Tait, 42, said: ‘Charlotte can’t cope with change and for her that was a huge change to her daily routine. Her behaviour deteriorated and before she was expelled we were getting calls on a daily basis.’ Charlotte’s troubles at school started taking up so much time, her parents said they had to give up their business to care for her. She was excluded from her first school in April last year after she started pushing other children and then kicked and punched teachers who tried to stop her. She was excluded again in September last year, and last Monday her latest school had also had enough. Despair: Charlotte's parents Arthur and Maxine Tait believe that their daughter is a sufferer of Asperger syndrome - a type of autism that means sufferers have difficulty communicating . ‘The problem is that staff are not trained to look after pupils like . Charlotte and so, by trying to diffuse the situation, they actually just . escalate it,’ Mrs Tait said. Last December, despairing teachers even locked Charlotte out in the playground on her own for an hour to try to calm her. Lessons: Charlotte is now having to be home-educated through an online programme . ‘We were so angry when we heard about this,’ her mother said. ‘This is just an example of how they have no concept of how to look after a child with Charlotte’s condition. ‘She views things differently to us. The slightest things can set her . off, such as if she’s dressed in different coloured trousers to her . sister, or if someone brushed past her. We know what sets her off and . can usually stop it before it starts but other people just can’t get a . grip on it.’ ‘We feel completely let down by the system. The help Charlotte needs is . not available and we’re having to go through hell to try and get it.’ Charlotte has now been offered a place at a special school in Cumbria in September. She would have to board during the week, because there are no suitable schools for her in North Yorkshire. Her medical assessment is not due until October. Mrs Tait said: ‘We’re hoping that, after she has the assessment, she will be taught ways of understanding her condition and how to manage it, so hopefully in the not too distant future she will be able to return to a school nearer home.’ She added: ‘I can’t even begin to explain the impact this has had on our family and the longer we have to wait for an assessment, the worse it’s going to get.’ A spokesman for the Scarborough and Ryedale Clinical Commissioning Group, which plans local health services, said it was examining the circumstances of Charlotte’s case but could not discuss details .","Charlotte Tait has been expelled from three primary schools in Yorkshire .

His colleague on the 32ft yacht Caprice could not understand the French coastguard, so called his Crediton builders merchant - who raised the alarm with Brixham Coastguard. The yachtsman is now being treated for hypothermia in hospital. Unlikely saviour: A worker at a builders merchant in Devon was shocked when a customer rang him to ask for his help reporting a man overboard from a yacht near the French coast The customer struggled to understand the French coast guard. File picture . Chris Tucker, who works for Jewson in Crediton, said he was 'a bit surprised' when his customer phoned him at about 3pm. 'I'm not quite sure why he called me, but maybe he knew I'd be there and would have access to a computer and phone,' Mr Tucker said. 'It was quite difficult to hear him because it was so windy, but he just kept repeating coordinates and times. 'He said he couldn't understand the French coastguards and they didn't understand him.' Mr Tucker said he had seen his customer on Tuesday so knew he was planning a sailing trip. 'He'd told me he was going on his friend's yacht and they were going to take it down to the south of France to leave it there for the summer, then get the ferry back,' he said. Mr Tucker stayed on the phone to his customer while Brixham Coastguards liaised with the French authorities. The Ilfracombe man was swept into the sea off Ushant, north west France, on Thursday afternoon . The man who fell overboard is from Ilfracombe in Devon. He is now recovering in hospital . The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the search for the missing yachtsman involved a French lifeboat, two search and rescue helicopters, a fixed-wing aircraft, along with two naval vessels - from France and Germany - that happened to be in the area at the time. He was rescued by the German warship and then airlifted to hospital in France. 'The man who fell overboard was wearing a lifejacket and also a type of wet suit, which undoubtedly saved his life,' the MCA said. Mr Tucker, whose actions were praised by Brixham Coastguard and Jewsons, said he was glad both men were safe. 'It wasn't sounding too good for a while,' he said. 'Conditions were pretty damn rough, the yacht's engines had failed and the guy must have been in the water for about two hours. 'I don't think I did anything special - anyone would've done the same - I'm just happy they're okay.' The stricken yacht was towed back to harbour by the French lifeboat.

'One by one, they can be replaced. A lot of it wasn't even important, but I couldn't replace him,' Ms Garcia says while holding her dog securely in her battered arms late this week. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Reunited: Barbara Garcia is holding her dog Bowser a little closer today after briefly losing him in last week's deadly tornado in Moore, Oklahoma last week . Miracle: Ms Garcia presumed her little dog was killed but during an on-camera interview outside her home's wreckage the dog was found wiggling beneath piles of debris . Ms Garcia was being interviewed amid splintered wood, metal and other wreckage immediately after the storm when a CBS producer noticed the dog wiggling directly behind her. The grandmother only moments before reasoned that this must be 'life in the big city' while presuming the dog had been killed after calling for it hopelessly but without any answer. To everyone's astonishment, however, the dog survived. On camera Ms Garcia is seen in tears as she struggles to dig her pet out and then come to terms with what she considered to be a miracle.

A Spice Girls fan has been evicted from his home after constantly playing the girl band's number one hit - Viva Forever. Gavin Townroe, 34, played the 1998 love ballad so loudly that one nearby resident had to be signed off sick from work due to lack of sleep. Other neighbours at the same block of flats, in Nottingham, would even leave their homes just to get away from the constant sound of the popstars - dubbed Sporty, Baby, Posh, Scary and Ginger  - which would be repeatedly played at all hours. A Spice Girls fan has been evicted from his home after driving his neighbours round the bend by constantly playing the girl band's number one hit - Viva Forever . Police began investigating Townroe last year after numerous reports from people living nearby about the music coming from his council flat. He was initially given an ASBO demanding he keep the volume down after officers noted noise levels at his home. Then, in October last year he was given a six week suspended jail term after a court heard he breached the order by carrying on with his noisy antics. Today Nottingham City Council revealed they have now succeeded in evicting him from the flat. At a possession hearing last Monday at Nottinghamshire County Court he was now told he must vacate his property by February 4 and pay costs of £913. Enforcement officer Wayne Cliff said: 'Despite being warned, Mr Townroe had a total disregard for his neighbours. 'At times the volume was so loud residents would leave their properties to escape the music.' Gavin Townroe, 34, played the love ballad so loudly he drove neighbours at Digby Court (pictured) round the bend . Nottingham Labour councillor Alex Norris added: 'There was a total disregard for other residents' enjoyment of their homes. 'This behaviour has lost him his tenancy.' Digby Court, where Townroe lived, is run by Nottingham City Homes and is one of five blocks of flats in Lenton. Gill Moy, director of housing at Nottingham City Homes, said after the case: 'The playing of loud music at all times is unacceptable and something we take very seriously. 'Neighbours should never be subjected to anti social behaviour like this.' One of his neighbours, Salah Alsayed, 33, yesterday revealed he had first complained about Townroe in January 2011. He said: 'As well as the Spice Girls, it was different music too - rock, dance, R and B. I like music too - but not like that. 'Friday, Saturday, you don't mind, but seven days a week is very difficult to deal with. 'Sometimes it would happen at seven, eight o'clock in the morning - I don't mind the Spice Girls but not at that time in the morning.'","Gavin Townroe, 34, played the ballad so loudly neighbours in Nottingham, would leave their homes just to get away from the constant sound .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:53 EST, 21 October 2011 . An Alabama man who has spent just four years on death row for the fatal suffocation and beating his infant son was put to death by lethal injection on Thursday evening. The execution of Christopher Thomas Johnson, 39, took place at  the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. For his last meal, Johnson had a turkey bologna sandwich with cheese and tomato, a grape Sunkist, french fries, Reeses peanut butter cups and pretzels. For his last meal, Christopher Johnson had a turkey bologna sandwich with cheese and tomato, a grape Sunkist, french fries, Reeses peanut butter cups and pretzels . Though he extended his visiting hours during his last day, his only visitor was his brother, Thomas Eugene Lagos. Johnson made the rare move of pleading guilty to capital murder in the 2005 death of his six-month-old son Elias Ocean Johnson. This case stands as one of the quickest death penalty case in recent memory, as it only took six years for the murderer to be put to death after the crime. The inmate himself requested the death penalty, which was granted in February 2007, and waived all appellate and intervention measures on his behalf. Johnson represented himself at trial. He testified he killed his son because 'he hated his wife, didn't want to be near her and didn't want to worry about her threats of putting him in jail for alimony or child support,' according to documents filed by the state Attorney General's Office. Johnson offered no mitigating circumstances for his crime, and the trial court found the 'the heinous, atrocious and cruel' nature of the murder outweighed any justifications that could have been offered, records show. According to court documents, Johnson tried to quiet Elias while his wife slept. After several unsuccessful attempts in the early morning hours, he 'laid on top of Elias, covered Elias' mouth with his hand for extended periods of time, and forced his fingers into the child's mouth and down his throat to stop the crying'. He also struck the child with his hand. During his trial, Johnson said that “You go see Jesus,” were the last words he said to his son. When the child's mother awoke, Elias was unresponsive and cold to the touch. The forensic pathologist who performed Elias' autopsy testified during the trial that the infant suffered at least 85 separate injuries. Suffocation and head trauma were cited as the causes of death.

He testified he killed his son because 'he hated his wife, didn't want to be near her and didn't want to worry about her threats of putting him in jail for alimony or child support' Johnson's ex-wife Dana spoke to a local Alabama newspaper for the first time since the murder, saying that she welcomes Christopher's death. 'Although I normally do not agree with capital punishment, I will not lose any sleep over this particular execution.  Whether it is right or wrong I  feel that a weight will be lifted from my soul on Thursday, and finally I will feel relief,' Dana said to NorthEscambia.com. 'I am scarred by this, and Christopher took away my son, my trust in other people, and even my desire to ever have another child.  I still have a hard time being around children because of the sorrow it makes me feel.  Everyday I see children that are Elias’ age, and I wonder what he would have been like,' she continued. Ms Johnson has since moved to an unidentified city out West and is currently studying to become a nurse. 'My son was the most delightful calm little boy I have ever known.  Christopher Johnson took him from me.  I have spent years trying to heal from this unimaginable pain,' she said. One law professor said Johnson's brief stay on death row is unusual and could possibly be among the shortest on record nationwide. Donald Q. Cochran, a former prosecutor and a professor at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, said the only other case he could recall following such an abrupt time line was that of confessed Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. The two cases- Johnson and McVeigh- are tied, as both took six years between the time of the crime and the execution. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, the average time an inmate spends on death row awaiting execution is 14 years, with many waiting longer than 20 years. Johnson was the sixth inmate executed in Alabama this year and the 38th put to death nationwide in 2011. In a statement issued by Project Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty, executive director Esther Brown said even though the organization respects Johnson's right to have the death penalty imposed, they questioned his motives. 'We are a prisoner organization and therefore respect a prisoner's wishes. Nevertheless, we question Mr. Johnson's mental stability, which would allow him to make this kind of decision,' Brown said.","'You go see Jesus,' were the last words he said to six-month-old boy .
