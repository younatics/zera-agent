'Pixie has an account which I opened a week after she was born and anything that she earns goes into that account so when she's older, she has a good start,' the 34-year-old previously told the MailOnline. 'I'm going to teach her to be smart with her money, as my parents did with me, work hard, earn it but don’t blow it on materialistic things until you have property. 'It's like driving a Ferrari but renting where you live – I am of the breed you buy where you have to live and in turn be extravagant with token items.' Baby's first Chanel: Pixie Curtis does a spot of shopping at the chic Chanel store in Milan during her vacation last week. Living the high life!

'I guess it’s the entrepreneur in me. If I can help the kids get a head start – fantastic!' In a move that Jacenko described as 'ludicrous', the popular Instagram account was temporarily removed in June this year. The mother-of-two was outraged when her daughter's account was deleted, with Instagram claiming it violated the photo-sharing app's age restrictions. Pixie Curtis makes around $200 for her sponsored posts on Instagram, where the sassy toddler and her PR expert mother, Ms Jacenko post photos to spruik products. She also uses the social media image-sharing site to promote her own accessory line, 'Pixie's Bows.' The photo above was shared on Instagram to offer her followers an exclusive discount for her hair bows. Here comes the Prince! Pixie Curtis' three-month-old baby brother, Hunter Curtis (pictured middle) has more than 3000 followers on his Instagram account, but is yet to post a photo - which is quite understandable... But after writing to Instagram headquarters explaining the account is not run by a two-year-old but in fact her social media savvy mother the account was re-activated. 'It's all a bit silly really, a harmless account run by a 33-year-old mother to share funny content – it's hardly breaking any laws,' Ms Jacenko said. Roxy and her troubled investment banker husband Oliver Curtis welcomed Hunter into the world in May. Hunter has more than three thousand followers on Instagram, but the three-month old is yet to post a photo. 'When the time is right I will start doing some posts of his journey with his sister ... to share the images with friends and family,' she explained. The children's finance professional father faces possible jail time over insider trading allegations. Earlier this year, Curtis entered a plea of not guilty at an arraignment hearing on charges he traded illegally to make a $1 million profit. He is currently on bail. Look out world! The adorable little girl poses in front of her family's Louis Vuitton luggage, sending a message of peace to the close to 30 thousand people that follow to see her daily posts.","Daughter of Sydney PR expert Roxy Jacenko is making global headlines .

"Matt Tribe had just purchased his Never Ending Pasta Pass from Olive Garden when a wave of regret washed over him like Alfredo sauce drowning a bowl of fettuccine. 'I started wondering if I had made a mistake because I didn't know how I was going to eat enough pasta to justify buying the $100 pass,' according to the Ogden man. That's when he hit upon the idea for seven weeks of Random Acts of Pasta, where he would use his unlimited supply of Olive Garden to give away free dinners throughout Salt Lake City. Scroll down for video . Delivery: Matt Tribe of Ogden hit upon the idea to give away dinners when he realized he couldn't eat enough pasta by himself to justify the cost of his Never Ending Pasta Pass . A video of the stunt, in which Tribe hands out  pasta dinners to homeless residents of Salt Lake City, has gone viral, leading some to believe it was a cynical marketing ploy by the restaurant chain. Olive Garden tweeted Saturday, denying any involvement with Tribe's video. 'To set things straight—our only role was selling Matt a Pasta Pass & fulfilling his orders,' the company stated to several users from its Twitter account. According to the site documenting Tribe's efforts, the first recipient was his sister, Mandy, who was gifted a fettuccine Alfredo with salad and breadsticks. From there, he says he dropped off dinners to friends, chased down his mailman and two UPS men with pasta, and treated a couple named Ben and Jessica to a meal. When he showed up to his niece's first birthday pasta in hand, Tribe says his sister 'decided that it was tacky that I brought Olive Garden to the party and so she hid it under the table.' Guardian angel(hair): Tribe dropped off dinners to friends, chased down his mailman and two UPS men with pasta, and treated a couple named Ben and Jessica to a meal . Unlimited pasta: Tribe unwrapped his pasta pass and waited for the opportunity to start surprising people with free meals . Denial: Olive Garden tried to come to the defense of a disheartened Tribe, who had been accused on sites like Reddit of being a corporate carbo shill . Tribe - who admits he ate 14 meals himself, sometimes after not finding anyone to deliver them to - says he delivered ten of the 100 meals from Random Acts of Pasta to homeless residents in Salt Lake City. He said he was touched  when one woman said she was planning on sharing her meal with friends and went on a pasta run to bring them more meals. On his last day, Tribe committed to seeing how many Olive Gardens he could visit in a single night, which brought him to five locations for seven meals. After that, he passed off the responsibility of the Pasta Pass to his sister, who gave out an extra 25 meals during the last two weeks. In the end, Tribe says, the best Olive Garden was in Riverdale, while the worst was a location in downtown Salt Lake City, where he was IDed for his meal and watched a manager yell at the staff. Still he calls his act of carbo benevolence 'one of the most fun and fulfilling things I've ever done.' 'Perhaps it's because I live a very boring and uneventful life and doing anything is be better than the alternative, or perhaps it's because that during the time I was doing Random Acts of Pasta, the only thing on my mind was who I was going to take pasta to.'","Matt Tribe of Ogden, Utah, purchased one of Olive Garden's 1000 Never Ending Pasta Passes in September .

"For years, English wine has been dismissed as being no match for more sophisticated vintages from across the Channel. But brilliant weather and clever grape choices mean that, this year, experts believe wines from England and Wales — where there are now 432 vineyards — may be as good as, if not even superior to, their Gallic rivals. So we asked wine expert Jilly Goolden to take a ‘blind’ taste test to see if this can really be true. We chose eight popular wines with similar blends, vintages and prices. Could Jilly tell the difference between the English crop and French versions — and which did she prefer? For years, English wine has been dismissed as being no match for more sophisticated vintages from across the Channel. So we asked wine expert Jilly Goolden to take a ‘blind’ taste test to see if this can really be true. WHITE . BOLNEY ESTATE PINOT GRIS, 2013, SUSSEX . £16.99, Wine Pantry, winepantry.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: Wow. This is sensational. It’s as silky and smooth as a baby’s bottom, with a little talcum powder sweetness. I love the gentle perfume and the hint of sweetness. It’s head and shoulders above its Italian rival. It’s hard to believe our favourite tipple, Italian pinot grigio, is made from the same grape. This is light-years better and worth the extra bucks. It’s so deliciously different — I’m plumping for an exciting English wine producer. JILLY’S GUESS: English . Bolney Estate Pinot Gris and Kulmann Pinot Gris . CORRECT . KUHLMANN PLATZ PINOT GRIS, 2013, ALSACE . £8.99, Majestic, majestic.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: Very ‘so what?’. It tastes a lot rougher — like biting into a conker. You’d need some food to mop up the rather harsh flavour. It’s a bog-standard French wine — I suspect from Alsace. Very traditional with no crowd appeal. JILLY’S GUESS: French . CORRECT . JILLY’S FAVOURITE: English . CHAPEL DOWN FLINT DRY CHARDONNAY MIX, 2013, KENT . £9.99, Waitrose, waitrose.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: A reasonable white — I think a mix of chardonnay and other grapes. The slightly unpleasant fizziness reminds me of drinking liver salts for a hangover. The grapes taste very fresh, which I put down to young vines and not enough sun. That means it’s English. JILLY’S GUESS: English . CORRECT . MACON VILLAGES CHARDONNAY, 2013, BURGUNDY . £9.49, M&S, marksandspencer.com . JILLY SAYS: The rich, straw colour suggests a grape from mature vines ripened under a hot Mediterranean sun. It’s a very acceptable chardonnay with a satisfying peachy and slightly nutty flavour — and no fizziness. Delicious and unquestionably French. JILLY’S GUESS: French . CORRECT . JILLY’S FAVOURITE: French . ROSÉ . Somborne Valley Estate Rosé . CAMEL VALLEY ROSÉ, 2013, BODMIN, CORNWALL . £16, Wine Pantry, winepantry.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: Rosé used to be dismissed as a girlie drink — cheap, cheerful and a bit too sweet. But it’s grown up massively, as this lovely bottle proves. The great thing about a good rosé like this is it has enough dryness and depth of flavour to complement every style of food. I doubt it’s English because I don’t believe any producer has cracked rosé yet. JILLY’S GUESS: French . WRONG . CALVET ROSÉ, 2013, SANCERRE . £14,99, Waitrose, waitrose.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: They’re so alike, they could be twins. This has the same streamlined quality and depth. It’s a tough call, but I’m going for English. JILLY’S GUESS: English . WRONG . JILLY’S FAVOURITE: Even . SOMBORNE VALLEY ESTATE ROSÉ, 2013, HAMPSHIRE . £9.49, Waitrose, waitrose.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: Just one sniff and my teeth are on edge. It smells sickly sweet and tastes horribly sugary. It’s like eating a three-year-old’s mashed-up sweetie collection. I’m getting everything from Slush Puppies to bubblegum. It’s a disaster. I reckon it’s English. They’ve jumped on the rosé bandwagon and tried too hard. Yuck. JILLY’S GUESS: English . CORRECT . LA GRILLE PINOT NOIR ROSÉ, 2013, MASSIF CENTRAL . £8.99, Majestic, majestic.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: This is a gorgeous pinot noir. It’s a coral colour and smells of strawberries and cream. It tastes deliciously clean, dry and not too sweet. It’s everything I want from a producer who knows his stuff, so I believe it’s an experienced French grower. JILLY’S GUESS: French . CORRECT . JILLY’S FAVOURITE: French . RED . Gusborne Estate Pinot Noir and Red Burgundy Pinot Noir . GUSBOURNE ESTATE PINOT NOIR, 2011, KENT . £17.45, Berry Bros, bbr.com . JILLY SAYS: Divine. This cannot possibly be English because we struggle to make good red. Pinot noir’s a tricksy little grape. Like a flirty girl, she’s incredibly fussy and demanding and will storm out unless the conditions are perfect. I reckon this is from Burgundy — home of the pinot noir. JILLY’S GUESS: French . WRONG . NICOLAS POTEL BOURGOGNE PINOT NOIR, 2013, BURGUNDY . £12.99, Majestic, majestic.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: A really mediocre burgundy — definitely English. We may have come on by leaps and bounds with sparkling and white wine, but our temperature makes it really hard to ripen grapes enough to produce a smooth red. This is like drinking red wine and soda. Definitely not for me. JILLY’S GUESS: English . WRONG . MY FAVOURITE: English . BOLNEY ESTATE PINOT NOIR, 2013, SUSSEX . £15.99, Wine Pantry, winepantry.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: It’s a little acidic, which makes me think the grapes are under-ripe. A good burgundy should be smoother and more rounded. It’s a good effort but I reckon it’s from a new English producer. JILLY’S GUESS: English . CORRECT . RED BURGUNDY PINOT NOIR, 2012, BOURGOGNE . £8.69, Tesco, tesco.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: This isn’t a great burgundy. There’s a rather unpleasant lingering aftertaste of compost. And it’s rough around the edges. But I still reckon it’s French. JILLY’S GUESS: French . CORRECT . JILLY’S FAVOURITE: French . Chapel Down Kent Sparkling rosé and Alexandre Bonnet Rosé . SPARKLING . NYETIMBER CLASSIC CUVEE, 2009, SUSSEX, . £31.99, Waitrose, waitrose.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: This is English — and all the better for it. It manages to do everything a good champagne should. It’s soft, delicate, subtle and incredibly moreish. I’m convinced it’s from the South Downs, where the best English fizz is from. Believe it or not, the average temperature is marginally warmer than in Champagne itself. Making champagne this good is like climbing Everest — and they’ve done it. Hooray! JILLY’S GUESS: English . CORRECT . NICOLAS FEUILLATE, NV, CHAMPAGNE . £31.99, Tesco, tesco.co.uk . JILLY SAYS: It’s hard to credit this bog-standard champagne is made from the same grape following the same method. Unlike the delicious English fizz, it tastes as if it has been thrown together on a production line. It’s coarse. The producers are resting on their laurels and it shows. JILLY’S GUESS: French . CORRECT . MY FAVOURITE: English . CHAPEL DOWN SPARKLING ROSÉ, NV, KENT . £22, M&S, marksandspencer.com . JILLY SAYS: Delicately fizzy — just how rosé champagne should be. Rosé used to be a smoke screen for inferior quality because you can hide shortcomings with a boost of sugar. But pink fizz has pulled its socks up. This is utterly delicious. I think it’s French because — while we’ve mastered champagne — we still haven’t cracked sparkling rosé. JILLY’S GUESS: French . WRONG . ALEXANDRE BONNET ROSÉ, NV, CHAMPAGNE . £21.59 (normally £26.99), Waitrose, waitrose.co.uk . Jilly says she's thrilled she got some wrong and that she preferred some English wines . JILLY SAYS: This is lovely, but not quite as good. I like the rounded, gentle taste but it needs more body. Unlike any other rosé, champagne rosé is made by adding red wine to white wine, blending and then making it fizzy. Normally you would ferment with red skins to give the body. I think it’s English because the other is undoubtedly French. JILLY’S GUESS: English . WRONG . MY FAVOURITE: English . JILLY’S OVERALL VERDICT: I’m actually thrilled I got some wrong and that I preferred some English. It proves how far our wines have come. We have been creeping up to challenge France for the past few years. And now, as this shows, we’ve done it!

"Kris Jenner's ex-husband Bruce Jenner was a world famous athlete who found fame representing his country. He was younger than Kris - by four years. Now MailOnline can disclose that the new man in her life is also a sports hero, albeit at a lower level. Handsome Corey Gamble was a standout star for his high school football team and was known by friends as 'Mr Dependable,' MailOnline can reveal exclusively. it can also be disclosed that Gamble, who vacationed with Jenner in Mexico, is not 41, as had previously been reported, but 33. The age gap makes him 26 years her junior - and younger than her two eldest children, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian who are 34 and 35 respetively. Scroll down for video . New squeeze: Kris Jenner couldn't get close enough to boyfriend Corey Gamble after they returned from their romantic Mexican getaway. She's 59, he's 33 . Football hero: Corey, top row far right,  is aged 16 and member of the Junior Varsity Football Team at Westlake High School in Atlanta, where he grew up . High school hero: Corey was 15 (left) and 17 when he posed for these Westlake high school class shots . Shake it up: Corey calls Justin Bieber his 'nephew' as they chug Oreo milkshakes . Corey, who was spotted yesterday having lunch with momager Kris and daughters Khloe and Kourtney, was known for his cool and calm leadership in the field during his teen years. Friends interviewed by MailOnline revealed that Gamble was one of the top players during his time at Westlake High School in Atlanta, Georgia. Such was his leadership prowess he was one of the three captains chosen to lead the team. The high school is famous in football circles for having five players on the NFL roster in one year - more than any other school in the country. Former players include quarterback Cam Newton, Adam 'Pac man' Jones who played for the Cincinnati Bengals and Keyaron Fox who won a Super Bowl ring with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Another former alumni is Kasim Reed, the current Mayor of Atlanta. Former classmates remember Gamble as a hard-working student who was able to combine the punishing schedule of high school sports activities for the 'Lions' football team with his studies. After graduating from Westlake in 1999 he attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he obtained a degree in Business Management. Gamble left Atlanta for Los Angeles soon after college to make his name in the music business and while mixing in the show business world met 59-year-old Jenner. Take off: Kris and Corey prepare for their Mexican vacay and guess who's tagging along? Kim and Kanye. He is younger than Kim by a year . World traveler: Corey is proud of his travels, here at the Great Wall of China . Despite the 26-year age gap, the couple seem set for a long relationship with members of Jenner's family giving their approval to Gamble. He is currently part of the management team of Justin Bieber and has posted numerous photos of himself with the singer on his various social media accounts. Private jets and luxury hotels feature prominently on his Instagram account - although he has been uncharacteristically silent since he began dating Jenner. The relationship with Jenner has thrust him into the spotlight and that is something friends from his days at Westlake said would make him uncomfortable. 'The Corey I knew would not want to be the center of attention,' said a former school mate Sean Powell. 'He was really dependable and people could count on him to do the right thing. 'Corey was never in any trouble and just got on with his business. He loved to play football and was a key member of the Westlake team.' Gamble, who now lives in Beverly Hills and travels the world as part of Bieber's entourage, enrolled at Westlake High School in 1996. It is one of the top magnet schools Georgia with a strong academic and sports record. Black and white photos from the school's year books show a studious looking Gamble. Corey at  aged 18. Photo taken from Westlake school yearbook.  On Thursday, Kris took Corey to lunch with daughters Kourtney - who at 35 is two years older then her mother's new partner - and Khloe . Lap of luxury: Corey stretches out on the bed of a private plane . By his junior year at the school he matured somewhat and sported a faint moustache. As one of the 'jocks' at the school and with his good looks he had his fair share of female attention. 'Corey was considered quite a catch and there were plenty of girls from the cheerleading squad who fancied him,' said one former friend. 'The Westlake Football team were known throughout the state because of players who had gone on to the NFL. 'Anyone who made the team was considered something of a hero. Corey was a captain so that made him even more special.' While others in his graduating year of 1999 posed up for photographs in evening dress and black tie Gamble's photo is noticeably absent. He does appear in several photographs, including one where he is smiling as he walks with another student. Like many yearbooks parents sent in gushing words of love and praise about their son or daughter to be included in the final year book of their high school careers. Others sent in cute baby photos. There is no mention of Gamble in the 1999 book. Athlete Corey, aged 18, is in third row far left. He has the no.64 on his shirt . Staff at the school said it was likely he chose not to have his photograph featured in the year book. One friend said Gamble was always very focused on what he wanted to do after school and set his heart on college. He won a place at Morehouse College in Atlanta where former alumni include Martin Luther King, director Spike Lee and actor Samuel Jackson. A former college friend, who did not want to be named, said:'Corey was very proud to be at Morehouse. 'He loved the tradition of the college and all that it stood for.' Friends say he left for Los Angeles soon after graduating in 2003. While Gamble has an online presence on the LinkedIn site, his work career remains something of a mystery. He is reported to be part of the management team of Scooter Braun, Justine Bieber's manager, but does not appear on their website. Gamble clearly knows Bieber as there are numerous photographs of the pair together on his Facebook and Instagram pages. Attempts by MailOnline to speak with Gamble were met with silence - not surprising now that he is under the spell of Jenner who is known for her control of the Kardashian sisters and their multimillion dollar empire. The relationship became public knowledge last month when they shared a romantic dinner at Casa Vega. Hands on: The couple looked quite loved up when they returned to Los Angeles . Cheeky: At one point, Corey got up close and personal as he clasped Kris' hand near the reality star's rear . A report by an Atlanta blogger that the couple met in Spain appears to have been false with an 'imposter' posing as Gamble giving the interview to Sandra Brown. Other reports that he was aged 41 were also false,  with Gamble maintaining a discreet silence about his life and his relationship with Jenner,  who divorced her husband Bruce after 22 years of marriage earlier this year. Jenner felt comfortable enough about her new man to include him at daughter Kim Kardashian's 34th birthday party in Las Vegas. Happy: Kris was smiling broadly as she arrived to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians shoot in Beverly Hills on Thursday . They then set off to Mexico and stayed at Joe Francis' home Casa Aramara in Punta Mita. Gamble was also photographed at Van Nuys airport early Saturday with Jenner and her daughters after a night at Tao Las Vegas. 'Kris and Corey were cuddling,' a source told Us Weekly, and added Gamble was 'quite the gentleman' that evening. 'He walked her to the restroom,' the source said, and 'walked her out of Tao.' 'He seems very nice,' a source told People magazine. After Kim posted a photo of her mom and Gamble on her Instagram account it received more than 560,000 likes. Fans of the Kardashians wanted to know who 'guy next to Kris' was. Papa: Corey, who went to Morehouse College in Atlanta,  poses with his dad . Jenner has made no secret of her desire to move on from her second failed marriage, her first to Robert Kardashian also ending in divorce. During an interview with Giuliana Ranic she said: 'I want to definitely be in love. 'I like being in love. I think there's no better feeling in the world. So yeah, I mean, that would be amazing.' Gamble has said nothing yet about being linked with the most famous reality TV family in the world. He has yet to share any photos or thoughts on his social media accounts. Former classmates are delighted that he appears to have found love - although one questioned why he would date a woman so much older. 'Good luck to him, but it is not something that is going to last forever,' said the former classmate. 'I am sure he is enjoying being in the spotlight and he must be having fun.'","She's 59, he's 33, but age doesn't factor in for Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble .

"An actress who has had minor roles in The Sopranos and Law & Order is suing her former lover, an older, married multimillionaire for trying to evict her from a luxury Manhattan apartment. Ayelet Argaman, an Israeli singer, songwriter and actress, says her former boyfriend Robert Rothenberg is a vindictive 'scorned lover who has taken the break up badly,' according to papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. The 35-year-old says the 55-year-old real estate investor began wooing her in September 2013 and they started to date. Scroll down for video . Tension: Ayelet Argaman, (left) an actress who has had minor roles in The Sopranos and Law & Order is suing her former lover, Robert Rothenberg, (right) an older, married multimillionaire for trying to evict her . She claims he attempted to impress her this spring by buying a $1.3 million one-bedroom apartment in Trump Palace for her to live in on the Upper East Side, reports the New York Post. According to court papers he also furnished her with $1.3 million in other gifts, including  $100,000 a month for expenses. In April, Rothenberg signed an agreement giving her a 60 percent share of the holding company that owns the apartment, and the right to buy out his 40 percent share if their relationship did not last until May 2015. Famous friends: Argaman in a photo on Facebook with former president Bill Clinton in 2008 . Strike a pose: Ayelet Argaman with lawyer Andrew Barroway at the 2009 Angel Ball Benefit for Gabrielle`s Angel Foundation for Cancer Research in New York . But in June she broke up with him because of 'irreconcilable differences,' the filing says. Following their break-up, the Harvard MBA graduate threatened to sue her, claiming New York's 'heart-balm statute' requires her to return the gifts he gave her because they were made in contemplation of marriage, her suit says. Luxury: She claims he attempted to woo her by buying a $1.3 million one-bedroom apartment for her to live in Trump Palace (pictured) in NYC . But Argaman argues the law doe not apply in this case because Rothenberg was and still is married. 'An adulterer like Rothenberg cannot invoke an exception to the heart-balm statue — which is intended for single people actually engaged to be married — which was never the case here,' her suit says. The New York Daily News reports that Rothenberg, contends he was used. His planned suit claims he only bought the apartment and signed the deal after she duped him into thinking she would marry him. It also accuses her and her parents of trying to shake him down. Rothenberg's lawyer, Larry Hutcher, told The Post that many of the allegations in Argaman's suit are not true. He added that his client has a temporary order of protection from Nassau County Family Court that prevents Argaman from contacting Rothenberg or his family. Rothenberg is a 50 per cent partner and a managing member of Beachwold Residential. His company owns more than 8,000 apartment units in New York, Connecticut, Ohio, Florida, Louisiana and Texas.","Ayelet Argaman, 35, is an Israeli singer, songwriter and actress .

"Two Texas men have been arrested on animal cruelty charges after allegedly mutilating a horse so badly that she later died from wounds to her genitals and anus. Arturo Aleman, 63, and Erasmo Nunez, 55, reportedly tied up the  mare, named Yanaha, and cut off her genitals, before leaving her for dead in a field they owned near Gregory in San Patricio County. The five-year-old horse was rescued by Rockport Horse Rescue, which rushed her to veterinary hospital, where she underwent surgery to allow her to urinate and defecate.

Victim: The duo reportedly tied up the mare (pictured after the alleged mutilation and shortly before her death), named Yanaha, and cut off her genitals, before leaving her for dead in a field they owned near Gregory, Texas . Rescue workers also  spent six hours each day cleaning Yanaha - who was unable to lie down - and helping her evacuate feces. But despite their best efforts, the mare died several weeks later. Now, Aleman and Nunez have been booked into San Patricio County Jail on charges of cruelty to a livestock animal, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison. Following the alleged mutilation in August, the suspects told investigators the mare had become caught in a fence, causing her genitals to be ripped out, attorney Mike Welborn told KZTV. However, Michelle Hird, owner of Rockport Horse Rescue, who looked after Yanaha before she died, said the horse had been deliberately cut 'from her anus to down in between her legs'.

'She had some leg injuries, some of which we believe were from laying out in the field for weeks without treatment and others which we believe were from tying her up in order to mutilate her.' Describing Yanaha's final days, Mrs Hird told KZTV: 'Watching her fight so hard to survive was hard. She was not a quitter. She wanted to live and she fought and fought.'

"These incredible photographs show free divers exploring the depths of the ocean, while coming scarily close to some of the water's most deadliest predators. The images are the work of Alex Roubaud and Alex Voyer, from Paris, France, who have been free diving as a hobby for the past 10 years. The French duo - both 36 - have travelled the world and delved into some of the most remote waters alongside potentially frightening creatures such as the great white shark. The breathtaking photographs taken by Alex Roubaud and Alex Voyer, show free divers exploring the depths of the ocean . Up close and personal: French duo Roubaud and Voyer have been free diving together for over 10 years . The two 36-year-olds have explored some of the most remote waters in the world, photographing extremely rare creatures . Alex Voyer said: 'Free diving is our passion, we have been doing it for about 10 years now. 'We just try to travel whenever we have some time and money. 'Sharks are generally shy and curious, we almost never feel afraid or nervous when we swim with them. Under the sea: The divers claim that they enjoy swimming with smaller fish because they tend to be quite interactive . Unbelievable encounters: Here, one of the deep sea divers is photographed alongside a gigantic whale shark . No fear! The divers are not afraid to get very close with great white sharks . 'We need to be very calm, but they are not the terrifying animals we imagine them to be, just a wild animal. 'Of course I can feel afraid in the ocean, especially when there is no visibility - even if there are no animals around. 'I think it is certainly due to the Jaws movie - but when the water is clear, there is absolutely no problem.' Alex Voyer says: 'Sharks are generally shy and curious, we almost never feel afraid or nervous when we swim with them' Voyer and Roubaud explain that while you need to be careful, great whites are not the terrifying creatures we imagine them to be . In fact, the two even attribute people's nervousness around the creatures to the Jaws film franchise . The divers do admit to being more afraid in dark water, but if the water is clear, they have no problems . The stunning collection of images were taken during trips to widespread locations, including the Maldives, Guadalup Island in Mexico, Azores Island and Colombia. And the pair have witnessed first hand the beauty of some of other, perhaps less dangerous, animals - including blue sharks, whale sharks, leopard seals and hordes of fish. Alex said: 'I do not know if I could pick a favourite animal - I like them all. I can have a great time playing with an octopus, or seeing a school of little fish.

Together, the pair have gone free diving in the Maldives, Guadalup Island in Mexico, Azores Island and Colombia . Wildlife fanatics: 'I don't know if I can pick a favourite animal,' Voyer says. 'I like them all!' 'But the big ones are certainly much more impressive, purely for their size. 'For example, though a whale shark is not really interactive, they are so big that they inspire a great force. Whereas some little fish can be much more interactive. 'Diving with marine mammals is great - it is almost like we can understand them.' 'Diving with marine mammals is great,' they say. 'It's almost like we can understand them.'

"The Afghan War veteran son of a Canadian MP has posted footage of himself with Kurdish fighters after travelling to Iraq to join their fight against the so-called Islamic State terror group. Dillon Hillier, 26, whose father Randy is a Progressive Conservative member of the Ontario provincial legislature, is one of around half a dozen Canadian veterans understood to have travelled to the region. Video posted online by the former professional soldier show him putting his training to good use by bandaging a Kurdish fighter who has been shot in the face during a clash with jihadis. Expeditionary force: Dillon Hillier stands with his arm around a Kurdish comrade in this picture taken from his Facebook profile. He is one of around six Canadian army veterans believed to joined Kurdish fighters . 'Hey take this wrap it around his head,' shouts Mr Hillier at a Peshmerga fighter watching him patching up his comrade, as gunfire rings out in the background. 'Like this, like this!' he tells the fighter. 'F***! He got hit in the face,' says Mr Hillier. 'You're going to be alright man, tell him he's going to be alright!' The video was posted to Facebook with a comment from Mr Hillier calling it the 'greatest day' of his life. 'I accomplished more good in those 20 hours than the previous 26 years of my life,' he said. 'I dragged a man who had been shot in the face to safety and patched him up, while many others stood around in shock. 'I am unsure if my actions saved his life but I truly hope so.' 'Hey take this wrap it around his head': Mr Hillier's video shows him helping a Peshmerga fighter bandage the face of a comrade injured in a battle with Islamic State militants somewhere in Iraq . 'Like this, like this!' he tells the fighter as he does his best to dress the injured man's wound . 'The greatest day of my life': Mr Hillier said he accomplished more good in 20 hours than in the past 26 years . Mr Hillier travelled to Iraq as part of a group calling itself the 1st North American Expeditionary Force, which is raising a military unit from Canadian and U.S. veterans to fight alongside Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria. The group's Facebook page later reported that the man who Mr Hillier helped to patch up did indeed survive his injury. 'I got put on this Earth to do one thing,' the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation quoted one of the men, who served in Afghanistan, as saying on condition of anonymity. 'I got this fire in me. I still want to soldier on.' A Canadian maple leaf insignia is worn alongside a Kurdish flag on the uniform of a 1st North American Expeditionary Force fighter. The group has formed to help Canadian veterans make their way to Iraq .

Canadian fighter jets joined U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq in October. The decision to join the campaign was followed by fatal attacks on two soldiers in Canada in October that police said were carried out independently by radical recent converts to Islam. Ian Bradbury, an organiser at the First North American Expeditionary Force was quoted in the National Post as saying the group provided logistical support to Mr Hillier, who flew to north-east Iraq's Kurdish late last month. 'As long as nobody's being trained here, as long as we're not forming any militia, it's all in bounds,' Mr Bradbury was quoted as saying. The paper quoted Mr Hillier as saying: 'I look at what I'm doing as no different than when thousands of Canadians went to fight the Germans in World War Two.' His parents, Randy and Jane Hillier, declined to confirm directly that he was in Iraq, but said in a statement reported by CBC: 'There are no words which can adequately describe how proud we are of our son Dillon, including his past service with the Canadian Armed Forces. While we have limited contact with Dillon, we do know he is safe and sound.'","Dillon Hillier is seen in a video bandaging the face of Peshmerga fighter .

"King Edward VIII sparked a constitutional crisis when he proposed to American socialite Wallis Simpson just a few months after he was handed the monarchy in 1936. The Prime Minster and many others opposed the union because Wallis had already been divorced once and was in the process of divorcing her second husband, so the King chose to abdicate instead of giving up his lover. But while he would have been dismayed at having to give up the throne, a racy nightdress that was worn by Wallis while the couple were in exile and is now up for auction shows she knew how to console him. King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 so he could marry divorcee Wallis. The couple were shunned in the UK, so spent next few years in France, where this sheer nightie was made by a French couture house. The pink silk chiffon night dress with black Chantilly lace is now up for auction. Wallis wore the pink silk chiffon nightie, lined with black Chantilly lace,  while the couple were in exile in France after Edward gave up the monarchy in 1936. It is so sheer there was nowhere to put a label, but experts say the delicate item is definitely French couture and even still has a faint whiff of her perfume on it. London-based auctioneer Kerry Taylor said the garment would make a great Christmas present for anyone wanting to impress the woman in their life. Wallis Simpson captured the heart of the Prince of Wales after they met in 1931. King Edward VIII sparked a constitutional crisis when he proposed to American socialite Wallis Simpson just a few months after he was handed the monarchy in 1936. Wallis  captured the heart of the Prince of Wales after they first met in 1931, but she was still married to her second husband at the time . After giving up the throne and marrying in 1937, the couple were shunned by polite society in the UK and forced to move to France. The couple lived in a grand home in Paris and the property and its contents was bought by former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed in the 1980s. Among the items was the nightdress that was bought by the current owner at a previous charity auction. To the outside world Wallis seemed incredibly elegant, but it was quite a hard elegance. She used to say, 'I'm not beautiful but I dress to make sure everyone looks at me and my husband and feel proud.' The anonymous owner is now selling it through Kerry Taylor Auctions in London with an estimate of £600. Miss Taylor said: 'Things like this are very rare and this is a very personal item. 'This is almost certainly French couture but it is unlabelled. 'It's incredibly beautiful, transparent, super feminine, bias cut and very slinky. 'Wallis Simpson had the very best bed linen and lingerie. Everything was the best of its kind, the best money could buy. Wallis and Edward stayed together until his death in 1972. When Wallis passed away in 1986, she was buried alongside him in the royal burial ground of Windsor Castle . She continued: 'She didn't have a lot to fill her time so shopping was a major occupation for her. 'To the outside world she seemed incredibly elegant, but it was quite a hard elegance. This nightdress shows the more vulnerable, softer, seductive side of Wallis Simpson. 'She used to say ""I'm not beautiful but I dress to make sure everyone looks at me and my husband and feel proud"". 'This could appeal to somebody who is interested in the Windsor story. 'But it's also the most beautiful couture nightdress with a wonderful history and it could make a great Christmas present for the seductress in someone's life.' The auction takes place on December 9. Wallis Simpson was already making waves in high society in the early 1930s, but even she could hardly have imagined at the turn of the decade that she would soon be responsible for one of the biggest constitutional crises ever in the Britain. When Wallis first met Prince Edward in January 1931, she was still happily married to her second husband Ernest. But the royal quickly became infatuated and three years later they had fallen in love and started a full-blown affair. At first, the relationship raised few concerns as Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies. But when Edward's father George V died in January 1936 and he chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that  the relationship had become serious. Edward made several attempts throughout 1936 to make Wallis his wife and keep the throne, but they were rejected by the British, Australian and South African Prime Ministers. They refused on two main points, firstly, because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees. While the British media held off from printing about the affair, many foreign news outlets had been covering the romance in detail since the beginning of the year. By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country to escape from the public attention. Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on December 13, 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VI. The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the June 3, 1937 in the south of France. Edward was made Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', but his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.' The couple stayed together until Edward's death in 1972. When Wallis passed away in 1986, she was buried alongside Edward in the royal burial ground of Windsor Castle.","King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 so that he could marry divorcee Wallis .

"A woman was left feeling ‘hideous’ after an allergic reaction to hair dye triggered severe rosacea and her skin erupted in furious spots. Deborah Duffie, 33, had her hair dyed blonde at a salon after getting engaged to her fiancé, Chris. But hours later, she was rushed to A&E because her face and lips had swollen to twice their size. Doctors gave her steroid creams and antibiotics and said the redness would be temporary, but weeks later her skin was still stinging and covered in spots. She was diagnosed with rosacea, a skin condition which usually affects older women, as a result of an allergic reaction to the hair dye. Scroll down for video . Deborah Duffie, 33, suffered an allergic reaction to hair dye which triggered severe rosacea, a condition which left her skin red, sore and blotchy. Just months before her wedding and after becoming distressed over her skin, she was recommended a cream containing capers which cleared her skin within weeks . Mrs Duffie experienced soreness and redness at the slightest trigger for months. Having a glass of red wine, or going out in the cold could trigger a flare up, as could wearing make up or using products. Finally she found a cream which worked after tweeting a beauty blog. Here she is pictured, left and right, with clear skin . After using the caper-containing cream Mrs Duffie's skin cleared for her wedding day. Being able to look 'radiant' as she walked down the aisle was the 'best wedding present she could have asked for', she says . For months, her skin would burn hot and red after a glass of wine or going out into the cold and she thought about cancelling her upcoming wedding. Desperate for clear skin on her big day, she tweeted beauty blogs for advice. She eventually stumbled across a skin cream that contains an extract of capers, the salty green buds found in tartare sauce. The caper extract in the cream is said to have anti-inflammatory properties, and within three weeks the spots had subsided and her skin was less sensitive and red. Miraculously, by her wedding day just weeks later, her skin was ‘radiantly clear’ - something she described as the 'best wedding present ever’. Mrs Duffie, from Glasgow, said she was eventually told is was her hair dye that triggered the rosacea in the first place. She told MailOnline: ‘I had just got engaged and fancied a change so decided to get my hair highlighted. Naturally I am brunette. ‘I was delighted with my new blonde hair until I got home and my face started swelling up. 'Within a few hours I could barely see. My eyes were like two swollen eggs, my lips had swollen to almost double the size and I had red blotches all over my face and my skin was red hot.’ Rosacea is a common but poorly understood long-term skin condition that mainly affects the face. Symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing (where the skin turns red for a short period), but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as: . Rosacea is a relapsing condition, which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad, followed by periods when the condition is less severe. Many of the symptoms of rosacea can be controlled to a degree with treatment. But the changes to  physical appearance that may occur as a result of the condition can still have a significant psychological and social impact. It affects how a person feels about themselves and how they interact with others. ‘In panic, we rushed into A&E as I was worried the swelling wasn’t going to stop and that maybe my skin would split as my face was stinging like crazy.' Mrs Duffie was told she had suffered a severe reaction to the hair dye. Doctors gave her steroid injections to try and calm the swelling and she was eventually sent home with a course of antibiotics and tablets to take for two weeks. Although the doctors said the reaction was bad, they added it would be temporary. But after a week, while the swelling had subsided, her face was still red, blotchy and very sore. She said: ‘My skin kept flaring up red and I had developed small furious spots all over my cheeks, nose and chin. 'Before the hair dye reaction I’d always had lovely skin, I was devastated' For months the symptoms persisted and she could no longer put products she’d used for years on her face for fear it would cause a flare-up. She said: ‘Anything would trigger it from a hot room to wind or a glass of wine. My skin seemed totally out of control. ‘I started reacting to almost every skin cream or cosmetic I put on my face, ones I had been using for years with no problems. ‘Now they would make my skin sting and go furiously red and blotchy. ‘I knew there was something seriously wrong with my skin but I didn’t realise it was such a serious condition.’ Eventually, Mrs Duffie went to her doctor who immediately diagnosed her with rosacea as well as hyper sensitivity of the skin. He said the hair dye reaction had triggered full blown rosacea even though she was relatively young to have it. Usually rosacea effects women in their 40s and 50s. Miss Duffie (right) was trying out a new blonde hair colour in celebration of her engagement to fiancé Chris (left). They were at a black tie dinner at the Grosvenor Hotel in London when her face began to swell up . Mrs Duffie had experimented with her hair colour when she was younger. She is pictured here, left, with blonde hair. She had decided to dye her hair blonde again in preparation for her wedding . She was prescribed a steroid cream to put on her skin, which worked well for six months, before the rosacea came back with a vengeance. Her doctors warned long-term use of the steroid cream could damage her skin permanently. Mrs Duffie said: ‘By this time I was becoming panicked as I was due to get married in a few months and my skin was getting worse and worse,’ she recalls. ‘I imagined myself in my wedding photos with this bright red spotty skin and it made me feel like cancelling the whole thing. ‘I was desperate to find something other than steroids that could help with my skin.’ She tried an array of cosmetics, from nappy cream to Vaseline, but northing worked. ‘Most products burned my skin and made the redness worse and I had had to resort back to the steroid cream to control my skin, as a result. ‘Some products dried out dry my skin so badly it started to flake off. It was a vicious circle. Nothing really works on the redness, which was almost always there, even with the steroid cream.’ Her fiancé Chris was very supportive, but was upset as he could see how distressed she became as their wedding day crept closer and closer. It was a traumatic incident in a brideswear shop that triggered her to find products that wouldn’t inflame her skin. She said: ‘One day when I went shopping for my wedding dress with my mum and bridesmaids my face went so red I had to abandon my dress fitting and sit down in a café with ice cubes on my face.’ ‘I got home and decided I just had to stop using everything on my skin even if it meant looking dreadful. Mrs Duffie says she hopes her story will give hope to rosacea sufferers who are searching for treatments for the condition. Here, she is pictured with clear skin after using the Skin Shop's KALME range . ‘I felt my skin had just had enough and it was reacting to everything I put on it. When I stopped the steroid cream completely my skin erupted. I looked hideous.’ In desperation, she tweeted beauty blogs to see if anyone had a remedy for rosacea without chemicals in it. She stumbled across the Skin Shop’s KALME products after someone tweeted her back and recommended it. ‘It’s been the best bit of advice I’ve ever had,’ she said. KALME skincare contains a patented caper extract called Derma Sensitive. Its manufacturers claim it can reduce skin redness and sensitivity by up to 70 per cent in four weeks, after carrying out a clinical trial of 20 people. This is because the caper-extract present in the product has anti-inflammatory properties, they claim, as proved by a Saudi Arabian study published in 1985. ‘Within three weeks the spots had started to subside and my skin was much less sensitive and red,' Mrs Duffie said. A study carried out in 1985 found capers -  used in KALME products - have anti-inflammatory properties . KALME claims its cream can help rosacea sufferers because it contains a blend of caper extracts called Derma Sensitive. A study published in 1985 showed that  caper buds offer anti-inflammatory activity and are almost as effective as a recognised anti-inflammatory compound called oxyphenbutazone, the study reported. Capers induced a 50 per cent reduction in inflammation, as opposed to 66 per cent for oxyphenbutazone. KALME tested its new formula on a panel of 20 people with sensitive, reactive skin, prone to discomfort and redness. After four weeks, the volunteers reported improvements to their skin of between 10 to 70 per cent, compared with another calming ingredient called Bisabolol. KALME claims its range significantly reduces redness, decreases skin reactivity and improves skin comfort. Source: KALME . ‘My friends started commenting on how amazingly clear my skin looked.’ With her wedding just a few weeks away, she was delighted with the results. ‘Not only had the redness drastically reduced, my skin was virtually clear of spots and had stopped stinging.’ Mrs Duffie was able to celebrate her wedding day without the embarrassment of red skin. She said: ‘For my wedding day, my skin was radiantly clear, it was the best wedding present I could have asked for.' Now, she is able to wear make-up, but she gives her skin ‘breaks’ at weekends or when she goes on holiday. She hopes her story will give hope to rosacea sufferers who are searching for treatments for the condition. She said: ‘I’d recommend KALME to anyone with rosacea who feels a sense of despair that there is nothing that will help calm down their skin because I have discovered that there is.'","Deborah Duffie, 33, dyed her  hair blonde to celebrate her engagement .

"Kensington Palace officials were forced to announce the pregnancy early because Kate is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum . The country rejoiced when it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant again. But the spare is proving as troublesome for the Duchess as the heir – Kensington Palace officials were forced to announce the pregnancy early because Kate, right, is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum. I was quite troubled to see this referred to by some commentators as morning sickness. It’s not. Morning sickness is a very common symptom of pregnancy, affecting about half of all expectant mothers, and it ranges from mild nausea to daily vomiting. It isn’t pleasant but it certainly isn’t serious. Hyperemesis gravidarum, on the other hand, is brutal. Affecting only two per cent of pregnant women, the sickness is so severe that sufferers end up dehydrated and weak. This often results in hospital admission – as it did when Kate was carrying her first child – for intravenous fluids and heavy-duty anti-sickness drugs. Thankfully, in most cases the health of the baby is unaffected. The Royal couple are also said to be hiring a maternity nurse, who will live with mother and baby round-the-clock. William and Kate did not do the same for Prince George – but I say if you can afford it, go for it. Managing with sleepless nights is one of the hardest things to get used to as a parent, and it is not necessarily easier the second time around. Sleep deprivation is a bit like being run over by a five-ton truck every day. It is a big strain on both parents, and I admire the couple for coming up with a sensible strategy and admitting that they need help. Their lives are under constant scrutiny, and I hope they will not be judged unfairly for this move. WHY I'M FORCED TO REVEAL YOUR SECRETS . My mother, who is in her 90s, recently had food poisoning. Shortly after she recovered, our local council wrote to her and then called asking all sorts of questions about what she’d eaten and where. My concern is that her medical information was passed on to the council without her consent. I thought what happened between patient and doctor was confidential? I can reassure you that the experience your mother has had is entirely correct and permissible. Patient confidentiality is a right of every patient, as you say, and doctors have a strict responsibility to uphold this. However, there are situations where confidentiality can be breached, such as in cases where protecting the health of the community overrides the individual right of a patient. Scroll down for video . Hyperemesis gravidarum often results in hospital admission as it did when Kate was carrying her first child . A doctor is required by law to report cases of any disease capable of starting an epidemic – such as serious food poisoning – immediately to the local public health team. This gives the authorities a much greater chance of preventing the spread. Some diseases are unlikely to cause an epidemic but reveal a breakdown in hygiene that needs investigation. Notifiable diseases are usually those that spread rapidly and are difficult to treat, or those that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of vaccine programmes. The list includes 30 infections, among them measles, scarlet fever, TB – and even plague. The full list can be found on the gov.uk website. As a GP, it is my statutory duty to report these diseases even when they are only suspected, rather than confirmed. The principle is to ensure that an outbreak is contained. Speed is of the essence and, in order to facilitate this, a GP is obliged to provide full personal details to officials in the patient’s local authority area. Those officials are then able to contact the patient directly so that appropriate action can be taken to control or prevent further infection. I have chronic bronchitis and although I’m not able to walk far, I do try in order to keep fit. My oxygen levels are normal but I still suffer from a lot of pain in my chest. I already use three different inhalers and my doctor says there’s nothing more he can do. Is there anything that you could suggest? Three million people in the UK are estimated to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, encompassing lung conditions including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. They all cause narrowing of the airways in the lung and a debilitating, progressive condition that interferes with normal breathing and exercise tolerance as you describe. Smoking is the main cause and if you are a smoker, quitting is the most important thing. Stopping smoking can prevent the disease from worsening. Your GP can offer you all forms of nicotine-replacement or tablets on prescription. Inhalers are not easy to use and many COPD sufferers have poor technique, which leads to them being less effective. A practice nurse will, if asked, check your technique and offer help. The next step of treatment once inhalers are at a maximum level could be tablet therapy. It is also crucial to discuss with your GP something called pulmonary rehabilitation, a type of physical and educational treatment specifically for COPD sufferers who feel disabled by their condition. Anyone in this situation who suffers chest pains should make sure their GP knows. The pain can be a symptom of COPD but also a sign of heart disease, and cardiology investigations may be needed alongside the respiratory treatments. HAS CANCER MOTHER LAURA PAID £80,000 FOR FALSE HOPE? Are NHS doctors keeping life-saving treatments from young mothers dying of cancer? The story of Laura Fischer-Beards, apparently saved last week by US surgeons after being refused NHS treatment for an ‘inoperable’ brain tumour, suggests they are. Mother-of-three Laura was given 12 months to live, but now has had an £80,000 ‘pioneering procedure’, reported to have extended her life by as much as 15 years. Of course I’m pleased for her. But the story is full of half-truths. Laura Fischer-Beards  was given 12 months to live, but now has had an £80,000 ‘pioneering procedure' She suffers from grade two glioma – a slow-growing, difficult and unpredictable cancer. Typically, patients live for between five and 15 years from diagnosis. Laura had already had radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. And the procedure she paid for, awake mapping craniotomy, is offered on the NHS. But she’d suffered a stroke during the first surgery. Surgery would carry a huge risk of permanent disability and offer no guarantee she would live longer, as it’s almost impossible to remove all the cancerous cells, which don’t show up on scans. American doctors agreed to operate and say they removed ‘100 per cent of the enhanced tumour’. This sounds as if they’ve cured her, doesn’t it? Not so. This is medical terminology for: ‘We’ve got all we can see on the scans.’ Perhaps the operation has bought her more time. But she may well have lived as long or longer had they done nothing. It’s difficult to accept that watching and waiting can be as good as – or better than – ‘battling’ cancer. I recently read Do No Harm, by British neurosurgeon Henry Marsh. His more experienced self recognises that not operating often results in the same clinical outcome and life expectancy. Laura’s UK doctors would have operated if they thought it would benefit her. And beware false hope. The cruel part is not that she has spent £80,000 – it is what she seems to think she has been given for her money. I was furious when told about the case of a depressed patient forced by their boss to take time off for psychotherapy as paid holiday. The Chief Medical Officer’s latest report focuses on mental health, particularly the huge toll mental illness takes on our workforce. It states that 17 million working days are lost each year due to stress, depression and other mental health problems, costing Britain up to £100 billion annually. But that figure completely misses the huge and far more significant personal costs such issues cause to individuals and their families. Sadly, I see the problem workers face trying to access therapy – long waiting times and availability only during office hours. And although the example I’ve detailed is extreme, not to mention illegal, more options should be open to all patients that will keep them living as normal a life as possible. The Chief Medical Officer suggests fast-tracking workers ahead of others into therapy to improve the situation. But that would just create a two-tiered system, going against the principles of the NHS. It would far better to legislate to ensure that employers build mental health support into the core of their working practices. That would help improve the situation before individuals have even reached their GP’s surgery.","Kate Middleton is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum .

"Pat Preston, 65, of Whickam in Gateshead used to be prim and polite but she now can't stop swearing after a stroke she suffered in January . Grandmother Pat Preston used to think of herself as a was a prim and proper woman. The nature of her job as a bank customer service adviser demanded she was extremely polite and well-mannered. But now the 65-year-old can't help but swear like a trooper  after suffering a stroke that changed her personality. Mrs Preston,  of Whickam in Gateshead shocked her husband Michael, 66, by letting rip a stream of four-letter worlds in front of her doctors, in the presence of friends. And she has even called her young grandchildren 'little b*****s'. The change was brought about by a stroke she suffered in January. It left Mrs Preston unable to control her feelings, blurting out swear words when prior to her stroke she would've refrained from vocalising her thoughts. She now has a 'swear box' in which she adds money after using inappropriate words, and is working with a psychologist to come to terms with the changes. Mrs Preston said: 'Before I had a stroke I would still get annoyed at things but I could control my upset, however now I just can't help it. 'I can swear during conversations and a couple of weeks ago my grandchildren were playing up and I called them 'little b*****s'. 'My husband gets annoyed because he's a retired headteacher and gets horrified sometimes at what I say. I can get a little nervous too about what language I might use. 'If something really annoys me I am not able to keep my thoughts to myself and I'm quite outspoken. 'If I go into a shop and don't like how the assistants are reacting to me or even someone else I will say so. 'I was not aware that a stroke could affect someone in this way and change their personality. My close family and friends still can't quite accept that I've had a stroke.' Scroll down for video . Mrs Preston had just enjoyed a weekend of birthday celebrations in January and was in a shopping centre in Gateshead when she began to feel unwell, coming over faint, with a headache and sweating. She immediately called her husband, but was so breathless she could not get her words out. Yet it was only when got home and found she couldn't move her legs to get out of the car that the emergency services were called. Mrs Preston was taken to Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital where she was assessed and treated by specialists. She remained in the combined stroke unit for more than six weeks. Her home has since been adapted and Mrs Preston now relies on walking sticks to get around. Mrs Preston said her husband Michael, 66, a retired headteacher was shocked after she swore in front of doctors, in the presence of friends and even called her young grandchildren 'little b*****s' 'I would be telling lies if I said that there is not a time each day that I don't think about what happened and the impact it's had on my life,' she said. 'But I have to accept what has happened and move forward the best that I can as you only get one life. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. This can damage or change parts of the brain, which is known to cause a whole variety of neuropsychological and behavioral changes. Depression is the most common, but stroke has also been known to cause uncontrollable laughing or crying or neglect syndrome, in which people don't recognise one side of their visual field. Last year a Brazilian man developed what doctors have called pathological generosity, after a stroke damaged parts of his brain, causing his behaviour to change. The 49-year-old began to give away money, food and drinks excessively and even quit his corporate job because he felt he could no longer work there following his personality change. Doctors said the stroke disrupted the part of his brain related to higher thinking and decision making. 'I am about 75 per cent back to what I was like before the stroke. I feel very lucky that I can carry on with my life as I am and you have got to see the funny side of things or it would get you down.' Mrs Preston is receiving help from psychologists to come to terms with the changes in her life and has been able to regain movement to her affected left side thanks to working with occupational therapists. Specialist stroke nurse Marie Twentyman, who works at Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said: 'Patients can have a change of personality following a stroke. 'Sometimes words get mixed up in the brain and vocabulary that would not normally be used by a patients is. 'Stroke affects everyone differently. 'When Pat was on the ward you could see that she would become frustrated as she had been so independent before, and it was when she became tired and frustrated that she would use language that she would not normally have used. 'It is very important that if anyone is suspected to have suffered a stroke that they seek medical treatment quickly so that treatment can be given as soon as possible.' On Saturday, Pat is hosting a charity event to raise funds for Ward 22 at the QE Hospital to thank staff for the care she received. She hopes to raise more than £500 to purchase six personal DVD players for patients, and Lloyds TSB in Gateshead has agreed to match donations up to £500.

"She's fashion's most famous editor with 25 years at style bible Vogue under her belt. So it is not surprising that Anna Wintour took home the Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2014 British Fashion Awards on Monday night. The iconic editor-in-chief of American Vogue and artistic director of Condé Nast was honoured during the ceremony at the London Coliseum  for her contribution to the fashion industry. Anna Wintour, pictured at the British Fashion Awards, took home the Outstanding Achievement Award . Speaking to MailOnline about winning the award, she said: 'Obviously I am thrilled and honoured to be here tonight receiving an award. 'I am a great believer in British fashion and just so thrilled to come to my first awards.' Anna was on top table at the awards, in between her daughter Bee Shaffer and photographer Mario Testino. She was also joined by fashion's most famous couple, Victoria and David Beckham, and model-of-the-moment Suki Waterhouse. Fashion's finest: (L to R) Cara Delevingne, Tallulah Harlech, Bee Shaffer, Anna Wintour and Victoria Beckham celebrated at last night's fashion awards . When the fashion guru's award was announced, Victoria, one of her biggest fans, cheered loudly, while Cara Delevingne raised her hands in the air in support of the industry heavyweight. So close have Anna and Victoria, 40, become that Anna even acknowledged the British designer in her acceptance speech, where she cited her as one of the country's greatest talents. Anna may have worked with the world's most esteemed models and designers and organised the Met Gala - showbiz's starriest night - but her career highlight? Being celebrated by Michelle Obama. Speaking about her fashion highlights, she said: 'One of the most wonderful things that happened to me this year was having the costume centre at the Metropolitan Museum named in my honour and having the First Lady open it for me.' Family first: Anna, is a great believer in British fashion, was joined on the red carpet by daughter Bee Shaffer . Friends in high places: Anna has become incredibly close with David and Victoria Beckham . Mingling: Anna caught up with Nicole Scherzinger and Formula 1 poster boy, Lewis Hamilton . So who is the woman behind the black sunglasses, pageboy bob and frosty demeanour? First, she's a stellar businesswoman. Anna, now 65, is the daughter of Charles Wintour, the famed then-editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper nicknamed 'Chilly Charlie', and philanthropist Elinor Wintour. Clearly keen for independence, Anna dropped out of her pretentious finishing school and moved to London where her  career began at Harpers & Queen magazine in London in 1970. In 1983 she joined Condé Nast as creative director of American Vogue and in 1986 returned to England to become editor in chief of British Vogue. In July 1988 she rejoined American Vogue in her current position. In March 2013, Anna was named the artistic director of Condé Nast. Speaking about her hopes for the glossy fashion bible she's made her own, Anna told the Telegraph at the time: 'I want Vogue to be pacy, sharp, and sexy, I'm not interested in the super-rich or infinitely leisured. Mother and mentor: Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Magazine Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer attend The Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit: A Tribute to Tilda Swinton reception . Friends in high places: Anna sat front row at Victoria Beckham's show with David and Brooklyn, left, and, right, with the designer she has long supported . 'I want our readers to be energetic, executive women, with money of their own and a wide range of interests. 'There is a new kind of woman out there. She's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how.' She did just that. Garnering enough financial backing to revitalise the magazine (which was losing out in the figures to Elle), she restored it to glory. She spearheaded using celebrities on her covers and mixing up designer and high street fashion. The September 2004 edition, under her editorship, had 832 pages, which is the most ever for a monthly magazine. She is also responsible for founding the careers of esteemed designers such as Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen. Fashion friends: Anna mingles regularly with the likes of Chanel maestro Karl Lagerfeld, left, and Rolling Stones heartthrob Mick Jagger, right . She is also hugely charitable and uses her name for the good. She has been actively involved in fundraising, particularly for Aids research and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1990, she played a strategic role in developing the fashion industry’s Aids charity, the CFDA/Vogue initiative through which she helped raise over $20m (£12.6m). From 1995 to today, Anna has co-chaired 16 fundraising galas which together have raised nearly $130m (£82m) for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. In 2003, she directed the establishment of the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, an unprecedented initiative and award designed to aid emerging American fashion designers struggling to build successful businesses in the wake of 9/11. Pride of place: We are most accustomed to seeing Anna on the front row of the best fashion shows with her sunglasses on and a straight face . TV star: In 2000 she starred in Boss Women - a documentary profile which offered compelling portraits of Britain's most powerful women . In September 2009, in response to the devastating consequences of the economic downturn, she developed Fashion’s Night Out, a global initiative designed to promote the retail industry, restore consumer confidence and celebrate fashion. In 2014, she spearheaded the fashion industry’s involvement in Born Free Africa, an organisation aiming to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV by the end of 2015, using funds from a dedicated clothing line comprised of pieces by world-renowned fashion designers who are also mothers. She has since involved Victoria Beckham in the charity. Wintour, who is famously good pals with Roger Federer and starts each day with a game of tennis, has also thrown herself into politics. In February 2012, she co-hosted a fundraising event for President Barack Obama with actress Scarlett Johansson. As for her personal life, she divorced David Shaffer, with whom she has two children with, and now resides in New York with long-time boyfriend, investor Shelby Bryan. The fashion world have come together to hail her success after the news was announced. Here's what they have to say... Christopher Bailey MBE, Burberry Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, said: 'Anna gives an extraordinary amount of her time nurturing and supporting creative talent around the world whether they are emerging or established names, part of fashion, literature, theatre, film, politics, sport or philanthropy. 'Her contribution to all of our global industries is a testament to both her passion, and her innate generosity. On a personal level it has also been a tremendous honour to have had her support, guidance and friendship throughout the many years that I have known her and I'm delighted that we are celebrating her at the British Fashion Awards in London.' Christopher Kane: 'Anna Wintour is awe-inspiring; her dedication and passion to the fashion industry, her work ethic, and her unwavering support of young talent are truly unique. I owe so much to Anna for believing in me since the very beginning; without her loyal support and friendship over the past 10 years I would not be where I am today.' Sarah Burton OBE, Creative Director of Alexander McQueen: 'Anna has such an influential hand in fashion, she cares about, and pioneers creativity. Her love and contribution to British fashion is truly outstanding and I am ever grateful for all the support she has given me.' Natalie Massenet MBE, Chairman of the British Fashion Council: 'Anna Wintour has helped, nurtured and advised the careers of some of the world's most brilliant and creative designers. There isn't a person working in fashion who has not been inspired and influenced by Anna's leadership. 'This is why we are honouring Anna at this year's British Fashion Awards. An editor, business woman, philanthropist, mother, friend and icon; this award recognises and celebrates her extraordinary contribution to the global fashion industry and to popular culture. 'Anna is the creative industry ambassador and a great friend to the British fashion industry, which has benefited from her incredible support in driving the profile of our talent on a global platform as well as from her very personal care and attention. 'As one of Britain's most successful exports, it is fitting to celebrate Anna Wintour's lifetime of achievement in London.'","Anna, 65, took home Outstanding Achievement Award .

"It might seem like just yesterday that an 18-year-old Britney Spears burst onto the music scene wearing a schoolgirl outfit in her Baby One More Time video. However, the pop singer is today celebrating her 33rd birthday. From that red jumpsuit for Oops I Did It Again, to the matching denim ensemble she and then boyfriend Justin Timberlake wore to the American Music Awards in 2001, the mother of two is renowned for having some of the best - and worst - outfits in pop history. Scroll down for video . Happy Birthday Britney! As the singer turns 33 her best and worst outfits are revealed . Britney's first iconic outfit was the schoolgirl costume she wore in the Baby One More Time video . Britney wore a pink crop with matching embellished trousers at the Universal Ampitheater for her Baby One More Time tour in 1999 . Britney’s sartorial choices have had her fans in awe for more than 15 years. Never one to shy away from flashing the flesh, she's often seen writhing around on stage in crop tops and tiny hotpants. And who can forget the bejewelled nude jumpsuit she wore for her Toxic video in 2003 – a look which Britney once described as her ‘personal favourite'? Of course, there have been many hits – Britney looked stunning at Elton John’s 2013 Oscar’s party in a plunging sequin gown. And many misses – her 2002 VMA’s leather look outfit would have been more at home in an S&M club than on the red carpet. But when it comes to fashion, Britney says that if she had her time over she ‘wouldn’t do anything differently'. Lady in red: In the Oops I Did It Again video Britney wore THAT infamous red leather look jumpsuit . Alright in white: One of her early fashion triumphs Britney looked sleek as she attended the Grammies in 2000 . Matchy matchy: Who can forget when Britney and her then boyfriend Justin Timberlake showed up to the American Music Awards in 2001 in matching denim outfits? Love's young dream: Britney and Justin were one of pops most iconic couples dating from 1999 to 2002 . It's a bit S&M: When Britney introduced Michael Jackson at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards . Top of the crops: Britney looked Happy recording a video in New York in 2004 in a sequin crop top . However, the singer admits that when it comes to her down time, she prefers a casual look to her out-there on stage outfits. She once revealed: ‘I love my jeans and my sweats - I’m really just a tomboy at heart. So it’s really hard for me to be like Kim Kardashian and be makeup- and hair-ready every time I go out of my house. ‘I’m not a believer in that, you know? On the other hand, when you do wear those sweats, you’re like, ""Oh God, I should step it up a notch"".’ All about the hats: Britney wore a selection of dodgy headgear in 2007 to promote her new album, Blackout . Sparkling performance: Some of Brit's stage costumes, like this pink leotard, leave little to the imagination . Just like her wardrobe choices, Britney's career has been full of ups and downs. After leaving the squeaky clean Micky Mouse Club, which she joined in 1992, to pursue a career in pop, Britney saw huge success with her first four albums. However, during 2006 and into 2007 Britney began to go off the rails. The singer suffered from a number of mental health issues and was hospitalised on more than one occasion. Britney wowed fans with her amazing body in the Toxic video when she wore a jewelled nude jumpsuit . Watch that whip! For her 'The Circus Starring Britney Spears' tour the singer had a ring leaders outfit made . Hell for leather: In 2011 Brit performed on Good Morning America in a VERY tight latex outfit . In January 2008, she was again taken into care and was committed to the psychiatric ward of the Ronald Raegan UCLA Medical Center. Her two children with dancer Kevin Federline - Jayden James and Sean - were put under the care of her father Jamie Spears. Since then Britney has worked hard to rebuild her life, and although her father still has a conservatorship over her, she has gone on to once again enjoy huge success. She has even launched her own lingerie line named Intimate Britney Spears. In 2013 she began a Las Vegas residency which will run until September 2015. The perfect opportunity for her to show off more of her fabulous (and freaky) outfits. Super chic: Nowadays Britney prefers to rock a more demure look like this one shoulder LBD .

"Famous 'Jackass' stuntman and bad boy Steve-O is facing a traffic citation for his latest stunt. Stephen Gilchrist Glover, 40, or 'Steve-O,' posted a YouTube video of his latest prank. The video showed Steve-O climbing up a freeway sign in San Diego to attach a banner that read 'sucks' after the words 'SeaWorld' on the sign, Fox 5 reports. The incident occured in May, but the prankster's identity remained unknown until Steve-O uploaded the YouTube video in August, according to the LA Times. Steve-O: Steve-O, 40, is facing a traffic citation for climbing a San Diego freeway sign and attaching a banner that said 'sucks' after the words 'SeaWorld' Steve-O was charged with  an infraction of California's vehicle code -- comparable to a speeding ticket. Officials say his stunt put 'drivers and their passengers in harm’s way,' Fox reports. City officials said Caltrans could seek reimbursement because the vandalism damaged the sign. In September, California Highway Patrol made a statement saying they recommended charges of trespassing and vandalism to the district attorney's office, the Times reports. But, the animal rights activist is being forced to pay a $239 fine or go to traffic court, according to Fox. Attempts: Steve-O's prank is carried out over a course of two days with several failed attempts . First: During his first attempt, Steve-O has trouble climbing a rope and ends up strung upside down by his foot. In September, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals agreed to pay any fine assessed for the stunt, according to NBC. 'Steve-O isn't the only one who realizes that SeaWorld sucks,' Lisa Lange, PETA senior vice president, told the Times, 'and the highway sign needs to come down.' When the CHP issued its request, Steve-O took to Instagram to voice his opinion. He wrote: 'The California Highway Patrol has requested that the District Attorney file charges against me for helping out this sign. Bring on the publicity, because #SeaWorldSucks #yeahdude #freesteveo.' 'SeaWorld': At the end of the video, Steve-O, who has posed for PETA public service campaigns, yells, 'If doing that was wrong, I don't want to be right. Screw you, SeaWorld' At the beginning of the video, Steve-O says 'I'm putting my foot down for Shamu' before making the two-day attempt to climb the freeway sign and attach the 'sucks' banner. After a few failed attempts, Steve-O enlists the help of a few more men to help him complete his task. After another failed attempt, he buys a latter and is soon standing victoriously on the sign's platform with his fists in the air, having successfully attached the sign. At the end of the video, Steve-O, who has posed for PETA public service campaigns, yells, 'If doing that was wrong, I don't want to be right. Screw you, SeaWorld.' The video has received more than a million views since its upload.","Steve-O, 40, is facing a traffic citation for climbing a San Diego freeway sign and attaching a banner that said 'sucks' after the words 'SeaWorld'

"Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking yesterday in the House of Commons, . London, warned the UN report into Iran's nuclear ambitions could spark a . regional arms race . Israel will launch military action to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon as soon as Christmas, intelligence chiefs have warned. A report by a UN watchdog into Iran’s nuclear ambitions ‘completely discredits’ the Islamic nation’s protestations of innocence, according to Foreign Secretary William Hague. The International Atomic Energy Agency found that Iran is developing a nuclear test facility, nuclear detonators and computer modelling for a nuclear warhead that would fit on an existing missile. Sources say the understanding at the top of the British Government is that Israel will attempt to strike against the nuclear sites ‘sooner rather than later’ – with logistical support from the U.S. A senior Foreign Office figure has revealed that ministers have been told to expect Israeli military action, adding: ‘We’re expecting something as early as Christmas, or very early in the new year.’ Officials believe President Barack Obama would have to support the Israelis or risk losing vital Jewish-American support in the next presidential election. In recent weeks, Ministry of Defence sources confirmed that contingency plans have been drawn up in the event that the UK decided to support military action. But the source ruled out direct British support, adding: ‘Of course we are not in favour of Iran developing a bomb – but do we think they’d use it: no. ‘The bigger concern is it will be impossible to stop Saudi Arabia and Turkey from developing their own weapons.’ Mr Hague said Britain would push for more sanctions against Tehran when the IAEA committee meets later this month. Meeting the masses: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad waves to supporters while visiting the city of Shahrekord, of Tehran. He vowed that Iran will not retreat 'one iota' from its nuclear programme . All smiles: Ahmadinejad hit out at the IAEA, saying it is discrediting itself by siding with 'baseless' U.S. claims that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons . Iran’s president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, meanwhile, vowed not to retreat ‘one iota’ from its nuclear programme. In a statement on Middle Eastern affairs, the Foreign Secretary was critical of Israel’s ‘occupation’ of Palestinian land. But he announced Britain will abstain on a UN vote later this week to give statehood to Palestinians. In its latest report on Iran, the UN . International Atomic Energy Agency outlines the sum of its knowledge on . the Islamic Republic's alleged secret nuclear weapons work, including: . Yesterday the . Iranian president gave a passionate speech to thousands of supporters . in central Iran, and broadcast on live state television, denouncing the UN report. He hit out at the IAEA, saying it is discrediting itself by siding with . 'baseless' U.S. claims that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. The U.S. has yet to . comment on the findings, but France said it is ready to . push for sanctions of 'an unprecedented scale' if Iran refuses to answer new questions about its nuclear programme. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that if Iran fails to answer concerns raised by the . report, the international community should raise diplomatic pressure to a . new level. China isn't publicly commenting yet on the . U.N. assessment in a likely sign that it . will wait for Washington and Moscow to signal their intentions. Foreign . Ministry spokesman Hong Lei yesterday said that Beijing is studying . the report and repeated calls for dialogue and co-operation. Speaking to supporters in the city of Shahrekord, Ahmadinejad said Iran will not stop . its nuclear development, adopting a defiant position against the . report, which could spur efforts for new sanctions against his country. He said: 'If you think you can change the . situation of the world through putting pressures on Iran, you are deadly . wrong. The Iranian nation will not withdraw an iota.' Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not weapons production. Ahmadinejad's . regime is already thought to have built a top-secret explosives test . facility at a site in Parchin, just outside Tehran, where it is . conducting experiments to develop a weapon. Scientists . are building hi-tech precision detonators which would be essential for a . nuclear device, and developing a uranium core for a nuclear warhead, . the UN said. Spreading the word: Ahmadinejad is adopting a defiant position against the report, which could spur efforts for new sanctions against his country . Nationalism: Supporters of Ahmadinejad wave flags during his speech in Shahrekord . The report . also lays bare that Iranian scientists are trying to mount a nuclear . payload into their Shahab 3 missiles - which can reach Israel, Iran’s . arch foe. The report compiled by Yukiya Amano is the strongest sign yet that Iran seeks to build a nuclear arsenal, despite Tehran's insistence its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes. The . document claims that while some of the suspected secret nuclear work by . Iran can have peaceful purposes, 'others are specific to nuclear . weapons.' A 13-page . attachment to the agency's Iran report details intelligence and IAEA . research that shows Tehran working on all aspects of research toward . making a nuclear weapon, including fitting a warhead onto a missile. Ahead of the report's release, . Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak warned of a possible Israeli . military strike against Iran's nuclear programme. He . told Israel Radio that he did not expect any new U.N. sanctions on . Tehran to persuade it to stop its nuclear defiance, adding: 'We continue . to recommend to our friends in the world and to ourselves, not to take . any option off the table.' The . 'all options on the table' phrase is often used by Israeli politicians . to mean a military assault. Iran is also pursuing its nuclear weapons programme at the Parchin military base about 30 kilometres from Tehran, diplomatic sources in Vienna say . While . some of the suspected secret nuclear work outlined in the annex could . also be used for peaceful purposes, 'others are specific to nuclear . weapons', the report claims. Some of the information contained in . the annex was new - including evidence of a large metal chamber at a . military site for nuclear-related explosives testing. The bulk, however, was a compilation and expansion of alleged work already partially revealed by the agency. But a senior diplomat familiar with . the report said its significance lay in its comprehensiveness, thereby . reflecting that Iran apparently had engaged in all aspects of testing . that were needed to develop such a weapon. Also significant was the agency's . decision to share most of what it knows or suspect about Iran's secret . work with the 35-nation IAEA board and the U.N. Security Council after being . stonewalled by Tehran in its attempts to probe such allegations. Copies of the report went to board members and the council, which has . imposed four sets of U.N. sanction on Tehran for refusing to stop . activities that could be used to make a nuclear weapon and refusing to . cooperate with IAEA attempts to fully understand its nuclear program. Inspection: Ahmadinejad visits the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility in April 2008 . The nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran - a site that may be targeted in a mooted military strike . The agency said the annex was based on more than 1,000 pages of . intelligence and other information forwarded by more than 10 nations and . material gathered by the IAEA itself. The report suggests that Iran made computer models of a nuclear warhead . and includes satellite imagery of a large steel container the IAEA . believes is used for nuclear arms-related high explosives tests. In remarks broadcast on state . television, Ahmadinejad said that International Atomic Energy Agency . chief Yukiya Amano was simply repeating U.S. allegations. 'He delivers . the papers that American officials hand on him,' Ahmadinejad said. 'I am sorry that a person is heading . the agency who has no power by himself and violates the agency's . regulations, too.' He repeated Iran's stance that it is . not involved in making a nuclear weapon: 'They should know that if we . want to remove the hand of the U.S. from the world, we do not need bombs . and hardware. We work based on thoughts, culture and logic.'","Senior Foreign Office figure: ‘We’re expecting something as early as Christmas, or very early in the new year’"
"The style set is once again embracing a rather risqué take on the traditional tuxedo trend by wearing the low-cut style without anything on underneath. The look, which rose to fashion fame six years ago thanks to Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham, was seen on Rihanna and Emma Watson on the red carpet at the British Fashion Awards last night and has recently been worn by everyone from Cara Delevingne to Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence. While some stars choose to style the low-cut jacket by itself, accessorizing only with jewelry and a handbag as Rihanna did with her Stella McCartney design at the BFAs, other fans of the trend prefer to model a full tuxedo, as often worn by Cara and her fellow Burberry model Suki Waterhouse. Scroll down for video . Red carpet trend: Rihanna and Emma Watson opted for completely different tuxedo styles at last night's British Fashion Awards . Tux lux: Cara Delevingne (R) is a long-time fan of the low-cut look and has previously stepped out in a variety of tuxedo styles, including this burgundy Burberry number which she wore to a pre-BAFTA party, where pal Suki Waterhouse (L) also opted for a revealing jacket . All shapes and sizes: The tuxedo trend has been seen on a wide variety of celebrities, from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (L) to Gwyneth Paltrow (R) Harry Potter star Emma chose to team her Dior tuxedo jacket with a Misha Nonoo jumpsuit at last night's award ceremony, choosing a slightly more demure look than Rihanna's flesh-baring style. While Cara chose a beaded Burberry gown for her red carpet appearance at the star-studded event, at which she picked up the award for Model of the Year, the model-turned-actress has often made clear her fondness for the tuxedo trend in the past. During the past year, Cara has been spotted out and about sporting a number of tuxedo-style ensembles. Favoring Burberry's classic colored designs, the star wore a burgundy numebr at Harvey Weinstein's pre-BAFTA party in London - where she matched her look to close friend Suki Waterhouse, who also wore a Burberry design - before choosing a blue style to wear to Burberry's London Fashion Week show in September. Switching it up: J.Crew executive creative director Jenna Lyons is also a fan of the tuxedo trend . The style has also been seen on the likes of Jennifer Lawrence - who wore a black Dior tuxedo dress to the premiere of her film Serena at the BFI London Film Festival earlier this year - and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - who opted for a quirky zebra-print jacket when she stepped out at Paris Fashion Week in February. Meanwhile Gwyneth Paltrow styled her chic Tom Ford tux with a matching pair of trousers at the 2014 amfAR LA Inspiration Gala in October. It is not the first time that the low-cut look has been worn by such a variety of high-profile fashion icons. Designer Victoria Beckham, who picked up the coveted award for Brand of the Year at last night's ceremony, wore a sequined tuxedo jacket to attend Robert Cavalli's 2008 Milan Men's Fashion Week Show alongside her former Spice Girls bandmates. Number one fan: Cara has worn a number of different tuxedo styles during the last few months, including at an event in Paris (L) and at London Fashion Week (R) Shanghai style: The Burberry model also opted for a tuxedo when she attended a Burberry event in China . Former Disney star Miley Cyrus turned heads when she arrived at the 2012 American Music Awards wearing a revealing white tuxedo dress by designer Jean Paul Gaultier. But, while the popular trend has helped many stars to showcase the perfect amount of skin, the low-cut style in not without its risks. In March 2009, Kate Moss suffered an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction when she slipped out of her Yves Saint-Laurent jacket shortly after leaving Topshop mogul Sir Phillip Green's 57th birthday party in London.

"The world’s first enzymes made from artificial genetic material have been created by scientists in what could be a major step towards generating synthetic life. The enzymes, which do not occur naturally, were created using a synthetic form of DNA called XNA and were capable of triggering chemical reactions in the lab. The findings build on previous work that showed six types of XNA molecules were capable of storing and transmitting genetic information in the same way as DNA and RNA. It had been previously thought that DNA and RNA, which form the basis for all life on Earth, were the only way of storing genetic material. Double stranded DNA (above) and single stranded RNA were thought to be the only basic building blocks for life but scientists have shown that other molecules called XNAs can not only store genetic information but also catalyse biological reactions that are used to edit the genetic material within cells . But now the latest research by synthetic biologists in Cambridge shows that this synthetic genetic material is also capable of performing another crucial biological role - catalysing biochemical reactions that are essential for life. Using their lab-made XNAs as building blocks, the team were able to create synthetic enzymes, which they have named ‘XNAzymes’, that could cut up and stitch together small chunks of genetic material, just like naturally occurring enzymes. The suggests that such molecules could be used to replicate some of the earliest steps needed to produce life itself and may even provide clues about what life on other planets may be like. In truth, no body really knows, but the work conducted by scientists at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge can provide some clues. They were able to create sequences of XNA that they could use to hold genetic information, copy it into strands of DNA and then copy back to a new XNA. This is very similar to the behaviour of viruses, which transfer genetic information into cells, hijack the host DNA and then create more copies of themselves. However, if life on other planets used this approach, it would still require DNA to help them replicate. But the molecular machinery needed to do this would look unlike anything here on Earth. The researchers had to create a specially engineered enzyme to get this reaction to occur - one that does not occur anywhere in nature, on Earth at least. Yet the scientists have also created XNA molecules that can assemble and fold themselves up spontaneously - much like naturally occurring DNA. Their most recent work shows XNA can also behave like enzymes to trigger biochemical reactions. This raises the prospect that XNA could also begin to replicate itself, a crucial step in creating organisms. XNA has been shown to be far stronger and stable than DNA and so could result in life that is much more robust than here on Earth. However, the tiny errors and mutations that occur when DNA is damaged are also essential for driving evolution. This would mean that in an XNA-world, life would evolve far slower than on Earth and could still be fairly basic. It is thought that life first began with the evolution of a segment of RNA that was able to copy itself and catalyse reactions. If XNA is also capable of this, then it could also have led to different forms of life on other planets or could be used to create new synthetic forms of life. However, Dr Philipp Holliger, who led the research at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, said: ‘Our work suggests that, in principle, there are a number of possible alternatives to nature's molecules that will support the catalytic processes required for life. ‘Until recently, it was thought that DNA and RNA were the only molecules that could store genetic information and, together with proteins, the only biomolecules able to form enzymes. ‘Life's 'choice' of RNA and DNA may just be an accident of prehistoric chemistry. 'The creation of synthetic DNA, and now enzymes, from building blocks that don't exist in nature also raises the possibility that if there is life on other planets it may have sprung up from an entirely different set of molecules, and widens the possible number of planets that might be able to host life.’ In 2012 Dr Holliger’s group showed that there were six alternative molecules to the oligonucleotides that form RNA and DNA, which they called XNAs. They demonstrated that these could store information and could even evolve through natural selection. In their latest research, which is published in the journal Nature, the team created four different types of synthetic enzyme from strands of XNA. These XNAzymes were able to perform the role of a polymerase - an enzyme that cuts and joins RNA strands together - in a test tube. One of the XNAzymes they created was also able to join XNA strands together to form longer molecules - a key step towards creating a living system that can replicate itself. Although it will still be some time before these can be used to create living synthetic organisms, Dr Holliger believes that XNAzymes could also be useful for developing new therapies for range of diseases including cancers and some viral infections. Dr Holliger added: ‘Our XNAs are chemically extremely robust and, because they do not occur in nature, they are not recognised by the body's natural degrading enzymes. ‘This might make them an attractive candidate for long-lasting treatments that can disrupt disease-related RNAs.’ Professor Patrick Maxwell, chair of the MRC's Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board, said the work could kick start an entirely new branch of medicine. Two of the XNA enzymes created by the scientists at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, which were able to join two strands of XNA together (left) and cut up strands of RNA (right) Life on other planets outside our own solar system, like this exoplanet, could have evolved from XNA rather than RNA, which could have led to very different forms of life to those we are familiar with here on Earth . He said: ‘Synthetic biology is delivering some truly amazing advances that promise to change the way we understand and treat disease. ‘This latest advance offers the tantalising prospect of using designer biological parts as a starting point for an entirely new class of therapies and diagnostic tools that are more effective and have a longer shelf-life.’ Professor Jack Szostak, a Nobel prize winner at Harvard University who studies the origins of life, added that the research raises some fundamental questions about what life on other planets may be like. He told New Scientist: ‘The possibility that life elsewhere, on exoplanets, could have started with something other than RNA or DNA is quite interesting. ‘But the primordial biopolymer for any form of life must satisfy other constraints as well, such as being something that can be generated by prebiotic chemistry and replicated efficiently. ‘Whether XNA can satisfy these constraints, as well as providing useful functions, remains an open question.’","Synthetic form of DNA, called XNA, is capable of editing genetic material .

"He is the ‘Master of Movement’, capturing our sporting icons at work in drawings that explode from the page with vibrancy and colour. And now Paul Trevillion’s stellar 50-year career is being marked with an exhibition in central London, with dozens of familiar faces on display. Over the years, Trevillion has immortalised the likes of Pele, Bobby Moore, Cristiano Ronaldo, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Sir Ian Botham, Sachin Tendulkar and Andy Murray - to name but a few. A picture paints a thousand words: Paul Trevillion speaks at the launch of his exhibition with two of his masterpieces, portraits of Lionel Messi and Pele, hanging in the background . Mastered: Trevillion next to the picture of Pele bursting out of a haze of colour . And here's how I did it: Trevillion gives an insight into his genius as he talks about the Pele picture .

The studied expression of Moore - in that classic English red of 1966 - as he plays the ball from the back, the 60-yard glance of Beckenbauer as he carries West Germany forward in 1974, the look of elation on Paolo Rossi’s face as he scored for Italy in 1982. And, at the end of the corridor, the best of them all. Pele, bursting from the wall in a haze of vivid colour, playing to an incessant samba beat that entranced the world in 1970. The Brazilian icon appears upstairs as well, the jewel in the collection; a Pele portrait crafted in just 50 minutes in a swoosh of running inks, spun upside down at one point in the flash of creation but still ending in an uncanny likeness. It will set you back £50,000 but see it as a worthy investment. Elation: Paolo Rossi's emotion captured as he scores for Italy in 1982 and (right) the poise of Diego Maradona . Spectacular: Both the execution of Gerd Muller's overhead kick and the capturing of the moment . Modern heroes: Barcelona's Argentinian star Lionel Messi and (right) Cristiano Ronaldo, then of Man Utd . Elsewhere, the chapter of Genesis for Trevillion; sketches from the Roy of the Rovers comic strips. Roy Race and his Melchester team-mates looking as magical now as they did back in 1963. Fans of a certain age who lapped up Roy’s adventures on a weekly basis now have the opportunity, for the first time, to own an original sketch or proof from this immensely popular series. Cricket is well represented here, with Trevillion capturing the stride of Tendulkar as he drives another delivery to the boundary, while there are lovely tribute sketches to Botham and David Gower in their pomp. There’s the strain in Andy Murray’s face as he serves for victory at Wimbledon, the reach of Michael Jordan as he wows the fans with another slam dunk, and the accurate boot of Jonny Wilkinson as he slots another three points for England. Net gain: A thrilled Andy Murray with a Daily Mail spread featuring Paul Trevillion's depiction of the Briton . The Little Master by the Master of Movement: Sachin Tendulkar playing an expansive drive . There is truly something for everyone from a man who has drawn - always in ink, never oil pastels or paints - for publications such as Eagle, the Daily Mirror, Daily Express, The Sun, The Daily Telegraph and The Times. Of course, many have appeared exclusively in the pages of the Daily Mail and on MailOnline. Visitors to the Strand Gallery have the opportunity to purchase original artwork and signed limited edition copies of Trevillion’s greatest works, or simply admire their idols in full flow.

"She was renowned as a Hollywood star and style icon. And now Audrey Hepburn is to be celebrated with a photography exhibition at London's National Portrait Gallery. An exhibition about the actress's life and career will open in July and include family images of her at ballet practice and pictures taken during her early days working as a model in London. Scroll down for video . Celebration: An exhibition of photos of Audrey Hepburn - including this shot taken by Norman Parkinson in 1955 - will open at the National Portrait Gallery in July 2015 . Photographs from Life Magazine, taken during the making of her 1953 film Sabrina, will also go on show alongside posters for some of her most famous films. The Belgian-born actress performed at Ciro’s nightclub, which now forms the gallery’s archive and study room, in a series of revues in 1949 and 1950. The gallery’s deputy director Pim Baxter said: 'Audrey Hepburn was one of the world’s most celebrated actresses. 'I am delighted that the National Portrait Gallery will hold a major photography exhibition exploring the life and work of such a significant and much-loved figure who spent the formative early years of her career in Britain. The exhibition about Audrey's life will include pictures taken during her days working as a model in London - as well as this image, which was a publicity shot for 1954's Sabrina . The exhibition includes this photo taken by Sir Cecil Beaton in 1954. The Belgian-born actress performed at Ciro's nightclub, which now forms the gallery's archive and study . 'It is particularly appropriate that the exhibition will be staged in such close proximity to where she performed as a young woman at the very start of her career.' The exhibition runs to October 18. As the world continue's to celebrate Audrey Hepburn's impeccable style, her granddaughter is continuing her legacy. After spending most of her life out of the spotlight, Emma Ferrer is starting to make herself known. The 20-year-old art student was seen at New York Fashion week in July strolling past the Lincoln Center accompanied by Harper's Bazaar British editor, Glenda Bailey, who last month crowned Emma as the magazine's September issue cover star. Behind the scenes: Candid shots of the Audrey through the ages - including this photo captured in Rome in 1960 by Sir Cecil Beaton - will go on display at the gallery . Emma, whose 54-year-old father is Sean Hepburn Ferrer, Audrey's oldest son, was raised in Los Angeles and is currently in her third year at the Florence Academy of Art, in Italy. And although art is her primary focus, Emma is clearly taking tentative footsteps into the world of fashion as well. Last month's coveted Harper's Bazaar cover saw her effortlessly re-create her grandmother's iconic poses, in a stunning spread shot by Michael Avedon, grandson of legendary photographer Richard Avedon, for whom Audrey was a longtime muse. While her grandmother lost her life to cancer in 1993, a year before Emma was born, there's no denying that her legacy lives on within her. Charting her career: Photographs from magazines, as well as posters for some of her most famous films, will be on display at the London gallery. Right, Hepburn as Breakfast At Tiffany's Holly Golightly character in 1962, by Howell Conant. Left, a portrait taken by Angus McBean in 1950 . 'I've been questioning a lot lately what she means to me,' Emma told Harper's Bazaar. 'I knew her image, of course, and that I happened to be, by pure chance, related to her. But as a child I couldn't really relate to Audrey Hepburn, the actress. To me, she was family.' And despite never getting the chance to meet her grandmother, Emma's father Sean told the publication that his daughter's similarities to Audrey are plenty. 'My mother was the same as she was on the screen: unassuming, humble, funny, emotional, strong, delicate,' says the father-of-three, who has also pursued an acting career as well as helping run the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund. 'Fortunately Emma has much better boundaries than either Mom or I ever had. But the genes are strong - and the comedic gene is alive and well.' For Emma, the associations between her and Hepburn are unavoidable, and it's something she is slowly coming to terms with. 'Sometimes when I was younger, I felt confused toward what having a grandmother like her could mean in my life. But I am now understanding,' she said.","Hollywood actress and style icon to be celebrated in new exhibition in July .

"Caffeine is causing 'untimely deaths' and its 'lethality' is being underestimated, a leading expert has warned . Caffeine is so dangerous and is being consumed in such high quantities that it should now be regulated, a leading expert claims. Dr Jack James says that the stimulant is causing ‘untimely deaths’ and that its 'lethality' is being underestimated. Dr James, editor in chief of the Journal of Caffeine Research, and . head of the department of psychology at Reykjavik University, . Iceland, says he is concerned that the substance is increasingly being added to products such as energy drinks, alcoholic drinks and medicines. As a result, many of us are unwittingly consuming way more than we think - with worrying implications for our health and society as a whole. Dr James believes the risks caffeine poses to our health are so great that products that contain it should be taxed and restricted like cigarettes and alcohol. Sales to children in particular should be restricted. He says that as well as tea and coffee, caffeine is found in fizzy drinks, energy drinks, bottled water, alcoholic drinks (such as Tia Maria), cookies, chewing gum, yogurt and flavoured milk. It is also commonly found in cold and flu remedies, weight loss pills, mints, cosmetics, soaps and even tights to aid slimming. Even more worrying, he says that caffeine is also frequently used as a diluent (cutting agent) in illicit drugs. He notes that while some countries in . Europe and Scandinavia have begun to take regulatory action, including . sales restrictions and product labelling, most countries including the . UK and the U.S. have a ‘regulatory vacuum’. In his provocative editorial 'Death by Caffeine: How Many . Caffeine-related Fatalities and Near-misses Must There Be before We . Regulate?', he argues that the trend of children downing energy drinks is exacerbating the problem. He says that in order to . highlight the risks of caffeine, products should be labelled with the amount they contain and sales to children in particular should be restricted. Caffeine: Table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances . The U.S. Food and Drug administration announced last year that it . is investigating reports of five deaths being linked to Monster Energy . drinks. The company has denied any link. And in 2009, a father from Bolton said his 11-year-old son hanged himself after energy drinks . changed his behaviour. Lee Johns said his son Tyler was a . happy-go-lucky child until he started downing the drinks to make himself . feel grown up. Tyler went from thriving at school and impressing neighbours with his good . behaviour to becoming  'hyper and disruptive' in the months leading to his . death last year. A one-litre caffeine drink was lying near Tyler's body when his mother found him hanging in his bedroom. Dr James is also concerned that sporty teenagers who drink lots of caffeine are putting their hearts under a great deal of strain. He adds that although caffeine has been widely considered to be harmless, 'awareness is increasing that its consumption is associated with substantial harm, including fatalities and near-fatalities'. He says that caffeine was named as a contributing factor in 6,309 cases that the American National Poison Data System was notified of in 2011. Lethal: Dr Jack James (left) says caffeine is causing ‘untimely deaths’ . In 2009, 11-year old Tyler Johns (right) was found hanged after downing energy drinks . And the annual number of emergency room visits in the U.S. associated with energy drinks jumped 36 per cent . to 20,000 in 2011 compared to the previous year, according to a report released by the Substance Abuse & . Mental Health Services Administration. In just one year, the substance killed four people in Sweden, adds Dr James. He . says that caffeine - in the form of energy drinks - also offsets the . sedating effects of alcohol and encourages people to drink more. Furthermore, there is a 'growing body of evidence' which indicates that compared to alcohol alone, adding caffeine increases the risk of having unprotected sex, experiencing or committing sexual assault, drink driving and being violent. There is also evidence that children who drink caffeine are more likely to use alcohol, drugs and smoke in the future . There is also evidence that caffeine consumption by children may also make them more likely to use alcohol, drugs and smoke in the future. According to the Food Standards Agency, there is no recommended daily limit on caffeine because the amount people can tolerate varies hugely depending on a number of factors, such as age, weight and average caffeine consumption. A study by the government regulatory agency Health Canada concluded that . the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without . experiencing negative affect, such as anxiety or heart problems. Indeed, we can become used to caffeine over time. The only exception is for pregnant women, who are advised to consume no more than 200mg of caffeine a day, as it can have adverse effects on birth weight and pregnancy outcome. Children should have no more than 75mg. An 8oz can of Monster Energy has 92mg, while an 8oz Red Bull can has . 83mg. A bottle of Coca-Cola contains 58mg of caffeine, while a an 8oz . cup of decaf coffee has 5mg and hot chocolate has 9mg. Caffeine intoxication is recognised by the World Health Organisation as a medical condition. Symptoms include nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, stomach upset, tremors and rapid heartbeat. Two known triggers of the heart rhythm disorder supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are caffeine and alcohol, so the risk increases if they are taken at the same time. SVTs can make your heart beat very quickly - up to 160 beats per minute. The result can be terrifying palpitations, chest pain, dizziness and feeling out of breath.","Dr Jack James claims that the stimulant is causing ‘untimely deaths’

"The captain of the doomed Costa Concordia cruise liner has admitted he was showing off when he attempted a dangerous salute to the island of Giglio, in a move which ended in disaster. Francesco Schettino is giving evidence for the first time about the 2012 shipwreck off the Italian island in which 32 passengers and crew were killed.

Scroll down for video . The captain of the doomed Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is giving evidence for the first time about the 2012 shipwreck off an Italian island in which 32 passengers and crew were killed. Schettino appeared to be smothering a smile as he faced court. He has admitted he was showing off when he attempted a dangerous salute to the island of Giglio, in a move which ended in disaster . Schettino told the court he wanted to 'kill three birds with one stone', and had performed the salute to please the ship's head waiter, whose family came from Giglio, to impress a friend who was staying on the island, and to provide a night-time view for passengers . Schettino denied taking the route near Giglio island to impress a Moldovan dancer he had brought to the bridge. The woman has testified the two were lovers. He said had performed the salute to please the ship's head waiter, whose family came from Giglio, to impress a friend who was staying on the island, and to provide a night-time view for passengers. The disgraced former captain  - who arrived in court still wearing sunglasses - has long said he looked forward to his day in court to vindicate himself. Schettino said he had previously navigated close to the island, and that it wasn't necessary to inform officials of ship owner Costa Crociere Spa on shore about the altered route since it was considered 'an approach' - not a 'touristic route.' The ship hit rocks, creating a huge gash in the hull and forcing the evacuation of 4,200 passengers as the ship listed. His defence claims that no-one died in the collision itself, but that the failure of a back-up generator and supposedly water-tight compartments which were flooded created problems during the evacuation, when the deaths occurred. He also denies abandoning ship, saying he was thrown into the water. Captain Schettino is on trial for multiple manslaughter, dereliction of duty and abandoning ship, and faces up to 20 years in prison if he is found guilty .

Schettino arrived 45 minutes late for his trial in Grosseto on charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship . Schettino is being tried alone after five other defendants reached plea bargains. If convicted, he could receive up to 20 years in prison. His lawyer described him as 'tense, concentrated' after he arrived at the court wearing sunglasses and with slicked hair.

As a result Redford had her car and most of the items from her purse returned to her. Redford, who is staying in Indiana while her husband is receiving cancer treatment said the experience had been her more thankful than ever on Thanksgiving. 'For me already it doesn't seem like Thanksgiving, because I'm not at home and I'm not with my family, but to me now I'm going to be way more thankful because I got my stuff back,' she said.

"'I am so concerned about my  13-year-old grandson. He is ruining life for his parents and two younger siblings' (picture posed by model) I am so concerned about my 13-year-old grandson. He is ruining life for his parents and two younger . siblings. I lose sleep at night worrying. He has a violent temper which erupts when he is told off, and although he is, or was, a very clever grammar school boy, he won’t do homework or take pride in his appearance. He steals food – a six-pack of desserts from the fridge, or a whole packet of biscuits. Last week his dad had money taken from his wallet. We know it was him, to buy sweets. Our GP suggested he has an eating disorder and we’re now waiting for a specialist referral. But I wonder if he could have Asperger’s syndrome, or depression. Can you advise us please and suggest coping strategies? This is a terribly sad, complex problem . made all the more difficult because of the ripple effect this boy’s . behaviour is having on the whole family. At the centre is a teenager who used to . be happy and now is desperately in need of love and support from the . family he appears to be rejecting. Rather than looking for coping . strategies, it’s his change in personality that needs exploring. Normal . teenage angst could be the reason: not every child sails through . adolescence. But it is equally possible that he is depressed, terribly anxious or suffering self-esteem issues. Focusing on the food aspect is wrong: it’s just one of many self-destructive symptoms. An eating disorder assessment can take time, and is not a holistic approach to his troubles. It is unlikely he has developed Asperger’s at this age given his lack of previous symptoms but I am concerned that what you describe is more than simply a difficult teenager. His parents need to go back to the GP and ask for a mental health assessment with the child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) team: they not only offer assessment and therapy, they will also look at support for the family. Although he appears to want to destroy everything around him he is simply trying to exert control over his life; perhaps he feels out of control with his feelings or rules from home. Could his choices for food be more flexible and free? With a situation like this it is very easy for parents to slip into a very negative rhetoric, whereas what he needs is a more positive approach. Given his behaviour, praising him must be hard. But love, support and encouragement as well as safe, clear boundaries are what he needs. My husband went to see his GP with a suspicious mole on his back – partly black, partly pink and bleeding intermittently – in September 2012 and was told it was ‘nothing to worry about’. Malignant melanoma is not always easy to diagnose . Still worried, six months later he saw a different GP. A biopsy diagnosed melanoma. By October last year there were tumours in his abdomen, bowel and spine. He passed away in February, and suffered greatly. We are devastated, as he was always careful in the sun – and want people to know more about this deadly cancer. I am so sorry for your loss. It is not always easy to diagnose melanoma – there are roughly 9,000 a cases a year so the majority of moles a GP will assess will be benign. However, sadly, your instinct was right. A mole that is bleeding and has different colours warrants further assessment. Other red flags are an irregular border, rapid growth and asymmetry: this should have instigated a referral to a dermatologist within the NHS guidelines of two weeks. We must never assume that someone who covers up in the sun will not get skin cancer: melanoma is associated with sun exposure particularly as a child but there are other risk factors too including being fair-skinned, having a lot of moles and family history. In any medical situation, it is never wrong to listen to your instinct and push for a timely second opinion. Drug companies are yet to bring out a female version of Viagra – despite spending billions on research. There are treatments, mainly available privately, such as testosterone or other hormonal therapies. But critics point out that for women, unlike men, the problem isn’t a mechanical one that can be fixed with a pill. Jamie Dornan will soon play Christian Grey in 50 Shades of Grey. 'If only they could distill him into tablet form,' said Dr Ellie . We are more cerebral creatures. With this in mind, I have greatly enjoyed New Worlds on Channel 4, starring the delectable Jamie Dornan, pictured above with Freya Mavor. He is to appear as Christian Grey in the film of Fifty Shades Of Grey, a book that has undoubtedly done more to enhance women’s sex lives than all the potions the pharmaceutical giants can muster. If only they could distil him into tablet form. Not a week goes by without some new diet advice that promises to release the nation from the grip of obesity. Dr Ellie said it seemed 'rather ridiculous' to opt for a supposedly 'healthier' whisky if you consume vastly more alcohol . This week, we’ve been told which alcoholic drinks to opt for on the basis of lower sugar content. Whatever the opinion of my esteemed colleagues at Action on Sugar, it seems rather ridiculous to opt for a supposedly ‘healthier’ whisky if you consume vastly more alcohol. While cutting sugar is the new fad, let’s stick to proven sensible health advice for a nation of big drinkers: keep alcohol intake down, never mind the sugar. And a word of caution about the other big diet story this week – research seemingly showing we should aiming for seven or even 10 portions of fruit and veg a day. Researchers claimed that those eating more portions of fruit and veg were less likely to die. But the study didn’t ask about other dietary intake nor exercise levels. So while they showed people who eat more veg live longer, they can’t say if it is because of this, or because they also tend to be the people who exercise and avoid junk food. A few more frozen peas isn’t a cure for an unhealthy lifestyle.","Answers questions about a troubled teenager and coping with melanoma .

"A scientist who apparently worked in some capacity for Lockheed Martin has claimed aliens on Earth are real and have made contact with Earth in a video posted shortly before his death. Boyd Bushman apparently drew on his own personal experiences to reveal that extraterrestrials were in Area 51. And in a bizarre interview he also claims anti-gravity is one of several technologies being hidden by the government. In a video Boyd Bushman (shown) says aliens are real and they have visited Earth. He made the claims before he passed away on 7 August 2014. Incidents such as Roswell in 1947 were caused by aliens, he says. And he also shows off 'pictures' of aliens and their home world . The controversial video was apparently made shortly before Mr Bushman died on 7 August 2014. He had several patents attributed to him that were assigned to Lockheed Martin, and he was apparently also a senior scientist at the company - although that claim is disputed. These patents include a magnetic drive, an light beam to find objects, a thermally energised electrical power source and a heat radiation detection system. Mr Bushman says aliens have visited Earth, and continue to do so. He says they come from a planet called Quintumnia 68 light-years away and can make the journey in 45 minutes. These aliens have fingers and toes like us and are five feet (1.5 meters) tall. They are also apparently up to 230 years old - although Mr Bushman didn’t say if he meant a Quintumnian year or a humble Earth year. And the aliens can even commute through telepathy. Having visited Earth in their spacecraft, scientists here have apparently been reverse-engineering their UFO technology. This includes the accidental shooting down of a flying saucer in 1947 – infamously associated with the Roswell incident. Remarkably, Mr Bushman also says he gave a camera to the aliens to take pictures of their home world – which he shows off in a series of blurry images. And last but not least the US, Russia and China are also apparently working on anti-gravity technology. In the video Mr Bush says there are Americans working on UFOs from outer space 24 hours a day, reported the Metro. He also says aliens hail from a planet 68 light-years away called Quintumnia, but that it takes them just 45 minutes to reach our planet. ‘There are two groups of aliens,’ said Mr Bushman. ‘They divide them into two groups. It’s like a cattle ranch. 'One group are wranglers, and the others are rustlers - the stealers of cattle.’ Among the other wild claims in the video, he says there is a special flight path to Area 51 from space. Aliens at the base are apparently five feet (1.5 metres) long and up to 230 years old. They each have five fingers, which are 30 per cent longer than ours, and five webbed toes. And the Quintumnians apparently communicate through telepathy. In yet another bizarre claim, he also says scientists at Area 51 have been working with Russian and Chinese counterparts to develop anti-gravity technology. His claims, understandably, have been met with widespread criticism and derision. Speaking to MailOnline, UFO expert Nigel Watson, author of the Haynes UFO Investigations Manual, said: ‘This story has been received with equal measures of enthusiasm, curiosity, confusion and scepticism in the UFO community. Some commenters have said that the alien Mr Bushman shows in his video looks oddly similar to a plastic one shown in shops (pictured). 'Was Bushman delusional or telling the truth? Certainly, Bushman believed in what he was saying,' said UFO expert Nigel Watson . Mr Bushman says scientists have been reverse-engineering UFO technology from aliens that have landed on Earth.This includes the accidental shooting down of a flying saucer in 1947 – infamously associated with the Roswell incident (stock image shown) ‘Several people have noted that the alien in the pictures produced by Bushman look very much like an alien doll sold by shops several years ago. ‘Was Bushman delusional or telling the truth? Certainly, Bushman believed in what he was saying. ‘As long ago as 2008 he passed a polygraph test, during which he claimed he had worked on antigravity projects, alien technologies and had even met and photographed an alien, and examined at least eight different types of alien spacecraft. ‘Bushman also revealed that he had received death threats and that security personnel had attempted to discredit him and tried to keep him from talking to the public. ‘ . And Alejandro Rojas at website Open Minds said: ‘Like so many stories in the UFO field, Bushman’s is enigmatic. ‘The whole affair could easily be written off as the delusional ramblings of an old man. ‘The only thing that causes one to pause is Bushman’s background. Why would a high level scientist begin making up such wild stories?' Lockheed Martin was yet to provide a comment on the claims when contacted by MailOnline.","In a video Boyd Bushman says aliens are real and they have visited Earth .

"It's hard to believe that a little girl in pigtails, who's only in her first year of school, could possibly be the best six-year-old surfer and skater in the world. She goes by the name of 'the flying squirrel' and she's only been surfing for 18 months. So there's no disputing that Quincy Symonds has certainly defied the odds from her birth up until now, proving that age is no barrier when it comes to excelling at your ultimate passions in life. Scroll down for video . Six-year-old Quincy Symonds from Tweed Heads, north-eastern NSW, has been surfing for 18 months . Nicknamed 'the flying squirrel', she hopes to make a mark on the surfing and skating world . The fearless girl has already gained multiple surfing sponsors and has been dubbed as the next Layne Beachley or Stephanie Gilmore . The Tweed Heads local caught her first wave at the age of four when she decided she would go out with her father Jake while they were holidaying in the Gold Coast, 94km south of Brisbane. 'She had no idea what surfing was but she just wanted to hang out with her daddy,' mother Kim Symonds said. When Quincy was born, she was kept in the Intensive Care Unit for three weeks . 'She hadn't swum in the ocean much or wasn't exposed to the water that much as she lived near a farm but she really doesn't like missing out on things. 'After her first wave, she was addicted.' Mrs Symonds witnessed the change in her daughter that very moment she jumped on her surfboard. 'I was freaking out but she looked so excited but once she got on that board there was something about her that changed,' she said. 'Her mindset is different and she's not afraid of the ocean. She seems so calm and complete when she's out there. 'I know the risks involved but it's where she wants to be so I wouldn’t stop her from that.' Two months later, Quincy's parents decided that when the ocean was too rough for their little one she would have to find another alternative. That's when her other love for skating began. 'She keeps saying that she wants to be a pro surfer and skater when she grows up and she loves the two sports equally so she wouldn't be able to choose between the two,' Mrs Symonds said. 'I think it's awesome. It's such an adventure we're on and it feels as though she's the one who's taking us for a ride.' But the journey hasn't been without its complications. Quincy has big dreams with hopes of becoming both a pro surfer and skater when she grows up . The six-year-old started skating two months after she started surfing at the age of four . Quincy working on some new tricks with fellow skaters . At birth, Quincy suffered from adrenal insufficiency which left her in the Intensive Care Unit for three weeks. She was diagnosed with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia which means she is steroid dependent. Since then, the fearless little girl has been taking cortisone medication three times a day. 'If someone told me five years ago that I'd be where I'm at now I would've laughed,’ Mrs Symonds said. 'Quincy blows my mind. I'm speechless. I don't know how she does it at her age and how she can be so focused and driven. 'But I think when you find your passion nothing can hold you back. Not even Quincy's condition or her age and you could see that when she was out in the water.' So much so, the six-year-old has already signed on multiple surfing sponsors and gained a huge following on social media. Her coach Anthony Pope says she has a lot of potential and could possibly be the world's best surfer and skater in her age group. 'She has incredible balance and her ability to judge the conditions and adjust is at a level I've never seen in someone her age,' he told the ABC. Quincy's love for surfing began when she decided that she wanted to follow her father out for a surf during a holiday in the Gold Coast, southeastern Queensland . The flying squirrel is in her first year at school but sometimes wishes she was out in the water when there's a big swell . But the little surfer and skater says she loves both sports and couldn't possibly choose between the two . Quincy started skating when her parents decided there were times when it was too dangerous to be out in the water . Despite her big dreams, the flying squirrel - a nickname which stuck as a toddler when she befriended the furry animal while her family lived in the US - has only just started in her first year at school. However there are times when she wishes she was elsewhere. 'When there’s a big swell or the weather is nice, she says she wants to go out in the water or skating,' Mrs Symonds said. 'People say it's funny hearing that from a little girl. 'So I asked her why she loves it so much and she simply said: ""it's just what I do"".' Quincy was diagnosed with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia which means she is steroid dependent . The six-year-old's condition and age won't get in the way of her big dreams .","Quincy Symonds started surfing at the age of four and picked up skating two months after .

"Three children were rescued from a burning car in Pennsylvania after their mother left them alone in the vehicle while she went shopping inside a Walmart. Stacey Nelson, 32, is facing charges after she admitted to police that she left her three kids unsupervised to shop for 'about five minutes'. Police said it is extremely lucky that the children, aged two, three and ten escaped unhurt from the blaze on Friday afternoon. The mother left her three children alone in the car while she went shopping in Walmart (file picture) According to the Bradford Era, the source of the fire was traced to the passenger seat of the car where the ten-year-old girl had been sitting, while her younger siblings were strapped into their car seats in the back. Police said the girl told them she had been playing with a yellow lighter that she had found in the glove compartment and had 'caught some papers on fire and tried to get it out, but it was too late'. Foster Township Police Chief Tom Munn said passers-by in the parking lot rescued the children from the unlocked SUV. Ms Nelson was found inside the store. Firefighters extinguished the fire and the car, which had suffered heavy damage to the interior, was towed from the scene.

"Accused: Steve Sells has been arrested after his daughter was found severely malnourished . A father has been arrested after his mentally disabled 15-year-old daughter was found covered in feces and weighing just 35 pounds. Father-of-three Steve Sells, 58, from Anderson, Indiana, was arrested on Monday night - but he insisted that his daughter was so small because of her medical condition, authorities said. Family members had taken the girl to St. Vincent Hospital in Anderson on Monday afternoon. Doctors contacted police and she was then flown to Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in Indianapolis for treatment. Authorities said her condition could be life threatening. Anderson Police told Fox59 that the teenager, who is mentally disabled, was severely malnourished and covered in feces when she was taken to hospital. She weighed just 35 pounds, which is the average weight of a five-year-old child. Neighbor Thomas McAllister told the station that Sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children. He said that Sells had always given the impression he was a caring father. 'That is mind boggling,' he added. 'That is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that.' Sells' wife returned home on Monday evening but refused to speak to reporters, FOX59 said. Family: He lives at the home with his wife Joetta (pictured) and his three children. His wife was questioned by police but so far he is the only person arrested in connection with the case, police said . Sells was the only family member arrested, but other family members have been questioned, The IndyChannel reported. The man blamed his daughter's low weight on a medical condition, Anderson Police Detective Joel Sandefur told WTHR, but 'that has to be investigated to see if it's even plausible or not', he said. The detective did not provide any details about that or the nature of the girl's disability. 'It's troubling to see a human being treated in this manner, especially when it's a family member of someone, someone's own child,' he added. Scene: Sells, who lives at this Anderson home, said his daughter's weight was due to her condition . Sells will faces preliminary child neglect charges. He will likely face more serious charges if his daughter does not survive her injuries. He is currently being held on a 72-hour hold and it is not clear whether he has an attorney. Anderson is about 40 miles northeast of Indianapolis.

"By 2050, a completely new type of human will evolve as a result of radical new technology, behaviour, and natural selection. This is according to Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute, who claims mankind is undergoing a major 'evolutionary transition'. In less than four decades, Mr Last claims we will live longer, have children in old age and rely on artificial intelligence to do mundane tasks. Scroll down for video . In less than four decades, Mr Last claims we will live longer, have kids in old age (stock picture used) This shift is so significant, he claims, it is comparable to the change from monkeys to apes, and apes to humans. 'Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,' Mr Last says, who believe we will spend much of our time living in virtual reality. Some evolutionary scientists believe this age could be as high as 120 by 2050. Mr Last claims humans will also demonstrate delayed sexual maturation, according to a report by Christina Sterbenz in Business Insider. This refers to something known as life history theory which attempts to explain how natural selection shape key events in a creature's life, such as reproduction. This shift is so significant, says Mr Last, that it is comparable to the change from apes into humans. 'Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,' he claims . Mr Last predicts that by 2050, humans will live significantly longer, robots will replace unskilled jobs, women will have children older and people will have more time to engage in cultural activities . It suggests that as brain sizes increase, organisms need more energy and time to reach their full potential, and so reproduce less. Instead of living fast and dying young, Mr Last believes humans will live slow and die old. 'Global society at the moment is a complete mess,' he told MailOnline. 'But in crisis there is opportunity, and in apocalypse there can be metamorphosis. 'So I think the next system humanity creates will be far more sophisticated, fair, and abundant than our current civilisation.

And as well as having more child-free years to enjoy leisure time, Mr Last believes artificial intelligence will offset the need for low-skill jobs. His views wrote a paper, titled 'Human Evolution, Life History Theory, and the End of Biological Reproduction' published Current Aging Science . The change is already happening. Today, the average age at which a woman in Britain has her first baby has been rising steadily stands at 29.8. In the US, just one per cent of first children were born to women over the age of 35 in 1970. By 2012, that figure rose to 15 per cent. 'As countries become socioeconomically advanced, more and more people, especially women, have the option to engage in cultural reproduction,' Mr Last added. And as well as having more child-free years to enjoy leisure time, he believes artificial intelligence will offset the need for low-skill jobs. We may also spend a large amount of time living in virtual reality.'I'm not quite sure most people have really internalised the implications of this possibility,' Mr Last said. His views are detailed in a paper, titled 'Human Evolution, Life History Theory, and the End of Biological Reproduction' published Current Aging Science. By 2040, cabs will be driven by Google robots, shops will become showrooms for online outlets and call centres will be staffed by intelligent droids. That’s the scenario depicted in recent research which suggests robots could be taking over our lives and jobs in less than 30 years. The competition for work caused by a rise in the robots population will see us heading to surgeons for ‘additional processing power for our brains’, they claim. We may also be requesting bionic implants for our hands that will make us able to perform tasks as fast as any machine. Futurologists, commissioned by global job search website xpatjobs.com, say workers will have less job security and will work more unsociable hours. Those who take these risks and innovate with their own bodies will be the biggest earners in 2040, they claim. However, the study added that workers may be left with poor eyesight, smaller sexual organs, and constantly-furrowed brows as they struggle to keep up to life in the 21st century. The study predicts that by 2050 a typical male worker, aged 35, will have red eyes, a smaller penis, a larger brain, advanced language skills and bioimplants to improve their performance .","This is according to Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute .

"If the aliens really are landing, this latest picture seems to confirm that their first port of call on Earth will be Russia. After other claims of extraterrestrial life turning up in Siberia, the latest is from a Russian woman who says she kept a frozen alien corpse in her fridge. The mysterious 'lifeform' was reportedly kept by Marta Yegorovnam in her fridge in the western Russian city of Petrozavodsk for two years, while she took five pictures to prove its existence. Intelligent life? The 2ft high creature was apparently stored in Marta Yegorovnam's fridge in western Russia for two years . 'Crash victim': The 'creature' was said to have been retrieved from a UFO crash site in 2009. It has an enormous head, bulbous eyes and one stick-like arm . Heading for Earth? The alien in Miss Yegorovnam's fridge has conveniently been removed by men from the 'Karelian Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences' The 'body', the third alien sighting in Russian in recent months, was reportedly retrieved by Miss Yegorovnam from a UFO crash site near her summer house in 2009. She says she approached the flaming wreckage and crumpled metal which she described as 'unbearably hot' and near the twisted hulk lay the dead alien. The 'creature' is two feet long, has an enormous head, large bulbous eyes and an appearance somewhere between a fish and a humanoid. It also appears to have what looks like a string-like arm protruding from its body. Proof at last? This screen grab shows an apparent UFO on the ground in Siberia earlier this year with what appears to be an unearthly being to its right and four other beings directly in front of the glowing craft . Naturally, Miss Yegorovnam did what most would in the same situation and stored the alien in her fridge for two years, according to Unexplained Mysteries. The website reported that two men turned up at her home a few days ago and confiscated the corpse for investigative purposes, claiming to be from the Karelian Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The footage was unearthed by noted paranormal writer and expert Michael Cohen. Mr Cohen, 40, said: 'This could be an elaborate hoax, however the possibility that this might be a genuine alien should not be discounted. 'Russia is a hotbed of UFO activity and possible alien craft has been tracked by both military and civilian agencies. 'In all likelihood most alien beings would look strange to us, much like this specimen.' This latest claim from Russia comes after footage  filmed in August in the remote Irkutsk region of .

April, two students who claimed to have recovered a body from a UFO . crash site admitted that the creature was in fact made out of bread. Timur Hilall, 18, and Kirill Vlasov, 19, shot the video that showed the . alien's mangled remains frozen in snow, also in Irkutsk, Siberia. The pair were questioned by police over their 'extraterrestrial discovery' but admitted to their stunt.

"An NHS chief has said alcohol is becoming a 'silent killer' in the UK as he warned middle class drinkers that a glass of wine  is just as harmful as downing three shots of vodka. Duncan Selbie, the head of Public Health England, said deaths from alcohol-related illnesses had soared by 500 per cent since the seventies to become the third biggest killer of working age people in the UK. Britain is now the only country  in western Europe except Finland where cases of liver disease are increasing. Mr Selbie added that the middle classes would often pour themselves a glass of wine at the end of the day with 'no idea' how much they were actually drinking. Scroll down for video . Duncan Selbie said that deaths from alcohol in working age people have increased by 500 per cent since the 1970s because many people have no idea how much they are drinking . Glasses size has also increased alongside our alcohol consumption so drinkers can be pouring themselves more without realising it. Last week the Lancet commission said Britain is turning into the capital of Europe for alcohol-related disease as they recommended that liver scans should be offered by GPs. In his weekly staff briefing, Mr Selbie said liver disease is largely preventable but was a 'silent killer with 75 per cent of people with cirrhosis only being diagnosed once they are admitted to hospital. 'Liver disease is largely preventable with the three big risk factors being alcohol – for example, a large glass of wine is like three shots of vodka, so it is very easy for people to pour a glass and have no idea how much they are drinking.' Fiona Bruce, the Labour MP, agreed, telling the Telegraph: 'This is an issue we need to take much more seriously, and revise our view of the binge drinker as a teenager out late at night. A glass of wine after work does the same harm as drinking three shots of vodka (coloured vodka shots pictured) Duncan Selbie, the head of Public Health England, has warned . 'Increasingly too high levels of alcohol consumption are occurring in the home by older age groups and we all have a responsibility to challenge and help address this.' As liver disease cases increase, a treatment that reduces the urge for alcohol was made available last month to those who regularly consume more than 7.5 units every day . Nalmefene costs £3 and is suitable for anyone who drinks half a bottle of wine or three pints each day . It was rolled out in Scotland last October, where so far 53 people have used it . Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland,  chair of the all Parliamentary Save the Pub Group, said drinkers would be safer to enjoy their favourite tipple in the local pub which had a 'legal responsibility' to give controlled measures and not allow punters to get too drunk. Tracey Crouch, the former chair of the alcohol misuse group, and Conservative MP she was 'really pleased' the issue had been raised by Public Health England to try and encourage people to change their drinking habits. 'People will see it is a very different thing pouring a glass of wine to pouring a three measure vodka but this is why it important to have calorific content on the labels - you wouldn't pour three shots of vodka but you also wouldn't sit down and eat six donuts - but you tend to pour yourself a large measure of wine not a small glass.'","NHS Chief Duncan Selbie says people don't know how much they drink .

"Vasagel, pictured, is a 'polymer hydrogel' which is injected into the tube which sperm pass through to reach the penis, blocking it rather than cutting it as in a vasectomy . Men could be using long-lasting birth control - which doesn’t involve condoms - within the next three years, according to a not-for-profit organisation. Trials of a new male birth control injection, Vasalgel, are showing promising results. Developers hope the new drug  will be cheap, reversible and long-lasting. Vasalgel is a 'polymer hydrogel' that is injected into the vas deferens - the tube that sperm passes through on the way to the penis. The gel acts to block sperm, thus preventing pregnancy. It is being developed by the Parsemus Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation who develop low-cost medical solutions. They said the procedure has the same effect as a vasectomy, but is less invasive as surgery is not required because the vas deferens is blocked with the gel, rather than cut. They hope the new contraceptive will be affordable, adding they want it to cost 'less than a flat screen TV'. During current trials on baboons, three males were injected with the Vasalgel contraceptive. Each baboon was then left living with 10 to 15 female baboons. After six months, no female baboons became pregnant, although the trial is not quite over. By the end of the year, the Parsemus Foundation said they will have a lot more information on whether Vasalgel is effective. They added that if all goes well they will be planning for clinical trials with humans to start next year. It is also more reversible, they said. If a man wants his sperm unblocked, another polymer gel can be injected to flush out the Vasalgel that is blocking the sperm. The product is based on another male contraceptive being developed, which is called RISUG. Both RISUG and Vasalgel work on the principle of using a gel to block the vas deferens, but are formulated differently. While the Parsemus Foundation have not said how long a Vasalgel injection would last as a contraceptive, a RISUG injection is said to last 10 years. Men could be using long-lasting and reversible contraceptive Vasalgel within three years if clinical trials go well . A spokesperson from the Parsemus Foundation said: ‘We want to get Vasalgel on the market as soon as possible, but all the proper efficacy and safety testing needs to be completed. ‘Vasalgel is currently in animal testing, with human trials expected to start in early 2015and 2015-2016 (larger trials). 'If everything goes well and with enough public support, we hope to get Vasalgel on the market in 2016-2017.’ The Parsemus Foundation will be asking for public donations to fund the clinical trials on humans next year. Another male contraceptive in early stages of development is the ‘clean sheets’ or ‘dry orgasm’ pill. This is a drug that could be taken before sex which leads to a semen-free orgasm. The orgasm feels the same but semen is not released. Developers intend to design a drug which will take effect within a few hours of being ingested, which will wear off within 24 hours. A man could take this pill only as needed before having sex. Researchers said this could also be effective in reducing the transmission of HIV from male to their partners. Kings College London researchers Dr Nnaemeka Amobi and Dr Christopher Smith are seeking partnership with a pharmaceutical company, which should speed the process of bringing a product to market.","Vasalgel is a gel that is injected into the vas deferens as a contraceptive .

The Elland Road club, who are managerless following the departure of David Hockaday, told their fans to stay awake during the last hour of deadline day as there was business to be done.

"The Obama administration went into bunker mode on Tuesday after news leaked that the president had selected former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter as his next Pentagon chief. An Italian Internet hoaxer created a fake Twitter account in Carter's name Tuesday morning and tweeted that he had gotten the job. And two major news outlets claimed to have inside information that the Carter pick was a done deal. But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was tight-lipped in his press briefing. 'What I can tell you is – not much,' he told reporters. 'Mr. Carter is obviously somebody who has generated a lot of headlines today.' Earnest said Carter 'certainly deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government,' but insisted, 'I don't have any additional insight to share with you.' A White House official had told MailOnline earlier in the day that 'we are not in a position to confirm the personnel rumors, sorry.' Scroll down for video . Bunker mentality: Josh Earnest wouldn't confirm anything about a Pentagon pick on Tuesday . An Italian journalist created a fake Twitter account in the name of likely US Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter on Tuesday, fooling reporters and bringing a torrent of phone calls to the White House and the Pentagon . SECRETARY-IN-WAITING: Former Deputy Decretary Ashton Carter is the likely Hagel replacement . Speculation ran rampant all day that Carter, a former Pentagon official who left the Obama administration in 2013, would be the president's pick. But Italian journalist and schoolteacher Tommasso Debenedetti had everyone fooled into thinking Carter had publicly confirmed the rumor. 'President Obama phones me announcing his decision to appoint me as Defense Secretary. I'm honoured and happy,' read a tweet from an account in Ashton's name, created Tuesday morning. The British spelling set off digital speculation, however, and Debenedetti admitted his ruse an hour later. Debenedetti is known for impersonating famous figures on Twitter, including author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. He has also fooled Italian newspapers into publishing phony interviews he claimed to have conducted with authors John Grisham, Arthur Miller, Gore Vidal, Toni Morrison, Derek Walcott and Philip Roth. Nevertheless, CNN and Bloomberg both reported that Obama would name Carter – the real one – to succeed outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Carter, a former deputy secretary at the Department of . Defense who has never served in the active military, had been considered a leading candidate for the job to . replace Chuck Hagel, who is resigning. Other front-runners, however, had already said they didn't want the thankless job. Michèle Flournoy, who was poised to become the first female Pentagon chief, pulled out last week. Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed followed suit days later. A Pentagon spokesman told Reuters that he was unaware of a decision to name Carter to the post, and . referred reporters to the White House, which had no immediate . comment. A spokeswoman for Carter also had no . immediate comment. Other names have been circulated as a possible replacement . for Hagel, including former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig and . Kurt Campbell, a former Assistant Secretary of State for East . Asian and Pacific Affairs who now heads the Asia Group, a . strategy and capitol advisory group. Tommasso Debenedetti is known for impersonating famous figures on Twitter, including author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad . Obama said last week that the ousted Hagel, the only Republican in his cabinet, was an 'exemplary' Defense Secretary and 'is and has been a great friend of mine' since he was a 'green behind the ears senator' serving on the Foreign Relations Committee . Hagel was the first enlisted combat veteran to lead the Department of Defense but earned very little support from his fellow Republicans in the US Senate . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, a former general . counsel at the Pentagon who had been believed to be under active . consideration, also took himself out of consideration, according to a . source familiar with the situation. Carter was the No. 2 official at the Pentagon from October . 2011 to December 2013. Previously, he was the Pentagon's chief . arms buyer. He also served as assistant secretary of defense for . international security policy under President Bill Clinton. Carter has bachelor's degrees in physics and medieval . history from Yale, a doctorate in theoretical physics from . Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, according to . the Pentagon's website. Carter's academic record brought Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to joke at Carter's farewell ceremony in 2013 that he has been called an 'uber-wonk' and that in Hollywood circles he would be considered 'not hot.' But Dempsey said Carter had earned respect far and wide. 'It's lucky for us that you have worked without glamour or fame behind the scenes to make sure through good management and common sense and discipline that we are an organization that continues to adapt to the challenge that we find in front of us,' Dempsey said then. 'He did it all again without fanfare. In fact, I think he's been called the most important, least known figure in Washington, or some language to that effect, and I agree with that.' Hagel resigned under pressure last week after less than two . years at the helm of the Defense Department.","White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest refused to say if Carter would be the next secretary of defense .

The tough-tackling midfielder fell out with Republic of Ireland boss Mick McCarthy ahead of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea after being left unimpressed by his country's preparation for the tournament. Keane, who was playing for Manchester United at the time, had a furious row with McCarthy and told him: 'Mick, you're a liar... you're a f****** w*****. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a f****** w***** and you can stick your World Cup up your a***. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your b*******.' Unsurprisingly he was sent home by his manager. Keane has been a regular pundit for ITV's Champions League and England coverage in recent years, winning plaudits for his straight-talking and honest approach. He was involved in the channel's World Cup launch just two weeks ago alongside fellow pundits Lee Dixon, Gus Poyet, Fabio Cannavaro and Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill.

"Former American President Dwight D. Eisenhower had three secret meetings with aliens, a former US government consultant has claimed. The 34th President of the United States met the extra terrestrials at a remote air base in New Mexico in 1954, according to lecturer and author Timothy Good. Eisenhower and other FBI officials are said to have organised the showdown with the space creatures by sending out 'telepathic messages'. Bizarre: Former American President Dwight D. Eisenhower had three secret meetings with aliens, a former US government consultant has claimed . The two parties finally met up on three separate occasions at the Holloman Air Force base and there were 'many witnesses'. Conspiracy theorists have circulated increased rumours in recent months that the meeting between the Commander-in-Chief and people from another planet took place. But the claims from Mr Good, a former U.S. Congress and Pentagon consultant, are the first to be made publicly by a prominent academic. Speaking on Frank Skinner's BBC2 current affairs show Opinionated, he said that governments around the world have been in regular contact with aliens for many decades. Odd meeting: It has been claimed that Dwight D. Eisenhower met the extra-terrestrials at the Holloman Air Force base in New Mexico . 'Aliens have made both formal and informal contact with thousands of people throughout the world from all walks of life,' he added. Asked why the aliens don't go to somebody 'important' like Barack Obama, he said: 'Well, certainly I can tell you that in 1954, President Eisenhower had three encounters, set up meetings with aliens, which took place at certain Air Force bases including Holloman Air Force base in New Mexico.' He added that there were 'many witnesses'. Eisenhower, who was president from 1953 to 1961, is known to have had a strong belief in life on other planets. Extra-terrestrial: Eisenhower, who was president from 1953 to 1961, is known to have had a strong belief in life on other planets . The former five-star general in the United States Army who commanded the Allied Forces in Europe during the Second World War, was also keen on pushing the U.S. space programme. His meeting with the cosmic life forms is said to have taken place while officials were told that he was on vacation in Palm Springs, California, in February 1954. The initial meeting is supposed to have taken place with aliens who were 'Nordic' in appearance, but the agreement was eventually 'signed' with a race called 'Alien Greys'. Mr Good added: 'We know that up to 90 per cent of all UFO reports can be explained in conventional terms. However, I would say millions of people worldwide have actually seen the real thing.' According to classified documents released by the Ministry of Defence in 2010, Winston Churchill may have ordered a UFO sighting to be kept secret. The UFO was seen over the East Coast of England by an RAF reconnaissance plane returning from a mission in France or Germany towards the end of the war. Churchill is said to have discussed how to deal with UFO sightings with Eisenhower.","Ex-President met with extra-terrestrials on three separate occasions at New Mexico air base .

"One of the wives of Islamic State commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have been detained by the Lebanese army, according to security officials. The woman, believed to be hairdresser Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi, was reportedly using a false passport when she was caught 10-days ago with the help of 'foreign intelligence apparatus', the Lebanese newspaper As- Safir reported. She was described by senior Lebanese security officials as 'one of the wives' of the terror chief who the UN say wields 'absolute power' over the militant group which controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, Lebanon's neighbor to the east. One of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wives has been detained by the Lebanese army trying to cross the border on a false passport . One of Baghdadi's wives Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi, pictured in May, is known to have at least three children. She was reportedly part of a prisoner exchange involving women who had been arrested by Syrian security forces and a group of nuns held by militants . Despite pulling off quite a coup, Lebanese officials did not release her nationality and age or details about the child she was travelling with. However, DNA tests have apparently confirmed that Baghdadi is the father. The woman is being questioned at the headquarters of the Lebanese defence ministry in Yarze, according to As-Safir. Earlier this year local media reported that al-Dulaimi was one of the wives of the barbaric group's reclusive leader, although it is unclear how many he has. Al-Dulaimi who reportedly worked as a hairdresser and a seamstress in Baghdad, is known to have at least three children. Her father Ibrahim Dulaimi was a so-called ISIS 'emir' in Syria who was reportedly killed in September 2013 during an operation against the Syrian army, according to the Al-Arabiya news channel. While, her sister, Duaa, was also allegedly behind a suicide attack that targeted a Kurdish gathering in the Irbil. After making significant gains earlier this year ISIS fighters have been pushed back by Iraqi and Kurdish forces and US airstrikes . Al-Dulami's identity was first revealed by Abu Maan al-Suri, a member of Syrian jihadist group al-Nusra, who claimed she had been part of a prisoner exchange, involving a group of nuns who were kidnapped months earlier in the historic Syrian town of Maaloulah. Whether she will be once again used as a bargaining chip is unknown, but the Lebanese government has come under increasing pressure to secure the release of some 20 soldiers and police officers kidnapped by ISIS and other militants during an August cross border raid. They already have killed three of the captives, beheading two and relatives of the captured men have surrounded the prime minister's office in Beirut with protest tents, demanding the government negotiate faster. After the militants threatened to kill all of them last month, the protesters turned violent, burning tires and blocking roads, causing hours of citywide gridlock. It is also unclear why Baghdadi would sanction her trip to Lebanon but ISIS strongholds in both Iraq and Syria have come under sustained attack in recent months. Aided by US airstrikes the militants have been repeatedly defeated by Iraqi troops, backed by Shiite and Kurdish militiamen. The ISIS leader, who has a $10 million bounty on his head, is known to be their prime target. Little is known about the early life of Baghdadi, the man now touted as the World's most prominent jihadist, although US data suggests he was born in Samarra in 1971. He apparently joined the insurgency that erupted shortly after the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, at one point spending time as a ‘civilian internee’ in Camp Bucca, a US-run prison in Garma. It is believed he was radicalized during the four years he spent in this camp, also known as the Birth Place of ISIS. He went on to revive the fortunes of Iraq's struggling Al Qaeda affiliate, turning it into the independent IS group, arguably the most brutal, powerful and wealthiest jihadist organisation in the world. Under his leadership, ISIS has spearheaded a militant offensive that has overrun much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland since June after seizing major territory in neighbouring Syria, and carried out a series of atrocities in both countries. During their rapid advance the Iraqi military virtually crumbled when confronted by the group, although ISIS have since been pegged back since the US airstrikes began. Declaring himself Caliph, Baghdadi made his first video appearance in Mosul in July to announce his vision for a self-styled caliphate, a form of Islamic state. It was rumored that he was killed or wounded by a US airstrike last month, but the group moved to quash this by releasing an audio recording purporting to be him, in which he encouraged militants to attack Saudi Arabia. Fearing a spread of the insurgency into their country, Lebanon has arrested a number of Islamic State militants suspected of carrying out attacks in a bid to expand the group's influence in the region. They have also been monitoring their borders closely in a bid to stem the flow of fighters attempting to join the conflict in Syria or those returning from battle.","The pair were arrested with the help of foreign intelligence .

"BEETHOVEN: ANGUISH AND TRIUMPH by Jane Swafford (Faber & Faber £30) Not many great men have been arrested as a tramp. But it happened more than once to Beethoven, because of his slovenly appearance. He would shout down the police cells with rage, ‘I am Beethoven’, until he was identified and released. Such stories encapsulate the problem of understanding him; so great a composer, so impossible and so unhappy a man. Beethoven seems to have lived his whole life over the top. In his frequent rages, as in his loves and his music, he was volcanic. Genius cannot be comfortable to live with. As this massive, but fascinating, biography shows, Beethoven quarrelled even with his best friends, invariably chose unattainable women to love and drove his ‘son’ — his nephew, Karl, to whom he was guardian — to attempt suicide. Without fail, Beethoven fell for much younger girls (17 was a favourite age) of aristocratic birth, usually titled, often married . Of course, the central tragedy of his life was his deafness, crippling to most composers, which he spent his adult life defying. More and more, he composed in his head, in a state of creative trance that he called his ‘raptus’. His deafness began in one of his rages at being disturbed. He fell flat on his face with fury. ‘When I got up, I found I was deaf, and have been ever since.’ Not entirely. His hearing partially returned, but accompanied by tinnitus, a constant hissing and buzzing in one or both ears. As sufferers, like myself, know only too well, it is incurable. ‘I would be happy, perhaps the happiest of mortals, if that fiend had not settled in my ears,’ he wrote to a doctor friend. His pupil, Ferdinand Ries, described how, one day, he found Beethoven on a sofa with an unknown young woman . At first, he found it impossible to tell people ‘I am deaf’, for fear it would ruin his reputation as the top-ranking virtuoso pianist and improviser in Vienna. He became famous almost from the start; his genius was evident to the music-loving Viennese. When deafness struck, he withdrew in embarrassment from public performance and society in general. Yet he carried on conducting the premieres of his new works — with more and more erratic results, as he could not hear the orchestra properly. Eventually, a substitute conductor would stand behind him, keeping the players together, while they did their best to ignore Beethoven’s antics. Of course, he could not hear the applause of the audience. He had to be turned around in order to see it. As well as increasing deafness, Beethoven suffered chronic ill-health. His biographer lists his complaints: colitis, vomiting and constant diarrhoea, rheumatic fever, jaundice, hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver — and an attack of typhus in his early years may have undermined his health. Swafford thinks he may have made his digestive troubles far worse by drinking quantities of cheap wine, which contained lead. But his short, squat, swarthy body was remarkably sturdy in standing up to all of this. He died of liver failure at the age of 56, a longish life for those times. It was sheer bloody-minded defiance that got him through, and which fought off his despair and frequent thoughts of suicide. ‘I will seize Fate by the throat — it shall not bend or crush me.’ Beethoven was lonely, but his loneliness was self-inflicted . He was lonely, but his loneliness was self-inflicted. His patrons were all Viennese aristocrats, led by the emperor’s brother, the Archduke Rudolph, who was his prize pupil. He and a couple of other princes clubbed together to provide Beethoven with a steady income — which was sometimes late in being paid, to Beethoven’s loud complaint. He despised aristocrats. To one of his patrons, he wrote, ‘Prince! What you are, you are by circumstance and by birth. What I am, I am through myself. Of princes there have been thousands; Of Beethoven there is only one.’ Ugly as he was, Beethoven easily attracted women. His pupil, Ferdinand Ries, described how, one day, he found Beethoven on a sofa with an unknown young woman. Ries had come for a lesson. Beethoven waved him to the piano: ‘Play something romantic’. Ries obliged, averting his eyes from the sofa. ‘Something passionate!’ urged Beethoven. Ries played on, until the woman made off. Beethoven said he had no idea who she was — she had knocked on the door and asked to see him. This happened, apparently, quite often. But his real love life, confined to three or four women, was a disaster. Without fail, he fell for much younger girls (17 was a favourite age) of aristocratic birth, usually titled, often married — hopeless prospects. Swafford gives short shrift to the love life in a book of more than 1,000 pages. He is a stickler for evidence, and we are short of hard evidence. There has been endless speculation, especially over the letter to ‘the Immortal Beloved’, which Beethoven never sent, but was found among his personal talismans after his death. This letter, almost incoherent in its longing — ‘My thoughts rush towards you . . . I can only live either wholly with you or not at all’ — suggests he was on his way to meet the beloved near Teplitz in Bohemia in the summer of 1812. but who was she? The style of the letter resembles that of the letters he sent to Josephine Deym, a young, widowed countess, nearly ten years earlier. Not many great men have been arrested as a tramp. But it happened more than once to Beethoven, because of his slovenly appearance . His anguished longings for her seemed to have been frustrated by her reluctance (in her letters) to go to bed with him, and her wish that, ‘If only you loved me less sensually’. Swafford sticks to the fact that they had parted five years before, and she had told her servants not to admit him anymore. There was no evidence that she was anywhere nearby when he wrote the letter to the immortal beloved. A t least three other possible candidates are considered and dismissed as unlikely fits. The mystery remains. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that he satisfied his sexual demands in Vienna’s fashionable brothels — along with some of his jocular men friends. But true love he had to abandon as an impossibility. He was alone with his deafness, which is why he sought a substitute family in his nephew Karl, the son of his brother, Johann, who made him the boy’s guardian before he died. Years that could have been spent in creation were eaten up by Beethoven’s attempts to keep the boy from his mother, whom he regarded as wicked and a whore. ‘He is my son: I am his true father,’ Beethoven declared, and he tried to shape the boy as he would a piece of music. The predictable result was that Karl, suffocating in his teenage years, ran away, leaving Beethoven in tears (‘He is ashamed of me!’). Then, he heard that Karl had tried, but failed, to kill himself, by attempting to shoot himself in the head with not one, but a pair of pistols. Beethoven’s attempts to be a father ended in remorse. Indeed, there is more anguish than triumph in the story told here. The triumph is given due weight in music. Swafford gives a thorough description and analysis of all the major works. He is a music academic, but also a composer. His comments are full of insight. He traces the development from Beethoven’s heroic period, through sadness, to the final mystic realm of the last quartets. At every stage, Beethoven stretched the bounds of music and of performance. This book is a monument. Though a long read, it is always rewarding, dealing as it does with a fascinating mystery — where does great music come from? How is it inspired? It certainly came out of suffering in Beethoven’s case. But it also ended with an Ode to Joy.","Beethoven was arrested more than once because he looked like a tramp .

"Vanessa Whitburn: She introduced racier plotlines to the long-running BBC Radio 4 show . The editor of The Archers is stepping down after 22 years leaving a legacy of racy storylines on controversial topics. Vanessa Whitburn, who is the longest serving editor in the Radio 4 soap’s history, will move on at the end of May. Under her stewardship, there have been a number of controversial storylines such as Ruth Archer’s affair with herdsman Sam Batton which upset some viewers to the extent it was said to have led to a drop in the show’s audience. Other notable storylines have included Nigel Pargetter plummeting to his death from a roof in the 60th anniversary edition. Miss Whitburn said: ‘I have had a wonderful time running the Archers, always interesting and exciting. ‘But I want to step down now in order to take a holiday, develop a project for TV drama and get involved in some more training overseas. ‘I leave the programme in good shape with some strong storylines planned. The BBC is a great place to work and I’ve been privileged to work with some very creative people along the way.’ Last year Miss Whitburn took several months off from the show after being given long-service leave. Gwyneth Williams, the controller of Radio 4, said: ‘Vanessa has been an excellent editor of The Archers over many years. ‘She has kept the nation’s longest-running drama at the heart of Radio 4 and we are very grateful to her. ‘She leaves Ambridge in good health with almost five million listeners eagerly looking forward to the next episode.’ Whitburn was responsible for the introduction of companion series, Ambridge Extra, on the digital sister station BBC Radio 4 Extra. In addition to her duties for the Archers, she has been responsible for Asian Network series Silver Street as well as many plays and serials for Radios 3 and 4. No successor has been named. The Archers is set in the fictional village of Ambridge, as mapped out in this official BBC map .

"The boss of one of the  polling firms trying to predict the outcome of the independence referendum today admitted they might have it completely wrong. In recent weeks the polls have narrowed to suggest the result is on a knife edge, with the latest poll of polls giving the Better Together campaign a 51 per cent to 49 per cent lead. But Martin Boon, director of ICM, has admitted he fears the unique background to the vote means polling data may have been corrupted, exposing the industry to its ‘Waterloo’. Scroll down for video . The latest Poll of Polls, compiled by political expert Professor John Curtice at WhatScotlandThinks.Com, puts the No campaign narrowly ahead on 51 per cent . ICM director Martin Boon has warned that the polls showing the Yes and No campaigns neck and neck could be completely wrong . It is feared the surge of support for the Yes campaign amongst people who don’t normally vote, and No supporters afraid of being accused of lacking patriotism misleading pollsters, are leading to a skewed picture being painted. Mr Boon admits he believes the actual result could see a much more comfortable victory for either side, and drew comparison with the 1992 general election, when the polls had Neil Kinnock set for a victory only for John Major to win. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘This referendum has the potential to be a polling Waterloo, the biggest since 1992 when the polls got it wrong. ‘I think and hope that the best that we in the industry can hope for is that we dodge a bullet, but it’s entirely possible the bullets do start spraying our way. ‘We are dependent on a pot of people which is defined, but we don’t know how big it is and in my view it won’t be big enough. The most recent ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph gives the Yes campaign a lead . Martin Boon,director of ICM, who has warned Scottish independence referendum polls could be totally inaccurate . ‘In that lies a real danger for the accuracy of the polls.’ The latest raft of opinion polls all point to differing results, but suggest the result is too close to call. A Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times put No on 50.6 per cent and Yes 49.4 per cent. A poll by Survation gave the No campaign an eight-point lead on 54 per cent to 46 per cent while an Opinium survey in The Observer put No on 53 per cent and Yes 47 per cent. However, a surprise ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph put the Yes campaign eight points ahead, on 54 per cent, although it was based on a survey size of only 700 people. More than 4.2million people have registered to vote in the historic referendum which will decide the fate of the 307-year-old Union. Experts predict the turnout could be as high as 85 per cent. Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted internal campaign research put them comfortably ahead, but he suggested half a million people in Scotland have not decided how to vote with opinion polls suggesting the race is neck and neck. A surge in Yes voters may not have been picked up by the polls because a lot of the support has come from people who do not normally vote, and so are not likely to have been polled. Of the six companies that are polling, four use online panels, one does face-to-face canvassing and another does phone interviews. Figures showing Yes support might be underestimated because young voters are less likely to sit down to answer online questions, or stop in the street and speak to canvassers. They are also less likely to have their own phone line and therefore are missed by polling using that method. It is believed the No figures could be inaccurate because of so called 'shy Nos' who are afraid of letting people know they are against independence. With the Yes campaign being so rooted in Scottish nationalism, many No voters are concerned that it can appear unpatriotic to be against Scotland going alone. This means that when asked the question by a pollster, a No voter may say they are undecided or even that they are going to vote Yes, out of fear they will appear unpatriotic. However, these 'shy Nos' have every intention of voting against independence in the privacy of the polling booth, so the real figures of No voters could be much higher.","Polls show the Yes and Better Together campaigns neck and neck .

"Eating only within an eight-hour window each day could help you shed weight, a study has found. Limiting the times you eat could reverse obesity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. And it doesn’t even matter whether you have fatty or sugary foods. The eight-hour limit seems to undo the harm done by an unhealthy diet. Researchers believe that sticking to strict meal times allows the body to predict when it will eat – meaning it is better prepared to burn calories. Scroll down for video . Watching the clock: Eating within a regular eight hour time frame each day can aid weighty loss . Mice fed a high-fat diet within an eight hour time frame – for example between 9am and 5pm – were both healthier and slimmer than those given the same number of calories throughout the whole day. Even when obese mice had their eating window reduced to nine hours, they were able to drop 5 per cent of their body weight within a few days – while still enjoying the same amount of calories. The research was carried out at the Salk Institute in California. The scientists think that allowing the body to predict regular meal times helps it synchronise the digestive system with genes and proteins, preparing it to process food. It also affects the balance of bacteria found in the gut which control metabolism. The findings, published in the journal Cell Metabolism, add to mounting evidence that when we eat is just as important to health as what we eat. Professor Satchin Panda, who led the study, said: ‘Most of the advice is, “You have to change nutrition, you have to eat a healthy diet.” But many people don’t have access to healthy diets. ‘So the question is, without access to a healthy diet, can they still practise time-restricted feeding and reap some benefit?’ He added: ‘We found that animals fed within a window of eight to 12 hours had a number of protective and therapeutic health benefits compared with animals allowed to eat the same number of calories from the same food source at any time.’ The protective effects were maintained even during ‘cheat days’ – when the mice were allowed unrestricted food over the weekends. This is good news for dieters. It suggests that an occasional lapse won’t do any real harm.","Limiting eating to an eight-hour window can help people shed weight .

"A 16-year-old junior at an Ohio High School was arrested Monday for carrying a loaded weapon that he told police he was planning to use to 'open fire' on students, officials said. Police said that a classmate at Fremont High first noticed the handgun  and contacted authorities, who placed the school on lockdown after confirming the student had a weapon. 'After interviewing the subject, he admitted to detectives that he brought the gun to school with the intent to shoot a particular student and then open fire on the rest of the school,' Weber County Sheriff's Sgt Lane Findlay told Deseret News. Scroll down for video . Lockdown: Good4Utah reports that police placed Fremont High on lockdown after a 16-year-old junior was discovered with a loaded handgun, which he told officers he planned to use to 'open fire' on students . The student reportedly planned to shoot a girl he had a relationship with in the past, and police contacted both the girl and her family to make them aware. 'Obviously they were quite shaken by this,' Findlay said. Deputies arrived at the school just after 12pm, responding to the classmate's concern about a gun, which the student was reportedly carrying in his waistband. A school resource officer spoke to the armed student, who was cooperative and confirmed he had a gun, and called for a lockdown. 'There was a little bit of concern initially if he was just alone and had the gun or if there was possibly another threat,' Findlay said. Officers conducted a four hour sweep of the school, evacuating classrooms one by one, after the student initially told officers he did not know if there was another person involved. Evacuation: Officers swept Fremont for around four hours, evacuating classrooms one by one, due to initial fears there were additional people involved with the plan . 'They took us out in the hallway, the SWAT team did, and they put us against the wall. They were searching our pants, our legs and everything, making sure we didn't have anything,' said sophomore Mitch Wall. 'You never think, you know in a farm community, this town out here's pretty quiet … that something like this would happen,' said one parent Shelly Beesley. The student was brought to juvenile detention as police investigate charges of possession of a weapon with intent to assault, possession of a firearm in a restricted area, and possession of a firearm by a minor, all misdemeanors. The incident comes a little more than a week after the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by a rookie police officer in Cleveland. Video released by police showed officers driving up next to Rice, who was in possession of an Airsoft pistol with the orange safety cap reportedly removed, and firing two shots at Rice within seconds of arrival.","The Fremont High student was reportedly carrying a loaded handgun in his waistband .

"An American man accused of sexually abusing Kenyan children and circulating the images on the internet will now die behind bars after being sentenced to 50 years in jail. Terry Ray Krieger, 59, was arrested in October after Interpol tipped off Kenyan police about an internet user in the country who went by the alias 'Babytoddler123' and was making and distributing pedophile material for overseas users. His arrest came after Interpol investigations in Germany and the United States. Krieger, from the state of Michigan, had initially denied the charges but then changed his plea to guilty last month. Behind bars for life: A Kenyan court has sentenced US citizen Terry Ray Kreiger to 50 years in jail for distributing child poronography . Guilty: Krieger, who was arrested in Kenya in October, was charged with one count of circulating obscene publications depicting images of a child in contravention of Section 16(1)(a) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006 . Terry Ray Krieger, pictured at a Nairobi court after facing charges relating to child pornography, appeared to be wearing a wedding ring at his trial . His victims are aged between three and 10 and are from the area where Krieger lives in Olepolos in Ngong, Kajiado County, according to Daily Nation. 'Children occupy a special place in society and their rights must be protected,' Nairobi Magistrate Joseph Karanja told the court. 'The accused has robbed young children of their innocence and it is disturbing that these despicable acts have been going on undetected,' he said, dismissing the wheelchair-bound Krieger's contention that he was a paraplegic and should be shown some leniency. Krieger allegedly exchanged 36 files between December 7, 2013 and May 18, 2014. He would use online media platforms GigaTribe, Yahoo Chat and Skype to send the images. Charged: The prosecutor reads out the charges to Terry Krieger in Nairobi court . Krieger was also identified as a repeat offender, having been convicted in 1992 in the United States for criminal sexual conduct with an under 13, for which he served three years in prison. He was released in 1995. The minimum sentence under Kenyan law is six years, but the judge ruled Krieger should face a maximum possible term of 50 years - meaning he will likely die behind bars.","Terry Ray Krieger, 59, of Michigan, is a convicted sex offender .

"Ever wanted a job that will advance the course of human history while also let you drive a John Deere tractor? Then SpaceX has the perfect opening for you. The private space company founded by Elon Musk, the co-founder of PayPal, is advertising to fill a rather unusual role - a farmer with some rather lofty ambitions. In a job advert that conjures up images of Matthew McConaughey’s farming space explorer in the film Interstellar, SpaceX says it is looking for a farmer with a rare mix of ‘drive, passion, scrappiness, intelligence and curiosity to seek what’s beyond the stars’. Scroll down for video . SpaceX's farmer will need to organise crop production on its 900 acre rocket research base in MacGregor, Texas around the hectic schedule of tests on rockets like the Grasshopper that hovers above the site . However, candidates should not get their hopes up too much. Rather than taking a key role producing food on the first colony on Mars, they will instead be harvesting crops on the land around the company’s 900 acre rocket base in MacGregor, Texas. SpaceX insists, however, that the successful candidate will play a ‘direct role in advancing the course of human history’ and will join a team whose aim is to ‘pave the way to Mars’. Headed with the title ‘Engineer the Future’, the job advert says candidates will need at least 10 years of experience of crop farming and have detailed knowledge John Deere machinery. The job description also warns that anyone who is successful will be need to work ‘extremely flexible’ hours and will be exposed to environments that involve dirt, odours, noise and weather extremes ‘or similar elements’ through most of their working day. Applicants will also need to be able to climb ladders, work in tight spaces and lift objects of up to 50lbs. The advert says: ‘This is SpaceX. We are not like most companies. Our goal is to do what has never before been done - enabling mankind to live on other planets. ‘We push the boundaries of what is currently possible, and understand it takes rare individuals to help us make this happen. Matthew McConaughey plays a farmer who dreams of leaving Earth for space in Christopher Nolan's bleak film on the future of our planet Interstellar, but the SpaceX role is unlikely to involve much spaceflight . ‘We celebrate our successes, and each other. We seek future colleagues with a rare mix of drive, passion, scrappiness, intelligence, and curiosity to seek what’s beyond the stars. ‘Playing a direct role in advancing the course of human history is no small endeavor. Join us, and find your place in the SpaceX legacy.’ Nasa's Veg01 experiment uses a low-cost plant growth chamber that features a flat panel of LED lights. These produce red, blue and green light to allow the plants to grow. Lettuce and radish seeds were placed inside specially designed prototype 'flight pillows' to help encourage their growth, which were then placed on root mats. The pillows were made from Teflon-coated Kevlar and Nomex, which contained soil, clay and fertilizer pellets. Water was then added to the root mat to begin seed germination and this is then carefully controlled as the plants grow. The growth chamber also features bellows to help regulate air flow over the plants and maintain the correct humidity. Astronauts on board the ISS have been monitoring the seedlings since they arrived in April for health, size, the amount of water they use and microorganisms growing on them. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Musk to build private rockets and spacecraft. In 2008 it put the first privately funded rocket into orbit and then in 2012 its Dragon spacecraft became the first private mission to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. Nasa, which has seen its own launch capacity dented by budget cuts, has turned to SpaceX to help supplies to the space station. It has also awarded SpaceX a share of a contract with Boeing to develop a 'space taxi' that will carry US astronauts into orbit. SpaceX now employs more than 3,000 people in its headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and facilities in Florida, Texas and Washington, DC. While most people involved in the space industry tend to be scientists and engineers, SpaceX is now seeking employees with more earth based experience. They want farmers with a minimum of 10 years of row crop farming experience in the central Texas area and a working knowledge of 'every process required for crop production in the region'. Candidates also need experience in repairing and maintaining John Deere agricultural equipment. Their responsibilities will include planning farm production, increasing the quality of crop yields, making contingency plans for variable weather conditions and using electronic spreadsheets. But they warn that the farmer will be required to work around test launch schedules at the MacGregor facility, where SpaceX carries out research and development on its Falcon 9 rockets. The advert says: 'This position will be required to work around test schedules as necessary to ensure the successful crop production does not interfere with testing progress.' This may be no small task - recent tests of SpaceX's Grasshoppper rocket saw the 106 feet tall rocket 'hop' 330 feet to the side. However, SpaceX is not the first space organisation to dabble in agriculture. Nasa has been developing technologies to allow astronauts to grow food on the ISS and in the space shuttle. In April this year Nasa sent its Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) to the ISS on board SpaceX's Dragon cargo vessel. It will be used in an experiment, called Veg01, to see how red romaine lettuce grows in the low gravity environment of space.

"In 1975 astronomers Dr Kip Thorne and Dr Anna Żytkow predicted the existence of a star within a star, dubbed a Thorne-Żytkow object. They suggested one would form when a neutron star collided with a supergiant, being swallowed inside its huge companion. And now almost 40 years later the evidence for such an object has been found, providing astronomers with a fascinating and bizarre new space object to study. Astronomers have found a strange double star using a telescope in Chile. The so-called Thorne-Żytkow object consists of a neutron star that was swallowed by a much larger red supergiant. This can occur if two stars are orbiting each other, as shown in this illustration, and one is pushed into the other . Thorne-Żytkow objects (TŻOs) are hybrids of red supergiant and neutron stars that, from the outside, resemble regular red supergiants such as Betelgeuse in Orion. Their chemical signatures are different from such stars, however, due to the unique activity taking place inside. And amazingly, while regular stars are powered by nuclear fusion in their cores, TŻOs are actually powered by the absorbed neutron star. The discovery of one of these incredible objects was announced earlier this year, reports Amy Teitel for Motherboard. The astronomers made their discovery with the 6.5-metre (21.3 feet) Magellan Clay telescope on Las Campanas in Chile. They examined the spectrum of light emitted from apparent red supergiants, which tells them what elements are present. When the spectrum of one particular star - HV 2112 in the Small Magellanic Cloud 200,000 light-years away - was first displayed, the observers were quite surprised by some of the unusual features. Such objects were first predicted to exist in 1975 by astronomers Dr Kip Thorne and Dr Anna Żytkow. They are thought to occur when a neutron star (shown in illustration) collides with a red supergiant and is absorbed. The exact process by which this happens though is not well understood . Project leader Dr Emily Levesque of the University of Colorado Boulder and her colleagues took a close look at the subtle lines in the spectrum and found that it contained excess rubidium, lithium and molybdenum. When the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life, protons and electrons are literally scrunched together, leaving behind one of nature's most wondrous creations: a neutron star. Neutron stars cram roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city-sized sphere perhaps 12 miles (20 kilometers) across. Matter is packed so tightly that a sugar-cube-sized amount of material would weigh more than 1 billion tons, about the same as Mount Everest. Source: nasa.gov . Past research has shown that normal stellar processes can create each of these elements, but high abundances of all three of these at the temperatures typical of red supergiants is a unique signature of TŻOs. ‘Studying these objects is exciting because it represents a completely new model of how stellar interiors can work,’ said Dr Levesque. ‘In these interiors we also have a new way of producing heavy elements in our universe. ‘You've heard that everything is made of “star stuff” - inside these stars we might now have a new way to make some of it.’ And Dr Żytkow, who has now seen her prediction be validated, said: ‘I am extremely happy that observational confirmation of our theoretical prediction has started to emerge.’ ‘Since Kip Thorne and I proposed our models of stars with neutron cores, people were not able to disprove our work. ‘If theory is sound, experimental confirmation shows up sooner or later. ‘So it was a matter of identification of a promising group of stars, getting telescope time and proceeding with the project.’ The astronomers made their discovery with the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope on Las Campanas, in Chile (pictured). They examined the spectrum of light emitted from apparent red supergiants, which tells them what elements are present, and found one called HV 2112 was likely one of these bizarre hybrid objects . The team is careful to point out that HV 2112 displays some chemical characteristics that don't quite match theoretical models. Co-author of the study Dr Philip Massey of Lowell Observatory in Flagstarr, Arizona points out: ‘We could, of course, be wrong. ‘There are some minor inconsistencies between some of the details of what we found and what theory predicts. ‘But the theoretical predictions are quite old, and there have been a lot of improvements in the theory since then. ‘Hopefully our discovery will spur additional work on the theoretical side now.’","Astronomers have found a strange hybrid star using a telescope in Chile .

"Professional polo player Nic Roldan has revealed his plans to try and change society's view of his sport, which he admits many see as elitist, expensive and overly flashy. In an interview with luxury menswear website Mr Porter, the 31-year-old, who is ranked the number one polo player in the US, explained that polo is not just about wealthy athletes enjoying a glamorous lifestyle - and insisted that the sport can be pursued by almost anyone. 'A lot of people think of polo as a lifestyle and not an actual sport,' he said. '[I'm on a mission to] bring the masses towards the sport. It's not just about horses and divorces: Nic insists that there is more to the sport than glamour and luxury . Hard working: The 31-year-old looks after 30 polo ponies and travels for half of the year . '...Who knows if polo will get to the magnitude of tennis or golf – but I think it has the potential to grow.' But while he is eager to help alter the public perception of the sport, Nic does admit that he has indulged in the more lavish aspects of the polo lifestyle. Having been rocketed to sporting stardom at age 15, when he became the youngest ever player to win the US Open Polo Championship, the sporting legend quickly allowed himself to become caught up in a world of jet-set luxury and excitement. 'I arrive [at a tournement] and I have a car, an apartment on the ocean, no parental guidance,' he said of his teen years spent on the international polo circuit. 'I think, ""Wow, this is fun. I can keep doing this.""' Model behavior: Nic has starred in numerous campaigns for Ralph Lauren's Black Label and is represented by New York-based agency Wilhelmina Models . Social butterfly: Nic ensures he puts in as much effort socializing with the other players and team owners as he does focusing on the game itself . Nowadays, Nic tends to live a slightly more low-key lifestyle, focusing on his playing schedule, his strict training regime - and, most importantly, caring for his 30 polo ponies. The part-time model, who has starred in numerous campaigns for Ralph Lauren's Black Label and is represented by New York-based agency Wilhelmina Models, spends half of the year traveling to matches. During that time, Nic ensures he puts in as much effort socializing with the other players and team owners - which he sees as a 'vital' aspect of polo - as he does focusing on the game itself. 'The owners do it because they love the sport, and horses, but they also love what it brings – the dinners and cocktail parties,' he explained. 'So as an athlete, you have to be very sociable. I love it. It’s always come naturally for me.' Polo prodigy: Nic became the youngest player to ever win the US Open when he stormed to victory aged 15 . Aiming for the top: Nic’s ambition is to reach 10-goal status and win the Argentine Open . And while NIc has now spent more than half his life on the professional polo circuit, he is in no rush to give up the sport any time soon - and, in fact, is hoping to achieve much more within the sport before he even considers retiring. The New York-based athlete is one of only five players in the world to hold an eight-goal handicap in the sport, and he is only the third American in history to have achieved that status. But while his past achievements are impressive, Nic is working towards become one of the few players to ever achieve a 10-goal handicap. 'Nic’s ambition is to reach 10-goal status, win the Argentine Open, claim a second U.S. Open Polo Championship victory and propel popularity for the sport,' his website states.","Nic is ranked as the top professional player in the country .

"Ben Affleck clashed with Bill Maher during a heated discussion on Islam where the controversial TV host claimed being a member of the religion is like being in the Mafia. The Oscar-winning director was also appalled when author and guest on the talk show Sam Harris said the Muslim faith was the 'motherload of bad ideas'. The trio, appearing on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday, collided while debating whether large numbers of the Muslim population share the beliefs of jihadists. It led to the actor saying: 'It's just an ugly thing to say. It's gross, it's racist. It's like saying: ""Oh you shifty Jew"".' Scroll down for video . Angry reaction: Ben Affleck responds after another guest on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher suggests that Islam is the 'motherload of bad ideas' The conversation started with Harris, who was promoting his book Waking Up, by saying: 'Liberals have failed on the topic of theocracy. They'll criticize white theocracy, they'll criticize Christianity. They still get agitated over the abortion clinic bombing that happened in 1984. 'The crucial point of confusion is we have been sold this meme of Islamaphobia - where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam is conflated with bigatory towards Muslims as people. Which is intellectually ridiculous. Affleck responds by saying: 'Are you the person who understands the officially codified doctrine of Islam. Harris then returns by saying 'I am actually well educated in this subject' before Affleck says: 'You are saying that Islamaphobia is not a real thing?' Maher then says: 'That's not what we are saying' before Harris adds: 'We have to be able to criticize bad ideas and Islam is the motherload of bad ideas.' The Gone Girl star then sits back in his chair in shock and adds 'It's an ugly thing to say.' Maher continues the conversation: 'Lets get down to who has the right answer. A billion people you say, all these people don't hold these pernicious beliefs. That's just not true Ben, that's just not true. 'You say its down to these few bad apples, but the idea that someone should be killed if they leave the Islamic religion is just a few bad apples...' Affleck then says: 'The people who actually believe that you should murder someone if you dishonor the Islamic faith is not with the majority of Muslims at all. Explaining the the proportions of followers who believe in certain ideals, Harris says: 'At the center of the circle you have jihadists who wake up ion the morning wanting to kill apostates, wanting to die trying, they believe in paradise, they believe in martyrdom. 'Outside of this you have Islamists. People who are just convinced of matryrdom and paradise and wanting to force their religion on the rest of humanity. 'But they want to work with in the system and they are not willing to blow themselves up on a bus. They want to change governments, they want to use democracy against itself. 'Those two circles are arguably 20 per cent of the Muslim world. Based on a bunch of polls that we can talk about. 'To give you one point of contact, 78 per cent of British Muslims said the Danish cartoonist (who was accused of depicting the prophet Mohammad in an animation) should have been prosecuted.' Host Bill Maher (left) said that following Islam was like being a member of the Mafia while author Sam Harris (right) claimed Islamaphobia was just a 'meme' 'But outside of that we have conservative Muslims who say that ISIS does not represent us, that we are horrified by that. But they hold views about human rights and about women and about homosexuals are deeply troubling. 'These are not Islamists, these are not jihadists. They also keep women and homosexuals immiserated in those cultures. 'And we have to empower the true Muslim reformers in the world to change it. This behaviour is not going to do that. Journalist Nicholas Kristof then cuts in, telling Maher he was painting an 'incomplete' picture of the religion by failing to account reformers like activist Malala Yousafzai. 'Or how about the more than a billion people who aren't fanatical, who don't punish women, who just want to go to school, have some sandwiches, and don't do any of the things you say all Muslims do?' Affleck adds. Maher responds to this by saying: 'One reason they (other views) don't get exposed is because they are afraid to speak out. Because it's the only religion that acts like the Mafia. That will f***ing kill if you say the wrong thing, draw the wrong picture or write the wrong book.' Seeking an explanation, Affleck then asks the panelists: 'What is you answer? Is it just to condemn Islam? We've killed more Muslims than they have killed us by an awful lot. 'Yet somehow we are exempt from these things. Because they are not really a reflection of what we believe in. He then said sarcastically: 'It was by accident, that's how we invaded Iraq. I am explicitly telling you that I disagree with what you think. But Maher disparagingly tells the actor: 'We are obviously not convincing anyone here.'","Heated discussion took place on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher on Friday .

"A toddler who was born with no face is being given the chance to live a normal life thanks to the help of the same  surgeon who separated Bangladeshi-born conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna. Three-year-old Yahya El Jabaly was born with no eyes, a hole in the middle of his face where his nose should be and no upper jaw. The Moroccan born toddler, who lives in a small village six hours from Casablanca, was born deformed after complications in the womb stopped the bones in his face from fusing together. Scroll down for video . Yahya El Jabaly was born with no eyes, a hole in the middle of his face where his nose should be and no upper jaw . The three-year-old boy lives in a small village six hours from Casablanca,in Morocco with his parents . Despite his incredibly rare condition, Yahya managed to survive and grow into a happy and healthy toddler through the support of his adoring mother and father. However socially, he is automatically an outcast as his appearance is considered too confronting for many. The toddler's face is covered up whenever he leaves his small village and, due to lacking the roof of his mouth, he is unable to speak and can only communicate through grunts. Yahya's plight first went global when the father of his closest friend took to Facebook, pleading for medical professionals to help the boy lead a normal life. Despite being happy, healthy and adored by his parents (pictured) the toddler's face is covered whenever he leaves his town due to his appearance being too confronting for many . 'I just want my child to look as normal as possible so he can go outside and play with the other kids,' his father said . From across the world, the post was read by Fatima Baraka, a Melbourne breast cancer survivor who was born in a village close to Yahya's. 'He's entered my heart...I'm so in love with this little boy,' Ms Baraka told Channel Seven's Sunday Night. 'There was a big phone number in red [on the post], it was quite obvious that it was a cry for help of some sort and I found myself reaching for the phone and calling the number. 'He [Yahya's father] said ""I just want my child to look as normal as possible so he can go outside and play with the other kids"".' Fatima Baraka, a Melbourne breast cancer survivor, heard of his story on Facebook and took it upon herself to help Yahya by flying him to Australia . 'There was a big phone number in red, it was quite obvious that it was a cry for help of some sort and I found myself reaching for the phone and calling the number,' Ms Baraka said of the message which was posted by Yahya's neighbour . Ms Baraka took it upon herself to search for a surgeon who would be willing to transform Yahya's face and soon found Melbourne reconstructive surgeon, Tony Holmes who separated Bangladeshi-born conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna. She then travelled to Yahya's home where she met the toddler and his family for the first time before bringing them to Australia. 'I was quite shocked. I didn't think I would be shocked but I was,' Ms Baraka said of her first meeting with the family. 'I was a little bit horrified to be honest.' Dr Tony Holmes, who separated Bangladeshi-born twins Trishna and Krishna, will operate on Yahya in December . He completed a range of tests on Yahya in Melbourne, including CT and MRI scans, to see if he was suitable for surgery . Yahya and his parents also met Dr Holmes after being flown to Melbourne where the three-year-old underwent a range of developmental tests from CT scans to MRI's, to confirm how his brain functions and if he was suitable for surgery. Despite the serious risks involved, Dr Holmes soon agreed to operate on the toddler. 'He may not die if we don't operate on him, but he might if we do,' Dr Holmes told Channel Seven's Sunday Night. The operation will bring the two sides of Yahya's skull together and shape him a nose from his own skin . 'I believe that it’s the right of everybody to look human and this kid doesn't look human,' Dr Holmes said . 'I believe that it’s the right of everybody to look human and this kid doesn't look human.' Yahya will undergo surgery in December, when Dr Holmes plans to bring the two sides of his skull together and build him a nose with his own skin. There is also a chance that the toddler will be able to speak after the procedure due to his vocal chords remaining intact. 'We're not experimenting on him, we want to get a good result,' Dr Holmes said.","Yahya  was born with no eyes, a hole in the middle of his face where his nose should be and no upper jaw due to complications in the womb .

"It's time to dump those dumbbells boys as a new survey has revealed that having a muscular physique will get you nowhere when it comes to dating apps. A study has revealed that women who use Tinder are more likely to swipe right to metrosexual men than beefed up bodies. The results also found that women are likely to shun other stereotypes such as a hipster, rocker or 'lad' in favour of a vainer man. Scroll down for video . Well presented: The metrosexual man profile received the most matches out of the four stereotypes . The discovery comes as a result of an experiment conducted by party planner firm Hen Heaven to try to decipher what kind of men make desirable matches. Four male profiles were created for each stereotype, gym buff, rocker, lad and metrosexual using the same model. Each profile ran from the same location in Brighton, East Sussex, for a fortnight with the Tinder age range set as 18-35 and the distance was set to 18km (11.1 miles) for each of the five profiles. Not so hot: The gym buff ranked worst out of the group with just 42 matches . Over the course of the two weeks that the profiles were live, the names, ages and messages from each woman that matched with the men were documented. The mature metrosexual account received 241 matches (39.4 per cent). The average age of the potential partners was 23-and-a-half years old. Meanwhile women are the least keen on the gym buff type, whose profile only received 42 matches (6.8 per cent). The research revealed that women are more likely to swipe right to a man who is well groomed . The typical Jack-the-lad still remains a popular choice for the ladies, with 124 women expressing their desire to meet up with the model in the lad account. The cool, smoking hipster received 105 matches while the fashionable rocker attracted 99 matches on the dating app. Relationship expert Caroline Brealey says that the appeal of the metrosexual is simply down to good old-fashioned aesthetics. 'Metrosexuals are easily spotted in a crowd because they look good. They probably have enough products in their bathroom to rival Boots and it definitely shows, because this man likes to look his best at all times.' Caroline added that although women are initially attracted to well-groomed types they can prove problematic when it comes to actual relationships. 'The obvious down sides can be vanity and fights over bathroom time (and products).' However she also pointed out that if his approach to relationships is similar to his dedication to his appearance, he could make a promising partner. 'If his attention to detail flows over into other areas of his life, he'll be an attentive boyfriend who cares about the little things, from taking your coat to buying you thoughtful gifts. 'If you also take pride in your appearance and value setting off to the more prestigious places to eat, drink and spend your holidays, you'll be a perfect fit.' Caroline says that when it comes to impressing the well-turned-out man they look for a similar level of upkeep with their women. 'Generally speaking, metrosexual men are drawn to women that let their femininity out and are essentially the glam version of the girl next door.' Take it or leave it: The rocker (left) received 99 matches while the trendy hipster (right) ranked up 105 . Popular choice: The typical jack the lad image came in second with 141 women expressing interest . Caroline added that daters are probably making the right choice if they have a penchant for pristine men as gym bunnies tend to put their women second. 'If you're not happy catering to the gym buff's meal plans and coming second to the weights, treadmills and cross trainers, he's probably not for you. 'Gym buffs are most definitely suited to girls who like to keep fit, as they will be able to co-ordinate schedules and push each other to do their best and stay in shape. 'Having to fit his gym sessions into daily life might be a chore at times.' When it comes to the 'lad', Caroline says that there family values and sociable nature can make them a suitable mate. 'Extremely friend and family orientated, with the right girl, the ""lad"" can be the right guy. 'His friends will be at his core - from trips to see his football team play to Saturday nights largely being reserved for the weekly ""big night out"" - meaning he will of course suit a lady with a similar lifestyle, who isn't waiting at home for a text and fretting over what he's up to. 'It isn't all glugging beers and chanting at the football, though, because he'll probably be very close to his family behind all the bravado.'","Women prefer well-groomed men over those with a 'buff' physique .

"Homeland Security . Secretary Jeh Johnson on Tuesday defended to Congress the Obama . administration's decision to allow millions of illegal immigrants relief from deportation even as conservatives on Capitol Hill aggressively pushed to defund parts of his department. Johnson spoke at a hearing before the House Committee on . Homeland Security that marked the first public hearing on President Barack Obama's . executive actions, which are expected to allow as many as five million immigrants to remain in the United States indefinitely, since he announced them late last month. The DHS head begged lawmakers today not to express their anger at the president and the administration over immigration through the appropriations process. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testifies on Capitol Hill on Tuesday before the House Homeland Security Committee on the impact of President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration . Johnson told them he could not run his department with the type of short-term spending bill that conservatives on Capitol Hill are considering. 'That is in my judgement a very bad idea for Homeland Security because during that period of a continuing resolution we cannot engage in new starts,' he told them. 'We've got some Homeland Security priorities that need to be funded now. The department head pointed out that a new presidential election cycle is about to being and he wouldn't be able to hire new Secret Service agents to protect candidates until DHS is fully funded for the entire fiscal year. Furthermore, he said he wouldn't be able to fund 'our enhanced detention capability in Texas with another continuing resolution that gets me to March.' 'I need the help of Congress to support and build upon border security, which I believe all of you support,' he said. 'So, I'm urging that we act on our current appropriations request now for the purpose and for the sake of border security and homeland security,' Johnson concluded. Republicans in the House and Senate who are deeply opposed to providing amnesty to illegal immigrants have been lobbying their colleagues to pass appropriations legislation that would only fund the Department of Homeland Security through early 2015, when they take control of both chambers of Congress. At that time they would be able to insert language into a long-term spending bill that would hinge funding for certain immigration agencies and operations on ceasing implementation of Obama's immigration actions. House Speaker John Boehner reportedly endorsed the plan in a closed-door meeting today, setting up his party's attempt to block the president's immigration policy in January and a head-to-head fight with the White House. At a press briefing afterward he said his conference had not coalesced around a specific plan yet, however. 'I said before Thanksgiving that Republicans would fight his unilateral actions,' the GOP leader said. 'We’re looking at a variety of options, both for right now and when Republicans control both Houses of the Congress next year. And we’ll continue to discuss with our members a number of options, in terms of how we will deal with this, in consultation, again, with the members. 'But no decisions have been made at this point,' he added. If Congress doesn't pass new spending legislation by Dec. 11 the federal government will shut down until it does. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been adamant that won't happen, saying again today a shut down is not in the cards. However, he confirmed that Republicans, who are currently the minority in the Senate, would support whatever bill their colleagues in the House sent over. 'In the short-term, the Senate will be in a reactive role, he said. 'Next year, we'll be sort-of more co-equal partners on that issue. 'But right now, our view is once it's sorted out in the House, once it gets passed, I'll be supportive of that.' The White House has made its preference that legislators pass a yearlong spending bill for all government agencies known several times over. Certainty is good for the economy, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said today. 'Were hopeful that Republicans will follow their own advice in that regard and pass a full-year fed budget,' he added. Earnest said White House officials 'certainly take some heart' in McConnell's promises that there will not be a government shutdown next week. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said after a  House Republican caucus meeting at the Capitol today that his members had not yet determined how it planned to avoid another politically damaging shutdown while holding the president accountable for his immigration actions . Republicans on Capitol Hill unleashed their fury over the immigration actions today at Johnson. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, there’s a right way to do this and a wrong way,' the committee's chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul said. 'This is not how democracy works.' Johnson told the committee he recommended each . action Obama took and continues to stand behind them. 'The reality is that, given our limited resources, these . people are not priorities for removal,' he said. McCaul, a Republican, said the president's directive would be perceived as . amnesty to those considering crossing the U.S.  border with Mexico, though. 'If we don't think that message is making its way back to . Mexico and Central America, we are simply fooling ourselves,' he said. 'We will see a wave of illegal immigration because . of the president's actions.' Johnson said the new measures are not amnesty. 'The current situation is amnesty,' he said . Furthermore, he said administration officials 'feel that we had no choice' to act given that Congress couldn't come to an agreement on comprehensive reform of its own. McCaul argued that Obama did not have the authority to authorize the order, however. In response, Johnson defended the legality of the action, saying those . who drafted the plan worked closely with the Justice . Department's Office of Legal Counsel. 'I’m satisfied as a lawyer myself — and the person who has to come here and defend these actions — that what we have done is well within our existing legal authority,' he told the committee. The White House said today it was not surprised that the GOP tore into Johnson. 'Republicans have long...adopted the view - that's contrary to the view of the vast majority of Americans - that we shouldnt reform our broken immigration system,' he said. Their views on immigration are 'stark contrasts' to those of the president, law enforcement officials, faith leaders, and even some of their fellow Republicans, he added. Later in his briefing on Tuesday Earnest told reporters, 'the fact is the closest thing we have to amnesty in this country is doing nothing.' And that's exactly what Republicans seem to be doing, he charged.","Department of Homeland Security head Jeh Johnson spoke at a hearing before the House Committee on Homeland Security .

"Thousands  of parents are naming their babies after Downton Abbey characters, new figures have revealed. The TV show's huge popularity has inspired a resurgence of 1920s fashion and hairstyles, and now the old-fashioned names of its characters are also back in vogue. Edith, Cora, Sybil and Elsie are all soaring in popularity among new parents. Scroll down for video . The popularity of Downton characters like Lady Mary (l) and Lady Edith is being reflected in baby names . The first name of the Countess of Grantham, Cora, is soaring in popularity among new parents . But when the show began in 2010, the monikers were in danger of dwindling into obscurity. It is now just finished its fifth season running on Sunday night attracting around eight million viewers per episode. Violet, the first name of the matriarchal Dowager Countess of Grantham played by Dame Maggie Smith, has seen a particularly large comeback after it made the top 100 girls' names for 2013. Spiralling from 466 girls in 2010 to 709 last year, it has jumped in the national rankings from 123rd to 78th. And highest of all was Elsie, the Christian name of housekeeper Mrs Hughes, which has rocketed into the thousands in just five years. Nearly 1,200 babies took the name last year compared to 535 in 2010. Violet, the first name of the matriarchal Dowager Countess of Grantham played by Dame Maggie Smith, has seen a particularly large comeback after it made the top 100 girls' names for 2013 . Parenting expert Dr Fin Williams, who founded the group Parent Perspectives based in Devon, was unsurprised by the trend. She said: 'We pick up our preferences for names based on who we are surrounded by but also our experiences of TV characters who have that name. 'We are less likely to name our children after someone who we feel hasn't got a very nice character, and more likely to name them after somebody we aspire to.' Judy Reith, parenting coach and founder of parentingpeople.co.uk, said: 'I think parents have always been interested in fashion and sometimes fashion is led by television programmes and celebrities, especially in the current age. Downton has just finished its fifth season, attracting around 8 million viewers per episode . 'I'm not surprised that Downton Abbey is having an influence, and I'm sure the the royal baby will also have an influence next year.' Cora, the warm-hearted countess of Grantham, and Sybil, her pretty and modest daughter, are among the names that have rocketed. The figures, released by the Office of National Statistics, show a 55 per cent increase in the number of girls called Cora in England and Wales, while there are now treble the number of Sybils than there were in 2010. The name Mary - the lead character of the show played by Michelle Dockery - has bucked the trend with a slight decline - just 203 girls were given the name in 2013, compared to 237 in 2010. The top names for 2013 were Oliver and Amelia, followed by Olivia, Emily, Ava and Isla, and Jack, Harry, Jacob and Charlie.","When the TV show began, the monikers were  dwindling into obscurity .

"Our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self-driving vehicles could bring about our demise. Professor Stephen Hawking has again warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' Scroll down for video . Professor Stephen Hawking (pictured) has again warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment.Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argues that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' But Professor Hawking noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant, with the potential to eradicate, war, disease and poverty. Professor Stephen Hawking made today's claims at an event in London, during which he unveiled a new communications platform, designed by Intel. The platform, called Assistive Context Aware Toolkit (ACAT) uses Professor Hawking's existing cheek sensor, which is detected by an infrared switch mounted onto his glasses. This helps him select a character on a computer. Software  is then used to learn from Professor Hawking and predict his next words. As a result, he types less than 20 per cent of the characters he would previously have had to type, making communication faster. This information is sent to his existing speech synthesizer so he can communicate to others. For example, to conduct a web search, Professor Hawking previously would have had to exit from his communication window, navigate a mouse to run the browser, navigate the mouse again to the search bar, and finally type the search text. This new system automates these steps. 'Looking further ahead, there are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved,' continued Professor Hawking. 'There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains.'

For example, to conduct a web search, Professor Hawking previously  had to exit from his communication window, navigate a mouse to run the browser, navigate the mouse again to the search bar and finally type the search text. This new system automates all of these steps. According to Intel, Professor Hawking's typing speed is twice as fast and his improvement in common tasks, such as easier, more accurate and faster browsing, editing, managing and navigating the web, emails and documents has increased ten-fold.

Professor Hawking has a Motor Neurone Disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - a condition that has progressed over the years. This leaves him almost entirely paralysed. 'Medicine has not been able to cure me, so I rely on technology to help me communicate and live,' said Professor Hawking. 'The development of this system has the potential to improve the lives of disabled people around the world and is leading the way in terms of human interaction and the ability to overcome communication boundaries that once stood in the way.'

Earlier this year, Elon Musk likened artificial intelligence to 'summoning the demon'. The Tesla and Space X founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons. And speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'. He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. 'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. 'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.' In August, he warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons. Tweeting a recommendation for a book by Nick Bostrom called Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies that looks at a robot uprising, he wrote: 'We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.' In a later tweet, Musk wrote: 'Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.' Mr Musk has previously claimed that a horrific 'Terminator-like' scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. In March, Mr Musk made an investment San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher. In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that 'reliably' solves modern Captchas - the world's most widely used test of a machine's ability to act human.","Professor Stephen Hawking has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment .

"An Afghanistan veteran confronted a man he believed to be a ‘fake’ solider at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday and accused him of being a phony after he watched him parade around wearing military honors that he couldn't possibly have been awarded. Ryan Berk, a Purple Heart recipient, spotted the man - who was dressed in camouflage fatigues and who identified himself as Sean Yetman - at the Oxford Valley Mall and was immediately suspicious of his mismatched uniform. Along with an American flag patch in the wrong spot, Berk noticed that Yetman was wearing three Combat Infantryman Badges (CIBs) on his shoulder – an extremely rare honor. Scroll down for video . The pudgy man in uniform, who  identified himself in the video as Sean Yetman, claimed he had 'literally just got home from Fort Lewis' and was shopping with his Sergeant Major . Using his cell phone to record their conversation, Berk approached the man and quizzed him about his experiences as a soldier. When asked where he had received his CIBs, the man first answered that he got all three in Afghanistan - an impossibility since only one is given per campaign. The conversation got more heated as Berk then called the man, who wore a name ribbon identifying himself as ‘Yetman' and who had introduced himself as 'Sean', a phony and accused him of impersonating a soldier. Yetman claimed he had 'literally just got home from Fort Lewis' and was shopping with his Sergeant Major - who he offered to introduce Berk to. When the man denied lying about his military service, Berk lost his cool. 'Here it is, stolen valor at its finest,' he shouted, as Yetman began to walk away. 'Why don’t you just admit you’re a phony?' Ryan Berk, a Afghanistan vet and Purple Heart recipient, was shopping at the mall with his girlfriend and her son when he spotted the 'fake' officer and decided to approach him . ‘I noticed his combat infantryman's badge, he had two stars above it, which would indicate that he served in three different wars which is almost physically impossible for his age,’ said Berk. There is no U.S. Army Ranger with three CIBs named Yetman listed on any official record. Speaking to Fox on Tuesday, Berk said that while the man had initially provided some answers that could have been correct, his story quickly unraveled when he claimed to have received his three CIBs from service in Afghanistan. 'I served in Afghanistan and have several friend who were seriously wounded and a couple who were killed in action who wore that same uniform and to see someone try and claim that type of sacrifice really irked me,’ said Berk. He also said his grandfather had served in World War 2 and it was ‘just wrong’ that this man was tainting that legacy by wearing the uniform. ‘No one is going to question a guy in uniform, unless they already wear the uniform,’ Berk, who earned a Purple Heart after he was wounded by shrapnel in 2010 while fighting in Afghanistan, told The Morning Call. Berk’s video of the confrontation was uploaded to the Stolen Valor YouTube account, where it has since been viewed over two million times. Speaking to Fox on Tuesday, Berk said that while the man had initially provided some answers that could have been correct, his story quickly unraveled . On Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against Sean Yetman . The account belongs to Guardian of Valor, a network of active and veteran soldiers who seek to expose people who falsely claim military service and/or claim unauthorized medals or tabs. Anthony Anderson, a vet who runs the Guardian of Valor website told Philly.com that fake soldiers are becoming increasingly common. Most are seeking attention and recognition, while others use the uniform to receive exclusive military discounts at stores and restaurants. Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’ It was unknown if the uniformed man received any special treatment from any store at the mall, but on Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against 'Yetman' Berk has no doubts that the man he confronted was not a ranger. 'He's impersonating in the uniform people died for,' Berk added. 'He was wearing awards that I earned and he didn't.'","The man, who identifies himself as Sean Yetman, was approached by Purple Heart recipient Ryan Berk who spotted him at a Pennsylvanian mall .

"For teenager Nicola Lynch the simple pleasure of enjoying dinner can leave her writhing in agony. The last time the 18-year-old indulged in a burger she had to be rushed to hospital after her jaw dislocated and was left hanging out of place. It was the latest in a 250-long list of agonising joint dislocations, Miss Lynch has suffered. She suffers a medical condition known as hypermobility syndrome, which causes her joints to pop out of place without any warning. In the last six years, since doctors diagnosed the condition, she has dislocated her shoulders 80 times. Her thumbs have popped out of place 25 times each, and her hips and ankles regularly slip out of their sockets. Nicola Lynch, 18, has dislocated her joints more than 250 times. She suffers from hypermobility syndrome, which means her joints dislocate more often than usual, leaving her in agony as most dislocations result in a traumatic injury . Hypermobility syndrome means Miss Lynch's joints have an unusually large range of movement. Some people with the joint condition have no pain, but unfortunately Miss Lynch has a severe form which means it does hurt each time she dislocates a joint. She is pictured showing her stretchy joints (left and right) Miss Lynch (right) is unable to work due to her condition, and struggles with every day tasks like brushing her hair and the ironing. Her fiance Stephan Filmer, 22, (left) assists her, although he has to be careful as he has accidentally injured her in the past when they were 'mucking around' Every time she dislocates a joint, Miss Lynch is left in agony because unlike in double-jointed people, her condition causes traumatic injuries. She is left unable to work due to her condition, and said she lives in fear, constantly worrying about which part of her body will dislocate next. She said: 'I first dislocated my thumb when I was about 12. I was mucking about with a friend, and I grabbed her coat and it just popped out of place. The pain was horrendous. 'The doctors put it in a cast and sent me home, but a couple of days later, I dislocated my other thumb, and that was put in a cast too. 'It started off just in my hands, but then my shoulders started going, and now it's moved on to my hips, ankles and jaw. It's terrible - I feel like a human jigsaw.' The fragile teenager was diagnosed with hypermobility syndrome, which means although she has an unusually large range of movement, her joints dislocate themselves regularly. Hypermobility syndrome is thought to be caused by lack of collagen in skin and tissues, which leaves tissue fragile and joints particularly loose and stretchy. Miss Lynch's latest dislocation was just two weeks ago when her ankle gave way and she fell, dislocating that and also her shoulder. In the past she has dislocated her hips about 50 times, and now her ankles pop out of their socket around three times a week. Joint hypermobility means some or all of a person's joints have an unusually large range of movement. People with hypermobility are particularly supple and able to move their limbs into positions others find impossible. Many people with hypermobile joints do not have any problems or need treatment. However, joint hypermobility can sometimes cause unpleasant symptoms, such as: . It can cause extreme tiredness and long-term pain. The condition is often hereditary, and is linked to changes in a protein called collagen. Collagen is found throughout the body – for example, in skin and ligaments. If collagen is weaker than it should be, tissues in the body will be fragile. This can make ligaments and joints particularly loose and stretchy. There are estimates that up to three in 10 people may be affected to some degree. Source: NHS Choices . Miss Lynch, who is unable to work as a result of her condition, lives with her retired nurse mum Rosemary Walker, 51, and postman stepfather Martin Walker, 51, in Rainham, Kent. She tries to not let her condition get in the way of her life - despite being hospitalised the last time she ate a burger. She said: 'I was in a restaurant with my fiance and family when I ordered a burger. 'It was quite big, and when I opened my mouth to take a bite my jaw just clicked out of place. 'I had to go to the hospital because it was just hanging loose and absolutely killing. 'Since then my jaw has popped out twice more, so I've got be really careful not to eat anything too chewy or hard. It's tough, but my fiance and family are really supportive.' She met her fiance Stephan Filmer through friends and started dating about 15 months ago. Mr Filmer, a greenkeeper, got down on one knee on their one-year anniversary. Miss Lynch said: 'I wasn't expecting it at all, but it was wonderful. 'I can't really get down on one knee in case something pops out, but he did and it was lovely. 'He's so supportive of me and really understands that there are certain things I can't do because of my condition.' But he also has to be careful around her because her fragile joints mean he's accidentally caused several dislocations while 'mucking around'. Miss Lynch said: 'The look on his face whenever it's happened is terrifying. Of course he never means to hurt me, but sometimes it happens anyway. 'I try to put on a brave face and not let on how much pain I'm in, but it's tough. 'I've met a couple of other people with hypermobility syndrome, and it's good to know that they go through the same things as me. 'I know my joints are sadly getting worse, so I'm probably going to have to have quite a few replacement operations soon. 'I'm living in fear of what will dislocate next, really.' Each time she dislocates her joint, which often happens carrying out basic tasks, she suffers a traumatic injury. She is pictured (left) struggling to pick up a bag, and with her arm in a sling (right) after a dislocation . Some people with hypermobility are able to stretch much further than normal. But the syndrome form of the condition, which Miss Lynch suffers, is more severe as it causes pain. Miss Lynch has already had operations on tendons and ligaments in her hands, but she still dislocates them from time to time. She said: 'I was told it would get easier as I got older, but it just seems to have gotten worse. 'It happens to my jaw now. My ankles also give way and I just fall over. I've fallen down the stairs before. 'I was at college once and fainted. When I came round, my hip and both shoulders were dislocated. I couldn't do anything. An air ambulance had to take me to hospital. 'It's constantly happening and it's affected my life in every way. 'I can't lift anything heavy, even shopping bags. I can't walk far, either, and have to be careful walking up the stairs. 'I haven't been able to hold down a job and relationships have always been tricky. 'Thankfully Stephan is very supportive and caring - even if we have to be careful when we're together.'

"The promoter who organised the farcical Mickey Rourke boxing bout in Moscow has admitted it was simply a public relations stunt in which the star chose his own opponent. The 'fight', which has been ridiculed around the world, saw the 62-year-old beat Sin City star beat Elliot Seymour, a 29-year-old homeless boxer from Los Angeles. But while he confessed that he was not expecting a 'super outstanding match', the man behind the bout Andrei Ryabinsky, denied that Seymour had thrown the fight. Scroll down for video . PR stunt: Andrey Ryabinsky, whose promotion company World of Boxing promoted the bout between 62-year-old Rourke and 29-year-old Elliot Seymour, said the fight was simply 'a show' Elliot Seymour, 29, entered the fight with Mickey Rourke, 62, with a shocking professional record of losing 9-1 of his 10 previous bouts. He lost the fight (pictured above) in the second round . After defeating Seymour in the second round of Friday's fight Rourke (left, during the match and, right, after) celebrated by carrying his trainer Marvin Somodio on his shoulders and parading him around the ring . He said: 'Maybe earlier somebody thought this would be a match for the ratings? Of course, it was a show, this is obvious. What's the problem? 'I expected to see Rourke and a show which people would like,' he said. 'But the main story was about Rourke. It is good for us, the more noise around this event the better. He added: 'It is a sort of PR for us, and you know, there is no bad PR except an obituary. So Mickey Rourke worked 100 per cent.' Ryabinsky, who runs a promotion outfit called World of Boxing added that he did 'not admit any guilt,' adding that he thought the fight had done well. 'People gathered to watch Mickey Rourke and his boxing match,' he said. 'And now they are saying it was a show, we unmasked you. Seymour (pictured right and left), is a drifter who trained at the same Hollywood gym and Rourke and was paid to fly to Russia to make the actor 'look good’ - a claim the boxer has denied . Rourke's manager Vadim Kornilov said he had sparred with the 62-year-old Sin City star before the fight and that he was in 'great shape. He also helped to pick his client's opponent . Like Elliot Seymour himself, Ryabinsky also denied the homeless pugilist had been paid to fall over in the second round of the match. He said: 'It was not 'fixed' at all, it was a fair match. An opponent for Rourke was chosen according to his condition, age and skills, so he could compete and had a chance to win. But it was not 'fixed'.' But he admitted that Rourke and his aides chose Seymour, who they knew from his sports club in America. 'Mickey Rourke is my friend, he asked me if we could put his match as a part of our programme that night,' said Ryabinsky who did not reveal how much money the fighters were paid for the bout. He added that Rourke and his Russian agent Vadim Kornilov, 'chose the opponent together.' 'Visit the website Boxrec.com where boxer profiles can be found, and Mickey Rourke's rival is presented there,' he continued. 'He is a professional boxer. Yes, he is not a good boxer, but this is a secondary question.' 'If an ordinary man from the street meets him at the boxing ring, he will be punished. In other words, this guy is a weak boxer but he is a boxer.' Pointing to Seymour's physique he insisted that the struggling fighter was a 'serious muscleman' and despite clear evidence to the contrary he said: 'He does not look like a homeless man at all.' 'It is clear that the boxers are not the richest guys in this world, except the stars, of course. But it is not important in this case,' he said. 'It is important that he is a professional boxer. The matter of his financial wealth is not interesting for us. Pictured with Russian boxing champion Ruslan Provodnikov, Vadim Kornilov who also manages Mickey Rourke, has also denied the bout was fixed . 'Besides, before the match he passed a medical commission and he was officially allowed to box that night. So there is nothing to talk about here, we have done all this at a good quality level.' Vadim Kornilov, variously described as Rourke's manager in Russia and a co-organiser of the fight, was also quick to defend the choice of Seymour as an opponent. 'He is not the richest nor the most pathetic sportsman,' he said. 'Maybe he can be called poor, as many sportsmen of his age are. Maybe from time to time he earns some money as a sparring partner.' He added that having trained and sparred with Rourke he could say with confidence that the film star was in 'perfect shape.' Rourke (left) and Elliot Seymour (right) before the fight in Russia on Friday . Alejandro Puelma, 29, the manager at the Starbucks that Seymour bases himself in (pictured above), confirmed the boxer was currently homeless, adding he was well liked by staff and customers . Another source close to the fight added that having considered Mickey's age, an opponent was chosen of a certain weight, talent and skills. But they insisted, 'It is not correct to say that we bought a homeless 'punch bag' for Mickey. For his part, Seymour has also denied throwing the fight and has instead claimed that he did not have long enough to prepare for the ring. 'The fight wasn't thrown,' he said in an earlier interview. 'I only had one month to train.' When asked how much money he was paid for the fight, the 29-year-old California drifter pointed to a photo of $100 bills fanned out on a bed that has been posted on his Facebook page. Seymour, pictured aged 23 after winning his Golden Gloves amateur title, admired boxer Muhammed Ali as he was growing up . From the picture it appears that Seymour earned just over $3,000 for facing Rourke in the ring. But his claims were contradicted by a source close to his family who told Mail Online Sunday that the cash-strapped vagrant was paid to fly to Moscow to make Rourke 'look good.' 'It was clearly a fixed fight,' they said. 'The whole bouncing off the ropes, hands down, punches were not landing and they were intentionally hitting each other’s gloves. 'There are people at Wild Card gym who know that Elliot’s in a really terrible situation and pretty much living on the streets, these are Mickey Rourke’s people who Elliot’s been around and known for some time.' Revealing the sad back story of the fighter, the family source said he had been on the streets since May 2013. 'He’s pretty much hanging out at Starbucks, very disheveled, people have taken him clothes because he just smelled horrible, he hadn’t bathed and hadn’t changed clothes for several days,' they said. 'He doesn’t have a place to live consistently if he’s doing anything he’s couch surfing. 'He spends nights in the local park. I know he crashed with friends sometimes, but he’s pretty much burned bridges with his friends.'

"Two children sit outside a hospital in Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone, digging into a bowl of food and sharing plastic bags of clean water. They have both been orphaned during the Ebola outbreak that has gripped West Africa and put the rest of the planet in a state of constant vigilance and fear. The death toll in the outbreak is now at 4,546, around half of the  known cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the latest figures from the UN World Health Organization. Tragedy: Two young orphans whose parents have died of Ebola sharing a meal in Kenema,  Sierra Leone . Now, the WHO is scaling up efforts to reach 600,000 people that have been affected by the health crisis in the area, that has seen hundreds of children orphaned and many families left without a breadwinner. The latest death toll was released as the news came that Nigeria has been declared free from Ebola after passing the six week mark with no new cases. 'This is a spectacular success story,' Rui Gama Vaz from the WHO told a news conference in the capital Abuja, where officials broke into applause when he announced that Nigeria had shaken off the disease. 'It shows that Ebola can be contained, but we must be clear that we have only won a battle, the war will only end when West Africa is also declared free of Ebola.' This year's outbreak of the highly infectious haemorrhagic fever thought to have originated in forest bats is the worst on record. Left behind: Children from Sierra Leone, where hundreds have died from Ebola, sitting in front of the hospital . Aftermath: Sierra Leone health workers bury an Ebola victim near Kenema Hospital in Sierra Leone as  Nigeria has been declared  Ebola free after six weeks of no new cases . Victim: Ebola has claimed the lives of over 4,500 people across West Africa with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia the worst affected . It was imported to Nigeria when Liberian-American diplomat Patrick Sawyer collapsed at the main international airport in Lagos on July 20. Airport staff were unprepared and the government had not set up any hospital isolation unit, so he was able to infect several people, including health workers in the hospital where he was taken, some of whom had to restrain him to keep him there. Lagos, the commercial hub of Africa's most populous nation, largest economy and leading energy producer, would have been an ideal springboard for Ebola to spread across the country. 'Nigeria was not really prepared for the outbreak, but the swift response from the federal government, state governments (and) international organisations was essential,' said Samuel Matoka, Ebola operations manager in Nigeria for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). 'If a country like Nigeria, hampered by serious security problems, can do this ... any country in the world experiencing an imported case can hold onward transmission to just a handful of cases,' WHO Director Margaret Chan said in a statement. For the three impoverished countries at the epicentre of the crisis, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, it is a different matter. According to consultancy DaMina Advisors, Nigeria has one doctor per 2,879 people compared with one per 86,275 in Liberia. Gripping a nation: Bystanders look at a health worker in protective clothing after he and his colleagues removed the body of a woman suspected of having died after contracting the Ebola virus in Liberia . Health workers carry the woman's body to a nearby burial site in Bomi county, on the outskirts of Monrovia . Yesterday, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said Ebola has killed more than 2,000 people in her country and has brought it to 'a standstill', noting that Liberia and two other badly hit countries were already weakened by years of war. Appealing for more international help, Sirleaf described the devastating effects of Ebola in a 'Letter to the World' that was broadcast Sunday by the BBC. 'Across West Africa, a generation of young people risk being lost to an economic catastrophe as harvests are missed, markets are shut and borders are closed,' the Nobel Peace Prize laureate said. 'The virus has been able to spread so rapidly because of the insufficient strength of the emergency, medical and military services that remain under-resourced.' 'There is no coincidence Ebola has taken hold in three fragile states - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - all battling to overcome the effects of interconnected wars,' she said adding that Liberia once had 3,000 medical doctors but by the end of its civil war in 2003, the country had just 36.","Hundreds of children have been orphaned when parents died from Ebola .

"She has sold more than 70 million records, has a reported net worth of £47m and is one of the world's most adored celebrities - but life wasn't always so easy for Kylie Minogue. The pop star has revealed that times were once so tough, she even had to make her own clothes out of fabric she snapped up at the local market.

I didn't know I would end up living here and working with these designers so celebrating tonight means a lot to me, an awful lot. 'Fashion has never waned, you want to work with people who are at the top of their game but there's always designers coming up who have something to offer and I love to be connected to that as much as possible and support them.'

"While Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham hobnobbed with Anna Wintour and Sir Philip Green at the London Coliseum last night, in Battersea, a very different awards ceremony was taking place. As the winners of the annual British Curry Awards were announced, a small band of hardy celebrities, among them Lizzie Cundy and Nancy Dell'Olio, were in the audience. And they had certainly dressed up for the occasion, with Dell'Olio, 53, opting for a dramatic Grecian-style column dress, while Cundy, 46, plumped for a frock that shimmered with sequins. Scroll down for video . Sequins at the ready! Lizzie Cundy (left) and Nancy Dell'Olio (right) pulled out all the stops for the event . Mwah! Nancy Dell'Olio trades kisses with Loose Women panellist Shobna Gulati . Also on the guest list was Keith Vaz MP, who, unlike the female attendees, chose to forgo sequins in favour of a neatly tailored suit. But not everyone was so restrained. Folami Ankoanda-Thompson, a singer with 1970s band Chic, opted for a glittering number that could have come straight from a theatrical costume department. Just as colourful was Home Secretary Theresa May, who joined the party in a turquoise shalwar kameez and a bright red pair of flat pumps. The British Curry Awards have become something of an institution since being launched by businessman Enam Ali in 2005. Dubbed Britain's 'Curry Oscars', they recognise the efforts of chefs and businessmen alike and recognise restaurateurs who have made a real difference to the UK's gastronomic scene. Support: Also at the event were Keith Vaz MP (left), Frankie Poultney and David Seaman (right) Powerful backing: Home Secretary Theresa May MP also turned out to show her support . Looking good: Mrs May opted for a colourful shalwar kameez and a pair of bright red pumps . Politicians, among them the Prime Minister and Boris Johnson, regularly attend the event, and the Queen sends a yearly message congratulating the winners on their culinary efforts. This year's victors include Dartford's Polash Tandoori, which won the Best Takeaway award, and Mohammed Aslam MBE, who was handed the Special Recognition gong. Speaking during the awards ceremony, founder Enam Ali said: 'Curry may have been born in India but now British curry has truly a place in the hearts and stomachs of people throughout the land. 'It started in the early 60s with curry and chips. In those days it was the chips that broke down the barriers and Vindaloo or Tindaloo proved the masculinity of ‘real men’ before they washed it down with a few pints of lager. 'When we started the British Curry Awards in 2005 we were criticised for calling curry ""British"". 'I am happy to take the blame for the changes in perception that have taken place since then because today British curry dishes such as Tikka Masala have an identity all of their own and are known and admired throughout the world.'

"Darren Wilson changed his story following the immediate aftermath of the fatal shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown to include events about which he initially denied all knowledge. Evidence presented to the grand jury and reviewed by MailOnline has revealed a crucial difference between the officer's first account of events given to his squad supervisor on the scene and his second statement to St Louis County detectives investigating the shooting. In Wilson's now very public account of his encounter with Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson on August 9 he has claimed that he asked Brown and Wilson to move to the sidewalk rather than walk in the street. When they walked on, Wilson has repeatedly stated, he realized they matched the description of two suspects wanted in connection with the robbery of nearby Ferguson Market. A youth matching Brown's description had stolen a box of Swishers cigarillos. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: Darren Wilson was photographed shortly after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, in August, at his local police union facility . Police chief: Thomas Jackson was among the senior officers who spent time with Wilson after he shot Michael Brown and before St Louis detectives arrived to take over the case . It was this realization, he stated, that caused him to reverse his vehicle and sparked the car-side confrontation that left Brown dead on the street with six bullets in his body. But the sworn testimony of Wilson's squad supervisor directly contradicts this account. Wilson's supervisor was the first officer to speak with the 28-year-old cop following the shooting. The men spoke before St Louis County Police had even been notified of the incident and before the medical examiner or investigating officers had arrived on the scene. At that time, the supervisor said:'He [Wilson] did not know anything about the stealing call.' When pressed by the attorney questioning him, the officer reiterated that Wilson, 'did not know anything'. Asked, 'He told you he didn't know about there being a stealing at Ferguson Market?' The officer responded, 'Correct.' Nor did he make any mention of reversing his police car back towards the youths. In fact the squad supervisor stated that, in several subsequent conversations, Wilson said 'he did not have that call.' Yet two hours after speaking to his supervisor, 28-year-old Wilson gave a very different account to the St Louis County Police detective assigned to conduct a cursory interview with the cop. In his testimony the St Louis detective, whose name has been redacted in the transcripts that are among the thousands of pages of grand jury evidence made publicly available by Prosecutor Bob McCulloch, recalled: 'He tells me he was leaving an unrelated sick case call and was driving, it would be west on Canfield Road. 'As he's driving he hears a call that was not assigned to him for a stealing in progress at 9101 West Florissant Avenue and he provides us with that address and the nature of the call was a stealing. 'He said that the call comments indicated the suspect description was a black male wearing a black shirt and brown shorts, and that an additional call comment indicated that taken during the stealing were Cigarillos.' It is a marked discrepancy from Wilson's admission minutes after the shooting that he had no knowledge of that incident. In the time between that denial and this detailed recollection of the suspect's description and goods stolen, Wilson had driven himself back to Ferguson Police Department Headquarters on the city's Main Street. He had washed his hands clean of any blood and he had been permitted to bag up his own gun as evidence - acts entirely contrary to St Louis County procedure. And in the course of an hour, he had spent time in the company of the Lieutenant Colonel, his Chief of Police Thomas Jackson, as well as an attorney from the Fraternity of Police Officers. Looters robbed Ferguson businesses and set fire to property in the wake of the grand jury decision not to convict Darren Wilson, which many have criticized as a step in the wrong direction for the town where tensions between citizens and police have long been an issue . Latest protests: Student activists at Washington University in St Louis yesterday as a nationwide debate about race and policing continues to boil . Wilson was sitting with all three when the St Louis County detective arrived to interview him. Before he could, Wilson's Lieutenant Colonel made the decision to take the officer to hospital for treatment. Medical records show that what Wilson described as a struggle for his life left scant physical injury. Wilson was diagnosed with bruising and given medication described by his treating physician as 'essentially prescription strength Aleve.' It is now also known that the decision to X-ray Wilson was not a clinical one made by his medic but in response to the Chief of Police's direct request. What he told his squad supervisor . 'He [Wilson] did not know anything about the stealing call.' What he told St Louis detective . 'As he's driving he hears a call that was not assigned to him for a stealing in progress at 9101 West Florissant Avenue and he provides us with that address and the nature of the call was a stealing.' What he told the FBI . 'He heard over the radio a call for a stealing in progress…He heard it was at a market, he didn't hear which one and he heard a description over the radio saying the subjects were walking towards the QuikTrip, stole Cigarillos and one subject was wearing a black shirt' What he told grand jury . 'When I start looking at Brown, first thing I notice is his right hand, his right hand is full of Cigarillos. And that's when it clicker for me because I now saw the Cigarillos, I looked in my mirror, I did a double check that Johnson was wearing a black shirt, these are the two from the stealing.' It was Chief Thomas who released CCTV footage of the Ferguson Market robbery showing Brown swiping the cigarillos and squaring up to a clearly intimidated store keeper. His actions drew harsh criticism from those who saw it as an attempt to smear Brown and shift focus from Wilson. Chief Thomas's claim that he released the tapes in response to media requests was subsequently shown to be untrue. In his interview with the St Louis County detective Wilson recalled Brown handing something to Dorian Johnson and saying something like, 'Here take these.' But he said he could not see what was handed. By the time officer Wilson gave his account to the FBI agent assigned to interview him on 28 August his power of recall had grown ever more impressive. The Federal agent told the Grand Jury that Wilson stated, 'He heard over the radio a call for a stealing in progress…He heard it was at a market, he didn't hear which one and he heard a description over the radio saying the subjects were walking towards the QuikTrip, stole Cigarillos and one subject was wearing a black shirt. 'Officer Wilson's attention was then drawn to Michael Brown and he noticed that Michael Brown's hands were full of Cigarillos. He looks in his rear view mirror and also saw that Dorian was wearing a black T-shirt.' Crucially, the FBI agent continued, 'Thinking back on the call, Michael Brown was wearing a gray t-shirt and the call was they stole Cigarillos and one was wearing a black shirt. 'So kind of putting tow and two together or thinking that these might be the two guys, he puts the car in to reverse.' Wilson got out of the car to give chase following the struggle for his gun that saw the first shot fired, because, the agent stated, 'Michael Brown was a fleeing felon. And he was just doing his job, those were his words.' None of the interviews - not the first account given to his Squad Supervisor, or the cursory interview conducted within hours of the shooting by the St Louis detective or the FBI's own interrogation - were recorded. Asked why he had not recorded nor noted down Wilson's vital first account, his squad supervisor said, 'Number one, I did not have a recorder. Number two, I didn't take notes because at that point in time I had multiple things going through my mind besides what Darren was telling me.' Wilson who resigned without severance this week has never filled out an incident report, nor has he written a 'use of force' report or been asked to provide a formal statement to anyone other than his attorney.","Wilson told the first officer to question him on the death that he did not know about a radio call about two teenagers being wanted for robbery .
But he later told St Louis detectives that he had matched Michael Brown to the description of wanted suspects .
He also did not initially reveal that he backed up his car towards Michael Brown and his friend, which he said subsequently .

"When police officers in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes, and stopped them before they happened, it was considered so futuristic the film was set in 2054. But, police in Berlin are considering adopting a similar software that predicts crimes and is named ‘Precobs’ - in a nod to the sci-fi film. Other forces, including police officers in two American states and London’s Metropolitan Police  are also trialling predictive systems to catch would-be criminals. When police officers in the Minority Report (pictured) predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they happened, it was considered so futuristic the film was set in 2054. But, police in Berlin are considering adopting similar software that predicts crimes, and is named ‘Precobs’ in a nod to the sci-fi film . Developed by a German firm, the software program predicts when and where a crime is most likely to occur, based on different sets of data. It is being tested by police in the southern state of Bavaria. ‘The Berlin police is first waiting for the results of the trial run in Bavaria’ before deciding on on whether to acquire Precobs, a spokesman said. The name is a contraction of ‘Pre-Crime Observation System’. The ‘Precobs’ title borrows deliberately from the ‘precog’ term used in Minority Report referring to three psychics who predict crimes before they happen. Developed by a German firm, the software program predicts when and where a crime is most likely to occur, based on different sets of data. It is being tested by police in the southern state of Bavaria. A stock image of a German police officer wearing protective clothing is pictured . Last year, law enforcers in two American states used crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervised them accordingly. Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system used a computer algorithm to decide for them. The Minority Report-style software is already being used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict future murderers. It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes. Professor Berk says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future. It could also be modified to predict lesser crimes. The 2002 movie starring Tom Cruise and directed by Steven Spielberg was based on a story by Philip K Dick. The German Precobs system relies on data of the location, time and other details of past crimes, such as home break-ins. When a new incident is reported, the software analyses the data to look for a pattern that will point to a future target. It was developed by the Institute for pattern-based Prediction Technique in Oberhausen. The initial results from tests on burglaries in the Bavarian cities of Munich and Nuremberg are ‘promising’, the state's interior minister Joachim Herrmann said in a progress report last month. But a civil rights activist voiced concern in Tuesday's Berliner Zeitung that personal data could eventually be used, instead of the currently anonymous information. Two months ago, London's Metropolitan Police announced it has tested a system that analyses a person's criminal history, and posts on social media, to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime. The 20-week pilot study, which is the first of its kind in the UK, combined data from different crime reporting and crime intelligence systems used by the Met to pinpoint gang members who are more likely to commit violent crimes. Developed by global consulting group, Accenture, the latest software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across London's 32 boroughs across a four year period. Police then compared the software's results to known acts of violence that took place in the fifth year to test its accuracy, but they are keeping quiet about the results. In Singapore, authorities are undertaking a Safe City initiative that combines electronic vision technologies and predictive analytics into CCTV video feeds to detect street incidents. Other forces, including police officers in two American states and London’s Metropolitan Police are also trialling predictive systems to catch criminals.

"The stepmother of an Oregon boy whose 2010 disappearance sparked an intense and widespread search is again trying to persuade a judge to let her change her name. Terri Moulton Horman made a similar request in August, saying she wanted to start a new life and avoid the stigma attached to the disappearance of Kyron Horman. The seven-year-old went missing in June 2010 after she dropped him off at his Portland school. Scroll down for video . Terri Horman wants to change her name to Claire Kisiel after her step-son, Kyron Horman, vanished from his Portland school four years ago. Kyron is seen here with his biological mom, Desiree Young . A major search came up empty. Investigators have focused on Horman, but she has never been charged. Kyron Horman’s biological parents and others have said they suspect Moulton Horman of being involved in the disappearance of her  stepson. She asked a Lane County judge last week to change her name to Claire Kisiel. The Register-Guard reports the request will be considered December 11. In August she tried to change her name to Claire Stella Sullivan, saying it would allow her to start life over, the Roseburg News-Review reported at the time. The child’s father, Kaine Horman, filed for divorce from Moulton Horman a few weeks after Kyron went missing. 'After being divorced for six months, I decided I wanted to start my new life under a new name,' she said. Four people involved in search efforts for the boy and fundraisers objected in court, saying Terri Horman hadn't answered questions about him. 'Kyron doesn't have a voice...

"New book 'substantially contradicts' Truman Capote's In Cold Blood . Files from the investigation into the murders that inspired Truman Capote's In Cold Blood are set to be published in a book which 'substantially contradicts' Capote's version . Ronald Nye's father, a Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent, kept detailed notes and photographs from the investigation into the 1959 killings that inspired Capote's bestselling book. In 2012, the Kansas attorney general's office sued Nye to block him from publishing his father's files, but this has now been lifted. In a ruling made public Monday, Shawnee County District Court Judge Larry Hendricks said he made an error when he initially blocked publication of the criminal investigation files in 2012. Mr Nye, of Oklahoma City, is the son of Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Harold Nye, who features in Truman Capote's non-fiction novel In Cold Blood from 1966. The book follows the investigation into the 1959 murders of prominent farmer and community leader Herbert Clutter, his wife Bonnie, and their tow youngest children, Kenyon, 15, and 16-year-old Nancy,  at their rural farmhouse in Holcomb, Kansas. The hunt for their killers mesmerized the nation, drawing journalists from across the United States . to the small, western Kansas town, including Capote and his life-long friend Harper Lee. Parolees Richard 'Dick' Hickock, 33, and Perry Smith, 36, were found guilty of the murders, and executed by hanging in 1965. Capote's book about the crime has been a bestseller for decades, and inspired a movie of the same name. Mr Nye says  his father Harold was so disappointed in Capote's book that he read only about 115 pages before throwing it across the room. He said his father walked out of the movie's premiere after just 15 minutes. Murdered: Prominent farmer and community leader Herbert Clutter, his wife Bonnie, and their two youngest children, Kenyon, 15, and 16-year-old Nancy, were murdered at their rural farmhouse in Holcomb, Kansas . Killers: Richard Hickock, left, and Perry Smith, were both convicted and hanged for the 1959 murders of Herb and Bonnie Clutter and their children in Holcomb, Kansas . On Monday, Judge Hendricks ruled Mr Nye's First Amendment right to publish the material outweigh the government's interest in maintaining the confidentiality of its investigative records. Mr Nye and co-author Gary McAvoy would not reveal exactly what is in the files, but Mr Nye said his father's notebooks had 'vast discrepancies' from what Capote wrote. 'Our belief is that there is no other reason (Kansas) would want the materials we have suppressed were it not for the information we found in them,' McAvoy said. 'That information connects to other research I've done and supports a pretty compelling new theory — one that I am reluctant to even discuss at this point.' The state's lawsuit also asked the court to decide legal ownership of the case files. The judge has made no ruling on that issue. Murder scene: The former home of the Clutter family is seen in Holcomb, Kansas in 2009 . Never forget: A grain truck passes by a park dedicated to the Herbert Clutter family in Holcomb . The judge wrote that Kansas had not shown a legal justification for suppressing the material or for interfering with the public's right to know what is in them. He also rejected the state's argument that the Clutter family's privacy concerns justified blocking their release. 'The court is sensitive to the plaintiff's concern about publicity and its effect on the Clutters,' Hendricks wrote. 'However, publicity continues to follow this case even fifty-five years after its occurrence.' O. Yale Lewis, Jr., an attorney for Nye and McAvoy, said his clients hope to have their book published in time for the 50th anniversary in September of the publication of Capote's book.","Son of officer who worked on In Cold Blood murders set to publish book .

"Barely five-years-old and armed with a hand gun, a blonde-haired toddler runs through the streets in Syria. Dodging pretend enemy fire as he moves from post to post, he could be playing an innocent game of cops and robbers. But the white-skinned boy is not playing games - he is being trained by Islamic Militants to fight. Indoctrination: A boy, thought to be around five, is being 'trained' by ISIS as he plays with a pellet gun . Dressed in jogging bottoms, pumps and a jumper, at one point the boy pauses to load his weapon. The chilling footage was shared online by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, an activist group which documents the shocking violence and oppression imposed by jihadists. Charlie Winter, a spokesman for the Quilliam Foundation Think Tank, said: ‘This video is yet more evidence of Islamic State seeking to indoctrinate children from a very young age in an attempt to entrench its hold over the region. ‘Such footage is worrying, in particular because it renders apparent the fact that IS’ legacy will be long-term, even if it was to collapse tomorrow.’ The video, titled ISIS training children to fight in Raqqa, opens with the line: ‘That which God wills, there is no power but with Allah.’ In training: The fair-haired boy laughs as he runs through the streets of Raqqa, dodging pretend enemies . Soldier to be: The boy with the gun runs from corner to corner across the street and ducks for cover while pretending to engage in fire with the enemy in the Islamic State stronghold . Get them young: ISIS are now allegedly focusing on children, in order to create a generation of fighters whose idea of extremism and acts of terrorism come second nature . It shows another boy of a similar age wearing an orange jumper and looking into the camera, while what is believed to be IS militants stand by and watch. The boy with the gun runs from corner to corner across the street and ducks for cover while pretending to engage in fire with the enemy in the Islamic State stronghold. He is not holding a real firearm, but a pellet gun, and had the video not been set in the middle of ISIS territory, it would have been easy to dismiss it as young boys playing a game of soldier. Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently operates from inside the city, viewed by many as the 'capital' of ISIS, with a smaller number of activists outside its borders who communicate with the outside world. Risking their lives, the group use their mobile phones to film and take photographs of crimes committed by ISIS in Raqqa. Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi, a 22-year-old former medical student who fought against Syrian leader Al-Assad, has been  forced to flee Raqqa after documenting an ISIS crucifixion. 'We were activists against the Assad regime when we started, but after our city was freed, and ISIS took over our freedom, we just decided to launch this campaign to expose all the crimes that ISIS do,' he told VICE News. The chilling footage was shared online by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, an activist group which documents the shocking violence and oppression imposed by jihadists . 'Most of the people of Raqqa are against ISIS, maybe 90 percent. The other 10, ISIS gives them money, power, and because of that they want it in the city.' It also emerged extremists have set up a school in Syria called Osama Bin Laden. The religious school, named after the former leader of Al Qaeda, was opened in Manbij, a small town in the north. The facility offers religious instruction classes for residents living in the town and classes in Islamic State’s extremist version of Sharia law. Last week photographs emerged showing young Syrian children being trained at a military camp run by terrorists. The images, understood to have been taken at a school near the capital of Raqqa, show children being taught basic combat and survival skills, learning how to use rifles and being given lessons in extremist ideology. They were shared online by the same activist group, which said the Al-Sharea school was specifically run to provide militant training to young males under the age of 16. Its objective was said to be to distort the views of children from an early age to create a generation of fighters whose idea of extremism and acts of terrorism come second nature.","Video shows young boy running in Syrian street with a pellet gun .

"THE MADWOMAN IN THE VOLVO: MY YEAR OF RAGING HORMONES by Sandra Tsing Loh (Norton £16.99) My heart is broken, my world is dead, my home destroyed. I’m staring into the void.’ Sandra Tsing Loh, 49 years old, is in a state of near-despair: anxious, newly-divorced, putting on weight and stumbling through the ruins of a love affair she’d hoped would be her salvation. She is sobbing uncontrollably in her car about the death of her children’s hamster. She is sad, disappointed and confused. She is also, she soon discovers, in the early stages of the menopause. Loh’s midlife malaise manifests itself with bloating, weight gain and uncontrollable moods, until a diagnosis of menopause galvanises her into finding ways to navigate ‘the change’. Scroll down for video . Sandra Loh’s midlife malaise manifested itself with bloating, weight gain and uncontrollable moods, until a diagnosis of menopause galvanises her into finding ways to navigate ‘the change’ Her voyage of self-discovery is at the heart of this frank and funny memoir: she is encouraged that women such as Madonna and Oprah have helped remove the stigma associated with middle-age, and demonstrated that it can be a time of female empowerment. In non-European cultures, menopause is often regarded positively: in India, for example, it is seen as a time of growth, opening the door to enlightenment and wisdom. On this side of the world, meanwhile, the menopause is seen as profoundly unglamorous: three parts desiccation, one part fury, when a woman’s face becomes a tangle of wrinkles and lost gravity. Loh laments ‘the appearance of morning chin hairs that, by noon, are long enough to braid and twirl up into thick Princess Leia buns’. Her solution? Self-help books, wacky, new exercise regimes, a personal trainer, fanatical dieting (‘I have counted the carbs in ketchup’) and a haircut. She and her lover manage to patch things up, at first ecstatically reunited, later irritating each other to the point where he temporarily moves out. The ups and downs of their relationship provide a metaphor for what is happening inside Loh’s head and body. This candid account of Loh’s darkest hour will strike a chord with more women than would ever admit it (stock picture) After one of her two daughters — 11-year-old Hannah — is teased on Facebook, for example, Loh prepares to exact ruthless revenge on the schoolboy culprit, stationing herself outside his classroom, ready to do violence. In the book’s most moving section, Loh charts her devastating feelings as she loses her enthusiasm for being a mother. In a terrible admission, she writes that she feels she no longer loves her daughters, that she has nothing left to offer, as she sinks into an emotional paralysis. ‘I feel they will immediately read from my dull eyes what I can no longer hide: that I don’t love them, never will again. That’s the horrible secret at the core of this, the devil’s sibilant whisper.’ Happily, her two daughters rise to the occasion, making cards and a sumptuous breakfast, proffering hugs and understanding, until, slowly, Loh emerges back into the warm, familiar joy of motherhood. This candid account of Loh’s darkest hour will strike a chord with more women than would ever admit it. She can be hilarious, such as with her conclusion that no single husband can ever really suffice: ‘Your first husband is the provider; your second husband is the one who talks to you; my third husband will be a cat. If I am lucky.’ Everything changes when she consults a doctor who prescribes hormone replacement therapy. A dab of topical oestrogen cream on her wrists and, suddenly, her world changes. Two key truths emerge from this book. The first is that women today live longer and have their children later. ‘They have adjusted the timetable for childbearing, so that menopause and teaching a teenager how to drive a car will occur in the same week.’ The second is that the menopause is traditionally seen as a disease of deficiency — rather than a wholly natural event. But Loh suggests that, when women are no longer buoyed by oestrogen — the hormone that makes them ‘want to help people and serve people and cut up their sandwiches into ever-tinier squares’ — they are free to play a wider role in the world.","Sandra, 49, suffered bloating, weight gain and uncontrollable moods .

"This is the moment David Cameron was shoved by a jogger who sprinted past bodyguards, sparking a major security alert. Fitness fanatic Dean Farley, 28, charged into the Prime Minister outside Leeds Civic Hall yesterday. The incident – captured on a bystander’s mobile phone – led to a police protection row as experts accused officers of allowing a ‘very significant security breach’. Collision: After running across the road, Fitness fanatic Dean Farley, 28, crashes into David Cameron outside Leeds Civic Hall on Monday - despite the last-minute intervention of a security officer, left . Chaos: Farley, circled left, is grabbed by protection officers as the Prime Minister, circled right, is left ‘vulnerable’ standing alone for a number of seconds before being driven away in a waiting car . Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan Howe has ordered an investigation as MPs and security experts pointed out that Mr Cameron could have been stabbed or killed. Although he was uninjured, police faced withering criticism. The footage showed officers pouncing on Mr Farley, and wrestling him to the ground, while Mr Cameron was left ‘vulnerable’ standing alone for a number of seconds before being driven away. Tory MP Mark Pritchard called for a full inquiry. ‘Met Police close protection officers are some of the best in the world, but what if the protester had been carrying a knife?’ he said. Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection, said police had serious questions to answer about their failures to protect Mr Cameron yesterday. Cuffed: Farley is arrested but was released 50 minutes later after telling police it was an accident. He claimed that he had just 'brushed into someone' and had no idea that it was Mr Cameron . ‘This is a serious breach of security,’ he told the Mail. ‘There should have been a proper formation and a strategy where you have an inner and outer ring of protection officers, with uniformed officers as back-up, acting in a deterrent capacity. ‘If that had happened, this man would have got nowhere near the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister could be in intensive care or worse now. There must be a review of his security and the protection of the senior figures in the Government.’ But the runner who sparked the security alert said he didn’t even know it was the Prime Minister he bumped into – and accused police of assault. Mr Farley claimed he had merely ‘brushed into someone’ and had no idea it was Mr Cameron, who was in Leeds announcing plans to upgrade rail links in the North. The jogger was arrested and held for 50 minutes before being released. West Yorkshire Police said it was ‘nothing sinister, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time’. Chief Inspector Derek Hughes said: ‘No threats were made, and after the man’s details were checked, he was allowed on his way.’ The Prime Minister later made light of the scare, joking about Labour’s former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, who punched a protester in 2001 who had thrown eggs at him. Mr Cameron said: ‘John Prescott was in the room as I gave the speech so as I left, I thought the moment of maximum danger had probably passed. But clearly that wasn’t the case.’ He said he had confidence in his police bodyguards. But Mr Davis said: ‘I am astonished that given the current threat level, there was a paucity of protection given that he is a worldwide target. If there had been two or more attackers plotting a coordinated attack, the Prime Minister might not be here. 'On the video you can clearly see Mr Cameron is left standing alone completely vulnerable for five to six seconds while all attention was on this man. No one gets him safely in the vehicle.’ 'Security breach': Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection, said police had serious questions to answer about their failures to protect Mr Cameron. Above, the Prime Minister gets into his car following the incident . 'Wrong place, wrong time': Farley, pictured on the floor surrounded by security personnel, said he didn’t even know it was the Prime Minister he bumped into – and accused police of assault . Andy Redhead, a former police firearms officer, also described the lapse as ‘appalling’. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if people on the team are transferred as a result,’ he said, adding: ‘Fortunately the man had no acid, no knife, no firearm.’ The incident comes less than a week after a gunman killed a soldier in an attack at the Canadian parliament in Ottawa. It also follows a scare in the Commons last week when a protester threw a bag of marbles at a protective screen during Prime Minister’s Questions. The Met confirmed that the MPS Specialist Protection Command, which is responsible for protecting the Prime Minister, will review the incident in consultation with West Yorkshire Police. The dreadlocked jogger who caused a major security scare by barging into the Prime Minister yesterday claimed he was the victim of the encounter. Dean Farley, 28, who insisted he had no idea who he bumped into, said he had been assaulted by the PM’s close protection officers. He said on Facebook: ‘So I’m all over the news as “the protester that attacked David Cameron in Leeds”. Yeah... if you call brushing into someone while running then getting assaulted by half a dozen coppers in suits.’ Speaking later on Radio 5 Live, he said he had been on his way to a gym. ‘I ran across the road and all I saw was a bunch of men in suits,’ he said. ‘I dodged in and out and around, next thing I know is I’ve got a half dozen suited men haranguing me and manhandling me to the floor. ‘I didn’t know it was David Cameron. There was no cordon. It begs the question how good is Cameron’s security if I managed to run between it.’","Dean Farley, 28, charged into PM outside Leeds Civic Hall on Monday .

"'Hands up, don't shoot.' Those were the first words out of Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries mouth last night as he and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus took over the House floor for an hour to discuss the August shooting of 18-year-old Ferguson, Missouri, resident Michael Brown. 'It’s a rallying cry of people all across America who are fed up with police violence,' the New York representative said as he kicked off the speeches. 'In community, after community, after community, fed up with police violence in Ferguson, in Brooklyn, in Cleveland, in Oakland, in cities and counties and rural communities all across America.' Scroll down for video . New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries makes the 'hands up don't shoot' gesture on the House floor on Monday night as he kicked off an hour of Congressional Black Caucus speeches on the  shooting of Ferguson, Missouri, resident Michael Brown . During his remarks last night on Ferguson Texas Rep. Al Green lauded the St. Louis Rams players who came onto the field before their game on Sunday evening with their hands up in the air. From left they are: Stedman Bailey (12), Tavon Austin (11), Jared Cook, (89) Chris Givens (13) and Kenny Britt (81). Rep. Jeffries led the charge on behalf of the African-American lawmakers, explaining that they wanted to set aside time to consider what recent events in Ferguson 'say about where we are and where we need to go.' 'People are fed up all across America because of the injustice involved, continuing to see young, unarmed African-American men killed as a result of a gunshot fired by a law enforcement officer,' he said in his opening remarks. 'People in America are fed up with a broken criminal justice system that continues to fail to deliver accountability when law enforcement officers engage in the excessive use of police force. 'People are fed up with prosecutors who don't take seriously their obligation to deliver justice on behalf of the victims of police violence. 'Instead, as we recently saw in Ferguson, Missouri, choose to act as the defense attorney for the law enforcement officer who pulled the trigger and killed Michael Brown,' he accused. Continuing, Jeffries said, 'this is a problem that Congress can’t run away from.' 'The CBC stands here today to make sure that Congress runs toward the problem,' he explained. 'That we come up with constructive solutions to breaking this cycle, this epidemic, this scourge of police violence all across America.' Green is pictured here mimicking the St. Louis Rams' hands up, don't shoot protest during his remarks yesterday on the House floor . President Barack Obama shakes hands with Charles Ramsey, center, Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Dept., following his meeting with elected officials, law enforcement officials and community and faith leaders at the White House on Monday. Obama said that in the wake the Brown shooting he wants to build better trust between police and the communities they serve . 'Hands up, don't shoot': Congresswoman Yvette Clark also began her speech with the mantra on Monday night. 'Young people of color refuse to live in a democratic society in a state of fear,' she told her colleagues . In remarks following Jeffries', Ohio Congresswoman Marcia Fudge said, 'We are running out of patience' to see justice for the black community. Fudge said the nation hoped that last week when the grand jury made its decision in the case of Brown's shooter, former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, 'justice would finally be served.' 'We waited to hear our country say loud and clear, there are consequences for taking the lives of others. We waited to hear loud and clear the reassurance that black and brown boys' lives do matter. 'But again, we were terribly discouraged,' the Democratic lawmaker said, calling it 'yet another slap in our face.' The grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson, who is white, for shooting Brown six times and killing him is a 'painful reminder that 'just like with Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice, and so many others, that law enforcement officers kill our black and brown men and boys without repercussions,' Fudge added. 'Where is the closure for Michael Brown's parents? Where is the understanding for the outrage and desperation of the black community?' she asked. 'The fact that our country, the greatest country in the world, remains mired in race relations issues in the year 2014 is an embarrassment,' Fudge charged. 'We really should taking a long look in the mirror before we go to other countries lecturing to them about democracy and tolerance when here at home, we are unable to fully address our own issues.' Demonstrators rally on Monday against the Missouri grand jury's decision to not indict Darren Wilson for his fatal shooting of Brown. They are standing in front of a mural of Ezell Ford, a black man killed by police two days after Brown, on the corner of Broadway and 65th Street in Los Angeles, California . An LAPD motorcycle officers uses his baton to push back demonstrators as his colleagues detain a man during a protest on Monday in LA . According to Politico, Texas Rep. Al Green later took to the floor to laud St. Louis Rams players who came onto the field before their game on Sunday night with their hands in the air. 'This has become the new symbol, a new statement, a statement wherein people around the country now, are calling to the attention of those who don’t quite understand that this is a movement that will not dissipate, it will not evaporate. It is a movement that is going to continue,' Green reportedly said while mimicking the gesture himself. New York Congresswoman Yvette Clarke also began her speech with the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture. 'We cannot an will not accept the devaluation of African-American lives. We have seen this scenario play out too many times in recent years,' she said. 'Young people of color refuse to live in a democratic society in a state of fear. And we have an obligation as a nation to rid ourselves of the scourge of racially-biased state- sanctioned terrorism,' she said moments later. Brown never made the 'hands up, don't shoot' statement to police officers but it has become the mantra of his supporters. It stems from a friend's claim that Brown put his hands in the air and said, 'I don't have a gun, stop shooting' before being fatally wounded. Monday speeches in the lower chamber followed a day of meetings at the White House between President Barack Obama and civil rights and faith leaders, law enforcement officials, mayors and young activists, two of whom came on behalf of the town of Ferguson. In remarks to the press afterward Obama pledged not to let the national conversation started by the events in Ferguson die and promised to keep fighting to improve the relationship between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve until the end of his term. 'I think there's a maturity of the conversation right now that can lead us to actually getting some concrete results,' he said, and 'I'm going to make sure that we follow through. 'Not to solve every problem, not to tear down every barrier of mistrust that may exist, but to make things better,' he said.","The Congressional Black Caucus took over the House floor for an hour Monday night to discuss the shooting of Ferguson resident Michael Brown .

"Perovskite crystal may be the most abundant material on Earth, but for centuries scientists have failed to get their hands on this elusive mineral. The mysterious substance makes up more than a third of the volume of Earth and is mostly found in the planet's lower mantle 410 to 1,796 miles (660 to 2890 km) beneath the planet's surface. Now, for the first time, US researchers have been able to get a sample of the mineral, and have finally given it a formal name: bridgmanite. The mineral was found by Oliver Tschauner of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and his team in the Tenham meteorite, which had experienced intense pressures over a short period of time . The mineral, which thought to make up roughly 36 per cent of the planet, was named after Percy Bridgman, a US physicist who won the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physics for pressure physics. It was found by Oliver Tschauner of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and his team in the Tenham meteorite, which had experienced intense pressures over a short period of time. 'Despite appearing for decades in numerous experimental and theoretical studies, characterisations of possible natural samples have not been sufficient to meet International Mineralogical Association criteria for naming new minerals,' Professor Tschauner wrote in the journal Science. The mysterious substance makes up more than a third of the volume of Earth and is mostly found in the planet's lower mantle (pictured) 410 to 1,796 miles (660 to 2890 km) beneath the planet's surface . According to International Mineralogical Association rules, a mineral cannot be given a formal name until a specimen has been found that can be studied first hand. 'Consequently, any detailed chemical, structural, and petrographic analysis of natural [bridmanite] has remained impossible,' Professor Tschauner added. The Tenham meteorite hit Australia in 1879 after experiencing temperatures of 2000°C and pressures of 24 gigapascals – conditions similar to those deep inside the Earth. Due to the massive pressures, bridgmanite essentially 'froze' in place before it could decay, forming crystallites within the meteorite. As much as two-thirds of Earth's carbon may be hidden in the inner core, making it the planet's largest carbon reservoir. This is according to a new model that even its backers acknowledge is 'provocative and speculative'. University of Michigan researchers suggest that iron carbide, Fe7C3, is a good match for the density and sound velocities of Earth's inner core. T""The model of a carbide inner core is compatible with existing cosmochemical, geochemical and petrological constraints, but this provocative and speculative hypothesis still requires further testing,"" said Professor Jie Li. 'Should it hold up to various tests, the model would imply that as much as two-thirds of the planet's carbon is hidden in its center sphere, making it the largest reservoir of carbon on Earth."" It is now widely accepted that Earth's inner core consists of crystalline iron alloyed with a small amount of nickel and some lighter elements. However, seismic waves called S waves travel through the inner core at about half the speed expected for most iron-rich alloys under relevant pressures. Some researchers have attributed the S-wave velocities to the presence of liquid, calling into question the solidity of the inner core. The mineral  was named after Percy Bridgman (right), a US physicist who won the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physics for pressure physics. It was found in the Tenham meteorite hit Australia in 1879 (left) Scientists had looked at likely meteorites in the past, but by using electron microscopes to study the material, they ended up inadvertently destroying it. This time, the team used a less destructive test using a micro-focused X-ray beam alongside with electronmicroscopy to keep the sample intact. Its discovery not only allows scientists to finally name the abundant mineral, but also better analyse it to understand how the deep mantle behaves. The researchers claim that the sample has more sodium and ferric acid than they had been expected. They say it might even hold clues about what goes on when rocky bodies in space when they collide, which may offer insights into how the universe formed.

"We've all been there. One slip of the hand, and your mobile hits the pavement with a loud crack, screen-side down. Now Apple believes it has come up with a solution that will allow its iPhones to reorientate themselves mid-air to lessen the impact. While it may sound like something out of a science fiction film, the Cupertino-based company was today awarded a patent to build the system into future handset. The document suggests Apple engineers will use the iPhone's internal vibration motor (right) to control the angle of the fall while it's mid-air. At the same type, various sensors - such as the accelerometer, GPS, gyroscopes and an ultrasonic emitter – would be used to analyse the phone's angle of descent in real-time . The patent includes descriptions of more advanced retractable air foils, similar to the ones Elon Musk is testing for his reusable Space X rockets, according to Tech Insider. It also suggests developing internal mechanisms that jettison headphone cables, as well as tiny gas canisters that create thrust forces to slow down a fall. Initially, however, the document suggests Apple engineers will use the iPhone's internal vibration motor to control the angle of the fall while it's mid-air.

At the same type, various sensors - such as the accelerometer, GPS, gyroscopes and an ultrasonic emitter - would be used to analyse the phone's angle of descent in real-time. A processor can then do a statistical analysis of the fall by comparing gathered data against other information stored in device memory. This information is then sent to the vibration motor to activate its spin and change the phone's centre of gravity. While it may sound like something out of a science-fiction film, the Cupertino-based firm was today awarded a patent to possible create the system on future iPhones.

MIT Technology Review said Mr Jobs' name has appeared on 458 patents so far, including the glass-cube design outside the Apple Store in Manhattan. The very first patent he received was simply titled 'Personal Computer'. Many of Jobs’s patents appear to be on design, such as the the look iPad, rather than on more technical improvements.

"The FBI has joined a search for a 21-year-old college student who disappeared from a busy Philadelphia bar early Thursday morning after getting separated from friends. West Chester University senior Shane Montgomery was last seen leaving Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood around 2am Thursday and hasn't been seen since. According to WPVI, the agency has plastered Montgomery's face on digitized billboards across the city offering a reward of $25,000 for credible information regarding his disappearance. Vanished: Police say Shane Montgomery, 21, was home from West Chester University and met up with some friends on Wednesday night at the crowded Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood, before disappearing . Officials have also begun interviewing staff from the bar, along with friends and family, and have reportedly administered lie detector tests. An FBI spokesperson told WCAU-TV that taskforces from the agency often get involved in cases where people have disappeared under 'suspicious circumstances.' On Sunday, authorities were searching the cold waters of the Manayunk Canal as members of Montgomery's family watched from the banks. 'I want to find Shane and I want to bring him home,' said his mother, Karen Montgomery, to NBC Philadelphia, . Volunteers had been aiding local authorities in the search, but on Sunday family members issued a statement asking them not to gather. 'I just wanted to reach out and remind everyone we are NOT meeting today until we are given the okay from the Marine Unit and Search and Rescue,' a statement on a Facebook page for the search read. Worried: Montgomery's parents, Kevin and Karen, watch as police marine units search the waters for their son on Sunday . Search unit: A Philadelphia Police Marine Unit tried to search the depths of the Manayunk canal in Philadelphia on Sunday . Missing person: A Crime Scene Unit member searches the canal in Manayunk  for Shane Montgomery on Saturday . 'We would like the authorities to be able to do their search thoroughly and without any unintentional interferences from the volunteers.' 'Thank you for the continued prayers, positive thoughts, donations, and shares, as well as a big thank you all the people who have come out in the cold to help us look for Shane.' Police say Montgomery was home for Thanksgiving when he met up  with some friends on Wednesday night at the crowded Kildare's bar. Authorities say he became separated from them and was escorted out by a bouncer around 2am Thursday after stumbling on a bar stool. In the wake of his disappearance, Jim Townsend, the director of operations at Kildare's, came forward to shed light on what happened when Montgomery was last seen. A search of the records at the bar turned up a tab for Montgomery totaling $17, which Townsend told WPVI was for three craft beers. Support: Hundreds of volunteers gather in St. John the Baptist church in Manayunk to organize a search for 21-year-old Shane Montgomery . Reward: Montgomery, who is still unaccounted for, was last seen leaving Kildare's Irish Pub in Manayunk very early Thanksgiving morning, and there is now a $25,000 reward for information on where he is . Missing: Shane Montgomery was last seen Thanksgiving Eve around 1:45am as he was leaving Kildare's bar along Main Street in Philadelphia . He said that Montgomery did not appear intoxicated and though he bumped into the DJ table accidentally, he was polite about it. An employee at Kildare's, who is a relative of Montgomery's, walked him to the exit around closing time and security saw him leave the door and turn south on Main Street. Montgomery's cellphone pinged near the CVS Pharmacy, located less than a mile from Kildare's, about an hour after he was last seen at the bar, but that signal could be picked up at a radius of 4,500 feet. The search began on Thanksgiving, after the college senior, who was visiting his family over the Thanksgiving holiday, did not return to his parents' home that day. Upset: A woman is comforted by another during a candlelight vigil for Shane Montgomery, at a park across from Kildare's Irish Pub in Manayunk on Saturday . Lost: Police say 21-year-old Shane Montgomery was home from West Chester University and met up with friends Wednesday night at a crowded bar . Distinctive: This is a photo of the Celtic cross tattoo on Montgomery's shoulder . On Saturday, about 200 volunteers helped search Main Street in Manayunk and the nearby banks of the Schuylkill  River. Authorities have used K-9s, helicopters and marine units as part of the search. The search was so widespread that the city cancelled a Christmas tree lighting ceremony and caroling activities and instead the organization held a candlelight vigil at the Canal View Park. Montgomery is a liberal arts major and a former high school runner. He is 5-foot-11 and 130 pounds, with short brown hair and green eyes, with a  Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder. Witnesses say he was wearing a buttoned- down gray shirt, gray hoodie and jeans when he left the bar.","Shane Montgomery, 21, left a Philadelphia bar about 2am Thursday .

"The largest private collection of John Lennon's artwork could fetch more than $800,000 (£500,000) at auction later this year. The works, featuring poems, doodles and drawings, were created by the Beatles legend and published in his two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard In The Works. They will be put up for sale as 89 lots at the auction, which is taking place in New York on June 4. Playing the guitar: The largest private collection of John Lennon's artwork is set to fetch more than $800,000 (£500,000) at an auction in New York. Above, one of Lennon's drawings, featuring a figure playing the guitar . Unusual: The works, featuring poems, doodles and drawings, were created by the Beatles legend and published in his two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard In The Works. Above, another sketch . The collection, titled, 'You Might Well Arsk', is owned by Tom Maschler, who published both of Lennon's books in 1964 and 1965 respectively. Mr Maschler, who also founded The Booker Prize, described the Liverpool-born singer's artworks as 'extraordinary'. 'Many are scrawled on the back of hotel notepaper, he said. 'I thought they were extraordinary and asked ""who wrote these?"" He could Imagine: They will be put up for sale as 89 lots at the auction on June 4. Above, Lennon . 'I was told ""John Lennon"" and soon after I met with John and suggested that he should produce John Lennon In His Own Write. 'I then had to inspire in him the confidence to write and produce the drawings. 'John was surprisingly willing to listen to my editorial suggestions. He loved praise, as do we all, but he did not like criticism.' He said the collection, featuring non-sensical poems, witty drawings and cleverly-written manuscripts, reveals a lesser-known side of the famous Beatle, who died in 1980. 'I knew that John had the most extraordinary talent and imagination, but I feared that being a Beatle might mean he wouldn't be taken seriously as a writer and artist,' he said. 'But I was wrong. His writing was even compared to Hilaire Belloc and Edward Lear. 'His art, however, has always been underrated - I very much hope that this auction will redress the balance.' Lennon, a keen writer since his days as a schoolboy in Liverpool, studied art at the Liverpool School of Art before gaining worldwide fame as a member of The Beatles. Speaking at the time about his . artworks, the singer said: 'They are spontaneous. I hardly ever alter . anything because I'm selfish about what I write or big-headed about it.' He . added: 'Once I've written it, I like it. And the publisher sometimes . says, you know, ""Should we leave this out, or change that?"" and I fight . like mad becase once I've done it I like to keep it. Quirky: Tom Maschler, who published the Liverpool singer's books in 1964 and 1965 respectively, described the artworks as 'extraordinary'. Above, a poem about a budgie (left) and a drawing (right), both created by Lennon . 'I might add things when I go over it before it's published, but I seldom take anything out. So it is spontaneous.' And his creativity has certainly been received positively by others - with Mr Maschler describing Lennon as having 'the most original sense of humour'. 'John was an exceptional friend and a most unusual human being,' he said. 'Revisiting the creative process that led to these remarkable books has made me realise just how much I miss him.'

"These otherworldly images give a rare glimpse inside caves so remote few humans have ever stepped foot inside. With its peculiar pools of water, and strange coloured sediments, the bizarre-looking tunnels of the Shakuranskaya cave could be straight out of a science fiction film. Found in the disputed region of Abkhazia, around 75 miles outside of Sochi, Russia, it is rumoured the incredible underground chambers were formed after a huge earthquake struck the area in 1892. Surreal images from Abkhazia offer a rare glimpse inside remote caves that few humans have ever set foot inside . The incredible shots were taken by Vladimir Mulde, who spent the day photographing his friends in the cave, like Pavel (pictured right) After causing part of a nearby mountain to collapse into the Amtkel River, it is thought the dam-like affect has created a series of interconnecting underground tunnels. The incredible images were taken by Russian photographer, Vladimir Mulde, 31, who spent the day with a small group of friends tentatively making his way through the rarely seen terrain to capture the cavern on camera. Amazingly, many parts of the cave are completely submerged underwater meaning much of it is still yet to be seen.

'The walls are smooth in places and the reflection off the water creates interesting forms that makes you feel as if the cave is alive. 'We were surprised to find a huge opening, the colossal stalagmites and stalactites took our breath away. 'It took us the whole day to explore the cave inside and then get out again, it was like being in a completely different world.

"Details of an amazing American military plan for an attack to wipe out a major part of the British Army  are today revealed for the first time. In 1930, a mere nine years before the outbreak of World War Two, America drew up proposals specifically aimed at eliminating all British land forces in Canada and the North Atlantic, thus destroying Britain's trading ability and bringing the country to its knees. Previously unparalleled troop movements . were launched as an overture to an invasion of Canada, which was to . include massive bombing raids on key industrial targets and the use of . chemical weapons, the latter signed off at the highest level by none . other than the legendary General Douglas MacArthur. The plans, revealed in a Channel 5 documentary, were one of a number of military contingency plans drawn up against a number of potential enemies, including the Caribbean islands and China. There was even one to combat an internal uprising within the United States. In the end there was no question of President Franklin D. Roosevelt subscribing to what was known as War Plan Red. Instead the two countries became the firmest of allies during WW2, an occasionally strained alliance that continues to this day. Still, it is fascinating that there were enough people inside the American political and military establishment who thought that such a war was feasible. While outside of America, both Churchill and Hitler also thought it a possibility during the 30s - a time of deep economic and political uncertainty. In 1930, a mere nine years before the outbreak of World War Two, America drew up a terrifying plan specifically aimed at eliminating all British land forces in Canada and the North Atlantic, thus destroying Britain's trading ability and bringing our country to its knees . The top-secret papers seen here -  once regarded as the most sensitive on Earth - were found buried deep within the American National Archives in Washington, D.C. The highly classified files reveal that huge pushes were to be made into the Caribbean and West Coast to block any British retaliation from either Europe, India or Australia. In 1931, the U.S. government even authorised record-breaking transatlantic flying hero and known Nazi sympathiser Charles A. Lindbergh to be sent covertly as a spy to the west shore of Hudson Bay to . investigate the possibility of using sea-planes for warfare and seek out points . of low resistance as potential bridgeheads. In 1931, the U.S. authorised flying hero and known Nazi sympathiser Charles Lindbergh to be sent as a spy to Hudson Bay to look into using sea-planes for warfare and seek out points of low resistance as potential bridgeheads . Four years later, the U.S. Congress authorised $57million to be allocated for the building of three secret airfields on the U.S. side of the Canadian border, with grassed-over landing strips to hide their real purpose. All governments make 'worst case scenario' contingency plans which are kept under wraps from the public. These documents were unearthed buried deep within the American National Archives in Washington, D.C. - a top-secret document once regarded as the most sensitive on earth. It was in 1930, that America first wrote a plan for war with 'The Red Empire' - its most dangerous empire. But America's foe in this war was not Russia or Japan or even the burgeoning Nazi Germany. Plan Red was code for an apocalyptic war with Britain and all her dominions. After the 1918 Armistice and throughout the 1920s, America's historic anti-British feelings handed down from the 19th century were running dangerously high due to our owing the U.S. £9billion for their intervention in The Great War. British feeling against America was known to be reciprocal. By the 1930s, America saw the disturbing sight . of homegrown Nazi sympathisers marching down New York's Park Avenue to converge on a pro-Hitler rally in Madison Square Garden. Across the Atlantic, Britain had the largest empire in the world, not to mention the most powerful navy. Against this backdrop, some Americans . saw their nation emerging as a potential world leader and knew only too well . how Britain had dealt with such upstarts in the past - it went to war and . quashed them. Now, America saw itself as the underdog in a similar . scenario. In 1935, America staged its largest-ever military manoeuvres, moving troops to and installing munitions dumps at Fort Drum, half an hour away from the eastern Canadian border. By the 1930s, America saw the disturbing sight of homegrown Nazi sympathisers marching down New York's Park Avenue to converge on a pro-Hitler rally in Madison Square Garden . It was from here the initial attack on British citizens would be launched, with Halifax, . Nova Scotia, its first target. 'This . would have meant six million troops fighting on America's eastern . seaboard,' says Peter Carlson, editor of American History magazine. During the 1920s and 30s, the U.S. devised several colour-coded war plans to deal with potential adversaries. Many of these war games were submitted to the Military Information Division by officers working in their own time. Among the contingency plans developed were: . Orange: War against Japan . Green: Against Mexico . Purple: South America . White: Domestic uprising . Black: Germany . Grey: Caribbean republics . Yellow: China . Brown: Philippines . Not surprisingly, many of these were hypothetical exercises - and provided only broad strategic outlines. However, the planning was considered by the military to be good practice for its personnel. 'It would have been like Verdun,' alluding to the brutal conflict between German and French troops in 1916 . which resulted in a death toll of 306,000. Even Winston Churchill said while people regarded . a war with the U.S. as inconceivable, it was not. 'America felt Britain had thrown it under . the bus in order to stay top dog,' says Professor Mike Vlahos, of the U.S. Naval War College. 'The U.S. was forced to contemplate any measure . to keep Britain at bay.' Even Hitler thought such a war was inevitable, . but astonishingly wanted Britain to win, believing that to be the best outcome . for Germany, since the UK could then join his forces to attack the U.S. 'You have to remember the U.S. was born out of a . revolutionary struggle against Britain in 1776,' says Dr. John H. Maurer, of . the U.S. Naval War College. Using available blueprints for this war, . modern-day military and naval experts now believe the most likely outcome of . such a conflict would have been a massive naval battle in the North Atlantic . with very few actual deaths, but ending with Britain handing Canada over to the . U.S. in order to preserve our vital trade routes. However, on June 15, 1939, the same year as the German invasion of Poland, an . internal U.S. memo states these plans for an invasion were 'wholly . inapplicable', but nevertheless 'should be retained' for the future. This is now seen as the dawn of and prime reason . behind the 'special relationship' between our two countries. Huge troop movements were launched as an overture to an invasion of Canada, which was to include bombing raids on industrial targets and the use of chemical weapons - the latter signed off by the legendary General Douglas MacArthur, left (file picture) Isolationism, prosperity and decline: America after WWI . As close allies in numerous conflicts, Britain and America have long enjoyed a 'special relationship'. Stemming from Churchill and Roosevelt, it has since flourished - from Thatcher and Reagan, and Clinton and Blair, to the Queen and Obama. We know now that FDR ultimately rejected an invasion of Britain as 'wholly inapplicable'. But just how special was that relationship in the decade leading up to WWII? By the start of the 1920s, the American economy was booming. The 'Roaring Twenties' was an age of increased consumer spending and mass production. But after the First World War, U.S. public opinion was becoming increasingly isolationist. This was reflected in its refusal to join the League of Nations, whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. U.S. foreign policy continued to cut itself off from the rest of the world during that period by imposing tariffs on imports to protect domestic manufacturers. These children were part of a squatter community, known bitterly as 'Hoovervilles' because of the President's inability to even admit to the existence of a national crisis after the stock market crash in 1929 . And its liberal . approach to immigration was also changing. Millions of people, mainly from . Europe, had previously been welcomed to America in search of a better life. But by 1921, quotas were introduced and, by 1929, only 150,000 immigrants per year were allowed in. After a decade of prosperity and optimism, America was thrown into despair when the stock market crashed in October 1929 - marking the start of the Great Depression. The ensuing economic hardship and mass unemployment sealed the fate of President Herbert Hoover's re-election - and Franklin D Roosevelt stormed to victory in March 1933. He was faced with an economy on the brink of collapse: banks had been shut in 32 states, and some 17million . people had been thrown out of work — almost a third of the adult . workforce. And the reality of a worldwide economic depression and the need for increased . attention to domestic problems only served to bolster the idea that the U.S. should isolate itself from troubling events in Europe. When Franklin D Roosevelt was elected as President in 1933, he was faced with an economy on the brink of collapse. Banks had been shut in 32 states, and some 17million people had been thrown out of work . However, this view was at odds with FDR's vision. He realised the necessity for the U.S. to participate more actively in international affairs - but isolationist sentiment remained high in Congress. In 1933, President Roosevelt proposed a Congressional measure that . would have granted him the right to consult with other nations to place pressure . on aggressors in international conflicts. The bill faced strong opposition . from leading isolationists in Congress. As tensions rose in Europe over the rise of the Nazis, Congress brought in a set of Neutrality Acts to stop  America becoming entangled in external . conflicts. Although Roosevelt was not in favour of the policy, he acquiesced as he still needed Congressional support for his New Deal programmes, which were designed to bring the country out of the Depression. By 1937, the situation in Europe was growing worse and the second Sino-Japanese War began in Asia. In a speech, he compared international aggression to a disease that other nations must work to 'quarantine'. But still, Americans were not willing to risk their lives for peace abroad - even when war broke out in Europe in 1939. A slow shift in public opinion saw limited U.S. aid to the Allies. And then the Japanese attack on Pear Harbor in December 1941 changed everything.","Emerging world power feared British reaction to its ambitions .

But he thinks Van Gaal can lead United into the Champions League places – and would relish the prospect of dueling with his former side in Europe’s elite competition again. ‘Sometimes the coaches need time to change the team to what they want,’ said Ronaldo. ‘In the Premier League all the teams are fighting a lot for points and even the clubs at the bottom of the table can beat those at the top. So it is tough. ‘I read something recently from Sir Alex Ferguson saying Van Gaal will need time and he is right. In the beginning even Sir Alex didn’t win anything for a few years and it was a complicated time for him while he got the team together that he wanted. ‘To get a good squad and a good team takes time so lets give Van Gaal the time he needs. He is a fantastic coach and very experienced and I am certain he will make United champions again, if not this year then very spoon after that.’ Di Maria has performed best of all the players bought in Van Gaal’s £156million summer spree – scoring or assisting seven goals in his six Premier League games. Ronaldo is still in touch with his former Real team-mate and says the Argentine will raise his game against Mourinho’s men. Ronaldo: ‘I read something recently from Sir Alex Ferguson saying Van Gaal will need time and he is right' ‘To change Spain for England is always going to be a big difference because the weather is not the same in Manchester as it is in Madrid. It's colder, often raining and always cloudy,’ said Ronaldo. ‘Of course it is going to be a big, big challenge for him but I am 100% sure he will be a massive success at United. He will enjoy it I know. CLICK HERE for the match report from Real Madrid's 3-1 win over Barcelona . ‘It’s great that he might be fit to play Chelsea because Angel was always an important player for Real Madrid in the big games – he always rises to the occasion.’ Ronaldo believes this season is too soon for United to reclaim the title, but is rooting for his old club to finish in the top four. ‘Let’s see. They aren't in a good moment because they have dropped many points but they have a good coach and we need to give him time and see what happens. ‘It would be amazing and good news for me if they did make the Champions League because I would love to play against them again. Ronaldo believes this season is too soon for United to reclaim the title, but thinks they can finish in the top four . Ronaldo says 'you can never write off Manchester United' but that Chelsea are already too far ahead this year . ‘You can never write off Manchester United. It is only the beginning but it will be tough for United to win the title this year I think because they are already too many points behind Chelsea in my opinion. ‘Chelsea are a little bit stronger than all the other teams this year. But of course in the Premier League over a season you never know what can happen. That period near Christmas is really tough and you can easily drop points because there are a lot of games in a really short space of time. ‘Chelsea have made a great start and they can be champions. I hope Manchester United can come again at the top of the league. ‘At the moment they are many points behind Chelsea and have had some disappointing results at the start of the season. But let's see what happens it is an exciting league and anything can happen.’ Van Gaal's Manchester United go into Sunday's Premier League match against Chelsea sitting eighth .","Cristiano Ronaldo says Louis van Gaal can lead Manchester United to glory .

"Doctors in Belgium are killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia, new figures have revealed. The statistics also show a huge 27 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia cases in the last year alone. The soaring number of deaths will inevitably fuel fears that euthanasia is out of control in Belgium, a country which only months ago became the first in the world to allow doctors to kill terminally ill children. There have been a surge in the number of euthanasia deaths in Belgium since it was legalised in 2003. Earlier this year there were protests to stop the law being extended to children . The figures, published in Sudpresse, Belgium’s leading French-speaking newspaper, showed that 1,816 cases of euthanasia were reported in 2013 compared to to 1,432 in 2012, an overall increase of 26.8 per cent. ‘You could say that currently there are 150 cases of euthanasia per month in Belgium or, even more telling, five people euthanised a day,’ the newspaper said. Of the total number of cases in 2013, 51.7 per cent were male patients and 48.3 per cent were female. Elderly people aged between 70 and 90 years made up just over half (53.5 per cent) of the total. Those aged between 60 and 70 years represented 21 per cent and those aged over 90 years seven per cent. The under-60s accounted for just 15 per cent of the total number of cases. In . 2003 Belgium was the second country in the world to legalise euthanasia . after Holland liberalised the law a year earlier, becoming the first . country since Nazi Germany to permit the practice. Over the past decade the numbers of Belgians dying by euthanasia has crept up incrementally. Controversial: In February, the Belgian House of Representatives voted in favour of extending the policy to children who are terminally-ill or in a state of unrelieved suffering . There was a 25 per cent increase in the number of euthanasia deaths from 2011 to 2012, soaring from 1,133 to 1,432, a figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country. In February Belgium extended euthanasia to children who are terminally-ill and in a state of unrelieved suffering. They must also be judged to have ‘capacity of discernment’, affirmed by a psychologist, and the consent of their parents before they can die by injection. Anti-euthanasia campaigners have argued that such safeguards have consistently proved to be meaningless. They say that besides patients who are gravely ill euthanasia is used increasingly on people with depression or non-terminal conditions. Those killed include deaf twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, who were granted their wish to die in December 2012 after they learned they would likely to become blind. Last year Nancy Verhelst, 44, a transsexual, was also killed by euthanasia after doctors botched her sex change operation, leaving her with physical deformities she felt made her look like a ‘monster’. Disability rights campaigner Nikki Kenward of the UK-based Distant Voices pressure group said the figures demonstrated the difficulties in regulating euthanasia. She said that once a country legalised assisted suicide or euthanasia people were inevitably killed in greater numbers than ever envisaged. The figures should serve as a warning to the Parliament not to change the law on homicide to allow even assisted suicide, she said. ‘As the numbers of people dying from euthanasia in Belgium grow, that slippery slope comes into vision,’ said Mrs Kenward of Aston on Clun, Shropshire. ‘I am vulnerable,’ said Mrs Kenward, who has been in a wheelchair since the 1990s when she developed Guillain Barre syndrome. ‘I’m afraid of becoming another statistic, another faceless victim,’ she said, adding: ‘We are told that safeguards will protect us from abuses. They certainly do not protect the elderly in Belgium.’","Rise in deaths will fuel fears about country's controversial policies .

"The Colombian women's cycling team were meant to be showing the world what they were made of as they posed in their new kit this week. But they appeared to show a little too much as all eyes were drawn to the bizarre new flesh-coloured design stretching across their lower torso. As the smiling athletes took to the stage, they seemed blissfully unaware of the blunder, which left them looking completely exposed at the groin. Scroll down for video . Strip-tease:  Colombian women's cycling team proudly pose in their startling new kit design in Italy this week . The Colombian team, which is sponsored by the country's capital city of Bogota, was wearing the outfit to take part in a cycling competition in Italy. The race is held in honour of former Italian champion, Michela Fanini, whose promising career was cut short when she died in a car crash in 1994 at just 21 years old.. It is difficult to ascertain whether the outrageous new strip was a publicity stunt or a genuine fashion faux-pas but the team may think twice about turning out in it again. The design has caused a stir on social media - with many ranking it among the worst kits ever seen at a sporting event. Some joked on Twitter that they had gone out to buy the kit, while others criticised the stunt for going too far. Comparisons were also made with other sporting fashion mishaps- such as the Scottish team's kit at this summer's Commonwealth Games which involved a strange tartan and blue spotted design. Bare ambition: The six athletes pose for a photo with one of their coaches ahead of this week's race . The Footon Servetto Fuji Tour de France 2010 squad had a similarly embarrassing moment when they revealed their kit - complete with a ridiculous bulging groin .

"UFO enthusiasts claim to have spotted Barack Obama's head on the Martian surface. They says a panoramic image from 2005 taken by the Spirit rover shows a rock shaped uncannily like the President's head - and that it could be part of a statue. It is the latest in a long line of claims of heads and other structures on the thousands of images sent back from the Martian surface by Nasa's rovers. Scroll down for video . Is this Obama? UFO enthusiasts claim the rock looks like the President's head . The image is taken from the Spirit Rover's Pancam 'Everest' panorama, acquired on sols 620 to 622 (October 1 to 3, 2005) from a position in the Columbia Hills at the true summit of Husband Hill on the Martian surface. The summit region is a broad plateau about 100 meters (300 feet) above the surrounding plains of Gusev crater, consisting mostly of outcrop rocks and windblown drifts. 'Searching for structures on Mars I found this head,' said Scott Waring of the UFO Sightings Daily blog. 'From the way its standing up I would say that it is a full statue, but is buried from the shoulders down. ' He believes the structure in 3D printed. However, another UFO enthusiast, writing on UFO Sightings Hotspot, altered the image on a computer and found Obama's head was revealed. 'By cleaning the image in a software program, . I discovered that this relic has an uncanny resemblance to the United States president, Barack Obama.' The original image is taken from the Spirit Rover's Pancam 'Everest' panorama, acquired on sols 620 to 622 (October 1 to 3, 2005) from a position in the Columbia Hills at the true summit of Husband Hill on the Martian surface. It was released online by Nasa, and even turned into an interactive panorama. Where's Obama? The original image of the Martian surface. The image is taken from the Spirit Rover's Pancam 'Everest' panorama, acquired on sols 620 to 622 (October 1 to 3, 2005) from a position in the Columbia Hills at the true summit of Husband Hill on the Martian surface. As the image is zoomed in, a skull-like rock becomes more visible . The summit region of Mars is a broad plateau about 100 meters (300 feet) above the surrounding plains of Gusev crater, consisting mostly of outcrop rocks and windblown drifts. The image is the latest in a series claiming to show faces on Mars. Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimuli. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in random, unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places, especially the faces of religious figures. Although UFO experts say the rock has the fave of President Obama, experts say it is simply a case of Pareidolia, the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the word Allah. For example, in September 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers in Singapore to pay homage to the Monkey god. Another famous instance was when Mary's face was a grilled cheese sandwich. Images of Jesus have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of Marmite and in a potato. For the the last few decades Nasa has spent billions of dollars on a variety of missions to Mars to find out if the planet might once have been habitable. But has a YouTube blogger found evidence for past life on Mars in the form of a human face-like rock hidden in an old Nasa photo? The answer, of course, is an emphatic 'no', but that hasn't stopped the UFO enthusiast from suggesting that the rock may be a sign the planet was once inhabited. On his website UFO Sightings Daily Mr Waring said he has 'found a new face' on Mars. The discovery was seemingly made by the Sojourner rover on Mars back on 22 July 1997, but not unearthed by Mr Waring until now. In a video he expresses bafflement that Nasa has pointed out features on Mars, including the face, with arrows in the image. 'This rover found some objects and Nasa was pointing them out with different arrows. 'I was just thinking 'wow Nasa's really not helping us at all find any of these objects on Mars' and bam, there is an arrow pointing right to the face.' The actual 'face' spotted by Mr Waring is in the bottom left of the main image. It appears to bear a resemblance to a human face with a nose, chin, eyes and so on. Sadly for Mr Waring and similar UFO enthusiasts, this rock like so many others has a simple explanation. Scott Waring has previously claimed  he has found signs of life in an old Nasa photo (Mr Waring has highlighted the 'facial' features to the right). The image comes from the Washington-based agency's first rover on Mars, called Sojourner, which landed on Mars on 4 July 1997. In the image the rock seems to have a human-like appearance . Sojourner was a rover that travelled with the Mars Pathfinder mission. It landed on Mars on 4 July 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet. It was designed to last just seven days on Mars but stayed active for 83 Martian days, eventually losing communication with Earth on 27 September 1997. In its time on Mars the rover travelled a bit more than 330ft (100 metres) The rover returned more than 550 images and, through chemical analyses of rocks and soil, also suggested that Mars may have once been warm and wet. Namely, it is simply a chance alignment that tricks the brain into thinking it is seeing a face - known as face pareidolia. Mr Waring also added: 'Of course Nasa noticed it, but they didn't label the reason for the arrow.' However, looking up the image in Nasa's library of images reveals the true reasons for the arrows. 'The large rounded rocks in the distance, marked by the red arrows, are comparable to 'Yogi' said Nasa. Yogi, found previously by Sojourner, was the first rock on Mars found to be made of basalt, which suggested the planet was once volcanic. Its smoothness also hinted at a wet past for the planet. 'A second population of smaller, angular rocks (blue arrows) in the foreground have unweathered surfaces even on the downwind side, except where covered on their tops by drift' Nasa continued. 'The third kind of rock (white arrows) is white and flat, and includes 'Scooby Doo' in the foreground.' 'Scooby doo' was a pink rock that was coated with a crusty substance and contained a lot of rust. Mr Waring says this indicates the planet was once inhabited. However the rock is nothing more than a case of pareidolia - when our brain tricks us into see human faces in objects like Jesus in toast. Nasa also said the arrows simply showed different types of rock . The image was taken by Nasa's Sojourner rover on 22 July 1997. This particular rock had an unweathered surface that appeared to have been unaffected by wind on Mars - but it was not a sign that some sort of intelligent civilisation carved a face into the rock . The agency explains how the image is a 360-degree colour gallery pan looking to the northeast of Mars. In it the colours have been exaggerated to highlight the differences between rocks and soils. The image is actually fairly remarkable as it is one of the first images ever taken by a rover - in this case Sojourner - on Mars. Sojourner (seen here with the Yogi rock) was a rover that travelled with the Mars Pathfinder mission. It landed on Mars on 4 July 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet. It was designed to last just seven days on Mars but stayed active for 83 Martian days until 27 September 1997 .","Image comes from Nasa's Spirit Rover .

"Norman Baker, the new Home Office Minister who believes MI5 covered up the murder of Dr David Kelly, will not be granted access to classified documents on counter-terrorism issues. The Home Office told spy chiefs the Liberal Democrat conspiracy theorist will not learn their secrets, security sources said. Whitehall officials say ministers are given security clearance on a ‘need-to-know basis’ and Mr Baker’s brief, dubbed ‘drugs and drunks’, will mean he is frozen out of security issues. Closed book: Lib Dem conspiracy theorist Norman Baker, left, will not learn MI5 secrets. His appointment is said to have angered Home Secretary Theresa May, right . Home Secretary Theresa May was said to be ‘spitting tacks’ over Mr Baker’s appointment in Monday’s reshuffle. Yesterday he made it clear he will try to force through a more ‘liberal’ drugs policy than pre-decessor Jeremy Browne – which could include pressing for the decriminalisation of cannabis. The maverick minister wrote a book in 2007 claiming weapons inspector Dr Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad, while the security services hushed it up. He has also claimed the death of former foreign secretary Robin Cook was suspicious. Insiders stressed that only the Home Secretary sees top secret files and authorises surveillance missions. In her absence, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers would step in. Mr Baker yesterday insisted that he has ‘closed the door’ on his obsession with Dr Kelly. He said: ‘The work was published in 2007. I then closed the door and moved on to other things.’ But he admitted submitting Freedom of Information requests about Dr Kelly as recently as 2010. Mr Baker added: ‘I entirely respect the work of MI5 and the security services.’ Morning after: Mrs May arrived at Downing Street for a Cabinet meeting yesterday, still reeling from the news of her new Lib Dem colleague .

"Adrian Peterson today arrived at a New York hearing to fight back against his indefinite suspension from the National Football League for whipping his four-year-old son with a wooden switch. The Minnesota Vikings running back, who pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault last month, was suspended for the rest of the season for violating the league's personal conduct policy. But donning a dark blue suit and white shirt, he arrived at the Manhattan appeal at 9am in a bid to get the suspension overturned. He ducked away from photographers as he entered the building. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arrival: Adrian Peterson was today at a New York hearing to fight back against his indefinite suspension from the National Football League for whipping his  son, aged 4, with a switch. Above, Peterson leaves the hearing . Arrival: Peterson is pictured arriving at the Manhattan-based appeal at 9am amid a crowd of photographers . Dodging cameras: The Minnesota Vikings running back, who pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault last month, was suspended for the rest of the season for violating the league's personal conduct policy . No comment: But donning a dark blue suit and white shirt, he arrived at the appeal this morning in a bid to get the suspension overturned. He ducked away from waiting photographers as he entered the building . The NFL, whose Commissioner Roger Goodell has formerly told Peterson he will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15, has provided no time frame for a ruling once the appeal ends. However, Peterson may have his hopes up following the league's highly-controversial recent decision to overturn its indefinite suspension against Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice. Rice, who was suspended after being filmed knocking out his wife, Janay, in an Atlantic City elevator, won his appeal last Friday, meaning he is now eligible to sign with any NFL team immediately. Peterson, who has not played for the Vikings since week one of this season while dealing with the child abuse allegations in Texas, was placed on paid leave while the legal process played out. The 29-year-old disciplined his son using a thin branch last May, leaving severe cuts, welts and bruises on his body. Photos of the boy's injuries were later released by Houston Police Department. On November 4, Peterson avoided jail but received probation, a $4,000 fine and a requirement to perform 80 hours of community service for the 'discipline'. Hearing: Peterson (right), who has not played for the Vikings since week one of this season while dealing with the child abuse allegations in Texas, was placed on paid leave while the legal process played out . Running back: However, Peterson (pictured in 2012) may have his hopes up following the league's highly-controversial recent decision to overturn its indefinite suspension against Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice . Form of 'discipline': Peterson disciplined his son using a thin branch last May, leaving severe cuts, welts and bruises on his body. Photos of the boy's injuries (above) were later released by Houston Police Department . But Goodell, who imposed the season-long suspension on November 18, told the player in an open letter: 'You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct. 'When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not ""eliminate whooping my kids"" and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother. 'You also said that you felt ""very confident with my actions because I know my intent"". 'These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.' Peterson, who said he was similarly disciplined as a child, was backed by the NFL Players Association, which called the punishment 'unprecedented, arbitrary, and unlawful.' Reinstated: Peterson may have his hopes up following the league's highly-controversial recent decision to overturn its indefinite suspension against Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice (pictured with his wife, Janay) Partying: Rice, who was suspended after being filmed knocking out his wife in an Atlantic City elevator, won his appeal last Friday, meaning he is now eligible to sign with any NFL team. He later went out partying (pictured) The union has argued that the player should get credit for time served on the exempt list. Although Rice was reinstated by the NFL last week, Peterson's case is very different. The former had already served an initial two-game suspension when he was suspended indefinitely by the league. This led an arbitrator to argue that he was a victim of double jeopardy. Meanwhile, Peterson's indefinite suspension is the first and only punishment he has received. In addition, while Rice faced a former federal judge with no NFL affiliation, Peterson is making his case to Judge Harold Henderson, a longtime counsel to the league, ABC reported. Previous appearance: Peterson, pictured laughing beside his wife, Ashley, in October, avoided jail but received probation, a $4,000 fine and  80 hours of community service for the 'discipline' of his son in May this year . Rice - who sparked outrage when he was pictured partying just hours after winning his appeal - and Peterson are not the only footballer stars in the limelight for alleged assaults. Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston's  code of conduct hearing is also scheduled to start today following claims he sexually assaulted a female student. Winston has maintained his innocence and was cleared of criminal charges earlier this year.","Adrian Peterson, 29, arrived at hearing in Manhattan, New York, today .

"A 77-year-old American man was killed when a small plane crashed near New Providence Island in the Bahamas on Tuesday. The crash also injured the 10 other people on board who have been hospitalized. Their conditions were not immediately known. Police have not yet identified the man who died or his hometown, but initial reports from Bahamas Press said he died of a heart attack. The Southern Air chartered plane departed the island of Eleuthera (pictured) headed for Lynden Pindling International Airport on Tuesday morning with 11 people on board . The 10 survivors, including one child, were rescued by a team from the nearby Stuart Cove’s Aqua Adventures and taken by ambulance to Doctors Hospital in Nassau . Superintendent Paul Rolle said the 10-seat Navajo Chieftain went down after departing the nearby island of Eleuthera on Tuesday morning at approximately 8am. The plane was operated by Ferguson Air and was serving as a charter for Southern Air. Police told the Bahamas Press that the pilot was Rufus Ferguson and that he survived. Ferguson alerted officials that he was having problems and tried getting the plane close to shallow water before it lost power some 550 feet (170 meters) from the coast near Clifton Pier in western New Providence. Pilot Rufus Ferguson, who survived, was flying the plane when it went down near New Providence Island, according to local reports . The 10 survivors, including one child, were rescued by a team from the nearby Stuart Cove’s Aqua Adventures and taken by ambulance to Doctors Hospital in Nassau, according to Bahamas newspaper The Tribune. They were four Bahamians and six Americans, according to reports. Officials said the twin-engine plane was heading from Governor's Harbour, Eleuthera to the Lynden Pindling International Airport when it went down. Early reports said the plane, operated by Southern Air, may have lost an engine. The wreckage sank after impact according to Bahamas Press. The crash was the second fatal plane incident in a month in the Bahamas. In early November, Dr Myles Munroe, Bahamas' most famous minister, and eight others died in an accident, believed to have been caused by turbulent weather. Munroe was traveling in the Lear 36 Executive Jet with his wife Ruth and several members of their Evangelical congregation to Grand Bahama to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum that he organized. As the pilot attempted to land in Freeport, the aircraft careered into a shipping container crane, killing everyone on board.","Ten others were rescued and have been hospitalized .

"Fran McGlinn played a key member of his high school basketball team despite being diagnosed with a debilitating heart condition . A Philadelphia Catholic high school basketball coach has been fired after he was allegedly identified as being part of the group that brutally attacked a gay couple. Fran McGlinn, 25, is said to have been among about dozen men and women in their twenties who participated in the attack on a 28- and 26-year-old gay couple, according to Philadelphia Daily News. One of the victims told CBS Philadelphia that three men started 'pummeling' him and knocked him to the ground. The two men were walking near 16th and Chancellor streets in the Center City area of Philadelphia just before 11pm on September 11 when the group of men and women confronted them, the 28-year old told CBS Philadelphia. His 26-year-old boyfriend said that the men in the group asked if the two were a couple and, when he confirmed, the men began to pummel them both. The 28-year-old had to be hospitalized with a large cut on his face. His jaw had to be wired shut due to severe fractures. The 26-year-old boyfriend suffered bruises to his face, CBS Philadelphia reports. Kenneth Gavin, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, told the Daily News that McGlinn has been fired and prohibited from working at any archdiocesan school. Seen on camera: The group of about 12 white men and women were caught on video walking in Rittenhouse Square . Gavin said that McGlinn had been serving as a coach on a 'contract basis' at the high school and was not a teacher. McGlinn graduated from Wood High School in 2007 and was a key member of the school's men's varsity basketball team, the Wood Vikings. The Daily News reported that McGlinn continued to be a member of the basketball team, AAU teams as well as attending practices despite suffering from a debilitating heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. McGlinn wrote in an online profile that after being diagnosed, doctor's told him that he could 'never play basketball again.' People have taken to social media to aid authorities in the search for the 'persons of interest.' After news of the attack spread, internet sleuths used social media to help identify the people said to have been involved in the incident. Photographed here, the more than a dozen men and women who are 'people of interest' in the same-sex couple attack, are seen dining at La Viola . Fine dining: The group was photographed dining at La Viola restaurant near Rittenhouse Square prior to the attack. The restaurant has since come under fire by social media users . Particularly, CBS Philadelphia reported, that one Twitter user utilized his more than 6,000 followers to identify the alleged attackers.  One follower tweeted a photo of the group at a restaurant prior to the time of the attack as a result of the user's efforts. The Twitter user told CBS Philadelphia that he would use photos his followers would send him and match them to a surveillance video released by authorities. Since the investigation began, social media users have uncovered that the group dined at a Center City restaurant called La Viola just before the time of the attack. The surveillance video shows the group walking near Rittenhouse Square. The restaurant itself has since come under fire from social media users even though its officials say they were in no way involved in the attack. Person of interest: A new 'person of interest' was interviewed by authorities, he refused to comment . CBS Philadelphia reported this statement from the restaurant's officials: 'We were horrified to learn any of our patrons could have been involved in such a crime. Our thoughts are with the victims and we wish the gentleman a speedy recovery.' Daily News reports that though the incident was initially investigated as a hate crime, the District Attorney's Office say the case may not fit that standard. Under current law, a hate crime includes incidents motivated by race, ethnicity, or religion -- not sexual orientation.","Fran McGlinn was fired from Archbishop Wood High School and prohibited from working at any Catholic school in the Philadelphia area .

"There are rumors of romance surrounding Caroline Wozniacki and Washington Redskins player Ryan Kerrigan after the pair attended a charity function together. Wozniacki, whose engagement with top-ranked golfer Rory McIlroy ended very publicly this Spring, was pictured at the DC-area charity event with the linebacker on Monday night. According to CSN Washington, the two spent the evening in close proximity and quiet conversation, though both declined to comment on their relationship status. There are rumors of romance surrounding Caroline Wozniacki and Washington Redskins player Ryan Kerrigan after the pair attended a charity function together (pictured) on Monday night . When they arrived at the live auction to benefit a D.C. area high school athletic department, Kerrigan hovered by the 24-year-old's side and looked on slightly awkwardly as she chatted to fellow guests. Kerrigan, 26, spoke at the event, but not about his date, and Wozniacki turned down attempts for interviews. Later in the night they were snapped talking as they sat down at a table, although they were careful to remain neutral in their body image. Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated $24million, was due to be married last month, but McIlroy ended their relationship at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations. Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated $24million, was due to be married last month, but McIlroy ended their relationship at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations . At the time, the Northern Irish golfer said the end of the three-year relationship was 'mutual and amicable' - but now Wozniacki has revealed McIlroy broke up with her out of the blue during a ten-minute call and did not even give her 'a face-to-face'. Speaking about the break-up, she told In Depth With Graham Bensinger on Yahoo! News: 'It was very hard because he made it very public from the start. He put out a press release so I didn't have a choice, you know, it just got put in my face. 'Oh I was shocked. I thought at least, you know, I would get a face to face or something. But there was nothing – it was just a phone call and I did not hear from him again. ''I don't think you expect to find yourself in a situation like that, you can't prepare yourself or your body for anything like that so I think I was in a bit of a shocked phase there for a while.' She said after she was left 'shocked', but says she now intends to date a taller man. Multi-millionaire McIlroy, who won the coveted British Open in July, announced he and Wozniacki had split earlier this year because he was not ready for 'all that marriage entails'. He later said in a statement released through Dublin-based communications consultants that the 'problem is mine'. At the time, he said it would be difficult to concentrate on the tournament on the back of a public break-up. But days later, McIlroy went on to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. His form continued and, in July, he won the British Open by a clear margin, before going on to win the U.S. PGA Championship. Wozniacki, who was born in Denmark to Polish parents, became world number one in 2012 . Kerrigan is having a good year for his team - he is currently in the top 10 in sacks and forced fumbles in the league, according to EPSN . He later claimed that the break-up was the reason behind his unstoppable form, saying: 'I think what happened has been for the best in terms of my golf. 'I've put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?' According to sources, their wedding was due to take place at the Rockefeller Centre in New York on November 8. In a statement after their break-up, McIlroy said: 'The problem is mine. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails. 'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had.' Ms Wozniacki, who was born in Denmark to Polish parents, became world number one in 2012.

"Real Madrid and Manchester United have sold an average of 1.5million official replica shirts globally each year over the past five years - making them the two most popular shirts in football. The commercial giants of Spanish and English football topped sales numbers from the 2009-10 season to the 2013-14 season inclusive, according to figures from authoritative new research by a leading international sports marketing consultancy. Real Madrid topped the charts, closely followed by Manchester United. Barcelona are No 3 on the sales list, followed by Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool.

Source: PR Marketing . The strength of the Premier League was once again confirmed, with four English clubs featuring in the top 12 most popular shirt sellers. Spain, France and Italy both provided two teams, while Germany and Turkey providing one team each. The biggest surprise perhaps is that despite winning a number of trophies in recent seasons, current Premier League champions Manchester City have not yet translated that success into massive shirt sales. City sold close to 300,000 shirts last season according to the research, but their five-year average is closer to 200,000 per year - not yet enough to bring the club among the biggest sellers. Based on an average shirt price of £40 for a short-sleeved adult shirt, revenues from shirts alone are worth approximately £60million a year to Real Madrid and Manchester United and £35m to the other leading Premier League clubs.

The figures have been compiled by veteran analyst Dr Peter Rohlmann and his team at the consulting bureau, PR Marketing, who have worked as consultants to major brands, leagues and other organisations. Rohlmann says: 'Changes of kit supplier and sporting success - as well as global appeal and international presence - continue to be the main reasons for shirt sales.' In terms of overall merchandise sales – the sale of shirts plus other kit, including boots, tracksuits and other clothing, bags and even club-branded balls (not covered in this research) - it is understood that Manchester United and Liverpool remain the two biggest global sellers, outselling their Spanish rivals.","Real Madrid lead the way by selling an estimated 1.58m shirts per year .

"Bobby Keys, the saxophonist who played with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Buddy Holly, has died at the age of 70 at his home in Tennessee. According to friends Keys had been suffering with long-term liver problems following his well-documented problems with alcohol and heroin. While he played with many Rock 'n Roll legends during the 60s and 70s, Keys was best known for his work with the Stones - including tracks Brown Sugar, Live With Me, and Emotional Rescue. Scroll down for video . Bobby Keys, saxophonist for the Rolling Stones (Pictured left and right, on stage with Keith Richards), has died today after suffering from liver problems following problems with alcohol and heroin in his youth . In a statement, the band said: 'The Rolling Stones are devastated by the loss of their very dear friend and legendary saxophone player, Bobby Keys. 'Bobby made a unique musical contribution to the band since the 1960s. He will be greatly missed.' 'He was a good friend and an inspiration to play with,' said . long-time friend and Nashville rock veteran Michael Webb, who . performed with Keys in a band of Southern rock all-stars called . Bobby Keys and the Suffering Bastards. He added: 'About two months ago, he started wrestling with his health.He has been in and out of (the hospital) several times.' Keys initially made a name for himself playing sax for Buddy Holly at the tender age of 15 in Texas, before playing on Elvis Presley's 'Return to Sender.' From there he was picked up by Eric Clapton for the Derek and the Dominos project and made his way to London, where he fell in with George Harrison, John Lennon, and Keith Moon. He met the Stones in the mid-'60s while they were on the same bill in San Antonio, Texas, and was distraught that the British rockers had recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's Not Fade Away. 'I said, ""Hey, that was Buddy's song"",' Keys recalled in Richards' memoir Life, published in 2010. 'Who are these pasty-faced, funny-talking, skinny-legged guys to come over here and cash in on Buddy's song?' Keys started playing sax for Buddy Holly, and met the Stones when they came to Texas. Outraged that they had covered a Holly song, he went to confront them but was so impressed he joined them instead . Keys (far right, on stage with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts) became famous for his nights of partying. He once missed a Stones show after taking a bath in Dom Perignon champagne . But once Keys listened more closely, he decided the Stones were playing 'actual rock and roll', an opinion the Stones more than shared about Keys. He first recorded with the Stones in the late 1960s, and toured and recorded with them off and on over the following decades. While it was Keys' sax playing that had made him famous, he would soon become infamous for his nights of boozing and drug-taking. Despite being a close friend of the Stones, he was allegedly banned from touring with the group for 10 years in 1973 after filling a bathtub full of Dom Perignon champagne, going for a dip, and then failing to make a show. Around the same time he also sought help for his heroin addiction, which, according to his autobiography, he picked up after touring with Jagger. Keys was not a full-time member of the Stones but frequently . led the horn section when the band went into the studio or on . the road. Keys split with the band in 1973 after becoming addicted to heroin, but managed to clean himself up before playing with the group again (pictured left alongside Ron Wood) Keys wrote about his wild lifestyle, including taking heroin with Keith Richards and filling a bath with champagne, in his autobiography Every Night's A Saturday Night (pictured left signing a copy for a fan) He also helped the band work on seminal albums such as 'Let It Bleed,' 'Sticky Fingers,' 'Exile on Main St.' and 'Goats Head Soup.' During the making of Exile on Main Street, Keys was also open about his drug and alcohol use, once saying: 'Hell, yeah, there was some pot around, there was some whiskey bottles around, there was scantily clad women. Hell, it was rock'n'roll!' Keith Richards also paid tribute today, saying: 'I have lost the largest pal in the world and I can't express the sense of sadness I feel, although Bobby would tell me to cheer up.'","Bobby Keys began playing for Buddy Holly while he was just 15 years old .

"Fans of one of Brazil's biggest football teams will be able to show their allegiance for all eternity after the club confirmed plans to open a dedicated cemetery for their supporters. Sao Paulo-based club Corinthians say up to 70,000 plots will be made available for fans in the 'Corinthians Forever' graveyard which is due to open in 2015. The vast complex will also become the final resting place of legendary players as the club announced  the remains of up to 100 recognised figures from Corinthians history will be moved there. For whom the final whistle tolls: Fanatical Corinthians fans can now choose to be buried alongside club legends at the team's official graveyard . Plots will cost between $1,870 (£1,169) and $3,240 (£2,027) depending on the area of the complex selected and proximity to club idols who will also be laid to rest at the site. Corinthians, or Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, are one of the most famous names in Brazilian football, winning five national titles in their 104-year history, one Copa Libertadores and two FIFA Club World Cups. Taking their name from the famous amateur side Corinthian, they were founded in 1910 after the English side blitzed all before them on a tour of Brazil. Idols: Late club legends Teleco, left, and Socrates, right. It is not known whether they will be among the 100 figures from Corinthians history to be moved to the new graveyard . The club, which is historically left-wing due to its founding by immigrant labourers, has had its fair share of legends plying their trade at the 40,000 Pacaembu Stadium. Most notable was Socrates. The Brazilian captain from the magical national side of 1982 was in his pomp for Corinthians between 1978 and 1984. He passed away in 2011. The Doctor was inspirational on and off the pitch, where he would often wear a shirt printed with 'Democracia' in protest at the military government running the country at the time. Before him there was Roberto Rivelino, famed for taking trickery to a new level and having a powerful left foot. The Sao Paulo-based club say up to 70,000 plots will be made available for fans in the 'Corinthians Forever' graveyard, which is due to open in 2015 . The attacking midfielder was christened 'King of the Park' by fans after coming through the youth ranks in 1965 and featuring for the next nine years. He infamously played in the shock state final defeat to Palmeiras in 1974 in what turned out to be last game. The fans made him a scapegoat and never forgave him, accusing him of bringing bad luck in an era where the club went without a state trophy between 1954 and 1977. The cemetery will also include function rooms, landscaped gardens, a restaurant and a lake and nature reserve, said Ricardo Polito, chief executive of the company in charge of the construction.","Corinthians set to open 'Corinthians Forever' graveyard in 2015 .

"Teenage boys are often stereotyped as the typical computer game players, but new research suggests that girls might actually be better at making the games in the first place. Computer scientists from have found that girls asked to create a computer game tend to write more complex programs than boys do. The girls also learned more about coding as they were writing the games. Girls were found to write more sophisticated games and use more event triggers than boys did in the study . The findings from the University of Sussex come amid concerns that too few computer science graduates are female. In the UK just 17 per cent of those to graduate in the UK with a computer science degree were women. Researchers believe that despite being more gifted programmers, many teenage girls are put off computers by the portrayal of programmers as nerdy boys on television and film. Dr Judith Good, from the school of engineering and informatics at the University of Sussex, said it may be possible to find new ways of motivating girls to take part in the subject. Teenage boys are often stereotyped as the typical computer game players, but new research suggests that girls might actually be better at making the games in the first place . She said: 'Given that girls’ attainment in literacy is higher than boys across all stages of the primary and secondary school curriculum, it may be that explicitly tying programming to an activity that they tend to do well in leads to a commensurate gain in their programming skills. 'In other words, if girls’ stories are typically more complex and well developed, then when creating stories in games, their stories will also require more sophisticated program in order for their games to work.' In the study, which is to be published in the journal Computers & Education, pupils aged between 12 and 13 years old spent eight weeks creating their own three dimensional role playing games. Boys can develop a rather unhealthy relationship with their games console, choosing to spend more time with it than they do in the real world in some cases . These were built on simple computer code, called scripts, that describe what happens if a particular situation arises. The researchers developed a new programming language called Flip, which allows users to create scripts by connecting graphical blocks together. Different events were used by pupils to trigger their scripts, such as when a character is killed in the game. The girls tended to use seven different triggers, almost twice as many as the boys. They were much more successful at creating complex scripts. Boys nearly always chose to trigger their scripts on when a character says something, which is the first and easiest trigger to learn. Films  that portray computer programmers as geeky boys, like in the 1983 movie Wargames starring Matthew Broaderick and Ally Sheedy, are blamed for turning many girls off studying computer science at university . In the battle of the sexes, boys have always been thought to perform better in subjects like maths and science. But a review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys – and have been doing so for at least 100 years. Not only that, but the research claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. The differences are the biggest in language and the smallest in maths, but even in these subjects girls get better grades on average, researchers said. The degree of gender difference in grades increased from infant school, but decreased between secondary school and college. The research suggests stereotypes that portray computer gaming and programming as the preserve of young males are inaccurate and that girls are perhaps better suited to building the games. Indeed recent research in the US has shown that around half of America's 190 million gamers are now women. Dr Good added: 'Our results were encouraging from a gender perspective. 'A substantial body of research exists which focuses on finding ways to motivate girls to engage with programming but few directly compare relative performance across genders. 'In our study, we found that more girls created more scripts which were both more varied in terms of the range of actions they used, and more complex in terms of the computational constructs they contained. 'The fact that girls appear to be using more complex triggers is encouraging from a computational perspective. 'Furthermore, it suggests that girls are not relying solely on conversations to drive the plots of their stories, but are instead using events such as moving between areas or acquiring items as significant plot events.' Not many female faces: Most of the computer games fans who queue up to buy the latest releases like Destiny tend to be young men and teenage boys yet girls may be better at writing the games .","Study by Sussex University shows girls were better at programming .

"With its long body, sharp teeth and fur these images show what looks like a monster out of a horror movie. And at first people were left baffled by the skeleton of the unknown animal, which was found by soldiers washed up on a Russian beach. The discovery prompted the Russian special forces to remove the carcass to carry out an in-depth study on the 'unknown' skeleton. Scroll down for video . The creature, which was found washed up on a beach on Sakhalin island in the most eastern part of Russia by soldiers . The remains appeared to show the animal once had a large mouth and sharp teeth, similar to that of a crocodile or alligator . The soldiers who discovered the bones snapped pictures of the unknown creature before it was taken away by Russian special forces . But despite the theories that it could have been the remains of a pre-historic creature, it turned out the bones were in fact from a large beluga whale. The remains were discovered on the shoreline in Sakhalin, an island in the most eastern part of Russia, which is near to Japan. The images of the skeleton, which first emerged in 2006, were snapped by the soldiers before it was removed from the beach by Russian special forces. But initial tests on the bones and teeth showed that it was not a fish, while the skeleton showed that it wasn't a crocodile or alligator. It was also said to have measured in at around 20 feet long and had skin, with hair and fur. But after being examined by marine experts, it transpired that the skeleton was that of a beluga whale . The large fossil measured in at around seven metres long and had skin, with hair and fur . Theories on what the animal might be had ranged from a whale to a plesiosaur, a marine creature from the triassic period, before it was established it was a beluga whale . But after several marine experts took one look at the pictures of the skeleton's skull, they quickly established that it was a beluga whale. They also released the picture of a whale's skull to show the similarity of the two sets of bones. Before being shown to be beluga whale, theories on what the remains could be had ranged for a whale to a plesiosaur, a pre-historic marine creature from the triassic period. Last year the remains of a similar-looking creature with a four-metre long body and horns, washed up in Villaricos, Spain. An unfortunate swimmer stumbled across the head before coming across the rest of the body.

"Futuristic planes based on spaceships which could allow passengers to travel from London to Sydney in two and a half hours are being developed. Virgin Galactic, the space flight company owned by Sir Richard Branson, says that the space tourism plane it is currently developing could be modified and turned into a super jet. The Concorde-like aircraft would travel outside of the Earth's atmosphere and enter orbit, using gravitational forces to travel at incredibly fast speeds. Scroll down for videos . The Virgin Galactic ship SS2, seen here on a test flight in the Mojave desert, might one day be modified to allow high speed orbital travel from country to country . Virgin Galactic have so far succeeded in getting the craft outside the stratosphere, the second lowest layer of the atmosphere . After detaching from its carrier plane SS2 ignites a powerful rocket which launches it into space . Passing above the planet at around 4,200mph it could cover the 10,500 miles from London to Sydney in two and a half hours. Among the company's other long-term goals are space cruise ships which could take people away from Earth for longer stretches. Speaking at an event in London yesterday, commercial director Stephen Attenborough said they could serve as orbital hotels, or allow tourists to travel to the Moon and back. Force India co-owner Michiel Mol and Dutch airline KLM have also teamed up to produce a similar jet which could begin flying next year. Tickets will initially cost £60,000 but the pair say commercial space flight could be available within 15-20 years. The spaceship is flown into the air while strapped into the carrying craft White Knight before detaching itself to launch into space . The company says the first space tourism flight, taken by Richard Branson and his family, will take place next year . Mol's first generation spaceship, the XCOR Aerospace Lynx, will travel at 2,200 mph and he predicts it will be capable of flying four times day and doing 5,000 flights with one engine. So far Virgin's SS2 aircraft has only managed to exit the stratosphere, the second lowest part of Earth's atmosphere, though the company says it will launch its first flight next year. Its manned spacecraft became the highest commercial winged vehicle to ever fly and used its shuttlecock-inspired 'feather system' to safely re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The company has already collected $80million (£50m) in deposits from 640 wealthy individuals interested in being among the first into space. The Xerus was the model superseded by the Lynx, a similar aircraft which the Force India boss hopes will provide two-hour London to Sydney trips by 2014 . However they will have to queue behind Sir Richard himself as he and his family are due to take the first trip. The flight took place over the Mojave desert and was piloted by Mark Stucky and Clint Nichols and lasted approximately an hour. Branson has also launched a TV competition show aimed at rewarding one winner with a ticket on board one of the SS2 craft. By launching its craft into orbit, . Virgin Galactic will be able to harness the power of gravity to travel . at extremely high speeds. When . objects enter orbit they are actually falling towards Earth, but the . fact that they are travelling so fast means they don't re-enter the . atmosphere. Craft can reach such high speeds because space is a vacuum, meaning there is no air resistance to slow them down. The . Virgin plane would essentially 'surf' along in orbit for a short time . before using special tail flaps to force itself back down to land.

"Singer Jill Scott has come in for flak from her fans after repeatedly tweeting her support for Bill Cosby after a series of rape allegations made against him resurfaced in recent weeks. Earlier this year the Philadelphia-born singer received an honorary doctorate from Temple University and was photographed receiving it from Cosby. The comedian resigned from the university’s board of trustees on Tuesday after several weeks of old accusations resurfacing. Singer Jill Scott has come in for flak from her fans after repeatedly tweeting her support for Bill Cosby after a series of rape allegations made against him resurfaced in recent weeks . Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby - but she instead tweeted her support for the comedian . Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby. Instead of supporting the cause, Scott tweeted her support for the 77-year-old comedian and actor. ‘So they've proven the alleged allegations? I didn't know. Will they also be giving him back the millions he's donated?’ she tweeted. The singer soon started receiving a number of tweets from followers expressing their disappointment and even anger with her stance. ‘Disappointed in Jill. Did u need an indictment to believe mike Browns family?,' tweeted one fan. On November 30, another follower tweeted that Scott wasn’t respecting her platform as an influential performer regarding her tweets in support of Cosby. The Philadelphia-born singer received an honorary doctorate from Temple University in May and was photographed receiving it from Cosby . Scott has repeatedly stood by her support for Cosby in discussions on Twitter with followers who have taken her to task . 'It’s hearsay in a court of law. Tis all. Trust. If this is true, he’ll face his due just like everyone,' she said in one tweet. 'For a world traveled, educated, woman AND mother to take up for a man who has abused women in his past is disheartening,' hit back one person . Scott then posted another tweet saying, 'I’m respecting a man who has done more for the image of Brown people that almost anyone EVER. From Fat Albert to the Huxtables.' The singer continued to defend Cosby as recently as yesterday whens he accused the media and society of 'attempting to destroy his magnificent legacy'. After multiple Twitter exchanges defending Cosby, Scott tweeted about rape calling it a cowardly crime and advising her followers to 'GET EVIDENCE' if raped. 'Rape is a despicable, cowardly crime. If you’ve been raped- plz do NOT shower, go to police IMMEDIATELY, have a rap (sic) kit done. GET EVIDENCE.' On Monday Scott accused the media and society of attempting to destroy Cosby's 'magnificent legacy' Tears: Dickinson, 59, broke down during the CNN interview, where she said Cosby had given her a pill which made her black out, and that she woke up after he raped her . On CNN on Monday night, Janice Dickinson described in graphic detail how Bill Cosby allegedly drugged then raped her in a Lake Tahoe hotel room more than 30 years ago. The former supermodel, 59, broke down in tears during the live television interview and accused Cosby of using the offer of career advancement to lure her to a hotel room where he drugged her and raped her while she was unconscious. Dickinson said she recalled waking up in extreme pain with Cosby's semen staining her clothes, after which she fled. Cosby's resignation from Temple was also announced on Monday, he had been a trustee since 1982 and was a frequent visitor, commencement speaker and attendee at basketball games. In the statement, first obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Cosby said: 'I have always been proud of my association with Temple University. Speech: The 77-year-old comedian and actor, who had been a trustee since 1982, was a frequent visitor, commencement speaker (pictured) and attendee at basketball games at the Philadelphia-based institution . 'I have always wanted to do what would be in the best interests of the university and its students. As a result, I have tendered my resignation from the Temple University Board of Trustees.' Patrick O’Connor, chairman of the board of trustees, said that Cosby does not want to be a distraction to his colleagues. He added that the board 'accepts Dr. Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university'. The resignation is believed to be effective immediately. Mr O'Connor had defended Cosby in a 2005 civil suit filed by a former Temple basketball employee, who accused the star of molesting her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion a year earlier. Cosby, who has been with his wife Camille for the last 51 years, and the woman later settled for undisclosed terms. But since the lawsuit was filed, at least 17 other alleged victims have come forward to claim that the star drugged and sexually abused them in decades past. Chatting: Cosby is pictured stopping to talk with a Temple cheerleader as he makes his way to the sidelines . The comedian has strongly denied any wrongdoing and has never been criminally charged. His lawyer has previously called the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited'. Cosby's decision to resign from the board of trustees reportedly follows a series of high-level talks by university leaders, many of whom had spoken in support of the Temple graduate. It also follows many other universities' decisions to sever ties with the star, who has donated millions of dollars to numerous academic institutions, and has close links to many others. The University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Cosby got his graduate degrees, recently said it had asked him to step down as honorary co-chairman of its $300 million fundraising campaign. And the Berklee College of Music will reportedly no longer award a scholarship in his name. At Temple, an online petition urging the university to cut ties with Cosby had garnered more than 1,000 signatures by Monday afternoon.","The singer has come in for flak from her fans after repeatedly tweeting her support for Bill Cosby over the past week .

"The dancer girlfriend of NSA leaker Edward Snowden was left on her own - without even any money to support herself - her father says. Jonathan Mills said daughter Lindsay Mills was devastated by Mr Snowden's abandonment and is still trying to piece her life back together. The concerned father recently told the Guardian his daughter, 28, was 'left to fend for herself' by Mr Snowden and 'trying to make sense of everything and come up with a plan for herself.' Forgiven: Jonathan Mills, the father of the NSA leaker's girlfriend Lindsay Mills, says his daughter was left penniless and to 'fend for herself' heartbroken: Mr Mills said his daughter is still trying to make sense of all that has happened . Stunning: Lindsay Mills, 28, took to her blog on Monday to detail her heartbreak over being suddenly left by Mr Snowden . Jonathan Mills said Lindsay had not spoken to the wanted man since he left and that neither he nor his daughter had anything to do with his series of NSA spy program leaks. 'He said I'm just going on a trip for business for a couple of weeks and I'll be coming back. She heard what had happened on the news,' the father recalled. 'She was basically left to fend for herself.' The polar opposites had dated for five years after meeting through an online dating site, he added. They were planning a future together. 'Up until she heard that he was in Hong Kong she was in the back of her mind planning marriage and a life together,' said Jonathan Mills. He further described the differences between the two. Lindsay is 'very artistic, free spirit and open - the opposite of me and Mr Snowden.' Jonathan Mills said in a previous interview that he has already forgiven Mr Snowden for . putting his family through hell - even though his daughter faced arrest . and a possible prison sentence in the plot's early days. She had previously written on her blog about how she was ‘adrift’ at losing Mr Snowden, who she described as her ‘mystery man’. He is currently living in Russia after being granted asylum by president Vladimir Putin. Family members have said in the past that Lindsay was with friends on the West Coast, though she could still be in Hawaii. Tiny dancer: Lindsay Mills has posted numerous photos and videos on her personal blog of herself pole dancing . Devastated: 'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass,' Lindsay Mills writes about being suddenly left by her 'mystery man' Jonathan said in the previous interview: 'I've met Ed. He's very nice, shy reserved. They've been dating four or five years.’ Asked if he was surprised at what Snowden did, he added 'it wasn't out of character. He's always had strong convictions of right and wrong so it kind of makes sense, but it was a shock.' He was not even angry that he was being put in this position, saying ‘alright, I understand.' He said that he did not know if his own views or those of his daughter - who dislikes the surveillance state - had any influence on Snowden. Earlier, a blonde woman in her 50s thought to be Jonathan’s girlfriend went into his house and claimed to be the best friend of Lindsay’s’ mother Martha. She said: ‘He (Jonathan) has nothing to do with it and she (Lindsay) has nothing to do with it’. Keeping a secret: Snowden says he never told his girlfriend about his life-altering plans, saying he left weeks ago saying only that he had to travel for business . Since Mr Snowden leaked the data, he has effectively brought an end to any future he hoped to have with his girlfriend. The pair seemed blissfully happy even though they appear to be totally different people. She is an extrovert who enjoys walking around naked whenever she can, spends her Sunday evenings in circus classes and surrounds herself with bohemian eccentrics. The title of her blog reads: ‘Adventures of a world-traveling, pole-dancing super hero.' Mr Snowden, by contrast, is a shy computer geek from a suburban family who likes to spend Sundays at football games and needed to be coaxed out of his shell to even do karaoke. In the days after the scandal broke, she took to her blog - where she has posted dozens of photos of herself semi-naked  - to tell of her heartbreak. 'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass,' she wrote. 'As I type this on my tear-streaked keyboard I’m reflecting on all the faces that have graced my path. 'The ones I laughed with. The ones I’ve held. The one I’ve grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu. Better times: Lindsay Mills seen here with Ed Snowden before he suddenly took off for Hong Kong after leaking confidential information . ‘But sometimes life doesn’t afford proper goodbyes.' It was an awful turn of events for Ms Mills, who had lived with Mr Snowden since at least 2009 when they were in Japan together. In 2012, he whisked her 8,000 miles from their home south of Baltimore, Maryland to Hong Kong where family friends thought they got married because it was a 'special place' for them. The NSA leaker curiously fled to a luxury hotel Hong Kong just as the revelations were beginning to be made public, after he decided to release the secret documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. He never told his heartbroken girlfriend about his plan - saying only that he needed to leave for a few weeks and offering a vague explanation. When he revealed his identity in the Guardian he said he expected he might never see his family again. Add Ms Mills to that list of people.","Jonathan Mills, father of Edward Snowden girlfriend Lindsay Mills, said the NSA leaker left his daughter 'to fend for herself'

"Motorists’ satisfaction with England’s potholed roads has plummeted to a record low. Fewer than one in three drivers say they are happy with the state of the roads - the lowest level since surveys began in 2008 - and the government’s poor record on repairs is to blame for the abysmal ratings, a damning report by MP watchdogs concludes today. It condemns as ‘ludicrous’ the Department for Transport’s patch-and-mend ‘piecemeal’ funding. They say this is making it difficult to maintain England’s road network cost-effectively and is leaving millions of drivers frustrated. The government’s poor record on repairs is to blame for the abysmal driver satisfaction ratings. File picture . Compensation pay-outs for damages caused by poor road conditions cost £31.6million last year alone. They condemned the decades of ‘unpredictable and fluctuating budgets’ for road maintenance and said ministers should realise that with potholes costing £52 to fill in – rising to £70 in London - ‘prevention is better than cure’. But they also attack local councils and the Highways Agency for not even knowing where their drains are. The AA said motorists were paying the price of such ignorance with ‘pools, ponds and puddles that blight UK roads’ because of poor drainage maintenance by highways authorities. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge blasted the Department for Transport . The powerful House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says the Department for Transport (DfT) had slashed the roads maintenance budget, only to have to make repeated emergency injections of cash to deal with fall-out from floods and other problems. The report says that since maintenance budgets were cut by £1.2billion over four years from April 2011, the committee said the DfT has had to provide extra funding on nine occasions, totalling £1.1billion. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘The department’s piecemeal and stop-go approach to funding for road maintenance in recent decades has made it difficult for highways authorities to maintain roads cost-effectively. ‘There has been too much reactive work in response to flooding and other events and not enough focus on preventative work that is less expensive in the long term.’ She said: ‘Public satisfaction with the condition of our roads is at the lowest level since the surveying of this began in 2008. ‘In the last survey only 30 per cent of the public were satisfied with the condition of the roads and the speed and quality of repairs.’ Mrs Hodge said: ‘The Department’s unpredictable and fluctuating budgets for road maintenance over decades have put value for money at risk. ‘It seems ludicrous that in 2010 the Department cut road maintenance budgets by £1.2billion over the four years from April 2011, but then it has intermittently given £1.1billion additional funding on nine separate occasions for various reasons, including in response to flooding or winter damage to the roads.’ The greatest problems are in London and the South East, according to the Department for Transport. Mrs Hodge said: ‘The Department must see that prevention is better than cure. It costs £52 to fill in a pothole, or £70 in London, yet it costs over £30million to pay and process compensation claims from road users for damages arising from poor road conditions.’ MPs cited experts at Infrastructure UK who say savings of up to 20 per cent are achievable when there is ‘certainty of funding.’ The Highways Agency, which is an executive agency of the Department, is responsible for maintaining the strategic road network. File pictures . Mrs Hodge said: ‘Whilst we understand the unpredictable nature of winter weather, too much road maintenance is inefficient because it is reactive and unplanned. ‘Concentrating activity in the winter months is inefficient and costly. Some local highway authorities are far too reactive to events, rather than anticipating, predicting and preventing disrepair.’ She noted: ‘Better information, better planning of funding and a pro-active stance on maintenance are what the Department must promote to have a chance of pleasing unhappy road users.’ The Public Accounts Committee report says the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency are making some progress in improving the way in which road maintenance is carried out ‘but more needs to be done.’ It notes: ‘Public satisfaction with the condition of our roads is at the lowest level since the survey assessing confidence began.’ The Highways Agency, which is an executive agency of the Department, is responsible for maintaining the strategic road network spanning 4,400 miles including almost all of England’s motorways and its most important ‘A’ roads. The remaining 183,000 miles of local roads are maintained by 152 local highway authorities. Public spending on maintaining England’s roads in 2012-13 was £4billion. Astonished that the Agency holds no information on 70per cent of its drainage systems, it said: ‘A good understanding of the state of the roads is absolutely essential for planning cost-effective preventative maintenance’. AA president Edmund King said its own surveys showed that while its members are relatively satisfied with the state of motorways and trunk roads, one in five say local roads are ‘terrible’. He said: ‘The Public Accounts Committee reflects this public anger.’ ‘It puts pressure on central government to work more closely with local government to carry out the basics. Effective and regular road maintenance that gives the taxpayer value for money and does the job.’ He added: ‘Central government’s stop-start funding over many years has simply patched up the UK’s roads.’ Lack of ring-fencing of local authority funds for road maintenance has added to this ‘sorry state’.","Fewer than one in three drivers happy with the state of UK roads .

"[digg] . Prosecutors in Texas have dropped a 2011 drunken driving citation against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. heiress Alice Walton. The highway patrol officer who pulled over Walton, 63, has been suspended and won't be available to testify, officials said yesterday. Parker County, Texas, Prosecutor John Forest told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that his office had two years to pursue the case against Walton. But the trooper's suspension won't be over by the Oct. 7 deadline. Prosecutors in Texas have dropped a 2011 drunken driving citation against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. heiress Alice Walton (pictured in Arkansas in 2011) Forrest said the trooper is on paid leave. The suspension for alleged misconduct began in February. Walton's attorney, Dee Kelly of Fort Worth, says the matter has been resolved without a formal charge being filed. The arrest came about a month before the opening of the Walton-backed Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville. Alice Walton's mugshot after the 2011 arrest in Texas . Walton was arrested on her 62nd birthday when was stopped at an Intestate in Parker County Texas for a traffic violation. Texas Highway patrol Trooper Gary Rozzell said at the time: 'Through an investigation at the scene, Walton was determined to be intoxicated during a field sobriety test.' He also said she refused a breath test, according to the Weatherford Democrat. She was booked and released on $1,000 bond. A statement from a family spokesman said: 'Ms Walton was pulled over by a patrolman with the Department of Public . Safety for driving 71 mph in an unattended 55 mph construction zone. 'She was returning home from a birthday dinner with friends at a Fort . Worth restaurant. She accepts full responsibility for this unfortunate . incident and deeply regrets it.' The DUI arrest was not Walton’s first. According to information from the . Springdale District Court in Arkansas, Walton was convicted of driving . under the influence in a 1998 case.According to the UK's Independent, she hit a gas meter and told the responding police officer: 'I'm Alice Walton, bitch!' She paid a several hundred dollar fine in that case, according to other news reports and served no jail time. No previous conviction showed up on her . criminal history so Walton was charged Friday with a first offence DWI, . according to Rozzell. Alice Walton, Jim Walton (left) and Rob Walton (right), chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., speak at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in June 2012 . Previous news accounts state Walton was . also involved in a 1989 wreck in Arkansas that resulted in the death of a . 50-year-old woman. No charges were filed at that time. In October 2012 Walton was worth about $27 billion, making her the second-richest American woman, tenth-richest American and 14th richest person in the world. Walton purchased her first piece of art when she was about ten years old and this interest led to her spearheading the Walton Family Foundation's involvement in developing Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. She has spent over $300million building an American art museum in Arkansas, and the facilities alone cost over $100mllion.","Highway patrol officer who pulled her over in 2011 has been suspended and can't testify .

"The Army has done it, as has the airforce. And now the Royal Navy has arrived in London to show off the weapons it hopes it never has to use at the London Olympics. HMS Ocean - the largest in the Navy - slipped up the Thames on Friday, past the tidal barriers, and up towards Greenwich to check out the berth, where it will monitor and protect London during the Olympics this summer. The hardest part of the journey was slipping past . the Thames barrier, which at only 60m gave some clearance on each side - . but not much in terms of margin for error. Scroll down for video . Welcome to London: The UK's largest warship HMS Ocean nudges its way through the Thames Barrier bzck in May on the way to docking at Greenwich . The Carrier HMS Ocean takes up her position in the Thames during security rehearsals for the Olympics back in May . Test run: The exercise is aimed at testing military capabilities to ensure operational readiness before the start of the Olympic Games . The show of strength came as Defence . Secretary Philip Hammond said today he was prepared to to give the order . to shoot down a hijacked airliner if the Olympics were threatened by a . 9/11-style attack. Hammond told the . Evening Standard: 'The decision to engage would be made at the highest . levels of government.' Asked if he was personally willing to . give the order to destroy a rogue aircraft, he . said: 'Of course ... I’m certainly prepared to make decisions.' Mr Hammond added that Londoners  and visitors 'should be . reassured by the military presence - there is no risk from the . equipment. It’s defensive in nature and pointing skywards.' The amphibious assault ship is being positioned in Greenwich to provide extra security for the London Olympics . HMS Ocean was commissioned in September 1998 at her home port Devonport, Plymouth, after being built by Kvaerner Govan Ltd on the Clyde and fitted out by VSEL at Barrow-in-Furness. She is the sole member of her class in the Royal Navy, designed to support amphibious landing operations and to support the staff of Commander UK Amphibious Force and Commander UK Landing Force. The ship carries a crew of 255, an aircrew of 206 and 480 Royal . Marine Commandos. An additional 320 marines could be accommodated in a . short-term emergency. HMS Ocean is capable of transporting and . sustaining an embarked military force of up to 800 people equipped with . artillery, vehicles and stores. She has capacity for 40 . vehicles but is not designed to land heavy tanks. There are four LCVP . Mk5 vehicle/personnel landing craft on davits. The ship has full facilities for 12 EH101 Merlin and six Lynx . helicopters, plus landing and refuelling facilities for Chinook . helicopters. Twenty Sea Harriers could be carried but not supported. The . flight deck is 170m long and 32.6m wide, with two aircraft lifts. Its weapon systems include four Oerlikon/BAE twin 30mm guns together with . three Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mk15 close-in weapon systems. Questioned how he would deal with a hijacked airliner full of passengers, . he said: 'We rehearse these things, we train for them. 'All the ministers involved are fully versed in the processes they have to go through, the judgments they have to make. 'I’m not going to spell out precisely . who is in the loop and who is not, but there are a number of ministers . who are involved in the air defence arrangements. The decision to engage . would be made at the highest levels of government.' Mr . Hammond, who was taken on board HMS Oceans by a landing craft, said of . the security arrangements: 'I don’t think it’s over the top. Every . Olympic Games in recent times has had a significant military component . to its security plan.' Arrangements for security has been ongoing for the last few days, with HMS Ocean now making its debut appearance. The ship will remain in Greenwich throughout the summer games. The warship, which has the motto . 'Boldly Faithfully Happily', will have quite an army on board - 300 . military personnel will base themselves on the ship, while eight Lynx . helicopters with sniper teams onboard will be ready to lift off at a . moment's notice. It is part of huge military . protection for the city, with Typhoon jets stationed at RAF Northolt, . and ground-to-air Rapier missiles dotted on rooftops at six sites across . the city. Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond . said: 'Whilst there is no specific threat to the Games, we have to be . ready to assist in delivering a safe and secure Olympics for all to . enjoy.' Rapier surface-to-air missiles have . also been showcased at Blackheath Army Cadet Centre, in south east . London, as part of the massive 2012 security test on land, sea and in . the air. Weymouth and Portland in Dorset will . play host to the sailing where the Albion-class amphibious assault . warship HMS Bulwark will play a key role in protecting the events. Colonel . Jon Campbell, commander of the Joint Ground Based Air Defence, said: . 'We have done as much as we can to allay people's fears. 'The . Rapier system has a world-class radar on it and is particularly good at . picking up low and slow-moving objects in the sky. It means we're able . to get the very best picture of what is happening in the skies of . London.' Air Vice Marshall . Stuart Atha added: 'We want the focus to be on Usain Bolt this summer . and not us. We're very proud to be part of this plan to deliver a safe . and secure Olympics.' The Lexington Building in Tower Hamlets . and the Fred Wigg Tower in Waltham Forest, both in east London, have . been identified as potential sites for the High Velocity Missiles. Members of the public watch as the HMS Ocean passes Greenwich Naval College . Rapier missiles would be positioned on Blackheath Common and in Oxleas Wood, both in south east London, and at William Girling Reservoir Chain in Enfield and Barn Hill at Netherhouse Farm in Epping Forest, both in north London, should the Air Security Plan be approved by the Government. Col Campbell said the sites had been chosen to avoid having weapons inside the Olympic Park. He said: 'We're trying to de-militarise . this and let the sport do the talking. The Lexington Building is the . best available location away from the Olympic Park.' Heading to England: The HMS Ocean earlier today, out at sea, making its way to the Thames . Ready and waiting: The Typhoon jets line up on the tarmac at RAF Northolt, west London, ahead of a nine-day military exercise to test security for the Olympic Games . What the...? A man walks past a Rapier short range air defence system at Blackheath, London, ahead of the exercises . We got your back: Surface-to-air missiles at the army cadet base in Blackheath, southeast London . The Rapier surface-to-air missile has the power to take down a Boeing 747 full of passengers if needed to protect a stadium full of 80,000 Olympic spectators in a terrorism nightmare scenario. The British military has insisted that the missiles - with a range of up to five miles - could be deployed as the last line of defence. Experts say the likelihood that they will be fired is slim to none. Downing an aircraft would still cause debris to rain from the sky, high casualties and fires. Ready to roll: Royal Marine commandos in rigid inflatables, from the Royal Navy flagship HMS Bulwark, take part in a security exercise off Weymouth and Portland . When you launch a Rapier missile and . shoot down an aircraft, it's not like the whole thing vanishes. It's 100 . tons of metal, scraps, and other stuff that is coming down,' said Jan . Wind, a retired Dutch Navy captain who is director of the Hague-based . Wiser Consultancy. 'If a Rapier is used, the damage . could be just about the same as the intentions of the terrorist - only . on another spot. The goal of the terrorists will be met in a certain . sense,' Wind said. It's rare for the British military to . publicise the location of its weapons, but the military says it hopes . that any potential attacks will be deterred by showing the missile . strength and other defense assets such as Typhoon fighter jets. Ground-to-air missiles have been a . fixture of Olympic games and large VIP events in the post-9/11 world, . but London's missiles have sparked outrage among residents of an . apartment block who learned that the Rapiers might be stationed on their . roof. They say the missiles are creating a . climate of fear - which security experts say is exactly the point. That's because the systems are more valuable as deterrents than as . deployed weapons, Mr Wind said. 'The British army and air force don't . do all this to really shoot down a terrorist aircraft, they do it to . display their determination to do so, which will hopefully prevent the . terrorists from attacking,' Mr Wind said. 'If you know that there are 500 policeman outside the jewellery store, you will not go there and try to rob the store.' The Ministry of Defence it has not decided where it will ultimately station the missile batteries.","HMS Ocean sails up the Thames as preparations for Olympic security continues .

"Militant union chiefs were humiliated yesterday as they called off strike plans after admitting their threat to the start of the Olympics had prompted ‘abuse and vitriol’. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, insisted he had ‘no regrets’ about plotting the strike, which had been planned to cause chaos on Britain’s borders today. The climbdown came hours after ministers revealed that more than enough border staff had volunteered to work to ensure Heathrow, which is expecting its busiest ever day as thousands arrive for the Games, operated as normal. Scroll down for video . Axed: PCS action that would have led to huge queues at airport immigration tomorrow has been cancelled . Other union leaders and Labour leader . Ed Miliband were also understood to have been dismayed that the PCS had . so badly misjudged the public mood by seeking to disrupt the Olympics. Mr Serwotka sought to save face by . claiming the Home Office had agreed to create an extra 1,100 jobs, 800 . at the UK Border Force and 300 at the Passport Office. But ministers said no posts were being . created in response to his strike threat, and they had been planned for . some time to plug vacancies. It also emerged that only 400 are being . recruited at the Border Force. The 800 figure came about because of an . administrative error in two job adverts. Fury: Home Secretary Theresa May wrote an open letter to border staff urging them to defy the walkout and 'do what their country needs' before the deal was done . Deal: PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka claims the deal shows the Government admits to making too many cuts to staff . Damian Green, the immigration . minister, said: ‘No concessions have been made by the Government. Posts . are being advertised to fill gaps left by normal staff turnover. ‘We are pleased that the PCS . leadership has seen sense and called off this irresponsible strike which . was not supported by the majority of members. ‘During the past week, our staff have shown fantastic dedication and commitment during an extremely busy period. ‘Queues at Heathrow have been almost . non-existent and athletes and visitors from around the world have . received a welcome of which the country can be proud.’ Mr Serwotka admitted the strike had . triggered a backlash, with critics warning it would bring shame on . Britain with the eyes of the world on this country. He said: ‘We have been subjected to . the most extraordinary level of vitriol and abuse in the last week . [since the strike date was announced]. The abuse directed at front-line . public sector staff is completely and utterly unwarranted.’ Mr Serwotka said it was absurd to have . paid hundreds of workers to leave under the Government’s austerity . cuts, only to take more on. Work-to-rule:  London Underground workers have been instructed to do no more than the minimum required in their contracts from Friday .

"Hundreds of food outlets at Olympic venues have been forced to take chips off the menu, because of . Hundreds of food outlets at Olympic venues have been forced to take chips off the menu, because of a demand from sponsor McDonald's. Olympic chiefs have banned all 800 food retailers at the 40 Games venues across Britain from dishing up chips because of 'sponsorship obligations.' The only loophole in the agreement, announced in a memo to staff, is that chips can be served with fish - safeguarding Britain's most famous dish. But is seems the bosses have predicted an outrage about the decision, . emphasising that the move was not backed by the food retailers. The memo reads: 'Due to sponsorship obligations with . McDonalds, Locog have instructed the catering team they are no longer . allowed to serve chips on their own anywhere within the Olympic park. 'The only loophole to this is if it is served with fish.' 'Please understand . this is not the decision of the staff serving up your meals, who given . the choice would gladly give it you however they are not allowed to. 'This is being escalated through to the directors of L2012C and Locog and the IOC. 'Please do not give the staff grief; this will only lead to us removing fish and chips completely. 'Everyone has a right to work in a none abusive environment.' Commercial partners Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Cadbury, Nature Valley and Heineken will be the only branded products sold at the games. The 800 food outlets will serve a mixture of international dishes and great British dishes, with the organising committee . boasting that food outlets would 'celebrate the heritage and diversity of .

Visitors to the Olympic venues won't be able to tuck into British sausage and chips . Controversy already surrounded some of the sponsors of the Olympic Games, with organisers criticised for accepting deals with companies like McDonald's and Coca-Cola because they conflict with the 'Olympic ideal'. Jenny Jones, a Green Party assembly . member, said the Games have provided 'a glut of sponsored messages for high calorie . food and drink that are at odds with the Olympian athletic ideal.’ Last . month McDonald's revealed pictures of its biggest restaurant in the . world, newly build in London's Olympic Park where the strongest, fittest . and fastest athletes in the world will compete. The vast two-storey restaurant will serve up to 1,200 customers an hour and sell £3million of fast food during the Games. At 3,000 sq ft the building, next to the Olympic Stadium, is bigger than the current largest McDonald’s, in Moscow. The new McDonald's restaurant at the Olympic Park in Stratford will be the biggest in the world . During the Games it is expected to sell £3million pounds worth of fast-food . The Russian restaurant will regain its . title on September 9, however, when the London branch is bulldozed . after the Paralympics closing ceremony. Olympics sponsor Visa also came under fire from critics last month after effectively banning the use of rival cards at Games venues. It has ordered the closure of all cashpoints which accept Mastercard or American Express, and non-Visa customers will not even be able to use their cards to pay for goods at checkouts. The card giant, which has exclusive rights over the Games' payment system, will disable 27 LINK machines inside venues and replace them with just eight Visa-only cashpoints. Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, said at the time: '‘This is shocking. It is a privilege to . be a sponsor of the Olympics and they are abusing that privilege by . exploiting consumers.'

"Wearing a pristine white shirt and jeans, her hair swept up primly, the girlfriend of billionaire football club owner Roman Abramovich clearly wanted to project the image of a sophisticated art expert when she gave an interview to an upmarket fashion blog. But if that was her intention, it was fatally undermined by the fact that she was pictured sitting on a chair made from a lifelike mannequin of a scantily clad black woman lying on her back with her legs in the air. Worse, the pictures appeared online on Martin Luther King Day, on which millions of Americans commemorate the achievements of the man who did so much to promote black rights. After being accused of racism, socialite Dasha Zhukova has now been forced to apologise. The darling of the celebrity circuit — who owns her own art gallery in Moscow — insisted the artwork was, in fact, a protest against prejudice. This image of socialite Dasha Zhukova sitting on a chair made from a lifelike mannequin of a black woman lying on back with her legs in the was published on Martin Luther King Day. The chair is based on an earlier work by British artist Allen Jones in 1969 . The chair, designed by a Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard, was ‘an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics’, she claimed. Her somewhat self-serving explanation is not unlike that offered by the man on whose erotic furniture Melgaard based his chair. It was in 1969 that British artist Allen Jones, a friend and contemporary of David Hockney at the Royal College of Art, designed a set of sculptures — a hat-stand, table and chair — all incorporating fibreglass models of submissive women (although they were white, not black) in skimpy leather outfits. The sculptures were cast in fibreglass by a company that produced mannequins for shop windows at a cost of £1,500 each. Their leather clothing was made by the same firm that supplied the skin-tight cat-suits worn by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in the TV Series The Avengers. They caused a storm of protest when they were first exhibited in 1970. Feminists, not surprisingly, took great exception to the way they objectified women, turning them into nothing more than a piece of furniture, something on which men could hang their hats or put their pint glass. Fantasising about women as furniture is known to psychologists as forniphilia. The radical feminist magazine Spare Rib suggested Jones must be terrified of women and have a ‘castration complex’. When the sculptures were later exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, stink bombs and smoke bombs were thrown at them. The original: Allen Jones created 'Woman As An Armchair' in 1969. It was exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London and at the Tate . ‘There was an incredible furore on the Mall,’ Jones later recalled. The Guardian newspaper suggested he should be banned from exhibiting. ‘It was tough stuff and I wasn’t expecting it.’ Some years later, when ‘Woman As An Armchair’ was shown at the Tate, it was attacked with paint-stripper that shrivelled the skin on the mannequin’s face. It has since been restored. The attackers were never caught but as it took place on International Women’s Day, it was assumed feminists were behind it. Like Dasha Zukova, Jones claimed the art never set out to be offensive — and was protesting against sexism, not revelling in it. His principal aim, he says, was to be iconoclastic. With sculpture as an art form having gone out of fashion by the Sixties, Jones wanted to revive it, but by using industrial materials. ‘My idea was to offend canons of art at the time.’ Yet he has admitted being motivated by other, somewhat less lofty, impulses than artistic radicalism. Part of the inspiration came from the sight of scantily clad women walking round London in mini-skirts and hot-pants. Jones says: ‘I was living in Chelsea and I had an interest in the female figure and the sexual charge that comes from it. Every Saturday on the King’s Road you saw that skirts were shorter, the body was being displayed in some new way. The following week someone would up the ante.’ Six editions of three pieces of 'furniture' were produced and an entire set was bought by the German playboy Gunter Sachs . Those visions were to fuel his artistic . imagination, producing not only his women as furniture, but striking . images of seemingly endless legs wearing stilettoes. Born in Southampton and brought up in London, Jones moved to New York after being expelled from art college for ‘excessive independence’. During the Sixties, his work became more and more sexually explicit, until his friend David Hockney observed that one of his paintings looked like an illustration to a fetishist magazine. Jones, rather than feeling chastened, began collecting such magazines and his art became ever more focused on sex: women with whips, women in bondage wear, women with painted male genitalia superimposed across their torsos. But he became frustrated that the curves of his fantasy women could not be adequately expressed on a flat canvas. So he decided to turn to sculpture, using modern, industrial materials rather than traditional clay or metal. His wife, Janet posed happily for a magazine alongside the table and hat-stand, kneeling topless on a chair, wearing stockings and a corset, looking disturbingly like one of her husband’s sculptures. Artist Allen Jones, pictured aged 32 with part of the 'woman table' in 1969, claims the artworks were a protest against sexism . Although never as famous as his . contemporaries, Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein or Andy Warhol, Jones was at . the forefront of the British Pop Art movement. His furniture and the . furore it provoked acted as a career-boost, raising his public profile. It certainly brought him financial success. An entire set of the furniture — six editions of each set of three were produced — was snapped up by Gunter Sachs, the German playboy who was married to actress Brigitte Bardot. In 2012, Sachs’s art collection was auctioned at Sotheby’s, where the furniture set sold for £2.6 million, although Allen Jones received only £10,000 in royalties. Film-maker Stanley Kubrick was one of those very taken with the sculptures. Years earlier, he’d asked Jones to design some similar erotic ‘furniture’ for his film A Clockwork Orange, whose disturbing themes included violence against women. At first, Jones liked the idea but when it became clear Kubrick was expecting him to make the sculpture for free, he turned him down. Undeterred, Kubrick got a set designer to produce tables for the film, using models of completely naked women. One critic described the movie as ‘an intellectual’s pornographic film’. Mr Jones, pictured with one of his canvas creations in the 1960s, was asked to make furniture for Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange but turned him down . David Lee, art critic and editor of art magazine Jackdaw, doesn’t believe Jones’s claim that the sculptures were some kind of ironic pro-feminist commentary on women’s position in society. Instead, he suggests that the cynical Jones deliberately set out to create a storm, particularly among feminists, in order to get noticed. Nor does Lee believe the chair and its accompanying hat-stand and table can be seen as great art. Jones’s entire oeuvre is, he says, ‘fairly superficial, about t**s, legs and bondage. [It’s] based on half-naked Bond-girl types. It makes me feel uneasy and squeamish. It’s sleazy.’ Since his controversial heyday, Jones has become something of a grand old man of British art, organising exhibitions with David Hockney and bemoaning the failure to teach drawing properly. What does he make of the chair at the centre of the current controversy. Is he flattered by Melgaard’s ‘homage’ to his original? Far from it. He told a BBC interviewer he found it ‘rather tacky and distasteful. I can only imagine that he [Melgaard] was going to get a lot of publicity, which unfortunately it has, for the wrong reasons.’ Perhaps Melgaard was simply working on the principle that sex sells, and there’s no such thing as bad publicity. As Jones himself discovered, 45 years ago.

"The roots of Corydalis plants contain a substance that acts as a painkiller which is particularly effective for treating chronic, low-level pain. Image shows the flower of a Corydalis caseana plant . An ancient Chinese herbal remedy could be used to fight chronic pain, new research has revealed. The roots of the flowering plant Corydalis – a member of the poppy family - have been used for centuries as a pain reliever. Now scientists have found they contain a key pain-relieving ingredient known as dehydrocorybulbine (DHCB) and that they do not lose effectiveness over time like traditional opiate drugs. The chemical acts not through the morphine receptor but through other receptors, in particular one that binds dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain's reward and pleasure centres and also helps regulate movement and emotional responses. Olivier Civelli of the University of California, Irvine, said: ‘Our study reports the discovery of a new natural product that can relieve pain. ‘This analgesic acts in animal assays against the three types of pain that afflict humans, including acute, inflammatory, and neuropathic or chronic pain.’ He made the discovery as part of the ‘herbalome’ project, an effort to catalogue all of the chemical components of traditional Chinese medicine. The Corydalis plants that were the focus of the new study grow mainly in central eastern China, where underground tubers are harvested, ground, and boiled in hot vinegar. Those concoctions are often prescribed to treat pain, including headaches and back pain. The researchers went looking for compounds in Corydalis that appeared likely to act in a manner similar to morphine. Dr Civelli said: ‘We landed on DHCB but rapidly found that it acts not through the morphine receptor but through other receptors, in particular one that binds dopamine.’ The discovery adds to earlier evidence showing that the dopamine D2 receptor plays a role in pain sensation. The plant roots have been used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for hundreds of years - they are often used to treat headaches and back pain. Image shows farmers harvesting the roots in eastern China . While Corydalis extracts, or isolated . DHCB, work against all types of pain, they hold special promise for . those who suffer with persistent, low-level chronic pain. For one thing, DHCB doesn't appear to lose effectiveness with time in the way that traditional opiate drugs do. Dr Civelli said: ‘We have good pain medications for acute pain - codeine or morphine, for example. ‘We have pain medication for inflammatory pain, such as aspirin or acetaminophen. ‘We do not have good medications for chronic pain. DHCB may not be able to relieve strong chronic pain, but may be used for low-level chronic pain.’ He warned further testing for toxicity is needed before doctors should consider prescribing it to patients. The study was published in the journal Current Biology.","Corydalis plant roots contain the painkiller dehydrocorybulbine .

"Lady Gaga has revealed she was raped as a teenager. The 28-year-old singer admits she 'went through some horrific things' when she was 19 and relied on 'a lot of mental and physical therapy' to help her to heal. Talking on The Howard Stern Show, Gaga confirmed she was raped by a music producer 20 years her senior. Scroll down for video . As she was: Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta, on an MTV show back in 2005, when she would have been about 19 - it was around this time that she was attacked . When asked about the rape she initially said: 'I don't...I don't want to... Happy times! Let's talk about happy things!' But when the radio host pressed her on the issue, she said: 'I went through some horrific things that I'm able to laugh [at] now, because I've gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy and emotional therapy to heal over the years. 'My music's been wonderful for me. But, you know, I was a shell of my former self at one point. I was not myself. 'To be fair, I was about 19. I went to Catholic school and then all this crazy stuff happened, and I was going, ""Oh, is this just the way adults are?'...I was very naive.""' Opening up: Gaga is interviewed by Howard Stern . Listen to the full interview here. Asked if she had ever confronted the rapist, who was 20 years older than her, she said: 'I think it would terrify me. It would paralyse me. 'I saw him one time in a store and I was so paralysed by fear. Because it wasn't until I was a little bit older that I went, ""Wow, that was really messed up.""'# . The blonde beauty, who is dating actor Taylor Kinney, didn't tell anybody about the incident at the time, but eventually decided to seek help. She said: 'I don't know what I was thinking. I didn't tell anybody. 'And I didn't even tell myself for the longest time. And then I was like, ""You know what?

Attorney Mark Geragos tweeted, 'Guess who the rapist was?' And when a fan asked if it was Dr Luke, he responded '#bingo.' Lady Gaga's representative told TMZ, the allegations are 'absolutely not true' although refused to comment on the identity of the attacker. The spokesman later added: 'The Dr. Luke lawsuit is utterly incomprehensible. This simply isn't true and how dare someone take advantage of such a sensitive matter.' A representative for Dr Luke, real name Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, told the website: 'Mark Geragos' statement is completely false and defamatory. Luke met Lady Gaga twice for less than half an hour total in those two meetings combined. He has never been alone with her and never touched her. Neither meeting was in that time frame reported.' But Mr Geragos stood by his allegations, telling TMZ: 'I said it because it's true'. He mentioned the Bill Cosby allegations have 'now made others more courageous about coming out.' What's more, The attorney said he wants to depose Gaga in Kesha's sexual assault lawsuit against Dr Luke, also telling TMZ that three other women 'not as famous'  claim to have similar experiences to Kesha and will be deposed as well.

"Mikhail Gorbachev has accused America of firing up a new Cold War while Russian tanks rumble into Ukraine's eastern region amid a ceasefire deal between Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels . Mikhail Gorbachev has accused America of firing up a new Cold War and has called on 'avid militarists' to leave Europe - while Russian tanks rumble into Ukraine's eastern territory. The former Soviet leader spoke out as Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels agreed to a partial ceasefire in the civil war in the east of the country, which has claimed at least 4,300 lives. But despite the deal brokered, Ukraine yesterday said a military convoy of 106 vehicles including Howitzer tanks rolled into its Donetsk region from Russia without permission. Mr Gorbachev said there was still time to defuse the standoff between Moscow and the West as he and his western counterparts had done during the Perestroika period. 'Now there are once again signs of a Cold War,' he said in an interview with Tass, the state-owned Russian news agency. 'This process can and must be stopped. After all, we did it in the 1980s. We opted for de-escalation, for the reunification (of Germany). 'And back then it was a lot tougher than now. So we could do it again.' Mr Gorbachev did not refer to Ukraine directly but hinted at the conflict where the pro-EU government in Kiev is backed by the West while Moscow supports separatist rebels in the east. His comments came as Ukraine's military and separatist forces 'agreed in principle' to the new truce to bring 'a total ceasefire along the entire line of contact' in the Lugansk region. But differences remained on certain details, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OCSE) who negotiated the deal. The truce, which is set to begin on Friday, comes exactly three months after the much violated September 5 ceasefire to end the separatist rebellion which began in April in Luhansk and Donetsk.

But, following days of fierce fighting, the Ukrainian military's press service said they had agreed to a temporary ceasefire at the airport in rebel held Donetsk, after talks with Russian officials. 'Particular attention will be paid to the question of Donetsk airport as it is a strategic site,' the press service  said in a Facebook post. However, suspicions remain on both sides with Ukraine yesterday saying that the military convoy had entered its eastern territory from Russia. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko yesterday accused Moscow of using humanitarian aid shipments to smuggle weapons and ammunition.

In Shchastya, north of Lugansk, a Ukrainian soldier fires a missile with a man-portable air-defence system during exercises . 'Therefore they are able to increase the intensity (of attacks),' he said, adding that Russian special forces were bolstering the rebels in the area. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also said the organisation had seen 'a significant military buildup in and around Ukraine, adding that there have been, 'large transfers of Russian advanced weapons, equipment and military personnel to violent separatists.' More than 4,300 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine since separatist rebellions began following the ouster of former president Viktor Yanukovych after protests about his decision to abandon closer ties with the European Union. After his removal, the Crimean peninsula, overwhelmingly ethnic Russian, was annexed by Moscow in March and the following month separatist rebellions began in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. Ukraine wants the rebels to hand back the territory they have captured. Russia denies using humanitarian convoys to transport weapons and rejects Western and Ukrainian accusations that it is arming the rebels and sending fighters to aid them. Instead it the accuses the West and Kiev of pressing a campaign of indiscriminate violence in the eastern territories of Luhansk and Donetsk.","The former Soviet leader spoke as Howitzers rumble in from Russia .

"Just months after he was rumored to be getting back together with ex-mistress V. Stiviano, 80-year-old Donald Sterling has been spotted out with a new young woman. The former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who was forced to sell his team this summer amid a racism scandal, was pictured shopping in Beverley Hills on Monday with a mystery brunette wearing sunglasses to conceal her identity. Sterling made so much money selling his team to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for a record $2billion that he chose to buy an iPhone in person at an AT&T store, on a day when all the holiday deals were online for Cyber Monday. The pictures taken Monday show Sterling walking discreetly behind the unidentified woman, with coordinated all-black outfits. Scroll down for video . New flame?

Sterling and the woman appeared to be coordinating outfits, both wearing all black and sunglasses . The two were captured walking into an AT&T store where they stood side by side at the counter, talking to a sales associate together. Sterling is seen meandering around the store, before sitting down with an employee and taking out his card to make a purchase. He is then pictured leaving the store solo, clutching a brand new iPhone. The idea that Sterling may have moved on to a new young mistress is surprising considering there were rumors he had reunited with ex V Stiviano in August. Put it on the card: Sterling was seen perusing the store before sitting down with an employee and whipping out a card to make a purchase . Call me: A few minutes later, Sterling was seen leaving the store alone with a new iPhone in hand . His companion carried a blue smartphone and a Chanel purse . Stiviano is the reason the real estate mogul got into hot water last spring, when an audio conversation she recorded was 'leaked' and revealed Sterling to have prejudices against African Americans. Stiviano herself is both Latina and black. The scandal got Sterling booted from the league and eventually he was forced to sell his team this summer, with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stepping up to buy the team for $2billion. Sterling and Stiviano were last reported together in August, when Sterling's wife Shelly called 911 from vacation in France to say her husband's former mistress has sneaked into their California home to 'torment' him. When officers arrived on the scene, Sterling told them that Stiviano was his 'invited guest' and they left without making an arrest. No happy reunion? In August, Sterling was rumored to have reunited with ex V Stiviano (pictured together attending a Clippers game) after his wife called 911 to report that Stiviano had sneaked into their house . His other half: Sterling pictured above attending a Clippers game with wife Shelly. Shelly said she was filing for divorce this year, but the two still appear to be legally bound . The pictures of Sterling on Monday were taken as a judge ruled to drop charges against a New York man who attacked Stiviano this past summer. Dominick Diorio was charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly punching Stiviano in the face and calling her the n-word outside a Meatpacking District hotel on June 1. But a judge decided Monday that the charges against the 40-year-old will be dropped if he avoids rearrest for the next six months. Monday's decision was just the latest legal blow to Stiviano. Last month, a judge in California decided to throw out her defamation lawsuit against Shelly Sterling. Bad month for Stiviano: A judge decided to drop assault charges against a man who punched Stiviano outside a hotel in June. Stiviano is pictured partying in New York in a photo posted to Instagram in September . The lawsuit claimed that Sterling's wife falsely called her a thief and embezzler in hundreds, if not thousands, of media reports. The judge said Stiviano provided no evidence for her claim. That lawsuit was filed in the midst of another lawsuit from Shelly Sterling to reclaim $2.5million in gifts Stiviano had received from Donald Sterling during their relationship. Shelly, who is still married to Sterling despite the two appearing to be estranged, says Stiviano's  gifts were taken from community property that her husband had no right to give away. Those gifts include a $1.8million duplex, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. The trial over that lawsuit begins March 9.","The 80-year-old was seen shopping at an AT&T store on Monday with a much younger woman .

"Pharrell Williams said that 'everyone is heartbroken' there was no grand jury indictment of a white cop over the fatal shooting of a black, unarmed teenager Michael Brown, a week after the musician sparked a heated debate by calling the victim's behavior 'bully-ish'. The singer said in an interview late on Monday that his perspective on the case hasn't changed since the shooting in August. 'My feelings have been the same since that boy was murdered,' Williams said backstage at The Voice in Los Angeles, where he's a coach. 'Everyone is heartbroken. It's another teen, unarmed teen gunned down.' Scroll down for video . Pharrell Williams (pictured left on Monday) said he was 'heartbroken' over the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown - a week after sparking a heated debate when he said the cop shooting victim's behavior was 'bully-ish' before his death . The 'Happy' hitmaker has been among the most high-profile recording artists to weigh in on the death of 18-year-old Brown in Ferguson and the racially charged aftermath, in a recently published Ebony magazine interview and elsewhere. Before he was shot dead, Brown was caught on surveillance camera stealing a handful of cigarillos from a convenience store in Ferguson, Missouri, and intimidating the shop owner. While Pharrell said that there was no excuse for Officer Darren Wilson to use lethal force against the unarmed teen, he thinks Brown's actions were overlooked in the national discussion about the tragedy. 'It looked very bully-ish; that in itself I had a problem with,' Pharrell told Ebony magazine. 'Not with the kid, but with whatever happened in his life for him to arrive at a place where that behavior is OK. Why aren't we talking about that?' Williams went on: 'The boy was walking in the middle of the street when the police supposedly told him to 'get the f*** on the sidewalk.' If you don't listen to that, after just having pushed a storeowner, you're asking for trouble.' Williams declined to comment on Monday about ongoing protests including school walkouts across the country. Intimidating: Police released this surveillance camera footage, reportedly showing Michael Brown grabbing a convenience store owner shortly before he was stopped by Officer Darren Wilson and shot dead on August 9 . 'It's not really about what I think. It's about what you're going to do. What are you going to do? He's a teen who is gone,' Williams said. 'He was gunned down. What are you going to do? You understand what I'm saying? That's why it hurts. Because you have no answer. None of us do. He's gone. That hurts.' After the story was published in Ebony magazine, Twitter was flooded with comments calling out Pharrell's interview. One Twitter user said: 'Mike Brown was a bully says Pharrell Williams. So do we get a pass to shoot bullies in society? Way to go Pharrell.' This isn't the first time that singer has started controversy over his opinions on race issues. In an interview with Oprah last year, Pharrell angered some when he said 'the new black doesn't blame others races for our issues'. Pharrell seemed hesitant to talk about race in the interview with the African-American monthly magazine, saying: 'I don't talk about race since it takes a very open mind to hear my view, because my view is the sky view. But I'm very troubled by what happened in Ferguson, Missouri.' However, he felt the need to weigh in on the current situation in the predominantly-black St Louis suburb, believing 'the hangover from Ferguson is going to be a long one, worse than Trayvon Martin'. In the  interview with Ebony magazine, Pharrell said he was troubled that the man responsible for Brown's death, Officer Darren Wilson (pictured last week), will not face trial for the shooting . Trayvon Martin was another unarmed black 17-year-old who was shot dead two years ago near to where he lived in Sanford, Florida, by a man who thought he was a burglar. Shooter George Zimmerman was controversially acquitted on any charges in the teen's death. While his comments sparked a debate online, it's clear that Pharrell feels a strong connection to the current situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where protesters turned violent after hearing the grand jury's decision on Monday night. Following the decision, Pharrell tweeted: 'I'm heartbroken over the news of no indictment in Ferguson. Let's all pray for peace'. He says he still believes racism exists, and that the situation in Ferguson may have been calmer if President Obama went there to show his support. 'He didn't have to go and take a side; all he needed to do was show his presence and everybody would have straightened up. But he didn't go. I won't fault him. 'He's a man with a lot of weight on his shoulders, but I personally would have gone because being a ''man of the people'' means you're right there with them in it. Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr led by example.' Pharrell also made the strange decision to praise Bill Cosby during the interview, for the comedian's history preaching tough love to black youth. The actor is currently under fire after at least 17 women have come forward to accuse him of rape. 'I agree with him. When Cosby said it back then, I understood; I got it. Listen, we have to look at ourselves and take action for ourselves. 'Cosby can talk that talk because he created Fat Albert, he tried to buy NBC, he portrayed a doctor on The Cosby Show and had all of us wearing Coogi sweaters. You've got to respect him,' Pharrell said. The grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson on any charges related to Brown's death sparked violence between protesters and police in Ferguson, Missouri last Monday .","The singer said 'everyone is heartbroken' over the shooting of the Ferguson, Missouri teenager in August .

"Police in Wisconsin have begun an investigation after the body of a decorated and popular gymnast was found dead at the bottom of a restaurant dumb waiter connected to the kitchen on Monday. Emergency services were called to WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City at 8pm and pronounced Brooke Baures, 21, an employee there, dead at the scene. Fountain City Police have said the death appears to be a bizarre accident, without elaborating, and said they have found no signs of foul play. Police Chief Jason Mork said the dumbwaiter's opening is about 3 feet by 3 feet and the service elevator connects the first and second floors. Authorities say she was trapped in the small elevator when they arrived. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Brooke with her boyfriend, Joel Hinke, who played for their college football team the Winona State Warriors . Family: Brooke (far right) with her family at a Winona State Warriors game with boyfriend, Joel (front right) Friends: Baures was a Chicago Cubs fan and poses here with a friend and fellow supporter with a drink in hand . The exact cause and circumstances of the Wisconsin student's death have not been made public and officers said a medical examiner in Eau Claire will perform the autopsy on Tuesday. 'There are no indicators of of a criminal act; however the investigation remains open for the purpose of investigative follow-up and an immediate autopsy,' said a spokesman for the Fountain City Police Department. Police Chief Jason Mork said the Winona State University student was currently majoring in social work and expected to graduate next year. The accomplished athlete was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week earlier in 2014 and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media. Her college paid tribute to Baures, who was an accomplished member of the gymnastics team from 2011 to 2014. 'She was a leader on the team and a talented gymnast,' said WSU athletic director Eric Schoh in a statement. 'This is a tremendous loss for our community, and we ask that you keep Brooke and her family, friends, coaches and teammates in your thoughts.' According to Police Chief Mork, the dumbwaiter which transfers food between the 2nd and 1st floors of the WingDam kitchen is obviously not designed for human use. Accomplished: Brooke represented her college statewide in gymnastics and was twice named the gymnast of the week earlier in 2014 . Winner: Brooke poses with her coaches after taking home a triple haul of medals after a gymnastics meet . Place of work: This is the WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City - where Brooke, who was an employee was found dead at 8pm on Monday . The opening is only three feet by three feet and the elevator works in a manner similar to a garage door, said Mork. Amanda Schabacker, manager at WingDam Saloon & Grill, told the Winona Daily News the restaurant would be closed on Tuesday and refused to offer any more comment. Her boyfriend, Joel Hinke was also a student at Winona and played for their football team the Winona State Warriors. Photographs posted to social media show Brooke and her family happily posing for pictures at Warriors games. Baures was also a huge music fan and on her Facebook page posted a picture on November 22 with herself and country music stars Dan + Shay along with the caption, 'OMG OMG'. Huge fan: Brooke poses with Dan + Shay on November 22 with Joel and captioned the picture up with 'OMG OMG' Tributes: Friends and family and fellow students posted their messages of goodwill and condolence to Twitter in the aftermath of Brooke's death . Tributes from distraught friends have been flooding onto social media since her death was announced on December 1. Friend Annelie Schmittel posted, 'Thoughts and prayers go out to the family of my former student Brooke Baures, as well as my WSU Warriors family. Devastating news.' According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, dumbwaiter accidents are rare. According to the OSHA database, only two incidents, both fatal, have happened in the U.S. between 2003 and 2013.","Brooke Baures pronounced dead at the scene after 911 call on Monday .

"Promoter Frank Warren has admitted to receiving nearly 50 complaints about his ‘Bad Blood’ event at the ExCel in London on Saturday night. The show, headlined by Tyson Fury’s victory over Dereck Chisora in their heavyweight rematch, was blighted by ticketing issues and a late finish. Fans were left struggling to get home after Chisora was pulled out by his corner after the 10th round at 1.20am. Promoter Frank Warren (centre) admits receiving complaints after the heavyweight clash between Dereck Chisora (left) and Tyson Fury (right) Fury defeated Chisora - but their fight did not finish until 1.20am, leaving many people stranded in London . Warren told the Daily Telegraph’s Gareth Davies: ‘We had 18,500 people there and up to now we’ve probably had about 48 people complain. It was a combination of ticket issues and travel issues. They are all issues that will be dealt with. There were some duplicate tickets, obviously not from us. But, as always, we get the blame. ‘We don’t get these problems normally and it’s a lesson learnt. The inner ringside itself was sectioned off by three lots of barriers. I was very conscious of what might happen. ‘We will liaise with the police and security to ensure we deal with that. We’ve got a meeting this week to sort it out.’ The referee stops the fight in the 10th round after Chisora's corner decide their fighter can take no more . Disgruntled punters posted pictures of their duplicate tickets on Twitter . Several people took to Twitter to complain about duplicate tickets with one posting a picture of two sets of three costing £75 each. And another fan told Sportsmail: ‘At about 7pm a group of lads told me we were in their seats. I showed them our tickets and it appeared that we had exactly the same seats only we had got them from different websites. ‘This then seemed to go on all night; people saying they were in our seats and then showing us the same tickets.’ Chris Eubank Jnr (left) was defeated by Billy Joe Saunders (right) in Bad Blood's undercard fight . The British Boxing Board of Control confirmed that they would be looking into the show. The board’s General Secretary Robert Smith told Sportsmail ‘I’ve had correspondence regarding a number of issues with the show; the lateness of it being one of them. ‘I’ve been in correspondence with representatives of the promoter. ‘We had a number of security meetings before the tournament and had assurances from the security people. A number of issues have come out afterwards which we will look into. ‘Our next meeting is next Wednesday and if anything needs dealing with, we will deal with it then.’","Tyson Fury defeated Dereck Chisora in heavyweight rematch on Saturday .

"Peanuts cause allergic reactions chiefly when they have been dry-roasted, a study suggests. Tests carried out by Oxford University researchers found that eaten raw the nuts had little effect on the immune system. They are now working on safe, dry-roasted peanuts to help prevent an allergy that affects one in 50 children. Peanuts cause allergic reactions chiefly when they have been dry-roasted, a study suggests (file picture) ‘We did a simple experiment and found that the mice fed the dry-roasted proteins got an immune response indicative of allergy,’ said researcher Quentin Sattentau. ‘Whereas the mice fed the raw peanut proteins didn’t or did to a much lesser extent.’ The result was the same whether the mice were fed peanut protein or had it rubbed into broken skin – both ways in which peanuts are thought to trigger allergies in humans. Professor Sattentau added: ‘This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a potential trigger for peanut allergy has been directly shown.’ The finding helps explain why peanut allergy is much more common here than in the Far East, where the nuts are more commonly eaten raw, boiled or fried. It is believed that the process of dry-roasting involves temperatures high enough to change the peanut’s chemistry in a way that confuses the immune system and leads to allergic reactions. It will be some years before safer dry-roasted peanuts are on supermarket shelves and the complex nature of the immune system means that those who already have a peanut allergy are unlikely to be helped. While the majority of reactions are mild, nut allergy can trigger a life-threatening anaphylactic shock. The Oxford team said it would be premature for people to avoid the nuts because of their research, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.","Raw nuts have little effect on the immune system, researchers find .

"Even when goal-line technology and an inspired goalkeeper were working in their favour, QPR just could not quite get a break. Did they deserve one? Almost certainly not on the balance of a game where one side had noticeably higher ambitions than the other. Did Rob Green deserve more? Definitely. He was simply magnificent, a barrier that Swansea could not knock down for 78 minutes. And then, just like that, it was seven away defeats from seven trips. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail Big Match Stats: Swansea City 2-0 Queens Park Rangers . Swansea City's Ki Sung-Yueng celebrates scoring their eventual opener against QPR at the Liberty Stadium . Ki breaks the deadlock despite the challenge of Nedum Onuoha after his shot goes in off the post to finally beat Rob Green . Green can only watch from the turf as Ki's shot travels toward the far post and over the line . Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 6.5; Richards 6.5, Bartley 6.5, Williams 6.5, Taylor 6; Britton 6 (Shelvey 79), Ki 7; Routledge 7, Sigurdsson 7 (Carroll 87), Montero 7 (Dyer 70); Bony 7.

Ki Sung-Yueng broke the heart, going outside Nedum Onuoha and firing in off the post, and Wayne Routledge kicked dirt in their eyes with a low finish from the edge of the area five minutes later. It was cruel on only one man - a goalkeeper with a green shirt and a red face. But Harry Redknapp could hardly argue as he weighed up the worst possible yield from a run of away games against top-half opposition. ‘We have had hard games,’ he said. ‘We caught Newcastle on the back of their five-game winning run, and we went to Chelsea and Tottenham and Manchester United. ‘They have not been easy. You only have to look at the table – the teams that have come up have (to make) a big step up.’ Predictably, Garry Monk carried a happier disposition. He said: ‘Some of Rob Green’s saves were fantastic. He probably didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. ‘But for me that was our most complete performance.’ Green’s impact on that performance was felt almost immediately. He smothered Routledge after the winger was clean through after three minutes and then blocked Kyle Bartley’s header moments later. When Gylfi Sigurdsson had a shot deflected off Joey Barton, it was Green who scrambled across his line to keep it out. When Sigurdsson had a free-kick on the edge of the box towards the end of the period, it was Green who acrobatically kept the sheet clean, albeit with the help of goal-line technology. The ball was almost entirely over the line. QPR keeper Rob Green makes a finger tip save from Gylfi Sigurdsson in a sensational performance . Goal line technology judged in QPR's favour during a frustrating match for the Swans before they broke through . Green makes another diving save while the Premier League's most lethal striker - Wilfried Bony - lurks in the penalty area . Airbourne Green was a serious source of frustration for the home side with saves like this a common sight at the Liberty . For Swansea, it was looking like deja vu after battering Crystal Palace on Saturday and only taking a point. Monk said: ‘The message at half time was to keep moving the ball quickly and if we continue to create hopefully we will take one or two. Thankfully we were able to do that.’ For 78 minutes here, including two fine second-half saves by Green to deny Bony, there was no breaking through. Then the resistance broke. It was no less than each side deserved, barring one man. Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski is well-positioned to save a Leroy Fer (not pictured) header late in the first half .

"Bob Geldof has said he blames himself for the death of his daughter Peaches from a heroin overdose earlier this year. The Boomtown Rats singer said he ‘goes over and over and over’ what he could have done to help the 25-year-old mother of two who had started using the drug again in the months leading up to her death. Peaches was found dead by her husband Tom Cohen at their home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7, and Geldof admitted he knew she was battling heroin addiction before her overdose. He said: ‘You blame yourself. You’re the father who is responsible and clearly failed'. Scroll down for video .

Tragedy: Husband Tom Cohen found his wife dead  when he returned from a weekend away with the couple’s two-year-old son, Astala, left. Their one-year-old son Phaedra, right, was in the house with his mother . Geldof said:‘For anybody watching, who has a dead kid and you’re a parent. You go back, you go back, you go back, you go back, you go back, you go over, you go over. What could you have done? You do as much as you can. Asked if he knew about Peaches’ drug addiction, he said: ‘Yes, of course I knew about it and we did more than talk about it, yeah. But I don't want to go into that too much. 'She was an adult. When they are 18 they are off and running. But you advise, you are there - the usual dad stuff. When they mess up you try to clean up the mess. You admonish. I'm certainly not benign about the whole thing'. ‘I was never afraid to cry so I did. It is a ten minute thing and then on you go', he told BBC 5Live. He said newspaper attacks on his daughters following their mother Paula Yates’s death from a drug overdose in 2000 had also ‘damaged’ them. 'She was super bright. Too bright', he said. ‘She could never be still so you look for something that sedates you I suppose. ‘A very errant mind that could focus intensely on a book which she would consume and just absorb it. ‘But the rest was a franticness. She knew what life was supposed to be and God bless her she tried very hard to get there. And she didn’t make it.’ Geldof said performing with the Boomtown Rats helps him to escape the grief of losing his daughter. ‘I put on my snakeskin suit and I can be this other thing,’ he said. ‘It is utterly cathartic.

The coffin of Peaches Geldof arriving at St Mary Madgalene and St Lawrence Church, Kent on April 21 . An inquest in July heard that Peaches had started using heroin again in February, after taking the substitute drug methadone for two and a half years. Coroner Roger Hatch said she took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead. At the time of the tragedy Kent Police said the death was ‘sudden’ and ‘unexplained’. But her husband told the inquest he had seen Peaches flushing drugs she had hidden in the loft of their home down the toilet. He found her body when he returned from a weekend away with the couple’s two-year-old son, Astala. Their one-year-old son Phaedra was in the house with his mother. Police found heroin and syringes in the house. A forensic scientist said the drug had a purity of 61 per cent – much higher than the average drug sold on the street. A pathologist told the inquest that Peaches’ blood contained a high level of heroin, along with traces of codeine, methadone and morphine. There were puncture marks on her arms and legs. Geldof told 5Live: 'My life turned out to be extremely episodic. ‘I certainly do not want the two little chaps caught up in our story and I supposed because of Paula, because of the girls, because of me, we have been in the British people’s face for 40 years, much to their irritation, I think a lot of the time, but I have to say they have been very kind.’","Bob Geldof says he blames himself for his daughter's heroin overdose .

"Liverpool's anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone' played at the Golden Shoe award ceremony at Barcelona on Wednesday night as Luis Suarez dedicated the prize to his former team-mates. 'My three-and-a-half years there were spectacular and I would not have won this without them,' he said. 'I would also like to thank the man who who brought me to the club,' he added, looking across at Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish, who was in Barcelona to present him with the award. 'From the first moment I met him with Sofia [Suarez's wife] I took to him,' said Dalglish. 'He achieved so much last season and it's an honour to be here - I even cancelled a game of golf to make it.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Kenny Dalglish presents Luis Suarez with Golden Foot award . Luis Suarez looks delighted as he receives the Golden Shoe award from Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish . The pair laugh and shake hands as Suarez, now at Barcelona, accepts the award in front of an audience . Suarez is set to make his return to competitive action  against Real Madrid on October 25 . Dalglish was asked if he thought Suarez would succeed and he said: 'I don't think there is anyone who can stop him. He was brilliant at Ajax and Liverpool and I'm sure he will be success. And if it doesn't work out he can always come back to Liverpool on loan.' In a video message Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said: 'Good luck for the future mate we wish you well. Thanks for everything you did last season for us. Barcelona are very lucky to have you.' It was the Barcelona forward's wish that Gerrard be at the presentation but he was unable to travel. Suarez scored 31 goals last season and he said after the presentation that he was ready to start in the Clasico clash against Real Madrid on October 25 if picked. 'Every player has to be prepared to play every game - I feel good. Maybe if you had asked me two weeks ago the answer would not have been the same, but after the two friendlies with Uruguay I am very happy with the condition I am in. I feel a lot better than - thought I would.' Suarez returned to action for Uruguay in a friendly 1-1 draw against Saudi Arabia in Jiddah on October 10 . The former Ajax striker followed that up with a couple of goals in a 3-0 friendly win over Oman on October 13 . Suarez and Dalglish were reunited as the former Liverpool manager flew to Spain to present the award . Dalglish signed Suarez for Liverpool in 2011 and he was a success in his time at Anfield . Dalglish had a close bond with Suarez at Liverpool and staunchly defended his former charge when he was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra. Liverpool's next home game is against Hull on October 25 but their former star will hope to be busy that day as Barcelona travel to the Santiago Bernabeu for the Clasico. Lionel Messi, Suarez's Barcelona team-mate, has won the Golden Shoe in the last two seasons. The Uruguyan actually shares the honour this time with Cristiano Ronaldo, who also scored 31 goals last season. Suarez's haul enabled him to beat the previous record for one season at Liverpool, beating Robbie Fowler, who scored 28 goals in 1995-96.

"Samuel Eto'o resurrected his 'old man' celebration after scoring for Cameroon against Germany on Sunday night as the two countries prepared for the World Cup. The 33-year-old striker nipped in ahead of defender Mats Hummels to poke the ball past Germany goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on the hour mark. Eto'o, who was forced to rubbish claims he is nearing the end of his career after Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho questioned his age earlier in the season, raced towards the corner flag to celebrate. Opener: Samuel Eto'o pokes the ball home to give Cameroon the lead against Germany on Sunday night . Hitting back: Eto'o reprised this 'old man' celebration for Cameroon - he also did it in a Chelsea shirt . Germany: Weidenfeller, Boateng, Mertesacker, Hummels, Durm (Howedes, 85), Khedira (Kramer, 73), Kroos, Muller, Ozil (Podolski, 63), Reus, Gotze (Schurrle, 58). Subs: Zieler, Grosskreutz, Schmelzer, Schweinsteiger, Klose, Mustafi, Draxler, Ginter, Volland. Scorers: Muller, 66, Schurrle, 71. Booked: Boateng. Cameroon: Itandje, Djeugoue, Bedimo (Assou-Ekotto, 58), N'Koulou, Song, Mbia (N'Guemo, 46), Enoh, Matip, Choupo-Moting, Moukandjo, Eto'o (Webo, 90). Subs: N'Djock, Kana Biyik, Nounkeu, Aboubakar, Makoun, Chedjou, Idrissou, Bong Songo, Nyom, Salli, Olinga, Loe. Scorers: Eto'o 62, Choupo-Moting, 78. Booked: Song, Enoh. Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia) The former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker gave the Indomitable Lions the lead before Germany equalised just minutes later as Thomas Muller headed home Jerome Boateng's cross. The hosts then took the lead as Chelsea's Andre Schurrle converted Arsenal frontman Lukas Podolski's square ball from close range. However, the lead lasted just seven minutes as Cameroon frontman Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting - who plays his club football for Mainz and was born in Hamburg - hit a perfectly-executed left-foot shot into the corner of the net to draw Volker Finke's side level. Germany played without goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, captain Philipp Lahm and midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who are all nursing injuries. Left back Erik Durm made his debut, with another defender, Marcel Schmelzer, also injured. Germany have drawn their last two matches, with an under-strength side held 0-0 by Poland last month. The Germans also play Armenia on June 6, the day before they leave for Brazil. 'It would have been good if we had used our early chances. We seem to need a lot of chances to score, that has been evident in recent months,' said manager Joachim Low. Leveller: Thomas Muller heads in Jerome Boateng's cross to equalise for Germany .

"A sheriff has defended a police officer who stopped a black man who was walking with his hands in his pockets in snowy Michigan, saying he acted appropriately and the force has 'nothing to hide'. Brandon McKean, 25, was approached by the white deputy in Pontiac, Oakland, on Thanksgiving afternoon following a 911 call in which he was accused of 'making people nervous'. With his green hood up, he pulled out his cellphone and started filming the encounter, before posting the video online. It was later viewed and criticized by millions of people across the US. In the footage, McKean can be heard asking the unidentified officer: 'Wow, walking by, having your hands in your pockets makes people nervous to call the police, when it's snowing outside?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Caught on camera: Brandon McKean, 25, was approached by a police officer in Pontiac, Michigan, after he walked through the city with his hands in his pockets. Above, McKean and the deputy  film the encounter . Defense: Oakland County Sheriff, Mike Bouchard (pictured), has defended his officer's actions, pointing out that McKean edited his cellphone video before posting it, and therefore it did not show the real story . He adds: 'There's 10,000 people in Pontiac right now with their hands in their pockets', to which the officer replies  there has been 'a lot of robberies' in the area and he must inspect 'unusual conduct'. The footage of the incident - also videoed by the deputy at the time - led many to accuse the police of racial profiling, particularly in the wake of black 18-year-old Michael Brown's shooting death. But now, Oakland County Sheriff, Mike Bouchard, has defended his officer's actions, pointing out that McKean edited the video before posting it, and therefore it did not show the real story. In a Facebook post, he released the deputy's video of the events, in which the officer explains to McKean that the 911 call was made by the owner of local firm which had been robbed seven times. Alongside the video, Mr Bouchard's sheriff's office wrote: 'The caller and his employees were concerned about an individual who had walked by the front window of the business five or six times, while looking inside with his hands in his pockets. Radioing his colleagues: In the footage, McKean can be heard asking the officer (pictured): 'Wow, walking by, having your hands in your pockets makes people nervous to call the police, when it's snowing outside?' Encounter: He adds: 'There's 10,000 people in Pontiac right now with their hands in their pockets', to which the officer replies there has been 'a lot of robberies' in the area and he must inspect 'unusual conduct' 'Fearing for their safety, the business dialed 911 and the deputy responded. In the unedited version of the event, the individual stated that if he had called the police on a suspicious person, he would expect the police to respond, check the area, and talk to the suspicious person being called about.' The post concluded: 'The Deputy did not detain or pat down the individual and considering the nature of the call responded in a very restrained and professional manner.' Mr Bouchard explained that the potential robbery suspect was wearing a green hoodie and a black jacket that matched the description of what McKean was donning in the officer's phone video. Speaking to ABC 7, he added that the officer had probable cause to make the stop, treated McKean with respect and could even have gone further that he did by patting him down and asking for ID. 'We have nothing to hide when we do our job,' he said. The footage of the incident - also videoed by the deputy at the time - led many to accuse the police of racial profiling, particularly in the wake of black 18-year-old Michael Brown's shooting death.

Explanation: In a Facebook post (pictured), Mr Bouchard released the deputy's video, in which the officer explains to McKean that the 911 call was made by the owner of local firm which had been robbed seven times . However, McKean told the Huffington Post he was not wearing the same clothing as the suspect and was walking home in freezing temperatures when he was 'singled out' by the police officer. In McKean's footage, the officer can be heard asking him: 'Am I inconveniencing you?'. McKean replies that he is pleased he is capturing the incident on camera, to which the deputy says: 'Me too.' McKean then makes reference to the  protests over alleged police racism that are sweeping the US after a grand jury's decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson for shooting Brown on August 9. Before being told he is free to leave the scene, he retorts: 'Because of the whole police situation going on across the country this is outrageous.'

"Main street retailer Kmart has released a hilarious new holiday advert, which stars five pregnant dancers twerking and thrusting their bellies to a hip hop remix of festive favorite Santa Baby. The slightly bizarre ad, which was released on the company's YouTube page, showcases underwear brand Joe Boxer's range of cozy holiday loungewear and follows on from a last year's Kmart Christmas campaign, featuring six boxer-clad male models shaking their hips in time to Jingle Bells. Clearly eager to repeat the success of the viral video, which has received more than 18.3 million views on YouTube, the retailer has taken the festive fun to a whole new level with this campaign, which shows each of the mothers-to-be showcasing some seriously impressive moves, emphasizing their big bellies with a series of twerks and thrusts. Scroll down for video . Shake your bump! The five dancers perform to a hip hop remix of Santa Baby . Back-up plan: Kmart had to enlist two back-up dancers to wait in the wings in case one of the stars went into labor while filming . Clad in comfy-looking pajama bottoms, tight red tops and matching socks, the women first appear with their backs to the camera and are shown only as silhouettes, hiding the fact that they are pregnant. But just a few seconds into the campaign, the dancers turn into the spotlight and shake their rotund bellies at the camera, showing off their best hip hop moves, which, luckily, appear to have been unaffected by their pregnancies. The quirky concept was not without its complications however; according to USA Today, all of the women featured were in the last trimester of their pregnancy, in order to ensure they had appropriately large bellies. But with just a few weeks to go until each of their due dates, the retailer had to ensure it had back-ups waiting in the wings, in case one of the stars went into labor while on set. Merry Christmas! The advert is the latest in a line of entertaining festive campaigns . Festive fun: Each of the women is modeling a cozy pair of pajamas from underwear brand Joe Boxer . Surprise! At the start of the ad, the women hide their pregnant bellies, before whipping round to reveal them . Since the advert was filmed last month, at least one of the women has given birth - and the rest are expected to go into labor before Christmas. To accompany the womenswear ad, which has already racked up more than 210,000 view since it was uploaded yesterday, Kmart also debuted a menswear version last month, which features five male models using their stomachs as drums on which they bang out a festive carol. The retailer uploaded the menswear advert on November 17 and it has since been viewed by more than 1.1 million people, many of whom have been quick to congratulate the retailer on its unique advertising strategy. Bang the drums: To accompany the womenswear campaign, Kmart have also released a second Christmas ad which showcases the brand's menswear designs . Controversy at Christmas: Last year's campaign, which featured six boxer-clad models, came under fire from some shoppers who claimed it was 'disgusting' and 'sexist' 'Love the ad, and love YOU Kmart! :) Always look forward to your Holiday themed commercials, keep it up!' user Justin Wallace commented on the Jingle Bellies video, while Abelinda Morte added: 'I like this even better than last years!' Last year, Kmart faced criticism from some shoppers, who claimed the retailer's Show Your Joe advert was sexist and distasteful. 'You can forget me stepping into any of your stores. Pull that ad off the air,' one person wrote on the store's Facebook page, while another suggested: 'You should find someone to do better commercial writing.'","The expectant stars had to have back-ups waiting on-set in case they went into labor during filming .

Monteith’s body was found in a room at the Vancouver Canada hotel on July 13 shortly after midday. A coroner’s report revealed the 31-year-old actor – who played Finn Hudson on the hit Fox television series - was taking heroin and drinking champagne alone in his hotel room on the night of his death. He and his manager dined on the Thursday night before his death with Maureen Webb, the co-founder of Project Limelight Society, who said the actor 'looked so good, so healthy'.

In all of our hearts.. We love you so. Happy Birthday.’ ‘I wanted to be a cool kid,’ he told The Modern Honolulu. ‘[So] I said to them, “You guys are the coolest. How can I help? I want to learn.” One older boy, who arranged the rental of the church for their late-night DJ all-ages party, said “Come back here after the party and we'll start you out.” I showed up at 2 a.m. and they handed me a stack of garbage bags.’ He spent the rest of the school year tidying up after hard-partying seniors.

"He enjoyed this one. Beaming smile, arms outstretched and sliding on his knees into the corner flag, revelling in the adulation that was showered upon him. Steven Gerrard had scored 176 goals for Liverpool before Tuesday night, including strikes that defined European and domestic finals, but No 177 seemed different, sweeter almost. It was, perhaps, a reminder of his ability to produce just when it matters. With all the speculation surrounding his contract, all the conjecture about whether he will stay at Anfield or pursue a fresh challenge next year, Gerrard could not have provided a more telling riposte when he burst into Leicester City’s area in the 54th minute to settle a game Liverpool needed to win.

CLICK HERE for all the stats, goals - including Jordan Henderson's strike (above) - and heat maps from the King Power Stadium . Can they ever be without him? In a word, no. Gerrard may be in the autumn of his career but he was a towering presence at The King Power Stadium, driving his team forward relentlessly. Without him here, another two points would have been squandered. ‘It’s not about me,’ he pointed out. ‘It should be about a great team performance.’ Gerrard can argue the praise should be spread but Liverpool are unbeaten in three games – their best sequence of the campaign – thanks to him, his goal sandwiched by strikes from Adam Lallana and Jordan Henderson after Leonardo Ulloa raised the prospect of a shock. This is exactly what Brendan Rodgers – and his captain – required. Restored, as expected, to the starting line-up after a weekend break, he was left in no doubt by the fans in the visiting section over his place in their affections. His name was sung loudly and frequently, the songs drowning out barbs from Leicester’s supporters: do no doubt the vast majority of Liverpudlians want him to prolong the relationship they have shared into a seventeenth campaign. Liverpool’s ambitions, though, should not be so intrinsically linked to Gerrard. At 34, he should not be carrying the team. Others have to take responsibility, not least the expensive acquisitions who arrived during the summer as part of the restructuring programme. That is why Rodgers will have been satisfied to see Lallana score Liverpool’s opener. Things may not have not been smooth since he left Southampton but this was more like it, his second goal of the campaign coming at just the right time. Crisp and instant, it was a terrific left-foot finish, drilled in after Wes Morgan headed Lucas Leiva’s high-ball into his path. There looked to be some fury in his fist-jabbing celebration but, on the bench, Rodgers only briefly acknowledged it. What had happened five minutes prior had dulled his mood. A significant part of Liverpool’s troubles so far have stemmed from an inability to keep clean sheets and – more accurately – their bewildering ability to give away cheap goals. Never was this more evident than here. Leicester City mascot Filbert Fox greets some young home fans at the King Power Stadium ahead of the game .

Rodgers’ idea is to have a goalkeeper who is comfortable with the ball at his feet and give assurance to his defence but Mignolet is doing nothing of the sort at present, his performances a constant worry to his manager and team-mates. He had been ordered to go back to basics in the 1-0 win against Stoke – make saves, give it simple – but none of those instructions were carried over and a ridiculous error in the 19th minute almost handed Leicester the lead, when Mignolet gave the ball straight to Esteban Cambiasso. The Argentine could not make him pay, his left foot shot zipping fractionally wide, but the reprieve was only temporary as in the next attack Leicester had the lead. Liverpool, farcically, failed to clear their lines when defending a counterattack. Jamie Vardy caused the trouble, sprinting at Liverpool’s back four. Mignolet was weak and needed Martin Skrtel to head Vardy’s shot off the line but he couldn’t gather the rebound and Ulloa profited, his left-foot drive ending in the net via rebounds off the post and the back of the Belgian’s head. Shaking his head in disbelief, Mignolet stood with his hands on his hips, smiling ruefully. This, however, was no laughing matter. The longer he continues to be found wanting, the more vulnerable his side will be. It is an issue Liverpool must address. On this occasion, it didn’t prove costly. High on endeavour and brimming with determination, Leicester did not play like the worst team in the Barclays Premier League but every error they make is being ruthlessly punished. Nobody knows that better than Morgan. Having teed up Lallana, he provided the ‘assist’ for Gerrard to gleefully smash home in the 54th minute, after he tried to cut out a centre from Sterling after Lallana and Henderson had combined. It was his first goal in open play since January 28. Morgan’s night reached its nadir on the hour when his weak back pass allowed Rickie Lambert a free run at goal. Floundering, Morgan yanked Lambert’s arm back and sent him sprawling and gave referee Lee Mason a simple decision. Red card, game over. Leicester should have been down to nine when Kasper Schmeichel collided with Gerrard but frustrations were only temporary. Schmeichel erred in the 84th minute, Sterling cut the ball back and Henderson swept in. Gerrard, fittingly, celebrated that one with relish, too.

The Duchess also wore diamond earrings and a pearl necklace at tonight’s event. The reception was being held by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, according to the Royal Diary. The tiara is understood to be a legacy of Camilla’s maternal grandmother Sonia Rosemary Cubitt, Baroness Ashcombe (née Keppel). Earlier today, the Prince of Wales made royal history by opening a new academy aimed at inspiring the broadcasters of tomorrow - by unveiling an electronic plaque. It took a press of a button to launch the Sky Academy Careers Lab at the west London campus of the broadcaster Sky in Osterley. Arrival: Camilla was pictured with Prince Charles arriving at a reception for members of the diplomatic corps . Spotted before: It is the same headpiece Camilla wore to her first wedding to Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973 . The electronic plaque appeared on a screen seconds after the heir to the throne, who was joined by the Duchess of Cornwall, touched a tablet screen. During their tour of the campus, Camilla could not resist trying her hand at controlling the robot cameras when the royal couple visited the Sky Sports News HQ studio. The royal couple split up to watch groups of children working in mini news studios with the pupils acting as cameramen, presenters, directors and producers. In another part of the campus the Duchess was intrigued by an interactive wall that showed scenes from various departments at Sky when a visitor looked through holes in the wall.

"English cricket received another boost on Sunday when Steven Finn was called up to the squad for Thursday’s fourth Investec Test against India in Manchester less than eight months after he was deemed ‘unselectable’ and sent home from the Ashes tour. Finn, who has not played a Test since he was all-but ignored by captain Alastair Cook on the final morning at Trent Bridge against Australia in July 2013, replaces Liam Plunkett in the 13-man party after the Yorkshire seamer pulled out with an injury to his left ankle. And with the Old Trafford surface expected to offer enough bounce to keep the taller bowlers interested, the 6ft 7in Finn could walk straight back into the side in place of Chris Jordan, who went wicketless during England’s otherwise triumphant victory last week’s third Test in Southampton and struggled with his control. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook praises England . Flying Finn: The Middlesex fast bowler will come in to the England squad for Liam Plunkett . Looking forlorn: Finn struggled in his last Test for England (left), the first Ashes Test of last summer, but has had more success in the LV= County Championship with Middlesex . Cook, Anderson, Moeen Ali, Ballance, Bell, Broad, Buttler, Finn, Jordan, Robson, Root, Stokes, Woakes . Angus Fraser, Finn’s director of cricket at Middlesex and an England selector, told Sportsmail: ‘The time is right. He’s come through every challenge placed in front of him this season. There are obviously no guarantees of anything and he’ll be nervous. But he should take a lot of confidence from his selection.’ It was painful to watch Finn’s decline from the fearsome fast bowler with 90 wickets in 23 Tests into the disconsolate figure bowling in the nets in Australia as he tried to reconstruct his action. Recently he said: ‘It was horrible, standing at the back of my mark thinking, “Where is this going to go?”’ So alien did the ball feel, he even claimed to have lost sensation in his fingertips. His downward spiral had begun in 2012, when South Africa’s captain Graeme Smith opportunistically objected to Finn’s habit of dislodging the bails with his right knee at the point of delivery. In a bid to remedy the problem, Finn went wide of the stumps — and gradually found his technique unravelling. An attempt to wean him on to a shorter run-up did not help either. Net loss: Finn declined during the Ashes in Australia as he tried to reconstruct his bowling action . But some sensitive remedial work with Middlesex assistant coach Richard Johnson, himself a former Test bowler, helped restore Finn’s confidence. And his 44 wickets this season in Division One of the County Championship have come at a respectable 29 runs each. Johnson said: ‘He’s obviously gone through a hell of a lot in the last few months but he’s now at a stage where he’s bowling well and confident in himself. Given an opportunity, I think he’ll do well. In his own head, he’s back to bowling how he wants to bowl.’ Finn received the call on Sunday from national selector James Whitaker after heading down to Exeter to be with his girlfriend and prepare for a one-day game in Taunton for England Lions. But he has headed back to London to collect his Test kit before joining up with the full squad in Manchester. Fraser said: ‘I spoke to him and he’s really excited and looking forward to it. I’m very proud of both him and Richard Johnson. I’ve just let them get on with it and they’ve worked very well together. Missing out: Liam Plunkett has been withdrawn from the England squad because of an ankle injury . The hope now in the England dressing-room is that the Old Trafford pitch serves up the kind of pace and bounce which — before the square was rotated 90 degrees — used to be popular with Steve Harmison. Fraser was on Sunday poring over footage from Lancashire’s Twenty20 quarter-final in Manchester against Glamorgan on Saturday, and was especially pleased to see a match-changing triple-wicket maiden from home seamer Jordan Clark. ‘The pitch looked like it had a bit of bounce in it,’ he said. The Indians were impressed with Finn when England visited for a one-day tour at the end of 2011, even though they lost 5-0, and again when he and Jimmy Anderson bowled Cook’s team to victory in the third Test at Kolkata in December 2012. And he has enjoyed success in the past against Ajinkya Rahane, who is averaging 54 in the current series. Finn is only 25, still a few years away from his fast-bowling peak. If, after his traumatic winter, he’s impatient to scale it more quickly than that, no-one will be blaming him.

"Visitors from outer space or a natural phenomena? Surfers and early morning walkers were stunned to find thousands of 'alien eggs' on a Sydney beach this weekend. Locals in Dee Why, on the city's North Shore, reported seeing a large number of the strange objects which had washed ashore overnight. But rather than the green spheres being something from another planet, scientists explained they were a type of sponge-like seaweed that forms egg shapes possibly to protect themselves from predators. Scroll down for video . The mysterious green 'alien eggs' strewn across Sydney's Dee Why Beach . Locals said they'd never seen anything like the green algae balls that washed ashore at Dee Why this week . Beach-goers said they'd never seen anything like it, describing the balls as 'alien eggs, 'alien hairballs', Japanese moss balls and UFOs (Unidentified Floating Objects). 'About three days ago, there were a few egg-shaped balls but then today, they were much bigger and everywhere on the beach,' Naraweena resident Jenny Zhang told The Manly Daily. Scarlett de Villiers from nearby Davidson saw the weird balls on her regular morning beach walk. 'It was a windy day with a very high tide. I picked one up and squeezed it and it was so squishy - but I wasn't sure if it was alive and was worried I might hurt anything inside!' she told the Daily Mail. 'It struck me how perfectly shaped they all were and how green and alive they looked.' Associate Professor Alistair Poore from the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of NSW said the balls were probably a rare type of living green algae, which has only been seen a handful of times around the world. The balls are thought to be an extremely rare species of filamentous green algae. The living organisms are known in Japan as 'Marumo' and Cladophora ball or Lake ball in English, and are sometimes found in freshwater lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. ‘Aegagropilious’ describes the habit of free living algae (algae not attached to rocks) forming into balls. Floating algae balls are thought to be brought ashore by warmer weather and the rough wave conditions. It's unknown why the algae forms into balls. One hypothesis is that a ball-shape helps protect the algae from hungry fish, another that it may help them roll back into the water and avoid drying out when they wash ashore. 'I’ve seen similar things - sometimes dead sea grass can roll around and form balls like underwater tumbleweeds but that’s made of dead material and these look to be living,' he told The Manly Daily. 'It is a habit known as ""aegagropilious"", where the algae is free living (not on rocks) and forms into spherical balls.' The Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust’s Alan Millar said the algae balls made their way to the beach with the right biophysical conditions, but that these conditions don't align every Spring. 'It’s clearly another response to spring sunshine, and just the right wave conditions to tumble them,' said Mr Millar. 'Alien hairballs': The sponge like sea balls are thought to be rare living algae, sometimes seen in freshwater lakes in the Northern Hemisphere . Scientists think the algae forms into balls to protect itself from fish and other predators or so that they can roll back into the sea when washed ashore . It's the second unusual natural spectacle to hit Sydney's Beaches in a matter of weeks. Last month, the waves at Manly Beach were lit up a fluorescent blue for three nights by 'agitated' phytoplankton, apparently signalling the start of Spring.","Beach-goers describe green 'alien hairballs' washed up on a Sydney's Dee Why Beach .

"For more stats and facts from Old Trafford, click here for our brilliant Match Zone . Manchester United's European exile means that December dawned before Louis van Gaal has taken charge of his first competitive match under the floodlights at Old Trafford. At this rate, the Dutchman will not have to wait so long next year. A fourth win in a row last night kept Van Gaal’s team in fourth position in the table and on course for the Champions League place he has targeted in his first season in English football. United had to do it without the injured Wayne Rooney and Angel Di Maria, and it wasn’t particularly pretty. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match stats: Manchester United 2-1 Stoke City .

Ratings by JOE BERNSTEIN at Old Trafford . They finished the match desperately clinging on as goalkeeper David de Gea produced a magnificent save to keep out a point-blank header from former United striker Mame Biram Diouf deep into added time. Moments later, the Goal Decision System was called upon to confirm that Diouf’s shot had not crossed the line when Ashley Young somehow kept out a shot. This time last year, United were losing twice at home in the space of four days to Everton and Newcastle and it’s fair to say this one might well have got away from them as well. But Van Gaal has obviously instilled some fight in his squad and the signs of progress are clear to see now, even if the manner of victory left much room for improvement. ‘We were lucky at the end but we deserved to win,’ he admitted. ‘As a top club you have to win and therefore I’m very happy with his result. ‘But it was not our best performance. We were not aggressive enough in the first half. 'The second half was better, we created more chances but we need to score more goals. The last few moments were not necessary.’ News of Di Maria’s expected absence arrived earlier in the day courtesy of his wife Jorgelina, who confirmed on social media that United’s £60million record signing had suffered a ‘small tear’ in his hamstring. However, Rooney’s absence came as something of a surprise and the England captain will have a scan on his injured knee on Wednesday. ‘My opinion is that it is not so heavy but I am not a doctor,’ said Van Gaal, who revealed that Daley Blind could be back from his knee injury by the end of the year. Rooney’s absence gave striker James Wilson the opportunity to make his first start under Van Gaal a day after his 19th birthday following six appearances as a substitute this season. The youngster impressed but missed a great chance to put United out of sight when clean through in the second half. In theory, Van Gaal could not have wished for a better opportunity to extend his winning run. Stoke had lost on all 11 previous visits to Old Trafford and their goalkeeper Asmir Begovic almost gifted the hosts a goal with an awful pass to Erik Pieters early on. Robin van Persie intercepted and squared the ball to Ander Herrera, who opted to shoot first time and clutched his head in his hands as it flew well over. United went ahead in the 21st minute as they swept down the left and Juan Mata played the ball into the path of Herrera. He swung a cross towards the back post and Pieters appeared to be rooted to the spot as Marouane Fellaini rose above him to plant a downward header past Begovic. Stoke were level six minutes before the break when Fellaini was guilty of undoing his good work. Quite what the big Belgian was thinking when he pulled away from visiting winger Oussama Assaidi’s high boot clutching his neck, only he knows. There had been no contact whatsoever, but even Assaidi stopped momentarily as Fellaini rolled around near the halfway line. Bojan Krkic did not hesitate, though, breaking forward on a mazy run that seemed to have reached a dead-end on the edge of the United box where the ball got caught up between Chris Smalling’s legs.

Match-winner Juan Mata has scored 10 goals for Manchester United – four of them scored under Louis van Gaal, and three apiece for David Moyes and Ryan Giggs . It rolled loose towards Steven Nzonzi and he produced a magnificent finish beyond De Gea from 20 yards. The winner arrived in the 59th minute after Pieters took down Antonio Valencia in full flight. Mata floated a free-kick over from the right flank and it bounced through into the corner of the net, even though Marcos Rojo claimed it had brushed his hair. Either way, Mark Hughes felt the Argentine was offside. ‘The lad Rojo, it doesn't matter if he doesn't touch it, he is clearly interfering with play,’ said the Stoke boss after a third straight defeat. ‘So the referee and his assistant should have cancelled that out. It’s the luck we’re having at the moment.’ That should really been that but Hughes threw on Marko Arnautovic and Peter Crouch and the proverbial kitchen sink. It almost worked as well, but De Gea once again came to United’s rescue, and then Young. It’s United’s Christmas party on Wednesday night. Their team-mates owe them a drink.

"A chilly Arctic summer has left 533,000 more square miles of ocean covered with ice than at the same time last year – an increase of 29 per cent. The rebound from 2012’s record low comes six years after the BBC reported that global warming would leave the Arctic ice-free in summer by 2013. Instead, days before the annual autumn re-freeze is due to begin, an unbroken ice sheet more than half the size of Europe already stretches from the Canadian islands to Russia’s northern shores. Scroll down for video . Since publication of the original version of this article, the US source of the figures – the NASA-funded National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) - was discovered to have made a huge error and then quietly corrected the figure without mentioning it. On September 4, NSIDC, based at the University of Colorado, stated on its website that in August 2013 the Arctic ice cover recovered by a record 2.38 million sq km – 919,000 sq miles – from its 2012 low. News of this figure was widely reported – including by Mailonline - on September 8. But on September 10, the NSIDC quietly changed it to 1.38 million sq km (533,000 sq miles) – and replaced the original document so the old figure no longer shows up on a main Google search. It can now only be found on an old ‘cached’ page. The figures in this article have now been corrected. Prompted by an inquiry from ‘green’ blogger Bob Ward, the NSIDC’s spokeswoman Natasha Vizcarra said the mistake was a ‘typographical error’, telling him: ‘There are no plans to make a statement on the change because it was not an error in the data.’ The Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific has remained blocked by pack-ice all year. More than 20 yachts that had planned to sail it have been left ice-bound and a cruise ship attempting the route was forced to turn back. Some eminent scientists now believe the world is heading for a period of cooling that will not end until the middle of this century – a process that would expose computer forecasts of imminent catastrophic warming as dangerously misleading. The disclosure comes 11 months after The Mail on Sunday triggered intense political and scientific debate by revealing that global warming has ‘paused’ since the beginning of 1997 – an event that the computer models used by climate experts failed to predict. In March, this newspaper further revealed that temperatures are about to drop below the level that the models forecast with ‘90 per cent certainty’. The pause – which has now been accepted as real by every major climate research centre – is important, because the models’ predictions of ever-increasing global temperatures have made many of the world’s economies divert billions of pounds into ‘green’ measures to counter  climate change. Those predictions now appear gravely flawed. The continuing furore caused by The . Mail on Sunday’s revelations – which will now be amplified by the return . of the Arctic ice sheet – has forced the UN’s climate change body to . reconsider its position. The . UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was due in October . to start publishing its Fifth Assessment Report – a huge three-volume . study issued every six or seven years. It will hold a pre-summit in . Stockholm later this month. Only six years ago, the BBC reported that the Arctic would be ice-free in summer by 2013, citing a scientist in the US who claimed this was a ‘conservative’ forecast. Perhaps it was their confidence that led more than 20 yachts to try to sail the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to  the Pacific this summer. As of last week, all these vessels were stuck in the ice, some at the eastern end of the passage in Prince Regent Inlet, others further west at Cape Bathurst. Shipping experts said the only way these vessels were likely to be freed was by the icebreakers of the Canadian coastguard. According to the official Canadian government website, the Northwest Passage has remained ice-bound and impassable  all summer. The BBC’s 2007 report quoted scientist  Professor Wieslaw Maslowski, who based his views on super-computer models and the fact that ‘we use a high-resolution regional model for the Arctic Ocean and sea ice’. He was confident his results were ‘much more realistic’ than other projections, which ‘underestimate the amount of heat delivered to the sea ice’. Also quoted was Cambridge University expert . Professor Peter Wadhams. He backed Professor Maslowski, saying his model was ‘more efficient’ than others because it ‘takes account of processes that happen internally in the ice’. He added: ‘This is not a cycle; not just a fluctuation. In the end, it will all just melt away quite suddenly.’ Leaked documents show that governments which support and finance the IPCC are demanding more than 1,500 changes to the report’s ‘summary for policymakers’. They say its current draft does not properly explain the pause. At the heart of the row lie two questions: the extent to which temperatures will rise with carbon dioxide levels, as well as how much of the warming over the past 150 years – so far, just 0.8C – is down to human greenhouse gas emissions and how much is due to natural variability. In its draft report, the IPCC says it is ‘95 per cent confident’ that global warming has been caused by humans – up from 90 per cent in 2007. This claim is already hotly disputed. US climate expert Professor Judith Curry said last night: ‘In fact, the uncertainty is getting bigger. It’s now clear the models are way too sensitive to carbon dioxide. I cannot see any basis for the IPCC increasing its confidence level.’ She pointed . to long-term cycles  in ocean temperature, which have a huge influence . on climate and  suggest the world may be approaching a period similar to . that from 1965 to 1975, when there was a clear cooling trend. This led . some scientists at the time to forecast an imminent ice age. Professor . Anastasios Tsonis, of the University of Wisconsin, was one of the first . to investigate the ocean cycles. He said: ‘We are already in a cooling . trend, which I think will continue for the next 15 years at least. There . is no doubt the warming of the 1980s and 1990s has stopped. Then... NASA satellite images showing the spread of Arctic sea ice 27th August 2012 . ...And now, much bigger: The same Nasa image taken in 2013 . ‘The IPCC claims its models show a pause of 15 years can be expected. But that means that after only a very few years more, they will have to admit they are wrong.’ Others are more cautious. Dr Ed Hawkins, of Reading University, drew the graph published by The Mail on Sunday in March showing how far world temperatures have diverged from computer predictions. He admitted the cycles may have caused some of the recorded warming, but insisted that natural variability alone could not explain all of the temperature rise over the past 150 years. Nonetheless, the belief that summer Arctic ice is about to disappear remains an IPCC tenet, frequently flung in the face of critics who point to the pause. Yet there is mounting evidence that Arctic ice levels are cyclical. Data uncovered by climate historians show that there was a massive melt in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by intense re-freezes that ended only in 1979 – the year the IPCC says that shrinking began. Professor Curry said the ice’s behaviour over the next five years would be crucial, both for understanding the climate and for future policy. ‘Arctic sea ice is the indicator to watch,’ she said.","533,000 more square miles of ocean covered with ice than in 2012 .

"NBC News medical correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman will be back on the network on Wednesday after being shelved for more than a month following a violation of her quarantine for possible Ebola exposure. A network executive said on Tuesday that Snyderman, 62, will report on a medical issue for the Today show and NBC's Nightly News. The story won't be about Ebola. There was some question about whether the veteran medical journalist would ever return to NBC News. Dr Nancy Snyderman, pictured on NBC's Today show in 2011, will return to screens on Wednesday to report on a medical story - but not about Ebola . She had been reporting on the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC in October at the time a cameraman who briefly worked with her, Ashoka Mukpo, came down with the deadly virus. Mukpo was transferred back to the U.S. for treatment at a Nebraska medical facility and has since recovered. Snyderman and the rest of the NBC team were urged to quarantine themselves for a 21-day period upon their return to the United States. Neither she nor anyone else from the network came down with Ebola. During the midst of that quarantine, Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant, prompting New Jersey officials to make her quarantine mandatory. Her takeout foray angered her bosses and unleashed a bitter response online, with some suggestions by viewers that they would have a hard time trusting her again after the mistake in judgment. NBC News President Deborah Turness told Dr Snyderman to take some time off. A statement from NBC said: 'While in Liberia Dr Nancy and her team delivered first class, first-hand reporting from the front lines of this tragic and monumental story. 'Their subsequent departure from Monrovia, their return to the U.S. and period of quarantine has been a challenging time. 'We have encouraged them – and they have agreed – to take some time off with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives. We very much look forward to their return next month.' There's no word on whether Snyderman will address the issue with viewers when she returns to the air. Snyderman, a surgeon, has been at NBC News since 2006 after spending 17 years as a medical correspondent for ABC News. Dr Nancy Snyderman was placed in mandatory quarantine for Ebola after covering the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC .","A network executive said Dr Snyderman will report on a medical issue for the Today show on Wednesday - but the story won't be about Ebola .

"An elephant who was brought to tears after being held in chains and beaten for more than 50 years has finally been declared free from his former abusive owners. Raju  was left bleeding from spiked shackles and living on hand-outs from passing tourists after he was captured and tied up by his 'owner'. The majestic animal had been forced to hold out his trunk and beg for coins from passers-by – surviving only on plastic and paper for food in the Uttar Pradesh area of India. Scroll down for video . Raju celebrates by playing in the water at the Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in India after it was ruled he is finally free of his former abusive owners . Raju's former owners had launched a legal battle in the Indian courts to reclaim him after insisting he was their 'rightful property' This prompted a 10-strong team of vets and wildlife experts as well as 20 forestry department officers and six policemen to seize Raju from his suffering in July of this year. But, after 50 years of torture, the animal cried tears of relief after he was rescued by a wildlife charity in a daring midnight operation – fittingly on American Independence Day. However, last month the elephant's future was left hanging in the balance after his former owners launched a legal battle to reclaim him after insisting he was their 'rightful property'. But last night after a series of hearings, an Indian court ruled that Raju must stay with his rescuers from the British charity Wildlife SOS. Founder of the charity Kartick Satyanarayan, who led the daring, midnight rescue to save Raju said: 'We are beyond overjoyed that Raju is finally saved. 'This is a huge victory, not only for Raju, but for every elephant suffering in pain silently. In the court in India, Wildlife SOS lawyers argued an elephant cannot be owned by someone under Indian law as they are all owned by the Government . Founder of the Wildlife SOS charity Kartick Satyanarayan said it was unthinkable that Raju may have had to be returned to his former life . 'Elephants are majestic, intelligent animals, who are proven to grieve and feel emotion – so for an elephant to suffer for 50 years in chains, as Raju has, is truly barbaric. 'When his former owners launched a legal bid to get him back it was unthinkable that he could return to the life he'd had begging on the streets in shackles. 'We were determined to fight for him to ensure he could live out his days free from beatings and harm and we've had many a sleepless night worrying about what the future held for him. 'He had been so terribly brutalised for 50 years that we feared he'd be unable to live with his own kind. He didn't even know how to be an elephant. But now he's joined our herd of rescued Indian elephants it's like he's always been with them.' In the court in India, Wildlife SOS lawyers argued an elephant cannot be owned by someone under Indian law as they are all owned by the Government. They successfully argued that only a license issued from the Chief Wildlife Warden is proof of ownership. The legal team of Raju's former owners were unable to produce documents to show that they were the certified owners of the elephant . Wildlife experts believe that Raju was poached from his mother as a young calf before being sold on and treated as a commodity . When the legal team of Raju's previous owner were unable to produce a certificate the case was dismissed. Wildlife SOS executive director Nikki Sharp explained: 'This meant that Raju was finally truly free and there is no chance he will be returned to the shackles that chained him for 50 years. 'It was completely outrageous to us that two months after we'd cut his chains his freedom was threatened. 'He had just started to settle into his new home with our charity, making friends and learning to trust people. 'It was too cruel to contemplate that this was under threat. 'Although we always hoped we would win this case because we all love Raju we couldn't help but feel profound anxiety over what was happening. Now, finally his future is secure.' The court case followed the rescue of Raju by the London-based charity who had stepped in to save the elephant from dying in his bonds. Mr Satyanarayan added: 'Like all of the elephants we have rescued, we believe Raju was poached from the his mother as a young calf. A 10-strong team of vets and wildlife experts were joined by 20 forestry department officers and six policemen to seize Raju from his suffering in July . The head vet from the charity Wildlife SOS Dr Yaduraj Khadpekar had the job of freeing Raju from his chains . He was discovered have been held in chains which had left him bleeding from spiked shackles and was forced to beg for food from passing tourists . 'The poachers either slaughter the mother, or they drive the herd into traps that are small enough only for the babies to fall into. The mother cries for her baby for days after he's been stolen – it is a sickening trade. 'The calves are then tied and beaten until they submit to their owners – their spirits are effectively broken. 'Raju's case was particularly tragic. He'd been poached as a calf and then he has been sold on and sold on. Incredibly we believe he has had up to 27 owners – he's been treated as a commodity every two years of his life. The moment that Raju was finally freed from his chains, wildlife experts said that tears rolled down his face as he began to cry . A delighted Raju appears to smile after enjoying his first meal after being freed. The charity believes that the elephant had a total of 27 owners after being poached as a calf . 'By the time we found him in July 2013 he was in a pathetic condition. He had no shelter for him at night, and was being used as a prop to beg from dawn until dusk from tourists visiting the sites of India. 'He hadn't been fed properly and tourists started giving him sweet food items and because he was in a state of hunger and exhaustion he began eating plastic and paper. 'It took us 45 minutes to remove the shackles that had torn into the flesh on his legs for the past 50 years – and act of unthinkable cruelty. And it was when he was finally freed that tears gushed down his face. I'd never seen anything like it in my life. 'His legs were so covered in absesses and his feet so damaged by walking on hard tarmac roads, that we have spent £40,000 so far on his medical treatment, and we still have a long way to go as he has a serious limp and open wounds. 'Pain and brutality were all he knew. His cruel handler even tore out the hair from his tail to sell as good luck charms. The exploitation and abuse just had to stop.' Now the charity has launched a Christmas campaign to save the last 67 performing circus elephants in India to join the charity's herd of hope. The charity has so far spent £40,000 on the elephant's medical treatment so far and he is still suffering from open wounds and a serious limp . After his release, Raju was taken to Wildlife SOS's sanctuary. The organisation is also planning to rescue another elephant from its abusive owner . Mr Satyanarayan added: 'Raju and our herd of hope are the lucky ones. But there are 67 performing elephants in India – many of which suffer daily beatings in order to make them perform. 'We're already planning our next rescue – the desperate case of a blind elephant who is forced to perform even though she can't see for crowds. It's a pitiful case and we need to free her so she can join Raju. 'Now the public can help him live out a dignified life in peace with even a small donation,' Mr said Kartick, whose charity is dependent on public donations. 'All these elephants have known from human beings is pain and suffering – now we're asking to help us help him live out their days, with grass under their feet – free from humiliation and pain.'

"A dedicated teenager has finished his education without ever having a day off school. Callum Rollinson, 16, of Hull, has turned up to school every day since he was four all thanks to his good health. But even if he'd wanted to take a cheeky sick day, he would have found it difficult to fool his mother Tina - a teacher. While most teens will try and get away a day in bed if they can manage it, Callum decided to try and hang onto his record after his primary school noticed his perfect attendance when he was just 11. Dedicated: Callum Rollinson and his mother Tina. The teenager has finished his education without ever having a day off schooll . It became a running joke for his mother, father Tony and brother Josh, 21, who warned him he could never take a day off. The Year 11 pupil is about to sit his GCSEs at Cottingham High School in Hull before starting an engineering apprenticeship, where he hopes to keep up the record.  Callum said: 'I've always really liked school. Callum decided to try and hang onto his record after his primary school noticed his perfect attendance when he was just 11 . 'But it is an achievement and something I'm proud of because not many kids can say they've done it. 'It's just down to me not being ill on school days.' I knew I was going to try to not have a day off, so even if I did feel a little ill, I would always go in. 'My mum wouldn't let me stay at home for nothing. She has definitely had something to do with it, she has always pushed me to go to school. 'It has definitely helped me with my school work because I have been to all my lessons so I have learned more. It proves I am dedicated to something.' 'Going to school is something that has taken up the majority of my life, so it shows I am capable of sticking to something.  'It looks great on my CV and I think it definitely helped me get my apprenticeship.' Mrs Rollinson, a college teacher, said Callum had never even tried to skive off. She said: 'I have heard every excuse for a day off school in my career but Callum has always just got up and gone to school. 'When he made his first year at secondary school we would say to him ""Another year down, you can't have a day off now!"" and he never asked for one. He has done really well.' 'He has a good, strong work ethic and if he can keep it up for another four years for his apprenticeship that would be amazing. We are all very proud of him.'

"A killer whale born to much hope in early September apparently died while its pod was in the open ocean off Washington or British Columbia, the Center for Whale Research said. The baby was the first known calf born since 2012 to a population of endangered orcas that frequent Puget Sound in Washington state. It has not been seen since its pod returned in recent days to the inland waters of western Washington, said the center's Ken Balcomb. A baby orca swims between two adults in the waters of Puget Sound near Seattle, Washington. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research believes that the baby orca apparently died while its pod was in the open ocean . 'The baby is gone,' he said Tuesday. The pod was offshore for a week to 10 days, and the orca designated L-120 might have been lost in a storm in the middle of last week, Balcomb said. The baby was a member of 'L pod,' one of three closely tracked families within the dwindling Puget Sound population. Researchers observed the pod, but not the baby, on Friday in Puget Sound, on Saturday in the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, and on Monday in Haro Strait, between San Juan Island and Victoria, British Columbia. 'The mother is there, aunt's there, big brother,' Balcomb said. 'The baby didn't make it.' That leaves 78 killer whales in the Puget Sound population. Dwindling: There are just 78 killer whales in Puget Sound and it appears their numbers are declining . The newborn was spotted in the first week of September off San Juan Island. Two other whales are presumed dead after disappearing earlier this year, so the birth was hailed. 'We were being guardedly optimistic that a turning point had been reached, but that is not the case,' Balcomb said. The unique population numbered more than 140 animals decades ago but declined to a low of 71 in the 1970s, when dozens were captured for marine parks and aquariums. The orcas were listed as endangered in 2005. The striking black and white whales have come to symbolize the Pacific Northwest. Individual whales are identified by slight variations in the shape of their dorsal fins and distinctive whitish-gray patch of pigment behind the dorsal fin, called a saddle patch. The Puget Sound killer whales primarily eat fish, rather than other marine mammals. Offspring tend to stay with their mothers for life.","The Center for Whale Research has confirmed that baby L120, only about seven weeks old  was not with his or her mother .
The offspring of a 23-year-old from the Southern Resident pods was the first recorded since August 2012 ."
"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that he will soon unveil long-planned Justice Department guidance aimed at ending 'racial profiling' in U.S. police departments. Holder traveled to Atlanta to meet with law enforcement and community leaders for the first in a series of regional meetings around the country, taking place at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta – the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached. President Barack Obama had asked Holder to set up the meetings in the wake of clashes between protesters and police in Ferguson, Missouri. 'In the coming days, I will announce updated Justice Department guidance regarding profiling by federal law enforcement. This will institute rigorous new standards – and robust safeguards – to help end racial profiling, once and for all,' Holder said. 'This new guidance will codify our commitment to the very highest standards of fair and effective policing.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke, preacher-style, during an interfaith service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, the church where The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached, on Monday . Protesters were escorted out after interrupting Holder's speech . Tensions between police and the community in Ferguson boiled over into violent confrontations in August after a white police officer shot a black teenager. Protests turned violent again last week after a grand jury declined to indict officer Darren Wilson in the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Holder's meeting in Atlanta included a closed roundtable discussion with law enforcement and community leaders followed by a public interfaith service and community forum. The meeting came on the heels of  Obama's request to federal agencies Monday for recommendations to ensure the U.S. isn't building a 'militarized culture' within police departments. The White House also announced it wants more police to wear cameras that capture their interactions with civilians. The cameras are part of a $263 million spending package to help police departments improve their community relations. The selection of King's church as the site for the meeting was significant. The most successful and enduring movements for change adhere to the principles of non-aggression and nonviolence that King preached, Holder said. 'As this congregation knows better than most, peaceful protest has long been a hallmark, and a legacy, of past struggles for progress,' he said. 'This is what Dr. King taught us, half a century ago, in his eloquent words from the Ebenezer pulpit and in the vision he shared from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.' While the grand jury has made its decision, the Justice Department continues its investigation into the death of Brown and into allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department, Holder said to loud applause. Holder also told the crowd that the meetings he's convening around the country are just the beginning and that he wants to start a frank dialogue and then translate that into concrete action and results. Protesters in Atlanta remained peaceful but seemed every bit as angry as those in Ferguson, MIssouri . Civil rights activists chanted outside the church as Holder pledged to end 'racial profiling' in police departments . Holder's comments were well-received by the audience. When a group of people interrupted his speech with chants and was escorted out, Holder applauded their 'genuine expression of concern and involvement' and got a standing ovation from the crowd. Several dozen protesters chanted and waved signs referencing Ferguson outside the doors of church. Holder, who plans to leave the position once a successor is confirmed, has identified civil rights as a cornerstone priority for the Justice Department and speaks frequently about what he calls inequities in the treatment of minorities in the criminal justice system. He has targeted sentences for nonviolent drug crimes that he says are overly harsh and disproportionately affect black defendants and has promoted alternatives to prison for non-violent offenders. Holder, center, met with law enforcement and community leaders for a roundtable discussion at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on Monday, as he works to calm racial tensions in the weeks before he retires . Cynthia Winfree, of Atlanta, leaned in to listen through a window as Holder spoke to a capacity crowd . Last year, as part of the Justice Department's 'Smart on Crime' initiative, he instructed federal prosecutors to stop charging many nonviolent drug defendants with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences – punishments that he said were contributing to overcrowded prisons. The Justice Department has also broadened the criteria for inmates seeking clemency in hopes of encouraging potentially thousands more inmates to apply, and Holder backed changes in federal sentencing guideline ranges that could result in tens of thousands of drug prisoners becoming eligible for early release. Holder also has publicly discussed the need to ease tensions between police departments and minority communities. The Justice Department has also targeted flawed police departments, initiating roughly 20 investigations of local police agencies – including Ferguson 0in the past five years. A new pilot program announced weeks after the Ferguson shooting will study racial bias in American cities and recommend ways to reduce the problem. He has spoken about race in sometimes personal terms, recalling after the Ferguson shooting instances in which as a younger man he was stopped or confronted by police without cause. He has also said he understands mistrust of law enforcement in minority communities.","Outgoing attorney general spoke at the same Atlanta church where Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached .

"A star player at the high school football team caught up in a allegations of sick hazing rituals carried out on freshman has lost his scholarship to Penn State University. Myles Hartsfield, 17, a cornerback in his final year at the beleaguered Sayreville War Memorial School in Parlin, New Jersey, was dropped by coaches today. Seven players have been charged with sex crimes over allegations that older team members would routinely hold new players down, anally penetrate them with their fingers, then stick it in the boy's mouth. Promising: Myles Hartsfield, a cornerback for the scandal-hit football team at Sayreville War Memorial School in New Jersey, has lost his scholarship to Penn State University. He is pictured here earlier in his high school career . Young talent: Hartsfield, pictured in 2011, is now considered one of the most promising players in the state, and had several scholarships to choose from . It is not clear whether Hartsfield is one of the players, all aged 15-17, who have been arrested and charged. The names of those charged have not been released because they are all juveniles. The blow to Hartsfield's career was reported today by BlueWhiteIllustrated, a fan site for the Nittany Lions, Penn State's team. He has been described as an 'explosive talent' in offense and defense - and had the pick of several scholarships before choosing Penn State. According to some rankings, he is the 13th most promising player in New Jersey. 'Sick ritual': Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team, some of whose players are pictured above, has been by a hazing scandal. The identities of the players involved is not known . But he, and all his teammates, are now in jeopardy after the season was canceled while investigations take place. The scandal widened last night after the area's Superintendent revealed that the hazing may have been going on for years - and said that football may not come back to the school for a very long time. Sayreville Schools Superintendent Richard Labbe revealed that information gathered by the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Officer suggests the harassment, intimidation and bullying may have taken place before this year in the Bombers' locker room. Action: Superintendent Richard Labbe is considering banning football indefinitely at Sayreville War Memorial High School after the prosecutor said there is evidence of previous harassment, bullying and intimidation . Having already suspended the squad for a season, Labbe is now considering extending the ban into 2015 and beyond. The scandal has forced the school to call off this season's football as officials consider the future of the team, the coach and the principal. More details also emerged about the alleged incident itself - which is claimed to have required seven people at once. Four boys would pin the freshman down in the locker room, and two would stand guard. The seventh would howl, turn off the lights, then carry out the penetration, according to the new claims. Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school last week . Sayreville War Memorial High School senior Kishan Patel, 17, stops to answer questions from the media as he leaves school last week . The description of the attacks, which are alleged to have taken place almost every day from September 19 to 29, was given by an unnamed parent of a football player to NJ Advance Media on Saturday. He or she described the ritual as 'sickening'. They said: 'Just think if my son or somebody else's son wanted to leave and they either felt overwhelmed by it, [or] they couldn't leave because there was somebody at the door'. It came as the coach of the team, George Najjar, refused to answer questions to the news website about whether he would resign. He said: 'There will be a time and place when I have something to say, but now is not the time.' Three students were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children.

"Papiss Cisse was fortunate not to be substituted at half-time as Alan Pardew, fearing a second away defeat in four days, made two changes to his lacklustre side. And it is just as well he kept faith with the striker he suspects is still feeling the effects of surgery on a broken kneecap, for within three minutes of the restart he had pounced to claim a point. ‘That’s why you leave players like Papiss on, because he’s a goalscorer,’ said Pardew, whose side have lost just once in nine games and that at West Ham on Saturday.

Goals: Cisse 48 . Booked: Williamson, Tiote . Manager: Alan Pardew 6.5 . Referee: Phil Dowd 7 . Man-of-the-match: Papiss Cisse . Attendance: 18, 791 . Super stat: Papiss Cisse has scored five goals from four starts this season. ‘Papiss is Papiss, he will always sniff a chance out, he’s done that in every game he has ever played for us.’ The Senegal frontman was making his first start since November 1, absent or reduced to cameo roles from the bench in the meantime amid concerns over his fitness. And on the evidence of his first-half display — in which he lashed one chance horribly over the bar — Cisse was, as suspected, far from his sharpest. That, though, could be said of every one of his Newcastle team-mates as they entered the break trailing to George Boyd’s 34th-minute blast. Pardew said: ‘It was hard to watch that first half. They close the game down and make it hard for you. ‘I was pleased to see our fans stayed for the second half, because the last 20 minutes of the first half was tough. I wasn’t angry at half-time, I just felt we lost our verve to get on the ball. Once we did that the pitch and the game opened up. I brought some technical players on and we took risks and got our reward for it.’ The equaliser arrived when Daryl Janmaat centred from the right and Cisse stole in to hook home his fifth goal of the season. But on a night when temperatures dipped below freezing, it was £12million substitute Remy Cabella who injected the energy and invention his side had previously lacked. ‘The big difference was Cabella, who gave us technical ability,’ said Pardew. ‘You might not expect that of an eight-stone Frenchman on a cold night at Burnley, but he was excellent. ‘That’s good news because we’ve been waiting for him to come alive. He’s been a slow-burner. He took the game by the scruff of the neck. He has to be a David Silva type for us, get on the ball and run the game.’ In the end, a point proved fair for both sides and saw Burnley move out of the relegation zone.

Abeid (left) goes toe to toe with Burnley defender Stephen Ward in the early stages at Turf Moor . They took a deserved lead when Boyd fired past former school friend Rob Elliot in the Newcastle goal. Kieran Trippier loaded a ball forward from deep inside his own half, Danny Ings jumped to nod back to the feet of Boyd and he arrowed through bodies and beyond a motionless Elliot from 20 yards. It could have been two before the break had David Jones, darting into the area, not lashed wide in added-time. Burnley manager Sean Dyche said: ‘In the first half we were excellent and we had a real big chance before half-time to go in at 2-0. ‘We expected a reaction from them and we gave them that chance. It was a poor goal to concede. Afterwards we had pockets of good play but so did they, they’re a good side. ‘For all of their injuries they did quite well to bring Steven Taylor, Remy Cabella and Emmanuele Riviere on. I wish we had those options.’ He added: ‘We have to turn those “so nearly” games into three points and it’s important we just concentrate on performances rather than the league table.’ Newcastle may well have made it seven wins in eight late on with Cabella particularly impressive. The sight of their marquee summer signing finally starting to come good at the onset of winter will cheer Pardew before Saturday’s visit of league leaders Chelsea to St James’ Park.

"It was at the Hawthorns last April that West Ham fans unfurled a banner reading ‘Fat Sam Out: Killing WHU’. Eight months later, they are a happier bunch. ‘We’re gonna win the league,’ the travelling supporters sang.

Manager: Sam Allardyce 7 . Referee: Mike Jones 5 . Man of the Match: Downing . Attendance: 23,975 . West Bromwich Albion can only look over their shoulders. Alan Irvine has overseen a fourth successive loss, as the relegation places loom closer. Fan chants told his story too. ‘Taxi for Irvine,’ the home crowd shouted. They have seen their team win only three times in the Premier League this calendar year. Irvine said: ‘It’s not going to help but I can’t control that, the fans have every right to behave in every way they chose. 'I’ve said we are a lot stronger if everybody is pulling in the same direction. 'It comes with the territory. It’s not that long since Sam went through it.’ Irvine evidently lacks full confidence in his squad players to alter starting line-ups much. Summer signing Silvestre Varela was brought on in the second half for only his second appearance of the season. Striker Brown Ideye, who cost £9million, came on with six minutes to go for his first outing since late October. It is quite the opposite for Allardyce, who won here without starting Enner Valencia or the injured Diafra Sakho – two players who lit up West Ham’s opening games. Kevin Nolan scored his first goal since February on his return to the side, while James Tomkins found the winner with a header on the stroke of half-time. Craig Dawson had given Albion an early lead but the high spirits soon faded. ‘Our summer months of hard work in recruiting terms and pre season are still paying off for us,’ said Allardyce. ‘It wasn’t great but it was resilient.

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone including the move for Kevin Nolan's equaliser against West Brom . West Brom took the lead in the 10th minute when Victor Anichebe turned Tomkins and earned a free-kick on the angle of the area. Graham Dorrans whipped across a devious ball, but it was far too simple for Dawson to bound into the six-yard area, past Tomkins, and find a glancing header into the net. Given Albion’s last goal came virtue of the rather unfortunate Esteban Cambiasso in victory at Leicester, this broke a run of 370 minutes since someone on the payroll had scored. It was reward for a bright start, but near enough straight away the hosts began to sit back. West Ham needed no invitation to attack. By half-time the visitors were ahead. Nolan, at 32, is less of a fixture in Allardyce’s side than he once was but he still possesses an uncanny ability at close range. In the 35th minute Stewart Downing flung a free-kick into the area. Chris Brunt only cleared Tomkins’ header into the air and Andy Carroll connected in spectacular fashion with a bicycle kick that flew at goal. Ben Foster sprang to save but Nolan had ghosted into the six-yard box and nodded the rebound in – his first goal since February 22. On the stroke of half-time Brunt was forced off injured and West Ham went ahead. Foster pushed a shot from Cheikhou Kouyate round the post to concede a corner. Downing flighted it deep and Tomkins out-leapt Dawson to head home. A role reversal of earlier – and far too easy again. Dawson had a chance to atone seven minutes after the interval, but dragged his shot horribly wide. Then, just as they did against Arsenal, West Brom roused to rally in the final 10 minutes. Anichebe found space in the box and drove a shot at goal that Adrian saved with his legs, then Dorrans hit a volley that flashed just wide. Once again, it was too little, too late.

"UEFA has rejected appeals by Serbia and Albania after their European Championship qualifying match was abandoned when a drone flying a political banner flew into the stadium. UEFA's appeals body on Tuesday upheld the original disciplinary sanctions: Albania forfeited the match for refusing to play on, and Serbia was deducted the three points from a 3-0 win by default.

In the resulting disorder, Serbian fans attacked Albania players. Historic tensions between the countries were fuelled by Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian-dominated province, declaring independence from Serbia in 2008. UEFA also ordered Serbia to play two home qualifiers in an empty stadium. Serbia lost the first of those matches last month, 3-1 against Denmark. Their next home match in Group I is against Armenia on September 4. In the five-team group, Denmark and Portugal currently hold the two automatic qualifying places for Euro 2016 in France. Albania is in third place, which guarantees at least advancing to a playoff. The Albanians have four points from three matches, three ahead of fourth-place Serbia. The Balkan countries are scheduled for a return match in Albania next October 8. UEFA also fined both federations 100,000 Swiss Francs.

"An Egyptian court has condemned 188 people to death in the country's latest mass death sentence to be ordered in the face of widespread international criticism. The 188 were charged over the killing of 11 policemen last year in Kerdasa, a restive town west of Cairo considered a militant stronghold. The attack, in which the policemen's bodies were badly mutilated, is considered one of the country's grisliest assaults on security forces. Scroll down for video . Kerdasa descended into chaos last year when troops (pictured) stormed the area seeking those responsible for the killing of security officers . Egyptian soldiers wait for instructions as they gather in a street during an operation against gunmen in Kerdasa last year. A court has now sentenced 188 people to death for killing police officers during the unrest . The defendants also were accused of attempting to kill 10 more policemen, damaging a police station, setting police cars on fire and possessing heavy weapons. The attack happened on the same day that security forces brutally cleared two protest camps of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi's supporters, killing hundreds. Protesters were demanding the reinstatement of Morsi, who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood group. Some 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ousting, including most of the Brotherhood's top leaders, as well as large numbers of others swept up by police during pro-Morsi protests. Today's sentence requires the opinion of Egypt's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti. The court is scheduled to issue a final verdict January 24. Defendants can then appeal. Last year a judge sentenced more than 1,200 people to death, although this was later reduced to about 200. Pictured are a group of people taking shelter during the violence in Kerdasa . Egyptian soldiers take cover behind an armoured personnel carrier as they keep watch during an operation against the gunmen in Kerdasa . Security officials said 143 of the 188 defendants are in custody. Those not held will receive automatic retrials under Egyptian law. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists. Egypt has been sharply criticized for recent mass death sentences largely targeting Islamists. Earlier this year, a judge in the southern city of Minya sentenced more than 1,200 people to death in two mass trials. The number of death sentences, initially the most in recent memory anywhere in the world, was later reduced to some 200. Those cases also involve attacks on police stations and the killing of police officers following the dispersal of the protest camps.","Egyptian court has ordered killing of 188 people in mass death sentence .

"Cannibal? Arihano Haiti, 33, was found guilty of killing Stefan Ramin on Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia, and sexually assaulting his girlfriend . A South Sea Islander accused of killing and eating a German adventurer has been jailed for 28 years for murder. Arihano Haiti, 33, a registered tourist guide, was found guilty of killing Stefan Ramin on Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia, and sexually assaulting his girlfriend. A judge ruled that Haiti would have no possibility of parole until he has served at least 18 years of his near three-decade sentence. Mr Ramin, 40, and his girlfriend had been on an island hopping adventure in the South Pacific when he was killed and she was assaulted. The crime shocked the tiny island of Nuku Hiva which, with a population of just more than 2,000, was previously best known from the stories of Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick. Haiti was first arrested in 2011, amid claims that he had taking Mr Ramin hunting then killed him, carved him up and eaten parts of his body before setting fire to what remained. He then returned to where Mr Ramin's girlfriend was waiting, tied her up and sexually assaulted her. He fled when she escaped and raised the alarm, going on the run for 50 days before giving himself up. A French Polynesian court heard that investigators were unable to prove the claims of cannibalism and prosecutors accused Haiti of shooting the German man with a bullet in the head, cutting up the body and then burning it. Mr Ramin and his girlfriend had moored their Turkish-bought catamaran Baju off the coast of Nuku Hiva on September 16, as part of a planned two-year stint island hopping around Polynesia. Murder in paradise: Stefan Ramin and his girlfriend on their travels. They had been sailing around Polynesia . Mr Ramin had hired Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - to take him into the island's interior on a goat hunt. He never returned. Police say Haiti went back to the boat to try to lure Mr Ramin's girlfriend into the jungle by claiming that Mr Ramin had had an accident and needed help. Desperate claims: Haiti had claimed in his defence that he shot Mr Ramin and attacked his girlfriend because the German had sexually assaulted him . She was suspicious and refused to go with him, but he had then ended up sexually assaulting her anyway and tying her to a tree. After she escaped human and alerted authorities, Mr Ramin's burnt remains were found. Among the embers investigators found a jaw bone, teeth and melted metal - believed to be fillings. Mr Ramin, a fanatical sailor, was a former business adviser. He kept a regular blog of his trip which begun in 2008 and one of his last entries read: 'I seek freedom and adventures'. On Facebook, he listed his interests as 'travelling, blue water sailing, kiting, kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, diving... actually everything which one can do on and under the water'. Haiti had claimed in his defence that he shot Mr Ramin because the German had sexually assaulted him. After killing Mr Ramin, he said, he decided to sexually assault his girlfriend in revenge for his own assault. But detectives in Germany working together with the local investigators say they had found no evidence that the German had had any homosexual tendencies. Happy: Mr Ramin with his girlfriend. Detectives in Germany working together with the local investigators say they had found no evidence that the German had any homosexual tendencies . A lawyer for the dead man's family, Yves Pirou, said that the accused's allegations were a pure work of fiction. He said the reality was exactly the opposite and while there was no indication that the victim had any homosexual tendencies, Haiti was known to have had regular contact with transvestites and the probability is far more likely that he had raped Mr Ramin or at least tried to rape him.

"Former Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood has hit out at a section of fans campaigning for current boss Arsene Wenger to be sacked. Despite earning a hard-fought victory against West Brom on Saturday, travelling fans displayed a banner which read, 'Arsene, thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye'. The Arsenal fans may have grown tired of watching their side battle for fourth place each season, but the man who appointed Wenger 18 years ago believes calls for the Frenchman to be sacked are 'ridiculous'.

Hill-Wood told the Daily Star: 'Thoroughly ignorant people seem to have a say nowadays. 'It is a few hotheads jumping up and down thinking they are being clever. 'It is the most ridiculous way to behave really because normal people are forever saying boards act too hastily when they get rid of a manager.' Hill-Wood believes Arsenal fans shouldn't be calling for Wenger to be sacked . Despite a slow start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign, the Gunners still find themselves within two points of fourth spot, but the Emirates faithful will argue that playing for a Champions League place isn't enough. Hill-Wood added: 'Here we have a really good one with the team sixth in the league and into the last 16 of the Champions League for the 15th consecutive season . 'I don't take too much notice of it and it isn't going to influence the board, I am sure of that.'

"The majority of American presidents are forgotten in as little as 50 years, researchers have found. Researchers say that by the year 2060, American will remember Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter 'as they now remember about our 13th president, Millard Fillmore'. However, they found some presidents - including John F Kennedy and Barack Obama, could be remembered longer. Can you name the presidents in the order they served? Researchers asked college students (top) and adults (bottom) - and found only the first and last few were known - and Abraham Lincoln. In each test, participants were provided a numbered list with blank spaces and asked to fill in the names of all presidents they could remember in the order in which they served. If they could remember names but not the order, they were instructed to guess or to put the names off to the side. Thus, the results could be scored for recall of presidents with or without regard to correct order. 'By the year 2060, Americans will probably remember as much about the 39th and 40th presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, as they now remember about our 13th president, Millard Fillmore,' said Henry Roediger at Washington University in St. Louis, who co-authored the new paper. He has been testing the ability of undergraduate college students to remember the names of presidents since 1973, when he first administered the test to undergraduates while a psychology graduate student at Yale University. The current study, co-authored with Washington University graduate student K. Andrew DeSoto, compared results from the presidential-recall tests Roediger has given to three generations of undergraduate college students (1974, 1991 and 2009) and a similar test offered online to 577 adults ages 18-69 in 2014. While Roediger's early research used the presidential-recall test to study patterns of remembering and forgetting in individual test takers, the new study was able to uncover how Americans forget presidents from our historical or popular memory over time. In each test, participants were provided a numbered list with blank spaces and asked to fill in the names of all presidents they could remember in the order in which they served. If they could remember names but not the order, they were instructed to guess or to put the names off to the side. Thus, the results could be scored for recall of presidents with or without regard to correct order. The findings showed several consistent patterns in how we have forgotten past presidents and offer a formula to predict the rate at which current presidents are likely to be forgotten by future generations. From George Washington to Obama: Students were tested on their ability to recall Presidents and the order in which they served . Researchers say that by the year 2060, American will remember Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter 'as they now remember about our 13th president, Millard Fillmore'. Among the six presidents who were serving or had served most recently when the test was first given in 1973, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson and Gerald R. Ford are now fading fast from historical memory, whereas John F. Kennedy has been better retained. The study estimates that Truman will be forgotten by three-fourths of college students by 2040, 87 years after his leaving office, bringing him down to the level of presidents such as Zachary Taylor and William McKinley. How quickly presidents are forgotten: researchers created an algorithm to find out how soon they will be forgotten. The current data do not permit assessment of forgetting rates of the most recent presidents, and do not specify why some relatively recent presidents are forgotten more rapidly than others, Roediger said. 'Kennedy was president less than three years, but is today remembered much better than Lyndon Johnson,' Roediger said. 'One idea is that his assassination made him memorable, but of course that does not apply to James Garfield or William McKinley, who were also assassinated and are remembered relatively poorly. In chronological order, the Presidents of the United States are: . George Washington, 1789-1797 . John Adams, 1797-1801 . Thomas Jefferson, 1801-1809 . James Madison, 1809-1817 . James Monroe, 1817-1825 . John Quincy Adams, 1825-1829 . Andrew Jackson, 1829-1837 . Martin Van Buren, 1837-1841 . William Henry Harrison, 1841 . John Tyler, 1841-1845 . James Knox Polk, 1845-1849 . Zachary Taylor, 1849-1850 . Millard Fillmore, 1850-1853 . Franklin Pierce, 1853-1857 . James Buchanan, 1857-1861 . Abraham Lincoln, 1861-1865 . Andrew Johnson, 1865-1869 . Ulysses S. Grant, 1869-1877 . Rutherford Birchard Hayes, 1877-1881 . James Abram Garfield, 1881 . Chester Alan Arthur, 1881-1885 . Grover Cleveland, 1885-1889 . Benjamin Harrison, 1889-1893 . Grover Cleveland, 1893-1897 . William McKinley, 1897-1901 . Theodore Roosevelt, 1901-1909 . William Howard Taft, 1909-1913 . Woodrow Wilson, 1913-1921 . Warren Gamaliel Harding, 1921-1923 . Calvin Coolidge, 1923-1929 . Herbert Clark Hoover, 1929-1933 . Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1933-1945 . Harry S. Truman, 1945-1953 . Dwight David Eisenhower, 1953-1961 . John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 1961-1963 . Lyndon Baines Johnson, 1963-1969 . Richard Milhous Nixon, 1969-1974 . Gerald Rudolph Ford, 1974-1977 . James Earl Carter, Jr., 1977-1981 . Ronald Wilson Reagan, 1981-1989 . George Herbert Walker Bush, 1989-1993 . William Jefferson Clinton, 1993-2001 . George Walker Bush, 2001-2009 . Barack Hussein Obama, 2009- . 'Kennedy may be well recalled because his brothers and other family members were (and are) active in politics and help to keep his memory alive,' Roediger speculated. HIllary Clinton, if elected in 2016, has the potential to be much better remembered than her husband, because her presidency would represent a unique first in American history. Barack Obama may be well remembered for the same reason, Roediger said. The rate at which college students forgot the order of recent presidents remained remarkably consistent over time and across different groups of college students. In 1974, nearly all college students recalled Johnson and his ordinal position (36), but by 1991, the proportion remembering him dropped to 53 percent and by 2009, it plummeted to 20 percent. When asked to name the presidents in the order they served, we as a nation do fairly well at naming the last few presidents, but our recall abilities then fall off quickly, with less than 20 percent able to remember more than the last eight or nine presidents in order, the study finds. While Americans who were tested could name the nation's first president (George Washington) and do reasonably well at naming the next three or four presidents in order, the recall success rate for early presidents also drops off sharply, with fewer than 25 percent of Americans able to recall more than the first five presidents in order. 'Out of the 150 college students we tested in 2009, only four of them were able to recall virtually every president and place each in the correct position,' DeSoto said. 'It's possible that these individuals used a mnemonic like a song or rhyme that they learned for the purpose of remembering the presidents.' With a few interesting exceptions, the vast majority of presidents in the middle of pack -- from No. 8, Martin Van Buren, to No. 30, Calvin Coolidge -- already are largely forgotten by the average American, the study finds. A president to be remembered? HIllary Clinton, if elected in 2016, has the potential to be much better remembered than her husband, the researchers said,  because her presidency would represent a unique first in American history. The probability that anyone who took the test could recall both the name and the order of most presidents in this middle range is quite low, and this level of poor recall for the middle presidents has generally held true in testing across all generations for nearly four decades. A notable exception in this middle wasteland of presidential recall is Abraham Lincoln and his two immediate successors, Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant. 'Clearly, Lincoln and his successors are well remembered because of their association with the American Civil War and the ending of slavery, but it is notable that many students and adults also often know that Lincoln was the 16th president,' Roediger said. Other pre-Coolidge presidents who were remembered reasonably well in the free recall portion of the test are Theodore Roosevelt (26), William Howard Taft (27) and Woodrow Wilson (28), a showing that could be related to their favorable rankings by historians and ongoing mentions in popular culture and news media, the researchers suggest.","Students were tested on their ability to recall presidents and the order in which they served .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists he cannot play 'Fantasy Football' with his team while attempting to justify his decision to field a weakened side against Real Madrid in the Champions League. Liverpool lost 1-0 at the Bernabeu, with Rodgers making seven changes from the XI that lost to Newcastle on Saturday, including dropping Steven Gerrard, but says his job is to focus on the strength of the squad.

Rodgers also revealed Gerrard had a scan on his hamstring the day before the Madrid game, which may have influenced his decision. 'It might be hard for some people to understand because you are not privy to the information that I am. 'Steven had a scan on his hamstring on the Monday before we went. 'I put out the best team to get a result. I thought the players were magnificent. I know there has been criticism but it does the players a disservice.

He is a wonderful talent and I see all his games. 'He is a big talent and when he plays in France we get the games downloaded. 'We have to respect that he is concentrating on his club and he has an important game.'

'Chelsea have a good team,' said Toure, who was part of Arsenal's Invincibles in 2003. 'With the squad they have of course they can do it, but its not the only quality. It is about mentality.

'Every game for Liverpool you want to win and Chelsea are playing well now. When you play at home in a game like that it is going to be attacking teams. Chelsea attack and Liverpool attack as well.

"Leeds president Massimo Cellino arrived back in the United Kingdom in defiant mood on Tuesday and told the Football League it had 'made a big mistake' in disqualifying him from owning the club. Cellino was holding talks in Bahrain with the club's former owner Gulf Finance House - the investment bank still control 25 per cent of the club's shares - when the Football League announced on Monday the Italian had failed its 'owners and directors' test'. The league told Cellino he must stand down after finally receiving further evidence of dishonesty from the Italian judge who convicted him for tax evasion in March. Massimo Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park back in September . It was all quiet outside Elland Road on Monday as the statements were released . Hollywood actor Verne Troyer (centre) poses with Cellino's daughter Eleonora at Elland Road on Saturday . The 58-year-old will be entitled to return to his position at the club on March 18 next year when the conviction is spent under UK law. The league has said Cellino had 14 days to lodge an appeal. 'I don't want to spend a lot of money on lawyers,' Cellino told ITV. 'This club in the last five years has spent more money on lawyers than players.' When asked to confirm he will appeal, Cellino said: 'Sure. I'm going to meet my lawyers. They (Football League) have made a big mistake. 'They're just throwing money from the window.' Cellino took control of Leeds in April when his family company, Eleanora Sport Limited, bought 75 per cent of the club's shares from GFH. The former Cagliari owner announced a new £20million investment in Leeds on Saturday and said he had successfully negotiated a £5million contribution from GFH after meeting with the investment bank's officials in Bahrain. The statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner stands proud outside the famous old ground . Leeds' players celebrate Mirco Antenucci's strike in the 2-1 win over league leaders Derby on Saturday . We have today received a notice from the Football League disqualifying Mr Cellino from being a director of Leeds United Football Club until March 18 2015. The club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision. In the interim, the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the Football League’s Professional Conduct Committee in April 2014. The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party. Cellino added: 'I solved a big problem (on Monday) in Bahrain. It was important for the survival of this club. This club now is financially strong, it looks to the future and we're going to present the facts. 'We're going to fix the club and the league is going to realise it's doing a big mistake.' The league initially attempted to block Cellino's takeover of Leeds after his tax conviction in April, but the Italian successfully appealed. But the judge who over-ruled the league's decision, Tim Kerr QC, said if it was later concluded that Cellino had acted dishonestly when failing to pay import duty on his yacht, he would fail the 'owners' and directors' test'. Cellino faces a second similar charge of tax evasion on another yacht. The latest court case in Sardinia was adjourned in late October and it is understood a new date has yet to be confirmed. The league has also asked an independent disciplinary commission to consider whether Cellino breached league regulations by not disclosing information it had obtained from the Sardinian court which convicted him in March. Press Association Sport understands there is no time limit on the commission's findings as this further breach of its rules is an entirely separate process. It is also understood that Eleanora Sport could install a new management structure at Elland Road to satisfy the league that Cellino has no financial or executive influence on the club during his disqualification period. The Board of Directors of The Football League has, once again, considered the position of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, under its Owners' and Directors' Test. Previously (March 2014), the Board had ruled that Mr Cellino was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat (which resulted in him being fined €600,000). In April 2014, this decision was successfully appealed by Mr Cellino at a hearing of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by an independent QC (sitting alone). In reaching his verdict, Tim Kerr QC concluded that: “Mr Cellino has satisfied me that on the facts before me, what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.” Before going on to state that: “if the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses that the conduct of Mr Cellino was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would become subject to a Disqualifying Condition.” Cellino watches Leeds take on QPR back in March before his takeover had been completed . At its meeting last week, the Board considered the reasoned Judgment of the Italian Court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian Courts for its full disclosure. The Board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously (with the exception of its Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest*) that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test. Mr Cellino is entitled to appeal the Board's decision to the PCC within 14 days. As the Judgment of the Italian Court has not been published in Italy, The Football League will not make any of its contents public. Additionally, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent Football Disciplinary Commission (FDC) to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course. Editors notes: . * Shaun Harvey was Chief Executive and a Director of Leeds United between 2004 and 2013.

"'Prince George' hopped up the corridor of his palatial enclosure, clambered over a rock and went straight for a bowl writhing with his favourite meal of maggots, live worms, fly eggs and chopped fruit, drizzled with sunflower oil. 'He's a good man, his lordship' said senior Australian Fauna keeper at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, Paul Davies, 'I'm very proud of him, although he is being a bit of a pig,' Davies said as 'Prince George', a mature male Australian bilby, hoed into the worms. Davies, who is originally from Hertford, UK, and trained at London Zoo, is preparing the bilby, an endangered Australian marsupial, for the forthcoming visit to the Sydney harbourside zoo by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. 'Prince George', an endangered Australian bilby who has been 'adopted' by royal heir Prince George hoes into a favourite meal of maggots. live worms and fly eggs in the bilby enclosure at Sydney's Taronga Zoo, which has been named after the young prince, with Palace approval . Paul Davies, inside the nocturnal animal enclosure with 'Prince George', the bilby 'adopted' by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's eight-month-old son, has created a special setting of sand and rocks to emulate the desert environment in which the threatened species is found in the wild . The Palace has accepted Australia's offer to name the bilby enclosure after Prince George, and the Australian government's gift of a bilby for the young prince to 'adopt'. Taronga Zoo , which is 'incredibly proud to be part of Australia's gift to Prince George' sees the royal visit as 'a wonderful opportunity to raise awareness about Australia’s unique native animals, especially the bilby which is threatened in the wild'. Inside the nocturnal house at Taronga, where Mr Davies also works with possums, bats, gliders, rodents, owls and lizards, 'Prince George' is part of the zoo's breeding programme to increase bilby populations, which launched last year with an Australian government donation after the royal heir's birth in July. 'We tried everything with three other male bilbies, but they were too old, one of them had a bit of a limp,' said Mr Davies, who came to Australia in 1981 after working as a keeper at London Zoo and Edinburgh Zoo. 'Then we got his lordship here,' he pointed at 'Prince George', 'although there was a problem at the start.' Will Prince William take Prince George (pictured at the little prince's christening last October) to Sydney's Taronga Zoo, where an enclosure has been named after the royal heir who has 'adopted' an endangered marsupial bilby as a gift from the Australian government . Sydney's famous Taronga Zoo says it is 'incredibly proud to be part of Australia's gift to Prince George' and sees the royal visit by the Duke and Duchess of Camridge next month as 'a wonderful opportunity to raise awareness about Australia's unique native animals, especially the bilby which is threatened in the wild' ccc . Prince George, the Australian bilby who has been 'adopted' by young royal heir Prince George has been introduced to a young female bilby on Taronga Zoo's breeding programme, but has 'been quite the gentleman to date' says his keeper, Paul Davies . Endangered Australian marsupial, 'Prince George' inside Sydney's Taronga Zoo nocturnal enclosure sniffs at the hand of his keeper, British born Paul Davies, who says he has high hopes of the animal producing bilbies in the future, following next month's visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son, Prince George . The royal couple will engage in the feeding displays of tree kangaroos (left) and the giraffes (right) on their   visit to Taronga next month, on Easter Sunday . Jantan, a male orang-utan, drinks peppermint tea at Taronga Zoo which he and his partner, Willow, are served with hot meals as the weather cools down towards winter . 'Last year we put him with a female called Kirra and we tried everything, but they didn't reproduce, so we asked for a young female. 'Her name's Yajala, it means friend [in an Aboriginal language]. She's down there. That's why he keeps on taking off. She might be coming into season. 'He's sniffing at her door, although I must say 'Prince George' has been quite the gentleman to date.' As the bilby scampered away down the corridor to linger outside the darkened enclosure where the new young female bilby is 'settling in' to life at Taronga, Mr Davies explained why he had become so passionate since emigrating to Australia about a native animal most Australians had never seen. Mr Davies, who lives in Sydney with his French-born wife, Delphine, and their 13-year-old son, who is also mad about bilbies, said he had started working at Taronga a year after arriving in Australia. Set against the spectacular backdrop of Sydney harbour with its bridge Taronga Zoo is home to 4,000 animals of 350 species, including this Himalayan Tahr (above) The display by the birds of prey at Taronga (above) will be part of the zoo tour undertaken by the royal couple . 'I got my first job working on a horse stud in Queensland and when I showed them my diploma of zoo keeping from London, they just said 'put that away you Pommie bastard, we don't need to see it' and so I just worked with the horses on the farm and it was great. 'I started at Taronga and then in the nocturnal house and I just got to love bilbies. They are the most amazing little animals. 'See those ears? They're like sophisticated  air conditioning systems to help them survive in the desert, where it's hot during the day and freezing at night. 'When it’s hot, the bilbies keep their ears erect. The ears are hairless and rapidly cool the little creatures. When it’s cold, they let their ears fall against their head, almost like a little helmet, to conserve heat. 'We’ve also found they can run very quickly and when they do, the hold their white-tipped tails forwards over their heads, like a little lamp lighting their way. 'We’re getting amazing reactions from people.' Ordinary Australians will be allowed in to Taronga Zoo (above) on Easter Sunday, when the royal couple - and, perhaps Prince George - visit the bilby, enlcosure and see tree kangaroos, giraffes and birds of prey . Once he learned how fast the bilbies can move, Mr Davies set up what he jokingly calls 'the running of the bilbies', a display for visitors in which bilbies like 'Prince George' run up the corridor to a special setting of fake rocks, sand and tree stumps he has assembled between walls painted in Aboriginal colours and with the different tribal names for the creature. 'Bilbies once thrived across 70 per cent of Australia,' he said. 'These days most bilby populations are on Aboriginal land in the deserts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. 'Elsewhere they've had to compete with rabbits, feral cats and populations have declined, so we have high hopes for his lordship and our breeding programme.' It is not confirmed whether young Prince George will accompany his parents to Taronga Zoo on Easter Sunday, when the Duke and Duchess will start at the bilby enclosure, move on to feeding sessions in the tree kangaroo and giraffe enclosures, and then watch the birds of prey and other animals. 'I like the challenge of a close encounter as with animals,' Mr Davies said, 'if you get people close to an animal, you can make them aware about conservation and that is very important with our bilbies.' Mr Davies, who still has family back in Hertfordshire, says he is very happy he moved to sunny Australia but he now spends so much time in the nocturnal enclosure he has to take Vitamin D tablets to regulate his system. 'But I love my work,' he said, 'and I love getting people excited about wildlife.' Taronga director, Cameron Kerr said the zoo was part of 'a national breeding program across a number of Australian zoos and wildlife organisations that are involved in conservation, breeding and research to provide an insurance population to safeguard' bilbies into the future. 'We look forward to introducing Their Royal Highnesses to our bilbies in April,' he said.","Endangered Australian bilby 'Prince George' adopted by Prince George .

"For more stats and facts from Selhurst Park, click HERE for our brilliant Match Zone . If Paul Lambert is to quell the growing discontent among Aston Villa supporters, then he'll need Christian Benteke by his side. The Belgium international was on hand to ease the pressure on his manager on Tuesday night, scoring the winner, his first goal since March, against Crystal Palace. Benteke, making his return from a three-match suspension, is fully fit again after an achilles injury caused him to miss the back end of last season, the World Cup and the start of the current campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Stats: Crystal Palace 0-1 Aston Villa . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke wheels away in celebration after scoring against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park . Benteke scored his first goal since March against Neil Warnock's side during the first half of the Premier League clash . Eagles goalkeeper Julian Speroni dives to his left but is unable to stop Benteke's strike from going into his net . Crystal Palace (4-4-2): Speroni 6; Kelly 6 (Puncheon 89), Dann 5.5, Hangeland 6, Ward 6.5; Zaha 6, Jedinak 7, McArthur 6.5, Bolasie 6.5; Chamakh 6.5, Gayle 5 (Campbell 46).

Referee: Michael Oliver 6.5. Attendance: 23,935. 'I've been lucky enough to play with some of the best players in the world, and if he keeps progressing (Benteke can get there),' said Lambert. 'He offers you that potency in attack. He had that really bad injury, and his suspension never helped our case, but he's been excellent since he's been back.' Lambert will be hoping his talismanic striker can now stay injury - and suspension - free as he looks to keep the wolves from his door. Villa supporters have been asking real questions of Lambert; the swell of opinion for the Scot to leave is growing. And pressure from the terraces looked to be transmitting onto the field as Villa started nervously. Brad Guzan was saved by Ciaran Clark's goalline clearance after his fumble from Yannick Bolasie's shot was stabbed goalwards by Dwight Gayle. The visitor's then faced strong appeals from Palace for a penalty after Tom Cleverley tangled with Wilfried Zaha, before Gayle missed his kick after Joel Ward's inviting cross. Villa's uncomfortable start continued as Joe Cole, fresh from his first Villa goal against Burnley on Saturday, limped off in the ninth minute with a hamstring problem as the Midlanders provided nothing in the way of attacking intent inside the opening 15 minutes. However, in the 28th minute Villa provided a spark - invariably it came from Benteke, who turned Scott Dann beautifully on the edge of the area before unleashing a right foot drive that Julian Speroni tipped over the bar. There was no goal, but at least it was something; a semblance of fight from Villa. And it proved the catalyst Villa's winner four minutes later in a moment Palace defender Scott Dann will want to erase from memory. The centre half, located on the right-hand touchline, only needed to clear Martin Kelly's pass to avert any danger - instead he dallied and was robbed by Benteke, who took full advantage by striding forward before slotting past Speroni. Benteke took advantage of an error by Scott Dann to score the only goal of the match - click HERE to see more of our brilliant Match Zone . Palace midfielder James McArthur was unable to close down Benteke in time to stop the Belgium international from scoring . Guzan ensured Villa stayed in front before the break, saving from Zaha and Bolasie as Palace pressed for an equaliser before Maroaune Chamakh sent a diving header wide in the 50th minute. Had Benteke got a touch on Ashley Westwood's dangerous inswinging free-kick or Andreas Weimann finished with just Speroni to beat then the second half would have been far more comfortable for Lambert. But it was from pleasant for the Scot as Fraizer Campbell, on for Gayle at half-time, was denied a penalty after Clark looked to have pulled the striker down - much to Warnock's dismay. The Palace boss was even more bewildered when Campbell, Bolasie and Dann all failed to get a toe on Zaha's low ball across the face of goal in the final minute. 'We are looking for a player like Benteke in January, I think held Villa together tonight,' admitted Warnock. 'We should have had a penalty, though, the referee's in a bad position and didn't see Campbell was pulled back.'

"Chelsea return to Anfield on Saturday seven months after wrecking the Kop's title dream, with Jose Mourinho's players promising a lesson in how to handle the pressure of title race. A prickly media exchange between Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers, friends and colleagues turned foes, followed the clash last April when the Liverpool boss accused the Londoners of 'parking two buses' and said it was 'not difficult' to coach a team to defend in numbers. Rodgers eventually sent a conciliatory message to his former mentor, but he must have been bruised by the defeat. Perhaps, in some ways, his team are still feeling the effects. They have won only seven of 18 since. Jose Mourinho (left) and Chelsea ruined Liverpool's title dream last season in a spiky encounter . Steven Gerrard's slip allowed Demba Ba to race through and score the opening goal in a 2-0 victory . Ba's strike changed the complexion of the game and allowed Chelsea to pick Liverpool off on the counter . With the defeat Liverpool blew their big chance to win a Premier League title for the first time since 1990 . And Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic has stoked the fires again ahead of Saturday lunchtime's re-run, with an apparent jibe at Liverpool's attitude after last season's encounter. 'Nobody's happy when you lose a game and they weren't happy after that game,' said Matic. 'Many teams have tried to park the bus in front of the goal against us, but we win. It's not easy. If you defend you have to know how to defend. It was 2-0. We showed we have quality.' Liverpool were top of the Barclays Premier League in April, closing in on a first title since 1990, when Mourinho sent out a weakened team in a fixture which preceded a Champions League semi-final. It was a clash laced with enmity, with Chelsea upset the game had not been moved to help their preparations for Atletico Madrid and Rodgers angry with Mourinho's defensive tactics. This time, the Londoners are top of the league, unbeaten in 17 games this season and confident they can extend that against a Liverpool team, which has spluttered since they sold Luis Suarez. 'It is a different story,' said Matic. 'We are ready. We are first and we want to stay there. We will play a different way and I'm very happy because we will play one big game on Saturday.' Blues defender Nemanja Matic (left) has had a dig at Liverpool ahead of the meeting between the sides . Matic, celebrating with Branislav Ivanovic, heads for Anfield after scoring Chelsea's goal against Maribor . Chelsea will be full strength, without distractions. They will adopt different tactics and are determined not to stumble as Liverpool did in April. 'It was three games to go, they were fighting for the title and they wanted to win,' said Branislav Ivanovic. They struggled in a must-win. Last season was completely different. 'Now we are going there on top of the table. We know it's difficult but also our team knows how to win there. It will be very exciting. We know what we have to do. We have a lot of things to do to be successful and get points from Anfield.' 'We know what we have to do,' says Ivanovic (left) as Chelsea prepare to face Liverpool on Saturday . This is a fierce modern rivalry which first emerged from the sparring between Mourinho and Rafa Benitez a decade ago and has been well and truly reignited by that clash in April, when Chelsea's second string halted an 11-match winning streak, stunned Anfield and opened the door for Manchester City to be champions. Steven Gerrard's slip for the first goal, scored by Demba Ba, now features in a popular song and Suarez has stirred emotions by writing in his book that one Chelsea player had told him he was ashamed of Mourinho's time-wasting tactics. Ivanovic would not address the Suarez allegations when asked, after the draw in Maribor on Wednesday. Luis Suarez left a mark on last season's clash - saying one Chelsea player was ashamed of Mourinho's tactics . The atmosphere will sizzle on Saturday lunchtime. Liverpool are 12 points adrift of their visitors after 10 games but will take great satisfaction if they can end Chelsea's unbeaten start to this campaign. Complaints have been rumbling inside Stamford Bridge as Liverpool have enjoyed an extra day to recover from a European away game, when Rodgers rested first-team players in a 1-0 defeat at Real Madrid. Mourinho's squad returned from a 1-1 draw against Maribor, in Slovenia, in the early hours of Thursday morning and will fly to Merseyside after training on Friday but the players have their minds fixed on another positive result. 'It's one of the massive, crucial games for us,' said Ivanovic. 'For this kind of game you always have to find extra motivation and it's not about the tightness or fitness. 'We have two days to recover, this is usual and it's not our first time to play that. We know and we are professional, and we have to do a lot of things to be ready for that game.'

"Just when you thought it time for a period of reflection on this wonderful golfing season comes one last storyline not only intriguing in its own right but with repercussions for 2015. In Isleworth, Florida this week — yes, the place where he used to reside and where he smashed into a fire hydrant five years ago, causing his life to change irrevocably — we will witness the latest comeback of Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods makes his comeback and could offer clues as to his future at the highest level in Orlando . Past comebacks have included one from injury in 2009 and one at the Masters in 2010, when the scandalous revelations that followed his hydrant prang the previous Thanksgiving had finally died down. Back then, given the nature of the man and the fact he was relatively young, you felt sure he would find his way back to the summit, and sure enough he did. But this one has a far more uncertain feel about it. When last seen, the poor soul could barely hit a shot without yelping in agony. At the Bridgestone Invitational in August, the greatest athlete the game has seen climbed into his courtesy car with all the agility of a man in his eighties. The following week, we had the bleak pantomime of a limp-laden appearance at the PGA Championship before, thankfully, he took himself off to try to restore an acceptable modicum of fitness and health. And now, a few days shy of his 39th birthday, he’s back. Even if he is fit enough, will Woods be able to compete against the likes of Rory McIlroy? Two huge questions will dominate the landscape at the World Challenge event Tiger usually hosts in California but which has moved to the Sunshine State this year. Will he ever be fit enough to play again on a regular basis at the highest level? And, even if he is fit enough, will he be able to compete against the likes of Rory McIlroy, who will be striping the ball comfortably 40 yards past him off the tee? Neither question will be fully answered in Orlando, of course, but there will be plenty of fascinating clues. For starters, how will he swing the club under the tutelage of new coach Chris Como, whose specialist area is injury prevention? During this lost year, Woods has watched McIlroy fulfil all his awesome potential. He’s seen American golf begin the painful process of moving on and invest faith in the likes of Rickie Fowler and the impressive Jordan Spieth. American golf has invested in the likes of Rickie Fowler (above) and Jordan Spieth . Does Tiger have any relevance to this ongoing narrative, outside the usual amount of interest that will always be centred upon an athlete who has achieved so much? At Isleworth this week, let’s hope for one or two positive signs. Given the ages of the two men, wouldn’t it be truly sad if we never got to witness at least one authentic Tiger versus Rory shootout? When the pair got together for a late-night American television appearance last August, amid plenty of playful banter, Woods looked McIlroy in the eye at one point and said: ‘I’m not going to let you win a green jacket next year.’ Fingers crossed, against the likes of Graeme McDowell and current Masters champion Bubba Watson this week, Woods shows enough to suggest that, by the time McIlroy’s first tilt at a career grand slam rolls around next April, he can ignite a contest for the ages. Ryder Cup reflection is great for Christmas . Given it’s only been two months since Jamie Donaldson claimed the winning point at the Ryder Cup, you might be suspicious of any film or book detailing the ‘Glory of Gleneagles’ as being rushed out for the Christmas market. Happily, the official film that runs over two DVDs and a book proclaiming to be the ‘inside story’ are worthy testimonies to the events over that marvellous long weekend. The DVD (Lace, £15) not only brings all the main highlights but is filled with extras, including an excellent hour-long ‘Captain’s Diary,’ in which Paul McGinley goes through his week in fascinating detail. Showdown (Elliott and Thompson, £14.99), written by BBC 5 Live’s golf correspondent Iain Carter, fills in all the gaps the film format inevitably leaves — particularly when it follows the ‘official’ line. Here we find a skilful chronicle of all the drama witnessed during the year before anyone got anywhere near the venue and the incidents from Gleneagles that were left on the cutting room floor, like the fallout from Phil Mickelson’s comments about Tom Watson’s captaincy. In short, two ideal Christmas presents for the golfer you know. Quote of the week . ‘You could give me another 100 rounds today at The Australian and I wouldn’t sniff 63…. Well done Jordan Spieth, very impressive!’ Rory McIlroy, who was the defending champion, paid a warm tribute to the young American who took his title with an extraordinary, final round 63 at the Australian Open on Sunday. A number of astute judges, including former European Tour player Michael Clayton, went so far as to call it the finest round played in the tournament’s long and illustrious history.","Tiger Woods will make his latest comeback in Isleworth, Florida this week .

"Liverpool's glamour clash with Real Madrid did not turn into the nightmare some had envisaged after news of Brendan Rodgers’ dramatic team selection emerged. An intriguing 90 minutes ended, with Karim Benzema having netted the goal which separated the sides, and the game produced a number of talking points, most notably the performances of the players who Rodgers chose to go with in the Bernabeu Stadium. Here Sportsmail analyses five issues that arose during the Group B contest and looks at whether the night has the potential to be a turning point in a campaign that has stuttered and spluttered during the opening months. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle United . Karim Benzema celebrates scoring the winning goal for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu . Simon Mignolet (second left) looks dejected as Real's players congratulate Benzema after his opener . 1) Kolo Toure cannot lose his place against Chelsea . If there were fears beforehand that Toure’s presence in Liverpool’s defence would be the catalyst for a Madrid goal spree, they were soon dispelled. The Ivorian has been derided during his time on Merseyside for his tendency to make spectacular mistakes but, here, he didn’t put a foot wrong. Another big test looms against Chelsea but if Rodgers was to bring Dejan Lovren back, it would be grossly unfair. The manager may see Lovren as a future leader of his defence but the start to his Liverpool career has been underwhelming. There is reason to feel he was dropped not rested. Toure, by contrast, has not done badly when he has been called upon - apart from one aberration when conceding a penalty in the Capital One Cup defeat of Middlesbrough - and he dealt with Cristiano Ronaldo et al confidently. He deserves the chance now to shackle Diego Costa. Kolo Toure (left) holds off Karim Benzema in what was an impressive display by the Liverpool defender . Benzema (right) hurdles as he is denied by a combination of Simon Mignolet (on ground) and Kolo Toure . 2) Simon Mignolet could have turned the corner . Pressure has been building on Mignolet and if Liverpool had struck an agreement with Victor Valdes, who they had been tracking since the summer, he would have faced a major fight to preserve his status as No 1. Mignolet’s performances have been erratic, anxious even, and his failure to command the penalty area, to exude authority, have caused jitters to spread. The intensity of the Bernabeu could have tipped him over the edge but the Belgium international responded impressively. Two fine stops in the first 10 minutes from James Rodriguez and Ronaldo set him up and, for once, he looked ready to go to war with his defenders, barking his displeasure if their concentration dipped. The scrutiny will not go away but this display may bolster his fragile confidence. Simon Mingolet (centre) rises to collect a cross and deny Cristiano Ronaldo an effort at goal . The view from behind the goal as Mignolet stretches and acrobatically denies Ronaldo (left) 3) Alberto Moreno is the pick of Liverpool’s summer spending spree . There has been scrutiny on how better off Liverpool are for their heavy transfer expenditure - rightly so - but, with each game, Moreno is making his £12million acquisition look smart business. The toing and froing with Sevilla to broker a deal appears worthwhile. Back in familiar surrounds, the Spain Under-21 international was accomplished from first whistle to last, covering miles up and down the left flank. He showed discipline to stick to his task defensively but also added weight to Liverpool’s attack, delivering some fine crosses. He has been culpable for some of the goals conceded so far - think Newcastle United on Saturday and Manchester City on his debut spring to mind - but once Liverpool polish his rough edges, Moreno will be a gem. Real Madrid versus Liverpool was an occasion in which he was at home. Alberto Moreno has looked good going forward and could prove to be Rodgers' best summer signing . Moreno (right) tackles Real Madrid's Gareth Bale during the match at the Bernabeu on Tuesday . 4) Criticism of Rodgers must be given perspective . The radio phone-ins on Saturday evening made for illuminating listening. Vexed by the manner of the loss at Newcastle, a flurry of callers to 606 unleashed their fury on Rodgers and suggested his time at Anfield was up. This, of course, is the way of the modern world. Rodgers again found himself under fire for making eight changes in the Bernabeu - this observer’s view is that it was far too many and could have backfired spectacularly. He must appreciate why there was such uproar, given the fixture. It created the perception this was a distraction. High up in the stands, though, Liverpool’s travelling supporters gave frequent and noisy backing to their manager, reminding him of their affection. Rodgers must prove himself this season and show what happened in the last campaign was no fluke but Anfield’s masses have faith in his project. Liverpool fans who travelled to the Bernabeu showed support for Rodgers during the game despite changes . Rodgers roars out orders to his depleted side from his technical area at the Bernabeu . Brendan Rodgers stands stony-faced on the touchline at the Bernabeu during Liverpool's defeat . 5) Steven Gerrard’s status as one of world football’s top stars is undiminished . Rodgers had his reasons for using Gerrard from the bench but the game was poorer without his presence from the first whistle. That said, the moment he was summoned to the action produced a marvellous reaction from the home supporters. Gerrard, who had spoken warmly about Real Madrid before the first Group B game, was given a standing ovation when he entered the fray, a sign from Bernabeu regulars that they have recognised and appreciated all he has achieved through his career. Liverpool plan to open formal contract talks with him soon and Rodgers does not want to lose his captain. If, though, for some reason they carelessly allowed him to leave, plenty of top clubs would be ready to take him. Madrid’s fans showed how well he would be received in Spain.

"Sean Abbott has returned to training a week after the tragic accident which claimed the life of batsman Phillip Hughes. A bouncer delivered by Abbott struck Hughes, 25, in the back of the neck during the Sheffield Shield clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Thursday. He died surrounded in hospital by family and friends on Thursday. Abbott's team, New South Wales, rallied around each other at a training session at the SCG on Tuesday. Sean Abbott has returned to training a week after the incident which claimed life of Phillip Hughes . Abbott (centre) leaves the hospital on Thursday and is consoled by Simon Katich (left) A spokeswoman for Cricket NSW said: 'It's the whole squad that really needs everyone's support. 'We want to keep supporting them as a group there were a lot of Phillip's friends in the team.' The team will fly together to Macksville, Hughes' hometown on the NSW north coast, on Wednesday morning and return Thursday. The Sydney Cricket Ground will also be open to the public on Tuesday for the wider community to join celebrations of Hughes' life. As Macksville readies for an influx of 5000 mourners, a member of Hughes' family told Daily Mail Australia they were planning to console Abbott. 'We can't wait to see Sean Abbott tomorrow and give him a big kiss and hug,' the family member said. 'We just want to tell him it was freak accident and he cannot think he had anything to do with it. 'No one is blaming him. We want to hug him and tell him that everything is OK.' Last week, friends and mentors at the Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-western Sydney institution where Abbott grew up belting balls, joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming-cricketer. The 22-year-old seamer Abbott delivered the ball that felled Hughes last Tuesday afternoon . When one of Abbott's team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK, they said. Ian Chatman, who managed Abbott's junior team for about eight years and witnessed his first century, told Daily Mail Australia he was a grounded young man who was 'loved by everyone, and still is.' 'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by last Tuesday's events. Australian skipper Michael Clarke posted this tribute to his 'little brother' Hughes on Instagram this week . 'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, ""Don't worry about it, it's okay"".' Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke both consoled the devastated cricketer in the immediate aftermath of his friend's death. And they were far from alone. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten both spoke in support of the struggling cricketer. Former Australian national Test captain Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'.

Sickening: Images purportedly taken in the central square of the extremists' de facto capital Raqqa show the battered and bloodstained body of an unnamed 17-year-old boy strapped to a cross . The image of the murdered teenager appeared on a social media account of an activist group known as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. The group is made up of a handful of incredibly brave individuals who oppose ISIS and - despite the city being the group's de facto, the centre of its leadership and full of  bloodthirsty religious police - attempt to document the violence the terrorists group has brought to their hometown. The image has been circulated on Twitter both by anti-ISIS campaigners and by ISIS supporters, who sickeningly trumpet it as a positive example of the group's brutal interpretation of Islam. Charlie Winter, programs officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said crucifixion is a prescribed punishment meted out by Isis for specific crimes. 'Crucifixion has been used many times before – it's an age-old punishment dealt out to people who have committed treason,' he told The Independent. Horror: Raqqa's central square has been bathed in blood since the terror group fully seized control of the city earlier in the year . The Islamic State's use of crucifixion as a punishment stems from its fundamentalist interpretation of Verse 33 of the fifth book of the Koran. The verse reads: 'Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land.' 'That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.' Despite this, ISIS chooses to ignore the next passage which emphasises forgiveness and removes the imperative to use such a punishment, saying: 'Except for those who return [repenting] before you apprehend them. And know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.' Raqqa's central square has been bathed in blood since the terror group fully seized control of the city earlier in the year. Severed heads are regularly displayed impaled on spikes surrounding a small patch of grass in the square, and there are a number of wooden and metal crosses standing ready for the next execution. Islamic State militants have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government. The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court. One of the men was successfully tried on charges of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money', while the second man was convicted of 'spying and embezzlement', with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of Al-Bukamal, which is on the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq. Terrorists: Islamic State militants have publicly executed two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government . News of the executions came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring violence in Syria using sources on the ground. The first man, they said, was convicted of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury. The second militants was accused of 'dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,' according to the Observatory. The use of the phrase 'electronic chips' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside ISIS-held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants. The devices can then provide Syrian regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid.","Images shows the unnamed teenager being crucified in central Raqqa .

"We’re a week on now from the accident that left a cricketer dead and a sport in mourning. It’s too early to know what happens next. Emotions are raw, and the uncertainty over the dates for the Australia-India series reflected the sense that the sport had to go on – though no one could really say quite how, where or when. Playing cricket feels like an utterly inadequate response to the death of Phillip Hughes. But it also feels like the only response. There are no answers lurking within the next batch of runs or wickets. Perhaps there is a little solace. A tribute to Phillip Hughes attached to a fence of a car dealership in his hometown of Macksville . Mourners lay flowers at a tribute to Hughes in the town on New South Wales's mid-north coast . A cricket bat with the message 'R.I.P. Phil' and with green and gold ribbons attached hangs by a sports field . Cricket has stared deep into its own soul these past few days and been confused by what it has seen. Are helmets safe? Should we ban the bouncer? How can an innings end like this? The idea that reality has intruded on the idyll has been disquieting – though there has rarely been anything idyllic about standing 20 yards away from a man hurling a hard ball at you. As if to remind us that cricket can be perilous, the Hughes tragedy was followed quickly by the death of Hillel Oscar, an Israeli umpire who was struck in the neck out in the middle. Truly, the cosmos is in a dark mood. For more musings on England’s tour of Sri Lanka and other matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter @the_topspin. What can cricket do, if it can do anything at all? It can accept, finally, that it is only a game, not a higher calling, not a test of manhood, not a cookie jar for the spivs and the suits. It can cling on to, and bottle, the sense of togetherness that might just have helped those who knew Hughes best make some sense of their loss. Without realising it, we may even have stumbled across a convincing definition of cricket’s fabled spirit. Though cricket told itself otherwise, it never was a question of whether a bowler runs out a batsman for backing up too far, or a fielder claims a catch on the bounce. Alastair Cook (right) put the game of cricket into perspective following the death of Hughes (left) Australia captain Michael Clarke wept at a press conference in Sydney when talking about his good friend . It was always about the sense of community, from Manchester via Multan to Macksville. Even as cricket sheds tears, it has grown stronger. Above all, it can help us to be kinder. When Pakistan’s Asad Shafiq was dismissed for a carefree but futile 137 on the final afternoon of the Sharjah Test on Sunday, New Zealand’s Kane Williamson ran 30 or 40 yards to shake his hand. Throughout that Test, wickets and hundreds inspired only muted celebrations. The tragic context should not distract us from the gut feeling that cricket is a better sport when it is played like this. Mutual respect can extend beyond the days of grief. Pakistan batsman Asad Shafiq hit a brilliant 137 against New Zealand in a timely reminder of cricket's spirit . A teacher watches children play cricket at the Macksville Adventist School on Tuesday . Here in Sri Lanka, we’re all doing our best to get worked up about another one-day blowout by England, but hearts are not in it. To judge from his demeanour about the place, Alastair Cook – an old hand at smiling politely in the face of vitriol – is being true to the words he spoke ahead of last Saturday’s game in Colombo. Talking on the morning after Hughes’s death, Cook said: ‘What’s happened in the last three days has certainly clarified in my mind that’s it just a game of sport. We are incredibly lucky to play the game. But it’s just a game of sport. We have a massive responsibility to play it the right way.’ Cook shouldn’t be in England’s one-day team, let alone captaining it. But he’s got his priorities right, and it’s hard not to like him for that. (Incidentally, it has been suggested that Cook used Hughes’s death as some kind of excuse for England’s performance on Saturday. He absolutely did not.) Cricket’s task, too, is to get its priorities right. It doesn’t matter enough for grown men to be snarling at each other, but it does matter enough for our administrators to get their act together. The sport needs cherishing and protecting, and it ought to start immediately. Phillip Hughes is no more. But his legacy can last for ever. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . All hail the Kiwis… . Brendon McCullum said he felt 'pretty empty' after steering New Zealand to a famous win in Sharjah over the weekend: events elsewhere had put the third Test against Pakistan into its proper perspective. But no-one would begrudge him some quiet satisfaction about the progress his side have made. Their 1-1 draw in the UAE – in a country where both England and Australia have been thrashed – means New Zealand are unbeaten in five Test series stretching back to their loss in England in 2013. Almost as startling, they are now only a couple of points away from relegating India to seventh in the ICC rankings. Compare and contrast the raw cricketing materials at the disposal of those two nations, and you get sense of New Zealand’s achievement. They have become one of the most watchable sides in the game. The brilliant Brendon McCullum bats during New Zeland's victory against Pakistan in the UAE . … and their captain . A fair chunk of this is down to McCullum himself. This year alone, he has compiled Test scores of 224, 302 (both against India) and 202. He has done it while shifting between the middle order and the opener’s role, and while reinventing himself as a cover fielder. Gloriously, his fourth-best Test score in 2014 is 45. It may just be the most ruthless conversion-rate in history. Nothing to see here: Pt XXVIII . As the lawyers of ICC chairman N Srinivasan continue to fight for their client’s reputation in India’s Supreme Court, it was instructive to learn of Srini’s thoughts on the investigation into corruption at the 2013 IPL and the inner workings of Indian cricket. Asked if he felt this long-running fiasco had affected the image of the sport in India, the man formerly known as the president of the BCCI is reported to have said: ‘I don’t agree that Indian cricket is taking a hit, I am not able to share your sentiments on that.’ What, one wonders, constitutes a ‘hit’ in the weird and wonderful world of Narayanaswami Srinivasan? RIP Phillip Hughes . I only interviewed him once, on a quiet morning at The Oval in 2009, the day after he had made 195 for Middlesex against Surrey in the Championship. The game was still going on, and later that day Hughes would hit 57 off 46 balls. Middlesex finished nine down and two runs short of their target of 186 in 25 overs. He was the talk of the town. Phillip Hughes celebrated an outstanding century for Middlesex against Surrey at The Oval in 2009 . Hughes didn’t have to turn up early to chat to a journalist he’d never met, especially in the middle of a game. But he was there at the appointed time. English cricketers can be guilty of over-analysis. It struck me there was little danger of Hughes doing the same. ‘There’s been a fair bit of talk about my technique, but I just want to stick to my own gameplan,’ he said, as if the alternative would have been an affront. ‘It’s how I play. Everyone has their own style and that’s something I just want to keep going. Sure, bowlers will have their plans, but you can look at it in two different ways: I have my plans too. We’ll just go from there.’ In five innings for Middlesex that summer before he joined the Ashes tour, Hughes scored 574 runs at an average of 143. People were scoffing at his technique, but he did it his way and appeared to love every minute. There’s a lesson in there somewhere.","Phillip Hughes died after being struck by a bouncer one week ago .

"His artist’s eye must have found the scene irresistible. The abbey ruins in the distance were bathed in the setting sun and the stony heath where he stood with his easel was lush with the green of twisted holly oaks. If only Vincent Van Gogh had been happy enough with his painting that day to have signed it. But the grand Dutch master never liked the result of this particular excursion to the French countryside, and never put his name to it. Return of the vanished Van Gogh: Museum director Axel Ruger described the discovery as a 'once-in-a-lifetime experience' at an unveiling of the masterpiece . 'Sunset at Montmajour': It is the first full-size canvas by the Dutch master discovered since 1928. The museum said the painting belongs to an unidentified private collector and will be on display at the museum from September 24 . Yesterday – after being branded a fake, . dumped in an attic and hidden from public view for more than a century – . the oil on canvas was finally hailed as a masterpiece. Researchers . linked ‘Sunset at Montmajour’  to Van Gogh’s hand-written musings about . what he did that day in the summer of 1888 – and used 21st century . technology to confirm the painting’s authenticity. Now . the long-lost work is to go on show as the first full-size Van Gogh to . emerge for 85 years. If it is ever offered for sale it is likely to . attract bids in the tens of millions. The . landscape was painted on July 4, 1888, and mentioned the next day in a . letter the artist wrote to his brother Theo. He described the scene but . expressed disappointment at the painting, saying: ‘It was well below . what I’d wished to do.' Van . Gogh, who struggled with bouts of mental illness, was often highly . critical of his own work, including some of his most famous, such as . ‘Starry Night’, which he painted the following year. After . he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1890, ‘Sunset…’ was . listed by number in Theo’s collection. It was bought about 20 years . later by Norwegian industrialist Christian Mustad. But Mustad appears to . have been told it was a forgery, or at least wrongly attributed – so he . banished it to the attic. Van Gogh Museum director Axel Ruger, left, and senior researcher Louis van Tilborgh, right, unveiled the newly discovered 'Sunset at Montmajour' by Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh during a press conference at the museum in Amsterdam, today . First public viewing: Members of the press got their first glimpse of the newest Van Gogh discovery - a scene from near the artist's home at the time in Arles, France . In . 1991, the anonymous owners of the painting contacted the Van Gogh . Museum in Amsterdam for its opinion - but experts rejected it, partly . because it was unsigned. Yesterday the same museum announced that an intensive, two-year investigation . had concluded it was genuine after all. Chemical analysis of paint . pigments showed them to be identical to those Van Gogh used, and x-ray . examination of the canvas matched it to other paintings he did the same . month. Unveiling . the privately-owned work before it goes on show for a year, museum . director Axel Rueger described the discovery as ‘a once in a lifetime . experience’. It was a . painting from a time that many considered to be ‘the culmination of his . achievement’, he said. In the same period while living in in Arles, . Provence, he painted ‘The Yellow House’, ‘The Bedroom’ and many of his . most famous ‘Sunflowers’ series. Van . Gogh sold only one painting while he was alive and his work was only . beginning to win acclaim when he died. Today he is one of the world’s . most celebrated artists and his paintings are among the most sought . after on the rare occasions they appear at auction. In . 1987, ‘Vase With Fifteen Sunflowers’ sold for nearly £25million. When . he painted that one, however, he took the trouble to sign it. A world of brilliant colour: Van Gogh painted this self-portrait in 1887 . Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter whose work is most renowned for its bold colours, strong and heavy brush strokes and rough beauty. In his youth he worked as an art dealer in London, Paris and the Hague. He was also a teacher in England and later he worked as a missionary in Belgium, where he would sketch people from the mining community. From a young age, Van Gogh showed a flare for drawing but it wasn't until he was in his late 20s that he began painting professionally. His first major work was completed in 1885, titled 'The Potato Eaters'. A year later he moved to Paris and lived with his brother Theo, where he became immersed in the world of the French impressionists. He met and mingled with other like-minded artists at Cormon's studio, including British-Australian artist John Peter Russell, Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Towards the end of his time in Paris, he becamse friends with Peter Gauguin, who was new to the city and soon after, Van Gogh organised a joint exhibition with Gaugiun and others at an exclusive new resaurant. Works by Van Gogh, Gauguin, Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec all featured at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, in Montmartre. Bernard wrote of the event: 'On the avenue de Clichy a new restaurant was opened. Vincent used to eat there. He proposed to the manager that an exhibition be held there .... Canvases by Anquetin, by Lautrec, by Koning ...filled the hall.... 'It really had the impact of something new; it was more modern than anything that was made in Paris at that moment' After a two-year stint in the city, Van Gogh moved to the south of France where, surrounded by vibrant colours and beautiful light his palette took on a more vivid shade. It was during his stay in Arles, in the south west of the country, from 1888-1889, that his most recognisable style was developed. Sunflowers became the subject matter synonymous with Van Gogh . He frequently painted self portraits, landscapes and still lifes. But perhaps his most famous subject matter were sunflowers in a vase. In preparation for a visit from his friend Gauguin, Van Gogh painted a new sunflowers piece especially. He wanted the two to live and work together. The Frenchman stayed several months but their relationship deteriorated. Van Gogh found Gauguin dominating and felt frustrated he was not treated like an equal. After an argument, Van Gogh stormed out to a brothel with a razor blade and sliced off part of his ear. While in hospital, Gauguin returned to Paris. In the last months of his life, the artists grew increasingly troubled and by early 1890, was struggling to work. He had been plagued by mental health problems throughout his life and suffered agonising depression, loneliness and self-doubt as well as episodes of hallucination. At the age of 37, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest. Experts still speculate over the incident as the gun, a revolver, was never found. However, the wound was to prove fatal and the artist died with his beloved brother Theo at his side. Van Gogh had created more than 2,100 artworks in his short life but had only sold one painting. In the wake of his death, interest exploded. Memorial shows were held around the world and his work exchanged hands for vast sums of money. He is now recognised as one of the greatest artists of all time and his paintings sell for millions.","'Sunset at Montmajour' was previously rejected as a fake because it does not have a signature .

"Scientists have sequenced the oldest complete human genome. The DNA comes from an anatomically modern man who roamed Western Siberia 45,000 years ago. It provides experts with a more accurate timeline of  when modern humans mated with their Neanderthal cousins as they moved from Africa into Europe, between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago. Scientists have sequenced the oldest complete human genome. The DNA comes from an anatomically modern man who roamed Western Siberia 45,000 years ago. His remains were fund near the settlement of Ust’-Ishim in western Siberia in 2008. A view of the river Irtysh and the village is pictured . The male lived around the time the populations of Europe and Asia divided. His remains were found near the small village of Ust’-Ishim in western Siberia in 2008 when an ivory hunter looking for mammoth tusks stumbled across the bones on the banks of the River Irtysh. They are believed to represent the oldest radiocarbon-dated modern human outside Africa and the Middle East, according to the study in Nature. Dr Janet Kelso, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, retrieved DNA from the man’s thighbone. By studying the make-up of the man's DNA, scientists discovered that the male lived around the time the populations of Europe and Asia divided. A map of Pleistocene fossils showing nuclear DNA is pictured. The orange dots indicate Neanderthals, blue Denisovans and green, modern humans . The relatively complete human femur was discovered on the banks of the river Irtysh near the village of Ust’-Ishim in western Siberia in 2008. Radiocarbon dating of the bone showed it to be about 45,000 years old. ‘The morphology of the bone suggests that it is an early modern human; that is an individual related to populations that are the direct ancestors of people alive today’ said Bence Viola, the anthropologist who analysed it.. ‘This individual is one of the oldest modern humans found outside the Middle East and Africa.' Together with colleagues, she then sequenced and analysed the genome of the individual and found he had a similar level of Neanderthal ancestry as contemporary East Asians and Europeans. Their study, led by Svante Pääbo, suggests that Neanderthal genes flowed into his ancestors 7,000 to 13,000 years before he lived. Experts previously thought that interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals occurred anywhere between 37,000 and 86,000 years ago. The new study narrows down this huge window of opportunity to between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, which coincides with the expansion of modern humans into Europe, and possibly Asia. This was decided by studying the segments of Neanderthal DNA in his genome, which were much longer than the ones found in present-day humans. More complex than a simple march of progress: The study suggests that interbreeding between anatomically modern humans (illustrated right) and Neanderthals occurred between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, coinciding with the expansion of modern humans into Europe . ‘We present the high-quality genome sequence of a 45,000 year-old modern human male from Siberia,’ Dr Kelso said. ‘This individual derives from a population that lived before - or simultaneously with - the separation of the populations in western and eastern Eurasia and carries a similar amount of Neanderthal ancestry as present-day Eurasians.’ Chemical ratios in the bone indicated the man would have lived on berries, nuts, vegetables, meat and fish. She added: ‘Interestingly the Ust-Ushim individual probably lived during a warm period that has been proposed to be a time of expansion of modern humans into Europe.’ Scientists sequenced the oldest complete human genome from a thigh bone of an anatomically modern male, found to be 45,000 years old. They compared it to the genomes of present-day humans from more than 50 populations. They found that the Ust’-Ishim bone comes from a male individual who is more related to present-day people outside Africa than to Africans, showing that he is an early representative of the modern population that left Africa. When his genome was compared to people outside Africa, he was found to be approximately equally related to people in East Asia and people that lived in Europe during the Stone Age. Svante Pääbo explained: ‘The population to which the Ust’-Ishim individual belonged may have split from the ancestors of present-day West Eurasian and East Eurasian populations before, or at about the same time, when these two first split from each other. ‘It is very satisfying that we now have a good genome not only from Neanderthals and Denisovans, but also from a very early modern human.’ Paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin, who was involved in the study, said: ‘It is possible that the Ust’-Ishim individual belonged to a population of early migrants into Europe and Central Asia, who failed to leave descendants among present-day populations’. The experts found that about two per cent of his DNA came from Neanderthals – similar to the proportion found in present-day East Asians and Europeans.","Genome provides experts with a more accurate window into exactly when modern humans mated with their Neanderthal cousins .

Henry has announced his departure from Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls . 1994-1999: Monaco (105 lg apps, 20 gls) 1999-1999: Juventus (16, 3) 1999-2007: Arsenal (254, 174) 2007-2010: Barcelona (80, 35) 2010-2014: New York Red Bulls (122, 51) 2012-2012: Arsenal (loan) (4, 1) 1997-2010: France (123, 51) Monaco: Ligue 1, Trophee des champions . Arsenal: Premier League (2), FA Cup (3), Community Shield (2) Barcelona: La Liga (2), Copa del Rey, Supercopa de Espana, Champions League, Super Cup,  Club World Cup . New York Red Bulls: MLS Eastern Conference (2), Supporters' Shield . France: 1998 World Cup, Euro 2000, Confederations Cup 2003 . It has not happened yet, but after Thierry Henry announced the end of his playing career with New York Red Bulls this week, the flying Frenchman dropped a huge hint that he would like to come back to work with the Gunners and his mentor Arsene Wenger again. This is fantastic news for Arsenal fans. We still hold Henry in our hearts as one of the greatest Gunners ever. Unlike some players, there is no animosity at all about his decision to leave. At the time there was some doubt about the manager’s future as David Dein had left but it was clear when he came back on loan in 2012 that he was still loved unanimously by the Arsenal fans. His winning goal in an FA Cup game against Leeds in his first game back was one of the best moments I can remember. And of course his 30 Premier League goals that spearheaded the Gunners’ famous 'invincible' season will always be one of the greatest achievements of any player and club anywhere. Little wonder Henry is one of only three players, with Tony Adams and Dennis Bergkamp, to have a statue outside the ground. Arsene Wenger believes Henry will make a return to Arsenal in the future . It was not just his success on the pitch. The success he helped Arsenal achieve in his eight seasons with us makes him so loved by Gooners. The way Henry played, with style, panache, pace, verve and Va Va Voom, epitomises the football that we have become famous for under Wenger. Henry was a true entertainer and was worth the ticket price on his own. At the same time as he called time on his time with the MLS club, which almost certainly means the end of his playing days, the 37-year old changed the picture on his Twitter page to one of the Emirates Stadium. Henry won two Premier League titles and three FA Cups during his time in north London . Henry changed his cover photo on Twitter to an image of the Emirates following his announcement . So while our all-time record goal scorer takes a few weeks to consider his options and think about what to do now, it seems clear that a return to north London is in the forefront of his mind. We already knew that Arsenal was the club in Henry’s heart, as he has made no secret of it since moving to Barcelona back in 2007. And Wenger has also stated that he expects Henry to come back to Arsenal one day, although he also said that our former star needs to have a real job at the club instead of being merely a figurehead. Henry spreads his arms wide and celebrates to the Arsenal fans after scoring against Inter Milan . That would definitely suit the fans, who would love to see Henry working with either the first team or the academy players. Not only does he have an obvious passion for the Gunners, his career shows that he loves the game and with his intelligence, that would surely make him a fantastic coach and role model. Whether Henry has it in him to one day become a top class manager remains to be seen, but the idea of Wenger’s greatest success as a coach taking his place in charge of Arsenal one day is a dream situation for us Gooners.

"Former Illinois Democratic Rep. Mel Reynolds was arrested Monday in Zimbabwe after police learned that he was making pornographic films in hotels where he had accumulated $24,500 in unpaid bills, and that he had overstayed his visa by two months. A former Reynolds assistant told the state-controlled newspaper The Herald that the Democratic pol had been paying a model and several other girls to produce his pornos. 'His travel documents were not up to date and he used to bring beautiful women at different times,' said the former employee, identified only as Sunny. 'He employed five of us including a personal assistant and a driver.' The Herald also reported that Reynolds had made more than 100 dirty movies and shot some 1,000 nude photos of at least 10 women. Mere possession of pornographic material is a crime in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean immigration officials say former Democratic Congressman Mel Reynolds has been arrested for allegedly possessing pornographic material that he produced, and for violating immigration laws . The Bronte Garden Hotel in Harare, Zimbabwe was the site of Reynolds' arrest and one of the places where he allegedly made his dirty movies . Reynolds created a media frenzy in 1995 when he was charged with having sex with an underage campaign worker, asking her to obtain child pornography for him, and then having her sign false affidavits recanting the accusations . Reynolds, once a Rhodes scholar and a close confidante of Rev. Jesse Jackson, resigned in disgrace after two years in Congress when he was convicted of 12 counts of statutory rape, solicitation of child pornography and obstruction of justice. He was found guilty in 1995 of having sex with a 16-year-old campaign worker. Police ran a sting against the congressman when his mistress, who was too young to vote, told her next-door neighbor about the sexual relationship. That neighbor was a Chicago police officer. In later taped phone conversations, the teen promised him a three-way sex romp with a 15-year-old Catholic schoolgirl. 'Did I win the Lotto?' Reynolds was heard exclaiming on tape. While serving a five-year prison sentence, the disgraced Reynolds was convicted on unrelated bank fraud charges in 1997, including lying to Securities and Exchange Commission investigators. He received another six and a half years, but President Bill Clinton later commuted his sentence when he still had three years left to serve. Democrat Jesse Jackson Jr., left, replaced Mel Reynolds in Congress and then won 88 per cent of the vote when Reynolds challenged him after his release from prison. But Jackson Jr., the son of Rev. Jesse Jackson (R), went to prison in 2013 for using campaign donations to fund his lavish lifestyle . Harare, Zimbabwe has struggled since the nation's currency collapsed in 2008 following an absurd inflation rate of 230 million per cent. The country now has no national currency, and is just beginning to bring in foreign capital, an opportunity Reynolds appears to have grabbed with a group of hotel investors . Reynolds tried to return to Congress in 2004, losing in a landslide to Jesse Jackson Jr. – the man who had replaced him in a special election. Jackson Jr. would go to prison himself in 2013 for skimming campaign donations to fund a lavish lifestyle. Jackson, the son of Rev. Jesse Jackson, was a national co-chair of Barack Obama's first presidential campaign in 2008. It was Reynolds' trysts with the 16-year-old campaign aide that opened up Barack Obama's first opportunity to enter politics. Following the Congressman's indictment, state Senator Alice Palmer leaped forward to challenge him in a Democratic primary. Obama immediately put his name forward to win the open state legislative post, starting his meteoric rise to the White House. A friend from Obama's community organizing days had been Palmer's campaign manager, and made an introduction. Small world: Law professor Barack Obama began his political life when an Illinois state senator left her seat open by running to replace Reynolds after his resignation from Congress . Reynolds complained Monday that the immigration police who arrested him refused him access to the U.S. Embassy. 'They denied me my passport so that I can contact the United States Embassy which is a violation of international laws,' he said. 'It's the way it is,' Reynolds added, defending himself and suggesting that he was the victim of a scheme to embarrass him. 'I have been in this country 17 times where I have done a lot of work for the people including the fight against sanctions,' he insisted. But a source told The Herald that Reynolds had received a 14-day visa on November 13, 2013. He renewed it, said the source, but it expired again on December 10: 'He has been in the country illegally all along.' Some of Reynolds work in Zimbabwe includes work as a middle-man for investors who bankrolled a $145 million Hilton hotel and a related office complex that is scheduled to begin construction in April.","Mel Reynolds was allegedly in the country illegally since December, making pornographic films in hotel rooms with at least 10 models .

"Craig Hignett’s shock exit from Middlesbrough was triggered by a post-match fallout with manager Aitor Karanka, Sportsmail understands. The Spanish boss was sent off by referee Mark Clattenburg in the wake of Blackburn’s controversial 95th-minute equaliser during Saturday's 1-1 draw at the Riverside Stadium and has since been charged with misconduct by the FA. Karanka – who it is claimed pushed the fourth official during his protest - felt that assistant Hignett did not support him enough over the incident and words were exchanged. Hignett (left) points at the fourth official as Karanka (right) is sent to the stands on Saturday . Chris Brown challenges goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos (in yellow) in the incident which incensed Karanka . What a difference a few days can make. On Saturday, Karanka and Hignett appeared on the BBC's Football Focus together and sang each other's praises... Hignett on Karanka: 'Aitor wanted someone who knew the club, who knew the fans, who knew the league, who could help him with things that perhaps he didn't know about.' Karanka on Hignett: 'When we played against Rotherham I didn't know the team, I didn't know the players. I didn't know a lot of things and he is the person who helps me with these kind of things. He helps with training sessions and he is very, very important for me.' That led to Tuesday’s surprise news that the popular former Boro midfielder – who was not with Karanka and his backroom team at Sunday’s North East Football Writers’ Awards - would be leaving his position with immediate effect. A club statement read: ‘Following discussions between Craig, head coach Aitor Karanka, and the club, all parties have agreed for Craig to leave his position with immediate effect. ‘The club would like to place on record its thanks for Craig’s efforts since joining us from Hartlepool last season and wish him all the best for the future.’ Karanka was furious that Clattenburg allowed Rudy Gestede’s last-gasp leveller to stand after what appeared a blatant foul on goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos by Chris Brown. Afterwards, the former Real Madrid defender said: ‘I don't know if I can say everything I am thinking I might have a problem (with the authorities). Hignett has left his job as Middlesbrough assistant manager with immediate effect . Hignett had been working as No 2 to former Real Madrid assistant manager Karanka (centre) ‘The first thing I want to do is apologise for my behaviour because my behaviour has been bad and Middlesbrough Football Club doesn't deserve my behaviour, so I want to apologise, but I am going to fight for this club to the last second and put in 100 per cent myself every day. ‘But it was a moment that I was very frustrated because when you are working, when you are fighting for 93, 94 minutes and you have your objective in your hand. ‘It's amazing, I can't believe my keeper is on the treatment table. Hignett (right) made more than 150 appearances for Middlesbrough between 1992 and 1998 . ‘Someone asked me if I had seen the image (replay) and I said I watched the image but I didn't need to because Dimi is on the treatment table and I don't know if he is going to play in the next game. ‘The referee, two linesman, the fourth official - everybody in the stands and on the bench could watch the foul – except those four people, that's the interesting thing for me.’ The result left Boro two points off top in fifth place. Former favourite Juninho has been mentioned as one possible successor to Hignett.","Craig Hignett has left his role as Middlesbrough assistant manager .

"Village clubs have been pushed off a former barracks they used as a meeting place – for the Libyan army. Bassingbourn Barracks has hosted cadet groups, a golf club and a winter sports club since the last British soldiers left it last year. But the site is now set to host 2,000 Libyan troops for training before they are deployed back to the post-Gaddafi country. Quiet: Bassingbourn in Cambridgeshire usually only hosts village clubs . It means local families who have come to rely on the facilities for their clubs will now have to find new homes. Despite the blow the Army has said the decision may well not be permanent and it would review the situation after the first round of training. The clubs based at the barracks have been barred from using the land for their usual activities since March, although the first Libyan soldiers will arrive at the end of 2013. Bassingbourn Golf Club has already decided to close as a result of the ban. Bassingbourn Snowsports Club, which has its own slope in the barracks and has been operating for decades, is in talks about buying its part of the site - but any deal will rely on them securing their own access. Club secretary Martin Middleton said: 'As we have yet to find out the purchase price and cost of alternate access and whether or not the club’s members think this is affordable, we share the concerns of the other clubs about the future use of the barracks.' Statebuilding: Libyan troops will train in Cambridgeshire before they are deployed back to the post-Gaddafi country . Colonel Alex Macintosh, commanding officer of the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps, said: 'The clubs that use the base were given notice when the project to train the Libyan personnel came upon us.' Adrian Dent, county councillor for Bassingbourn, said it was not known how long clubs would be barred from the barracks. He said: 'It is a big blow for the area.' The last British soldiers trained at the Army Training Regiment barracks passed out last summer.Since then the land has passed into the ownership of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO).","Bassingbourn from the end of 2013 will be used to train 2,000 Libyan troops ."
"Mario Balotelli is fighting for his Anfield future as Brendan Rodgers insisted he would not allow the striker to compromise Liverpool’s progress. Once again Balotelli found himself commanding headlines for all the wrong reasons following Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid, given he had swapped shirts with opposition defender Pepe as he left the field at half-time. It was a naive thing to do and Rodgers stressed that, having spoken to Balotelli in his office at Liverpool’s Melwood training base, the ‘matter was closed’ and had been dealt with internally. Mario Balotelli was back in training for Liverpool on Thursday after he controversially swapped shirts with Pepe . The Italian's future is the matter of intense scrutiny after he was hooked at half-time in Liverpool's defeat . Balotelli battles for the ball with Jordan Williams as Liverpool turn their attentions back to the Premier League . GRAEME SOUNESS . There has been criticism from day one. It was a brave move by Brendan Rodgers. He obviously felt his managerial skills could stop the problem. It’s not worked for him or the club. This is his last chance at a big club in one of the big leagues and now he’s looking at Russia or somewhere like that. IAN RUSH . He still has a future at Liverpool. The fans are some of the most patient but he has to realise he’s not playing at just any other club. He’s got to show his commitment by proving it on the pitch. You just don’t do what he did and I’m sure Brendan Rodgers will have a word with him behind closed doors. GARY LINEKER . On the Balotelli shirt-swapping furore: I doubt they’re having the same debate in Spain re Pepe. All is fine when you win. Can’t see the negative in half-time shirt swap. Does it affect the result? No. JOEY BARTON . Balotelli getting a lot of criticism which is never going to help. What he needs is to get his head down and prove people wrong. DIETMAR HAMANN . I think he would have angered Brendan Rodgers when he came into the dressing room wearing a Real Madrid shirt. I think Brendan had every reason to take him off, especially at 3-0 down. I think he did it on purpose. I think it was kind of premeditated. He doesn’t care. MICHAEL OWEN . I’d still start Balotelli at the weekend. I’m not a big fan of his but he has more class than most. Harsh to put all the blame on him. Most worrying thing is his team-mates’ body language towards him. Once you lose their respect it’s a struggle. JOHN HARTSON . If Liverpool were winning 3-0 at half-time, with Mario scoring two goals, there would be nothing said. Losing 3-0, playing poorly then slam Mario. I don’t agree with what he did but I also think he’s an easy target. Scapegoat springs to mind. But as the dust settled on the incident, the focus shifted to the more important matter of how he played against Madrid and the way he has performed since joining Liverpool in August and what he has done to justify a £16million transfer fee. With only one goal in 10 appearances, patience is wearing thin as Balotelli has not provided Liverpool with a focal point and his form has been so underwhelming that Rodgers would not offer any guarantees about how long the 24-year-old may stay on Merseyside. Balotelli signed a three-year deal when he arrived from AC Milan and while Rodgers insists he takes ‘full responsibility’ for the decision to bring him back to the Barclays Premier League, Liverpool’s manager will not be so stubborn that he persists with him if the experiment cannot work. Rodgers said: ‘The manager always will be — and I certainly am — responsible for every player that comes in. So you don’t need to look too far. You can’t label it on me, so there is no problem there. I think it’s one which is very clear with the owners and the conversations we had. ‘We knew what we were getting. I said before this was a calculated risk to bring someone in and nothing has changed. I haven’t been overly surprised by many things. As I said, we took in a young player who has football potential. ‘Were we going to get that focus and concentration that is required to play consistently at the top the level? That is something that remains to be seen. And something that only time will tell. At this moment in time, he’s working hard to show he can deliver that.’ He added: ‘Whether Mario’s best is good enough longer term, that remains to be seen. He wants to score but, at the minute, he is not. When you are confident, you have more success. He is treated no different to any other player.’ It should be noted at this point that Balotelli — for all the noise that accompanies him — has not been a disruptive presence around the training ground and his behaviour has not been as madcap as it was when he was setting fireworks off in his bathroom during his spell with Manchester City. When he arrived at the club, Balotelli was told what standards were expected of him but Rodgers will be hoping that his reported brush with the law is not the point at which things start to unravel for Baloteli at Anfield. The Liverpool striker walks towards the tunnel at half-time of Liverpool's game against Real Madrid . With his side trailing 3-0, Balotelli turns to Real Madrid defender Pepe before taking off his Liverpool top . The £16million signing then gives his shirt to the Real defender prompting outrage among the club's fans . 1. Stiffen Liverpool’s defence. One clean sheet in 18 matches and 19 goals conceded in 12 games is a dreadful return. 2. Sort out the goalkeeper. Between the sticks, Simon Mignolet has regressed in 2014 and looks bereft of confidence. His anxiety is spreading. 3. Where are the goals? Even after accounting for losing star striker Luis Suarez, Liverpool’s lack of cutting edge has been dismally apparent. 4. Find a balance. Manager Brendan Rodgers has regularly chopped and changed formations in games to get the right blend. 5 Get the top gun back. Striker Daniel Sturridge’s absence due to injury has dragged on and it is proving increasingly detrimental. On the pitch he is certainly giving Rodgers — who is no closer to welcoming back striker Daniel Sturridge — problems. His play does not have the intensity that Rodgers demands of those he selects and the balance of the team therefore suffers when one part of the system is not functioning. Many would be quick to say ‘we told you so’, as Balotelli could not flourish under managers such as Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini and Cesare Prandelli and Rodgers accepts he personally will be susceptible to criticism the Liverpool’s No 45 continues to underwhelm. ‘We brought in the player to give him a chance and give him every chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘At this moment in time, of course, he hasn’t scored the goals we would like or want. We are having to give him that opportunity. We will work with the players that we have and he is one of them. ‘It is not just about improving him. It is about improving all the players. And we will see come January what the team needs. I’m the type of manager that gives people an opportunity. I understand the criticism that will come my way because of that. Balotelli, in action against the Spanish side on Wednesday, has failed to hit the heights since joining from Milan . The former Manchester City striker looked forlorn at Liverpool's Melwood training base on Thursday . ‘Like I said, you accept that as part of being a manager. You’ll take the praise if things go well with a player you are working with. And you have to take the responsibility as a manager too. Either way, I can deal with that. ‘He’s not uncontrollable. He’s certainly not that. He’s an individual talent who is working hard to try to fit into the team ethos here and the team identity. But only time will tell. He is working hard to try and understand what is required of a Liverpool player.’ For all that Balotelli is dominating the agenda, it is not the main issue vexing Rodgers. An inability to keep clean sheets is proving detrimental to their ambitions but, not only that, it was the comfort with which Madrid settled into the game that alarmed the manager. Liverpool looked flimsy — they only gave six fouls away — and two of the three goals they conceded were cheap. ‘I felt we could have been more competitive in certain situations,’ said Rodgers. ‘That is the mark of a champion. The mark of a champion is how you are competitive against the best opponents. It wasn’t through want of trying or work ethic. But it was an area we could have been better in.’ March 2010 .

"Masterchef Australia made international headlines for all the wrong reasons this week, causing outrage after it displayed the Indian flag upside down. On Tuesday's episode of the cooking show, which is incredibly popular in India, contestants had to prepare dishes from different national cuisines. But when the Indian flag was revealed from underneath a silver dish-cover the flag was upside down, with the saffron segment at the bottom and the green at the top. Scroll down for video . The Indian flag was displayed upside down on Tuesday night's episode of Masterchef Australia . Indian viewers complained about the gaffe on social media, with Hrishikesh Thite writing: '@masterchefau put the India flag upside down! Is that how it is down under?' Lalit Tankala wrote: '#masterchefaustralia Has India flag upside down. Wow!! Didn't expect this from u guys!!' 'The India flag on @masterchefau was placed upside down. Homework not done!' wrote Sydney-based viewer Sathwick. The flag, known as the tricolour, was officially adopted in the country in 1947 and features three horizontal bands, with the saffron band always at the top. Masterchef Australia is one of the most popular shows on Indian television. Its success prompted the creation of a local version, Masterchef India, in 2010. The Indian flag (pictured third from the right) is traditionally flown with the saffron stripe at the top and the green stripe at the bottom .

'Masterchef Australia is one of the top programmes being watched in India at the moment and as such you would have thought there would have been some research being done and some due diligence,' Dipen Rughani, chairman of the Australia India Business Council, told Daily Mail Australia. 'I imagine it probably wouldn't go down well with Indians,' he said. 'I don't think it was done deliberately. I don't think there should be a big uproar about it. 'But our government makes sure the Australian anthem is played correctly and the Australian flag is displayed instead of the New Zealand flag, I think we need to be a little bit more diligent.' A SHINE Australia spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'an unintentional oversight during production. We unreservedly apologise for any offence caused.'

"A Christian school teacher who was caught semi-naked in his car with a 14-year-old student  has admitted to having sex with her multiple times and sending her explicit photos and videos. Eric Beasley, 25, a former biology teacher at Zion Lutheran Christian School in Deerfield Beach, Florida could serve 20 years in federal prison under the plea deal with prosecutors, his lawyers said. He pleaded guilty on Monday to a federal charge of persuading or enticing the girl to have sex with him and he plans to plead guilty this week to sexual battery, his lawyers told the Sun Sentinel. Busted: Eric Beasley, pictured in mug shots from earlier this year, has pleaded guilty to having sex with one of his 14-year-old students. He could get as many as 20 years in federal prison . Beasley, who reportedly had a girlfriend at the time, was arrested on April 1 after police responded to reports of a suspicious vehicle behind a strip mall and found him inside the car with the young girl. Beasley scrambled to get his clothes on, while the girl was naked from below the waist, the officers noted in their report. It was still daylight at the time and the window was partially blocked with clothes. The girl initially claimed that she was 19 and that they were consenting adults who had met online but she later confessed to being in his ninth-grade biology class at the $11,000-a-year school. Beasley admitted to authorities that he had sex multiple times with the girl since Valentine's Day. Sick: The teacher, 25, sent explicit photos to the girl and admitted to kissing her during school hours . He told officers that on three occasions that he engaged in inappropriate behavior during school hours, including kissing during the victim's lunch breaks, according to a police report. The pair also texted each other naked photographs, while Beasley sent the teenager a video of him masturbating, authorities discovered. 'I miss you,' he wrote in one text. 'But we have to remain cautious and vigilant. Every meeting is a risk. l won't let that stop me from seeing you altogether, but we should be cautious about how many risks we take.' In another message, he added: 'I want to feel you. lnside and out. Not want. Need. l require physical intimacy with you. Kissing you feels as essential as breathing.' He was initially freed on $92,000 bond but a judge later ruled he should stay behind bars, saying that he could be a danger to the community. The school, where he was just a second-year teacher, suspended Beasley immediately after he was arrested. He had previously been warned by staff not to spend time alone with the girl after a student and a parent reported their concern over the pair's relationship in December 2013. Administrators said the school had obtained state and federal law enforcement background checks on Beasley before hiring him, as it does before all new hires work with students. Scene: He was arrested after he was found semi-naked in his car behind this strip mall in Florida in April. The duo initially claimed they were both adults and had met online, but the girl later said she was his student . Fired: He was suspended from his job at the Zion Lutheran Christian School following his arrest . His lawyers say he had sincere feelings for the girl and still cares about her, the Sentinel reported. Prosecutors and the girl's parents will recommend that he is sentenced to 20 years behind bars, his lawyer said, but he could also be placed on supervised release for the rest of his life. He will also have to register as a sex offender. The girl's parents have also filed a civil lawsuit against Beasley, the school, church and Evangelical Lutheran church organizations and officials.","Eric Beasley was arrested after he was caught semi-naked with the girl behind a strip mall in Lighthouse Point, Florida in April .

James scored after 16 minutes with a lob over Cornellà keeper Iñigo Alberto after being set-up by Isco. And the Colombian repaid the favour on 34 minutes with a stunning through ball that Isco scored from. Chicharito Hernandez was desperate to get in on the act in the first half but missed the perfect chance on the half hour when his effort from Fabio Coentrao’s cross was saved. He made amends moments later with a delightful flick on the edge of the area to set up James for goal number three. All this after Madrid had so nearly fallen behind. Captain for the night Alvaro Arbeloa clumsily bundled over Xavi Boniquet but the Cornellà forward picked himself up and blasted the penalty over the bar when the scores were still at 0-0. The Santiago Bernabeu was only a third full for the second leg despite Madrid have drastically dropped prices. Behind the South goal a huge banner read ‘no to violence, no to racism, one sentiment: Madridismo’ in response to the violence that preceded Sunday’s Atletico Madrid Deportivo match leaving one man dead. The rest of the stadium applauded when the banner was unfurled. Also greeted by huge applause was the return of Jese Rodriguez who injured his right knee eight months ago cutting short what was turning into an exception first season that could even have won him a place at last summer’s World Cup. Isco celebrates with James, who set up the goal with a perfectly weighted pass that split the Cornella defence . Javier Hernandez beats the keeper with a shot but the ball rebounds off the bar and bounces in off defender Borja Lopez . Jese Rodriguez returned to action following a nine-month spell on the sidelines and marked the occasion with a goal . The forward finished with a crisp strike low to the goalkeeper's right after being set up by Isco in the second half . Real Madrid fans showed their support for the returning Jese who suffered a serious knee injury last season . Jese finally came on in the 65th minute when Sami Khedria went off concused after clashing with Israel Delgado. Madrid made it 8-1 on aggregate when Borja Lopez put through his own net after Chicharito’s clever lob came back off the cross-bar – the United man so nearly get the goal he wanted but the last touch was definitely the defender’s. He had another chance shortly afterwards when Jese’s run and cross played him in but he just failed to make contact. Jese got on the scoresheet himself shortly after to mark his comeback in style. It was Isco – who else – who played the pass and the winger converted to celebrate his return after 258 days out of action and make it 9-1 over the two legs.","Real Madrid led third-tier Cornella 4-1 from the  first leg of the round of 32 Copa del Rey clash .

"Former England goalkeeper David James has been forced into auctioning signed shirts, shorts and match balls after being declared bankrupt in May. James has built up crippling debts after breaking up with his wife Tanya in 2005 and is said to have blown his £20million fortune which came from his football wages, endorsements and modelling contracts for companies such as Armani. The 44-year-old played in the Premier League for teams such as Liverpool, Manchester City and Portsmouth and has recently came out of retirement to become a player-manager at Indian Super League side Kerala Blasters. Former Premier League goalkeeper James won the FA Cup with Portsmouth in 2008 . James and his then wife Tanya in 2002 (left) - they divorced in 2005 - and modelling for Armani in 1998 . Until the revelations, no-one inside the James circle was aware of the desperate financial situation that forced him to Hertford County Court. The former England keeper has written a regular column for The Observer and has always donated his fee to charity. He also owned a house in Dubai at the time of a credit crisis, which was part of his seven-strong property portfolio. He has also worked as a pundit for BT Sport. James split up with his wife to rekindle a relationship with childhood sweetheart Amanda Salmon, and they have been together for nearly a decade. He was forced to pay Tanya £3m as part of the divorce settlement. His PR team have refused to comment about the bankruptcy. James has decided to sell around 150 items of signed merchandise through Kent-based auctioneer Hilco. A 1998/1999 multicoloured Port Vale FC goalkeeper shirt - which he would have swapped with former Manchester United trainee Kevin Pilkington -  (left) and a signed Frank Lampard shirt is also available to buy . James will auction the pink goalkeeper strip he had previously worn against Chelsea in the 2010 FA Cup final and the yellow England jersey he wore against Germany at the 2010 World Cup . He is also selling a Technics SL-1200 Turntable - this series of music player is no longer manufactured . A petrol driven chainsaw is also up for grabs as James auctions off many of his possessions . The public will be able to bid for items, which range from football memorabilia to DJ equipment and toys, from November 6 to 18. A signed Frank Lampard shirt, a bright pink Portsmouth goalkeeper top, a Malawi shirt and a NFL jersey are among the 150 items. James has even put up for auction shirts worn by Chelsea's Petr Cech in the 2010 FA Cup final against Portsmouth, a Holland jersey he  swapped with Edwin van der Sar and a Michael Owen No 10 kit with 'best wishes' penned across it. A 1998-1999 multi-coloured Port Vale goalkeeper shirt - which he would have swapped with former Manchester United trainee Kevin Pilkington - is also available to buy. You can also get your hands on non-football items such as a Technics turntable (which is no longer manufactured), three bicycles and even a a Jubilee plastic half-mug piece.

He is still listed as being part of BT Sport's media team - despite signing up for the 10-week long Indian Super League along with fellow former Premier League stars such as Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg and Nicolas Anelka. James, who made 53 appearances for England between 1997 and 2010, won two major honours during his spell in England - the 1995 League Cup with Liverpool and the 2008 FA Cup with Portsmouth before moving to Iceland to join IBV. Former team-mate Stan Collymore, who played with James at Liverpool, said the goalkeeper had a tendency to throw away his money as if he'd be earning it forever. Collymore said in his 2004 autobiography: 'If he had a new car and he pranged it, he would just go and buy a new car. 'If he bought a new pair of shoes and he scuffed them, he wouldn't clean them. He would just chuck them in the spare room and buy a new pair. 'Too much disposable income, I suppose. Too easy just to bin stuff. Too easy to spend money like you're going to be earning that kind of money for the rest of your life.' One item not included in the auction is the infamous white - or cream, depending on who you ask - suit worn by James and his Liverpool team-mates on the Wembley pitch before the 1996 FA Cup final. They came to sum up Liverpool's 'Spice Boys' and James lamented that the suits became more memorable than the match itself, which was won 1-0 by opponents Manchester United. The Armani suits were the goalkeeper's choice as he was modelling with the firm at the time. His former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Fowler told the Independent in 2008: 'It was David James's idea. 'At the time, he was an Armani model. If we had won, nobody would have mentioned it. But we lost and it has become infamous. People remind me about them all the time.' We can only wonder what the suit might fetch were it included in the auction. James and Phil Babb (right) on the pitch wearing the infamous 'white' Armani suits in 1996 .

"Arsenal know they need to shore up their defence in order to keep high-flying Southampton at bay - and some of their players prepared for the task by shutting out the cold as they wrapped up warm in training with snoods on! The Saints sit third in the Premier League table, three places and six points ahead of the Gunners ahead of their trip to the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night. But Arsenal face some what of a selection crisis at left back - with both Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal facing a race against time to be fit for the game.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (left) talks with French striker Giroud during a training session at London Colney on Tuesday . Gibbs is nursing a hip injury while Monreal has a knee problem. However, Monreal looks most-likely to solve the full-back crisis as it is understood he took part in training on Tuesday morning. The Spaniard has been playing as a makeshift centre back in recent weeks, but Laurent Koscielny's return to fitness means he will revert back to battling it out with Gibbs for the left-back berth once both return to full fitness. Ahead of the match, in a bid to hold off the bitterly-cold temperatures at Arsenal's London Colney training ground, Lukas Podolski and Yaya Sanogo were among the players to sport snoods. Olivier Giroud continued his return to full fitness by limbering up for some shooting practice and he could once again feature in a front-three trio with summer signings Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck against Southampton. Tomas Rosicky, who has found his first-team opportunities limited so far this campaign, was also heavily involved in the training session on Tuesday.

Sanchez looked in good spirits during training as Arsenal prepared ahead of the visit of Southampton to the Emirates . Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsy (right), Englishman Calum Chambers (centre) and Frenchman Mathieu Flamini stretch off . But speaking about the left-back situation, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: 'I'm hoping that one of Kieran Gibbs or Nacho Monreal will be available but both are doubts.' The Arsenal manager also admitted he tried out a front three of Giroud, Sanchez and Welbeck during the 1-0 victory over West Bromwich Albion at the weekend to see how it would fare as a strike force. He continued: 'I wanted to see Giroud, Sanchez and Welbeck together (against West Brom). 'And we are very united (at the club). Our job is to be competitive and to fight.' Wenger also praised Wednesday's opponents, admitting that the Saints could gatecrash the top four this season after a wonderful start to the campaign under Dutch boss Ronald Koeman.

"Roy Hodgson has rejected claims Wayne Rooney was about to be withdrawn just seconds before he scored the goal that saved England against Estonia in Tallinn. The visiting bench were debating substitutions as the 73rd-minute free kick was being prepared, and Rooney’s No 10 appeared briefly on the fourth official’s board before the England captain stepped up to score the winning goal. Rickie Lambert was preparing to come on and the England manager claimed later that it was a straight choice between Rooney and Danny Welbeck, both of whom had missed chances, and that the final decision had not been made. Scroll down to read transcript of Roy Hodgson's post-match interview with ITV . Rickie Lambert prepares to come on for England as Roy Hodgson seeks to break the deadlock . But just as the Liverpool is about to come on, Wayne Rooney scores a free-kick, and Lambert is sent back . Shortly after the goal, Welbeck rolled his ankle and was replaced by Lambert on 80 minutes before heading into the dressing room for treatment. Hodgson said: ‘We wanted to get Rickie on because he’s a goalscorer and we hadn’t been taking our goal chances so when you have someone like Rickie, who you know has a goal in him, we wanted him on the field. ‘So it was really was a question of which one we take off, as they had both missed their chances. Neither of the strikers could have been too critical of me if I had chosen him. 'We were umming and aahing about which of the two front players to take off and when Danny turned his ankle, there was of course no question.' When being interviewed by ITV, Hodgson was then told that their touchline reporters had seen the paperwork indicating that Rooney’s number, No 10, was the player to come off but the manager claimed he had no knowledge of that. ‘We were still considering it, as far as I know,’ said Hodgson. ‘To be fair, as I was in discussion, I don't know about forms going in so no doubt you're going to produce some evidence but certainly it wasn't my intention.’ Lambert grins as he walks back to his seat, the 32-year-old appears to see the funny side of the situation . The former Southampton man has three goals in 10 appearances for England, but will have to wait for more . Rooney, who moved to one behind Jimmy Greaves on the England all-time scorers list with his 43rd goal for his country, looked surprised when told that he was about to come off before the free-kick. ‘That's football,’ he said. ‘I think I've shown over the years I'm always capable of scoring goals.’ Rooney might have had a hat-trick, missing excellent chances on 18 minutes and just before full-time when clean through on goal but said: ‘We knew before the game, having obviously faced teams like this before, that they're tough games. 'It's difficult to break them down, and tonight it was. Thankfully, we got the goal and saw them out. It was a tough game and a good win. It was close but I was just focussing on trying to get it up and over the wall as quick as I could.’ Rooney's fortuitous goal was initially saved by the keeper but it then rebounded off the post and in . England's captain celebrates with Leighton Baines after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal . Hodgson claimed the missed chances meant that Rooney would be content with his overall performance. ‘Wayne is very self-critical,’ said Hodgson. ‘He is delighted of course, to score the winning goal but he knows he and his fellow forwards could have had so many more. 'We knew it wouldn’t be a piece of cake to come here and win the game. I perhaps didn’t expect us to dominate it as much as we did from the offset. It was harder than should have been because created so many opportunities in the first half particularly.’ Welbeck received treatment on Sunday night on his ankle but there was more hopeful news for Arsene Wenger, whose injury list at Arsenal is growing, when Hodgson said: 'I don’t think he’s injured. I think he just rolled it slightly but the doctors are not concerned about it all.' Hodgson looks contemplative in the middle of the pitch in Tallinn as England fans put up their flags behind him . ITV: Can you just explain, you might have got a break tonight, because you'd put in (a request) for Wayne Rooney to come off? RH: 'No no no. We were going to put Rickie Lambert on and we were discussing which player to take off. 'We hadn't made up our mind if it was going to be Wayne Rooney or, more likely, Danny Welbeck and it had to be Danny in the end because unfortunately he turned his ankle slightly but it's no danger because he'll be fit (for Arsenal). 'I think he'd have been bitterly disappointed if he'd come off the field without scoring a goal tonight and I think he'd have blamed himself. Luckily he doesn't have to because he's scored the winner and we go away with three more points.' ITV: So that form hadn't gone in with Wayne Rooney's name on it? You were still considering it? RH: 'No no. We were still considering it. That's right. At least as far as I know. 'I was in discussions with other members of my staff, I don't know about forms going in. 'No doubt you're going to produce some evidence that a form had gone in in a minute but certainly it wasn't my intention.' Glenn Hoddle: 'I think Rooney looked like the only one who was going to score. We made that game far more difficult than it should have been. 'We got away with it a little bit at 10 men. That's what happens in football. You get away with it sometimes.' Lee Dixon: 'It was a bit surprising. If you're going to bring Rickie Lambert on you'd of thought Danny Welbeck who was quiet tonight, you could have taken him off.

"Investigators are now urgently trying to work out who Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah spoke to before the plane took off on March 8 . The pilot of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane made a mystery phone call just minutes before flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur, it emerged last night. Investigators are now urgently trying to work out who Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah spoke to in the cockpit before the plane took off on March 8. There is a hope that the phone call could hold the answer to the plane's mysterious disappearance. They have refused to publicly comment on the investigation, reported The Sun. Investigators are still looking into the pilot's background although yesterday Malaysia's defense minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference he is considered innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing, and that members of his family are cooperating in the investigation. Meanwhile today search aircraft and ships are investigating two objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean off Australia that could be debris from a Malaysian jetliner missing for 12 days with 239 people on board. Australian officials said the objects were spotted by satellite four days ago in one of the remotest parts of the globe, around 2,500 km (1,500 miles) southwest of Perth in the vast oceans between Australia, southern Africa and Antarctica. The larger of the objects measured up to 24 metres (79 ft), long and appeared to be floating on water several thousand metres deep, they said. The second object was about 5 metres (16 feet) long. The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared March 8 above the Gulf of Thailand . Most of the relatives said they did not want to comment until there was more solid information out of Australia. One . father was adamant that he would not give up hope saying: 'Nothing is . definite. I hope my sons returns. My son is still alive.' Another . family member refused to be drawn on the news saying: 'We can't respond . to the news until it is definitely confirmed. We are still waiting.' Discussing . the families' ordeal Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin . Hussein said today: 'My sympathies, my heart is with them all the time.' The debris was spotted on satellite imagery and a total of four aircraft have been sent to investigate the sighting, some 1553 miles off the coast of Perth . Pictured: Satellite pictures released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority of the object thought to be related to the search for MH370 . Officials cautioned it could take several days to confirm if they were parts of the missing plane. 'It's credible enough to divert the research to this area on the basis it provides a promising lead to what might be wreckage from the debris field,' Royal Australian Air Force Air Commodore John McGarry told a news conference in Canberra. No confirmed wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing. 'I can confirm we have a new lead,' Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur, where the investigation into the missing airliner is based. Another official in Malaysia said investigators were 'hopeful but cautious' about the Australian discovery. This is the agonising moment that families are anxiously awaiting news of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight were told two large objects bobbing in a remote part of the Indian Ocean had been found . Chinese relatives of passengers from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 react as they wait for news at the Metro Park Lido Hotel . The fate of Flight MH370 has been baffling aviation experts for nearly two weeks. Investigators believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial aviation navigation switched off the plane's communications systems before diverting it thousands of miles off its scheduled course. Exhaustive background checks of the passengers and crew aboard have not yielded anything that might explain why. An Australian air force AP-3C Orion plane was already at the scene, John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told the news conference in Canberra. Three more aircraft were also on their way, including a New Zealand Air Force Orion and a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon, the world's most advanced maritime surveillance plane. A merchant ship diverted for the task was also arriving in the area, Young said. A Royal Australian Navy ship equipped to recover any objects was also en route, but was still 'some days away'.China, whose citizens made up about two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight, said it was also sending ships to the area of the sighting, but it was not clear how long it would take for the vessels to reach the scene. Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) general manager John Young is seen next to an AMSA graphic map during a press conference on the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . The huge potential breakthrough in an investigation that had appeared to be running out of leads was revealed by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who told parliament the objects had been located with satellite imagery. 'New and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,' Abbott said. He added that he had already spoken with his Malaysian counterpart, Najib Razak, and cautioned that the objects had yet to be identified. 'The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370,' Abbott said. Young, the Australian official, said it could be some days before authorities have anything to report and added that poor visibility reported in the area could hamper the search. Search area: The objects spotted by satellite are in one of the most remote areas of the planet in waters thousands of feet deep . 'It's probably the best lead we have right now but we have to get there, find them, see them, assess them, to know whether it's really meaningful or not,' he said.Images released by Australia showed the satellite pictures were from U.S. company DigitalGlobe Inc and were taken on March 16. Arrows on the images pointed to two indistinct objects apparently bobbing in the water. The dimensions given are consistent with at least one of the objects possibly being the major part of a 777-200ER wing, which is around 27 metres (89 feet) long, though Australian officials cautioned the first images were indistinct. The relatively large size of the objects would also suggest that, if they do come from the missing aircraft, it was intact when it went into the water. Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that, minutes after its identifying transponder was switched off as it crossed the Gulf of Thailand, the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established commercial route towards India. What happened next is unclear, but faint electronic 'pings' picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. That would be consistent with the plane ending up in the southern Indian Ocean. The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, has focused particular attention on the pilot and co-pilot. The FBI is helping Malaysian authorities analyse data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the missing plane, after initial examination showed some data logs had been deleted early last month. Relatives of passengers, who have been huddled at a Beijing hotel, attended the daily briefing earlier today, but were then urgently called back when the news broke .

Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been covering a search region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles) A relative of Chinese passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines, MH370, left, is surrounded by journalists as he leaves after learning about the latest debris field found in a remote part of the Indian Ocean . A Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigations into the pilots said three simulator games that 53-year-old pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had played were being looked at. 'We are following up on the data logs being erased,' the source said. 'These could be logs of the games that were erased to free up memory, so it may not lead us to anything. He played a lot of games, going into hundreds and thousands of hours.' An unprecedented multinational search for the plane has focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia. Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy. The depth of the water where the possible debris has been sighted would likely make recovering the 'black box' voice and data recorders that may finally unlock the mystery of what happened aboard Flight MH370 extremely challenging. University of Western Australia Professor of Oceanography Charitha Pattiaratchi said that, based on currents in the area, if the debris is from the plane it probably would have gone into the water around 300-400 km (180-250 miles) to the west. The search area covered an ocean ridge known as Naturalist Plateau, a large sea shelf about 3,500 metres (9,800 feet) deep, Pattiaratchi said. The plateau is about 250 km (150 miles) wide by 400 km (250 miles) long, and the area around it is close to 5,000 metres (16,400 feet) deep. 'Whichever way you go, it's deep,' he said.","Urgently trying to work out who Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah spoke to .

"Politicians who wore T-shirts for a feminist campaign were branded ‘chumps’ yesterday as it emerged the product was made by women paid just 62p an hour. The charity behind the £45 item launched an urgent investigation into reports they were produced in a ‘sweatshop’ in Mauritius. The shirts boast the slogan ‘This is what a feminist looks like’ and have been worn by Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband wearing the controversial pro-feminism shirt last week which was made by women paid just 62p an hour . The shirts were made in a factory on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius where workers said: 'How can this T-shirt be a symbol of feminism when we do not see ourselves as feminists? We see ourselves as trapped' But Conservative MP Conor Burns said the Mail on Sunday’s report into working conditions for the women who made the shirts was ‘hugely embarrassing’ for the two party leaders and for women’s rights campaigner Miss Harman. Critics voiced anger over the apparent hypocrisy, saying the politicians’ T-shirts should carry the slogan ‘This is what an utter failure looks like’. Twitter user Simon Bull wrote: ‘Pro-feminist T-shirt costs £45?! More like “This is what a chump looks like”.’ Tory MP Ben Wallace retweeted a picture of Harriet Harman wearing the T-shirt, with the words: ‘This is what someone supporting Third World sweatshops looks like.’ Fellow Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage also took aim at the deputy Labour leader, saying: ‘Who angers me most is Harriet Harman who sat smug at Prime Minister’s Questions flaunting her £45 T-shirt. ‘As if we take a single step closer to equal pay for the same job by wearing an ugly, over-priced T-shirt.’ Deputy leader of the Labour party Harriet Harman wore the T-shirt made in a sweat shop during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons . David Cameron triggered a row last week when he refused to wear one of the shirts, which were made for high street fashion chain Whistles in aid of women’s rights group the Fawcett Society. Both said they would investigate the ‘sweatshop’ claims. The Mail on Sunday reported the shirts were made in a factory on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius where women workers are paid only 6,000 rupees a month – the equivalent of around £120. Taking home just a quarter of the country’s average monthly wage, the women also sleep 16 to a room in spartan dormitories between shifts, it was reported. A female worker told the newspaper: ‘How can this T-shirt be a symbol of feminism when we do not see ourselves as feminists? We see ourselves as trapped.’ Fayzal Ally Beegun, president of the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Union, said: ‘The workers in this factory are treated very poorly and the fact that politicians in England are making a statement using these sweatshop T-shirts is appalling. ‘It would take a woman working in the factory nearly two weeks just to buy one shirt. What is feminist about that?’ Nick Clegg was also pictured looking jolly in the T shirt produced by women paid just £120 a month . Critics last night questioned the high price of the controversial pro-feminist T-shirts, which have gone on sale for £45 despite costing only £9 to produce. Others also asked why the tops were only available up to a size 16. As well as the T-shirts, a £55 clutch bag, an £85 sweatshirt and an iPhone cover costing £30 were also part of a range of items for sale at high street chain Whistles, it was revealed yesterday. Simon Bull, who has called people who wear the T-shirts ‘chumps’, tweeted: ‘It’s not even what a good T-shirt looks like, is it?’ Helen Purves accused the retailer of an ‘epic feminism fashionista fail’. She tweeted: ‘This is what a feminist looks like: thin... And before anyone says size 16 is big, it’s the UK average.’ Women’s rights group the Fawcett Society, which is behind the campaign, said pricing and sizing had been decided by Whistles. The charity’s original T-shirts, which it has sold for eight years, remained on sale on its website for £15. The Whistles range appeared unavailable on its website last night, suggesting it had either sold out or been withdrawn. The firm declined to comment. The shirts are on sale in Whistles, popular with the Duchess of Cambridge, and the campaign has been backed by fashion magazine Elle. Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch and Harry Potter actress Emma Watson modelled the shirts for this month’s ‘feminism’ edition of the magazine. Student Shereen Shafi sent a Twitter message to Miss Watson and the magazine, asking: ‘Does indentured female labour look like feminism to you too?’ The row is particularly embarrassing for Labour, which has campaigned for companies to take greater responsibility for their supply chains. Backbench MP Mr Burns added that politicians who wore the T-shirt now look ‘ridiculous’. And Scottish Labour leadership candidate Jim Murphy told BBC Radio 5live it was ‘disappointing’ that there weren’t better checks. However, Labour sources said Mr Miliband was not embarrassed to have worn the T-shirt, and said it was the responsibility of those running the campaign to carry out the checks. A party spokesman said it was ‘happy’ to support the campaign. Conservative MP Miss Dinenage said there was ‘egg on faces all round’. She added: ‘On the politicians, who couldn’t have foreseen how this PR gimmick would unfold; the Fawcett Society, who are very unforgiving of these kind of errors of judgment in others; Whistles, who claim to be a company with ethical values; and Elle magazine whose “feminist” issue kicked this off in the first place – when they promote wholly unachievable ideals of women’s bodies all year round.’ The Fawcett Society said it had been assured by Whistles that the T-shirts would be produced ethically in the UK. When it realised they were made overseas, the charity was told the factory, owned by Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile, had ‘world class’ social and ethical policies. Fawcett Society deputy chief executive Eva Neitzert said she was ‘disappointed’ by the new claims and will insist the T-shirts are withdrawn if there is ‘concrete’ evidence of mistreatment. Whistles said it had launched an investigation, adding: ‘We place a high priority on environmental, social and ethical issues’. It said it carried out regular audits of its suppliers and said the Mauritius factory conformed to ‘the highest standards’.","Controversial shirts were produced in a sweat shop in Mauritius .

"West Brom legend Tony Brown has been recognised for his 20-years of service to the club with the unveiling of a bronze sculpture at The Hawthorns on Thursday. Brown, 69, is still a regular visitor, working as a co-commentator on local radio. He will be able to walk past his statue, outside the East Stand, on the way to work on match days. Sportsmail gives you five things about the midfielder they call Bomber. Tony 'Bomber' Brown poses beside his statue at the Hawthorns with the FA Cup and good friend Denis Law . 1. Tony ‘Bomber’ Brown, born in Oldham in 1945 and brought up in Manchester, snubbed Manchester City to join West Bromwich Albion at the age of 15 after accepting the offer of a trial. He recalled: ‘The very first time I stepped foot inside The Hawthorns I knew this was the club for me. At the time I was on the verge of signing for Manchester City, who were my local club, but I felt so instantly at home with Albion that I decided to sign for them instead. It was the best decision I’ve ever made in my life.’ 2. Bomber scored a club record 279 goals in a club-record 720 competitive matches between 1963 and 1980 despite the fact he was a midfielder. Team-mate Cyrille Regis, in his autobiography, wrote: ‘Tony Brown was the best attacking midfielder I ever played with. You look at his record - to score over 200 goals from midfield is astonishing. Tony Brown was immensely loyal to West Brom - and the best player I ever saw running on to the ball and into the box. The best. He was scarily talented.’ Former Baggies midfielder Brown unveils the statue himself outside the Hawthorns on Thursday . 3. In 1971, Bomber finished top scorer of the old First Division. His 28-League goal tally left the likes of Allan ‘Sniffer’ Clarke and Tottenham’s Martin Chivers in his wake. West Brom only finished 17th that season and scored 58 goals in total, putting Bomber’s feat into even more perpective. It also earned him his one England cap - a goalless draw against Wales at Wembley. 4. The Brown trophy cabinet holds an FA Cup winners’ medal from 1968 and a League Cup gong from 1966. Brown scored in the FA Cup semi-final win over Birmingham which secured a trip to Wembley where the late Jeff Astle scored the only goal of the game to beat Everton. The League Cup was the last two-legged final with Albion beating West Ham 5-3 on aggregate, thanks to a 4-1 win at The Hawthorns, one of the goals coming from Bomber. West Brom goalscorers Jeff Astle and Tony Brown celebrate after Albion beat Birmingham the FA Cup in 1968 . 5. When Bomber finally left The Hawthorns in 1980, he enjoyed three more seasons, playing first for the New England Tea Men in the United States and then Torquay and Stafford back in England. He never stopped scoring goals - 11 in 41 games for Torquay and three in 11 for Stafford.","Tony Brown has been recognised for his 20 years of service at the club .

"The number of people abandoning Russia has shot up to its highest level in 15 years. More than 200,000 Russians emigrated in the first eight months of this year - continuing a 'brain drain' which has been apparent since Vladimir Putin was re-elected as President in 2012. It has caused shockwaves among analysts because until then, the number of people leaving Russia had been declining for 20 years following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Brain drain: After 20 years of decline since a Cold War peak, the number of Russians abandoning their nation is soaring and reached 203,659 in eight months this year. Source: Russian Federal State Statistics Service . At the peak of Russia's 'first brain drain' from 1990 to 1992, when the country lay in turmoil as it converted to capitalism, more than 2million people left permanently to live abroad. Slowly but surely the figure began to fall, and finally dropped below 100,000 per year in 2003. By 2011 just 36,000 people were leaving Russia every year - and for every departure, ten people were arriving from nations such as Uzbekistan and Armenia. Yet in 2012, the year President Putin won his third Presidential term, that number suddenly spiked to 122,751, according to official figures by Russia's Federal State Statistics Service. It rose again to 186,382 in 2013 and reached 203,659 in the first eight months of 2014 - a period in which Russia has annexed Crimea and increasingly flexed its muscle on the world stage. Today that figure threatened to rise even further as the Kremlin said Russia will fall into recession next year - an announcement which forced the rouble to a record low against the dollar. Threat: The figure could rise dramatically after officials in the Kremlin (pictured) said Russia will fall into recession this year - with the rouble at an all-time low against the dollar after falling 40 per cent this year . Controversial: The stark increase has happened since Vladimir Putin won his third term as President in 2012 . Russia's economic development ministry revised its GDP forecast for next year from a 1.2 per cent growth to a 0.8 per cent drop. It is a blow for an economy which has been hit by Western sanctions and the plunging rates it can get for its oil exports. The rouble has already dropped by more than 40 per cent this year - hitting an all-time low of 53.97 to the dollar - and disposable income for Russian families is expected to fall almost 3 per cent in 2015. But there are other reasons for migration. Many of those leaving have included prominent journalists and intellectuals who say they feel threatened for opposing Putin in an ever-increasing crackdown on dissent. Former world chess champion and political opponent Garry Kasparov, economist Sergei Guriyev and the founder of the 'Russian Facebook' Pavel Durov have all fled to live elsewhere. Intellectuals: Former chess champion Garry Kasparov (pictured) is among Putin's opponents who have fled . Some are gay people who say they are persecuted amid a rise of religious fervour, homophobic attacks and a law against 'gay propaganda' which was signed last year. The number of gay Russians seeking asylum in the U.S. rose from 68 in 2012 to 127 in 2013 and 161 between January and October this year. In total around 40,000 Russians applied for asylum across the world in 2013, 76 per cent more than in 2012, according to a United Nations report. Others came under pressure because of the way they reported the Ukraine crisis. Alexander Shchetinin, the founder of the Novy Region news agency, has since fled to Kiev and intends to renounce his Russian citizenship because of 'bias' on Russian state TV. He wrote in a Ukrainian magazine: 'The more I watched the more I became convinced that nothing can be remedied here. 'It will take generations to cleanse people's souls of the effects of this radioactive TV.' Fleeing: Russian gay couple Igor Bazilevsky (left) and Andrew Nasonov are among hundreds seeking asylum . Desperation: Scores of people have contacted genealogist Vladimir Paley (pictured) in a bid to prove a claim to another country. 'They are people who have already made money and are now scared to lose it,' he said . Another wealthy Moscow businessman interviewed by Vocactiv said he was desperate to leave. 'I want my children to grow up in a fairer country, one where the rule of law is more or less observed,' he said. 'I used to think it was possible to build a better society in Russia, but I’ve basically lost all hope now. It’s time to leave.' Russian genealogist Vladimir Paley told in July how he was beset by requests from wealthy clients - who wanted to prove they were eligible for citizenship in another country. 'They are people who have already made money and are now scared to lose it,' he said. The spike in departures comes despite the majority of Russians agreeing with Putin, whose poll ratings are considerably higher than most of the western leaders he combats on the world stage. Russian singer Tatiana Konkova said that was exactly the reason so many of the remaining minority were voting with their feet. 'I don't share the opinion of 90 per cent of the country,' she told Reuters earlier this year. 'I feel like a foreigner here now.' Yet Russia is still a dream destination for hundreds of thousands of people across eastern Europe. That means even with the recent exodus, 300,000 more people are arriving in Russia every year than the number who leave. The most arrivals come from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan - as well as Ukraine, which more than 58,000 people fled to live in Russia between January and August this year. Such is the appeal that Russia hosted the second-largest number of international migrants of any country in the world last year, according to the UN. The figure was beaten only by the U.S. - though it was followed closely by Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Britain. Figures are for January - August 2014 inclusive.

"The impartiality of a judge in a supreme court case in West Virginia has been called into question after she failed to disclose that her husband had sold a private plane to an attorney whose appeal case she was officiating. Earlier this year West Virginia Supreme Court Chief Justice Robin Jean Davis upheld the jury verdict for lawyer Michael Fuller’s client – a decision which provided Fuller’s firm with a payout of $17 million - one of the largest he’s ever secured. In 2011, Fuller had negotiating a private deal to buy a $1.3 million Lear Jet from Davis’ husband in a deal that the judge never disclosed and so the exact fee decided between the two parties remains unknown. West Virginia Supreme Court Chief Justice Robin Jean Davis, right, upheld the verdict in a case belonging to lawyer Michael Fuller, left – which provided his firm with a payout of $17 million in October . Davis told ABC News she was under no obligation to disclose such a deal because it involved her husband and not her, but ethics experts have questioned her decision. ‘This does not look good for the rule of law,’ said James Sample, an expert on judicial ethics at Hofstra University Law School. ‘A million-dollar sale of an airplane while litigation involving the lawyer who purchases the airplane is pending before the court? Absolutely no question. It’s proper to disclose, and it is improper to not disclose.’ ‘This is a circus masquerading as a court,’ he said. The original court case was brought by the children of Dorothy Douglas who died in 2009 while a resident at Heartland Nursing Home in Charleston. Her family hired Fuller to sue the owner of the nursing home, HCR ManorCare, contending that the poor care she received at the facility led to her death. In August 2011, a jury returned a $91.5 million verdict – $11.5 million in compensatory damages and $80 million in punitive damages – after Fuller successfully argued that ManorCare had left the West Virginia nursing home under-staffed. In 2011, Fuller had negotiating a private deal to buy a $1.3 million Lear Jet from Davis’ husband in a deal that the judge never disclosed and so the exact fee decided between the two parties remains unknown (stock image) Prior to Fuller, the Lear Jet had belonged to Scott Segal, a wealthy West Virginia trial lawyer who is also Justice Davis’ husband . Lawyers for ManorCare had unsuccessfully argued that the state’s medical malpractice caps should have applied which would have capped damages for the Douglas family at $500,000. But Fuller’s arguement that the mistake was a ‘corporate decision [made] in another state for resources’ won the day and resulted in a far greater amount be awarded. In June the case was heard by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals including Chief Justice Robin Jean Davis and in October it was announced that ManorCare would pay $38 million. Douglas' son and daughter will receive a total of $20.5 million, according to the Charleston Daily Mail. Fuller’s fees were about $17 million. The final settlement was greatly reduced on the original figure, but much more than the $500,000 cap that ManorCare lawyers had been demanding. An ABC investigation suggests that Fuller did several things outside of court which could have influences Davis including raising money for her re-election campaign. ‘Was I an advocate for Justice Davis, just like other candidates?’ Fuller told ABC News. ‘Sure.’ The other usual piece of business that ties Davis and Fuller concerns the acquisition of the private plane. Through a series of deals ABC alleges that Fuller purchased a Lear Jet in December 2011 that was being sold by Scott Segal, a wealthy West Virginia trial lawyer who just happens to be Justice Davis’ husband. When ABC News questioned Segal about the deal he said he had never met Fuller and that his wife had no idea who bought the plane. ‘I never spoke to or met anyone from the Fuller McHugh law firm. I never met [Fuller] or talked to him,’ said Segal. The original court case was brought by the children of Dorothy Douglas who died in 2009 while a resident at Heartland Nursing Home in Charleston . The entire deal, he claimed, had been handled by an airplane broker named Bob Butcher. But a court spokeswoman, Jennifer Bundy, told ABC News that Davis did know that Fuller bought the plane. ‘She knew who it was sold to,’ she told ABC News. A source familiar with the sale told ABC News that Fuller paid roughly $1.35 million for the plane. In a statement, Justice Davis told ABC News: ‘With regards to my husband’s plane, let me … be abundantly clear, the plane is owned by my husband, it was sold through a broker, an airplane broker, and I understand that ABC has spoken to my husband, and to the broker.’ Fuller said he played by the rules, and any decision about recusal did not belong to him.","West Virginia Supreme Court Chief Justice Robin Jean Davis failed to disclose that her husband had sold a private plane to an attorney whose appeal case she was officiating .

"He often gets mistaken for American DJ Steve Aoki so when Jarrad Seng heard the festival headliner was coming to Perth he decided to spend three hours impersonating him - with hilarious results. It's a case of mistaken identity for the 26-year-old, who has spent the last five years being compared to his doppelgänger at music festivals, bars, on Instagram and even on the streets of Barcelona. Since the photographer from Perth already shares Aoki’s trademark scraggly long black hair – he thought it would be a brilliant idea to get his friends together to give him the complete DJ makeover. Scroll down for video . Meet Jarrad Seng, from Perth - who has been mistaken for American DJ Steve Aoki for the past five years . 'I get called Steve a lot, especially since I work as a photographer in the music industry', Seng told Daily Mail Australia. 'People already yell out 'it's Steve Aoki' on the streets when I'm not even trying to look like him so the idea clicked in my head after I saw the New York catcall video the other week. 'I thought if I deliberately dress like Steve and get a fake beard - I would have a pretty high chance that people would think it's him. The video shows Seng strolling around Claremont Showground in Perth on Sunday - the second day of Stereosonic - before being approached by festival goers for a ‘selfie’ or group photo. 'The funniest moment was when the real Steve started his set on stage and just the look on people's faces - they were confused when I walked past them and one guy had to double check and he even asked me why I wasn't on stage. 'I even did a crowd surf when Steve was playing and he pointed at me a few times.' Can the real Steve Aoki (right) please stand up? Seng impersonated the DJ at Stereosonic for three hours . Confused festival goers start questioning Seng when they realise the REAL Steve Aoki is playing on stage . Donning a baseball jacket, an Indian feather headdress, a pair of sunnies and finishing the look with a fake beard, Seng kept excited fans fooled at the music festival. 'I couldn't decide which outfit to wear - Steve's a crazy character so I set my friends up to bring along some crazy outfits to wear,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I had to line up for a while so I could get change in the portaloo - and I had to keep my head down because I was getting a lot of comments. 'I knew that I would do this for a while so I wanted to make the most of it and I had to buy the stereo ticket to make this happen - it was the first ticket I bought in a really long time - so I had to go all out.' When Aoki hit the stage, more festivalgoers were fooled and confused as to why the DJ was part of the crowd . The photographer from Perth was inspired by the New York catcall video so he wanted to do something similar . Others are heard screaming out: ‘Steve Aoki!’ ‘Oh Wow…’ ‘Oh my god! It’s Steve!’ while they appear to touch his arm, stroke his hair and give him hugs in the video. But when the real Steve Aoki hit the stage, confused festivalgoers are heard questioning Seng, ‘but… you’re way up there?’ or ‘you should be on da stage' and ‘what are you doing Aoki?’ As the crowd cheered on the electro-house DJ, Seng is seen on top of a man’s shoulder singing before running through the crowd. 'This one guy was so happy to see me when the real Steve was playing on stage - he knew that I wasn't the real Steve but he wanted to be involved in the idea,' Seng said. 'So he carried me on top of his shoulders - and he wasn't a big guy - but he carried me to the front. 'I would do it again if the opportunity comes back but I do feel bad for all the people I tricked. Some people were quite nice and sweet and asked for photos but I felt bad.' Seng was approached by 'hundreds' of festivalgoers and excited fans who wanted a 'selfie' One of Seng’s friends, who works in radio, interviewed Aoki and mentioned that his friend ‘pretended to be like you’. Aoki laughs and responds: ‘Yeah, I saw a dude up there that looked like me. I think I pointed at him a few times.’ 'My friend dropped by when I was editing the video and coincidently, he told me that he was going to interview Steve on the show so I told him it would be funny to bring it up,' Seng said. Seng's video, 'three hours of silent walking through Stereosonic in Perth… as Steve Aoki’ while he is seen in different styles of outfits - matching the same style of fashion as Aoki' has received almost half a million hits since it was posted on Tuesday night. The real Steve Aoki: The DJ told a radio station that he actually saw someone who looked like him at Stereo . The video was posted onto Facebook on Tuesday night and has received almost half a million hit . A caption alongside the video said: ‘Yeah so I get mistaken for Steve Aoki a LOT.

'I wondered what would happen if I did the same thing... but dressed as Steve. At Stereosonic. Where he was headlining. ‘This is the dumbest thing I've done in a long time.... enjoy. ‘p.s. I do feel a little bit bad about the hundreds of selfies I was asked to be in.... (haha... sorry. I owe you guys a beer or two).’ Excited fans have taken to Seng's official page to post their #fakeaoki pictures after finding out his true identity .

Or would your curiosity get the better of you? If you’d . look away like a good citizen, you’re in the minority. A recent . experiment that created this exact scenario found one in five people . surreptitiously picked up the journal and read through the very private . entries – which included details of sex fantasies and loss of a parent. The experiment, which was carried out by anonymous social media site Pencourage.com, found that 60% picked up the journal and read it, 77% of whom were women. Only 30% of . people turned a blind eye and a mere 10% handed it in. The . experiment illustrates why Pencourage, which allows subscribers to post . 200-word diary entries without revealing their identity, is proving a . big hit with us nosy Brits. The voyeuristic site has racked up over half a million page views with more than 3,000 subscribers creating online diaries in which users share their deepest, darkest and often most embarrassing secrets. Every day, the writer can upload 200 words to tell their story. They can also pin relevant websites to each journal entry, store pictures appropriate to their stories and upload songs or videos that remind them of the times they are writing about. But most importantly, subscribers can write about whatever they want - from their affair with the boss to the friend they secretly despise - without anyone discovering their true identity. Usernames and emails are private to everyone, including the website’s staff. Diarists also often ask advice from their unknown followers about what to do or how to cope in situations. There are now 23,000 real-life diary entries on the site, which has been dubbed the ‘anti-social network’. Unlike Facebook, where users attempt to portray themselves in the best possible light, Pencourage is a platform for sharing the unadulterated truth. A recent poll found that 33% of social media users admitted to dishonesty, with a quarter (24%) of women stating they lie or exaggerate on social media between 1-3 times per month, 7% between 3-6 times and a staggeringly untruthful 1% more than 25 times. On Pencourage.com subscribers post their most private thoughts online but their identity remains unknown . The most common topic respondents lied or exaggerated about was what they were doing (29%), for example, pretending they were doing something exciting when in fact they were home alone. Just under a quarter of respondents (24%) said they lied about how much they drink. One in five fibbed about what they were up to on holiday and about their career. And a cheeky 17% lied about their relationship status. So why all the smoke and mirrors? The survey found that the top reasons for lying were: ‘I worry people see me as boring’; ‘I feel jealous of other people’s exciting posts’; ‘I don’t have anything to say otherwise’ and ‘I want to impress someone/everyone’. On refreshingly honest Pencourage, however, no such life airbrushing occurs. One entry about a casual liaison reads: ‘Condom malfunction stopped the activity as soon as we realised but not quite soon enough.’ Not exactly the sort of details posted on Facebook. Another frank entry reads: ‘I wish after everything I could be happy with myself. But with my ex having driven me crazy, secretly going after my sister throughout the one and half years we were together, it's made me feel fat, ugly, insecure and stupid.’ If Facebook makes you feel you have to compete in the perfect life competition you never chose to enter, Pencourage might just be that dose of unadulterated reality you've been waiting for. USERNAME: Waiting For a Life . Extract 1: Something strange is going on . As you know, Jon (my ex) came and . stayed with me a few days whilst Hubby was away. It was so good to spend time . with Jon. It reminded me why I loved him and what we once had together and for . a millisecond I was transported back to those days and was wondering why we . split up - but I soon came to. The Pencourage homepage is bursting with secrets waiting to be read . It seems, however, that Jon stayed in that dream state. He rang today and left . a message saying he very much likes Mr Waiting but that if I ever felt. I was shocked and super angry. What on earth does he think he's up to? Telling . me that I am even more beautiful than before, that I am a Lady and have a . ""real sophistication"" doesn't mean I am going to go running to him. Sure, he has money galore, looks that stop women in the street, manners of a . true gentleman and tastes in culture that make me want to swoon but then . there's Mr W. Extract 2: Waiting for a life . I woke up this morning with dread . in my mind. It is such an awful feeling. It is worse than a panic attack (for . me) because it is all consuming and lasts for weeks sometimes. I know what it is about and have looked for help to shake it off but no one . seems to be able to help. Even meditation doesn't help. It is all about the fact that I feel like I am an empty shell, that I have . lived my life in fast forward, that it has been so packed up with experiences . that now it has come to a stand still. My childhood has consumed 'me' and there . is no way to escape the issue that I have nothing, NOTHING, to look forward to. Oh sure I have the odd bit and bob but there is nothing that will change my . life, turn it on its head, and I seem to need that. I know I should be content . with what I have but I feel ..... I don't know. Words don't cover it.","New site Pencourage.com invites subscribers to post anonymous diary entries, encouraging them to reveal inner-most secrets .
