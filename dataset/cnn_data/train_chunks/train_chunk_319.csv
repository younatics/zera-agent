"(CNN) -- The capture of Ahmed Abu Khatallah could be compared to a large group of trappers quietly snaring rare and dangerous prey. For days, Army Delta Force commandos, the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies lay in wait for one of the alleged masterminds behind the deadly September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, Libya. Then over the weekend, they lured Abu Khatallah to a point south of the eastern city and nabbed him. U.S. officials said he did not put up a fight. Not a shot was fired. But Abu Khatallah had a reputation for hiding out in the open, relaxed and self-assured. In an interview with CNN's Arwa Damon last year, he said he was ready to talk to U.S. investigators but ""not as an interrogation."" He will now have that conversation, just not on his own terms. Where he is now . Abu Khatallah is on the USS New York heading to the United States, a U.S. military official said. After he was captured Sunday, he was put on the U.S. Navy ship in the Mediterranean and was interrogated by the FBI-led High Value Detainee Interrogation Group, or HIG. Taking him by sea, rather than by air, allows investigators ""maximum time to question him,"" U.S. officials said. But the sea transport is largely being done for logistical reasons. It's difficult for the U.S. to find countries in the region that will allow their territory to be used to transfer prisoners captured in operations such as this. Libya called the capture of Abu Khatallah by the United States a ""kidnapping."" The U.S. action was a violation of Libyan sovereignty and was carried out without informing Libyan officials, the Libyan government said. There was already a Libyan arrest warrant for Abu Khatallah, but Libyan Justice Minister Salah Marghani said an arrest had not been made because of the deteriorating security situation in the Benghazi area. Abu Khatallah should be tried by a Libyan court, the justice minister said. He called the United States a country friendly to Libya but said it must discuss such operations with Libya beforehand. The Libyan government said it expects the United States to guarantee Abu Khatallah's safety and rights, especially when it comes to a fair trial. Where he is headed . When he arrives, Abu Khatallah is very likely headed to a federal trial. That's what the Obama administration wants, a position at odds with some of the President's Republican critics. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina wants to postpone criminal prosecution to give interrogation more time. ""We should have some quality time with this guy. Weeks and months,"" he said. ""Don't torture him, but have some quality time with him."" Arizona Sen. John McCain wants to see Abu Khatallah in the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""Where else can you take him to?"" McCain said . Gitmo may be out of the question. It's a prison the Obama administration has been trying to shutter. And no detainees have been added there since the President took office, said national security spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Where he will be tried . The administration boasts that past prosecution of terrorism suspects in civilian courts has had a nearly 100% conviction rate. Aspiring Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, the so-called underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, and al Qaeda propagandist Sulaiman Abu Ghaith were all convicted and sentenced in U.S. courts. Hundreds more were as well, according to Washington lawmakers on armed services committees. Many of them are locked away at the ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado. By contrast, there have been a mere handful of Guantanamo convictions. The prosecution of the confessed mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, has hit one snag after the next and is still in the pretrial phase. Human Rights Watch weighed in on Wednesday, asking for Abu Khatallah to be provided access to a lawyer and to appear promptly before a judge. The U.S. ""is obligated under international law, regardless of the manner in which Abu Khatallah was taken into custody, to provide him due process protections and a fair trial,"" the group said. It is possible that the Libyans lack the capability to arrest some suspects or provide a fair trial, but the Obama administration should provide the legal basis for why it made the arrest without alerting the host country, the group said. What his defense is . Abu Khatallah says he was directing traffic in Benghazi when fighters attacked the U.S. mission with mortars and rockets that night. The building burned. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and IT expert Sean Smith died of smoke inhalation. More than 30 Americans were evacuated. Early the next morning, attackers assaulted a second U.S. facility, killing two former U.S. Navy SEALs working there as security contractors: Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Abu Khatallah was at the U.S. mission during the first attack. But he chalks that up to happenstance. ""I didn't know where the place was,"" he said. ""When I heard, we went to examine the situation. When we withdrew and there was shooting with medium guns, and there were RPG's in the air and people panicked, we tried to control traffic."" But a New York Times investigation describes his role as less than nonchalant, reporting that Abu Khatallah helped lead the onslaught. U.S. investigators have collected evidence, and the accused will be tried on three charges in federal court that include killing while attacking a federal facility, and conspiracy and material support of terrorism. ""We retain the option of adding additional charges in the coming days,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said. What the political ramifications are . The word ""Benghazi"" has had the ring of Washington partisan politics from day one -- literally. With the 2012 presidential election just two months away, a Republican candidate issued a statement criticizing Obama just hours after the attack. With the prospect of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton running for the White House in 2016, Benghazi remains a sore spot that opponents have continuously prodded. Last year, House Republican leaders released a 46-page report on Benghazi, in which they accused Clinton of slashing security at the U.S. compound there. They also accused the Obama administration of a politically inspired cover-up when former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, now Obama's national security adviser, blamed the unrest on spontaneous protests against an anti-Muslim video made in America. On Tuesday, Clinton told CNN in a televised interview that she's ""very pleased"" that special forces captured Abu Khatallah. But she was met with a new potential critic, the mother of one of the men who died in the attack. Pat Smith delivered a message to Clinton through CNN, demanding answers about security concerns at the Benghazi mission that preceded the attack. Clinton said that she is still looking for those answers herself. Hiding in plain sight: Captured Benghazi suspect an enigma . Benghazi attack time line .

"(CNN) -- With Tuesday's debut of Google+, a new social network, comparisons to Facebook are inevitable, and immediate. CNN.com has yet to demo the service, which lets users gather and organize contacts through such Google products as Gmail and Picasa. But based on what Google has posted about it online, here are some initial impressions. Punch for punch, Google+ reproduces some of Facebook's most popular tools but adds one distinctive function: video chat. Google refers to the video service as Hangouts. Several friends can join a room, and the live feeds from their webcams appear as separate blocks along the bottom of the window. The main video box shows the person who's speaking the loudest at any given time. Hangouts can also integrate with Google's YouTube. By contrast, Facebook hasn't made video conferencing available on its website. But the social networking giant has a close relationship with Microsoft, which acquired Skype last month. Recent versions of the Skype desktop software tie into Facebook's services. With Hangouts, Google+ has at least one technological advantage over Facebook. But Google's apparent ambition is not to unseat Facebook right away. Google has set up barriers to fast adoption, as it has done with some of its other products, by only allowing people who have been invited by friends to use Google+. How tech bloggers are reacting to Google+ . When crafting a service to take on Facebook, Google was wise not to ignore what that popular network, with its more than 600 million users, already does well. Google+ has photo sharing, which places a large emphasis on smartphone usage. For example, photos taken from an Android phone can be automatically dumped into a private folder in the Google+ Web service, a la Apple's iCloud. The Circles section in Google+ is like Facebook's friend lists. Each user can organize friends into categories and limit which group sees which parts of his profile. With Circles, users can more quickly send certain messages to a particular crew, such as siblings or frat buddies, that they wouldn't want to share with their entire list of contacts. A Google+ group-messaging feature, similar to Facebook's newer Messages and Groups products, is called Huddle. The +1 button, which was previously made available as an optional program for Google account holders, ties this all together, not unlike Facebook's ""Like"" button. Clicking +1 on Google search results, embedded on other sites or from within Google+ pages, allows you to share links with friends or selectively with groups of friends. Unsurprisingly, Google has tapped its prowess in Web search for a section called Sparks. It's like Google Alerts, for receiving updates on favorite topics. Facebook's search engine is Microsoft's Bing, but users of that site can't subscribe to updates in this way. The video conferencing ability may be Google's sharpest edge over Facebook's current product. However, video chat alone likely won't spark a mass exodus from Facebook. Google appears to be rejecting the idea that Google+ is meant to take Facebook head on. Google says its service is for more tight-knit groups, rather than for all types of online interactions. ""The problem is that today's online services turn friendship into fast food -- wrapping everyone in 'friend' paper,"" Google executive Vic Gundotra writes in a blog post. ""We'd like to bring the nuance and richness of real-life sharing to software."" Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman and former CEO, took a more directed swipe at Facebook last month. At a technology conference, he described the service as catering to ""every friend you've ever had, including the ones you can't quite remember."" Google suggests that it has plenty more to show. The company repeatedly refers to Google+ as a ""project,"" indicating it will change over time. ""This is just the beginning,"" Google said Tuesday. ""We're just getting warmed up, and we're already pretty excited about what's coming next.""","Google is beginning to roll out a new social network called Google+ .

"(Health.com) -- If you've ever seen a brown haze of pollution hanging over your city, most likely your response was, ""Ugh. How can I avoid breathing that stuff?"" But let's face it, even if you know it's a bad air day, you probably need to grab some sunshine, get in an outdoor run, or get to work. Polluted air contains particulate matter, lead, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide -- all of which can cause problems in people with allergies or asthma. Even if pollution is low, airborne pollen and mold can make a trip outdoors particularly daunting for people with respiratory conditions. How to tell if it's a bad air day . The first step toward protecting your lungs is to know your city or town. More than 115 million people nationwide still live in counties with pollution levels considered potentially harmful to their health. Air quality varies widely around the United States. Ozone, for instance -- which can pose a major problem for asthmatics -- tends to be more prevalent in urban areas, though it can be found in suburban and rural areas as well. If you live in Fargo, North Dakota -- one of the cities with the cleanest air in the nation -- you are likely to breathe easier than if you live in Los Angeles, which has the highest ozone levels in the country. Local weather stations often provide this information on their websites, and radio stations typically give ozone alerts. In addition, many websites can tell you if pollutants, ozone, or pollen counts are high in your area on any given day. • AirNow.gov, a site run by federal government agencies, provides a daily Air Quality Index as well as other useful information on air quality. • The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology's National Allergy Bureau has a daily mold and pollen report. • The American Lung Association rates the air quality annually by state at stateoftheair.org. • The Environmental Protection Agency has a feature on its website called My Environment, which gives you an up-to-date air-quality forecast for your zip code. • Pollen.com offers a four-day allergy forecast using data from the National Weather Service. However, it's not just pollen or air pollution that can trigger problems. Dr. Michael Benninger, M.D., the chairman of the Head and Neck Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, says changes in barometric pressure and temperature can also spell trouble for people with allergies to pollen and mold, people with severe sinus symptoms, and even people without allergies. How to cope on bad air days . Once you've figured out what factors are most likely to pose a problem (usually by trial and error, or testing for allergies), and know the conditions in your area, there are several things you can do to cope. One option is to reduce excessive exposure on days that might trigger symptoms. For example, Benninger recommends avoiding areas where pollen, mold, or other allergens are high. If you know that grass and trees are a problem, don't spend the day in a lush, tree-filled park; if you have to mow your lawn, wear a mask with a filter to reduce exposure to grass. Staying indoors with the windows closed and the air-conditioning on is also helpful, Benninger says. Dr. Todd Rambasek, M.D., of ENT & Allergy Health Services, in Cleveland, says there are three things that typically affect your ability to breathe outside: . • How much of an allergen or pollutant is present. • How heavily you are breathing. (For example, you breathe more heavily when exercising.) • How well your symptoms are controlled, if you have asthma. Health.com: Can't stop coughing? 8 possible reasons . People with asthma often need to use an everyday controller medication, which is a drug that eases underlying lung inflammation. Bronchodilators are another type of asthma drug that can be used to expand airways and relieve symptoms, such as shortness of breath or coughing. However, if you are using a bronchodilator inhaler all the time to treat symptoms, it's a sign that your asthma isn't under control and that you should be taking controller medication daily. ""If people take daily controller medications, they are less likely to have problems when they are near triggers,"" says Rambasek. Health.com: How to buy the right air cleaner . In addition to regularly taking controller medications -- such as fluticasone, Singulair, and Azmacort -- asthmatics should also carry albuterol, a common bronchodilator, according to Rambasek. Using a bronchodilator inhaler about 30 minutes before going outside can be helpful, he says. Over-the-counter antihistamines such as Claritin (loratadine) tend to work well and are relatively safe for those with allergies, Rambasek says. Benninger recommends using topical anti-allergy eye drops and Afrin for itchy eyes and congestion if symptoms are infrequent, though he cautions that Afrin should only be used for a few days at a time. Health.com: 10 best big cities for people with asthma . Benninger also advises patients to begin taking medications two to three weeks prior to allergy season. Steroid nasal sprays are particularly beneficial when taken in advance if you have allergies that affect your sinuses, he says. Smart ways to exercise on bad air days . If you know your triggers and have the appropriate medication on hand, there are still things you can do to prevent problems. If you exercise outdoors, try walking instead of running to reduce exertion. Don't run near high-traffic roads, if possible, and if you know what direction the wind is blowing, exercise upwind, Rambasek says. If you are allergic to pollen, exercise when the counts are lower, in the early morning or evening, and avoid hot, windy days, he adds. Ozone levels tend to peak from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. during the day. Health.com: 15 hypoallergenic dogs and cats . Dr. Anne Marie Ditto, M.D., an associate professor of medicine in the allergy-immunology division at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago, says she generally tells patients not to avoid the outdoors. Instead, she recommends that people control their asthma and allergies so they won't have flare-ups. But there is one exception: people with asthma on high-ozone days. ""If you are in a city with an ozone action day, we tend to say, 'Stay inside if you are not well controlled ... or try to avoid a lot of outdoor activity,'"" she says. ""It might not be a good day to go outside and play baseball."" Health.com: 7 surprising triggers of lung trouble . Ditto says ozone causes inflammation and heightens sensitivity to outdoor allergens such as pollen or mold. This can increase the chance of an asthma attack. Rambasek agrees. ""For someone with an ozone allergy and asthma, avoidance is their best bet because treatments aren't phenomenal,"" he says. ""For someone with nasal allergies to pollen, treatment is good so we often don't recommend avoidance. But we don't have any shots to reduce people's sensitivity to ozone.""","Ozone tends to be more prevalent in urban areas .

"(CNN) -- Mel Gibson frequently spews ""looney, rancid"" anti-Semitism, has talked about killing his former girlfriend, and is prone to hate-filled diatribes slamming everyone from John Lennon to Walter Cronkite, according to a screenwriter who has been working with him. Joe Eszterhas, who wrote a screenplay about the Jewish hero Judah Maccabee for Gibson, recounts numerous alleged incidents in detail in a nine-page letter to Gibson published by the website thewrap.com. In a letter replying to Eszterhas, Gibson denies the allegations, saying most of the claims are fabricated. Gibson's letter says Eszterhas ""only had a problem with me after Warner Brothers rejected your (Eszterhas') script."" Gibson, in his five-paragraph response, says he won't respond ""line by line,"" and that the decision not to proceed with Eszterhas ""was based on the quality of your script, not on any other factor."" A spokesman for Gibson, Alan Nierob, gave CNN a copy of the letter and said Gibson will have no further comment at this time. Gibson's bitter child custody battle with former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva ended last year with a court settlement, but not before the actor entered a ""no contest"" plea to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to a 2010 incident involving Grigorieva. The plea deal put Gibson on unsupervised probation for three years. Grigorieva's spokesman told CNN Thursday that if the Eszterhas ""is accurate and credible, the allegations are extremely serious and must be investigated immediately by the authorities."" ""But it will be up to the authorities and Ms. Grigorieva's attorneys to react to this revelation,"" Steve Jaffe said. He confirmed she has ""been in touch"" with her lawyers about the matter. Warner Bros. has put the controversial Maccabees project on hold, the company said. ""We are analyzing what to do with the project,"" said spokesman Paul McGuire. Like CNN, Warner Bros. is part of Time Warner. Eszterhas writes in his letter, ""I've come to the conclusion that the reason you won't make 'The Maccabees' is the ugliest possible one. You hate Jews."" He recounts Gibson repeatedly using derogatory epithets for Jewish people. Allegations of anti-Semitism are nothing new for Gibson. Concerns that arose among some Jewish groups over his handling of the story of Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ"" in 2004 were replaced by widespread condemnations two years later when Gibson was arrested on a drunk driving charge. According to a police report, he asked the arresting officer if he was Jewish and said, ""F***ing Jews. The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."" Gibson later apologized without acknowledging specific remarks. Eszterhas is a veteran of the industry, having penned such titles as ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Showgirls."" In his letter, he writes that he hoped Gibson viewed the Maccabees project ""as a kind of penance/apologia"" -- a claim Gibson denies in his response. Eszterhas says that soon after he began working with Gibson on it, he became ""increasingly worried that I'd made a grave mistake by hooking up with you."" It was not immediately clear how thewrap.com obtained Eszterhas' letter. In discussing Jewish people, Gibson regularly used the terms ""Hebes,"" ""oven-dodgers,"" and ""Jew-boys,"" Eszterhas alleges. ""You said most 'gatekeepers' of American companies were 'Hebes' who 'controlled their bosses.'"" ""You said the Holocaust was 'mostly a lot of horsesh*t,'"" the letter says, adding that Gibson made various false accusations, including that the Torah refers to sacrificing Christian babies. Gibson called Pope John Paul II ""the anti-Christ"" and ""the devil,"" the screenwriter alleges. ""You kept raging about your ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva,"" mother of their young daughter Luci, the letter alleges, saying Gibson referred to her with sexist epithets. ""You acted out for me the scene where you hit her. But you said you'd 'just slapped her a little bit.'"" Eszterhas claims in the letter Gibson explicitly said, ""'I'm going to kill her! I'm going to have her killed!'"" Addressing Gibson, he says in the letter, ""You said you'd become friends with two FBI agents (or former FBI agents) and they were going to help you to kill her."" Eszterhas recounts times that he, his wife, and his 15-year-old son felt endangered in Gibson's presence. The teen taped one of Gibson's outbursts on his iPod, Eszterhas says. Gibson once told the 15-year-old that he wanted to perform a sex act on Grigorieva and ""stab her to death while I'm doing it,"" Eszterhas alleges. ""How can you share a loop from the pornographic snuff film which obviously plays in your head ... with a child?"" the letter asks. The bitter battle between Gibson and Grigorieva reached a financial and custody settlement last year. Gibson pleaded no contest to a charge of misdemeanor domestic battery. Racist and sexist rants against her by Gibson were recorded and leaked to radaronline.com. Eszterhas also quotes Gibson as saying John Lennon ""deserved to be shot,"" and that he hated Walter Cronkite, who appealed ""to stupid people."" At one point, Gibson wrote Eszterhas a note apologizing for one of his outbursts, saying, ""I have a vast reservoir of rage-filled puss that from time to time spills out"" and that ""the devil seems to afflict me thru anger and my tongue,"" Eszterhas says. In his response letter, Gibson says ""the great majority of the facts as well as the statements and actions attributed to me in your letter are utter fabrications. I would have thought that a man of principle, as you purport to be, would have withdrawn from the project regardless of the money if you truly believed me to be the person you describe in your letter."" ""I will acknowledge like most creative people I am passionate and intense,"" Gibson adds. He said he was frustrated at Eszterhas' failure to produce a script in timely fashion. ""I did react more strongly than I should have. I promptly sent you a written apology, the colorful words of which you apparently now find offensive. Let me now clearly apologize to you and your family in the simplest of terms,"" he says in the letter. Eszterhas insists he was diligent and produced a script that received high praise. But Gibson writes, ""In 25 years of script development I have never seen a more substandard first draft or a more significant waste of time."" Eszterhas could not be reached immediately on Thursday. When plans were announced last year for Gibson to helm a movie about the Maccabees, Jewish leaders assailed the idea. ""I think it's, quite frankly, preposterous,"" Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles told CNN in September. ""Judah Maccabee is one of the greatest heroes in Jewish history. Mel Gibson is an anti-Semite. ... I don't know what Warner Bros. was thinking."" Maccabee was a Judean priest who commanded the resistance to Greek forces around 165 B.C. Hanukkah celebrates the story of the Maccabees. ""Casting him as a director or star of Judah Maccabee is like casting Bernie Madoff to be the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission,"" Hier said at the time. A representative for Gibson, who asked not to be identified at the time, said, ""It's an amazing story that should be told cinematically"" and that there were no plans for Gibson to act in the film, although he might direct. In his letter, Eszterhas says he believes Gibson is in need of medication and ""extensive psychiatric counseling."" ""You live in extreme isolation from the real world,"" Eszterhas wrote. ""You don't read newspapers or magazines, you never have the TV on except to watch movies -- often your own. You rarely go out. Even the church where you worship, built at your own personal expense, is attended only by family and friends. The priest there is your hire and works for you, not God. You are truly extraordinarily and uniquely self-absorbed in a town where self-absorption is common. Noting that ""there are as many guns around your house as crucifixes,"" Eszterhas wrote, ""I worry for you and those around you.""

"Editor's note: A renowned chef and restaurateur, Scottish-born Gordon Ramsay is perhaps best known in the United States for his television show ""Hell's Kitchen."" He writes here about witnessing domestic abuse as a child and what he's doing now to make sure others don't witness the same. He will appear on ""Larry King Live"" tonight at 9 ET. Chef Gordon Ramsay writes of seeing his father abuse his mother; today Ramsay fights domestic abuse. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- No child should ever have to live in fear in their own home. A home should be a place where you feel safe and loved; when I was a kid, our home was anything but that. Growing up, my father was less than a perfect role model. I watched how he battled alcoholism and how he became terribly violent with my mum, to the point where she feared for her life. Every time he got violent, any present that my brother, sisters, or I had given mum would be smashed, simply because he knew it belonged to her. There were instances when the police were called to take him away; mum was taken to the hospital while we kids were taken to a children's home. As kids, my brother, sisters and I moved around to more homes and schools than I can remember. Dad would often have a fallout with someone at work and get fired, and because our home often came with his job, we would become homeless and have to move again. To this day, I will never understand why mum stayed with him. She deserved so much better and so much more; it still pains me to remember how badly he treated her. I have four young children of my own, and I could never see myself behaving the way my father did when I was a child. I want to be a role model for my children and have them look up to me. With that said, my wife, Tana, and I are proud to be ambassadors of Women's Aid, a national charity in England working to end domestic violence against women and children. Women's Aid helps more than 320,000 women and children every year. It also supports more than 500 domestic and sexual violence services across England. Domestic violence is not identified solely by violent physical abuse; instead, it is defined as physical, sexual, psychological, financial, or emotional violence that takes place in a relationship, intimate or family-oriented. Eventually, this develops into a pattern of coercive and controlling behavior. The statistics are staggering: 1 in 4 women in the UK experience domestic violence in their lifetime, and between 6-10 percent of women suffer from domestic violence in a given year. The problem is, less than half of these incidents are reported to the police. And even still, a phone call is made to the police every single minute in the UK to report a case of domestic violence. That means police receive an estimated 1,300 calls each day and more than 570,000 each year, according to Women's Aid. I encourage everyone to help take a stand against domestic violence. My wife, Tana, and I ran the London Marathon for Women's Aid for the past two years. As ambassadors, we are pleased to say that we have received more than £5,000 in donations from friends, well-wishers and supporters of the charity. Just last week, Tana and I hosted a fundraising dinner and auction for Women's Aid in Berkeley Square in London, which helped raise more than £475,000, more than double our original target for the evening. My father passed away in 1997 after a long battle with alcoholism. These days, my mum is still my biggest supporter -- she remains there by my side through everything, and for that, I am forever grateful.

"(CNN) -- Eyewitnesses to the collision of two news helicopters in Phoenix, Arizona, in which four people were killed, told investigators they noticed no problems with either aircraft before the collision, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said Saturday. Police say suspect Christopher Jones will likely be charged with the deaths of the four killed in the crash. Of the seven witnesses interviewed as of Saturday evening, none saw any pieces fall off the helicopters before the collision or noticed smoke or erratic movement by either aircraft, NTSB spokesman Steve Chealander told reporters. Witnesses also told the NTSB ""go team"" investigating the collision that they heard no change in the sound of the helicopter engines, Chealander said. The helicopters were tracking a police chase through the streets of downtown Phoenix when they collided at midday Friday, crashing to the ground in flames and heavy smoke. KTVK-TV photojournalist Jim Cox and pilot Scott Bowerbank were killed, as were KNXV-TV photographer Rick Krolak and pilot Craig Smith. Witnesses said the KTVK helicopter appeared stationary when the KNXV helicopter struck it, Chealander said. ""That's as good as we can tell you right now. That's as much as we know."" Charred debris from the helicopters remained scattered in a downtown park, which was closed to the public.  Watch smoke and flames pour from debris » . The rotor blade from one helicopter hit the front windshield of a truck, but the driver was uninjured, and the blade imbedded itself in the asphalt, Chealander said. Another rotor blade was found on top of a parking garage about half a mile away, he said. Chealander said eight NTSB investigators began arriving in Phoenix late Friday night. They will take the information they collect, including interviews with witnesses, back to Washington for analysis, he said. The NTSB will issue a preliminary report on the crash within five business days, and the final report will be issued in about nine months, he said. Chealander said a pond in the park where the helicopters crashed will be partially drained for any further evidence, and police divers would be sent in to recover the rest. Water in the pond has been tested and found not to be hazardous, he said. ""Our condolences go out to the families and friends of the victims,"" Chealander said. ""It's heartbreaking to see these kinds of accidents."" Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris said the chase began after police received a report of a stolen vehicle and began pursuing a suspect, who abandoned that vehicle and allegedly stole a truck. The truck was being chased at the time of the chopper collision. The suspect, identified Saturday as Christopher Jones, later bailed out of the truck and barricaded himself in a house, where he was captured, police said. Jones was arraigned Saturday on four counts of aggravated assault, two counts of theft of means of transportation and one count of resisting arrest. His bond was set at $1 million after a prosecutor told the judge Jones may flee. ""He put the entire community in danger. ... Everyone on the street was a possible victim,"" the prosecutor said. Jones said in the hearing he blacked out in the house, and when he came to, police used tear gas and a Taser on him. ""I don't know how all this happened. I really don't,"" he told the judge. Harris said Friday that Jones could face charges related to the four deaths. E-mail to a friend .","NEW: NTSB says witnesses saw no problems with either craft before collision .

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's marriage ceremony was the very definition of a family affair. When the longtime partners wed at their estate in France on August 23, they made sure each of their six kids had a part to play in the event. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie marry in France . According to People and the UK's Hello magazine, which have exclusive photos from the couple's intimate wedding, the young Jolie-Pitts helped write their parents' wedding vows and even inspired Jolie's bridal gown. The 39-year-old actress wore a sleeveless, floor-length custom Atelier Versace gown with a veil that was covered in her kids' drawings. The dress was reportedly crafted by Luigi Massi, and it looks like the luxury label's Donatella Versace had a hand in it as well.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles County judge rejected Wednesday a request to reduce the $23 million bail of a former elementary school teacher charged with 23 counts of lewd acts upon students. Judge Marcelita Haynes also rejected a request by the public defender for former teacher Mark Berndt to view prosecution photographs of other schoolchildren whom authorities are investigating as possible additional victims. Berndt, 61, who taught at the Los Angeles school district's Miramonte Elementary School, pleaded not guilty in February to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. In rejecting public defender Victor Acevedo's request to reduce bail to $1 million, Haynes said in court there was ""evidence of emotional trauma in that some of the children have experienced unspecified nightmares."" The judge said she weighed ""the sophistication of the offenses and the alleged injuries to the victims,"" the allegation of ""the exchange of bodily fluids,"" and the defendant's position of trust with ""particularly vulnerable"" victims in making her decision. Acevedo argued the $23 million, $1 million for each of the 23 offenses, was unconstitutional because ""that's the functional equivalent of no bail."" Berndt, wearing an orange jumpsuit, was seated beside his attorney during the hearing. Acevedo also argued that Berndt has no criminal record, is not a flight risk, and had taught at Miramonte Elementary for more than 30 years. After the hearing, Acevedo told reporters he was disappointed the judge declined to reduce Berndt's bail. ""Mr. Berndt wouldn't even be able to go out of his home"" if he were released on bail because of the case's widespread publicity, he said. Acevedo also expressed concerns about the judge's courtroom remarks about the victims' nightmares, saying the comment could hurt his case. ""That's news to me,"" Acevedo said. ""Who has been feeding these kids information"" of what was allegedly occurring in the photographs? Meanwhile, Los Angeles County authorities have transferred Berndt to another detention facility after Acevedo complained in February that jailers identified Berndt as a child molester on the jail's speaker system. The Los Angeles County sheriff has already ordered an internal affairs investigation of the complaint, and the administrative review is ongoing, spokesman Steve Whitmore said Wednesday. Jail supervisors have said they were unaware of the incident, Whitmore said. Berndt is still experiencing harassment from other inmates after the relocation, Acevedo said. The next court date is May 1 to schedule Berndt's preliminary hearing, the judge said. Meanwhile, the California state auditor is going to carry out an emergency $300,000 audit of the Los Angeles Unified School District's negligence in managing and documenting child abuse claims, said State Assemblyman Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, who sponsored the performance audit proposal. The incident at Miramonte and similar allegations of child sex abuse at other Los Angeles public schools prompted the audit, Lara said. The audit should be complete in seven to nine months, Lara said. Dismissed by the Los Angeles Unified School District school board about a year ago, Berndt was arrested January 30. He appeared in court two days later, after which he was ordered held on $23 million bail. All the initial 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Berndt in his classroom. Since Berndt's initial appearance, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Dan Scott said an additional 200 photographs purportedly taken by Berndt have been found. It is uncertain what, if any, additional charges Berndt may face as a result of that discovery or other developments in the investigation. The law enforcement investigation began when investigators found ""over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom, with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape,"" a Los Angeles County sheriff's statement said. ""Investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect Mark Berndt with his arm around the children, or with his hand over their mouths,"" according to the sheriff's department. Some photos showed ""children with large live Madagascar-type cockroaches on their faces and mouths."" Others show female students with ""what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon, filled with an unknown clear/white liquid substance, up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance,"" said the sheriff's department. Scott said that Berndt was arrested soon after lab testing matched Berndt's DNA with a substance, later determined to be semen, from a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from a trash bin in his classroom. The young students ""didn't realize they were victimized,"" said the sheriff's department spokesman. ""They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game,"" Scott added. ""And they were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar, (but) they did not realize the spoon contained semen."" A search of Berndt's home found hundreds of photographs depicting children and a video showing sexual bondage activity that ""mirrored the bondage-type photos of the children,"" investigators said. Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy said Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring. His arrest in January precipitated a broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl under age 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The school board subsequently shut Miramonte for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about 6 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has agreed to a 7-hour humanitarian cease-fire, according to the Israel Defense Forces, but a spokesman for Hamas says it's a no go. The cease-fire is expected to start at 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET) Monday, the IDF said in a statement. It would not apply to the areas in which Israeli soldiers are currently operating. ""The IDF will respond to any attempt to exploit this window to harm Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers,"" the forces said in a statement. Previous cease-fires have unraveled early and this one might not even get off the ground as Hamas has not agreed to it, a senior spokesman for Hamas told Al-Aqsa TV. He spoke Sunday, the same day the United States and the United Nations used the strongest language yet in condemning the latest strike on a U.N.-run shelter in Gaza, with Washington calling the attack ""disgraceful."" At least nine people at the school, which was being used as a shelter for about 3,000 people, were killed in the shelling. The IDF said that it targeted three Palestinian Islamic Jihad members riding a motorcycle in the vicinity of the school. The IDF said it is reviewing the consequences of the strike but didn't say if the suspected militants were hit. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a written statement that the attack was ""yet another gross violation of international humanitarian law."" He demanded a swift investigation into the attack, in which there was an explosion just outside the main gate of the school. He called it a ""moral outrage and a criminal act."" The United States, in a statement issued by the State Department, said it was ""appalled."" ""We once again stress that Israel must do more to meet its own standards and avoid civilian casualties,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a written statement. ""The suspicion that militants are operating nearby does not justify strikes that put at risk the lives of so many innocent civilians."" An IDF spokesman reiterated Israel's point that militants try to use places where civilians congregate as cover. ""Hamas made a special effort during the past few weeks to fire from U.N. facilities,"" Brig. Gen. Moti Almoz told CNN. Thousands of Gaza residents had flocked to the shelter to escape weeks of violence -- only to encounter more bloodshed. ""The dead and wounded in Rafah are still under the rubble and in the streets,"" Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Ashraf el-Qedra said earlier. Chris Gunness, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, tweeted that the school was sheltering almost 3,000 internally displaced people. The U.N said nine people were killed, while the Palestinian Health Ministry put the figure at 10. At least 27 people were wounded . iReport: When a Hamas rocket lands in your backyard . At least six other U.N.-run shelters in schools in Gaza have been directly pounded by violence in the past month, intensifying questions about the tactics being used by both sides in areas crowded with civilians. ""We vigorously condemn today's Israeli strike and find it incomprehensible that such violence has happened again, only four days since we carried out dead and wounded civilians who had sought refuge in a UN installation,"" said a joint statement from UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl and director of operations Robert Turner. The latest attack comes amid apparent tensions between the administrations of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama. Netanyahu on Saturday did not deny a report that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro ""not to ever second guess me again"" on how to deal with Hamas, though he said the report did not reflect the general ""tone and substance"" of the calls. ""First let me make a general statement about our relationship with the United States,"" the Prime Minister said when an American journalist asked about the report from Matt Lee of the Associated Press. ""I think the United States has been terrific."" Though officials tend to sing from the same song sheet in public, there is a clear behind-the-scenes tension between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations over many issues, sources tell CNN -- including whether Israel's military operations in Gaza are excessive and resulting in preventable civilian deaths. Throughout Gaza, the death toll continues to mount every day. More than 1,800 people have been killed in Gaza since the current Israel-Hamas conflict began July 8, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said. And in the past month, at least 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel have been killed. Humanitarian disaster . Palestinian officials described a public health crisis because of the lack of water, sanitation and primary health care. Surgeons in Gaza have reported working 20-hour shifts to try to keep up with a flood of residents wounded by attacks. And the medical supplies are dwindling. A pair of trucks from the International Committee of the Red Cross tried to enter Gaza to deliver emergency aid kits and blood -- but had to turn away due to security concerns, ICRC spokeswoman Cecilia Goin said Sunday. ""The trucks are carrying a portion of ICRC's 5,000 home destruction kits ... for those whose homes have been completely destroyed or partially destroyed, and 3,000 units of blood,"" Goin said. Israel's story on soldier updated . Meanwhile, an Israeli soldier was not captured and killed as initially believed, but died in an attack by a suicide bomber, the military said Sunday. Israel had initially accused Hamas militants of capturing Lt. Hadar Goldin on Friday, as a temporary cease-fire to the conflict in Gaza rapidly unraveled. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, said Sunday that Goldin was not captured and killed, but died in a suicide bombing along with two other Israeli soldiers. The IDF said militants in Gaza carried out the suicide attack. Some of Goldin's remains were found in and around the Gaza tunnel where the attack took place, Lerner said. He did not provide any more details on the purported suicide bombing. Goldin, 23, was promoted to lieutenant posthumously. No rest on both sides . The bloodshed shows no signs of letting up. The IDF said Sunday that soldiers who were looking for tunnel entrances in Gaza engaged militants emerging from one shaft. The squad of militants fled to a house where the IDF fired on them, hitting one militant. The Israeli forces then blew up the tunnel, the IDF said. It was one of scores of attacks on targets in Gaza, the IDF said. Sirens blared much of the day in Israel as at least 80 rockets were fired from Gaza, according to the Israeli military. Israel's Netanyahu vowed Saturday to ""continue to act in full scale"" against Hamas until all militant tunnels from Gaza to Israel are destroyed. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal told CNN's Nic Robertson that Israel thwarted the temporary peace by staying in Gaza and destroying tunnels there. ""A truce is a truce, but the presence of the Israeli forces inside Gaza and destroying the tunnels means it's an aggression,"" he said in an exclusive interview from Doha, Qatar. ""The Palestinian resistance has the right to self-defense and the right to deal with the invading Israeli forces who are inside our Gaza territories."" Peace efforts out of Cairo . As the conflict continued, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi touted a cease-fire initiative as a ""real chance"" to stop the bloodshed and the best way to get help into Gaza and launch talks. An Egyptian proposal put forward last month was accepted by Israel but rejected by Hamas. Members of a Palestinian delegation arrived in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, on Saturday to attend the negotiations, the Egyptian state-run news agency MENA reported. The delegation included a representative of Fatah and Palestinian intelligence, with Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives set to arrive later, the report said. Israel will not send a delegation to Cairo, said Paul Hirschson, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Jerusalem; Samira Said, Steve Almasy and Holly Yan reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Rapper T.I.'s furlough from prison was cut short last week because prison officials objected to his manager and a reality TV producer riding with him on a trip to a halfway house, according to a prison document. ""Such people were not authorized to travel with him in the conditions of his furlough,"" says a Bureau of Prisons report obtained by CNN. ""He further indicated he was discussing a new reality series and a book with those individuals."" The two men whose presence was questioned by prison officials each said they and T.I. believed they were allowed to ride with him since they were on the prison's approved list of visitors. Prison officials, who escorted T.I. to his bus the morning he was released, never told him only his wife could travel with him and he was never asked to list those who would be on board, said his defense lawyer, Steve Sadow. U.S. marshals removed T.I. from an Atlanta halfway house and placed him in the federal prison in Atlanta a day after his release from the Federal Correctional Center in Forrest City, Arkansas. It was initially believed prison officials objected to his use of a luxury tour bus for the trip from Arkansas to Georgia, but the furlough agreement T.I. signed specified only that he would travel in a ""POV,"" a privately-owned vehicle. The popular hip-hop artist, whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr., is serving an 11-month sentence for violating his parole on a gun conviction. Unless prison officials conclude he did not violate his furlough agreement, he is expected to stay locked up until that sentence is complete on September 29, documents indicated. Bureau of Prisons officials are expected to review the suspension of his furlough, but it is not known when a decision might come, Sadow said Thursday. T.I.'s manager, Brian Sher, sent a statement to prison officials explaining that he had no idea it was a violation of the furlough for him to accompany his client on the trip. ""It was clear to me that Mr. Harris believed that I was permitted to be with him on the trip back to Atlanta because I had been authorized to visit him and have contact with during his time in Forrest City,"" Sher said.  ""During my time with him on the ride back to Atlanta, no business was conducted with Mr. Harris."" Cris Abrego, a reality TV producer who was on the bus, wrote to prison officials that he also believed it was allowed since he ""was on the authorized visitor list, and had visited with Mr. Harris a couple of times prior to his release."" A book and a VH1 series, which publicists announced the day of T.I.'s release, had been negotiated months before, his entertainment attorney, Jonathan Leonard, said in another letter to prison officials. In case prison officials were miffed that their inmate was traveling in luxury, T.I.'s wife sent a letter explaining that his attorneys believed it was safer than a car because of expected media attention to his release. ""We felt this could cause an accident and jeopardize our and other travelers' safety,"" Tameka ""Tiny"" Cottle-Harris wrote.  ""We knew we had a long trip and did not want to create an unsafe situation as we traveled so we thought it was a good idea to travel by bus."" When T.I. walked out of prison on August 31, he tweeted, ""The storm is over & da sun back out."" He had been expected to complete the last weeks of his sentence in a community service center, or halfway house, in Atlanta. VH1 announced the reality TV show soon after he boarded his bus. The as-yet-untitled 10-episode series, which will premiere in December, will show T.I. ""as he re-adjusts to life as a free man after being incarcerated for nearly a year in a federal prison in Arkansas,"" VH1 said. He was locked up behind the high walls of the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta the next afternoon. The rapper served two stints in the Arkansas prison. He served seven months there in 2009 as part of an unusual sentence negotiated two years ago to resolve federal gun charges. Those charges followed his attempt to buy three machine guns in the parking lot of an Atlanta grocery store. His latest time behind bars was triggered by his arrest, along with his wife, after a motorcycle officer stopped their car on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, a year ago. A police report said suspected drugs were found in the couple's car and they were both arrested on drug charges. While the charge against the rapper was later dropped, he failed a drug test given by his parole officer.","NEW: Prison officials never told the rapper only his wife could ride with him, his lawyer says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Comedian Phyllis Diller, known for her self-deprecating humor, died ""peacefully in her sleep"" at her Los Angeles home Monday morning, her manager told CNN. Diller was 95. Her son, Perry, ""found her with a smile on her face,"" manager Milt Suchin said. Diller's career as a stand-up comic, which she started at age 37, skyrocketed in the 1960s, partly because of her many appearances with Bob Hope on his television specials, USO tours and three movies. Gilbert Gottfried: Above all else, Diller was hysterical . She became a pop culture icon for her disparaging jokes about her looks, her cooking and her fictitious husband ""Fang.""

""The only tragedy is that Phyllis Diller was the last from an era that insisted a woman had to look funny in order to be funny,"" Rivers tweeted. ""If she had started today, Phyllis could have stood there in Dior and Harry Winston and become the major star that she was. I adored her!"" Roseanne Barr tweeted that Diller was ""a revolutionary woman who inspired me."" Zooey Deschanel, Amy Poehler and more remember Diller . ""last time I saw Ms. Diller she'd a stroke & when her assistant told her she could no longer drink gin, I immediately took her out 4 martinis,"" Barr tweeted. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted ""We lost a comedy legend today. Phyllis Diller was the queen of the one-liners. She was a pioneer."" Whoopi Goldberg called Diller ""a true original."" Francesca Hilton, a stand up comic and daughter of Zsa Zsa Gabor, said Diller was her mother's best friend. ""She had the best laugh in the world,"" Hilton said. Diller's best one-liners . Diller was born Phyllis Ada Driver in Lima, Ohio, on July 17, 1917, the daughter of an insurance salesman. She had six children with her first husband, Sherwood Diller, who she married in 1939. She married Warde Donovan in October 1965, a month after divorcing Diller. The second marriage lasted 10 years. She was trained as a classical pianist, but never pursued music as a career. She worked as a copywriter for a northern California newspaper, the San Leandro News-Leader, in the early 1950s. She took the stage at San Francisco's Purple Onion Club on March 7, 1955, for her first stand-up comedy performance. She appeared as a contestant on Groucho Marx's show ""You Bet Your Life"" in 1957. Her long personal and professional friendship with Hope began when the two met at a District of Columbia, nightclub in 1959. Beauty and life lessons from Phyllis Diller . Diller's late-night national television debut came on ""The Jack Parr Show"" in 1959. Two years later, the first of her five comedy albums, ""Phyllis Diller Laughs,"" was released.

"(CNN) -- Jillian Michaels just returned to ""The Biggest Loser"" in 2013, but she's already exiting the series once again. Back in June, NBC confirmed that Michaels, a longtime celebrity trainer with the reality weight loss competition, would not be returning in the fall for season 16. Michaels' participation with the series has been an on-and-off relationship, as she's left and rejoined the program twice since it started in 2004. While prior departures either went unexplained or had to do with her family, the 40-year-old mom of two gave a different reason this time around. 'Biggest Loser' winner: Too thin? ""I don't want fans to think I feel like I'm too big for the show or that I'm seeking greener pastures. I'm so grateful to the show and so sad to leave,"" she told People magazine. ""(T)here were some fundamental differences (with the show's producers) that have existed for a while."" Many have wondered whether Michaels is leaving because of the controversy with the most recent ""Biggest Loser"" winner, 24-year-old Rachel Frederickson, whose 155-pound weight loss left Michaels and her celebrity trainer co-star, Bob Harper, visibly shocked during the final reveal. But Michaels points to another issue she had: the way the show chose to portray her character. ""In the beginning of the show, it was tough love. You saw the tough, and you saw the love,"" she told People magazine. But lately, from her perspective, viewers saw ""none of the relationships, (and) none of the bonds that I build with my clients."" The impact of her TV persona was starting to affect her family, and Michaels felt at the end of Frederickson's season, she needed to ""take a hard look at my work,"" she told the magazine. ""I came to the conclusion that moving forward, I need to be able to have an impact on the outcome of what I do."" So when ""The Biggest Loser"" returns on September 11, it'll be down one tough-loving trainer but will have added two new faces: NBC has announced that Jessie Pavelka and Jennifer Widerstrom will be the fitness buffs joining Harper and another returning trainer, Dolvett Quince.","Jillian Michaels has left ""The Biggest Loser"" again .

"(WIRED) -- As a freshman in college, my one (moderately) responsible financial decision was setting up a checking account that rounded up every purchase I made to the next dollar and shuttled the extra change into a mini savings account. When a friend from the business school suggested I'd be better off investing that money, I ignored him completely. None of the seemingly complex investing options he proposed made any sense to my 19-year-old mind. I was happy to let my money accrue nickel by dime by penny in what amounted to a glorified piggy bank. As it turns out, I wasn't all that different from the rest of my penny-pinching generation. One recent study by UBS called millennials the ""most fiscally conservative generation since the Great Depression,"" saying they hold the bulk of their assets in cash and view saving, not investing, as the most sound financial strategy. Often, members of this generation find themselves either unable to come up with a lump sum to meet account minimums for most investment firms, or they're simply unwilling to pay a financial adviser's hefty commission fees. Now, a startup called Acorns wants to solve these problems with a new smartphone app, hoping it can help millennials outgrow the piggy bank. Much like the checking account I set up all those years ago, the app links to a user's debit or credit card and rounds up on every purchase. But rather than letting the cash stagnate, Acorns invests it. Users can choose one of five portfolios, ranging from conservative to aggressive risk, and the cost is $1 a month, plus anywhere from 0.25% to 0.5% of their earnings. They can also withdraw their funds at any time. 'Fiscally conservative generation' With this app, Acorns joins a growing list of startups attempting to create an onramp for a new type of investor, the under-30 set, which many have referred to as ""the recession generation."" Companies like Betterment and Wealthfront are using behavioral science and automation to reduce human error in investing and charge lower fees than traditional financial advisors. But Acorns takes a more streamlined approach. Founded by Walter and Jeff Cruttenden, a father-and-son team from Newport Beach, California, the startup is hoping that its dead simple ""invest the change"" model can serve as a sort of gateway drug to the wider world of investing. Haunting photos of the children toiling in Egypt's limestone mines . If successful, Acorns could radically change the narrative of this generation, transforming them from post-recession conservatives to savvy financial risk takers. ""There are 315,000 financial advisers out there. We're not trying to compete with them,"" says Walter Cruttenden, the company's CEO. ""We're trying to be the starter account, the farm school, the incubator."" That plan appears to be paying off. Among the more than 10,000 users who tested Acorns before launch, more than one third of them are under the age of 22, and a full 85 percent are under the age of 35. ""We're really excited to be engaging this young group,"" says Jeff Cruttenden, Acorns' COO, a millennial himself. 'It's going to happen this way' The young co-founder is unique among his peers in that he's been investing in the stock market since he was in high school, something he owes largely to his father's influence. Before founding Acorns, Walter launched the investment banking firm Cruttenden Roth, now Roth Capital, and also started the investment banking arm of E*Trade. It was during Jeff's senior year at Lewis & Clark College that he and Walter began discussing how technology had drastically reduced the cost of trading. Walter predicted that this cost reduction would usher in a new age of microinvesting in the U.S. ""Jeff held up his smartphone and he said: 'Dad, it's going to happen this way,"" Walter remembers. Why are we so fat? The multimillion-dollar scientific quest to find out . From that day on, the two began brainstorming ways to build an investment platform for a demographic that's both mobile-first and wary of traditional investing. Originally, they planned to design a front-end app for existing companies, like Schwab or Fidelity, but soon realized that the multitude of options those companies offer investors would only overwhelm Acorns' potential users. ""We had to consider people who are Ubering home and walking down the street. They don't have a check with them or 15 minutes to pore over a complicated document,"" Jeff says. ""We wanted to simplify and streamline it."" So the team spent the next two years dealing with regulators and becoming their own broker dealer, raising some $9 million in funding along the way. All the while, they worked on simplifying the technology to enable users to set up an account and start investing in minutes. Users sign up using their bank username and password, and provide basic details about themselves, including their social security number, income, net worth, and investment goals. That allows Acorns to recommend the right portfolio for them. Rather than offering an array of investment options, Acorns only offers users so-called exchange traded funds. Unexpected shooting targets used by the world's armies . This both simplifies the set up process for users and lowers Acorns' own costs, by reducing the number of variables the system needs to contend with. ""There's not a place to put in a stock symbol or a price or type of order,"" says Walter. ""It just sweeps your money into this pre-constructed portfolio, and when you want it, you withdraw instantly."" The Tinder of investing . Acorns has been called the Tinder of investing. Just as Tinder made online dating as easy as swiping left or right, so too has Acorns simplified the often tedious and complex process of investing. But that doesn't mean the investment strategy is any less sophisticated. The portfolios were designed with help from Dr. Harry Markowitz, a Nobel Prize winner, who is commonly referred to as the father of modern portfolio theory. Jeff met Dr. Markowitz through a friend who was a student of his at the University of California, San Diego. When Dr. Markowitz heard about Acorns, he took a special interest in the company and worked as a paid adviser in the company's early days. ""Investing in a broadly diversified portfolio for the long term is the right choice for most people,"" Dr. Markowitz said in a statement. ""Acorns enables this to happen automatically in tiny increments with minimal cost. This has the potential to help people across all demographics."" Of course, all by itself, this approach isn't likely to make anyone rich. The average user invests about $.57 per transaction, with three transactions a day. That's about $50 a month. According to Jeff, the average expected return of these portfolios ranges from 4 to 9 percent. The hope is that as Acorns' users become more accustomed to investing, they'll opt to invest even more of their money in the markets. And when that day comes, the Cruttendens say, they'll be ready. ""We want to make our investors feel comfortable as their accounts grow, so our focus on small accounts isn't at the expense of large accounts,"" Jeff says. ""We built the platform to handle multimillion dollar accounts."" More from Wired: . Someone reinvented the butter knife and it is amazing . How the next iPhone could finally kill the credit card .

"(CNN) -- Every year, I wholeheartedly embrace ""Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day"" as a chance for my two girls to see why, besides the need to make an income, mommy would spend hours away from them. Seeing where I work, with whom I work and how we have a ""cool"" vending machine filled with snacks such as Gummy Bears has helped them understand what I do and why. And that's precisely the motivation behind the latest incarnation of ""Take Your Daughter/Child/Dog to Work Day."" (Yes, there is actually a visiting day for dog-lovers!) On Thursday, 28 companies in 14 countries will be hosting ""LinkedIn Bring in Your Parents Day,"" the first event of its kind created and sponsored by the popular social networking site for professionals. Individual companies, such as Google, have hosted their own day for parents, but LinkedIn said its event will mark the first time so many companies are participating at once. Bring your mom and dad to work? At first glance, it sounds like just another opportunity for so-called helicopter parents to get overly involved in their kids' lives. First they were calling up admissions counselors, and then pressing employers for jobs and benefits for their kids. Now they're actually going into their kids' offices? This can't be good! But after speaking to parents who plan to visit their adult children's workplaces, as well as those grown-up workers and parenting experts, this seems less like a sign of helicopter parenting run amok and more like a way to bridge the very real digital generation gap. 'My parents have never really understood what I do' For Hector Hernandez, 31, a senior business relationship manager at LinkedIn, the day is a chance to finally show his folks what he does and perhaps bring an end to pressures to go into a traditional career his parents more fully understand. ""Since I graduated from college, I got into marketing, I got into tech, and my parents have never really understood what I do,"" he said with a laugh. ""My parents, they're professors, they know academia very well, but they don't have a single clue how you make money in Internet. ""They can come and see this is what I do. This is how I add value to society. Please stop asking me to go back to law school or go back to med school because I'm doing pretty well,"" said Hernandez. Hector's dad, Gaston Hernandez, teaches mathematics at the University of Connecticut. When I asked him what his son does for a living, he chuckled. ""I still don't understand exactly what he does,"" said the elder Hernandez, who admits part of the issue is his son works in a business that didn't exist years earlier. ""Lawyers, architects, you know more because you grew up with that."" He said he ""naturally"" expected his kids would pursue one of those more ""traditional"" professions. Survey: A third of parents don't know what their kids do . Gaston Hernandez is definitely not alone. One in three parents, according to a LinkedIn survey, said they are not completely familiar with what their children do. Alice Osterman, whose daughter Elizabeth Brown is vice president for human resources for the online real estate site Trulia, said she doesn't even try to explain to friends what her daughter, the youngest of six children, does. ""I tell (friends) the company, and that's good for them,"" she said from her home in Alamo, California. ""I don't actually tell what she does day by day, because I don't know."" Paul Osterman said he doesn't know what his daughter does, either, and looks forward to getting some answers. ""All of our children complain about how tired they are when they work. I'd like to go there and see what they actually do for their paycheck,"" he said as his wife and daughter cracked up. ""I was also thinking it would be very interesting to talk to her boss because we know ... all of her little problems growing up and it might do him some good if he heard it from us,"" the former manager for Ford dealerships said. ""Uh-oh, Elizabeth, are you having second thoughts about having your mom and dad come to your office?"" I had to ask. ""Yeah, definitely,"" the San Francisco-based mom of two kids, 9 and 10, joked. But all kidding aside, she looks forward to the chance for her parents to see what she does so they can relate more to her professional experience. ""I'm arguably at work more than I am at home with my own family, so it's all about relating,"" she said. ""It'll be nice to have them come and get a glimpse of what I'm talking about and sort of the vibe of how the workplace has changed since they've been in the workplace and maybe better relate to my stories about work."" Getting advice from parents . Part of the goal, said LinkedIn executives, is helping parents have a better understanding of what their kids do so they can provide advice about work. In the company's global survey, 50% of parents said they feel they could help their child if they had a better understanding of what they did. ""We believe that parents do have a lot of wisdom to share with their children, but if they don't understand exactly what it is they do, sometimes it can be hard to give that advice,"" said Catherine Fisher, LinkedIn's director of corporate communications. ""We want to bridge that gap."" Parenting expert and clinical psychologist Madeline Levine, author of two New York Times best-selling books including ""Teach Your Children Well,"" says the visits could seal that gap between ""the digital natives and us immigrants."" But, she says, the event shouldn't be an excuse for parents ""to stick their nose in their kids' business."" She said participating companies would be wise to make that very clear. ""If the parent comes home and says, 'I noticed that so and so's mother was saying she made more money than you made, what's that about?' Then it's a disaster,"" said Levine, a mom of three grown sons. The anti-helicopter parent . Neither the Hernandez family nor the Ostermans show any signs of taking this experiment too far. In fact, when I asked them if they were helicopter parents, they laughed. ""Actually, we sometimes criticized ourselves,"" said Hernandez, who moved to the U.S. from Chile. ""We didn't get involved enough."" Alice Osterman said, ""Our attitude on parenthood is to have them well-educated, train them morally and spiritually ... and then, 'Good luck.' "" ""My idea was just to say, 'OK, you're 21 kid. Get going,'"" said Paul Osterman, without missing a beat. (The couple has been married for nearly 60 years.) Brown, the Ostermans' daughter, said she doesn't think the idea of this day perpetuates the notion of helicopter parenting. ""I think it more just acknowledges that the lines are being blurred between work and home and so why not lean in to that and make sure that everyone can appreciate everyone's experience,"" she added. She's looking forward to a session where the participating parents will give her and her colleagues advice and just having her parents get a glimpse into her work environment. ""People sitting on yoga balls at their desks and all the food in the kitchen,"" she said. ""Things that I talk to them about, but it's almost beyond their imagination."" Her dad chimed in: ""She's also hoping her father will keep his mouth shut.""

"(CNN) -- There was a dash of hope and a dose of disappointment in the search for an American family and their friends lost at sea for the past month. New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre released an undelivered text message found in the satellite phone system used by the schooner Nina. It's the last known message sent from the ship. The message sent on June 4, but never delivered, reads: ""THANKS STORM SAILS SHREDDED LAST NIGHT, NOW BARE POLES. GOINING 4KT 310DEG WILL UPDATE COURSE INFO @ 6PM."" The transmission is important because it gives search teams the approximate location and actual time of the last transmission, said Nigel Clifford, Maritime New Zealand's general manager safety and response services. Information can be used to help rescue teams plot search areas. The message was found in the system of the satellite phone provider, Iridium. The ship went missing en route from New Zealand to Australia. Even with the new information, authorities have not been able to find the ship. Six Americans and one Briton were on board. ""Today's radar search of more than 97,000 square nautical miles has been completed without any sighting of the vessel,"" the Rescue Coordination Centre said Thursday. The ship . The Nina was built out of wood in 1928, but it's tough, said Cherie Martinez, whose brother, David Dyche, is the Nina's owner and its captain. ""Nina always comes back to port. She might get disabled, but she always comes back to port,"" Martinez said. Martinez has faith in her brother's strong sailing abilities. Dyche has firmly handled the Nina's rudder on the high seas for decades. Twenty years ago, they crossed the Atlantic Ocean together. Shipwreck survivor recounts drama on high seas . Fateful weather . The weather dealt Dyche and his schooner an ill-fated hand after they left the port of Opua in northern New Zealand, with his wife and their teenage son. Four friends were sailing with them -- one from Britain, the other three from the United States. Not far into their planned 1,200-mile tour across the Tasman Sea, the waters picked up fury. Evi Nemeth, a revered computer scientist, was among the crew. On June 3, she called a meteorologist by satellite phone. She reported 60 mph winds and 18-foot waves and asked him for an escape route. Head south, he told her. But brace for a storm. The next day, he received text message: ""ANY UPDATE 4 NINA?...EVI."" Dyche's mother did receive a fuzzy phone call that sounded like it was coming from overseas sometime after the seven crew members set sail. She heard her name, then the line clicked out. The storm . The tempest must have been a mean one. ""Records show that conditions at the last known position for the vessel, on 4 June, were very rough,"" Maritime New Zealand said. Winds of 50 mph with gusts of 70 mph had to have battered the 70-foot sailboat, while 26-foot waves tossed it around. The Nina went incommunicado while running from raging seas, 400 miles north-northwest of New Zealand. The sailing yacht is well-equipped, with a tracking device, a satellite phone and an emergency buoy, which is meant to deploy automatically when a ship takes on water. But not a single signal has come from the boat for more than three weeks. Nail-biting wait . Family members alerted maritime authorities in New Zealand in mid-June that the Nina was missing after wondering for days why they had not heard anything from Dyche. Rescuers put out a notice to all ships in the Tasman Sea, requesting reports on any sightings of the ship. None came in. The search from the air began, and it continues. ""While we have grave concerns for the crew on board Nina, we have not given up hope of finding survivors,"" mission controller Neville Blakemore said. Wisdom from the sea: 'React fast or be swept away' CNN's Ben Brumfield and Miguel Marquez contributed to this report.","Undelivered text message provides information on the last known location of the ship .

"(CNN) -- Sure, serious-minded folks from the White House on down have taken to Tumblr, the popular blogging platform that Yahoo announced it had purchased this week. When you host 105 million blogs, you're bound to have all types. But since hitting the Web in 2007, the blogs that have emerged as hits on Tumblr have tended to be silly, snarky or both. Photos: Big acquisitions in the tech world . With its quick and easy tools for posting and image-friendly layouts, Tumblr has become a natural landing spot for folks in the entertain-me-now world of the Web. CNNMoney: Tumblr's David Karp on Marissa Mayer and dropping out of school . With lots of folks giving the site a look for the first time since news of the $1.1 billion deal was announced, here are 10 fun Tumblr blogs you might want to check out: . Reasons My Son Is Crying . This one will probably resonate the most with parents who will likely recognize those moments where frustration meets hilarity. Greg Pembroke of Rochester, New York, started the blog to find the humor in those out-of-left field toddler meltdowns, as practiced by his sons William and Charlie. Among the captions on his photos of weeping wee ones: . ""He can't climb into the sea lion tank."" ""I touched his foot with my foot."" ""We helped him put on the boots he loves to wear."" He's since opened the blog up to reader submissions -- meaning there are now daughters crying, too. Kim Jong Il Looking at Things . This blog, like the Dear Leader himself, is no longer active. But scrolling back through its hundreds of photos is still pretty hilarious. Say what you will about his anti-West rhetoric and dictatorial tendencies. Kim Jong Il knew how to rock a pair of giant sunglasses. And he loved looking at things. Among the North Korean propaganda shots are images of Kim stoically examining such items as fish, snack food, pizza dough, soy sauce and a juice box. ""Why is it so funny?"" wrote Joao Rocha, who ran the blog from Lisbon, Portugal. ""I have no idea either."" Once you've inspected Kim's inspections, don't give up hope. As a self-described ""shameless knock-off"" shows, his successor, Kim Jong Un, likes to look at things too. How Do I Put This Gently? Even if you don't follow the blog, you've probably seen some of its posts crop up on Facebook, Twitter and other sites. Tumblr probably played the biggest role on the Internet in reviving the animated GIF -- those looping snippets of video that, when done right, are strangely entrancing. This one takes scenes from movies and TV and uses them to describe everyday situations. Humans of New York . If most of these are silly, HONY is captivating and, at times, poignant. In 2010, having just lost his job in finance, Brandon Stanton set out to create a sort of photographic census of New York City. Three years later, he's approached more than 10,000 people, taken 5,000 photos and, in the process, showcased the diversity of a city and a world. He interviews each subject and usually captions the photos with a choice quote or detail from that interview. Actresses Without Teeth . It's actresses. Photoshopped. Without teeth. (Warning: Once these images are seen, they cannot be unseen.) Literally Unbelievable . OK, folks. ""Literally,"" according to Merriam-Webster, means ""in a literal sense or manner; actually."" So when you say something is literally unbelievable, it means no one should believe it. If only some folks on Facebook could take their own advice. This blog rounds up public Facebook posts in which people share articles from The Onion, a satire site, thinking they're real. Its name comes from one reaction to ""news"" of Planned Parenthood's ""$8 billion Abortionplex,"" complete with coffee shops, bars and a 10-screen movie theater. ""My favorite posts are the ones that express complete shock but not an ounce of doubt,"" Hongo told CNN in 2011. "" 'I can't believe this!' is a pretty funny response to something you should not believe."" Rich Kids of Instagram . ""They have more money than you, and this is what they do."" This round-up of shots from the Facebook-owned photo app is enough to get even the biggest supply-side economist a little steamed. Posing in front of their yachts. Partying in The Hamptons. Showing off their birthday-present Porsches or sipping Dom Perignon through a straw. Each of those, and so much more, is on display for all the propaganda your class-warfare inclinations will ever need. Awesome People Hanging Out Together . If you want to see famous people on the Internet, there are millions of places to find them. But there's something cool about the often-surprising meetings chronicled here that makes you wish you could be listening in. Like President Gerald Ford kicking a soccer ball with Pele. Or Jack Nicholson listening to The Monkees warm up. Or CNN's own Anthony Bourdain cooking something with a lot of tentacles while a horrified Christopher Walken watches. From vintage images to glossy publicity shots, these are guaranteed to draw you in. White Men Wearing Google Glass . A new entry to the Tumblr-scape, this one highlights, without words, an issue Google will face while pushing its innovative new piece of wearable tech. If you looked a little dorky before, you'll look a lot dorky with these things strapped around your head. Bun B's Jumbo Coloring and Rap Activity Tumblr . Who among us has never wanted to color a picture of Vanilla Ice? Or do a connect-the-dots to put a crown on The Notorious B.I.G.'s head? Or pencil their way through a maze to help Humpty Hump find the Burger King bathroom (to get busy, obviously). Almost all of us, I'm betting. But that's what you get on this Tumblr, from the wonderfully twisted mind of rapper Bun B. The mashup of childhood memories and hip-hop stars doesn't make any sense. Which, in its way, makes perfect sense. In other words, it's perfect for Tumblr.","On Tumblr, the random and humorous win the day .
Top blogs include pictures of kids crying for silly reasons, actresses with no teeth .

"(CNN) -- Remember that old tune ""Friday, I'm in Love""? Well, some daters are looking to make it a reality. ""I have found a wonderful weekend lover,"" reads a testimonial by ""Leah, 38"" on the new dating website, parttimelove.co.uk. ""He asks for no more, and the times we spend together are magical."" The site, launched in early January, is the brainchild of relationship author and blogger Helen Croydon. Its target demographic is people who want to be independent but also want to fall in love, she says. Some may wonder whether Part Time Love is simply the newest in a line of dating sites where users troll for one-night stands. But the site isn't just Tinder with a romantic sheen, if you believe its marketing spiel. ""We are not a no-strings website. We are for singles looking for regular partners with mutual attraction, genuine friendship, respect and a magical spark but whom have no expectations of moving in after three months and value their free time and independence,"" claims the site, which users must opt into via other, more established dating sites. Croydon asserts that a low-maintenance or part-time relationship is distinctively different than the eloquently named ""booty call,"" or the even more lucid ""casual encounter"" in that the goal is lasting love. Croydon admits it's not for everyone. She envisions her demographic as users in their mid-to-late 30s and early 40s who are set in their ways and might find it difficult to adapt domestically to a new partner. ""They're realistic on the fairytale,"" she says. In 2011, writer Laura Tennant wrote a column ""We're happily semi-detached"" in a British newspaper about her part-time cohabitation with boyfriend, Sean Walsh. She had just completed a difficult divorce -- ""aren't they all?"" she joked in an e-mail with CNN -- and wasn't sure she ever wanted to get married again. What she was sure of was that she and Walsh worked really well together as the relationship stood. They were ""living apart together,"" as she called it. Fast forward to 2014, and now Tennant is engaged to marry Walsh. ""Over time, Sean and I have become more and more sure that we are each other's soulmate and life partner,"" she says. ""And we have slowly but surely got to the point where we are ready to make the ultimate commitment to each other."" But, that doesn't mean they each won't have their alone time. The couple is planning for Walsh to have a pied-Ã -terre, but not in the Ernest Hemingway sense. ""As it is, it is totally workable, albeit somewhat unusual,"" she says. ""We are working out logistics at the moment, but I reckon we will live together and Sean will rent a work-live space nearby where he can write, sometimes sleep, and recharge his batteries."" Croydon explores what she calls ""low-maintenance relationships"" in her new book ""Screw the Fairytale: A Modern Girl's Guide to Sex and Love,"" in which she debunks the traditional ideal of the omnipresent partner. Croydon says she never wants to get married or have kids. (She's also quite familiar with unorthodox dating styles; her first book, ""Sugar Daddy Diaries,"" was about her penchant for older men.) ""You don't have to see someone three to four nights a week to express love,"" she told CNN over the phone from London. ""In every other aspect of life, we've gone for convenience, independence and where individualism is promoted,"" she says. ""Yet, you have this socially approved model of relationship that you live together."" Croydon says for it to work, the partners' emphasis is still on a genuine relationship, in that there is romance and sparks but ""without all the monotony and obligation of a full-time relationship."" Jill Weber, a Virginia-based clinical psychologist and author of ""Having Sex, Wanting Intimacy: Why Women Settle for One-Sided Relationships"" says this particular style of dating can certainly feel empowering as it allows daters to compartmentalize the relationship. ""It protects you; there's less vulnerability,"" she says. Sooner or later, though, she says one or both partners might catch stronger feelings and want something more. ""Ultimately, what connects us with one another is being vulnerable,"" she asserts. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Weber says it's also important for each partner to feel like they have their own life. ""You should feel safe and at ease in your relationship,"" she says, meaning that you aren't constantly worrying where your partner is and vice versa. If that's not the case, a conversation about space is in order. Failing that, it might be time to re-evaluate the healthiness of the relationship. As for Croydon, she's still single and ready to mingle part-time. Would you use a website to find a part-time lover?

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- To see her playing with her friends, Maya Lama seems much like any other child. But until last year, the 12-year-old Nepalese girl led a very different existence, forced to work grueling 16-hour shifts in a carpet factory in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Maya's ordeal began in 2011 when, as a 10 year old, she came to the city for a visit with her uncle. Little did she know he would force her into becoming one of the country's estimated 1.6 million child laborers, putting her to work in exchange for money to give her parents. For the next year, instead of going to school, she said she was made to work from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. everyday, with barely any breaks. Like Maya, Yangzee Sherpa from Taplejung in northeastern Nepal was also coerced to join the workforce at an early age. She said her grandfather brought her to the capital to work because the family needed money. ""My father was an alcoholic and my mother couldn't take care of me,"" said the 12 year old. ""I don't know why they sent me to work while my two brothers went to school."" Nepal's underage workers . Though child labor is illegal in Nepal, an estimated 1.6 million children between the ages of five and 17 years are in the work force, according to the National Child Labor Report. About three-quarters of them are under the age of 14, and most are girls. Child workers are a frequent sight on Kathmandu's streets, whether cleaning dishes in local restaurants or making a living as conductors on the city's public transport. Many are employed in the carpet, brick and garment industries, or in private homes as domestic workers. Employers typically see the relationship as a mutually beneficial arrangement, providing the children accommodation and education, as well as a salary that supports their families, said Krishna Hari Pushkar, director general of Nepal's Department of Labor. Though working as underage domestic help is defined as child labor, there is a mutual agreement between the children, their parents and the employers, Pushkar said, referring to it as ""social adoption."" Rescued from forced labor . Thousands of children continue to work as breadwinners for their families. Maya and Yangzee are some of the lucky ones. They were rescued by Nepal Goodweave Foundation, a local non-governmental organization that works to eradicate child labor within the carpet industry. Today, they live with more than 30 other children, all under 14, at the foundation's transit home in Kathmandu. A regular day at this hostel-like facility is filled with children chattering, playing and attending classes. But when they sit and share their past, an eerie hush falls over the room. While Nepal's Interim Constitution of 2007 guarantees the rights of children, and the country has signed major international conventions against child labor, enforcement is weak. Under its National Master Plan on Child Labor, the country has identified the worst forms of child labor -- bonded labor, domestic child labor and carpet weaving among them -- and aims to eliminate them by 2016. It hopes to eliminate all other forms of child labor by 2020. In a recent address during World Day Against Child Labour, Hanaa Singer, country representative of the United Nations Children's Fund to Nepal, said that addressing the issue should be a priority. However, she said the country lacks the number of labor inspectors necessary to effectively monitor child labor practices in illegal factories, or in residential situations where children are often employed as domestic helpers. Recently, protests rocked Nepal's capital following the death of a 12-year-old girl who was working as a domestic helper in the neighboring district of Lalitpur. Srijana Chaudary, a former kamlari or bonded laborer, self-immolated in March because of her perceived academic failures, according to her employers' testimony to the police. While police ruled her death a suicide, activists argued that the girl was ill-treated and her employers should be held accountable for her death. In response to the public outcry, the government agreed to form a committee to investigate the case. Its report is still to be released. The modern problem of kamlari . While forms of bonded labor have existed in Nepal for centuries, the contemporary kamlari issue stems from the 1950s, when the eradication of malaria in the country's Terai region led migrants from other parts of the country to move in and occupy land traditionally owned by the Tharu ethnic community. With no legal records of their traditional land ownership, the Tharus were forced to become agricultural laborers for their new landlords and many were forced into debt. Many Tharu girls as young as five were sold into indentured domestic servitude by their families as a way of repaying the debts, where they could experience years of unpaid menial labor, violence and abuse, according to Shanta Chaudhary, herself a former kamlari. When Nepal officially banned the practice in 2000, an estimated 200,000 bonded laborers from 37,000 households were emancipated, according to the survey statistics from the Backward Society Education, a non-governmental organization working to eradicate the practice. But with the government ban focusing largely on men working in the farms, girls working as child slaves for their landlords were mostly overlooked, said Man Bahadur Chhetri from the Kamlari Abolition Project, a part of the U.S.-based non-profit Nepal Youth Foundation. According to Chhetri, some 12,000 kamlaris have since been rescued. However, he said, more than 500 girls, especially in Kailai and Kanchanpur districts in far-western Nepal, are still working as child domestic workers. A family tradition . Shanta was among those rescued following the 2006 decision by Nepal's Supreme Court to make the kamlari practice illegal. ""I was born into a family of bonded laborers,"" said Shanta, now an activist and former Constitutional Assembly member in Nepal's interim parliament. ""I was expected and forced to work since I was eight."" For the next 18 years, Shanta said she toiled under harsh circumstances as a domestic worker, serving her landlord in Dang in mid-west Nepal. She was freed when she was 26. Now 32, she has taught herself to read and write, entered politics and successfully contested the 2008 general election. Despite government efforts, Shanta thinks while poverty continues to exist in Nepal, so will child labor. ""It might be minimized but not completely eradicated,"" she said. According to the United Nations Development Program's International Human Development Indicator, 44.2% of Nepal's population lives under the poverty line. In extreme cases, some parents send children to work. Sometimes, children themselves run away in search of a better life. While many Nepalese children are still trapped in this abysmal situation, the ones rescued share optimism for a better future -- their traumatic past has not killed these children's dreams. ""I want to study and become a counselor so I can help children like myself when I grow up,"" Maya said. Yangzee, on the other hand, said she wants to continue the alpine legacy of her community. ""I'm going to climb a mountain someday,"" she said. ""It'll be Everest.""","Though child labor is illegal in Nepal, an estimated 1.6 million aged between five and 17 work .

"(CNN) -- For a preview of the next big thing in video gaming, look no further than the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the splashy industry showcase that kicks off Monday in Los Angeles. Will it be the oddly named Wii U, Nintendo's attempt to update its aging Wii console for a new wave of gamers? Or ""Halo 4,"" the next chapter in the massively popular sci-fi action series? Or maybe a surprise device or game that comes out of nowhere to captivate attendees? This year's E3, as the annual trade show is better known, arrives during a time of upheaval for the multibillion-dollar gaming industry, which is scrambling to adapt to changing consumer habits. While home console gaming remains huge, more and more people are playing casual or social games on touchscreen phones and tablets. ""I think we may be seeing the last generation of dedicated handheld gaming systems with the PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS,"" said Blair Herter, co-host G4TV's ""X-Play."" ""What we've seen is the mobile gaming space really take over what used to be considered the handheld gaming market."" Many analysts, including Herter, think this year's E3 won't have as much bang as previous shows. Herter said he thinks this is because of expectations for next-generation consoles being developed by Sony and Microsoft for release in 2013, and game developers' hesitation to make something that might have a short shelf life. As an industry-only event, E3 is geared toward gaming media, developers and insiders. But in an effort to reach out to the public, many companies will be streaming events and shows throughout the four days of the conference to give fans early glimpses at new games and let them hear from developers directly. The E3 show floor doesn't open until Tuesday, although festivities begin Monday with press announcements by Microsoft, Sony and several game developers. Here's a roundup of what to look for: . The Wii U, ready for its closeup . Most companies at E3 will be showing off what their existing hardware can do or emphasizing new video game titles. Nintendo is the only one of the Big Three console makers -- a trio that includes Microsoft and Sony -- that will be demonstrating a new gaming system this year -- the Wii U. While the Wii U was previewed in more primitive form at last year's E3, there have reportedly been some changes in how the console looks and what it can do. Official word has been hush hush, which is typical for Nintendo before a big announcement. However, some images and news have leaked out suggesting the touchscreen controller for the Wii U will be different from what was shown last year. There has been some confusion about whether the Wii U is just a new controller or a more powerful console. Nintendo hopes to clear that up next week by demonstrating a ""final"" version of the system with games designed specifically for the Wii U. At last year's E3, Nintendo showed a Wii U video demo featuring gameplay from Xbox 360 and PlayStation games. Pricing remains a mystery for the Wii U, which is expected to go on sale in fall 2012. In April, Nintendo chief executive Satoru Iwata said a price for the new console would not be announced at E3, but that the company would reveal its initial lineup of games. Some industry analysts think Nintendo needs to announce a price at E3 to generate buzz for the console. New offerings for Vita and Kinect . Some observers think the current lineup of consoles -- the Wii, Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 -- will all be replaced by newer systems by late 2013. ""I think it is safe to assume this will be the last E3 where the current generation of consoles are talked about,"" said G4TV's Herter. At E3, both Sony and Microsoft will be focusing on new software for their current systems. Sony is expected to make a big push for games for its PS Vita handheld console. The new gaming platform, released in February, has been suffering from a lack of new content after its initial launch. Critics have praised the Vita as technologically impressive but agree the device needs major game franchises to make it more popular. Help may be on the way in the form of new Vita titles. ""Little Big Planet Karting,"" a racing game featuring Sackboy, and ""PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale,"" a fighting game with some of Sony's top characters, are likely to be announced next week as part of cross-platform gameplay with the PlayStation 3. There also have been strong rumors of a ""Monster Hunter"" game for the Vita to increase support for the console in Japan. Microsoft will concentrate its E3 efforts on development for the popular Kinect motion controller and additional games for the venerable Xbox 360. There also are rumors flying around that Microsoft will unveil a more refined recognition system for Kinect, including the sensor's ability to read individual finger movements. Microsoft also may announce new partnerships with TV broadcasters and programs in an effort to further transform the gaming console into a home entertainment center. Currently, HBO, ESPN, Hulu Plus, Netflix and others are part of the television lineup for the Xbox 360. Big game titles . On the software front for the Xbox 360, ""Halo 4"" will be showcased in a four-hour event with its new developer, 343 Industries, and the return of Master Chief as the main character. The game is due out in November. Other exclusive, unannounced titles for the Microsoft console and Kinect are also expected -- although some franchises may be holding out for a next-generation console in a year or so. While ""Halo 4"" is one of the biggest titles at E3, it is far from the only hotly anticipated game. We hope to see more from ""Assassin's Creed III"" (made by UbiSoft) and its setting in the American colonies, more from ""Dishonored"" (Bethesda) and its steampunk action, and more about ""Resident Evil 6"" (Capcom) and that game's multiplayer/co-op modes. ""There are a lot of great [big-name] games that are going to be there and be talked about,"" Herter said. ""But even the software is going to be a little less than what people expect because of the potential for next-gen consoles next year."" On the other end of the gaming spectrum, there are also plans for several new massive multiplayer online games. One, ""Defiance"" (Trion Worlds), features a unique tie-in with a new sci-fi TV series, where what happens on the show can affect what happens in the game. What we won't see at E3 . For all the hype and excitement about E3 announcements, there are some notable titles and companies that are choosing to bypass this year's event. The makers of ""BioShock Infinite,"" one of the most highly anticipated games for 2012, were originally scheduled to show off new gameplay and features. But the game's release was pushed back to February 2013, and creative director Ken Levine said the next time people will see the game is when it's ready to go in the box for delivery. ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" the latest in the blockbuster urban action series, also may skip E3. Rockstar, developer for the game, said it has no plans for the show, although some watchers speculate that could change at the last minute. Despite persistent rumors, Valve Software has said it doesn't expect to reveal any new hardware -- or popular games such as ""Half-Life 3"" or ""Portal 3"" -- next week. But Valve does plan to attend E3, and misdirection from gaming companies has been known to occur before the show. By next week at this time, we'll know much more about the best gaming has to offer for the next 12 months. Gamers, what are you hoping to see at E3? And what are you most looking forward to later this year?","The annual Electronic Entertainment Expo kicks off Monday in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- It began with a ride home from school on Tuesday, October 9. Gunmen halted the van ferrying Malala Yousafzai through her native Swat Valley, one of the most conservative regions in Pakistan. They demanded that other girls in the vehicle identify her. Malala had faced frequent death threats in the past. Some of the girls pointed her out. At least one gunman opened fire, wounding three girls. Two suffered non-life-threatening injuries, but bullets struck Malala in the head and neck. The bus driver hit the gas. The assailants got away. Malala was left in critical condition. An uncle described her as having excruciating pain and being unable to stop moving her arms and legs. Doctors fought to save her life, then her condition took a dip. They operated to remove a bullet from her neck. After surgery, she was unresponsive for three days. Photos: Malala on the road to recovery . Now, it is nothing short of a miracle that the teen blogger, who fights for the right of girls to get an education, is still alive and even more astounding that she suffered no major brain or nerve damage. In hardly more than four weeks, she went from an intensive care unit in Pakistan, showing no signs of consciousness, to walking, writing, reading -- and smiling -- again in a hospital in the United Kingdom. Less than three months after being gunned down, she was discharged from the hospital to continue her rehabilitation at her family's temporary home. Her father is now employed at the Pakistani Consulate in Great Britain. On Wednesday, doctors announced that she is expected to undergo groundbreaking surgery in Birmingham, England to repair her skull. And beyond her hospital room, a world sympathetic with her ordeal has transformed her into a global symbol for the fight to allow girls everywhere access to an education. The United Nations even declared November 10, Malala Day as a day of action to focus on ""Malala and the 32 million girls like Malala not at school."" Ex-UK PM Brown supports Malala's call for girls' education in Pakistan . The Pakistani Taliban shot Malala . Malala has encouraged girls and their families to resist the Pakistani Taliban, which pushed girls from classrooms, since she was 11. In January 2009, the militants issued an edict ordering that no school should educate girls. Malala wrote in her online diary about intimidation tactics the Taliban used in the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan to coerce girls into not going school. They included house raids to search for books, and Malala had to hide hers under her bed. The extremists took issue with her writings and threatened to kill her. ""I was scared of being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education,"" she told CNN last year. Right after her shooting, her family kept a low profile, for fear they could be next. The militants vowed that if Malala survived, they'd go after her again. ""We will certainly kill her,"" a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said. Read about the Pakistani Taliban and the faction that went after Malala . Global outpouring of support . The bloodletting sparked outrage inside Pakistan against the radical Islamist group, which continues to wield influence in parts of the country. Around the world, the young blogger has become a poster child for a widespread need to permit girls to get an education. Initially, supporters in Pakistan gathered for small vigils to pray for Malala's recovery. Government officials in Peshawar, the main city in the northwestern region where Malala is from, observed a minute of silence in her honor. Public support snowballed, and thousands of people in Pakistan and elsewhere attended rallies honoring her courage. Protesters in Karachi carried posters and banners reading: ""Malala, our prayers are with you"" and ""Shame on you, Taliban."" The airwaves filled with leaders and commentators who publicly got behind her, and journalists closely followed her story, drawing death threats from the Taliban for their coverage. Army Chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani took a stand from Malala's hospital, declaring: ""We refuse to bow before terror."" Pakistan's first female foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, decried the attempted assassination as ""a wake-up call (to) a clear and present danger."" Interior Minister Rehman Malik dubbed Malala ""the pride of Pakistan"" and announced that her local school would be renamed for her, changing from ""Khushal Public School"" to ""Malala Public High School."" Authorities in Swat renamed a college after her. Malala later requested that schools not be named for her, to prevent them from becoming prominent targets for the Pakistani Taliban. The United Nations launched a campaign for girls' education named ""I am Malala."" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack and praised Malala's cause. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commended the blogger's bravery; Actress Angelina Jolie donated $50,000 to a charity in Malala's name. And singer Madonna shouted her name from a stage, dedicating a song to her. Malik proclaimed that the two other girls injured in the attack on Malala -- Kainat Riaz Ahmed and Shazia Ramzan -- will be honored with the third-highest military award, the Star of Courage. It is not normally given to civilians. Pakistan to honor girls injured in Malala attack . Gordon Brown and Malala galvanize action . ""Pakistan has a new heroine and a new cause -- a girl's right to education,"" former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in an opinion piece published by CNN. Brown, who heads up the ""I am Malala"" campaign in his role as United Nations special envoy on global education, toured Pakistan to boost education with international funding and local initiatives. It was his office that declared Malala Day. After her shooting, Brown visited schools, including hers. He talked education for three days with Pakistan's president, Cabinet ministers, educational nongovernmental organizations, donors and a covey of U.N. charities. iReport: Girls + Education . Malala's path from near mortal wound to recovery . In addition to removing the bullet, doctors extracted a piece of skull to relieve pressure on Malala's brain because of swelling. Malala was taken by helicopter from one military hospital in Pakistan to another, where doctors placed her in a medically induced coma, so an air ambulance could fly her to Great Britain for treatment. ""She is lucky to be alive,"" Dr. Dave Rosser, the medical director of University Hospitals in Birmingham, UK, told reporters after her arrival. Then came the light at the end of the tunnel. Examinations revealed that Malala suffered no major neurological damage. More than a week after being shot a world away, Malala got back on her feet again, able to stand when leaning on a nurse's arm at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Eager to communicate, she wrote sentences on paper -- she couldn't talk at first because of a tracheotomy. ""Malala is a strong young woman and has worked hard with the people caring for her to make excellent progress in her recovery,"" Rosser said on her release. She has returned to her family and continues therapies as an outpatient at the hospital where she will undergo further surgery on her skull. Chasing the perpetrators . Malik, the Pakistani interior minister, quickly placed a $1 million bounty on the head of Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan, after he claimed responsibility for Malala's attack on behalf of the group. Police immediately took the van driver and the school guard into custody for questioning and rounded up dozens in the course of the investigation. Arrests made in shooting of Pakistani schoolgirl Malala . They have identified the shooters as two boys, but their main suspect is an adult, who the police say drove the youths to the scene -- Atta Ullah Khan, 23. All three were at large. In an interview with CNN, Khan's sister apologized to Malala for his alleged involvement. ""What he did was intolerable,"" Rehana Haleem said. ""I don't consider Atta Ullah my brother anymore."" She called Malala her sister. What's next for Malala? After regaining strength, Malala is now set to endure more surgery. Doctors at Queen Elizabeth hospital will replace the piece of skull extracted in Pakistan. Her lead doctor, Dr. Rosser, ""does not envisage any difficulties"" in a pair of operations to repair her skull or fix the hearing in her left ear, he said Wednesday. Malala is no stranger to recognition, and her ordeal has boosted it to global proportions. Pakistan's Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . She has penned her online diary in cooperation with the BBC in the past, and has spoken to other media, including CNN. At home, her writings led to her being awarded Pakistan's first National Peace Prize in late 2011. From her hospital room in the UK, Malala asked early on for her school books, so she could study for exams she wants to take when she arrives back home in Pakistan. She is all about education.

"(CNN) -- Miami is well known for its tropical weather, retiree community and Cuban-American population, but not so much as an international art hub. Luckily for downtown Miami, billionaire real-estate developer Jorge Pérez wants to change that. The real estate developer and art lover donated $40 million, half made up from his private art collection, to the Pérez Art Museum Miami, known as PAMM, one of the few major institutions in the United States with a Hispanic name. That's certainly one way to put Miami on the map. Ancient village found in Miami . Downtown Miami is in the midst of a major revitalization: David Beckham is hoping to build a stadium there for his recently announced Miami soccer team. Within the art world, the international art and fashion extravaganza Art Basel, which has taken place in Miami Beach for more than a decade, is considered to be the country's leading art fair with 130 international museum and institutions attracting tens of thousands of people to the five-day event. Jorge Pérez hopes his museum will help take Miami to the next level. ""Cultural institutions have played a critical role in the growth of Miami, with this museum as a leading example,"" Pérez said in an interview with CNN. Before Pérez was known as the ""Condo King of South Florida,"" he started as an urban planner, focusing on low-income housing developments. Then, he co-founded a real estate development firm, The Related Group of Florida, working in high-end condo construction in the 1980s. In 2005, TIME magazine named him one of the top 25 most influential Hispanics in the United States. The 64-year-old billionaire also made Forbes list of 400 richest Americans several times, the only Latino immigrant to do so. Born in Argentina to Cuban parents, Pérez grew up in Colombia before migrating to Miami as a teen. His lifelong passion for Latin American art stems from his upbringing. In his early 20s, he started collecting paintings by Roberto Matta, Diego Rivera, Wifredo Lam, and Joaquin Torres-Garcia. Now, 110 works selected by the museum from Pérez's private collection are available for everyone to see inside the three-story, 200,000-square-foot museum, designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron. Walk inside the $220 million building and you will be surrounded by tall glass windows that are said to be the largest hurricane impact resistant in the world. Hanging from every side of the museum are 70 self-watering hydroponic gardens, designed by French landscape artist Patrick Blanc. The museum focuses on international art of the 20th and 21st centuries, and is currently showing Chinese artist-activist Ai Weiwei's ""According to What?"" collection. PAMM is one of the main attractions in what was known as Bicentennial Park, now Museum Park -- which will also house the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science, set to open in 2015. The Pérez Art Museum had a smooth opening last year except for one slight hiccup: naming it. While the majority of board members voted in favor of naming the museum after Pérez, four resigned in protest. It seems they had their heart set on the ""Miami Art Museum."" That's because $100 million of the $167 million raised was city and county taxpayer money and the city of Miami donated the waterfront land where PAMM sits. Some of the board members argued the name of the museum should represent the city's central art museum. ""I cannot speak for others. However, the great majority of the board was supportive. On a board of 47, 43 voted in favor of the renaming,"" Pérez said. Pérez has been involved with the museum since well before the building project began and he said he is honored the board chose to recognize him in that way. ""I think most people want to be remembered with the causes they feel worthwhile and helped promote,"" Pérez said. It seemed odd that PAMM received its share of strife for naming it after donor when just a few years ago the Miami Science Museum's name was changed to the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science after a generous donor who gave $35 million to construct the new museum in Museum Park. ""The name change has been extremely well received by the community. Patricia and Phillip Frost are very well-liked people and they symbolize what we're about,"" said Gillian Thomas, president and CEO of Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science. When it comes to naming rights, perhaps Miami takes its art more seriously than science. ""People have opinions about art, whereas science is a bit more concrete, so there wouldn't be backlash for naming a building after a donor,"" Thomas said. But, she points out, naming Miami's art museum after Pérez carries ""a sense of pride"" for the Hispanic community, even though his art donation ""doesn't represent a collection."" ""Jorge Pérez is the first major donor from the Hispanic community,"" Thomas said. Other American art museums have been named after donors, like The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and haven't stirred any controversy. ""While people may not agree on a name,"" Thomas said, ""everyone can see that downtown Miami is quickly becoming a hub for science and art, which means donations are needed."" So far that doesn't seem to be a problem for the Pérez Art Museum; it has reached the 90% mark in its $220 million capital campaign.","The new Pérez Art Museum Miami was named after billionaire donor Jorge Pérez .

"New York (CNN) -- CNN's Lou Dobbs stepped down from his controversial role as an advocacy anchor at the network at the end of his show Wednesday night, saying he plans to seek a more activist role. ""Over the past six months, it has become increasingly clear that strong winds of change have begun buffeting this country and affecting all of us, and some leaders in media, politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem-solving as well as to contribute positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day and to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible,"" Dobbs said during his 7 p.m. broadcast. Dobbs, 64, said he had discussed the issue with CNN President Jonathan Klein, who had agreed to a release from his contract ""that will enable me to pursue new opportunities."" In a written statement, Klein called Dobbs ""a valued founding member of the CNN family."" ""For decades, Lou fearlessly and tirelessly pursued some of the most important and complex stories of our time, often well ahead of the pack,"" Klein said. ""All of us will miss his appetite for big ideas, the megawatt smile and larger-than-life presence he brought to our newsroom, and we're grateful to have known and worked with him over the years. ""With characteristic forthrightness, Lou has now decided to carry the banner of advocacy journalism elsewhere. We respect his decision and wish him, Debi [Dobbs' wife], and his family the very best."" Dobbs, who is the last of the 29-year-old network's original anchors, said he was considering ""a number of options and directions."" He cited the growth of the middle class, the creation of jobs, health care, immigration policy, the environment, climate change and the U.S. military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan as ""the major issues of our time."" But, he said, ""Each of those issues is, in my opinion, informed by our capacity to demonstrate strong resilience of our now weakened capitalist economy and demonstrate the political will to overcome the lack of true representation in Washington, D.C. I believe these to be profoundly, critically important issues and I will continue to strive to deal honestly and straightforwardly with those issues in the future."" Read Dobbs' full statement about his departure from CNN . Those issues, he added, are defined in the public arena ""by partisanship and ideology rather than by rigorous, empirical forethought, analysis and discussion,"" and he vowed to work to change that. In an e-mail to CNN staff members, Klein described the parting as ""extremely amicable,"" and said Dobbs' replacement would be announced soon. Dobbs was with Cable News Network from its initial broadcasts in 1980, acting as chief economics correspondent and host of the business program ""Moneyline."" His coverage of the 1987 stock market crash won him the George Foster Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting. That was one of many awards he received while at CNN, including an Emmy for Lifetime Achievement that he received from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2005. Dobbs left the network in 1999 to found SPACE.com, a Web site devoted to space-related subjects. He returned to the network in 2001 as anchor and managing editor of CNN's Moneyline News Hour, which became Lou Dobbs Tonight. He also acted as lead business news anchor for CNN/U.S. and CNNfn, the forerunner of CNNMoney. During his second stint at CNN, Dobbs positioned himself as ""tough, relentless, independent,"" lashing out at what he described as the deficiencies and ""partisan nonsense"" of both major political parties, and injecting advocacy journalism into his coverage of topics ranging from free trade to immigration. His no-holds-barred, sometimes acerbic style brought him a loyal following, but also attracted controversy both to him and to the network, especially over the subject of illegal immigrants. Dobbs will continue as anchor of The Lou Dobbs Show, a daily radio show that began in March 2008 and is distributed to more than 160 stations nationwide by United Stations Radio Networks Inc.","Dobbs, 64, said President Jonathan Klein agreed to release him from his contract .

"(CNN) -- We're used to our phones navigating us from one place to another, giving detailed instructions on how to find our destination in the fastest, easiest way possible. But there are a few apps that have no intention of ushering you somewhere quickly. Instead, they want to help you get out, get moving and get a little lost, hopefully discovering something new along the way. That's the idea behind an application called Dérive, which was developed by Eduardo Cachucho, an architect and lecturer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. Set up like a loosely structured game, Dérive consists of a general set of instructional cards that can be used anywhere or localized versions for select cities. They prompt the user to set out in a generalized direction, offering cryptic hints to help them along. For example, you might be instructed to ""turn left and search for something sweet,"" and then to ""keep going straight and look for a sign of hope."" That emphasis on giving a critical eye to your environment was key for Cachucho and his development partner, Babak Fakhamzadeh. ""The goal for us is to empower everyday people to understand how the urban space works,"" Cachucho said. They wanted to do it in a way that took advantage of mobile technology -- a technique that didn't initially make sense to some people. Cachucho said that one of the first reactions some people have is questioning how someone can truly appreciate the world around them with their eyes on a phone. ""I think there's a misconception that you can't interface with the two at the same time,"" he said. ""It's really based on the idea that if you give a person the tools to explore the urban space, given the right cues, it'll get someone to move in an interesting direction."" The pair also host workshops to help interested groups come up with a more location-specific deck of cards. The San Francisco set, for example, tells the player to go downtown, look for a closed store and then make a left after two blocks. It's almost like a scavenger hunt, but with the prize of seeing your environment in a new way. Similarly, an iPhone app called Serendipitor is built around the idea of taking detours from one's normal route in hopes of stumbling upon something interesting and previously overlooked. Developed by Mark Shepard, an architect and researcher who teaches at the University at Buffalo, the Serendipitor is described as an ""alternative navigation app."" Shepard originally developed the app as part of a larger project, and with funding from the nonprofit organization Creative Capital, rolled it out in 2010. Instead of cards, Serendipitor uses the familiar interface of Google Maps and adds in options for discovery to the desired route. ""I'm somebody who loves to just wander in cities,"" Shepard said. ""How can we put ourselves in situations where we might discover something new, or have an encounter which we might not have normally thought of through [navigation] technology?"" Of course, the irony, Shepard points out, is ""that we're living in an age that we're downloading an app from Apple for something as simple and human as serendipity."" Shepard isn't done tinkering with the application just yet and also wants users to be able to suggest detours for particular routes. But for those who need more of an incentive than simple discovery to get moving, Google's NianticLabs has come up with an option that a J.J. Abrams fan could love: an augmented reality game called Ingress that's played on Android phones. Unlike Serendipitor or Dérive, Ingress doesn't guide its players through a specified route. Instead, it's an open-ended game played globally between two teams -- the Enlightened and the Resistance -- who are battling to control a mysterious energy scientists have uncovered on Earth. Each team is always on the move, seeking to access ""portals"" that are found in public spaces, such as monuments, art installations, historical markers or libraries. ""The whole purpose of Niantic is to basically invent apps that are designed for the mobile experience and for the coming wearable computing experience to help people get more out of the real world when they're out,"" said Niantic's John Hanke. ""In the case of Ingress, a whole game has been created to make it fun in a different way."" As a video game fan and father of three, Hanke said he was conflicted about how stationary video and computer games are. The idea for Ingress formed when he was commuting back and forth to his old job, overseeing Google Maps and Google Earth. ""I was watching what was happening with mobile phones, and I thought, you know, there's an opportunity to take this addictive quality of video games and to marry it with mobile and break through the downside of games that they're sedentary,"" Hanke said. On the Ingress Google+ page, you can find fans who've reworked their own daily commutes to allow for a little play time. ""We have grandmothers playing and we have 6-year-olds playing,"" Hanke said. ""Walking and getting fresh air and getting that hit of adrenaline is a fun experience. A lot of people are busy and have forgotten the pleasure of that. The game has given people an excuse to walk a little bit and see their town. We're piggy-backing on the basic pleasure of being outside and exercising."" We may soon see more apps that want to derail you rather than simply plot your usual path, thanks to advancements in mobile tech. ""With wearable computing and things that you wear on your body, whether that's a bracelet that's tracking your steps or your exercise, or a watch that has your information on it, I think the hardware is evolving to things that are much more suited to using while you're out and on the move,"" Hanke said. ""The cell phone is a good intermediate step, but in the next few years I think we're going to see devices emerge that fit this idea of really moving with apps and apps that really help you when you're physically engaged and active.""","Apps such as Dérive and Serendipitor guide the user to discover new things .

"(CNN) -- Formula One legend Alain Prost has just ""one big regret"" -- his portrayal in an award winning film about his arch rival -- the late, great Ayrton Senna. Four-time world champion Prost battled the Brazilian for title supremacy while they both drove for McLaren with their rivalry reaching its peak in the finale to the 1989 and 1990 seasons . So much so that incidents on the first corner of races at Suzuka in Japan saw the pair force each other off the road. Prost was the beneficiary in 1989 after Senna, who was able to carry on, was controversially disqualified to give the Frenchman the world championship. Twelve months on, Senna's ruthless move on Prost, who had quit McLaren to drive for Ferrari, gave him the crown in a reversal of fortunes and left the men at odds. Prost, who won his final world title in 1993, had retired by the time Senna was killed at Imola in the San Marino GP of 1994. Fateful weekend . No one has died in F1 racing since that fateful weekend and it provided the producers of the movie with a chilling conclusion which left many film goers in tears as they left cinemas. But Prost, who co-operated on the award winning film ""Senna"", is unhappy that his subsequent reconciliation with Senna is not featured. ""The only regret that I have in my career is to see this kind of film that we are having on Ayrton,"" he told CNN in an exclusive interview for The Circuit. ""You need to tell everything right, correct, and you need to accept that you can have some qualities, some faults and one cannot be white and the other black. ""I am very disappointed about that because it would have been good at my age to have shown to the people, to the world, that it was a little bit different. ""But for me, inside me, I know what happened, I know the story, I know how Ayrton was just before his accident after I retired, I keep that for me. "" Senna scriptwriter Manish Pandey defended Prost's portrayal in the film but admitted it was ""very, very diffficult to compress those 10 years (of the F1 legend's career) into 100 minutes."" He told CNN: ""Alain (Prost) was very kind in giving us time and we put seven examples of reconciliation between him and Ayrton at the end of the film."" Biggest regret . Pandey also revealed that they had tried their best to insert a video clip of a lap by Senna in which he drove the Imola track and did a commentary for French TV station TF1 (for whom Alain was broadcasting) saying '""To my friend, Alain. We miss you Alain."" But the clip was muffled and unusable in the context of the end of the film, he claimed. In a doubly tragic weekend for F1 back in 1994 at that Imola race, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger had been killed in qualifying on the Saturday. Senna drove in the race with a small Austrian flag in his race suit, which he was going to wave to honor Ratzenberger, at the finish to show the unity of F1. ""If we omitted something, it was this more than anything else. And we tried to get it in, but the footage wasn't there,"" Pandey said. ""Sporting rivalries, who did what to whom, who was disqualified, who won a trophy - all of that pales into utter insignificance in the context of the bigger story. ""Senna is not a film about a sporting rivalry, because we would have called it 'Senna vs Prost' and started it later and ended it earlier, if it was. The rivalry was an important element in our story - but it was just one of many."" Prost is still intensely proud of the era which saw the pair dominate F1 racing. ""Today if you say Prost you say Senna. It is part of the F1 history and in my opinion is maybe the best years."" Different characters . In a recent poll by CNN, Prost was mentioned in dispatches by viewers in our quest to find the greatest F1 driver of all time, with Senna and Argentine maestro Juan Manuel Fangio acknowledged as the best of their eras. Prost believes that he and Senna were unwittingly the victims of their own success and did not receive the protection they deserved from the media and sponsors. ""We were very much exposed,"" said the Frenchman. ""We had a lot of people who were very interested, very motivated to have this kind of story. ""We did not realize that at the time. We just wanted to win but we had different characters and a different way of thinking and racing."" Despite the obvious dangers, Prost would not swap his experiences with those who make up the modern day F1 grid. ""If you are racing like today with almost no risk and you can continue until you are 44 or 45 years old like Michael (Schumacher), for sure it is tempting. ""You need to remember that there was a very bad period when you went out on a Sunday morning and say what's going to happen today? ""Am I going to be able to come back because we had very bad accidents, very regularly. ""I would have loved to have driven in this period, working with the engineers on the technical side, but no, I prefer my period. "" But Prost remains deeply unhappy about the balance of the Senna film and in particular the closing moments. Greatest drivers . ""What I regret is that our story was more than sport, it was also human,"" he told CNN. For all that, Pandey is convinced they did the story justice in a balanced and fair way . ""Look at their body language after Ayrton's last win at Adelaide in '93 -- warm, all smiles, a tap on the knee. Then the coming together on the podium. Then Alain's disbelief after the accident. ""Then Alain, clearly in shock, drinking a cup of water. Alain is the last and, in a way, the most important person to cross himself at Ayrton's coffin - the sadness all over his face, the badge on his lapel clearly marked 'A' (A for 'Amigo', friend) - and Alain is the main pallbearer.

"(EW.com) -- As much of the Northeast was trapped in a winter wonderland not unlike its snow-cursed setting, Disney's Frozen managed to reclaim the No. 1 spot at the box office for the first time in three weekends. The animated film took in $20.7 million, which is a nearly 28 percent drop from last week's numbers but still impressive considering it's no longer a holiday and the film is already in its sixth weekend of wide release. It's now inevitable that the Disney hit will cross the $300 million mark, as it's currently sitting pretty at $297.8 million. That's $97 million more than 2010′s Tangled --Disney's previous CG-animated adaptation of a fairy tale with a past participle for a title—made in its entire domestic run. Meanwhile, Frozen's worldwide total has reached $639.9 million. Much like the first snow, the first shameless sequel of the year is a milestone that came early in 2014. But Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, the Latino-marketed spin-off and fifth film in the popular horror franchise, couldn't quite possess the top spot with its shaky-cam scares. The movie took in $18.2 million in its opening weekend, which is a whopping 38 percent less than its predecessor Paranormal Activity 4 made in its first few days out and the lowest ever debut for a Paranormal Activity film in wide release. For the last half-decade, Paramount has been wringing this series for all its worth—Paranormal Activity 5 hits theaters this October—and the returns appear to be diminishing. Moviegoers also seem to be growing a bit tired of the movies' limited bag of tricks: Despite receiving generally better reviews than PA4, The Marked Ones rated a step down with Cinemascore, from C to C-. Still, this is a cheap goose and even if it switches from laying golden eggs to silver ones, it's fine for the studio. After three weeks at No. 1, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug tumbles like a dwarf in a barrel to third place with $16.3 million. So far, the second episode of Peter Jackson's trilogy isn't reaping quite as big a pile of gold as the first: Smaug comes out of its fourth weekend with a healthy $229.6 million, but that's still $34.2 million less than An Unexpected Journey had at this same point last year. The first Hobbit took in a grand total of $303 million domestically, which means the second one most likely won't make it past that three-double-zero mark. If that ends up being the case, it would be the first of Peter Jackson's Middle Earth films not to do so. Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street takes a decent bite out of the box office with $13.4 million, bringing the total for Martin Scorsese's coke-fueled tale of stock-pushing sybarites to $63.3 million. There's a very good chance Marty's latest will surpass Hugo's disappointing total domestic take of $73.9 million, showing Americans prefer their Scorsese to be decidedly un-family friendly. Meanwhile, David O. Russell's American Hustle, which features more than a wink to Marty's signature aesthetic, is nipping at The Wolf's back paws. It rounds out the list with $13.2 million, as Sony's critically acclaimed ensemble dissembles its way to $88.7 million. 1. Frozen - $20.7 million . 2. Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones -- $18.2 million . 3. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - $16.3 million . 4. The Wolf of Wall Street -- $13.4 million . 5. American Hustle - $13.2 million .

"(CNN) -- Japan on Tuesday unveiled its largest warship since World War II, an 820-foot-long, 19,500-ton flattop capable of carrying 14 helicopters, according to media reports. The ship, named the Izumo, is classified as a helicopter destroyer, though its flattop design makes it look like an aircraft carrier. But the Japanese Defense Ministry says the ship is not intended to be used as an aircraft carrier and will not be used to launch fighter jets, state broadcaster NHK reported. The launch of the $1.2 billion warship at a Yokohama dockyard comes at a time of increased military tensions between Japan and China over disputed islands in the East China Sea. ""The destroyer is aimed at better responding to various contingencies in waters near Japan,"" NHK reported. China on Tuesday warned Japan against any moves of military expansion, according to a report from Global Times. ""We are concerned over Japan's constant expansion of its military equipment. Japan's Asian neighbors and the international community need to be highly vigilant about this trend,"" the Global Times quoted the Chinese Defense Ministry as saying. ""Japan should learn from history, adhere to its policy of self-defense and abide by its promise to take the road of peaceful development."" Both China and Japan claim sovereignty over the rocky, uninhabited islands between Okinawa and Taiwan, which are near important shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and possible mineral deposits. They are known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. Last year, the Japanese government bought several of the islands from a private owner, angering Chinese authorities and provoking a spate of sometimes violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in many Chinese cities. Chinese government ships have continued to frequently sail near the islands, engaging in maritime games of cat and mouse with Japanese coast guard vessels. Chinese planes have also flown through the area, prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets. Tuesday's launch also came on the 68th anniversary of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima. Upwards of 60,000 people -- according to various estimates, about one-fifth of Hiroshima's population at the time -- were killed when a U.S. B-29 bomber dropped the bomb on August 6, 1945, . In remembrance ceremonies in Hiroshima on Tuesday, a list of 286,000 atomic bomb victims was presented, NHK reported. In a speech, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called on the Japanese people to always remind the world about the consequences of nuclear war, NHK reported.","820-foot-long flattop designed to carry 14 helicopters .

"(CNN) -- Tourists arriving in Bangkok may expect to see troops guarding key buildings and intersections, while masked vigilante protesters patrol their own roadblocks built from sandbags, barbed wire, rubber tires and debris. Bangkok's political violence has been escalating, and at least 21 people have died since anti-government protests began in November. Some of the capital's popular tourist areas -- including upmarket Sukhumvit Road where hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and other facilities remain open for business -- are now ground zero for the loud and crowded protests. They have blockaded some sections of Sukhumvit Road, and are also camping in nearby Lumpini Park, plus other sites. At night, gunfire and grenades echo in some central areas of Bangkok, making it unwise to stay out too late or go to places where protesters gather. Seasoned travelers should be able to figure out where and when not to go, and can follow Twitter feeds about the security situation on #Thailand and #BKKShutdown, plus many countries' online travel advisories. Dozens of countries issued travel warnings in recent weeks about Thailand, including the U.S. State Department. ""Although many protest activities have been peaceful, violent incidents involving guns and explosive devices have occurred at or near protest sites. Some have resulted in injury or death,"" advised the latest U.S. State Department warning, updated on Feb. 14. ""In Bangkok, protests have been mobile throughout the city, with large numbers of demonstrators at times swelling quickly and closing major roads and intersections,"" it said. What to expect . Travelers visiting a chaotic developing country for the first time may feel nervous when their taxi is stopped by angry masked men who might not get on well with the driver, because many taxi drivers are perceived to be against the protesters. International backpackers usually stay in Bangkok's older neighborhoods in and around Khao San Road, which has experienced unrest but is generally sheltered. In fact, most of Bangkok is safe. But it could be dangerous to voice any opinion about Bangkok's protests to Thais who visitors are not personally acquainted with. Emotions are so high that many families are now divided because of the political polarization. Tourism dipping . Bangkok's two airports, serving international and domestic airlines, are open. No foreign tourists are known to have been injured in any clashes. However, some foreigners have expressed fear after encountering tough protesters barking orders or assaulting other Thais near rally sites. The government's Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) tries to paint a pretty picture of the country's gorgeous beaches and upcountry destinations, which some travelers agree are the best places to visit now. Many tourists are flying into Thailand but not to Bangkok, and instead choose international and domestic airports in Phuket, Chiang Mai and elsewhere either by direct flights from foreign countries or changing planes in Bangkok. ""Many tour groups from Asian countries such as China, Japan, Hong Kong and Vietnam do not want to come to Thailand,"" said TAT Governor Thawatchai Arunyik, according to the Bangkok Post. ""We estimate that we will lose up to 900,000 visitors during the first half of this year,"" Mr. Thawatchai said. Security concerns and delays . Avril Lavigne played in Bangkok on Feb. 11 without problems, but Eric Clapton canceled his upcoming March 2 performance due to security concerns. Travelers who are injured or have serious health problems may experience frustration as protesters' blockades have delayed people trying to get to hospitals for emergency medical care. Thai government offices are also unable to quickly function because several ministries and other official buildings are under siege and locked by protesters, who forced officials to flee. Thai re-entry visas and extensions take more time to receive. The government however set up alternative offices in shopping malls, sports stadiums, convention centers and elsewhere to handle many of its bureaucratic backlogs. Visitors should not wear solid red-colored clothes, or buy the T-shirts now on sale in Bangkok which say ""Popcorn Army"" -- the two most inflammatory images identifying each side. Richard S. Ehrlich is a writer and journalist based in Bangkok.","Bangkok and parts of nearby prefectures remain under state of emergency following protests, violence .

"(CNN) -- Joe Simon, the co-creator of star-spangled comic book hero Captain America, has died at 98, his family announced. Simon, a writer, editor and artist, passed away late Wednesday in New York after a short illness. Simon and artist Jack Kirby, who ran a studio, developed the character in the early 1940s and worked outside the box to develop a distinct design. ""Together, the team created Captain America as well as long list of characters, including The Newsboy Legion and The Boy Commandos,"" a statement Thursday from Simon's family said. A Marvel Comics website provides a summary of Captain America and his superhero quest. ""In World War II, patriotic soldier Steve Rogers, recipient of the 'Super Soldier Serum,' became the living symbol of freedom, Captain America. Left for dead while frozen in ice, the star-spangled hero with an indestructible shield awoke years later to continue his never-ending battle for liberty."" The movie ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" was released this year. Chris Evans, in the title role, went up against villain Red Skull, played by Hugo Weaving. Kirby and Simon created Captain America for Timely Comics, Marvel's predecessor. The comic was a huge hit during World War II. With Captain America came some of Kirby's comic book innovations, Mark Evanier, author of the book ""Kirby: King of Comics,"" told CNN in 2008. Comic books, which had started as reprints of newspaper comic strips, had adhered to that form's look of repetitious boxes. Kirby and Simon used different-sized panels, varying shapes, even full pages. ""They kind of invented things that made comic books different than strips,"" Evanier said. They realized they ""had the whole page to play with. ... They'd take three or four pages for a single action scene."" The popular genres after the war were crime and horror comics, and Simon and Kirby created a handful, including the dramatically named ""Justice Traps the Guilty."" They also pioneered the romance genre, juxtaposing Kirby's innately thrilling style with primly dressed women and men in neat suits and sweaters. Simon served a few stints at DC Comics. ""Joe Simon was a true legend in the comic book industry. So much of what we are today is owed to him and his amazing creativity,"" said Dan DiDio, co-publisher of DC Entertainment. ""In addition to one of the great writers of the Golden Age, he was also an editor at DC Comics. We appreciate all of his contributions to DC Comics and the industry as a whole, both on the page and behind the scenes."" The writer's passing came a week after the death of cartoonist Jerry Robinson, who worked on the earliest Batman comics and claimed credit for creating the super-villain The Joker. Robinson was 89. Simon is survived by two sons, three daughters and eight grandchildren. CNN's Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Joe Simon, co-creator of Captain America, dies at 98 .

"(CNN) -- When the verdict came, it was as dramatic as anyone could have imagined. A late Saturday night, a courtroom of breathless people, the accused man standing, and finally the words: ""We, the jury, find George Zimmerman not guilty."" Zimmerman blinked and shook hands with his legal team. His mother smiled. His wife cried. It was over. Zimmerman fears for life . But outside, the reaction was just beginning. In the crowd milling near the court, some chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" while others spoke about the disappointment they had dreaded. An African-American man in a white shirt and gray vest stood with his arm around his young son's shoulders. ""I believe that there is a family whose heart was broken, who probably believes once again the system has failed them,"" he told CNN's David Mattingly. ""We've been praying for both families because we know that it has been a hard time for everybody that's been involved. But as far as justice ... personally, I think that the system failed the Martin family."" Common theme . Twitter erupted in disbelief. Cover Drive wrote, ""What kind of world do we live in where an innocent is killed, and the killer is found innocent?"" Scotty tweeted, ""America has given a free pass to murder Black Youth."" A Twitter user by the name Sam Is Dead echoed a common theme among those frustrated with the decision, ""Casey Anthony innocent ... Zimmerman innocent ... Mike Vick guilty... Racism."" Suspected racism in the justice system, deep-seated, secretive and historic, was the crux of the case for millions. That was what made it a national story, instead of merely a local tragedy. What led jurors to this verdict . They did not believe it was just about a 17-year-old named Trayvon Martin being shot on a rainy night. They believed it was about generations of young black men targeted, stalked, suspected and brutalized by police, security guards, neighborhood watches and courts. ""It's something bigger because Trayvon Martin is all of our sons. He's the son of all people who are African-American and of those who are conscious of what it means to be black in America,"" said Maurice Jackson, a Georgetown University associate professor of history and African-American studies. After the verdict, his message was somber. ""I feel for his parents,"" Jackson said. ""This is a sad day for democracy and for justice."" A much harsher statement came around the same time from another professor who studies race at Drexel University in Philadelphia. ""This verdict was prepared from day one,"" George Ciccariello-Maher said. ""From the media campaign of demonizing Martin, to the selection of a nonblack jury, to the instruction not to refer to race ... his was the chronicle of an acquittal foretold."" On and on the outrage went. 'Tragedy for black families' Reaction was swift, and varied. Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death . ColorOfChange.org, an online civil rights group, said it highlighted a deep-seated issue. ""This is another tragedy for black families. .. the verdict sends a clear message about the minimal value place on the lives of young black men and boys everywhere,"" the group said. Rev. Al Sharpton also weighed in. ""The acquittal of George Zimmerman is a slap in the face to the American people,"" he said. Not all agree . Despite the fury and frustration on one side of the verdict, others approved the jury's decision. ""The actual case against Zimmerman was weak. Jurors should be commended for making the right call,"" Chicago Sun-Times columnist and author, Richard Roeper, wrote on Twitter. Doesn't mean Zimmerman is 'innocent.'"" CaptYonah tweeted, ""Fact is, the evidence PROVED Zimmerman not guilty."" GreeneBri wrote, ""There is a reasonable doubt and I think our justice system did what it's supposed to do."" Many trial watchers, who suspected it would end this way, argued this case should never have been about race. It would be unfair to make George Zimmerman pay for generations of racial inequalities, no matter how real or painful those troubles may be, some said. Some suggested it was Zimmerman who was being pilloried to placate angry African-American voters and others who rallied to make the killing a cause. Trayvon's dad: My heart is broken, my faith is not . Two narratives . Defense attorney Mark O'Mara, even while speaking highly of the civil rights movement, said if his client had been black, ""he never would have been charged with a crime. It certainly would never have happened if he were black because those people who decided they were going to make him the scapegoat would not have."" His partner at the defense table, attorney Don West said, ""I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful. It makes me sad ... that it took this long under these circumstances to finally get justice."" Reconciling the two wildly disparate views of this trial is not easy. As legal analysts noted in the months leading up to the testimony, so many people made it so clear they saw the killing in substantially different ways. To one side, Zimmerman was at worst an overzealous citizen just trying to make sure his neighborhood was safe. To the other, he was a gun-toting predator, hunting, harassing and provoking a fatal fight with an innocent teen. To one side, Martin was little more than a child returning home after getting a snack. To the other, he was a hulking young man who could have gone inside, talked with Zimmerman or called the police, but instead decided to attack with his fists and paid with his life. A recap of the trial, verdict . And since people on both sides seemed to have decided the case before the testimony was heard, the verdict was bound to be disturbing no matter how it tilted. Simply put, preconceived notions effectively had people watching two different trials, with every bit of testimony and evidence producing different, and often opposing, reactions in those dueling audiences. Florida State Attorney Angela Corey, while standing with the disappointed prosecution team, seemed to tip her hat to that reality. ""I never could quite understand people, even people with law degrees, who had not read all of the police reports, who had not read all of the witness statements, yet who came up with opinions one way or the other,"" she said. But that is what happened. IT director who raised questions about case is fired . ""A race war in America is sadly alive and well,"" conservative radio host Ben Ferguson says. He's frustrated with the many celebrities, sports figures, and activists expressing outrage. ""These people do not care about the facts or respect the law. They want their form of justice and, more importantly, added fame that commenting on this case can bring. These 'professionals' are race baiting to gain a more loyal following."" With the verdict, the winning side felt that justice was served. And the other? Georgetown's Jackson summed up his thoughts. ""Like Trayvon Martin's father, my heart is broken. I am sad to say that I expected this verdict,"" he said. ""There is much to love about our country, but there are also things that happen to black people every day that make you want to put your head down and cry."" Verdict doesn't end debate in Martin's death .","NEW: ""A race war in America is sadly alive and well,"" radio host Ben Ferguson says .
The race factor propelled it into a national story .
Without the race issue, it would have been merely a local tragedy .
Despite the frustration on one side of the verdict, others approved of the jury's decision ."
"(CNN) -- Canadian police on Friday identified the victim of a grisly killing in Montreal as a university student from China who was reported missing by a friend earlier this week. Jun Lin, 33, was attending Concordia University in Montreal, said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. He was last seen May 24. Police believe the murder took place May 24 or May 25 . The Chinese consulate in Montreal said Lin was from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Police believe Lin was killed and his body dismembered in a Montreal apartment. A massive international manhunt is ongoing for the prime suspect, Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, a self-professed porn star. Before police released the name, a reader identified as lancelot16 who commented on a CNN story about Magnotta said he or she knew Lin. ""I'm a friend of the victim,"" the comment said. ""He was an international student from China. They met just weeks ago, but were starting to go out. Not his boyfriend. They had a casual relationship."" The commenter said Lin had a party at his apartment and sent his cat to a friend's house, promising to pick it up the next day. He never did. Magnotta, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, fled by plane from Montreal to Europe, Lafreniere said. That prompted Interpol, the global police agency, to alert authorities in 190 countries. Police have reason to believe Magnotta might have gone to eastern Europe, given his Russian pseudonym and writings on his Web page. Lafreniere said there was a possibility he might have re-entered Canada under another name. He said Magnotta is good at disguising himself. A 10-minute video of the killing and dismemberment was posted online. ""We believe he filmed himself,"" Lafreniere said. ""It's gross."" ""This is a very deranged person,"" he said. ""He is looking for attention and he got it, but not in a positive way."" Police began searching for Magnotta after a severed hand and foot were mailed to the Ottawa headquarters of Canada's Liberal and Conservative parties and a torso was discovered stuffed in a brand new suitcase and tossed in the trash heap of a Montreal apartment building. In apartment 208, where Magnotta lived, dried blood stained the table, the bed, the bathtub and the refrigerator. Magnotta knew Lin, Lafreniere said, but would not say with certainty what their relationship was or whether it was sexual in nature. Normally, the name of a victim would not be released in a case like this but Lafreniere said police identified Lin to put the families of other missing persons at ease. He said police would do a DNA match to get a 100% confirmation of Lin's identity. ""There are still some parts we are missing at this moment,"" Lafreniere said, adding he did not want to be disrespectful to Lin's family. The much-talked-about killing was the worst police officers in Montreal have seen in decades, Lafreniere said. The video, which police tried to take down from the Web, was back online on another site. Lafreniere said he could not understand what person could watch a human being getting decapitated in front of a camera. Magnotta's name may not have been known before this week but his digital footprints were large. He was notorious among online animal rights activists who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used the carcasses in sexual acts. He was dubbed the ""Vacuum Kitten Killer"" by a Facebook group started in December 2010 to track down the man responsible for posting a video on YouTube of kittens being killed by suffocation and drowning. ""We are patiently waiting for more information on the case and have faith in the Montreal Police,"" the website said Thursday. ""Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual, who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed. Information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in Canada, and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals."" Lafreniere said police are aware of the animal allegations. On what appears to be his own website, Magnotta defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking. ""Once and for all I will set the record straight,"" he wrote. ""Many hoax websites are created using my image and name, posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website (sic) have, I feel I don't need to list them specifically but people need not be told, not to believe what they read and to take it as fact."" The website has writing in Arabic and Russian and images of Magnotta, half naked and with lips in a perfect runway pout. Several Canadian newspapers also reported that Magnotta had dated notorious Canadian killer Karla Homolka. Lafreniere said he could not confirm any links and Homolka is not part of the investigation. Police described Magnotta as being 5 feet 8 inches tall and about 135 pounds, with black hair and blue eyes. They said they are asking the public for help in finding Magnotta, after a ""coast-to-coast"" warrant was issued for his arrest. Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he is apprehended. ""We need to bring him to justice,"" Lafreniere said.","Jun Lin, 32, was a Chinese student at Montreal's Concordia University .

"(CNN) -- There are about 500 million Buddhists worldwide, but it's unclear exactly when in history this religion began. The Buddha's life story spread first through oral tradition, and little physical evidence about Buddhism's early years has been found. Now, scientists for the first time have uncovered archaeological evidence of when the Buddha's monumentally influential life occurred. Excavations in Nepal date a Buddhist shrine, located at what is said to be the Buddha's birthplace, to the sixth century B.C. The research, published in the journal Antiquity, describes the remains of a timber structure about the same size and shape as a temple built at the same site in the third century B.C. Archaeologists also found reason to think that a tree grew at the center of this ancient structure, lending support to the traditional story that the Buddha's mother held onto a tree branch while giving birth to him. ""This is one of those rare occasions when belief, tradition, archaeology and science actually come together,"" lead study author Robin Coningham, professor at Durham University in the United Kingdom, said at a press briefing Monday. If this study is correct, the Buddha's actual life could have overlapped with a popularly recognized time frame of 563-483 B.C. But lots of other date ranges for the Buddha have been tossed around -- some scholars say 448 to 368 B.C., for instance. (The UNESCO website about his birthplace says 623 B.C.) ""We know the entirety of the shrine sequence started in the sixth century B.C., and this sheds light on a very long debate,"" Coningham said. A place for pilgrims . The Lumbini site in Nepal is one of four principal locations that are believed to be connected with the Buddha's life. Bodh Gaya is where he is became enlightened, Sarnath is where he first preached and Kusinagara is where he died. Lumbini is located in ""a subtropical chain of forests, marshes and grasslands"" between Nepal's border with India and the Siwalik Range of the Himalayas, according to the study. Historical documents from Chinese travelers show that pilgrims made the journey to Lumbini for many centuries. The site was lost and stopped attracting pilgrims after the 15th century -- no one knows why -- but Lumbini was rediscovered in 1896. It was declared the birthplace of Buddha because of a sandstone pillar there, dating from the third century B.C. The pillar's inscription states that Emperor Ashoka visited this site of Buddha's birth. Scholars say the more modern Maya Devi Temple at Lumbini, named after the mother of Buddha, was constructed on top of the foundations of more than one earlier temple or stupa, which is a dome-shaped Buddhist monument. One of those older temples dates back to the third century B.C., from the time of Emperor Ashoka. But there's also evidence of the even earlier temple, which appears to have covered about the same size and shape as the Ashokan temple, Coningham said. The earliest site . Beneath remains of the Ashokan temple, archaeologists found a series of postholes from where timber posts had rotted out. ""Indeed, our excavations have demonstrated that the earliest construction at Lumbini appears to have comprised a timber fence or railing marking a cardinal direction,"" the study authors wrote. The central, open portion of the most ancient temple appears to have housed a tree, based on the discovery of large fragments of mineralized tree roots. This part of the temple also had never been covered by a roof. To establish the dates of the earliest Buddhist shrine at Lumbini, Coningham and colleagues analyzed charcoal found within postholes, as well as sand. Different techniques used on each of these materials pointed to the same conclusion of the sixth century B.C., but the postholes indicated a range of about 800 to 545 B.C. ""If the postholes at Lumbini are indicative of a tree shrine, ritual activity could have commenced either during or shortly after the life of the Buddha,"" the study authors wrote. Julia Shaw, archaeologist at University College London, applauded the research but noted in an e-mail that other ritual frameworks existed at the same time as early Buddhism, which could complicate the conclusions of the study. ""It would be difficult to determine whether the tree shrine in question was intended for the worship of the Buddha or was part of a distinct cultic context,"" she said. But Coningham said that it's unlikely that this earlier structure belonged to a different spiritual tradition, other than Buddhism, because of the ""continuity"" of the site between the sixth century B.C. and third century B.C. structures. The Ashokan temple is clearly Buddhist, and the earlier shrine had the same footprint. ""Often when you have sites of one religious activity overtaken by another, you actually get quite dramatic changes within orientation, within use of structure,"" Coningham said. Moreover, before the sixth century B.C., the area where the site is was just cultivated land, he said. The new archaeological research on the Buddha's life will be featured in a National Geographic documentary called ""Buried Secrets of the Buddha"" premiering in February. The National Geographic Society partly funded the research. Buddhism Fast Facts . When Buddha lived . Buddha was born as Siddhartha Gautama, in the gardens of Lumbini in Nepal. His parents were wealthy. At age 29, he renounced his family and became a seeker, Coningham said. According to tradition, Buddha found truth when he sat down under a tree, which is now called the Bo tree. The Buddha happened to be born during a period of dramatic change, Coningham said. Coins were introduced, urbanization was occurring and a merchant class emerged. When the Buddha died at age 80, he recommended that all Buddhists visit Lumbini, study authors said. Today, more than a million pilgrims visit Lumbini each year. The new research, in uncovering layers of history, adds new dimensions of interest to the site.

"(CNN) -- The head of Hezbollah denied involvement Thursday in attacks this week on Israeli targets in India, Georgia and Thailand. ""We are not afraid to say that we had nothing to do with these explosions,"" Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address from an undisclosed location in Lebanon. He denied that the death of a Hezbollah commander in 2008 in an explosion in Damascus, Syria, inspired the attacks. ""The blood of Imad Mogniyeh will always haunt the Israelis,"" he said, referring to the commander whose death Hezbollah blamed on Israel, and Israeli denied. Hezbollah has longstanding close ties with Iran and Syria. ""It is quite insulting to accuse Hezbollah of plans to kill average Israeli civilians in retaliation of killing our leaders,"" Nasrallah continued. ""Those who we will take our revenge from know themselves very well and they will need to keep taking precautions for their safety."" Hezbollah is a Shiite Muslim group active in Lebanon that the United States views as a terrorist organization. Nashrallah's remarks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Tehran for the attacks. ""Iran is a threat to the stability of the world; they are targeting innocent diplomats,"" he said. ""The international community has to denounce the Iranian actions and to indicate red lines concerning the Iranian aggression."" But Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, ""condemned the blasts and said that Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts,"" Iran's state-run Press TV said on its website. And state-run Iranian news agency IRNA quoted an analyst as saying the Israeli allegations against Iran involving the bombings in India and Thailand represent ""a prelude to terrorist attacks against the Islamic Republic."" Thai state-run MCOT Television said Thursday that the country's criminal court had issued arrest warrants for four Iranians on charges related to Tuesday's Bangkok bomb incidents. The approval came after police submitted closed-circuit television pictures, explosive devices seized from their rented house and testimony of witnesses, MCOT reported. Thai authorities said they are holding three Iranian suspects -- Saeid Moradi, 28, whose legs were blown off by his own bomb -- and Mohammad Hazaei, 42, who was taken into custody Tuesday at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport as he tried to board a plane to Malaysia. Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, 31, was arrested Wednesday by Malaysian authorities in Kuala Lumpur, MCOT said. All three face charges that include joint assembling of explosive devices, joint possession of explosive devices without permits and causing an explosion injuring other persons. Moradi also faces charges of attempted killing of state officials on duty and the intentional attempted killing of other persons, it said. A fourth Iranian, a woman identified as Rohani Leila, remained at large. She is suspected of renting the house where the first device exploded, apparently by accident, MCOT said. A Thai police official said Wednesday that Israeli diplomats were the intended target of the Bangkok blasts. ""I can tell you that the target of the operation of this group is specifically aimed at Israeli diplomats,"" Police Gen. Priewpan Damapong told CNN affiliate Channel 3. His comments came after a senior Thai security official had drawn a tentative link between the Bangkok blasts and attacks aimed at Israeli officials in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the explosive devices were similar. Last month, Thai authorities charged a Lebanese man they said they believed was a member of Hezbollah with possession of explosive materials. The police charged the man, Atris Hussein, after finding outside Bangkok ""initial chemical materials that could produce bombs."" The authorities said they believed Hussein was trying to attack spots in Bangkok popular with Western tourists. In the events Monday, a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi exploded, wounding four people. Another device, found on an embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, was safety detonated. Indian police said Thursday that they have not established an Iranian tie to the New Delhi bombing. The materials used in the Bangkok bombs were similar to those used in India, the Thai National Security Council said. Analysis: Was Iran behind the Bangkok bombings? The attacks and accusations come amid tensions between Israel and Iran. Israel had made clear it is considering attacking Iran's nuclear facilities. Israel, the United States and other countries have expressed concern that Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons, despite Tehran's insistence that its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes. Iranian officials have openly antagonized Israel, and Israeli officials have described the regime in Tehran as an existential threat.

"(CNN) -- Sometimes I wonder -- am I done parenting yet? My daughters are out of the house, and (almost) out of grad school. They know all about the birds and the bees. The last thing I should be worrying about is their sex lives. When your kids are 23 and 26, the operative words are: ""Butt out."" Looking back, I can say in full confidence that I taught them well about sex: Be responsible for your actions and protect yourselves. Say no if you want to. Tell me just enough, but not too much. The goal is to forge a meaningful relationship with someone who is both lover and friend. That was before ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" came along. My daughters didn't have the patience to read the novel, as famous for its female fans as for its pathetic prose. Chances are, though, they'll go see the movie, slated for release on Valentine's Day. They admit, the catchy, sexy trailer piqued their interest. All the buzz about the movie brings up a dilemma for me as the parent of two girls who are grown, but still forming their sexual identities: Do I really want my daughters seeing a warped, sadomasochistic relationship, dressed up as a Hollywood love fantasy? I'm no prude, mind you. As a parent, I'm chill, I'm open. But the idea that my daughters would see the romance in ""Fifty Shades"" as something to be aspired to makes me just a little uncomfortable. I had the passing thought that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" could be a learning experience. But then I woke up and thought: not for my kids!â€¯ Here I am trying to teach my daughters to be strong women and look at sex in a healthy way. Now they're being told that for a woman, the secret to really great sex is pain, and plenty of it. Who's in the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' cast? Plenty of people are hating on the film's ultraviral trailer -- perhaps for the wrong reasons. These critics think the stars aren't attractive enough, old enough, or edgy enough. Some say leading man Jamie Dornan, especially, doesn't seem ""in charge"" enough to play sadistic-sexy Christian Grey. Even the bondage community doesn't seem particularly happy about the book or movie. In anonymous Internet murmurings, some say despite all the trappings, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" depicts an assault on a woman, rather than consensual bondage. Still, the mere appearance of the trailer set ""Fifty Shades"" fans aquiver. It got 25 million YouTube views in just the first three weeks. The slick, highly produced trailer, complete with soundtrack by Beyonce, appeals to the younger female demographic, says one film industry analyst. ""They're going to totally chase the female millennial audience, no doubt about that,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Rentrak. ""If you look at the number of tweets, the prerelease buzz surrounding this movie, it's almost like how 'Sex and the City' was for young women. It's almost like their 'Star Wars.'"" Psychologist Lucie Hemmen, author of ""Parenting a Teen Girl: A Crash Course on Conflict, Communication, and Connection with Your Teen Daughter,"" agrees the movie seems to be targeting a young female audience. ""The male lead is pretty and nonthreatening, even though we're clear he has his 'naughty' side. Young women audiences gravitate toward pretty male singers and actors. Just check out who's selling music and movies to young women and you're going to encounter a sea of pretty men."" And what is the film telling its potentially young, overwhelmingly female audience? That submission is the ultimate goal? That's certainly at odds with what I've tried to instill in my daughters -- express yourself, be strong and don't let anyone make you do anything you're not comfortable with. Hemmen also has her doubts. ""I do think that it insidiously affects young women, by kind of creating this super, super expanded idea about sex,"" Hemmen says. ""This movie is clearly going to depict a sexual relationship that is out of the box. I think it's better for young people to establish their identity in their own box before they go outside of it to explore Hollywood ideas of what sexuality is."" ""As a psychologist, I would be more concerned about a young woman with less maturity, self-knowledge and clarity exploring the behavior, potentially to please a partner or as a way of acting out poorly understood psychological pain/confusion. In such cases, sexual shame could be triggered and emotional turmoil could follow."" Explaining the wild success of 'Fifty Shades' It's for that reason that Hemmen says she'd rather her 16-year-old daughter not see the movie. ""My 20-year-old can do what she wants. She's been in the culture long enough to roll her eyes and laugh at it."" In other words: What's the big deal? It's not like young women look up to Anastasia Steele, the ""Fifty Shades"" heroine. ""She's not really a role model,"" my 23-year-old says. ""People are exposed to things at a much different speed in this day and age than in the past,"" says Lauren Howard, a psychotherapist and clinical social worker. ""At the end of the day, everything is OK between consenting adults. Is there a reason for young girls, specifically, to not see this stuff? The answer is, it really depends on the girl."" Perhaps, Howard says, the sadomasochism scenes in ""Fifty Shades"" will prove more challenging for a male audience. ""It's more intimidating to men than to women. It portrays a sexual man as someone who acts that way,"" she adds. ""They might end up going to the movie with their girlfriend, hoping for soft porn. But that's not what they're going to get. What they're going to get is much more demanding."" Very little is really, truly, off limits these days. Girls much younger than my daughters will surely find a way to see ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" -- either in theaters, on cable, or online. What's unknown is just how profoundly it will affect their emerging sexuality. My daughter's 21-year-old roommate, Gabby Battistiol, is a big fan of ""Fifty Shades"" and other romance and erotic novels. Gabby found the trailer disappointing. ""I just don't think the actors seem like they're really into this. It's almost like they PG-13'd it."" Meaning, it's not dirty enough? No, Gabby says. ""I think they're trying to get the 15-year-old girls who are obsessed with 'Twilight.' It brings up this whole fangirl thing. The same girls that like Justin Bieber, like 'Twilight.' I'm concerned about it becoming something that it's not. The sex is more than the love. That's what I like about the book,"" she says.â€¯""Now they're going to make it into a movie, they're going to idolize (Christian Grey), but in reality, he still likes pain."" My youngest daughter is all in. ""Everyone's obsessed with this."" She admits the movie wouldn't be as popular if the lead roles were reversed, with the man submissive to the woman. ""We live in a society that caters to male pleasure,"" she expounds. When I asked if it mattered to her if I didn't want her to go, she shot back: ""You? No."" How's that for a slap in the face?","One parent questions the submissive goal of ""Fifty Shades"" for her daughters .

"(CNN) -- Is it a response to a potential genocide or an opening to take on the Sunni Islamic extremists rampaging through Iraq? President Barack Obama's decision to authorize airstrikes escalated American military involvement in Iraq, a country he tried to get out of more than two years ago. The first U.S. attacks happened Friday, with F/A-18 jets bombing mobile artillery batteries of ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State. While the administration adamantly reassures Americans that it won't put U.S. boots on the ground, it also has made a compelling case for going after the ISIS threat. 1. Signs of genocide . Obama and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights talk of potential genocide and crimes against humanity if ISIS fighters slaughter minority groups fleeing them in the north. In particular, tens of thousands of Yazidis, a religious minority in the north, have fled into mountains where they lack food and services and remain vulnerable to the ISIS rampage. ""Convert to Islam or die"" is the ISIS ultimatum, as given to Christians when the group overran that minority's largest city, Qaraqosh. A senior U.S. administration said ISIS backs up its threat by beheading people with differing religious convictions and putting the heads on spikes to terrorize others. The extremists have also uploaded execution videos to the Internet. The militants' carnage has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, especially from Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. In addition, thousands of Yazidi families are stranded, and two U.S. military cargo planes airdropped 5,300 gallons of water and 8,000 meals to them Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that ISIS' ""grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide."" 2. Protect U.S. interests and personnel . ""We do whatever is necessary to protect our people,"" Obama said Thursday night in announcing his authorization of airstrikes. ""We support our allies when they're in danger."" Those two principles sum up the reasons for what he did. There are hundreds of military personnel in Iraq, many of them advisers sent to work with Iraqi and Kurdish military officials in response to the ISIS threat. Dozens of them are in Irbil, the largest city of the Kurdish region, which has been one of the most stable regions in Iraq and a cooperative U.S. partner. U.S. consular staff are there with them. Friday's initial airstrikes hit ISIS artillery outside Irbil, according to the Pentagon. Kurdish officials say their fighting force, the Peshmerga, can hold off an ISIS advance, but the militants have weapons taken from Iraqi forces in areas they've already overrun. They have wrested Kurdish towns from the Peshmerga. 3. Take on the extremists . Obama continues pushing for a political solution in Iraq, saying U.S. military action can't solve the conflict. But when asked why the United States was not evacuating American personnel, a senior administration official said the United States has the wherewithal to protect them and prefers instead to ""lay down a marker"" before ISIS. Hawkish critics in Washington agree the United States doesn't want another war in Iraq, but they say America can do more. ""Degrade ISIS"" was the dictum from Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. ""It is inherently expansionist and must be stopped."" They suggest a take-it-to-them formula: Arm all partners who fight ISIS, including in Syria, and bomb their leaders, troops and positions, including in Syria. The Obama administration has pushed for Iraqis to form a new government more representative of Iraq's Sunni Muslims than currently exists under Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Many disaffected Sunni Muslim have joined ISIS. Then the White House wants Iraqi military forces to handle the threat. Map: Where is ISIS? CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Administration concerned about possible ""genocide"" as a result of ISIS .

"(EW.com) -- Gleeks have to wait another eight days to see ""Glee's"" season 4 premiere, but Wednesday fans were treated to a taste of the music that the New Directions will be serenading us with this year. Wednesday evening, the ""Glee"" Facebook page featured a streaming presentation with five songs from the first two episodes of the season, all introduced by Darren Criss (Blaine) and Kevin McHale (Artie). No peeks at footage of the dance numbers for these songs, but the music was backed by stills from the new season. EW tuned in to the stream, so if you missed it, we have the details on the music coming to the Fox musical show in the coming two weeks: . Mash-up of Lady Gaga's ""Americano"" and Jennifer Lopez's ""Dance Again,"" sung by Kate Hudson . Rachel's nasty new dance teacher, played by Kate Hudson, must have been blessed with good vocal chords as well as nice legs. In the most danceable song of the five Glee songs previewed today, this mash-up features a sultry Hudson, who may have mastered a Spanish accent a little better than Lady Gaga did. Imagine Dragon's ""It's Time,"" sung by Darren Criss . Ladies (and gentlemen!), prepare yourselves for some more Blaine Anderson-induced swooning. Criss will sing this hit by the Las Vegas-based up-and-coming band Imagine Dragons. It starts off instrumentally minimal, with one plucky guitar and some claps and foot-stomping providing the percussion. Then the song fills out during the chorus as strings and piano come in for the winning cover. Mash-up of Britney Spears' ""Boys"" and Justin Bieber's ""Boyfriend,"" sung by Darren Criss and Kevin McHale . Time to channel your inner boy band, Artie and Blaine! For the Criss and McHale's first duet on the show, Glee is delivering yet another mash-up, this time bringing together the music of a longtime pop queen and today's pop prince for the show's second Britney Spears-themed episode. Criss revealed that they were directed to make the number ""as cheesy and boy band as possible."" He and McHale even gave fans tuned into the stream a ""boy band pose,"" chins out, eyes squinted, pouty lips slightly parted. Let's hope there's plenty more where that came from when the mash-up airs next week. Britney Spears' ""Gimme More,"" sung by Heather Morris . There's not a lot new or innovative as far as Glee's cover of this song goes, but it sounds like the dance moves that accompany it will be unmissable. Chord Overstreet appeared in the live stream to help introduce ""Gimme More,"" also set for the Britney Spears episode. He gave us this tease about the scene for this song: ""We're all dancing in it and shaking our rumpeses."" Singing this one is Glee's very own Brittany S. Pierce, Heather Morris. Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe,"" sung by the Glee cast . Last but certainly not least, we got to hear the song of the summer â€” the ubiquitous ""Call Me Maybe"" â€” sung by an ensemble of Glee cast members. Count on it having as much energy as a car- or plane-ful of collegiate or Olympic athletes belting out the catchy pop song.

"(CNN) -- Recently, Obama told Hollywood that America is not cool with itself. Speaking at the home of Walt Disney executive Alan Horn, he looked into the eyes of stars like Barbra Streisand and James Brolin and said that the country is full of ""disquiet,"" that the future risks ""more cynicism, more dysfunction,"" and that ""we have a Washington that's not working."" In the distance, a car alarm went off. The President quipped, ""Sound the alarm, because we've got a problem."" There was a lot of predictable gloom in those remarks, given the President's low approval rating, but also a surprising lack of self-awareness. If Obama has proved to be a disappointment then Hollywood is partly responsible for all the unrealistic ambitions that have surrounded him. And there's big irony in the fact that he is now seeking comfort from the very liberal elite that he once seemed to challenge. Back in the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hollywood was solid Clinton country; it only rallied to Obama after he snagged the nomination. After he won the White House, there were two years of mutual snub between L.A. and D.C. Not only did some moviemakers gripe that the President was a reluctant reformer (remember Matt Damon or Robert Redford or remind yourself of when Obama was still anti-gay marriage), but he rarely called people to say ""thank you"" for everything they've done for him. Hollywood might tolerate inaction, but it can't abide the absence of flattery. So how did Obama change his mind about Hollywood? The change occurred thanks to the rise of the tea party, which galvanized West Coast liberals, and the President's sudden conversion to the legalization of gay marriage, which happen to come at a time when local reports indicated that his Hollywood money was in danger of drying up. Almost overnight, Hollywood assumed a structural importance in his re-election campaign to rival that of organized labor, liberal PACs or even the DNC. Here's another irony: Hollywood benefited from the changes to campaign finance that many stars protested against. Citizens United allowed moviemakers to act as bundlers, buying them new levels of access and influence. This corresponded with a subtle change in the way that Obama was sold to the voter. In 2008, he was the outsider offering change (although the famous ""Yes We Can"" video was a 100% Hollywood product produced by Bob Dylan's son, Jesse). Come 2012, he now represented various faces of liberal authority -- many of them defined by Hollywood archetypes. For example, there was an experiment in reinventing Obama as Atticus Finch, the lawyer played by Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Obama gave a televised introduction to the movie on the USA Network channel in 2012. Film critic Tom Shone noted that Obama wanted the viewer to imagine that he was ""cut from exactly the same liberal oak as Peck's Atticus Finch (retrenching) Obama's status as the defender of the mainstream."" Defender, too, of law and order. For the release of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" the White House publicized a photo of Obama and Biden with the tagline, ""The Dynamic Duo,"" capitalizing upon the plotline of a caped crusader protecting an American city against a greedy villain who bore almost the same name to the company that Mitt Romney set up -- Bane/Bain. And once the election was over, the first movie that Obama showed in the White House was Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" with its equally prescient synopsis of a President who overcomes partisan divisions to bring social justice to America. ""I never compared myself to Lincoln"", Obama told David Gregory on ""Meet the Press."" But he did film a metajoke for the White House Correspondents Dinner in which he played Daniel Day-Lewis preparing to play Obama in a biopic spoof of Lincoln. Alas, Barack Obama is no Lincoln. Honest Abe may have had the power to make the opposition vote his way, but when Obama invited congressional Republicans to attend the showing of Spielberg's movie, not one of them turned up. That's typical. When the President threw a barbecue for newly elected House Republicans, only one third showed, and John Boehner has set a record for dodging state dinners. Once, Obama eschewed connection with the Hollywood liberal establishment. Now he relies upon it for money, for selling Obamacare to voters and -- most importantly -- for helping to define a shifting image of what he wants his presidency to be. There is nothing unusual in this. Richard Nixon used John Wayne to define his foreign policy, Ronald Reagan's Western swagger was pure Hollywood invention. But this kind of celluloid fantasy-making is far from healthy. Congress isn't a place that can be navigated by idealism; a dangerous world cannot be managed with superhero theatrics (such as drone strikes). Expectations are raised excessively by promising to solve all these problems with the same ease that they do in the movies. Moreover, talking in clichÃ©s encourages partisanship. While the Democrats cling to being Jed Bartlets, the Republicans see themselves as Men With No Name -- and there's little common ground that can be reached between people competing to be more stubbornly archetypal than the rest. Where do you retreat to when your policies fail and the partisanship grows deafening? Your base. After a term and a half of promising to be a different kind of Democrat, to change things, to reshape politics for ordinary people -- Barack Obama finds himself seeking comfort in the audience of old-fashioned, dare I say ""fading,"" liberal stars like Barbra Streisand. Hollywood might still imagine him to be a superhero, but Obama has really become the thing that in 2008 he set out to avoid: another Clinton Democrat.","Timothy Stanley: If Obama is a disappointment, Hollywood is partly to blame .

"(EW.com ) -- For the past seven years, the final scene of ""The Sopranos"" has had viewers and fans scratching their heads over what the heck happened. It was perhaps the most divisive series finale of all time, leading legions of people to think their televisions went out and spawning a plethora of close readings of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'.""

"(CNN) -- A Nevada man accused of viewing pornography and fondling himself aboard a Southwest flight was arrested, federal authorities announced Monday. Daniel Drinan, 63, was taken into custody Saturday night at Denver International Airport on charges of committing lewd, indecent or obscene acts in public aboard an aircraft, the U.S. Justice Department said Monday in a news release. Drinan appeared Monday in a Denver court, where he was advised of his rights and appointed an attorney, said Justice Department spokesman Jeffrey Dorschner. Federal prosecutors did not ask that Drinan be detained and the judge let him walk free on personal recognizance -- and on the condition that he not fly, including to future court appearances -- said Dorschner. The arrest followed a Saturday night flight between Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland and Denver. An affidavit filed in conjunction with the criminal complaint states that Drinan sat down, hooked up his laptop computer to the airline's Wi-Fi Internet service and began viewing pornography. A person seated nearby noticed a man fondling himself and ultimately alerted a flight attendant, the Justice Department said, citing the affidavit. A male flight attendant arrived and, after finding the suspect's genitalia exposed, told him to ""put his pants back together,"" according to the federal department. Drinan allegedly tried to use his laptop at times to hide his activity, investigators said. He is scheduled to be arraigned on September 19, according to Dorschner. Drinan's location could not be confirmed Monday night, nor could it be determined which attorney was representing him. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Denver Police Department are investigating the case, with Assistant U.S. Attorney James Allison in charge of the prosecution, according to the Justice Department. If convicted, Drinan could be sentenced to as many as 90 days in jail and be compelled to pay a $250 fine.","Daniel Drinan, 63, was arrested Saturday after his Southwest flight landed in Denver .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- As the Ukrainian military warns of plans to assault this rebel-controlled city, separatist militants are thinning on the streets and their leaders are canceling public appearances. Government security officials said Monday they were preparing for a ""massive assault"" on Donetsk, state media reported. Inside the city, shelling has already pushed some residents underground into cellars and half-built basements. In a dim labyrinth beneath a government building, dozens of women and children sleep on mattresses they carried below ground to take shelter from the violence. They say they believe separatists who have told them the Ukrainian army are American-backed fascists, set on attacking ethnic Russians. ""They crush us, the damn Americans. What are they doing? Where there is war in the world, they have a part,"" one woman said. Above ground, the grief and anger are more vivid, near where a school was hit. ""They are unworthy, because they are fascists, the government, why do they have to shoot innocent people?"" resident Svetlana Ivanovna said. Rima Denisovna returned home Monday to find glass covering her bed. Ukraine's army has used a lot of artillery in its fast advance, but it's unclear who fired the shells here that shattered her windows.

Hamilton clocked a fastest lap of one minute, 38.338 seconds but was made to sweat by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas who looked set to trump that time only to skid off at the very end of the third qualifying run. The slip ensured the Finn finished third fastest behind Hamilton's teammate and title rival Nico Rosberg. McLaren's Jenson Button will begin the race from fourth position ahead of the Toro Rosso of home favourite Daniil Kvyat who edged out Kevin Magnusson of McLaren and Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull. ""Pole is a great place to start,"" Hamilton told the waiting press after coming off the track. ""It wasn't the easiest of sessions. Rosberg and Bottas were looking quite strong and hooking up a good lap wasn't the same as practice. It will be tough tomorrow in the race. It is a long way down to turn one. We'll see how that works out."" Elsewhere on the track, Fernando Alonso clocked the eighth fastest time just ahead of Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen. Four-time world Champion Sebastian Vettel, meanwhile, will start in eleventh position after failing to make the final qualifying run. ""I wasn't comfortable in the car today. It was very difficult,"" Vettel said. ""The car felt nervous, so I couldn't take the speed into the corners, I lost the rear many times around the lap and therefore wasn't quick enough."" The day's qualifying took place under calm, sunny conditions that were in stark contrast to the heavy rain a week earlier in Japan that led to Marussia driver Jules Bianchi suffering a severe head injury. The 25-year-old Frenchman remains in hospital in Yokkaichi and a number of drivers spoke earlier this week about the difficulty of competing again so soon after such a traumatic incident. Hamilton said he was praying for the Frenchman while all 21 drivers have put the words ""Tous avec Jules #17"" on their helmets this weekend to show their support. Bianchi's Marussia teammate, Max Chilton, took to the track Saturday but finished the day in 21st position and will start last on the grid Sunday. He later described the emotions he and his team felt and the difficulties of trying to focus on racing under the circumstances. ""(It's been) a tough weekend and one that hasn't got any easier as we've progressed towards the race,"" Chilton said. ""I'm grateful for having the whole Team around me as I think that it is helping all of us to focus. ""Performance-wise, we didn't get the qualifying position we wanted today, but there are some reasons for that. ""We'll keep pushing hard this evening, and do our best to get ahead of the Caterhams tomorrow, but the fact is, it's not the same without my teammate.""","Hamilton claims pole position in Russian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Vermont's House and Senate voted Tuesday to override the governor's veto of a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in the state. Demonstrators in Iowa celebrate that state's approval of same-sex marriage on Friday. The Senate voted 23-5 to override Gov. Jim Douglas' veto, according to the Senate office. Shortly afterward, the House overrode the veto on a 100-49 vote. The votes surpassed the number needed -- two-thirds of those present -- to override the veto. The action makes Vermont the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriages. The others are Massachusetts, Connecticut and, as of last week, Iowa. Douglas vetoed the bill Monday. ""Vermont's civil union law has afforded the same state rights, responsibilities and benefits of marriage to same-sex couples,"" the governor wrote in a letter to David Gibson, secretary of the Senate. ""Our civil union law serves Vermont well, and I would support congressional action to extend those benefits at the federal level to states that recognize same-sex unions. But I believe that marriage should remain between a man and a woman."" Tuesday's votes end a 10-year battle to legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont despite a court ruling legalizing civil unions, according to CNN affiliate WPTZ-TV. Same-sex marriages will become legal on September 1. Following the House vote, corridors of the legislative building filled with jubilant supporters, some embracing and others talking on cell phones to spread the news, WPTZ said. ""We haven't decided who's going to propose to who yet,"" said one man, standing with his partner. The couple told WPTZ they will have been together 25 years in September. The Human Rights Campaign, which describes itself as the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization, issued a statement applauding the votes, noting Vermont is the first state to legalize same-sex marriage through the legislative process. ""This historic vote in the Vermont Legislature reminds us of the incredible progress being made toward equality,"" said Joe Solmonese, Human Rights Campaign president, in the statement. ""Less than five years ago, lesbian and gay couples began marrying in Massachusetts. Now, with the Iowa court decision last Friday and today's vote in Vermont, there will be four states recognizing the right to marry for loving, committed lesbian and gay couples."" Vermont Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin was quoted in the statement as saying, ""The struggle for equal rights is never easy. I was proud to be president of the Senate nine years ago when Vermont created civil unions. Today we have overridden the governor's veto. I have never felt more proud of Vermont as we become the first state in the country to enact marriage equality, not as the result of a court order, but because it is the right thing to do."" Vermont's neighboring state, New Hampshire, also has taken steps toward legalizing same-sex marriages. On March 26, the New Hampshire House passed a bill by seven votes that would legalize same-sex marriage, sending it to the Senate, according to the Concord Monitor newspaper. New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch has said he opposes same-sex marriage but has not said whether he will veto a bill legalizing it. Like Vermont, New Hampshire allows civil unions for same-sex couples. ""The civil unions bill [Lynch] signed into law prevents discrimination and provides the same legal protections to all New Hampshire families to the extent that is possible under federal law,"" Lynch spokesman Colin Manning told the Monitor. On Friday, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a state law banning same-sex marriage. The decision upheld a 2007 ruling by a lower court that struck down Iowa's 1998 law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples. Polk County District Judge Robert Hanson found that the law violated the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection and hurt gay and lesbian couples ""in numerous tangible and intangible"" ways.","Vermont House and Senate voted Tuesday to override governor's veto of bill .

"Washington (CNN) -- The new Army chief of staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, says there would be risks in leaving a large force of U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the present withdrawal deadline of the end of the year. Odierno, who has served as commander of multinational forces in Iraq, said a large American force could provoke new claims of U.S. occupation and distract from important efforts to develop the Iraqi military's abilities. ""I always felt we had to be careful about leaving too many people in Iraq,"" Odierno said Thursday in a question-and-answer session with journalists at the Pentagon. He would not comment directly on reports that the Obama administration has decided on leaving 3,000 to 5,000 troops, should Iraq make a formal request for them. ""What I would say is there comes a time, and I've said it before, when it becomes counterproductive,"" he said. ""So we've got to decide what that right number is."" The general, who served more than four years in Iraq in a variety of roles, said the United States is leaving equipment in Iraq, and transition and training on that equipment, as well as other training for Iraqi troops, has not been completed. ""We need to probably be there to assist them at certain levels for a while,"" Odierno said.","Gen. Ray Odierno wants to avoid accusations of U.S. occupation .

"(CNN) -- Sawyer Jones kept asking if the tigers could get out of their enclosure. The 3-year-old boy was with his family at the San Francisco Zoo on Tuesday to enjoy a brisk holiday morning with the animals. A tiger dozes in the sun as Matthew Jones poses with his son Sawyer during their zoo visit Tuesday. Sawyer's father, Matthew Jones, said he was sure the tigers couldn't escape from their zoo exhibit. He never could have guessed it would really happen. Just a day after a tiger mauled one person to death and injured two others at the zoo, the elder Jones, of Menlo Park, California, was in shock. ""I assured him they couldn't,"" Matthew Jones said. ""I felt no reason for concern. I'm very curious to find out how the animal got out."" The family visited the zoo Tuesday morning and left before 1 p.m. The coincidence was unsettling. ""We couldn't believe that we were there just a few hours earlier,"" Matthew Jones said. The deceased victim has been identified as 17-year-old Carlos Sousa of San Jose, California, the San Francisco medical examiner's office said Wednesday. Matthew Jones said that after many trips to zoos around the country, he thought this zoo was ""perfectly adequate"" and saw nothing odd about it. He also thought it was highly unlikely that a huge tiger would be able to climb out of the enclosure. View CNN.com readers' photos of the tiger exhibit » . Other zoo visitors weren't so sure. Jina S., of San Jose, is questioning the nervous jokes she used to make about the tigers trying to jump out. Jina said she had always felt slightly uneasy about the pit surrounding the exhibit. She and her husband made comments about the tigers in the enclosure during their December 1 visit. ""When we were there, we were discussing how it wasn't much of a stretch that they could jump over that gap,"" she said. ""We were joking at the time, and it's horrible it happened to [Sousa]."" But Jen Williams of Hollister, California, said she felt safe during her June 2007 visit and didn't think the animals could jump over anything. She says that keeping animals in zoos brings some risk to what is generally a safe environment. ""It's always scary when you go someplace where there's large animals in captivity,"" she said. Steven Arnold of Mountain View, California, echoed Williams' sentiments and said tigers are wild animals that can do wild things, even in captivity. He has been going to the zoo for years and said he always thought it was theoretically possible for the tigers to escape their exhibit. ""They're pretty spectacular animals when you see them up close,"" Arnold said. ""They're huge. They don't remind you much of a house cat when you're seeing them up close."" As at several other zoos, patrons are invited to watch the tigers get meaty meals. Arnold describes the feedings as ""a big spectacle"" where visitors can get fairly close to the animals. Tigers' animal instincts become more apparent at these events, he said. ""[Zookeepers] feed them raw meat,"" Arnold said. ""They definitely give you the impression of being wild animals."" Reflecting on the mauling, Williams said she will continue to go see the animals and added that she's observed that renovations go on all the time. ""I guess it's just a risk you take, but it's very sad."" E-mail to a friend .","Siberian tiger escapes pen at San Francisco Zoo on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Three dead bodies, 20 to 30 missing limbs, and more than 180 injured can force us to revisit that age-old question: What is the state of man's nature? Is he inherently good or evil? The Boston Marathon bombings have presented us with the dilemma of Locke versus Hobbes again. Pictures like this tempt us to adopt Hobbes' pessimistic view of man. But it's wrong. Events such as this, or rather men responsible for events such as this, don't define us. Actor Patton Oswalt, in a Facebook post that I'm sure has virally made it to your screen, put it perfectly: . ""If it's one person or a HUNDRED people, that number is not even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the population on this planet."" And: ""The vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evil doers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak. This is beyond religion or creed or nation. We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil. We'd have eaten ourselves alive long ago."" And more: ""So when you spot violence, or bigotry, or intolerance, or fear, or just garden-variety misogyny, hatred or ignorance, just look it in the eye and think, 'The good outnumber you, and we always will.' "" Exactly. At least, that's what I think. What about you? Which is it? Is man inherently good or evil? It's an admittedly oversimplified question. But how you answer it dictates what you do next. Carlos Arredondo, Jeff Bauman define us . Carlos Arredondo is being hailed as a cowboy-hatted hero. He is. With the bomb blasts still ringing in his ears, Arredondo dove into the carnage and began to help victims. He is extraordinary. I think he says more about us than whoever dropped a pressure cooker at the marathon on Monday. It's Jeff Bauman, though, whom I keep thinking about. Bauman is the man who was standing on Boylston Street watching his girlfriend run the Boston Marathon. Bauman is the man who in one moment was standing with youthful invincibility and two legs. And in the next moment, he was lying without legs. He's the man Arredondo stayed with until he was in an ambulance. There's something about these two men, this moment that defines us. Yes, it's Arredondo's heroism. But it's also Bauman's gaze. He's literally three-quarters the person he was minutes before. And yet he almost calmly looks forward.

"(CNN) -- United Nations inspectors are heading to Iran Sunday to visit a uranium mine in Yazd and a uranium-thickening plant in Ardakan, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported. It's the seventh such trip in recent months. The inspection comes as a May 15 deadline looms for Iran to meet international requirements regarding its nuclear program. Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency agreed in February on seven measures Tehran must take, as the United States, France, Russia, Germany, China, and the United Kingdom hope to broker a final agreement with Iran on May 13 in Vienna, Austria. Behrouz Kamalvandi, Iran's atomic department spokesman, says his country has already taken six of those steps, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported Sunday. Many countries and international entities have expressed concern about Iran using its nuclear program to built atomic weaponry. Iran has said it just wants to create nuclear power plants for civilian energy.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The suspected cyberattack that struck South Korean banks and media companies this week didn't originate from a Chinese IP address, South Korean officials said Friday, contradicting their previous claim. The Korea Communications Commission, a South Korean regulator, said that after ""detailed analysis,"" the IP address that was thought to be from China was determined to be an internal IP address from one of the banks that was infected by the malicious code. It said, though, that ""the government has confirmed that the attack was from a foreign land."" An IP address is the number that identifies a network or device on the Internet. Widespread damage . The attack Wednesday damaged 32,000 computers and servers at media and financial companies, South Korea's Communications Commission said. It infected banks' and broadcasters' computer networks with a malicious program, or malware, that slowed or shut down systems, officials and the semiofficial Yonhap News Agency said. The military stepped up its cyberdefense efforts in response to the widespread outages, which hit nine companies, Yonhap reported, citing the National Police Agency. Government computer networks did not seem to be affected, Yonhap cited the National Computing and Information Agency as saying. A joint team from government, the military and private industry was responding. How the hackers got in and spread the malicious code remains under investigation, and analysts are examining the malware, a South Korean official close to the investigation said. Blaming North Korea in the past . South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. The North rejected the allegations. The outages come amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the North angrily responding to a recent U.N. Security Council vote to impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang after the country's latest nuclear test last month. Last week, North Korea invalidated its 60-year-old armistice with the South. It has threatened to attack its neighbor with nuclear weapons and has also threatened the United States. The armistice agreement, signed in 1953, ended the three-year war between North and South but left the two nations technically in a state of war. The United States has deployed B-52 bombers to conduct high-profile flyovers of its South Korean ally and announced that it will deploy new ground-based missile interceptors on its West Coast against the remote possibility that North Korea could strike the United States with long-range weapons.","Wednesday's suspected cyberattack hit 32,000 computers .

"(CNN) -- It's clear from the coverage of the nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel for the 24th secretary of defense that many of those opposing him do not know him personally, as I do. The facts speak for themselves: His record shows strong support for Israel. As a person who grew up in Israel and now as a rabbi in our home state of Nebraska for the past 25 years, I have found a great love in Chuck's heart for the Israeli people and their desire to live in peace and security. In numerous encounters, I was enthralled with the depth of his knowledge, the strength of his convictions, the integrity of his character and the honesty in his search for peace. Take the matter of recent accusations against him, which say that as president of the United Services Organization in the late 1980s, Chuck went on a crusade to close a USO post in the Israeli port city of Haifa. An organization most associated with Bob Hope, the USO is a private, nonprofit whose mission is to support American troops by providing morale, welfare and recreation-type services. Chuck's tenure there is remembered for turning around a financially troubled organization and bringing it back to fiscal health in the lead up to Operation Desert Storm. When Atlantic magazine recently conducted an investigative report, both the longtime director of the USO mission in Haifa and a former commander in chief of the Israeli Navy came to his defense. Reversing the fortunes of a near-bankrupt organization requires making tough choices, and there may have been some logic in closing that outpost, but in this case, the Haifa operation was kept open and 10 other operations were closed in the Mediterranean. In fact, it was not until 2002, near the end of Chuck's first term in the U.S. Senate, that the USO's Haifa office was closed. Ari Fleischer: Hagel is wrong on why U.S. supports Israel . Others have pointed out that as a U.S. senator, he opposed sanctions against Iran, an example frequently used to show that he was not being supportive of Israel. Iran has been on my mind for a long time. The danger is clear for the security of Israel and the entire Middle East. But I know Chuck's preference is for multilateral sanctions over unilateral sanctions, and what's wrong with that? Cuba is a prime example of decades of unilateral sanctions not working. Americans need only go to cities on or near the Canadian border such as Windsor, Niagara Falls and Vancouver to purchase the famed Cuban cigars. But when dealing with Iran, we do not have decades to wait the regime out. The danger is real. The consequences are overwhelming. Like Chuck, I would rather have the world powers behind a united effort to stop and reverse the nuclear ambitions of Iran's leadership. I use these two examples to show that accusations against him of being anti-Semitic and not being supportive of Israel are groundless. As a student of world history in general and Jewish history in particular and as one who knows and abhors anti-Semitism, I think it cheapens the lives and the memories of my people when the label is attached and used on someone who may not share the same policy views as those opposing his nomination. It is despicable and revolting when name-calling becomes more important than the substance at hand. We, all children created in God's image, need to be extremely careful in uttering words that hurt and make sure to introduce only words that heal. Indeed, a real friend of anyone, including Israel, is supposed to be frank and offer counsel, especially when there is so much at stake. Finally, American support for Israel is best when it is bipartisan, as it has been historically. Recent efforts to smear Chuck get us further away from support for Israel being a bipartisan issue, and ultimately that hurts the long-term security of the state of Israel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rabbi Aryeh Azriel.","Chuck Hagel's nomination has been criticized on issue of support for Israel .

"(CNN) -- As an American socialite and hotel heiress, Paris Hilton has built up a global brand on her sexy image -- and sometimes very few clothes. But many believe she has gone a step too far in opening a store selling luxury items in the Muslim holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Hilton's rise to worldwide fame was boosted in part by a homemade sex movie that went viral online in 2003, days before the debut of her reality TV series ""The Simple Life."" This does not sit well with many in Mecca, which attracts three million Muslim pilgrims from around the world every year. All Muslims who are able are expected to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime, and non-Muslims are not allowed to enter the city. Most Saudi women cover themselves fully with a black abaya. Hilton introduced her store on the social media site Twitter, when she wrote, ""Loving my beautiful new store that just opened at Mecca Mall in Saudi Arabia!"" accompanying the post with a picture. She later added: ""This is the 5th store in Saudi Arabia, and store number 42 in total! So proud to keep growing my brand!"" It is not the store itself that is out of place in Mecca -- the presence of Western luxury brands is nothing new in Saudi Arabia. Hilton's store sells luxury handbags and accessories and is in the new Makkah Mall, which opened in 2011 with 255 shops, many of them global chains, selling everything from jewelery to electronics, women's fashion to sportswear. It even has a branch of the lingerie chain La Senza. Also on Inside the Middle East: New wealth brings luxury shopping to Iraq . Paris Hilton has 42 stores worldwide selling handbags, accessories, shoes, fragrances, watches and T-shirts, and already has four in Saudi Arabia. However, the combination of Hilton's personal image with the holiest city in the Muslim world has riled some in the conservative kingdom. Sheikh Adnan Baharith, a conservative cleric who preaches in Mecca, said: ''It is unnecessary to have her shop here because we do not need it. ''If it was in our hands we would have closed all of her shops in Saudi.'' For others, the outrage was more about the ongoing commercialization of the heritage of Mecca than Hilton herself. Ahmed Al Omran, who writes the blogs Saudi Jeans and Riyadh Bureau, said: ""Some people were angry about it and others saw the humor in it. ""In the end, it's made a lot of people think about the bigger issue of the commercialization of Mecca where historic sites have been demolished to make way for modern malls and international brands. ""There's no particular reason to be outraged about Paris Hilton when we already have Gucci and Christian Dior. But for many it's further evidence of how the character of Mecca is being lost."" He added: ""It's the combination of the location of the store, who Paris Hilton is and what she stands for."" Others on Twitter expressed similar concerns. Muna AbuSulayman, a Saudi host on MBC wrote: ""Huge outrage on Paris Hilton shop in Mecca Mall! With or against? Or, don't care? Personally I am against the (Disneyfication) of Mecca.'' Laila Lalami, a Moroccan writer based in Los Angeles, tweeted: ''Wahhabis (the dominant branch of Islam in Saudi) at work! Historic religious sites in Medina are being destroyed, while Paris Hilton opens a new store in Mecca mall.'' A Saudi nursing student Aqila Bint Suleyman wrote: ''Paris Hilton's new store in (Mecca). Islamic Heritage being torn apart whilst Saudi makes way for atrocities like this!'' While some, like Dubai-based Saudi entrepreneur and founder of Switch restaurant Deem AlBassam, are more pragmatic. He said: ""Saudi is a fair-trade market, where many investors from around the world come to invest and trade. I think it was a smart move from the local partners in expanding to (Mecca) considering it (is) one of the prime locations and hubs in the kingdom's retail industry. ""The other four branches of the store in the country indicate acceptance from the people and the fifth store is simply catering to their demands."" CNN's calls to the Paris Hilton Shop headquarters in the United States were not returned.","American socialite opens store in Muslim holy city of Mecca .

"(CNN) -- After a campaign season that seems to have gone on for years, the day has finally arrived. On Tuesday, America will select a president of the United States, about a third of the Senate and a new House of Representatives. We invited CNN contributors to tweet their predictions.

Democratic strategist Paul Begala disagrees with Castellanos' prediction. Right after the first presidential debate in which some were underwhelmed by President Barack Obama's performance, Begala remarked, ""There is no doubt Romney had a good night. But I strongly doubt whether it was good enough."" Begala's tweet reflects his prediction of a narrow win for Obama. Castellanos and Begala saw each other's predictions and plan to duel it out with a wager. Stay tuned to see who has to shave his moustache or grow one.

Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary in the George W. Bush administration, suspects that the election won't end Tuesday night -- that seven states could be decided by one percentage point or less. And if Romney can take Pennsylvania and Ohio, it ""would be icing on the cake."" John Avlon, a contributor to ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" said Sunday that the stakes are especially high in this election. Regardless of who wins, he says, ""We cannot continue to allow extreme partisan distortions to define our policy debates and paralyze our capacity for constructive self-government."" Avlon said he thinks Democrats have an edge. Politics: Why elephants? Election riddles solved . Maria Cardona, former communications director for the Democratic National Committee, sees Obama getting the Latino vote. Conservative William Bennett, who believes that ""Romney has proven himself the man to lead America's comeback,"" predicts that victory will also go to his candidate. David Gergen, who has been an adviser to four presidents, notes that polls indicate the president got an important bump off of Hurricane Sandy. LZ Granderson, a CNN regular, makes a case for why he's rooting for Obama, saying that while the incumbent is not perfect, his concern for those less fortunate makes him worthy of a second term.

"Washington (CNN) -- The former vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff is under investigation by the Justice Department regarding material in a book by David Sanger, a correspondent for The New York Times, a source directly familiar with the situation said Thursday. The source could not confirm that the investigation involving retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright is specifically about the Stuxnet computer virus, which Sanger writes about in his recent book ""Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power."" NBC News reported Thursday, citing legal sources, that Cartwright has been told he's under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information about Stuxnet, a complex virus that infected computers in Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010. CNN has been unable to confirm specifics of NBC's report. Officials from the Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney's Office, as well as Cartwright and his lawyer have not commented. The leak about Stuxnet was one of a series of national security-related leaks last year and had details of how the United States and Israel were behind the cyberattack. The leaks appeared in the Times, Newsweek and The Associated Press stories. They prompted an FBI investigation and outraged top intelligence lawmakers. The first story involving leaked information was Sanger's June 2012 piece in the Times about the U.S. role in cyberattacks against Iran's key nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz, revelations that also appear in ""Confront and Conceal."" The book describes how a first-term President Barack Obama used ""innovative weapons and tools of American power,"" including an arsenal of cyberweapons, aimed at Iran's nuclear program, according to publisher Random House. Stuxnet was discovered in July 2010 after it infected the computers used in Iranian nuclear facilities, sabotaging machinery used in uranium enrichment and causing some of Iran's centrifuges to spin out of control. Cartwright is a former commander of U.S. Strategic Command and became vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2007. He spent four years there, retiring in 2011. According to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he now serves as an expert on defense policy, Cartwright was known at the Pentagon for his technical acumen in cybersecurity, nuclear proliferation and missile defense. CNN's Peter Bergen contributed to this report.","Source: Justice is investigating retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Only last week Kenya police sources say officers investigating the Westgate mall massacre were called to a meeting to explain why Samantha Lewthwaite, the so-called ""White Widow,"" continues to elude them. The pressure is on, and they almost caught her two years ago in a series of raids in the coastal city of Mombasa. She slipped through their fingers but left tantalizing clues to her life on the run on her lap top. It's been cat and mouse since. Lewthwaite first hit notoriety in the UK eight years ago when her husband and the father of two of her children blew himself up on a crowded London commuter Tube train, killing 26 people early on July 7, 2005. She claimed to be appalled by his suicide bombing but has since disappeared, her name resurfacing connected to the Somali al Qaeda-allied terror group Al-Shabaab. In June this year a Kenyan Cabinet briefing paper delivered to officials named Lewthwaite as a suspect in a 2011 Kenyan terror plot sanctioned by al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan targeting government buildings, U.N. offices and top politicians. But she seems to keep one step ahead of the law. When security services arrived at the upmarket Oakpark apartments in the capital Nairobi two years ago she was gone. She had fled the $1,000-a-month property in tears just a week earlier according to the building manager, who does not want to be identified by name. He remembers Lewthwaite well. She was fleeing, no notice given, breaking the terms of her tenancy. As he was squaring it with the landlord as she was trying to drive away, she let rip at him, he says. ""She opened the window and she says, 'This man I can kill you and people will forget you from today.'"" When I asked David Kimaiyo, Kenya's Inspector General of Police, about Lewthwaite's seven-month stay in the affluent middle class neighborhood, he told me: ""He was not aware"" she had been there, adding ""it's all rumors."" Oakpark's manager would disagree. Lewthwaite and the man he believed to be her husband had him doing all sorts of odd jobs, from fixing water pipes to fetching groceries, he says. They were the sorts of odd jobs he used to do for all his tenants, but the woman he now knows as the ""White Widow"" was anything but ordinary. The building manager told me she would change her phone number several times a day. ""She can give me a number in the morning at 8. At 9 if I call her she has changed to another line ... at 10 or 11 another line, at 4 [p.m.] another line."" She did other things that were odd too. Her apartment overlooked Junction mall, one of the city's more upmarket destinations for shopping. Nakumatt department store there sells everything from freezers to frozen peas, and is popular with expats and rich Kenyans. He says she would spend a lot of time there just watching people. But it's what her ""husband,"" whom he knew as Mick, did that now he says he finds chilling. He asked him to watch the mall and figure out if many Muslims used it. ""He is asking me: Can you monitor the people who are coming in this Nakumatt? Are they Muslims? Can you tell me which people are coming there in number?"" Junction mall is much like the Westgate mall that was attacked by terrorist gunmen last month, leaving 67 people dead. The gunmen spared those who could show they were Muslim. And these days no corner of Kenya is spared the speculation that Lewthwaite may have played a role in that attack. It never occurred to the building manager that Lewthwaite might be anything other than the employee of a French ""intercom"" company that she claimed to be. She had explained to the building manager that even though she was a Muslim, her mother was Christian and that's why she had given Christian names to her children. Of course now he knows it's all lies, her eldest son whom he knew as Adam was tough, he says, and ready to protect his mother. ""This boy is bad. 'I will kill you,' he said. 'I will kill you,' He was tough-talking, like a big person"". What names Lewthwaite and her family go by today is anyone's guess. At Oakpark she had signed the tenancy agreement using a fake South African passport in the name of Natalie Faye Webb, a British nurse from Essex. Police seized that passport in the raid in Mombasa that netted her computer a few months later. On the heels of the Westgate mall attack Kenyan authorities asked Interpol to help track her down, and they promptly issued a red notice demanding she be detained at any border she tries to cross. If she is still in Kenya, and that certainly seems to be the working assumption of the police here, finding a place she can hide now will not be easy. A white woman with four children in tow, whose ages are all well documented, would seem easy to spot. But when I asked the harassed-sounding police inspector-general how the search for Lewthwaite was going, he hung the phone up on me. The answer, I inferred, is not well.","British-born terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite, or ""White Widow,"" has eluded Kenyan police .

"(CNN) -- As Texas Rangers pitcher C.J. Wilson took to the mound Monday night, he wore a rope-like necklace that may be nothing more than a fashion choice, but if he believes in the maker's claims, that may give him an ""edge"" against his opponents at bat. It's not just Wilson; a surprising number of professional athletes have begun wearing the titanium-laced necklaces, including Rangers Derrick Holland, Mitch Moreland and Elvis Andrus. The ""edge"" the necklaces' manufacturer, Phiten, claims to give is not proved, but especially for athletes, there is psychological value to an item worn consistently, rituals and superstitions, one sports psychologist says. ""For athletes, there's this unpredictability in sports. They never know how they're going to play, how the other team is going to play, so when you do something that's superstitious, like wearing a trinket, it gives you a greater sense of control,"" said Gregg Steinberg, an author of ""Full Throttle"" and professor of human performance at Austin Peay State University. Some athletes' rituals have been well documented: Pitcher Turk Wendell wore a necklace made from the teeth of hunted animals. Michael Jordan famously wore his college shorts under his NBA uniforms; third baseman Wade Boggs had to eat chicken before games and wrote the Hebrew symbol ""chai,"" meaning life, in the dirt before batting. The extra sense of control from the ritual leads to calmness, and calm leads to better performance, explains Steinberg. Whether there are any tangible, special properties in the lucky charm is just beside the point for a sports psychologist. Fourteen-year-old baseball player Derek Halford of Baltimore says he got his own Phiten necklace when he was 11, after watching the pros wear them. ""Last season, I forgot to wear it to a game, and I called my mom to go get it, because I refused to play without it,"" Halford said. This season, he says, he views the necklace differently, but only slightly. ""I probably would still play, but my mind would be all messed up. I probably wouldn't play as well. I probably wouldn't be focused on the game, because I'd be thinking about not having it on."" His first necklace was the plain kind -- selling for $36 -- but now he has upgraded to the newer, larger twisted-rope ""Tornado,"" which costs $50. Halford adds this self-observation: ""I got it for the purpose of making me a better athlete, but now I use it just as a lucky charm."" Bill Burgos, an NBA strength and conditioning coordinator, says that he doesn't intervene when high-performers find value in lucky charms. ""When guys have a certain way of doing things, you don't want to mess with that."" The Japanese manufacturer says its products, which include bracelets worn by some pro golfers, do have a special technology that sets them apart. By fusing fabric with ""a novel form of technology that involves metals broken down into microscopic particles dispersed in water"" -- metals like titanium and gold -- Phiten is ""able to realize customers' potentials in a variety of extents that leads to restore normal status of customers,"" says the company's website. Claims like that -- and paid endorsements from 23 professional athletes in the United States alone -- seem to be enough to convince many athletes that it's better to be safe than sorry. Better to be mistaken than without. ""Phiten has used a pseudoscientific appeal in marketing their products. They talk about 'micro-sized titanium spheres' and other things that give the product the air of technology without any real science to back it up,"" explains professor Stuart Vyse of Connecticut College, author of ""Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition."" The Lavidge Co., which represents Phiten U.S.A., could not provide any published studies finding a medical benefit from wearing its metal-infused necklaces and bracelets. ""Baseball players and others who engage in superstitious behaviors understanding that they have no scientific support are likely to say 'I just don't want to take a chance,' "" Vyse said."" And they get an emotional benefit from doing something that makes them feel like they have greater control. Even when that feeling is an illusion.""","Texas Rangers face St. Louis Cardinals in World Series Game 6, postponed to Thursday evening .

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis and Vatican officials expressed hope that Palestinians and Israelis can forge a peace agreement ""as soon as possible"" as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the pontiff Monday, the Vatican said. The meeting with Netanyahu at the Vatican's Apostolic Palace comes months ahead of Francis' anticipated trip to the Holy Land, a biblical region that includes Israel and the Palestinian territories. Netanyahu also met with the Vatican's secretary of state, Archbishop Pietro Parolin. The discussions focused on ""the complex political and social situation in the Middle East, with particular reference to the reinstatement of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, expressing hope that a just and lasting solution respecting the rights of both parties may be reached as soon as possible,"" the Vatican said. Pope Francis calls for big changes in Roman Catholic Church . Pope Francis is expected to visit Israel on May 25-26, an official Israeli source told CNN last month. The Vatican would not confirm the exact dates of the trip. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas invited Francis to travel to the Palestinian territories during Abbas' visit to the Vatican in October. Pope Francis met with Israeli President Shimon Peres at the Vatican in April. A Vatican communique issued after that meeting said they had discussed the hope for a speedy resumption of direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians.

"(CNN) -- After days of mass demonstrations, Egypt's military finally ousted Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president, in the country's second revolution in two years. Morsy, a Western-educated Islamist aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood movement, had rejected an ultimatum delivered by the military to resolve the crisis within 48 hours, creating a stand-off with the military, the most powerful institution in the country. In a televised speech to the nation, Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, said Morsy ""did not achieve the goals of the people"" during his single year in office. Who runs Egypt now? El-Sisi said Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, would replace Morsy as interim president and Mansour was sworn in on Thursday. The road map announced by El-Sisi also includes suspending and rewriting the constitution introduced after former dictator Hosni Mubarak's ouster, and holding new parliamentary and presidential elections at a later, unspecified date. At his swearing in ceremony, Mansour said the Egyptian people had given him the authority ""to amend and correct"" the 2011 revolution. Who is Adly Mansour? The 67-year-old judge only became the head of Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court on Monday, and was named as the country's new interim president just two days later. He was appointed vice president of the court in 1992, serving during Mubarak's nearly 30-year rule. CNN's chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour said that, according to one former military official, Mansour could serve between 9 to 12 months in an interim role. PROFILE: Adly Mansour . How have the Egyptian people reacted? The news has been met with jubilation and fireworks in Tahrir Square in central Cairo, where hundreds of thousands had turned out in recent days demanding Morsy leave office. Their complaints ranged from concerns about the Muslim Brotherhood's Islamic agenda being brought to bear on the nation's laws, to frustration with his government's failure to address high unemployment, crime and living costs. But Morsy, who was elected as president with 52% of the vote last year, retains a substantial support base, which has congregated at rallies in places like Nasr City in Cairo. The pro-Morsy camp has decried the army's move as an illegitimate coup and refused to accept its validity, while Morsy himself has declared that he is still president. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman, a former Cairo bureau chief who has been covering the crisis, said one protester at a pro-Morsy rally had told him he felt demonstrators would stay there ""until Mohamed Morsy is once again president of Egypt."" Despite the euphoria in Tahrir, said Wedeman, ""There's a significant portion of the Egyptian population -- I wouldn't suggest it's a majority -- who are very upset at what has happened."" As news of the coup broke, clashes were reported throughout the country, with at least eight killed and 340 wounded. Political violence had rocked the country in the days leading up to the military takeover. How are Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood being treated? The deposed president was arrested by presidential guards at their headquarters, and is being held under house arrest and ""basically cut (off) from the world,"" Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad told CNN. ""They cut all his access, all his calls. No one is meeting him,"" he said. According to reports, the military has also begun rounding up members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the long-repressed political movement that propelled the deposed president to office. State-run newspaper Al-Ahram reported 300 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were being sought by police, and El-Haddad said the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party chief, Saad el-Katatni, and his deputy, Rashad Al-Bayoumi, had been arrested. Has anyone else been affected in the crackdown? Arabic satellite network Al Jazeera reported its Cairo studios were raided during a live broadcast and its presenter, guests and producers detained, after broadcasting a taped statement from Morsy. How is Morsy's Islamist base likely to respond? Morsy has called for dialogue and appealed to his supporters to demonstrate peacefully, but observers fear the army's actions could trigger a violent response. Wedeman said there was a danger that some members of the Muslim Brotherhood would become disenfranchised and ""challenge (Egypt's new leaders) with violence. They may take the attitude of 'we tried to play the game, our leaders were jailed, our media have been shut down ... so we're going to destroy the system,'"" he said. He felt the mood appeared more volatile than after Mubarak's ouster in 2011. ""There's not going to be that quiet after the storm this time around,"" he said. Mohammed Ayoob, Michigan State University professor emeritus of international relations, wrote an opinion piece for CNN.com warning of a potential extremist backlash to the coup. ""The major lesson that Islamists in the Middle East are likely to learn from this episode is that they will not be allowed to exercise power no matter how many compromises they make in both the domestic and foreign policy arenas."" He added: ""This is likely to push a substantial portion of mainstream Islamists into the arms of the extremists who reject democracy and ideological compromise."" Telling CNN's Anderson Cooper that the pro-Morsy protests would remain on the streets, Muslim Brotherhood spokesman El-Haddad reiterated his movement's commitment to non-violence, but hinted at the frustrations felt by his camp. ""At the end of the day, we are committed to democracy and to peaceful change of power. But if the road to democracy every time ... gets derailed ... what other option are the people left with?"" What has been the reaction internationally? U.S. President Barack Obama has expressed his country's ""deep concern"" over the toppling of a democratically elected leader and the suspension of the constitution, and said he would instruct officials to review aid contributions to Egypt as a result. But as CNN's Jake Tapper pointed out, Obama's statement was telling in that he did not use the word ""coup,"" and in that he called on the Egyptian military to restore power to ""a democratically elected civilian government"" -- but not explicitly Morsy's. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also called for a quick return to civilian rule, appealing for ""calm, non-violence, dialogue and restraint."" By contrast, Saudi Arabia and the UAE both issued statements congratulating the Egyptian military for their actions. 'Correction' or 'coup'? The military's actions have been decried as a coup by Morsy supporters but celebrated as a ""correction"" and an expression of the popular will by his opponents. The issue of definition is critical, as Amanpour pointed out, with ramifications in terms of how the international community responds to the situation. But, she said, ""if it's proven and true that they're running around issuing arrest warrants for all these people, attacking and closing down various media outlets, there's very little you can call it other than a coup. ""As one analyst said to me... no matter what it's called... it's umpired by the army... It's the army in charge no matter who they put there (in charge)."" The situation was ""a paradox,"" she added. ""Here you have the first elected government -- which obviously didn't perform as the people wanted -- now being drummed out by the military called upon by so many millions of Egyptians.""","Morsy ousted after rejecting army ultimatum to resolve the crisis within 48 hours .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu labeled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe ""Frankenstein"" and called for other countries to intervene before the country descended into bloodshed. Desmond Tutu has labelled Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe a ""Frankenstein for his people"" International military action against Mugabe's regime, however, is unlikely, said Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith. And Friday's runoff election in the country will go on ""no matter what,"" said the U.S. ambassador in Zimbabwe. Tutu -- speaking from Capetown, South Africa -- told Australian television that Mugabe has disappointed many who held him in high regard for his role in liberating the country from ""the shackles of colonialism."" ""He has, I mean, mutated into something that is quite unbelievable,"" Tutu said late Tuesday. ""He has really turned into a kind of Frankenstein for his people."" Mugabe, 84, has been Zimbabwe's only leader since it gained independence from Britain in 1980. Frankenstein is the name of the scientist in a Mary Shelley novel who creates a monster in the likeness of man. Over the years, popular culture has taken to referring to the creature itself as ""Frankenstein."" Tutu, the Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, urged international intervention to curb the violence and harassment leading up to a runoff vote in Zimbabwe. ""I just hope I mean that we don't wait until it is too late,"" he said. ""You know, Rwanda happened despite all the warnings that the international community was given. They kept holding back and today we are regretting that we did not, in fact, act expeditiously."" An ethnic cleansing campaign in Rwanda in 1994 led to the deaths of more than 800,000 people, according to the United Nations. Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has called for armed international peacekeepers to secure a new presidential election in his country. But international military action against Zimbabwe's regime is unlikely, Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told reporters. He instead urged other southern African nations to put pressure on Mugabe to step down. ""I don't think that the international community will move in the first instance or quickly or necessarily at all to military intervention in Zimbabwe,"" Smith said Tuesday. ""We've been arguing for some time and we repeat the argument that the primary responsibility here has to fall upon Zimbabwe's neighbors."" The U.N. Security Council has unanimously condemned the Zimbabwean government for the campaign of violence and intimidation, but stopped short of calling for a postponement of the runoff or for a new election. Mugabe has said Friday's vote would take place as planned. James McGee, U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe, said Mugabe's ZANU-PF party intends to force people to vote even though Mugabe will be the only candidate on the ballot. ""So they're saying 'We want an election at all costs. We want to validate Mr. Mugabe's victory here,"" McGee said Tuesday. ""There's really nothing that we can do here in the international community to stop these elections."" Zimbabwean opposition leader, Tsvangirai, won the most votes in the March 29 election but failed to gain a majority. He formally withdrew Tuesday from the runoff, citing violence against party members. Legal experts in Zimbabwe, however, have said he cannot legally withdraw from the runoff; the Electoral Commission is to meet Wednesday to discuss the matter, the state-run newspaper Harare Herald reported. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday from the Dutch Embassy in Harare, where he has been granted refuge since Sunday, he said, ""This is total war and we cannot be part of that war.  Watch Tutu's full interview » . ""This is not an election,"" he said. ""The conditions are just horrendous."" He added, ""I've been arrested, I've been brutalized -- this is not exaggeration. This is reality here."" Mugabe's government has denied responsibility for the violence in Zimbabwe, instead blaming supporters of Tsvangirai's own Movement for Democratic Change party. ""He's frightened, frightened of the people,"" Mugabe said of Tsvangirai at a rally Tuesday. "" ... Seeking refuge? What for?""","Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu calls Zimbabwe President ""Frankenstein""

"(CNN) -- The United States could have acted sooner to designate Boko Haram a foreign terrorist organization, a State Department official told Congress on Thursday, adding that ""resolving this crisis is now one of the highest priorities of the U.S. government."" Robert Jackson, the principal deputy assistant secretary for African affairs, told a Senate subcommittee that the initial debate within the State Department over a terror label ""was really about the Nigerian attitude towards designation"" for the Islamic extremist group that advocates Sharia law. ""The government of Nigeria feared that designating these individuals and the organizations would bring them more attention, more publicity and be counter productive,"" said Jackson. ""For some time we accepted that point of view."" Pressed by Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, Jackson acknowledged that ""in retrospect, we might have done it earlier. I think the important thing is that we have done it and that we've offered a reward for the top leadership of Boko Haram's location."" The group, which has claimed responsibility for kidnapping more than 200 school girls in northern Nigeria last month and threatening to sell them into slavery, was added to the terror list last November by Secretary of State John Kerry. The timing of the action has triggered a political controversy around Hillary Clinton, who preceded Kerry as America's top diplomat and is weighing a potential run for president in 2016. A formal terror designation provides greater access to a group's finances and more ability to limit its movements. Officials said Boko Haram does not have financing in the United States. Some in Congress, the Justice Department and others called for the State Department to apply a terror label to Boko Haram in 2012 following a bombing in Abujat and amid growing concerns that it had al Qaeda links. But the agency, then led by Clinton, rejected that approach. Officials cited the reasons raised by Jackson, which also included the possibility that doing so might heighten threats against U.S. and Western interests. A letter to Clinton at the time by the 24 academics, including former U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell of the Council on Foreign Relations, also said such a move would raise the group's profile and possibly link the United States to abuses by Nigerian forces cracking down on the group. Republicans are now seeking to use the Boko Haram terror case as well as the deadly September 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, to depict Clinton as complicit in what they argue is weakened foreign policy under President Barack Obama. But former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson, who served under Clinton, told reporters last week that the convoluted socio-economic dynamics of Nigeria required a more holistic and nuanced approach than the security focus of anti-terrorism efforts. ""This is a very complex situation,"" he said. Still, there was swift political reaction to Jackson's comments. Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton rapid-response group, said ""the facts are clear and hindsight doesn't change"" things. It noted the State Department under Clinton placed three Boko Haram members on a terror blacklist. The Republican National Committee also weighed in, saying Boko Haram was ""another hard choice where Hillary made the wrong decision."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","State Department official says there was debate within agency about terror designation .

"Washington (CNN) -- Five close calls involving passenger jets at big U.S. airports prompted a recommendation on Monday for new rules to prevent planes from getting dangerously close to each other when one aborts a landing. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) change its standards to ensure safe aircraft separation in cases of a ""go-around."" That's when pilots cut short a landing at the last minute and pull up to circle the airport before making another try. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman outlined four incidents in 2012 and one in 2006 when planes initiating ""go-arounds"" and got dangerously close to aircraft taking off or landing. Three occurred at Las Vegas's McCarran airport, one at New York's John F Kennedy airport and one at Charlotte-Douglass International. Airliners too close for comfort over New York . ""The NTSB is concerned that in these events, ATC (air traffic control) was not able to ensure the safe separation of aircraft."" Hersman wrote in a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. Crashes were only avoided because pilots took evasive maneuvers, she wrote. The FAA oversees air traffic operations. In each of the incidents, the flight paths would not have intersected had the plane landed successfully instead of conducting the ""go around."" Controllers under current rules are required to ensure there is enough space between aircraft during take offs and landings. But there is a gap in regulations when those paths converge during ""go arounds,"" the NTSB said. The FAA said in a statement that it takes the recommendations seriously and will respond within 90 days. Passenger plane, military helicopter come close near D.C. The FAA said its thoroughly investigated the close-call incidents and took aggressive steps to address the causes. The incidents cited by the NTSB include: . On July 30, 2012, a Spirit Airlines Airbus A319 was executing a go around at Las Vegas and came within a quarter mile horizontally, and 100 feet vertically of a Cessna Citation landing on a separate runway. The same day at JFK, an American Airlines Boeing 737 aborted landing and came within a third of a mile horizontally and 300 feet vertically a from a Pinnacle Airlines CRJ-200 regional jet. The NTSB reported the pilot of the American jet radioed ""we are turning as tightly as we can"" while the Pinnacle pilot said on another frequency ""we are trying not to hit this aircraft off our right."" On July 14, 2012, an ExpressJet Embraer 145 at Charlotte came within 1,000 feet horizontally and 400 feet vertically of an Air Wisconsin CRJ that was departing. On April 26, 2012, a Jet Blue A320 conducting a go around came within a third of a mile horizontally and 100 feet vertically of a Learjet 60 at Las Vegas. On January 27, 2006, a United Airlines A320 aborted a landing and came within 1,400 feet horizontally and 300 feet vertically of a departing American 757 at Las Vegas.","National Transportation Safety Board concerned about near misses during aborted landings .

"(CNN) -- When Ann Arbor, Michigan, advertising executive Al McWilliams finished high school in the late 1990s, he made a vow. He swore he would ""never, ever again"" commute to work by car, ""no matter what I was doing in life."" Most of his teen friends were getting their first cars and feeling free, but McWilliams didn't see it like that. For him, freedom was being able to spend three hours a day doing something other than driving to and from private school. Driving was ""oppressive,"" and his VW GTI felt like a ""ball and chain."" Flash-forward to the present. McWilliams, now 32, either walks or rides the bus to his office every day, making his way to the back of the Route 5 bus, where he'll find a window seat and maybe enjoy a nice book. ""I feel more free when I take the bus,"" McWilliams said. ""I don't have to worry about a car, where it's parked, gas or maintenance."" He's secure knowing that, just outside his door, ""a bus is going to come by every 15 minutes and and take me where I want to go."" McWilliams represents a growing segment of America that has embraced public transit from coast to coast in communities like Seattle, Dallas, Nashville and Los Angeles. And the numbers are bearing that out. Statistics released Monday from the American Public Transportation Association show that 2012 ranks as the second-highest transit ridership year since 1957. Only 2008 was higher. Trips in 2012 on U.S. subways, commuter trains, light rail, trolleys and buses beat the previous year by 1.5% -- or about 154.3 million rides. That despite damage from one of the worst East Coast storms in decades. Last fall, Superstorm Sandy shut down some of America's largest transit systems, resulting, according to the transportation association, in a loss of an estimated 74 million trips. In Boston, the storm closed subways for several hours. The annual traffic increased 2.8% despite a 25% fare increase earlier in the year. Nationwide, ridership still increased. What's going on here? Well, several things, say experts. For one, the price of gas spiked north of $4 a gallon in 2008. That year, a lot of commuters who economized by using transit got a surprise: They liked it. They liked it because they could work on their laptops or phones. They could call friends, read books, chat with other commuters. Take naps. It was all so much more enjoyable than crawling in rush-hour traffic on Washington's Beltway, Atlanta's Connector or even in Ann Arbor at the intersection of Washtenaw Avenue and Platt Road. So they kept on riding, even as gas prices dropped. Another reason: Cities that didn't have many public transportation options in the '80s and '90s have been getting on board. Places like Salt Lake City and Phoenix, which fostered rail transit during the past decade, are now seeing community benefits like lower traffic congestion and increased economic activity. The ballot box revealed another signal of support. Last year, voters approved nearly 80% of the nation's local and state transit funding initiatives, the American Public Transportation Association said, allowing their tax money to go toward public transportation systems. Some of the winners in Monday's public transit report include: . • New York City MTA subways, up 1.82% . • Los Angeles MTA heavy rail, up 3.70% . • Chicago elevated trains, up 4.32% . • Ann Arbor, Michigan, buses, up 6.6% . • Canton, Ohio, overall, up 9% . • Lewisville, Texas (northwest of Dallas), overall up by 11% . • Nashville, Tennessee, overall up 6.8% . • Phoenix light rail, up 6.7% . • Riverside, California, overall up 8% . • Seattle, overall up 12% . • Utah commuter rail up 14.74%; light rail up 14.73% . Cities that reported fewer trips included: . • Washington Metro subway, down 3.2% . • Atlanta MARTA subway/elevated rail, down 5.02% . Riders as customers . Less than 5 years old, Phoenix's light rail line gained nearly 7% in riders last year. Experts credit the increase to the train's convenient access to the city convention center, schools, shopping and nighttime entertainment. ""We look at riders as customers and try to design the experience from a customer's point of view,"" said Valley Metro's Susan Tierney. A special phone number offers riders real-time updates on arrival times. Managers are considering adding Wi-Fi to the trains. Plans call for Phoenix light rail to expand to 57 miles by 2026 at the earliest, depending on the economy. Linking up Utah . Utah's young rail system showed a nearly 15% gain on both its light rail and commuter rail lines in the Salt Lake City area. A commuter railroad linking the city with Provo opened in 2012, helping commuters avoid annoying vehicle traffic on I-15. Utah's light rail debuted in 2001 and commuter rail in 2008. This year, two more light rail lines are expected to open for business. Lawmakers are considering using public transit to battle the region's smog problem. A proposal would offer free access to light rail during January and July, Utah's worst months for smog. Generations . And something else: The shift to embrace public transit appears to have a generational component. Younger people are waiting longer to get their driver's licenses, studies show. Many of these folks are using public transit. Millennials, age 18 to 34, like McWilliams are more likely to use public transit than older Americans, according to surveys. ""Our parents moved to 'burbs where we grew up riding around in cars,"" McWilliams said. ""My generation is going the other way. It may be as simple as that.""","New stats show rides on U.S. subways, light rail, commuter rail, trolleys increased 1.5% .

On Monday, a judge appointed Dr. Paul Fisher, chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford Children's Hospital, to evaluate Jahi as an independent expert. Fisher testified Tuesday that Jahi meets the criteria for brain death. Alameda Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo previously ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until December 30, and the judge encouraged both sides to work together. Family attorney Christopher Dolan told reporters Thursday that Jahi would need to have tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes put in before she could be moved. ""The most logical people are the ones in the hospital where she's sitting who have the ability to do that. If they refuse to do that, and insist upon moving towards this deadline of pulling the plug, then we'll just continue to do what we've been doing,"" he said. In response to the family's statement, the hospital ""will allow a lawful transfer of Jahi's body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and Children's can legally do so,"" wrote hospital attorney Douglas C. Straus in a December 27 letter to Dolan. ""Children's is willing to cooperate in this regard even though Judge Grillo has confirmed that Jahi is deceased and that statutory patient transfer procedures do not apply here,"" Straus wrote. The hospital asked the family's attorney for the name of the facility that would accept Jahi, a transportation plan for her, and consent from the Alameda County coroner for the ""transfer since we are dealing with the body of a person who has been declared legally dead,"" Straus wrote. The family will also have to ""find a physician that would be willing to operate on the body,"" said hospital spokesman Sam Singer. In an earlier response to the family, Children's Hospital Chief of Pediatrics David Durand noted that the judge didn't authorize a transfer to another facility. ""Judge Grillo was very clear on Tuesday December 24. He ruled Jahi McMath to be deceased and instructed the hospital to maintain the status quo. Judge Grillo did not authorize or order any surgical procedures or transfer to another facility. ""Children's Hospital Oakland does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice. Children's Hospital Oakland continues to extend its wishes for peace and closure to Jahi McMath's family,"" he said. CNN's Dan Simon, Catherine E. Shoichet, Michael Martinez and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","NEW: Family must find a doctor who's willing to operate on body, hospital says .

"New York (CNN) -- The U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians engaged in fraud during his career as a financial adviser and skipped out on paying nearly $1.5 million to an elderly client, according to financial records. Before joining the military in late 2001, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was accused of multiple instances of securities fraud. That includes a May 2000 complaint alleging Bales bilked over $600,000 from an elderly Ohio couple's retirement fund, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, an independent securities regulator. ""We were taken advantage of,"" said Gary Liebschner, a former client of Bales. ""He took an awful lot of money from us that he turned into commissions for himself."" Liebschner said when photos first began to surface of Bales, he didn't recognize him. But when he saw a high school photo of Bales, he realized the suspect in the Afghanistan killings was his former broker. Bales served as Liebschner's financial adviser and stockbroker from mid-1998 to late 1999 and defrauded the Ohio senior citizen out of at least $637,000, according to FINRA records. ""He didn't pay any of what was owed to us,"" said Liebschner. ""[Bales'] financial problems have nothing to do with this, PERIOD,"" said John Henry Browne, Bales' attorney, in an e-mail response to a request for comment about the securities complaints. The arbitration conducted by FINRA in 2003 found Bales jointly responsible for paying Liebschner $1,490,875 in damages and legal fees, excluding interest, according to the securities regulator's records. Bales did not appear at the dispute resolution hearing, and Ohio and FINRA records indicate he never paid any of the amount for which he was found liable. Michael Patterson Inc., the now-shuttered firm that employed Bales, and the firm's founder, Michael Patterson, were also found responsible for paying the award. Both the firm and Patterson never paid any of the restitution either, according to Liebschner. Michael Patterson Inc. was barred from dealing securities in Ohio, according to the state's Commerce Department. Multiple voice messages left by CNN for Michael Patterson were not returned. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a federally mandated corporation, did award Liebschner a small amount of reparations, he said. SIPC could not disclose any settlement details. ""We were able to get a few thousand dollars from SIPC, nowhere near the arbitration award,"" said Liebschner. ""Not even close."" Liebschner, a lifelong epileptic, was admitted to Ohio State University Hospital in November 1998 for seizures and remained bedridden for six months after his liver failed. It was during that time Liebschner believes Bales swindled him. ""He took advantage of the fact that I was in the hospital, said Liebschner. ""I didn't feel I was a dummy. I have two master's degrees. But at the time I couldn't walk, talk, or swallow."" Liebschner said that by the time he returned from the hospital, mail containing the status of his individual retirement account had piled up in a cardboard box his wife, Janet, had set aside. After opening the letters, Liebschner discovered that Bales had sold off his AT&T and Lucent shares, trading them for penny stocks. His account had been reduced to $30,000 from roughly $1 million, Liebschner said. ""He traded away my AT&T shares, probably worth about $75 a share, that I had saved up since the early '60s,"" said Liebschner, a former AT&T employee. The Ohio couple was never able to locate Bales after filing their formal complaint against him, making it very difficult to take him to court. Leibschner said his attorney at the time, Earle R. Frost Jr., advised him not to press forward with a criminal case. ""We heard he was in the Bahamas and Florida, and I think he was in a couple different cities here in Ohio,"" Liebschner said. ""He seemed pretty good at the start, but he was pretty flashy, too -- a bit arrogant. He led on like he was a big dealer, and could do just about anything that you wanted him to do."" According to regulatory records, Bales moved around between several different brokerages during his five years as a securities broker, never settling in for long at any of them. Three years after the Liebschners' complaint was filed, a FINRA arbitrator found that Bales engaged in fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unauthorized trading, unsuitable investments and churning. The latter occurs when a broker engages in excessive trading of securities in a customer's account primarily to generate commissions that only benefit the broker. He was ordered to pay Liebschner $637,000 as compensatory damages plus interest and another $637,000 in punitive damages. The arbitrator also found Bales and the company responsible for paying $216,500 in attorneys' fees and a filing fee. FINRA, which was formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, is a private, nongovernmental securities regulator. The U.S. government's regulatory arm is the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under FINRA rules, the securities regulator can suspend or cancel the registration of a broker or brokerage firm if that party does not comply with an arbitration award. FINRA does not take any further action to recover awards. FINRA would not disclose whether Bales' broker license was suspended, but Bales was last registered with FINRA in December of 2000, seven months after the Liebschner dispute was filed. He never returned to trading securities, according to FINRA records. A separate complaint of unauthorized bond trading was filed against Bales by an Ohio woman on June 9, 2000, according to an Ohio Commerce Department report. In the report, Bales claims the illegal trading occurred after he left Michael Patterson Inc. ""I wouldn't have expected him to do that,"" said Liebschner when asked about the recent murder allegations. ""But he is not a good person, in my opinion.""","Robert Bales never paid any of a $1.5 million award to the Ohio couple he defrauded .

"(CNN) -- When Israel is forced to defend its citizens from Palestinian terrorism originating from Gaza, we've come to expect outrage around the world. Critics are quick to condemn Israel's military actions -- some with such heavy-handed charges as ""war crimes,"" ""atrocities"" and even ""genocide,"" while remaining silent about the terrorists who started the conflict. At anti-Israel protests around the world, violent anti-Semitism is on full display, thinly veiled as criticism of Israel. Demonstrators in Turkey have attacked Israeli embassies. In Germany, France, Italy and Spain and other European countries, the protests have led to anti-Semitic attacks on Jewish people, community centers and synagogues. We've seen violence and incitement against Jews rising in Latin America as well. It has been lost on no one that this pronounced anti-Semitism has its antecedents in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Fortunately, some responsible European leaders are standing up to the hatred and bigotry. But their words may not be enough, as Israel continues to be treated as the international community's whipping boy in the latest conflict. It is time for moral clarity on Gaza. The facts bear repeating. Hamas intentionally started this conflict. Hamas militants built miles of underground tunnels -- at least 30 tunnels in all -- using about 600,000 tons of cement and other materials that could have built homes or schools for Palestinians. Instead, it went into a sickening subterranean network of tunnels designed to carry out surprise terrorist attacks across the border in Israel. It has been said that the only real growth industries in Gaza are in rocket-building and tunnel construction. This unconscionable waste of resources has brought about the two crowning ""cultural"" achievements of Hamas: Thousands of rockets raining down on Israeli towns and cities and terrorists armed to the teeth emerging from holes in the ground, intent on kidnapping more Israeli soldiers and killing Israeli civilians. This culture of death is an essential part of Hamas' identity and ideology and has motivated the Hamas leaders for the more than eight years they have controlled Gaza. The world knows that Hamas intentionally stores its rockets in homes, mosques, hospitals and schools. No matter how careful Israel tries to be in warning civilians before attacks, no matter how much restraint it exercises, Hamas has guaranteed that civilians will be victims. Children make up nearly half the population of Gaza, and so women and children are among those dying because of Hamas's maximalist strategy against Israel. Israel did not want this war, and certainly does not want to see civilians killed. But no matter, the calumny continues to rain down on Israel. What hypocrisy this is. Has anyone condemned Hamas for the death of 160 children during the construction of the Gaza tunnels? The Institute for Palestinian Studies reports Hamas uses child labor to build its terror tunnels and prizes their nimbleness and work ethic. On the news every day there is the macabre body count of how many civilians have lost their lives in Gaza, invariably accompanied by a comparison with the cost of life for Israeli soldiers and civilians. Counts vary, but most put the numbers of Palestinian deaths around 1,800 and Israeli deaths at 65. All deaths that come about as a result of this conflict are tragic. But who is taking steps to limit casualties? Israel. Who is apologizing for the loss of life in Gaza? Israel. Hamas, on the other hand, tries at every opportunity to inflict as much pain as possible on Israel, trying to kill more Israeli civilians by firing rockets at large population centers, by sending suicide bombers across the border and sacrificing the lives of their own children. They make no apologies for their culture of death. Look out at the world, there is no shortage of horrific violence and tragic death. Death by the thousands, by the tens of thousands in Syria; human destruction in Libya, in Afghanistan, in Iraq. Muslims slaughtering Muslims. And in Iraq, Muslims are killing Christians. Why have the voices of outrage in response to the more than 170,000 dead as a result of Syria's civil war gone silent? There are no cameras out there, there are few editorials, and there are even fewer demonstrations in the streets of Paris, of Rome or London. Here is where moral myopia verges on moral blindness. It seems the world wakes up only when Jews in their own defense -- defending their men, women and children -- are forced to kill Muslims and Palestinians. That's when the world demonstrates. This is the true hypocrisy of the ""condemn Israel"" phenomenon. And there can be no doubt that the anti-Israel campaign that is unfolding around the world is a function of the anti-Semitism that we know lurks just underneath the surface in some European societies and is all-but rampant across the Middle East.","Abraham Foxman: The world is outraged when Israel is forced to defend itself from terrorism .
At global protests, he says, anti-Semitism is thinly veiled as criticism of Israel .

"(CNN) -- Last week, Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul fell to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. In a few hours, the city's security forces had dropped their weapons and uniforms and fled. Since then, the militants introduced a political charter in Mosul and marched south, seizing additional towns en route to the capital, Baghdad. In taking Mosul alone, ISIS gained as much as $425 million in cash, an unspecified quantity of gold bullion, huge amounts of light and heavy weaponry (mostly U.S.-made) and probably hundreds of new recruits from three main detention centers, all which were overrun. This Iraq-based offensive has been coming for at least two years. After the last American military personnel withdrew from Iraq on December 31, 2011, the then-Islamic State in Iraq began its gradual but determined recovery -- befitting the organization's mantra of baqiya wa tatamadad (""lasting and expanding""). The strategy was meticulously planned and carried out in clear stages. Principally, in Iraq these militants (ISIS since April 2013) have spent two years breaking senior leaders out of prison and re-establishing a professional command and control structure; expanding operational reach, including into Syria, and exploiting rising Sunni discontent with the Shiite-led government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, thereby encouraging sectarianism. It has expanded extensive underground networks in Sunni strongholds, particularly Mosul, Baghdad and Anbar province; stepped up coordinated, often near-simultaneous bombings; and debilitated Iraqi security force capacity and morale through a concerted campaign of intimidation and assassination. ISIS has substantial roots in Mosul, where it managed to remain a potent force during and after the U.S. troop ""surge."" The group has recently been raising $1 million-$2 million per month in Mosul through an intricate extortion network. This reality, plus Mosul's proximity to ISIS positions in eastern Syria, made the city a natural launching ground for this shock offensive in Iraq, which is ultimately aimed at Baghdad. But this is not all about ISIS. Many other armed Sunni actors are involved in what has become, in effect, a Sunni uprising -- groups such as the Jaysh Rijal al-Tariqa al-Naqshbandia, Jaish al-Mujahideen, Jamaat Ansar al-Islam, Al-Jaish al-Islami fil Iraq and various tribal military councils. ISIS may be the largest force involved (with about 8,000 fighters in Iraq), but it is far from sufficient to take and hold multiple urban centers. It is still totally reliant on an interdependent relationship with what remains a tacitly sympathetic and facilitating Sunni population. But this ""relationship"" is by no means stable and should not be taken for granted. The militant group has consistently failed to retain popular support, or at minimum, acceptance. Mosul residents might be praising the current stability and ISIS-subsidized bread and fuel prices, but once the public flogging, amputations and crucifixions begin, this may well change. In fact, it is not surprising that tribal elements are already preparing to force ISIS from captured areas. The militants' prospects are also dependent on the government and its supporters continuing to advance sectarianism -- something that encourages Sunni actors to accept ISIS. Unfortunately, this apparent sectarianism has been consolidated in recent days with al-Maliki's call for a ""volunteer army"" encouraging the further reconstitution of the Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, Jaish al-Mahdi and the Badr Brigades (three Shiite militias active during the U.S. occupation of Iraq, which appear to be receiving a new boost in recruitment). Further calls by Muqtada al-Sadr to form ""Peace Battalions"" and by the Shiite community in Diyala to form ""Peace Committees"" -- as well as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's call for Iraqis to take up arms against ISIS -- have increased the perception of sectarianism inside and outside Iraq. Iran's role is crucial. Already, the commander of Iran's external Quds Force, Qassem Suleimani, is in Baghdad, and Iraqi sources have reported 500 Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps personnel arriving in the capital and, allegedly, 1,500 Basij militiamen (Iranian paramilitary force) in Diyala. As such, it seems wise at this point for the United States not to get actively involved militarily in Iraq but to focus on containment and intelligence collection. The conflicts in Iraq and Syria are intricately linked -- to act on one and not the other would be a strategic misstep. Last week, the Iraqi insurgency was just that, an insurgency. Fighters carried assault rifles and drove pickups mounted with heavy machine guns, while others drove civilian cars and minivans. Anti-tank weaponry was minimal (but growing, thanks to Syria), and anti-aircraft weapons were confined to guns and a small number of aging SA-7 man-portable air-defense systems. In addition to massive quantities of small arms and ammunition, this latest offensive has seen ISIS reportedly seize dozens of U.S.-made armored Humvees and military transport vehicles, American M198 howitzers and possibly even helicopters. There have been reports that other Sunni groups have seized more than a dozen armored personnel carriers and tanks. There can be no underestimating the impact this will have upon Iraqi instability. But this is not just about Iraq. Within 12 hours of seizing Mosul, there were reports that ISIS transferred Humvees, manpower and other weaponry into eastern Syria. Meanwhile, on Thursday, a human rights group reported that Syria-based al-Nusra Front crossed with other Sunni groups into Qaim in Iraq's Anbar province and captured several Humvees. Opinion: Bush's toxic legacy in Iraq . The Iraq-Syria border is therefore increasingly immaterial -- conflict on both sides of the border has become inherently interconnected. As the only group genuinely operating on both sides of it, ISIS maintains an overarching strategy (aimed toward establishing a unitary Islamic State and the Levant), whereby operations in Syria and Iraq feed off one another. Considering recent events and its march to Baghdad, this objective might not be so inconceivable. But beware of coming to too simplistic a conclusion. ISIS' self-interested pursuit of its absolutist ideals has made it countless enemies in Syria, and it will face huge challenges to avoid a similar fate in Iraq. Nonetheless, whatever its fate, ISIS represents a formidable force with an ever growing membership. This latest offensive is arguably the most significant event in Sunni jihadism since 9/11. Having already challenged al Qaeda's ideological legitimacy, ISIS has now underlined its perceived military superiority to a receptive younger and more fanatical generation of potential recruits around the world. While al Qaeda and its affiliates are embracing a more patient locally focused strategy, ISIS manifests a determination for rapid, dramatic results. It's certainly just shown these in Iraq. But whether this will prove a more effective long-term strategy remains to be seen.","Charles Lister: ISIS gaining recruits, cash and weapons in inevitable offensive in Iraq .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Tripoli's two million residents faced increasingly dire shortages of food and water Tuesday as rebels estimated the number of people killed during the past six months to be at least 50,000. ""I cannot overstate the urgency of this moment,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""Time is of the essence."" Ban said his goal was to get U.N. personnel on the ground ""as quickly as possible."" Sixty percent of Tripoli was without water or sanitation, Ban said. The European Union said Gadhafi forces had closed water-pumping stations in Jebel Hassouna along the route from Tripoli to Sabha while fleeing the capital. The resulting disruption of the water supply in Tripoli is ""a major issue,"" an EU spokeswoman said, adding that security concerns along the road to the stations made it impossible to predict when the flow could be restored. All 31 EU countries have been asked whether they can help if the situation worsens, she said. The U.N. children's agency was procuring five million liters (1.3 million gallons) of water to ship to Tripoli. The United Nations' World Food Programme was sending 600 tons of food commodities -- wheat flour, pasta, vegetable oil and tomato paste -- for the Red Cross to distribute in Tripoli. The impact of the parched conditions was visible at the city's main zoo, where the zookeeper said that, for seven days, the animals got nothing. By Tuesday, 10 of the usual complement of 200 workers had returned to their jobs. They said rations for the big cats had been cut in half. In the sweltering heat, rail-thin lions paced their cage, forlorn hippopotamuses looked askance at the tank of fetid water in their cage. Most of the cages were empty. Concern over the unfolding humanitarian disaster came as a rebel military commander said that at least 50,000 people, civilians and combatants had been killed in the war to oust Moammar Gadhafi. The number was calculated by adding death tolls reported in battle zones and accounts from agencies such as the Red Cross, said Hisham Abu Hajer, the Tripoli Brigades coordinator. But he did not divulge the data underlying the total and CNN cannot independently verify it. The threat of more bloodshed loomed as reports of human rights violations surfaced and the leader of Libya's National Transitional Council issued an ultimatum Tuesday for tribal leaders in towns still under the control of loyalists: Surrender or face attack on Saturday, after Eid al-Fitr festivities have drawn to a close. NTC head Mustafa Abdul Jalil told reporters that the rebels were in negotiations with the loyalists and hoped to ""avoid more bloodshed and to avoid more destruction and damage,"" but would use force if the loyalists don't surrender. ""It might have to be decided militarily; I hope this will not be the case,"" he said. As fighting continued for the last bastions under Gadhafi's grip, the longtime dictator's whereabouts remained unknown to rebel authorities. A clue came from a 17-year-old who told Sky News he had seen Gadhafi on Friday at the compound in Tripoli belonging to one of Gadhafi's sons, Khamis. The teen said he had been working for the previous month as a guard for Khamis Gadhafi. The leader arrived and spoke with his son for 10 to 15 minutes, Abdu Salam Ataher-Ali said. Friday's visit by Moammar Gadhafi came as rebels were taking control of the capital and Gadhafi loyalists were preparing to flee, the teenager told a translator during an interview in a rebel compound. ""He said Gadhafi was visiting us at the same time when we run away from Khamis' compound,"" the translator said. During the visit, the leader's daughter, Aisha, arrived at the compound, where she and her father got into a convoy of vehicles and drove off, the teen told the translator. ""He said one of the high-ranking soldiers come to us and we asked him, 'Where is Gadhafi going?' and he said 'To Sabha,' "" the teen said. Sabha is a city in southwestern Libya and one of the loyalist strongholds. Khamis Gadhafi then got into an armored Toyota Land Cruiser and drove toward the town of Bani Walid, the teen said. Bani Walid is a city in the Misrata District in the north, another Gadhafi stronghold. An armored Land Cruiser was among a number of vehicles that were destroyed later by NATO bombs along the road northward. But it was not clear whether Khamis died in that attack. Tripoli residents greeted the end of Ramadan with celebratory gunfire amid news of Khamis' death Sunday night after a battle with rebel forces in northwest Libya between Tarunah and Bani Walid. A rebel commander said Khamis Gadhafi was buried in the area. The teen said he had been persuaded to join Khamis Gadhafi's group when he was told that foreign forces were attacking the country, Sky News reported. CNN has not been able to verify the Sky News report. Khamis Gadhafi's legacy includes his eponymous Khamis Brigade, also known as the 32nd Brigade, which has been accused of human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch said Monday that the brigade executed detainees a week ago in a warehouse near Tripoli. Forces led by Khamis Gadhafi also killed scores of captive civilians as they tried to retreat from Tripoli, according to Muneer Masoud Own, who survived the attack, and CNN's Arwa Damon, who saw the bodies being hauled off. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International both documented the alleged incident. The legacy also apparently includes Shywega Mullah, who told CNN she worked as a nanny for Hannibal Gadhafi, one of Moammar Gadhafi's sons. Her face and torso a grotesque, infected mass of scar tissue and infection, she said Hannibal's wife, Aline, had poured boiling water over her head as punishment for failing to beat into silence one of Aline Gadhafi's crying children. During her year of employment, the 30-year-old Ethiopian immigrant said, she had received no pay. But on Tuesday, she was being treated with antibiotics in a hospital, where she said she was feeling better. Another of Gadhafi's sons, businessman Saadi Gadhafi, has offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels who, he said, cannot ""build a new country without having us (at) the table."" He has made previous offers, though this time he appeared ready to cut loose from his father and his brother Saif al-Islam, once considered the Libyan leader's heir apparent. ""If (the rebels) agree to cooperate to save the country together, then it will be easy and fast. I promise!"" Saadi Gadhafi said in an e-mail to CNN's Nic Robertson. In a later e-mail, Saadi Gadhafi said that the NTC had asked him to travel to Tripoli to negotiate, but the rebels would not guarantee his security. Asked about the offer, NTC Deputy Prime Minister Ali Tarhouni said Saadi Gadhafi would get safe passage to Tripoli and would be well treated, but would be put on trial rather than given a chance to negotiate. Other members of Gadhafi's family fared better than Khamis apparently did: Moammar Gadhafi's wife, Safia, daughter Aisha and sons Mohamed and Hannibal crossed Monday into neighboring Algeria. Mourad Benmehidi, Algeria's ambassador to the United Nations, said his nation allowed them to enter on ""humanitarian grounds."" Unlike Libya's other neighbors, Algeria has not recognized the authority of the National Transitional Council and the authoritarian government in Algiers has much to fear with Arab revolutions so close to home. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the government of Algeria had sent a letter to the United Nations about the matter. ""We are reviewing that letter now in New York,"" she said. ""But clearly, there has to be an international community decision in response with regard to the travel ban restrictions that (Resolution) 1970 imposes."" The resolution, which was passed in February, imposes international sanctions on the Gadhafi regime for its use of force against peaceful protesters. Any nation that takes steps beyond the resolution has 48 hours to explain itself to the Security Council, she said. Referring to the Algerians' letter, she said, ""With regard to our response to it, I think it's too early to tell."" Jalil said Tuesday that the rebels would ask Algeria to extradite members of the Gadhafi family back to Libya. He also said that, once the rebels have full control of the country, courts will be set up to hear people's complaints against the Gadhafi regime. But victory remained elusive, with loyalists controlling Bani Walid in the north and Sabha in the south and Gadhaffi's hometown of Sirte, which is located on the Mediterranean between Tripoli and the opposition nerve center of Benghazi. On Tuesday, the front line of the rebel forces was about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Sirte and about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Gadhafi forces. ""All we're waiting for is the order from the NTC to move into Sirte,"" one rebel said. But he and his fellow fighters expressed the hope that negotiations would succeed in the forces laying down their weapons. In addition to expressing concern over the humanitarian situation in Tripoli, the United Nations voiced ""extreme alarm"" over reports of ""atrocious human rights violations"" in Libya, including summary executions. ""We are also deeply concerned about reports that there are still thousands of people unaccounted for who were arrested or taken prisoner by Gadhafi security forces either earlier in the conflict or before it even started,"" said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Another report, released Tuesday by Physicians for Human Rights, documents crimes in Misrata, which had been under siege from Gadhafi's forces until rebels seized control. The report cites four witnesses who said they saw Gadhafi's troops detain 107 civilians and use them as human shields to guard munitions from NATO strikes. One father told the physicians group that soldiers forced his two young children to sit on a tank, and threatened the family, saying, ""You'll stay here, and if NATO attacks us, you'll die too."" The report, which says Gadhafi shielded weapons by moving them to markets, mosques and schools, also details accounts of detention and torture. Still, signs of normalcy were visible Tuesday in Tripoli, where some shops reopened, traffic picked up and humanitarian aid was trickling in. France reopened its embassy Monday and Britain said it was preparing to do the same. CNN's Nic Robertson, Fred Pleitgen and Dan Rivers contributed to this story .","Dire shortages of food and water .

"(CNN) -- Unless you've been living under a rock, you know to apply sunscreen. There's lifesaving reason to: About 3.5 million cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year. ""The incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma -- the deadliest kind -- is going up, and wearing sunscreen is one of the best ways to prevent it,"" says Dr. Ronald Moy, a dermatologist and spokesperson for the Skin Cancer Foundation. Stick with these smart tips -- and check out our product picks -- to make sure you're as protected as you can possibly be. Select a sunscreen you love . Finding your sunscreen soul-mate is the key motivating factor for using it regularly, experts agree. ""If you think your sunscreen is pasty, thick or smelly, you have the wrong kind,"" says Dr. Jeffrey Dover, clinical associate professor of dermatology at Yale University. ""It may make you less likely to put it on, or to reapply when you do."" Happily, there are plenty of lightweight, sheer formulas, like Vichy Capital Soleil Foaming lotion SPF 50 ($29; vichyusa.com) and La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light sunscreen fluid for face SPF 60 with Cell-Ox Shield XL ($30; laroche-posay.us). Health.com: Which sunscreen is best for you? Remember, SPF 30 is the new 15 . As a general rule, SPF 15 blocks 93% of UVB rays, SPF 30 blocks 97% and SPF 50 blocks 98%. Doctors now typically recommend at least SPF 30 -- at least being the key words. If you have a family history of skin cancer or are vacationing in a tropical spot (where the sun is especially intense), go for 50 or even 70. Just keep in mind: No sunscreen provides 100% protection. So to be safe as possible, you still need to reapply every two hours and after a swim, even if you used the water-resistant kind, says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Try Neutrogena Beach Defense sunscreen spray broad-spectrum SPF 30 ($11; at mass retailers). FYI, sunscreen becomes less effective about three years after you open the container. Health.com: Is it a mole...or skin cancer? Check labels for the term broad-spectrum . It means the sunscreen provides protection against both UVA (wrinkle- and cancer-causing) and UVB (burning) rays. Problem is, that labeling rule only went into effect in December and stores still sell inventory made prior to it, notes Dr. Steven Wang, director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. So if you're shopping and there's no broad-spectrum mention, check the ingredients for zinc or avobenzone, the only two that provide top-notch UVA coverage, he says.

""Several big studies show that most people rub in only about a fourth of what's needed to reach the labeled SPF -- it's faster and easier to put on just a bit,"" notes Dover. Instead of that old advice to use a shot glass-size dose, all our experts recommend applying two coats. Squeeze a line of lotion down your arms and legs and rub in, then do it again. Ditto for spray formulas: hold the nozzle close to your skin and spray, moving slowly up and down until you see a sheen, then go back over the area. For your face, apply a pea-size drop to each cheek, your forehead and your chin, then smear in. Repeat! Health.com: Sun-proof your skin from a to z . Don't forget your nose . It's the number one sunburn-spot, dermatologists say. ""People apply sunscreen to their face, but either skip or speed over their nose -- especially if they wear glasses, because they don't want to take them off,"" Wang says. Moy adds, ""80% of the skin cancers I remove are on the nose."" Other commonly missed areas include the feet, hair part, ears and chest, as well as the backs of hands and legs. Use a sunscreen stick to spot-apply; try Sun Bum Clear Face Stick SPF 30+ ($10; trustthebum.com) or Ocean Potion Dab-On Spot Stick broad-spectrum SPF 50+ ($5; at mass retailers). Get antioxidant insurance . Since rays can still get through sunscreen, companies are now including antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and green tea to help mitigate damage. If you don't want to bother applying a serum that contains them beneath your moisturizer or sunscreen (Wang's first choice), try a souped-up SPF pick, like Supergoop Antioxidant-Infused Sunscreen Mist with Vitamin C broad-spectrum SPF 50 ($19; supergoop.com). Health.com: Are Sun Spots Permanent? Realize that sunscreen is only one part of a sun-smart plan . ""The hierarchy of sun protection should be avoidance first, then seek shade and wear a wide-brim hat and protective clothing, then use sunscreen -- but most people have that sequence backward,"" Wang points out. Consider hitting the beach or pool in the morning instead of midday (when sun is strongest), and bring an umbrella and a tightly woven long-sleeve shirt. Know that it's never too late to start safe habits . So you baked in the sun as a teen with little or no sunscreen. While regular tanning or getting several bad burns when you're young raises your risk of skin cancer, Moy says, what's critical is that you put on sunscreen these days. ""Since skin's ability to repair itself decreases with age, your risk is even greater if you burn now."" Good thing you're using it!

"(The Frisky)  -- Jenni ""J-Woww"" Farley of MTV ""Jersey Shore"" fame might wear bedazzled boy-shorts as if they were long pants, but she isn't going to take them off for ""Playboy."" She has turned down a request to pose for the mag, even though the offer was reportedly for $400,000. ""I am not going to do Playboy in the near future,"" she told Ryan Seacrest on his KIIS-FM radio show recently. ""There is a better opportunity out there, which everybody will probably see soon."" Most think this ""better opportunity"" is a possible ""Jersey Shore"" spin-off show with her bestie, Snooki. Which has us craving pickles now. I guess we will just have to rely on our imaginations if we want to see J-Woww sans clothes. In her honor, here are 12 other ladies who turned down Playboy. The Frisky: 8 celeb who were former Hooters girls . 1. Mel Gibson's ex-girlfriend and baby mama said ""never""  Oksana Grigorieva also recently turned down Hugh and crew. She supposedly had an offer on the table for $75,000 offer to pose for ""full nude"" shots and a cover. But Oksana's rep Steve Jaffe stated, ""Not now, not ever, nor for any amount of money, would our client, Oksana Grigorieva, even consider any offer to pose for 'Playboy.'"" It doesn't get much clearer than that, but maybe her reaction was due to the fact that J-Woww's offer was allegedly much higher? 2. ""Maneater"" singer won't do it even with clothes on  Canadian songstress Nelly Furtado once turned down a reported $500,000 to pose fully clothed in ""Playboy."" Repeat: with her clothes on. Nelly denied the publisher, saying, ""To do it would be a vanity thing, an egotistical thing. It's not to say I would never do it. It's very tempting."" Half a million for fully clothed shots? That's a pretty decent ego boost. The Frisky: 12 stars posing using their hands as bras . 3. Lady Gaga won't take her pants off for money (just for free)  Even though Lady Gaga spends a good amount of time not wearing pants, she turned down an offer to pose in the lad mag, even after Hugh himself Twittered his excitement about a potential shoot. ""I mean, if I was a glamour model, I would be delighted [with Playboy's offer], but for me it's all about the music... Ask me again, though, when I have a new album to plug."" Guess it is important to keep your options open. 4. Born-again Bieber mama won't go there  It's kind of messed up that people like Justin Bieber so much that they want to see his mom naked. Patricia Bieber turned down a reported $50,000 offer to pose topless in ""Playboy."" Bieber's rep said, ""While nature's beauty in any form is worthy of appreciation, Justin's mom Patricia is a born-again Christian. There is no truth that she would ever pose in ""Playboy,"" as it goes against her religion."" Did you hear that, Carrie Prejean? The Frisky: 8 celebs who were declared ""un-Christian"" 5. Maybe six is the magic number for this Spice Girl Former Spice Girl Melanie Brown has turned down ""Playboy"" five times. She said, ""They're offering me a ridiculous amount of money but I'm just not ready to do it ... I'll consider it in the future when I feel the time's right."" Maybe there could be a Spice Girl reunion spread? 6. Lohan's been there, done that ""Playboy"" has been trying to get Lindsay Lohan naked for ages, most recently increasing her offer from a rumored $700,000 to $900,000 last year. One of Lindsay's representatives said that Lindsay would ""be happy to do the cover, but no nudity... If there's nudity, then the answer's no ... She's not going down the 'New York Magazine' road again."" I suppose the naked Marilyn Monroe-inspired shoot did cause a bit of a kerfuffle for Li-Lo . The Frisky: 12 celebs who've denied getting breast implants . 7. Citigroup banker eats her sexy words  ""Too sexy"" Citigroup banker Debrahlee Lorenzana was offered a reality show and a ""Playboy"" spread. But Lorenzana said, ""I don't want to be famous, I try to stay away from that. I just want to be an example, that's all. If people in the future still remember my name, I want to be remembered as a woman who stood up for her rights."" Apparently, Lorenzana also appeared in a 2003 plastic surgery documentary saying she'd like to be stacked like ""a little Playboy Playmate."" But that's neither here nor there ... 8. Jennifer Love Hewitt is not in love with the idea  Jennifer Love Hewitt has dealt with plenty of needless controversy over her body, but had no desire to prove her critics wrong by taking it all off. Her rep confirmed that ""Playboy"" had asked the actress to pose, saying, ""There was an offer, but she declined."" So much for seeing Jennifer's body in the pages of ""Playboy."" The Frisky: 9 celebrities explain why they cheated . 9. Bad timing for the Hulk's daughter  ""Brooke Knows Best"" star Brooke Hogan turned down the magazine in 2008. Her representative said, ""Brooke just didn't feel that it was the right time... It's not out of the question for the future, but we'll have to see."" I hope she waits until Hulk Hogan isn't around to see that because it's confusing enough with his doppelganger girlfriend. 10. Melissa Joan Hart learned her ""Maxim"" lesson  Melissa Joan Hart drew some controversy after posing in her skivvies for Maxim but said that it helped her turn down ""Playboy."" ""I learned that I didn't want to do ""Playboy."" They came around and offered me a million dollars, which I had to seriously consider,"" she said. ""Initially it's like, 'Yeah, I'll take my clothes off for a million bucks, are you kidding?'... But I decided that because of the reaction I got from ""Maxim"" I wasn't comfortable -- and my brother had that cover shoved in his face for months. That made me say no."" And that's how Clarissa explained it all. The Frisky: I Googled my date and found out he was a rapist . 11. ""Playboy"" played Jessica Alba  You may have seen the Jessica Alba ""Playboy"" cover, but the actress actually refused to pose for the magazine. After she was voted one of the ""25 Sexiest Celebrities"" in 2006, ""Playboy"" asked and she turned them down, but they obtained a photo of a bikini-clad Alba from Columbia Pictures and ran it on their cover only. Alba said, ""Playboy"" has violated my personal rights and blatantly misled the public who might think I had given them permission to put me on their cover when I didn't."" Teenage boys around the country were equally upset, we're sure. 12. Daughter of Darkness respectfully declined  Last year, Kelly Osbourne received an offer from ""Playboy,"" but turned them down, saying, ""It was the second time they have asked and respectfully I declined, as I don't feel it's the right thing for me. I know if I ever decided to do something like that I'd want it to be tasteful and done very beautifully. But still I turned it down -- I wouldn't want my father or brother Jack to open up a magazine and see me naked!"" I'm sure Ozzy and her bro are both grateful for such restraint.

"(CNN) -- There are few cities in the world blessed with a more beautiful setting than Seattle. It is surrounded by rugged green wilderness; to the west the Olympic Mountains, to the east the volcanoes and glaciers of the Cascade Range, and all around the brisk waters of the Northwest. The Space Needle dominates the Seattle skyline. Over the years, Seattle has inspired a number of nicknames. It's not hard to understand why some refer to it as ""Rain City,"" but visit when the sun is shining, when lakes Union and Washington are sparkling under a blue sky and majestic Mount Rainier is visible in the distance, and you'll realize that ""Emerald City"" is the most appropriate of its monikers. Seattle started out as a logging town, grew as a stop-off point for gold prospectors at the end of the 19th century, and earned another nickname, ""Jet City"", when plane manufacturer Boeing rose to prominence in the 1950s and 60s. At the height of its powers, Boeing employed some 100,000 locals and the Jet City remained a solidly working-class town until the 80s, when local startup Microsoft started making a name for itself. As Microsoft grew into the behemoth it is today, other tech firms such as Amazon.com and Nintendo were drawn to the city, bringing with them a wave of young, educated and affluent workers. Seattle began to shake off its blue-collar roots and in recent years its cultural credentials have been boosted by the addition of the Olympic Sculpture Park and a showpiece public library, while the acclaimed Seattle Symphony, Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet have all moved into impressive new buildings in the last decade. Some resent Seattle's gentrification, bemoaning the near-gridlocked traffic and arguing that the city's most interesting neighborhoods have lost their individuality to the property developers. But if you spend some time in neighborhoods like Capitol Hill or Fremont, the self-proclaimed ""Center of the Universe,"" you'll find there's still plenty of the native free spirit in evidence. It was that free spirit that gave birth to Grunge, the post-punk guitar noise that came out of the city in the early 90s, when local bands Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Nirvana became international stars. Now Grunge is just a memory, but in popular culture it remains as much of a symbol of the city as the Space Needle, the persistent drizzle and the excellent, ubiquitous, coffee shops. Despite its rapid growth, Seattle has kept its trees and parks and many areas maintain an almost suburban feel. The city and its residents are laidback and liberal, and that famous free spirit is as at home in the great outdoors as in Seattle's boho neighborhoods. As a modern, civilized outpost among outstanding natural spectacle, the place once known as the ""Queen City of the Northwest"" still reigns supreme.","Seattle has been known as ""Jet City,"" ""Rain City,"" and ""The Emerald City""
It has a great location, surrounded by mountains, lakes and fantastic scenery .
The city boasts a symphony orchestra, and ballet and opera companies ."
"Aleppo, Syria (CNN) -- Somehow, the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who can't -- or won't -- leave this battleground city have grown accustomed to living in a state of war. But they have also shown that they do not want to live in a state of anarchy. Read more: Morsy backs Syrian calls for al-Assad to face war crimes trial . On a side street, not far from where goats graze next to a burned-out ambulance in what used to be a neighborhood park, stand the offices of what can only be described as a rebel court. The United Courts Council operates without the authority or recognition of any central government. It stands on the opposition-held side of the front lines that divide this city. Read more: Time to refer Syria crisis to ICC . This self-appointed council of judges, lawyers and clerics started working four months ago. Judging by the line of supplicants waiting in the halls, residents appear to have granted this court . some degree of popular legitimacy. In rooms marked ""Civil Court"" and ""Personal Affairs Court,"" legal workers on a recent day issued birth and death certificates, signed divorce papers and listened to lawyers plead their clients' cases in a family property dispute. Nobody flinched when blasts from artillery shells rocked nearby neighborhoods. ""We created this temporary judicial council as an emergency solution, like when a doctor removes a bullet from a patient without using anesthetic,"" said Marwan Gayed. Read more: Analysis: Study shows rise of al Qaeda affiliate in Syria . Gayed is a former appeals court judge who defected from the Syrian government and now serves as the general prosecutor for the United Courts Council. He sat in an office, signing legal documents and stamping them with the council's seal, oblivious to thunderous explosions echoing outside. ""We have a deteriorating humanitarian situation,"" he added. ""We came to work to stop people like the Free Syrian Army or others from taking advantage of the weak and to maintain law and order inside liberated areas."" The Free Syrian Army is the main rebel force fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Read more: 'Humanitarian emergency' as Syria runs low on medical care, food . Even a temporary judicial system requires some system of detention and punishment. The council has about 100 prisoners detained in a series of makeshift jail cells in a basement that resembles a dungeon. In the ""military prison,"" a court founded by rebels has incarcerated rebels accused of committing war crimes. During a visit by CNN journalists, more than a dozen men sat on mats in a cavernous room. Some of the inmates said they were there on charges of robbery and theft. Others, like a bearded fighter who called himself Abu Younus, were being investigated for leading men into a battle that resulted in the friendly fire deaths of many fellow rebels. Abu Younus made an emotional plea, declaring his innocence. ""God, you know that I am innocent,"" he bellowed, raising hands and face to the ceiling. ""Please god reveal the truth."" Then he suddenly collapsed on the ground. ""He passes out when he gets excited,"" a prison guard explained. Read more: Leaving Syria ship before it sinks? Another jailed rebel, who asked not to be named, said, ""I am a member of the Free Syrian Army and the captain of a battalion. I tortured a shabiha"" -- a pro-government militia-man -- ""and he died three days later. ""I turned myself in. And now I'm waiting for the law to take its course ... in this failure of a court."" The jailed rebels were being held in the same prison cell with several captured loyalist soldiers. Men who could have been trying to kill each other on the battlefield weeks ago slept side by side on the floor and shared prison food. Read more: Syrian government frees 2,130 prisoners in exchange for 48 Iranians . The conditions in the basement prison were grim, dark and cold. Yet at first glance, inmates there appeared to be treated better than at another makeshift rebel jail CNN visited in northern Syria last August. There, CNN saw more than 40 prisoners being held at a time in a single, over-crowded room. Some of those detainees, especially members of the shabiha militia, showed obvious signs of torture. At the United Courts Council jail in Aleppo, the prison warden led visitors to another cell, where men sat with their backs to the walls under heavy blankets. Some read books. One inmate read a newspaper. ""This section is for shabiha, informants, collaborators, spies and homosexuals,"" said the warden, who asked to be named only Abu Abdo. Abu Abdo, a former officer from Syria's foreign security service, insisted he was trying to reform rather than punish the prisoners by giving them regular lessons in Islam. In fact, one of the judges explained that he and his colleagues are following a ""Unified Arab Criminal Code"" adopted by the Arab League, which is rooted in Islamic law. ""This basically follows sharia, while taking into consideration modern Muslim life,"" said Mohammed Najib Banna. Banna, who had been a teacher in a religious school and a cleric reading sermons at a mosque, is now a judge in the council's Military Court. Read more: Rebels in northern Syria pin hopes on airbase's downfall . ""Our work now will prepare us for the day when the regime falls, because then there will be anarchy,"" Banna said. While some of the detainees in the prison are accused of committing crimes on the battlefield, others are detained for charges ranging from adultery to prostitution and ""disobeying parents."" This is especially true in the women's jail cell, where most of the inmates hid their faces under blankets during a visit by CNN. Among the detainees was a teenage girl, the daughter of a couple who were both also incarcerated in the prison. Some of the women were also accused of spying for the Syrian regime. One woman stood and repeatedly performed a salute, accompanied by a martial stamp of her foot. Asked who she was saluting, she listed the names of the father and son who have ruled Syria for 40 years: ""President Hafez al Assad, President Bashar Hafez al-Assad."" ""May God give victory to Bashar al-Assad,"" she said with a smile. ""Because they're saying lies about him. He's likeable, excellent in every way."" Then she started saluting again. Another 23-year-old woman who asked not to be named said she had been arrested 16 days previously for being a shabiha. ""I cooperated with the state while I was in university. I used to go and come back and communicate with them,"" she said. ""And I would go to demonstrations supporting the president."" One might assume the United Courts Council had been formed to create a rival judicial structure to the Syrian government, which is believed to control a quarter to a third of Aleppo. The Syrian crisis: Where's U.S. aid going? But a visit to the office of Gayed, the council's prosecutor, revealed political tension between rival rebel groups. The suavely dressed former judge had a half dozen guests seated around his desk, most of whom were lawyers hoping to set up a similar court in the opposition-held northern town of Maraa. There was also a stocky, bearded man dressed in a camouflage uniform who quickly excused himself after journalists entered the room. ""The man was here from Jabhat al-Nusra,"" Gayed explained after the man left. ""He was asking me to hand over a prisoner to his court system. I said no."" Jabhat al-Nusra, or Nusra Front, is a well-organized Islamist fighting group. The U.S. government recently black-listed the group, accusing of it being a terrorist organization. ""We black-listed the Nusra Front because of its intimate links with al Qaeda in Iraq,"" said Robert Ford, the former U.S. ambassador to Syria, in an interview with CNN in Turkey. ""Nusra has a sectarian agenda ... (it) is anti-democratic and will seek to impose its very strict interpretation of Islam on Syria,"" Ford said. But Gayed, asked about al-Nusra, called its members ""our brothers in the revolution. They bleed for it. But we differ on how to build the state."" ""We are calling for a civil democratic nation. They call for an Islamic state,"" he said. ""The U.S. and the European Union didn't help us, and that created an increase in Islamic radicalism. ... ""Up until now we can control the situation,"" Gayed warned. ""But later on, we may not be able to contain it."" Gayed argued his council's experiment in rebel justice is a more tolerant alternative to the Islamic courts that Nusra Front has reportedly been establishing in Aleppo and in other rebel controlled towns. The United Courts Council is working to expand its law-and-order model to other communities in the largely rebel-held north. It is a desperate strategy, council members admitted, aimed at preventing Syria from descending further into chaos .","The United Courts Council operates in areas controlled by rebels .

"(CNN) -- Google's 411 service will shut down for good on Friday, but that doesn't mean the end of free calls to business numbers. Launched in 2007, GOOG-411 was a free voice recognition search service for business listings drawn from the Google Local directory. You'd dial 800-GOOG-411 (or 877-GOOG-411), speak a search request (business name or category) into your phone, and Google would list results in audio. When you selected a result, Google would place the call -- which meant if the number was long-distance, the call would be free to you. According to PhoneNews, some cost-conscious callers would call GOOG-411 to place free calls to business numbers -- using it like a ""friends and family number."" I found this especially useful when calling tech support or customer service numbers -- which often, surprisingly, aren't toll-free. But, even without the Google service, there's still another way to get around charges for calls to business numbers. Microsoft's Bing suite of search tools offers a nearly identical service, called Bing 411. According to this audio demo, it works almost like placing a normal 411 call through your phone company -- only without the hefty charges most phone companies levy for this service. PhoneNews notes it takes 24 hours to update friends-and-family numbers with your phone provider, so this service is useful when you unexpectedly need to call a long-distance business number. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Voice service GOOG-411 shuts down on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- ""Can I have a Blackhawk magazine vest?"" the young man, in his mid twenties sporting a scruffy beard and cargo pants, asked. ""With four magazine pouches, or six?"" the shopkeeper responded. A six-pouch vest was sold for $27. In this market in the center of Kabul with over 50 shops, you can find anything from used U.S. army fatigues to Campbell's New England clam chowder and Uncle Ben's classic cornbread stuffing mix. Some of it is gear thrown away from the largest U.S. military base in Bagram, just a 45-minute drive north of Kabul, and some of it is stolen goods from the massive convoys supplying U.S. soldiers around the country. In recent years, the market has also been corrupted -- like many other things in Afghanistan -- and flooded with Chinese bootlegged goods. But one thing about this market has stayed the same -- nearly four years after the 43rd U.S. president left office, it's still named after him: the Bush Market. As American voters prepare to choose between Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney, Afghans fear that the silence over this war during the campaign means it has been relegated further down in U.S. foreign policy priorities. Postcard: Athenians fear what follows U.S. election . ""We had high hopes that this war, as the U.S.'s most pressing foreign policy issue, would stir a debate among the candidates,"" said Fawzia Koofi, a member of the Afghan parliament. ""But the war is no longer acceptable to most of the Americans -- and the candidates have skillfully skirted around the issue, talking about it based on U.S. realities and not realities on the ground in Afghanistan."" But for Afghanistan, a change at the White House in shaky times during this 11-year-old war would have clear consequences, just as the war's evolution since the Bush administration shows. More: Is latest Afghan attack a troubling first? Ordinary Afghans, says Gran Hewad of the Afghan Analyst Network, are watching two issues in the candidates' agendas. ""Afghans are mostly concerned with the candidates' stance on Pakistan, and their plans and promises for post-2014 (U.S. troop withdrawal),"" says Hewad. The Afghan and American governments have repeatedly cited Pakistan as the sanctuary for the Taliban leadership, from where they lead their increasingly adaptive insurgency inside Afghanistan. A public debate about how each of the candidates plans to proceed in Afghanistan after U.S. drawdown by 2014 is crucial because so much of the country's immediate fate, particularly economically, is tied to the U.S. presence. Postcard: Should U.S. raise fist to Cuba? ""What has the U.S. done for my life in the past decade that I can afford to watch the news?"" responded a Kabul taxi driver when asked whether he is aware of the U.S. election. ""I make $400 a month in my day job and drive taxi at night -- when do I have time to know who is better, Obama or the other one."" For years, the vast number of U.S. military vehicles on Kabul streets was a daily reminder of the country's dependency on America. Today, Afghan forces have largely replaced them. But every time a young Afghan loses his or her job because a Western company tied to America's presence here is packing up, the dependency is felt in a more profound way. More: Green-on-blue attacks mean no easy way out . In the past decade, Afghanistan has seen the development of a younger professional class, much thanks to the opportunities of higher education offered by newly opened affordable private universities. This professional class answers the dire lack of capacity and speaks to a much-needed generational shift that is necessary in Afghanistan. The growth of the young professional class has happened in a very predatory economic environment. The pouring in of U.S. dollars has inflated the market, creating an unprecedented culture of corruption -- as well as a new elite who believe money can get them everything. Two former commanders in the north were locked in a heated rivalry over a seat in the parliament during the 2010 election, as a commonly told story in Afghanistan goes. One of them offered to settle the issue through a peculiar challenge: ""Let's start a fire of dollar bills under two separate pots and cook a meal. Whoever's cooked first would be the winner of the seat."" The story illustrates the new money-fuelled political reality in today's Afghanistan. A campaign debate over the future of America's role in Afghanistan would make it clear whether Washington has the patience to see through the generational shift in Afghanistan, leaving it in a more sustainable state, or whether it will leave it cold in its current political quagmire. Postcard: Why India longs for U.S. election . Major campaign developments such as Mitt Romney's tax releases and the first presidential debate found slots in the Afghan evening news. ToloNews, the country's largest private channel, picked up Paul Ryan's criticism on a radio channel of Obama's policy in Afghanistan -- a manifestation of how curious the Afghan audience is about their agendas, pouncing on any hint they give. Ryan said Obama's decision to withdraw 33,000 troops out of Afghanistan had been a political one that put the lives of remaining soldiers at risk. ""We would never put politics ahead of what our commanders say is necessary to do the job and keep our soldiers as safe as possible when they're prosecuting this war,"" Ryan said. But the print press largely seems disappointed in the lack of debate on the war here. ""The developments in the Arab world and the crisis in the West's relations with Iran over the nuclear program has resulted in Afghanistan being relegated into a secondary issue for the U.S. and the West,"" read one editorial in 8-Subh, the country's largest private newspaper, last month. ""Experience has shown that forgetting Afghanistan is a strategic mistake,"" the editorial concluded. In Afghanistan, where power has been progressively centralized in president Hamid Karzai, it is more important to gauge what he might be looking for in the U.S. elections. The next U.S. president, whoever he is, will have to deal with Karzai. And regardless of which of the many scenarios materialize after Karzai's current (and final) presidential term ends, one thing is clear: he will remain a major power broker in Afghanistan. More: Leon Panetta refutes Karzai criticism . Over the past decade Karzai has undoubtedly had a much warmer relationship with the Republicans. He enjoyed great access to George Bush until the end of his term. A sign of the consistency in their relationship, Karzai and Bush talked via videoconference once a month. ""The president would have his son, Mirwais, on his lap. Laura would be sitting next to Bush. It was quite a warm relationship,"" one Karzai aide recalled. When president Obama took office, he put an end to the monthly conferences, taking a harsher stance against Karzai -- one that has clearly backfired. Karzai has increasingly felt the Democrats have tried to undermine him, particularly when he ran for his final reelection. ""The president believed they weren't trying to defeat him, but to wound him,"" a Karzai confidant said. A wounded Karzai, with his local legitimacy undermined, would be more obliging of White House orders. The messy election went to the second round. Karzai remained in office, but a very changed man in his views towards America and the democrats. GPS: Five ways to help fix Afghanistan . While Karzai might be favoring a return of the Republicans, Afghan lawmaker Koofi believes he won't enjoy as warm a relationship even if Romney wins. ""Karzai's performance in recent years -- his inability to improve governance that is seriously putting the U.S. project at risk of failure -- means he will be a liability for the Republicans to have a warm relationship with,"" said Koofi. A Republican return to the White House, Koofi says, might return the focus to the war against terrorism at a time when a much hyped ""peace process"" is not bringing results. The Republicans have maintained a much clearer definition of the Taliban, while under the Democrats the definition has been blurred during efforts to reach a negotiated settlement to the war. But others believe it's not the Republican party of four years ago that would push for continuing this war. They want out of Afghanistan as much as Obama does. No matter who wins the November vote in the U.S, one thing is clear: the Bush Market in Kabul is likely to retain its name after the Republican who began this war. ""During the time of the Russians, there was a market named after Brezhnev,"" said Haji Khan Agha, a retired army officer who owns a shop at Bush Market. ""Many years after Gorbachev had come to power, the market was still called the Brezhnev Market.""","Many in Kabul fear the Afghanistan war is no longer a U.S. priority .

"(CNN) -- Urban transport in Bolivia's administrative capital of La Paz has always been about what goes up and down. Situated in a deep canyon more than 10,000 feet above sea level, the Andean metropolis is one of the highest cities in the world. Densely populated barrios (neighborhoods) occupy the hills encompassing the bustling city center, rising a further 1,400 feet towards the satellite town of El Alto. While these lofty locations create a dramatic setting -- particularly at night when the slopes are illuminated by thousands of house and street lights -- servicing them with reliable transit services has long proven difficult. Bus journeys that are only a few miles long can often take up to an hour during busy periods as heavy traffic clogs the city's steep and narrow streets. See also: Silk Road Railways link Asia and Europe . Come the second half of 2014, however, an all-new system of mass transportation is set to reduce the burden on these chaotic roadways. The La Paz urban gondola will consist of three separate service lines stretching across a combined 10.7 kilometer (6.1 mile) area of the city. These giant structures, most commonly associated with ski-resorts or mountaintop tourist spots, will cater for a combined hourly capacity of 9,000 passengers and come in at a reported cost of $235 million dollars. With individual pods traveling at a speed of 18 kilometers per hour (11 mph), the gondola aims to offer a transit system many times faster than more traditional modes of city transportation. As it currently stands, ""one person coming in the morning from El Alto to the south area spends between one and a half and two hours to reach his destination,"" explained Javier Telleria, CEO of Doppelmayr Bolivia, the company behind the project. With the gondola, this same journey will ""take 24 minutes."" ""The capacity may be lower when compared to a metro line or a railway but these options are not suitable on these slopes,"" he added. ""They are also much cheaper and cause less disruption during the building process as they can be built in a straight line and take up a fraction of the space that a road or railway line would require."" Socio-economic benefits . These sentiments were echoed by Michael McDaniel, a designer from innovation firm Frog Design and advocate of an urban gondola for Austin, Texas, in an interview with Marketplace earlier this year. He estimated that the cost of building a gondola comes in at between $3 million and $12 million per mile, comparing favorably against $400 million per mile for subway systems and $36 million per mile for light rail systems. See also: Introducing the world's biggest ship . Cost benefits like these have been key in convincing South American cities like La Paz that urban gondolas are a viable and economical transport solution. Rio de Janeiro, Medellin and Caracas have all introduced similar systems in recent years. When these projects have been successful, they have brought with them a wide range of social and economic benefits. Medellin's Metrocable, which connects some of the city's poorest districts with its main metro line, was even recognized as a key factor in the Colombian city winning the prestigious Urban Land Institute 'Most Innovative City of the Year' award in early 2013. Marketing executive at Doppelmayr, Ekkehard Assmann, meanwhile speaks of private compliments the company received from Venezuelan officials regarding the Caracas ""Teleferico"" project and how it has ""increased economic opportunity"" as well as ""lowered crime rates"" in many poorer and previously disconnected areas where stations are located. Bridging urban islands . For Steven Dale, founder of the Canada based website, The Gondola Project, these observations speak to the wider benefits of gondolas when introduced into the right type of urban environment. ""Being able to connect people from an island, which is what these barrios often are, to the wider city where they can access economic, social and cultural opportunities, that's the real value,"" Dale said. ""You wouldn't have been able to do it in certain places without a cable car"" due to the various building and topographical challenges, he added. See also: Could drones be the new highways? Such positive social outcomes have got other cities around the world thinking about their own transport needs and the potential benefits urban gondolas can bring. Projects are reportedly in the works in the likes of Lagos in Nigeria and the city of Toulouse in France, according to The Gondola Project. Whether these ventures meet with the same success however is far from certain. The London legacy . Many skeptics point to the ""cable car"" system built in East London to connect the O2 Arena and the ExCel Exhibition Centre across the River Thames during the 2012 Olympic Games as an example of an urban gondola project gone wrong. Although used by large numbers of people during the Olympics, passenger numbers today are a fraction of what they were when the facility first opened, according to figures provided to CNN by local politicians. The surrounding area is connected to major tube and light railway transport routes but is not home to a large residential population that would have any practical need to use the structure frequently, explained London Assembly member, John Biggs. ""It's a nice bit of tourist infrastructure but it's not a serious mass transit solution in this part of London,"" Biggs said. ""It has an annual operating cost which is a six figure sum. This is massively greater than the revenue from fares income."" See also: 8 spectacular infrastructure projects . Although critical of the London project, Biggs believes the gondola concept itself can still offer a valuable urban transit option if constructed in locations where there is demand and the economic case can be justified. ""Many towns (in South America) have quite a hilly landscape and they are a good way of getting people out to the suburbs,"" he said. ""There are (also) other parts of the world like across shipping lanes where they can in fact be quite useful, but none of these things really applied to London,"" Biggs added.","An urban gondola 10.7 kilometers in length is being designed and built in the Bolivian city of La Paz .
Medellin, Rio de Janeiro and Caracas have already installed similar structures as modes of mass city transportation .
Those behind the La Paz project hope it will reduce traffic congestion and connect some of the city's poorest areas ."
"GREENVILLE, Alabama (CNN) -- Willie Thornton is on a rescue mission. One morning in March he set out to save Desmond Dunklin, a 19-year-old who should have graduated last year from Greenville High School in Greenville, Alabama. Willie Thornton, 48, is the dropout prevention coordinator at Greenville High School in rural Alabama. Thornton, 48, the school's dropout prevention coordinator, and Lt. Malcolm Owens, the school's police officer, drive the five minutes to Dunklin's house. ""I need for you to show up,"" Thornton tells a sleepy Dunklin, who clearly has just been awakened by the men's repeated knocking on his door. Dunklin hadn't been attending school regularly, despite six or seven home visits from Thornton. Thornton has been teaching for 16 years, but this is his first year running the dropout prevention program. It is his job to mentor, encourage, counsel and cajole 70 students considered at-risk for dropping out. His school in rural Butler County claims a 75 percent graduation rate, but a number of those kids don't get out within four years. The Southern Education Foundation, an education research group, says only about six in 10 students in Butler County graduate within four years. The number sounds shockingly low, but it's actually not far off the national average. A 2008 study by America's Promise Alliance, a group founded by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, concluded that only 52 percent of students in the nation's 50 largest school systems graduate in four years. About 57 percent of Hispanic and 53 percent of African-American students graduate with a regular diploma in four years, according to the study, which puts the national graduation rate at 70 percent. ""Finishing high school is absolutely basic to being a success at any place in our society. We can't afford this,"" Powell said. ""If we lose these youngsters from our educational system, it doesn't mean they're all going to jail,"" Powell said. ""It just means they're not going to have the same earning potential as they would if they finished school. And ultimately that will affect them, and it will affect the nation."" ""I need to finish school,"" Dunklin says after a meeting with Thornton and his mother. ""My mama wants me to graduate, tells me I can't get a job if I don't graduate."" She's right. Even people with diplomas struggle to find work in Butler County. ""Our stores, Wal-Mart, eatery places are really demanding our students have high school diplomas, and we respect that,"" Thornton said. ""We really respect that because we want them to be completers."" In March, Thornton and hundreds of other educators, business leaders and grassroots activists gathered to brainstorm ways to solve the dropout problem. The meeting was funded in part by America's Promise Alliance, which is chaired by Powell's wife, Alma Powell. One of the charity's goals is to hold more than 100 of these dropout prevention summits across the country and raise alarm bells and create an army of foot soldiers like Thornton to crush the problem General Powell calls a ""catastrophe.""  Alma Powell: Every 26 seconds a child drops out of school » . ""It's a ground game,"" he said. ""There's no Hail Mary pass. This is going to be a yard-at-a-time as we go after this problem."" Alma Powell was the featured speaker at the dropout prevention summit Thornton attended. ""You cannot afford to let one go,"" she said. ""You cannot give up."" Thornton is someone who doesn't give up. In late May, Dunklin, donned the green cap and gown of Greenville High School, walked across the stage and received a folder and a handshake from principal Charles Farmer. Dunklin didn't earn a diploma; he received a certificate indicating he finished coursework in an independent study program. Alabama still considers him a dropout; he must complete more classes and tests to receive an actual diploma. It's a start, Thornton says. ""The benefit is basically for a student to say that 'I can' and 'I've raised my self-esteem enough,' because prior to that most of them in their hearts have already quit,"" Thornton said. ""What we do here [in the dropout prevention program] is try to gain some sort of success story that they own. And we try to build story by story. That gains a lot of energy and hope,"" he said. ""When you lose hope, you lose everything."" Dunklin insists he is done with school, but Thornton still hasn't given up. ""I think once he starts seeing what he needs. He'll come back.""","Willie Thornton, 48, runs a dropout prevention program in rural Alabama .

"(CNN) -- Hello Kitty fans might be the world's most spoiled travelers as the tourism industry seems determined to build a complete service chain out of that five-apple-tall bobtail cat. Taiwan's Eva Air flies a fleet of five Hello Kitty airplanes. Dubai houses a posh Hello Kitty spa. Anji, a county some 220 kilometers southwest of Shanghai, is building a $200 million Hello Kitty theme park (scheduled to open in 2014). And in Beijing, a Hello Kitty-themed restaurant is creating a lot of buzz. 'Couples come here to propose' Located in an upmarket shopping mall in Sanlitun, Hello Kitty Dreams opened its doors to much fanfare in December last year. According to the restaurant's staff, the Sanrio-licensed business is the first Hello Kitty-themed restaurant in Asia. ""When we first opened you had to book days in advance,"" says restaurant manager Ted Chen. ""We were packed from when we opened at 11 a.m. everyday."" 7 places to find gratitude and serenity . Couples make up a large part of the restaurant's clientele. ""The most exciting thing is when couples come here to propose,"" says Chen. ""Men think that this will be a memorable place for the proposal, and so far all the women have said yes."" Singer and actress Sarah Wang is the CEO of the restaurant. Wang, only 25, said in an earlier interview that Hello Kitty Dreams is targeting female customers ages 15 to 35. Cuteness overcharge . The restaurant seats approximately 70 people and is bursting with Hello Kitty paraphernalia. There is a Hello Kitty sink and mirror, pink cat-shaped dining booths, and toys are arranged on every surface with a huge, multi-tiered pyramid of stuffed animals at the restaurant's entrance. Waiter Wang Bing has been working at the restaurant since its grand opening. ""I had other options for work, but I chose this job because I find Hello Kitty really interesting,"" he says. ""My friends don't think it's weird that I'm a guy and work here. They know it's just my job."" Submit your own travel photos to CNN . One of the diners at the restaurant is Cao Ning, a 36-year-old male international trade manager. ""I take my female colleagues here for lunch sometimes because I know they grew up with Hello Kitty and still enjoy it,"" he says. It looks like he's right: His three female fellow diners, in their 20s, collapse into fits of child-like giggles, admitting they still buy Hello Kitty souvenirs, such as mobile phone cases and cosmetic bags. The food . The menu at the Hello Kitty restaurant is an eclectic mix of both Asian and Western fare, featuring roasted meats, soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, fried rice and curries. One waiter recommends the cheese baked chicken chop with sides of pasta, French fries, and vegetables molded in the shape of Kitty's face. But it's a disappointment -- the chicken is gray and stringy, the cheese solidified, and tepid spaghetti sauce tastes like it's straight from a can. Eat like a local: Share your picks . Secured with cute Hello Kitty toothpicks, the mini burgers aren't much better, with stale buns and a selection of four bland fillings -- beef, chicken, fish, and tomato and mozzarella. The Hello Kitty Homemade Ice Cream, on the other hand, provides a tasty end to an otherwise terrible meal. A concoction of fluorescent fruit loops and layers of whipped cream, the ice cream is creamy, refreshing, and actually tastes homemade. The pink-overload restaurant is extremely popular with families, with plenty of toys for sale and an arts and crafts section full of kids. When 6-year-old girl Jiang Yichen is asked if she has been excited to come, her mother sheepishly admits that it was her idea to bring the family for lunch as she is quite the Hello Kitty fan herself.

"(CNN) -- When an epidemic occurs, getting even the most basic necessities to those in need becomes an exercise in logistics. The countries hit hardest by the Ebola epidemic -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- are dealing with human suffering on an unimaginable level. We have heard the stories of quarantines, medical supply shortages and dealing with the removal of the deceased. But what about the basics? How are people in affected areas that have been isolated from the world getting necessities such as food? The United Nations World Food Programme is the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger in the world today, and it is dealing with that very issue. The objective is to ""prevent a health crisis from becoming a food crisis,"" according to the agency. Woman saves three relatives from Ebola . According to Bettina Luescher, the organization's chief spokeswoman for North America, the WFP has provided food and assistance to more than 430,000 people affected by the Ebola crisis, feeding people for six months starting eight days after the crisis was declared in Guinea. Food distribution is ongoing in all three countries, with more food on the way. The WFP buys food from the region, for example, 7,000 metric tons of rice being transported from Benin. Luescher said rice, lentils, cooking oil and rations are being distributed, food for hospital patients is cooked by partner organizations, and quarantined populations get the food and take it home to prepare. On the ground, aid workers explain how people should line up for food. They wear protective suits and use megaphones to avoid contact, out of basic safety precautions. ""On the food front, there is tension and nervousness but not panic,"" said Martin Penner, a WFP public information officer and one of the agency's members in Monrovia, Liberia. ""People are happy to see the food. Ebola is affecting the economy. ... People are finding it hard to get the food they need."" Penner says officials will know more in the coming weeks about yield as they enter harvest season for the two main crops, rice and maize. Currently, he says, food can be found in the local markets, but often, people can't afford to buy it. The price of cassava (a root vegetable that is a major staple food in many countries) increased by 150% in the first weeks of August, according to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. ""These are areas where some families spend 75% of their income on food on a regular basis,"" Penner said. The organization also says labor shortages will impact the cropping season, despite favorable rain conditions this year. ""With the main harvest now at risk and trade and movements of goods severely restricted, food insecurity is poised to intensify in the weeks and months to come. The situation will have long-lasting impacts on farmers' livelihoods and rural economies,"" Bukar Tijani, FAO regional representative for Africa, said in a statement. Battling Ebola: Two doctors for a county of 85,000 people . As the U.N.'s logistics experts, ""we do more than food.

The World Food Programme is 100% voluntarily funded by governments, companies and private donors. The World Health Organization says more than 3,000 people have died from the virus since March. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that by the end of January, there could be 1.4 million Ebola cases. For ways to help, go to CNN Impact Your World.

"(CNN) -- It appears that the police now have a device that can read license plates and check if a car is unregistered, uninsured or stolen. We already know that the National Security Agency can dip into your Facebook page and Google searches. And it seems that almost every store we go into these days wants your home phone number and ZIP code as part of any transaction. So when Edward Snowden -- now cooling his heels in Russia -- revealed the extent to which the NSA is spying on Americans, collecting data on phone calls we make, it's not as if we should have been surprised. We live in a world that George Orwell predicted in ""1984."" And that realization has caused sales of the 1949, dystopian novel to spike dramatically upward recently -- a 9,000% increase at one point on Amazon.com. Comparisons between Orwell's novel about a tightly controlled totalitarian future ruled by the ubiquitous Big Brother and today are, in fact, quite apt. Here are a few of the most obvious ones. Telescreens -- in the novel, nearly all public and private places have large TV screens that broadcast government propaganda, news and approved entertainment. But they are also two-way monitors that spy on citizens' private lives. Today websites like Facebook track our likes and dislikes, and governments and private individuals hack into our computers and find out what they want to know. Then there are the ever-present surveillance cameras that spy on the average person as they go about their daily routine. The endless war -- In Orwell's book, there's a global war that has been going on seemingly forever, and as the book's hero, Winston Smith, realizes, the enemy keeps changing. One week we're at war with Eastasia and buddies with Eurasia. The next week, it's just the opposite. There seems little to distinguish the two adversaries, and they are used primarily to keep the populace of Oceania, where Smith lives, in a constant state of fear, thereby making dissent unthinkable -- or punishable. Today we have the so-called war on terror, with no end in sight, a generalized societal fear, suspension of certain civil liberties, and an ill-defined enemy who could be anywhere, and anything. Doublethink -- Orwell's novel defines this as the act of accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct. It was exemplified by some of the key slogans used by the repressive government in the book: War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength. It has also been particularly useful to the activists who have been hard at work introducing legislation regulating abortion clinics. The claim is that these laws are only to protect women's health, but by forcing clinics to close because of stringent regulations, they are effectively shutting women off not only from abortion, but other health services. Newspeak -- the fictional, stripped down English language, used to limit free thought. OMG, RU serious? That's so FUBAR. LMAO. Memory hole -- this is the machine used in the book to alter or disappear incriminating or embarrassing documents. Paper shredders had been invented, but were hardly used when Orwell wrote his book, and the concept of wiping out a hard drive was years in the future. But the memory hole foretold both technologies. Anti-Sex League -- this was an organization set up to take the pleasure out of sex, and to make sure that it was a mechanical function used for procreation only. Organizations that promote abstinence-only sex education, or want to ban artificial birth control, are the modern versions of this. So what's it all mean? In 1984, Winston Smith, after an intense round of ""behavior modification"" -- read: torture -- learns to love Big Brother, and the harsh world he was born into. Jump forward to today, and it seems we've willingly given up all sorts of freedoms, and much of our right to privacy. Fears of terrorism have a lot to do with this, but dizzying advances in technology, and the ubiquity of social media, play a big part. There are those who say that if you don't have anything to hide, you have nothing to be afraid of. But the fact is, when a government agency can monitor everyone's phone calls, we have all become suspects. This is one of the most frightening aspects of our modern society. And even more frightening is the fact that we have gone so far down the road, there is probably no turning back. Unless you spend your life in a wilderness cabin, totally off the grid, there is simply no way the government won't have information about you stored away somewhere. What this means, unfortunately, is that we are all Winston Smith. And Big Brother is the modern surveillance state. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lewis Beale.","Lewis Beale: We live in age where authorities, companies collect information about us .

"(CNN) -- A marine science instructor's late-afternoon snorkel off the Southern California coast last Sunday was first met with shock and soon excitement when she discovered a gigantic oarfish, a deep-sea creature that remains little known to the science world and people outside. Jasmine Santana was about 15 feet underwater when she found the 18-foot-long, silvery fish with reddish fins and eyes the size of a half-dollar staring at her from the sandy bottom. Realizing it was dead, she snatched the fish's tail, and using buoyancy and low tides, powered her way back on shore. ""I was first a little scared,"" said the still-thrilled Santana, who has been working for Catalina Island Marine Institute since January. ""But when I realized it was an oarfish, I knew it was harmless."" Giant eyeball washes up on beach . After a 15-minute swim dragging the 400-pound carcass, she needed help from 14 others to lift the fish out of the water at Toyon Bay, California. ""I was really amazed. It was like seeing something in a dream,"" said Mark Waddington, the senior captain of CIMI's sailing school vessel the ""Tole Mour"" who gave Santana a hand. ""It's the first time I ever witnessed an oarfish this big."" Discovery makes a splash: The rarest whale . ""Oarfish are found in all temperate to tropical waters, but are rarely seen, dead or alive,"" CIMI, a non-profit marine science education group, said in a release. ""It is believed that oarfish dive over 3,000 feet deep, which leaves them largely unstudied, and little is known about their behavior or population."" Waddington, who has been with CIMI since 1994, said it remains unclear why the oarfish was found in shallow water this time, but it appeared to have died naturally. Waddington said while the oarfish's carcass is still being preserved in ice, CIMI has been sending some of its tissues and other samples to marine scientists, including Dr. Milton Love, a fish expert from University of California at Santa Barbara, to study its DNA and diet habits. Waddington said CIMI will likely to keep the fish's skeleton for educational purposes. Its program attracts more than 30,000 school-age children each year.

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- Diagnosed last year with diabetes, the Rev. Dan Henley point-blank refused the medicine his physician initially suggested to regulate his out-of-whack blood sugar. ""When I got the diagnosis, I said 'I don't receive that.' My doctor said, 'I don't care if you receive or not, you've got diabetes. ... I'll give you 90 days to control it on your own,"" recounts Henley, 50, pastor of Journey Christian Church in Memphis, Tennessee. The city is home to more obese people than any other American city, according to the Gallup Well-Being Index. At the start of that 90-day countdown, Henley, his two daughters and, marginally, his wife devised their own ""biggest loser"" contest. They nixed a whole slew of comparatively high-calorie, low-nutrient favorite foods from their grocery list, ramped up their exercise -- and started talking, more candidly than ever, about how overconsumption of certain fare causes illness, injury and premature death. ""I used to have this slogan: 'I'm 280 pounds of cornbread-, collard green-eating man,'"" says the 6-foot-2 Henley. ""And the bigger I got, the more I laughed it off. Then, I got this wake-up call."" Now 27 pounds lighter than he was a year ago -- and with his blood sugar levels now normal -- Henley also is founder and lead facilitator of Church Developers Network, one in an arsenal of organizations immersed in a community-wide campaign to move Memphis out of that notorious No. 1 slot. More to the point, the organized Tennesseans say they aim to be exemplars of health and fitness in a nation where obesity is so pervasive that many a municipality finds itself only fractionally behind Memphis on the obesity rankings. Girl loses 65 pounds in fight against childhood obesity . That 80 pastors of Memphis megachurches and modest congregations alike attended the network's last monthly meeting is a marker of progress in what is -- by consensus of a complement of doctors, dietitians, public health experts, politicians and grass-roots organizers -- a tough but winnable fight against fat in Tennessee. It's true that a special ambulance designed to ferry up to 1,800 pounds of human flesh broke down within months of hitting the road earlier this year in Memphis. But it's also true that the city and surrounding Shelby County -- 650,000 of the county's 935,000 residents are Memphians -- are forging ahead in a fitness effort that has yielded a record number of bike paths and farmers' markets. The ""greenline"" is hundreds of miles of multiuse trails for runners, bikers, walkers, strollers and such being developed on old Union Pacific Railway easements. There are ""shared areas of fitness,"" or SAFE zones, and a push for more sidewalks in a car-dependent region not known for being pedestrian-friendly. ""In a city and region where deep-frying is an art form and barbecuing pork is almost a religious experience, we have made some notable steps in promoting healthy living and lifestyles,"" says Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr., one of several elected officials who have backed what he terms an ""every nook and cranny"" approach to fighting fat. More than a third of residents in Memphis are obese, which the federal Centers for Disease Control defines as having a body mass index of 30 or higher. That translates, as one example, into a 5-foot-9-inch adult who weighs 203 or more pounds. People age 19 and younger with a BMI higher than 95% or more of their peers are considered obese. Memphis' protracted work against that scourge appears to be paying off. After exceeding the statewide obesity rate for all but four years since 1997, Shelby County's tally of overweight adults dropped below the statewide rate in 2011, according to the Institute for Obesity & Metabolism at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. That year, 61.5% of adults countywide and 66.5% of adults statewide were obese, according to Joan Randall, the institute's administrative director and executive director of the Tennessee Obesity Task Force. The institute does not calculate city-by-city rates. Video: Corner stores help clean up obesity in Philadelphia . Vanderbilt demographers caution that two years of data are needed to affirm that what's going on in Shelby County is a bona fide trend. If it is, the change results from clarifying what's at stake, says Renee Frazier, chief executive officer of the decade-old Healthy Memphis Common Table, one of the nation's 50 regional health improvement collaboratives. Such groups convene physicians, employers, hospitals, insurers and others with the goal of optimizing community health. Healthy Memphis is the sole such collaborative in the Mid-South. ""We've certainly captured the attention of policy-makers on this issue,"" Frazier says. But policy-makers alone won't be the deciding factor in areas such as Memphis and Shelby County. There, African-Americans comprise 52.3% of residents, whites 43.6%, Latinos 5.8%, Asians 2.4% and those from other races make up less than 1%. A fifth of the population -- across lines of race, though the poor disproportionately are black and brown -- lives at or below the federal poverty level. ""There is such a correlation between poverty and obesity,"" says Vanderbilt's Randall. ""People who are poor try to stretch their budget by buying cheaper food, processed food. They also live in pockets of metropolitan or rural areas where they don't necessarily have access to healthy food. ... There's also a correlation between physical activity and income level."" With sufficient education on topics including health and nutrition also lacking, especially among the poor, says Healthy Memphis' Frazier, battling the bulge requires help from many sectors. A food truck vendor at an 800-person 2012 holiday party that Healthy Memphis helped arrange on behalf of Leadership Memphis ended up modifying his recipes after Healthy Memphis' dietitians revealed the caloric and nutritional values of what he was serving. Your brain on food: Obesity, fasting and addiction . ""We're trying to establish a practice,"" says Connie Binkowitz, Healthy Memphis' manager of equity and neighborhood transformation. ""It's to jar people enough for them to begin to think, 'Oh, I didn't even know that' and, from there, to make adjustments."" In addition to those vendors, Frazier and Binkowitz cite the activities of such grass-roots players as retired corporate cost-accountant Adonna Collins, 77, a full-time volunteer who donates time to, among others, Healthy Memphis. For a nonrelated charity fundraiser this Christmas, Collins is replacing the refined sugar and some of the water in her tried-and-true recipe for strawberry cake with frozen strawberries sweetened artificially and selling that version. She once enlisted fellow shoppers' help in a successful yearlong bid to get the Kroger store where she has been shopping since 1961 to re-stock its shelves with fruit canned in natural juices instead of high-fructose corn syrup. She has dropped 40 pounds from a 5-foot-3-inch frame that carried 238.6 pounds at its peak. Her goal? ""Skinny,"" she says, then guffaws. ""Or, really, 130 pounds, which, on me, really isn't skinny. ... Mainly, I'm determined to feel good -- and even now, I tend to feel good -- and to share what I've learned about the glycemic index and so on."" Broadly speaking, that's an apt communal approach, says the Rev. Dr. Scott Morris, the physician-founder of Church Health Center Wellness, which operates pay-what-you-reasonably-can medical clinics for the uninsured and working poor and similarly priced memberships to its two-story, state-of-the-art gym, 10 minutes' drive from downtown Memphis. Every member gets a monthly consultation with a trainer and nutritionist at Church Health, where blood pressure gauges are on the gym floor. Center staffers run the tests and keep files of members' fitness trajectories. Health care costs to bulge along with U.S. waistlines . ""We expect the people to work this program,"" says Morris, a family practitioner and pastor of Memphis' St. John's United Methodist Church. ""This is not a place to come and get on the treadmill with your headphones on. There are probably 10 people here at this very moment who weigh 300 pounds. ... We also probably have more success stories than I can count."" Church Health has a mind-body-spirit ethos, says Morris, the doctor who diagnosed Henley's diabetes. It considers the everyday financial, social and cultural concerns that can and sometimes do factor into obesity. Collectively, the Henley clan has dropped 97 pounds thus far. (Henley's youngest daughter, a college freshman, leads the pack, shedding 50 pounds. At 5 feet 8 inches tall, she used to weigh 230 pounds.) ""The data shows that Memphis is one of the most obese cities in the nation. When I look around, I see that. I saw it on myself,"" Henley says. ""Even now, I'm still overweight and I'm still working at this. ... We saw what could happen within our own family, then we took it to our church, to other churches. The Bible says 'People perish for lack of knowledge.' Sometimes we're just ignorant to things. ... That ignorance is part of what we're trying to change.""

"(CNN) -- Italy's World Cup title defense came to an embarrassing end with a dramatic 3-2 defeat by European footballing minnows Slovakia on Thursday. The four-time champions followed 2006 runners-up France in making a first-round exit despite a frantic finale in which they had a goal disallowed. It is the first time that both finalists from the previous tournament have departed at such an early stage of soccer's biggest event, and only the fourth occasion that the titleholders crashed out at the opening hurdle. France were the last champions to exit in the first round in 2002, following Brazil in 1966 and Italy in 1950 -- having won the 1938 event before World War Two broke out. Troubled French team keeps low profile on return home . Slovakia progressed into the last 16 along with Paraguay, who topped Group F following a 0-0 draw with New Zealand. The Kiwis were knocked out of the tournament despite finishing unbeaten with three draws -- a sharp contrast to their only other finals appearance in 1982 which ended with three defeats. Slovakia 3-2 Italy . Striker Robert Vittek scored two goals to help put World Cup debutants Slovakia into the second round with a famous victory in Johannesburg. The striker put his side ahead in the 25th minute with a smart finish after Italy's Daniel De Rossi gave the ball away to Marek Hamsik, who plays for Serie A club Napoli. He made it 2-0 with 17 minutes to play after again being set up by Hamsik, but Italy kept their hopes alive when Antonio Di Natale bundled in an 81st-minute goal after a shot by substitute Fabio Quagliarella was only parried. Quagliarella thought he had equalized with five minutes to play, but his effort was ruled offside in a tight decision. Zdenko Strba had suffered a gaping wound in his knee just before halftime after a challenge by Gennaro Gattuso, but soldiered on until just before the end for the Slovaks. His 86th-replacement Kamil Kopunek scored with his first touch of the ball when he coolly lifted the ball over onrushing goalkeeper Federico Marchetti, who was again deputizing for injured first-choice Gianluigi Buffon. Quagliarella, who had a shot cleared off the line by Martin Skrtel in the 66th minute, finally got his reward in time added on with a sublime chip over goalkeeper Jan Mucha. But it was too late for Italy, whose coach Marcello Lippi suffered an ignominious defeat after the highs of 2006 when he led his side to victory in a penalty shootout in the final against France. ""I take full responsibility. There are no excuses because when a team comes to something as important as tonight's game with terror in their legs, their heads and their hearts, and they don't manage to express themselves, it means that the coach hasn't prepared them in the right way from a psychological, technical and physical perspective,"" Lippi said, reported AFP. Paraguay 0-0 New Zealand . Paraguay made up for a first-round exit four years ago with a comfortable draw against New Zealand in Polokwane. The South Americans knew a point would be enough to progress following an opening 1-1 draw with Italy and a 2-0 victory over Slovakia. The Kiwis needed to secure their first ever victory at the World Cup, but struggled to create clear-cut chances in a match of few opportunities. Paraguay coach revamped Gerardo Martino his forward line-up with Lucas Barrios replaced by Oscar Cardozo, but his players found New Zealand's stubborn three-man defense as difficult to break down as the Italians and Slovaks had previously. Paraguay will play the runners-up in Group E on Tuesday, while Slovakia will play that pool's winners the day before.","Italy knocked out of the World Cup after 3-2 defeat by Slovakia in final Group F match .

"(CNN) -- Dropping to his knees before the 10 cardinals of the Inquisition, dressed in the white shirt of penitence, Galileo Galilei was forced to retract his ""heretic"" theory that the Earth moved around the Sun. Threatened with torture and interrogated for 18 days, the scientist, who was imprisoned in the 17th century, promised to never again teach the theory and spent the rest of his life under house arrest in his small farmhouse outside of Florence. Galileo's fate was very different from that of other scientists at the time of the Inquisition. Some were executed for threatening the church's teachings. Italian astronomer Giordano Bruno, an Italian philosopher who argued that the universe was infinite, was burned at the stake. Now in 2013, as Pope Francis settles into his new role as leader of the Catholic Church, the Vatican's head of science is urging a re-think of the ""mischaracterization"" of the relationship between the church and science. The Vatican would like the world to see how much this relationship has changed. With the new pope being himself a trained scientist -- Francis graduated as a chemical technician before moving on to study philosophy, psychology and theology -- the timing could be right for a new era of cooperation between the Vatican and science, building on the work of the STOQ Project -- Science, Theology and the Ontological Quest -- which was created by Pope John Paul II in 2003. Since his election as pontiff, Vatican-watchers have been searching for signals about the direction in which Francis will take the church. Even in his inaugural speech, he referenced the importance of environmental stewardship and an appreciation of the natural world: . ""Let us be ""protectors"" of creation, protectors of God's plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another and of the environment."" According to Oxford University theologian Dr. William Carroll, Pope Francis' remarks suggest he may be planning to use his papacy to refocus the world's attention on tackling global warming and other environmental issues. Pope to Vatican: 'Act decisively' on sex abuse cases . Embracing science . Monsignor Tomasz Trafny, the Director of the Vatican's Science and Faith Foundation, which was created last year, thinks that the new pope will continue the progress already made in building ties with the scientific community. He says the Vatican today has a very positive relationship with science. ""There was a time when theologians thought they understood everything, but we learned the lesson from history"", he told CNN. Acknowledging that the Galileo era was a dark period for the church, Trafny says that the modern-day Vatican is much more careful not to tread on the toes of science. ""If you look at what is going on today you will see that theologians are very careful about what they are thinking or speaking about related to scientific issues."" Trafny will co-host a conference focusing on adult stem cell therapies with the pharmaceutical company NeoStem at the Vatican on April 11, a project which the Vatican has partly funded. This unusual marriage of church and biotech is a targeted public affairs initiative. The Vatican aims to use the partnership to show people there is an alternative to embryonic stem cell research - which it vehemently opposes - that doesn't involve the destruction of human embryos. ""We want to tell people that they can easily feel like good Catholics without any embarrassing situations or difficulties embracing science."" Taboos remain . But even some within the Vatican's own scientific community have concerns about the the church's firm stance on other matters. As well as embryonic stem cell research, the church, for instance, still rejects contraception, which is seen to interfere with God's will. Dr. Werner Arber, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and a Nobel Prize-winning genetic scientist, says in some areas the Vatican's approach remains problematic. He works as an adviser to the Vatican on matters of scientific development and regularly provides recommendations on areas of overlap between science and faith. Speaking to CNN, Arber said that rather than dealing head on with conflicts between science and the Bible, scientists like him often had to avoid them: . ""I don't propose certain topics which I consider taboo. Unless we are asked, we had better not mention them."" In particular, Arber is uncomfortable with the Vatican's insistence that condoms aren't the right way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, which he says is ""unrealistic."" The church maintains that condoms promote promiscuity. Both the World Health Organization and the United Nations regard condoms as highly effective at preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which kills over a million people globally every year. Arber euphemistically says he's hopeful that the new Pope Francis will help the church ""move things forward"" when it comes to tackling HIV/AIDS. Sticking points . Jeremy Webb, editor-in-chief of New Scientist magazine, also hopes the Catholic Church under Pope Francis will make an exception to its stance on condom use to fight the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. He says the speed at which new developments are emerging in the biological sciences is increasingly bringing about conflicts with the Vatican. In particular Webb sees this in relation to reproductive technologies -- such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), and egg and sperm donation -- all of which the church says are improper methods of procreation. ""The church is taking its viewpoint from 2,000-year-old teachings and trying to apply them to a modern world, which is delivering all sorts of moral dilemmas,"" he said to CNN. Webb doubts there will be any significant change in the Vatican's fundamental attitude to contraception under Francis and believes this will remain a sticking point between the biological sciences and the church. ""Catholics believe that anything that threatens the sanctity of life - including contraception - is wrong. That is a barrier and it will always be a barrier."" There have been no signals yet as to whether Pope Francis will bring about a softening of the Vatican's stance on issues such as condom-use as means to prevent suffering and early death. Werner Arber is optimistic that the Vatican will eventually catch up with the scientific evidence: ""I have hope but - as with Galileo -- it will take a long time.""

"(CNN) -- Two police officers in Indiana were killed in separate shootings in what was a violent holiday weekend in the state. In Gary, Officer Jeffrey Westerfield, a 19-year veteran of the police department, was killed early Sunday morning while responding to a call. It was his 47th birthday, CNN affiliate WLS reported. The police department called the father of four's death a ""senseless act of violence."" Authorities took three men in for questioning in connection with the shooting, CNN affiliate WLS reported. A day earlier in Indianapolis, Officer Perry Renn, a 21-year veteran, was killed while responding to a call of shots fired, the city's police department said. Renn and another officer were approaching a group of people in an alley Saturday night when a gunman shot at the officers, the department said. Police returned fire, but Renn was fatally struck in the shootout. ""This is a sad day for the IMPD family and the community as a whole,"" Police Chief Rick Hite said. The suspected gunman, 25-year-old Major Davis Jr., was also struck but survived. Authorities expect Davis to be charged with murder. Davis' grandmother told CNN affiliate WISH-TV, his family has had prior run-ins with police. Davis' father died of a heart attack while in police custody when Davis was a teenager, the family said. ""He wasn't a bad person. His father was killed by IMPD. That is enough to hurt a person and scar him for life,"" Davis' grandmother, Pam Moornan, told WISH. The death of Renn capped a violent Saturday in Indianapolis, which also saw police responding to the shooting of six men and one woman in a popular bar district, Indianapolis police Lt. Chris Bailey said. One man was in critical condition, and the others suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. Police have not identified a suspect in that shooting, and the motive remains unclear.

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 12 people have been killed in a multiple bombing Tuesday afternoon at a movie theater in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar, a hospital official said. Syed Jamil Shah, press officer for the city's Lady Reading Hospital, said at least 17 others were injured. A senior Peshawar police officer, Ijaz Ahmed, said three hand grenades hit the Shama Cinema, which is infamous in the city for showing pornographic movies. One blast was inside the cinema, and the other two outside, he told reporters. The movie theater had received security threats, and police had advised that metal detectors should be set up outside it. This advice was not heeded, Ahmed said. A witness, Waliur Rehman, told CNN he was watching a film when the blast rocked the building. People started running outside. ""There was a cloud of dust and smoke,"" he said. ""The first blast was followed by another -- and then another -- explosion."" No group or individual has claimed responsibility for the attack. Shahidullah Shahid, spokesman for the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, denied any involvement by the militant group. Peshawar, the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwest Pakistan, borders the tribal districts that are a stronghold of the Pakistan Taliban. A week ago a suicide bomber blew himself up near a hotel restaurant in Peshawar, killing nine people and injuring more than 30 others, according to local officials.

"(CNN) -- America is haunted. At least several paranormal investigators, all of whom promise to have witnessed the supernatural, told CNN they believe it to be true. That's why we've taken cues from experienced investigators and experts for fright-inspired destination ideas this Halloween season. Here are some of their favorites. Hollywood Roosevelt, California . Located on Hollywood's Walk of Fame across from Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Hollywood Roosevelt has a glamorous history: Marilyn Monroe was the hotel's most famous resident. It turns out, she might still be there, according to Brad and Sherry Steiger. Paranormal authors and investigators, the Steigers were filming at the hotel with several productions. Sherry was explaining the history of the hotel's most famous mirror, in front of which many visitors have had psychic experiences. ""And as we were standing there, a gentleman just jumped back like he'd been shoved and he said, 'Who do you think you are?' Well that stopped production and we had to find out,"" Brad said. ""I asked the man what had happened. He said, 'Well this blonde lady came running like she owns Hollywood and pushes me aside.' "" If you go: You can simply book a room at the hotel. If you want to try to spot Marilyn, the hotel offers a ""Marilyn Monroe package"" ($1,800/night) which includes a stay in the Marilyn suite and tickets to the Marilyn exhibit. Thomas House, Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee . With a history dating back to the late 1800s, the Thomas House in Red Boiling Springs began as the Cloyd Hotel. Indeed, one of the ghosts still said to roam the bed and breakfast is Sarah Cloyd. Visitors trade reports of possible deaths on the property, which may fuel activity. The hotel was featured on ""Paranormal State"" in 2009, an A&E cable network program that aired until 2011. If you go: You can go for dinner and the ""Ghosts of the Inn"" show and tour, and book a room at the bed and breakfast. The Thomas House also hosts several ""Ghost Hunt weekends,"" with the next available dates in January, 2014. The Whaley House Museum, San Diego, California . One of the Steigers' most memorable visits is ""right on the tourist map, but it still packs a metaphysical punch,"" Brad Steiger said. ""And that's the Whaley House in old San Diego."" The California house has a long history; and, like its home state, the house has been many things at different times, with origins dating back to the 1800s and including several hangings. ""It just kept growing,"" Brad said. ""It started as, the judge, his home. Then it became a courthouse and his home. Then it became a theater and his home. Then there were hangings that took place in the backyard and eventually that hanging area, where people were hanged, became part of the house."" While investigating, Sherry said she captured psychic phenomena on film -- a picture of a noose, coming right down in the room. ""I had no inkling anything would develop and lo and behold, there were so many pictures,"" she said. What should have been a photo of one of the beds instead revealed a ghostly figure, just waking up. If you go: Now a museum, tourists can take tours. St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum, Florida . First christened as a lighthouse in 1824 (it started out as a watchtower) the structure lost a long battle with the shoreline before collapsing during a storm in 1880. Luckily, its successor had already been completed in 1874. That lighthouse is now St. Augustine's oldest structure -- a status that has given it plenty of time to attract ""visitors."" What's more, a keeper's house was added to the grounds in 1876 and people lived and worked the lighthouse for decades, until 1955. The unexpected was at play at the lighthouse when investigator Jason Hawes and his team visited. They believed they would disprove the reports of activity, finding ""just local sounds and things of that nature."" ""And we actually caught some of the 'holy grail,' what appeared to be people leaning over rails, showing up on thermal, showing up on infrared when there's no one else in there,"" said Hawes, founder of the Atlantic Paranormal Society and one of the stars and producers of SyFy's long-running ""Ghost Hunters."" If you go: While other tours are available, the ""Dark of the Moon"" tour is billed as ""the only ghost tour that gets you in the tower."" Gettysburg, Pennsylvania . The town of Gettysburg has its share of haunted history. No wonder: Approximately 7,000 people died -- both Union and Confederate soldiers -- during the Battle of Gettysburg at the heart of the Civil War. (About another 3,500 died in the weeks and months following the battle.) Buell, founder of the Paranormal Research Society and host of A&E's ""Paranormal State,"" remembers getting shot there. Except he never was. ""We were taking a ghost tour of Gettysburg (National Military Park) and suddenly I was having trouble breathing ... I was wheezing and I was having trouble breathing and the pain, it got worse,"" Buell said. Buell went to the hospital, and the doctors ran some tests. ""Long story short, suddenly they come running back and they tear off my shirt and they said something like, 'Where's the exit wound?' "" Buell said. But no exit wound ever appeared on his body. If you go: There are several Gettysburg ghost tours, including Gettysburg Ghost Tours and Ghosts of Gettysburg (which is hosted by a former park ranger). Charleston and Savannah . Older cities such as Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, remind tourists that they just might be walking on bones. Savannah is ""literally built on its dead,"" Hawes said. ""When they're going to put up buildings, they have to do tests, core samples, to see if they find any bones."" Robert Edgerly, founder of one of the city's popular walking ghost tours and author of ""Savannah Hauntings,"" said that the 17hundred90 Inn is one of his favorite local spots. The 17hundred90 Inn, first built in the 1800s, is proud of its paranormal history, with an entire section of the website devoted to people's experiences. The inn's most famous resident is Anne Powell, who reportedly fell from a window to her death, though the event is clouded with rumor. Charleston is no less spooky -- especially the Old City Jail, which is famous for the prisoners kept locked behind its bars, including Lavinia Fisher, often thought of as America's first female mass murderer. If you go: Savannah visitors can book a room at the 17hundred90 Inn. Charleston features many tours, with the Ghost & Dungeon Walking Tour, Charleston's Ghost Hunt and Ghosts of the South among the options. Gilliland's Ranch, Trout Lake, Washington . Gilliland's Ranch, in Trout Lake is fairly new as a paranormal hotspot, at least measured against the decades- or centuries-plus history of some of the other locales on our list. Owned and operated by James Gilliland -- whose resume includes minister, counselor, author and radio host -- the ranch distinguishes itself in other ways: Buell said he was ""guaranteed"" to experience activity on his first visit, a rare and rarely true claim. Gilliland ""claimed he was being visited by aliens, all the time, and that there were supernatural beings on his property,"" Buell said. So a friend, another paranormal aficionado, took up the claim and reported back. ""He's like, 'I swear to you, all night long we had experiences in this place ... Every night, something happened,' "" Buell said. A big ball of light would appear and then split up into triangles and then regroup -- circling and darting unnaturally, according to Buell's friend. Many people claim to have experienced contact with extraterrestrial life at the ranch, with anecdotes spread across the Web. If you go: Contact the ranch to schedule a private tour. (Reservations are required.) Point Pleasant, West Virginia . West Virginia's Point Pleasant is synonymous with the story of the Mothman, an extraterrestrial creature sighted throughout the town in the late 1960s and made famous by the book ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" later adapted as a film starring Richard Gere. The town boasts several landmarks, including the Mothman Statue, which depicts the creature as a silvery humanoid, with teeth bared. The Lowe Hotel is nearby, offering an easy second stop on any personalized ghost tour. Not only does it house the Mothman Museum, the hotel is home to a small coterie of otherworldly figures. Many people assume the experiences in the town have stopped. Not so. While he was visiting, Buell had some ""really crazy experiences,"" including a brush with the Mothman that involved an underground munitions bunker, a voice-activated tape recorder and a psychic. ""You want to talk about something right out of 'The X-Files' -- here's Point Pleasant,"" he said. If you go: Book a room at the Lowe Hotel and take a tour of the hotel museum.

"(CNN) -- Michelle Knight wasn't the only one being held by Ariel Castro. But she knew she was different. ""I was the punching bag."" And she took it -- day after day, month after month, year after year. The terror and torment lasted from August 2002, when Castro lured Knight, then 21, into his house with the promise of a new puppy, to May 6, 2013, when she and fellow captives Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus finally tasted freedom once again. How Castro lured her to the house . Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Knight describes being chained to DeJesus, of being threatened with death if she didn't deliver Berry's baby alive and of screaming until she lost her voice in the 1,400-square-foot, two-story home on Cleveland's Seymour Avenue. What she never lost was hope. After being starved, chained and repeatedly raped, after being brutalized physically and humiliated psychologically, Knight said that she actually got stronger. It might not have helped her in Castro's eyes, but Knight stayed defiant -- so much so that it became a source of pride. ""All my life, I was made to feel insecure, like I was worthless,"" she recalled. ""And for the first time in my life, I stood up to a person that was a demeaning person."" ""And it felt good to stand up for myself, (because) I never did before."" Sensed Castro was behind other abduction . One year later, Knight is in a very different place. While Berry and DeJesus have largely stayed out of the public eye, Knight has done the opposite -- appearing at public events and writing a book, ""Finding Me,"" in hopes that her experiences will help people know they can survive anything. Castro, the daily devil in these three women's lives for so long, is now out of the picture. Arrested shortly after Berry and her then 6-year-old daughter escaped to a neighbor's house -- which led directly to the freeing of both Knight and DeJesus -- Castro killed himself in custody last September. Before last May, neighbors had known him as an affable guy who'd wave or eat ribs with them on his porch. For years, Castro drove children around in a school bus. He jammed with fellow musicians in salsa bands. But none of these people -- not even his closest relatives -- knew Castro's deep, dark secrets. Knight was the first such secret, having accepted a ride from Castro after leaving a Family Dollar store in the northern Ohio city. Nine months later, he took Berry as she walked home from her job at Burger King on the eve of her 17th birthday. Knight said when she first saw TV reports of this latest abduction, her first thought was that Castro was responsible. While the two didn't interact much -- according to Castro's rules -- Knight said that Berry got better food, blankets, ""basically whatever she wanted except for home."" ""He had a fascination with her, more than me,"" Knight recalled. ""She was the wife-type person. I was the punching bag."" Didn't speak out because 'I didn't want to get shot' In April 2004, Castro nabbed DeJesus shortly after she was last seen with his own biological daughter, Arlene, at a pay phone. Knight and DeJesus, all of 14 at the time of her kidnapping, became close in more ways than one. They were chained together by the feet inside a small room. And they leaned on each other emotionally as well. ""When we were sad and got knocked down by things that he said, we would tell each other, 'It's OK, ... one day day it will be over,'"" Knight said. ""We (tried) to encourage ourselves to keep hope that we would go home, even though sometimes we didn't feel like they were."" There was no roaming the halls, no freedom without a threat. Knight remembered going outside once and seeing other people. But she didn't dare speak up, knowing that Castro had a gun on him ""everywhere he went."" She said flatly, ""I didn't want to get shot."" 'At least I'm still alive' That threat was never more real than when Berry went into labor with Castro's child. Her paternity was later confirmed by DNA tests. The baby girl was born into a plastic tub to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid. But she wasn't breathing, said Knight, who had helped deliver the child. ""At that point in time, I knew what he said: 'If the baby didn't come out breathing, I'll kill you,'"" recalled Knight. Berry's baby delivered by another captive . Throughout her harrowing ordeal, Knight said she coped in part by remembering her own child, whom she'd given birth to at age 17. She told Cooper that she'd write songs and poems to him, among other musings ""about what happened to me (and) things that I never had, things that I wanted."" And Knight worked, as best as she could, to find something, anything positive to hold on to. ""I (would) take myself outside of myself and look at a brighter side: At least I'm not dead yet,"" she said. ""At least I'm still alive and breathing."" Michelle Knight recounts her experience to Dr. Phil . CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Michelle Knight says Ariel Castro had ""a fascination"" with fellow captive Amanda Berry .
She calls her defiance of Castro a source of pride; ""it felt good to stand up for myself""

"Moscow (CNN) -- The death toll in a Moscow metro derailment Tuesday has reached 22, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. Another 160 people are injured, of whom more than 120 were hospitalized, the Moscow health care department said. Of those, a few dozen were in critical condition. The derailment took place during morning rush hour in the Russian capital. Three metro train cars derailed in a tunnel, the state-run ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200 people were evacuated, the Emergency Ministry said on its website. Dozens of ambulances arrived at the scene, along with three helicopters, to help shuttle the injured to hospitals, ITAR-Tass said. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin declared Wednesday as a day of mourning. The cause is under investigation . It was not clear what caused the derailment, but the head of Moscow's Transportation Department said it was not a terrorist attack. However, it's still subject to a criminal investigation as authorities seek to find out what's behind the crash. In the moments afterward, many of those caught up in the derailment scrambled back up to the surface at the station west of central Moscow, some bleeding and dazed as they emerged. The rescue operation had become a recovery operation by Tuesday afternoon as emergency workers sought to free the remaining bodies from within the mangled train cars. Their efforts were made more difficult by the depth of Moscow's metro lines, on which roughly 11 million people travel daily. The metro system -- the backbone of the city's public transit network -- has been the target of past terror attacks. Train derails in northern India, killing at least 9 people .

"(CNN) -- A recent drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed one of al Qaeda's top commanders, two Pakistani security officials told CNN Tuesday. Sheikh Mohammad Fateh al Masri, described as the group's senior operational commander, was killed in North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of the country's volatile tribal region. One of the sources said al Masri was killed recently, and the other said he was killed in a strike on Sunday. The sources did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. While the United States is the only country in the region of Pakistan and Afghanistan known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes. Al Masri was emir, or leader, for Qaidat al-Jihad fi Khorasan, or the base of the jihad in the Khorasan -- the region that encompasses large areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Iran. He replaced Mustafa Abu Yazid, al Qaeda's former leader in Afghanistan, who was killed in May by a drone strike in Datta Khel in North Waziristan. And, al Masri has led military operations in Afghanistan as well as carried out attacks in Pakistan, which he viewed as a vital theater in the war. The Khorasan is considered by jihadis to be the place where they will inflict the first defeat against their enemies in the Muslim version of Armageddon. The final battle is to take place in the Levant -- Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. Mentions of the Khorasan began to increase in al Qaeda's propaganda starting in 2007. After al Qaeda's defeat in Iraq, the group began shifting its rhetoric from promoting Iraq as the central front in its jihad and have placed the focus on the Khorasan. Several U.S. military and intelligence officials said the report of al Masri's ascension to lead al Qaeda in Afghanistan is accurate. Yazid, who, like al Masri, was an Egyptian, also served as al Qaeda's chief financier and paymaster. However, little is publicly known of al Masri. According to the Asia Times, he was not a formal member of al Qaeda. Al Masri may have been a member of Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, or the Egyptian Islamic Group, an intelligence official told The Long War Journal.  That journal is an online publication that follows the U.S. campaign against al Qaeda and its allies. The Egyptian Islamic Group is a rival to Ayman al Zawahiri's Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which is believed to have formally merged with al Qaeda in June 2001.  Al Zawahiri is now the No. 2 official in al Qaeda, under leader Osama bin Laden.  The Egyptian Islamic Jihad worked closely with al Qaeda long before the formal merger, however. Egyptians hold or have held some of al Qaeda's top positions. Drone strikes have occurred regularly against militants in Pakistan. On Tuesday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed four suspected militants in the country's tribal region, two intelligence officials told CNN.  That strike followed similar attacks Saturday, Sunday and Monday that left eight suspected militants dead, the officials said. The intelligence officials said two missiles hit an alleged militant hideout in the Angoor Ada area of South Waziristan. These intelligence officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Al Masri's death comes as the CIA stepped up missile strikes in Pakistan against groups like the Haqqanis, al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistan Taliban, with the majority of strikes hitting targets in North Waziristan. Pakistan's volatile tribal region -- which borders Afghanistan -- has been targeted by drones more than 65 times this year, according to a CNN count.  September has seen more attacks than any other month since the unmanned aerial strikes began. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report .","The strike occurred in North Waziristan .

"(CNN) -- Jason Segel's weight loss is no joke. The 33-year-old star of ""How I Met Your Mother"" has been working to slim down for an upcoming comedy called ""Sex Tape,"" and recent photos show his efforts are paying off. Last week, Segel was photographed in Boston, where the movie has been filming, with a noticeably slimmer face and frame. In July, the actor told Us Weekly that he wanted to be in top shape for the R-rated feature, which also stars Cameron Diaz. ""I've just been living healthy, exercising, eating right -- no more midnight pizzas,"" Segel told the magazine. ""This time when I take my shirt off, I've made a promise to myself, it doesn't have to be funny."" It seems the star previously ""took heat"" for his naked bod in the 2008 comedy ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" but he said he understands that ""different characters require different body types."" His new comedy, about a married couple who make a sex tape only to wake up and find it missing, is going to be on the raunchy side -- ""and I'm not in shape for no reason,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A bird with an estimated 20- to 24-foot wingspan was identified in South Carolina. There's evidence that dinosaurs roamed what's now a national park in Alaska, and a 9-foot-tall stegomastodon was unearthed in New Mexico. And those are just the fossil finds made across the United States this summer. If you're fascinated by magnificent prehistoric creatures, there's plenty more exploration to be done. No need to worry about a Jurassic Park attack. These eight ""fossil finds"" offer unique family-friendly, T.-Rex-free ways for paleontologists of all ages to explore prehistoric life. So pack up your family and start uncovering some of the planet's most fascinating previous inhabitants. Denali National Park, Alaska . Just this month, as tracks of large, plant-eating dinosaur herds were discovered in Alaska's Denali National Park, scientists gained a new picture of prehistoric Arctic wildlife. The tracks ranged from 5 to 24 inches and came from hadrosaurs -- plant-eating, duck-billed dinosaurs. Hadrosaurs were prevalent during the late Cretaceous period nearly 70 million years ago, and the new tracks only add to Alaska's rich dinosaur history. ""We discovered the first dinosaur tracks in 2005, and now since we know what to look for, we've since discovered thousands of tracks,"" said Denali park ranger Kris Fister. ""Here, these tracks are unique because it houses traces of the entire ecosystem,"" she said. ""Birds, insects and plant life -- it really paints a picture of what life was in the area."" The tracks are not accessible through guided hikes or paved trails, but experienced hikers can find them nestled in Denali's back country, Fister said. Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska . What exactly is a beardog? Take a tour through the Agate Fossil Beds National Monument in Nebraska, where 20 million years ago the land now known as the Agate was a grassy plain comparable to Africa's Serengeti. At Agate, roaming animals once included the beardog (Amphicyon), a 6-foot-long hunting creature that actually is not related to the bear or the dog. There's also evidence of the dinohyus (large pig-like animal) and a short rhinoceros called a Menoceras. As rock weathered and terrain shifted, these species died off and became fossilized, and they are now visible in the Agate cliffs. Montour Fossil Pit, Pennsylvania . Stake your claim at the Montour Preserve and fossil pit, an excavation site about 230 miles northeast of Pittsburgh where visitors can dig for fossils. Montour's marine fossils date to the Devonian Period, about 400 million years ago. And even more fun: All collected artifacts are yours to keep. Fossils include trilobites (relatives of horseshoe crabs with segmented bodies and frog-like eyes), pelecypods (early ancestors of oysters, mussels and clams) and gastropods (snails). One tip: Wait until after a good rain shower to go fossil hunting. Sometimes the rain can make the fossils easier to spot in the rock. Dinosaur National Monument, Utah . The Quarry Exhibit Hall is the unquestioned star of Dinosaur National Monument's show. About 1,500 dinosaur bones from up to 149 million years ago and an 80-foot mural reveal the history of the dinosaurs and their eventual demise. Bone displays include meat-eating reptiles like the 20-foot long Allosaurus and massive, grass-eating dinos like the Camarasaurus, Diplodocus and Stegosaurus. Outside the exhibit hall, this monument to dinosaurs still has a rich variety of wildlife throughout the area. Adventurous visitors can take a whitewater rafting trip through remote canyon areas. Hell Creek Beds, Montana . Hell Creek is a fossil lover's heaven. Expansive and well-preserved, the rock bed formation spans four states -- Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming -- although the main park is squarely in Montana. Fossils date to the late Cretaceous period, 65 million to 70 million years ago, and were discovered in 1902 by paleontologist Barnum Brown. Today, families can take guided, private day digging tours with experienced paleontologists to hunt fossils. And in Hell Creek, abundant species include the distinctively horned ceratopsians; the duck-billed herbivore creatures called hadrosaurs; and theropods, the lizard-like carnivorous dinosaurs. But there's another reason historians love the Hell Creek beds: The chemical presence of iridium in some rocks gives credence to the theory of a dinosaur extinction caused by a meteor. Ghost Ranch, New Mexico . Play Ghost (Ranch) buster at this spot's Museum of Paleontology. This New Mexican museum includes bones of the coelophysis, a slender, two-legged carnivore that was over 9 feet long and grazed the ranch's grassy plains nearly 220 million years ago. Other dinosaurs on display include the 6-foot-long therapod Tawa hallae and Vancleavea, an underwater reptile. After a tour of the museum, venture into the Coelophysis Quarry, where red beds of rock have preserved the remains of at least 1,000 rare species. Red Gulch Dinosaur Tracksite, Wyoming . With walkways and set excavation areas, Red Gulch Dinosaur Tracksite in Wyoming is the perfect site for an introduction to paleontology and dino-digging. Plus, the track site, named for being an area where footprints and fossils are preserved, includes managers of the excavation sites to help beginning visitors identify dinosaur tracks in the sand. Fossil collection is permitted on most days, barring road closures and fire danger, and the rewards for a fossil hunt are great. Trilobites, brachiopods (shell creatures) and all invertebrate fossils can be collected for personal use and without permit. And some of those fossils date 167 million years. However, if you want to search like a professional paleontologist for vertebrate fossils -- with bones and teeth -- a permit is required. La Brea Tar Pits at the Page Museum, California . They call it Excavation 101. And it begins with a fossil deposit, a grid and the careful removal of dirt to find a bone. Part of the Page Museum in Los Angeles, the La Brea Tar Pits' outside pits and the museum's inside exhibits create a must-see attraction for West Coast fossil lovers. There are outside options where viewers can observe excavations of California's rich wildlife, explore prehistoric fossils and learn the basics of excavation. At the Page Museum, visitors look at expansive fossil exhibits, including full replicas of the smilodon, an extinct saber-toothed cat. The museum's Fossil Lab allows visitors to peer though the glass walls to watch fossils get cleaned, enhanced and prepared for viewing.","There have been dinosaur finds across the United States this summer .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The reboot of ""The View"" is now complete, with ABC announcing that actress Rosie Perez and political analyst Nicolle Wallace will be the new panelists. They will join comedienne Rosie O'Donnell, whose addition was announced earlier, and Whoopi Goldberg, the only one remaining from the last season of the show. When the show returns September 15, it will boast a complete retool -- a new logo and a new producer and, of course, new hires. Perez, who first garnered attention with her role in Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing,"" is a regular on screen and stage. Wallace was a senior advisor to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and communications director for President George W. Bush. They both served as guest co-hosts last season. O'Donnell co-hosted ""The View"" during its 10th season in 2006-07. Her on-air battles with then-co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck -- over issues like the Iraq war, which O'Donnell was vehemently against -- were loud and legendary. Producers are hoping for similar magic with her rejoining. Changes at the talk show commenced in May, when one of its co-creators and original co-host, Barbara Walters, stepped down. Along with Walters, two other co-hosts have stepped down -- Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy.","Perez is a regular on screen and stage .

"(CNN) -- Last week, the Internet was buzzing with the news that a DNA test of white supremacist Craig Cobb revealed that 14% of his genes originated in sub-Saharan Africa. The look on Cobb's face as he received the news? Priceless. Cobb appeared on ""The Trisha Show"" and discussed his plans to create an all-white town for white supremacists in Leith, North Dakota. ""Whites are the highest expression of DNA on the planet,"" he said on the show. When Cobb received the DNA results, he wrote it off. ""This is called statistical noise,"" Cobb responded. ""Oil and water don't mix."" Well, apparently we aren't talking oil and water, are we Mr. Cobb? We're talking human beings -- and they've been mixing since the beginning of time. That history is what created the ""one-drop rule"" in America: a legal classification that held that anyone with as little as ""one drop"" of African or black ancestry was to be categorized as black and treated accordingly. Until 1967, when it was ruled unconstitutional, the ""one-drop rule"" provided the legal and quantitative definition of blackness, and whiteness. So while Cobb might ""look white"" today, in 1813 or 1913, his 14% African ancestry would have been more than enough to render him black by law. In 2013, however, the irony of his heritage shows just how nuanced racial identity is beyond skin color. During the period of American slavery, 1619 to 1865, freedom was predicated on skin color. If you were white, you were free; if you were black, you were enslaved. But this simple social order soon became complicated by miscegenation; and with the rampant increase in racial mixing, the lines between white and black, free and enslaved, became more and more blurred. Whites were afraid of losing their control over the enslaved population. They needed to maintain a firm color line. So, state governments began instituting anti-miscegenation laws. Various and varying articulations of the ""one-drop rule"" emerged: a classification that held that anyone from 1/8 to 1/16 to 1/32 to any known trace of African or black ancestry was to be categorized as black and treated accordingly. How that ""drop"" was measured varied from state to state. The rhetoric of white supremacy not only argued that the races were distinctly different, but also that the black race specifically was inferior, therefore justifying enslavement. Mixing, then, lowered human quality. In order to maintain its superiority, whiteness had to remain pure. So, what it meant to be white was to be free of ""otherness"" in general, blackness, specifically. In this way, miscegenation was a threat to the survival of the white race. The ""one-drop rule,"" then, became critical in its defense. To be white in America was to be ""pure."" Or was it? A 2002 study of racial admixture conducted by Penn State University molecular anthropologist Mark Shriver showed that among those who self-identify as white, upward of 30% have at least 2.3% African ancestry -- the equivalent of having had three black ancestors somewhere within the previous five generations of their family. What that means, then, is that 30% of the folks who call themselves white have much more than one drop, including white supremacist Craig Cobb. DNA testing also reveals that somewhere around 60% of black Americans have white ancestry, Shriver's study found. Taken together, it's clear that racial purity is as much a delusion as white supremacy. Blood does not define identity. Although the ""one-drop rule"" in many ways serves foundational to black American racial identity, and has functioned to draw borders around the black community as we know it, one drop of ""blackness"" -- whatever that is -- does not constitute black identity. Blackness, as an identity and as a lived experience, is much more complex and nuanced than any number of drops on a family tree. Blackness is as much about who creates you as it is about what you make of yourself. So, while I was thoroughly amused by the sight of Craig Cobb's face when he learned that he, too, is ""of African descent,"" I am clear that those DNA test results do not magically make him black; no number of drops ever could. And blackness is too beautiful to be forced upon people who don't want it. So no worries, Mr. Cobb, your secret's safe with me. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yaba Blay.","White supremacist Craig Cobb learned that 14% of his genes originated in sub-Saharan Africa .

"(CNN) -- A Beijing-bound United Airlines flight returned to Washington's Dulles International Airport Thursday evening because of a child custody investigation. United Airlines Flight 897 took off on time at 12:20 p.m. ET, but had to return to Dulles at the request of federal law enforcement, an airline spokesperson said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had received an alert that a mother on that flight was allegedly taking her child out of the country illegally, an FBI spokesman told CNN. Upon the flight's return ""the flight was met by law enforcement including FBI agents and three individuals were removed from the plane to include a grandmother, mother and child,"" FBI spokesman Andrew Ames confirmed, via email. ""The mother was taken into custody on suspicion of committing an international parental kidnapping and the child was reunited with the father. The grandmother was not detained."" The criminal complaint charges that Wenjing Liu, also known as Linda Liu, unlawfully attempted ""to remove a child from the United States with intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights."" After separating and starting divorce proceedings in 2013, Liu and William J. Ruifrok III were awarded joint custody of their 4-year-old son, who was born in China and is a dual U.S.-Chinese citizen, the complaint stated. The 2014 custody agreement doesn't allow either party to travel outside of the United States without ""express written and notarized consent of the other party, provided in advance of the trip,"" according to the complaint. In an interview with law enforcement after being removed from the flight, Liu admitted violating the custody order by removing her son from the United States without his father's consent, according to the complaint. She made her first appearance in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia on Friday and has a bond hearing scheduled for Monday. After the aircraft returned to Dulles, United assigned a new crew due to crew flight time limits, and the flight departed again for Beijing at 7:47 pm ET, the United spokesperson said. CNN's initial attempts to reach a representative for Liu were not successful. It's a federal crime in the United States for parents to take or attempt to take their children out of the United States or keep them out of the country to obstruct another parent's custodial rights. But while federal authorities may prosecute one parent, they can't necessarily return a child who is already outside the country to the other parent. About one quarter of the 1,800 to 2,000 annual missing children reports received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children are for international parental abductions, according to Maureen Heads, a supervisor in the center's missing children division. The U.S. Department of State tries to return kidnapped children through negotiation, sometimes made easier if the other country is also a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Parental Child Abduction. The United States and more than 70 other countries have signed the convention, but it only applies if both countries involved are signatories. ""That leaves many countries where there is no partner"" for the United States to negotiate with, said Heads. ""It can be a real challenge at times for parents."" China is not a signatory to the convention, which Heads said could have made it harder for the father in the United Airlines case to get his child back. Seat recline fight diverts another flight .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investigating ""disturbing evidence of inhumane treatment of cattle"" at a California meat supplier, the agency said. After receiving video from an animal welfare group, the USDA sent investigators to the Central Valley Meat Co. and found violations of humane handling, the agency said in a statement. Jane Velez-Mitchell: Slaughterhouse video shows USDA needs to clean up its act . ""We have reviewed the video and determined that while some of the footage provided shows unacceptable treatment of cattle, it does not show anything that would compromise food safety,"" said Al Almanza, administrator of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The USDA suspended inspections at the Hanford-based company, effectively halting slaughter operations there. The agency said Wednesday it bought 21 million pounds of beef for federal food programs in fiscal year 2011, nearly one-sixth of its beef purchases. Would you eat a burger grown in a lab? Company officials have not seen the video, Brian Coelho, president of the Central Valley Meat Co., said Tuesday. He said he was ""extremely disturbed"" to learn that inspections were suspended. ""Our company seeks to not just meet federal humane handling regulations, but to exceed them,"" Coelho said in a statement. He said federal inspectors continuously inspect the plant and are able to take action if they see a problem. ""That is why these allegations are both disturbing and surprising,"" he said. Central Valley did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday after CNN sent the company a link to the video. The company did not respond to messages left Wednesday. Compassion Over Killing, a nonprofit organization that focuses on animal cruelty, posted the video to YouTube and to its website on Tuesday. The group said an undercover investigator shot the video. In the graphic video, one worker stands on the nostrils of a cow that the narrator says has been shot in the head but didn't die right away. In another segment, a worker appears to shoot a cow in the head several times. ""At U.S. slaughterhouses, federal law requires death to be quick, when cows are shot in the head the process should cause immediate unconsciousness,"" the narrator says. ""At Central Valley, countless deaths we documented were slow and agonizing."" US buying $170 million in meat from farmers hit by high feed prices . Central Valley Meat, a 50-year-old company, was one of the beef suppliers for In-N-Out Burger, a well-known fast food chain predominantly in California and the Southwest.

""In-N-Out Burger would never condone the inhumane treatment of animals, and all of our suppliers must agree to abide by our strict standards for the humane treatment of cattle,"" he said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- I am an underdog in life. From the moment I entered the world, I was handed a collection of circumstances that most first world people would label as ""disadvantages."" I grew up in a poor, single parent family. My dark features and Middle Eastern last name further complicated my Midwestern upbringing. I didn't look like anyone else (including my mother). Racism, economic hardship, and familial struggles were my everyday reality from the beginning. But I am not the only underdog out there. Maybe you or someone close to you also has underdog status. Our individual stories are likely different, but the biographical details matter far less than the significant and perhaps surprisingly positive traits those obstacles have the power to nurture. Ask someone who they are and how they got there, and many will begin by describing the hurdles they've encountered -- the repeated rejection, the failed pursuits, the periods of scrimping. So much of how we understand ourselves is shaped by our losses and hardships, even more so than our victories. But as uncomfortable as they are, these personal roadblocks make us stronger and better than our more privileged selves. In Malcolm Gladwell's new book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants, he argues that being the underdog and experiencing disadvantages breeds ""desirable difficulties."" But how much of what's ""desirable"" is about perspective? Challenges don't improve us merely because they exist. We have to reflect on them and proactively adapt their lessons into our life and work habits. The immense potential of these desirable difficulties is especially salient in the workplace. Read more: How 5 of world's leading executives streamline their productivity . Here's why underdogs win in the workplace: . 1. We're less likely to take things (and people) for granted. Once you've felt the pangs of struggle, you don't easily forget it, particularly if it's experienced early in life. At work, this means underdogs are more likely to notice the little things and demonstrate appreciation. Gratitude makes people happier, and since happiness is contagious, it also positively affects your coworkers. That doesn't mean we're all 24/7 bundles of cheer, but when you grow up without and have a desire for something better, you develop an inherent optimism and immunity to complacency. 2. We have rich imaginations. Learning to do without demands creativity. Underdogs are well-versed in the art of improvisation; it's necessary for our survival. We're scrappy. Last minute changes to a presentation? An accelerated deadline? If all other qualifications are relatively equal, I'll choose the underdog to work on my team every time. Underdogs spend their lives imagining ""more,"" which is invaluable in business. Everyday improvisation leads to large-scale innovation, which transforms how we work and what we collectively produce. Read more: Deadly sins needn't always be fatal for your career . 3. We are hyper-actively observant. When you're an outsider, you vigilantly pay attention to what it takes to ""fit in."" Details and differences are not lost on underdogs. We quickly size up a situation and analyze how to optimize it. Obliviousness is difficult to correct, and underdogs are aware by necessity -- a sort of ""mindful compensation."" Being an underdog doesn't mean you're a fraud when you do manage to find your way into more fortunate circles, but it does mean you had to become intimately familiar with the nuances of the rules to get there. This makes underdogs competitive players to watch (and hire). 4. We are not risk averse. If you've never had a safety net, then you feel like you don't have much to lose. That doesn't mean underdogs are inherently reckless, but it does bode well for taking calculated risks. Being an entrepreneur, for instance, means you are likely to ""fail"" at some point -- but it also means you could score big eventually. And it's not about luck (though many will flippantly dismiss it as such), but rather perseverance, resilience, tenacity, and general strength of character that leads us to succeed. Underdogs don't take no for an answer and, perhaps counter-intuitively, tend to be very confident (while arguably less arrogant) -- because without that unbridled confidence, we would still be stuck in our previous reality. It takes a pretty serious belief in yourself to rise above those circumstances. Read more: What football managers can teach you about leadership . 5. We are very hungry. If there's one thing I know how to do, it's hustle. With underdogs, the default answer is ""yes."" Yes, I can learn how to do that. Yes, I can make that happen. Yes, that is possible. Will this can-do attitude backfire? Possibly, sometimes. But more often than not, that inner drive and hunger to excel means we're willing to acquire new skills, push ourselves out of our comfort zone (what comfort zone?), and work toward goals with laser-sharp focus. Being an underdog in life has shaped my character and my career, making me more successful and, ultimately, happier. But while being an underdog can make you pretty bad-ass in the workplace, let us not glamorize hardship. Because make no mistake: It's difficult. Most of us wouldn't want to repeat the past, and we diligently strive for a better future with fewer difficulties for our offspring. And yet, I for one would not change the personal challenges I've been dealt. Underdog status is what you make of it. It's not a label I'm looking to overcome. It's a permanent state of being for me. It reminds me everyday what it took to get where I am, how much I have to be grateful for, and how much room I still have to grow. Being an underdog isn't a plea for sympathy. It's an invitation to triumph. Read more: Women value ethics more than men . Read more: Are we ready for GenY leaders?

"Washington (CNN) -- Political newcomer Ken Vaughn is betting big on his own run for Congress. The first-time candidate believes so strongly in the need for a new brand of leaders in Washington that, after careful consideration with his wife, he's cashed in a large chunk of his 401(k) in order to invest $100,000 in his campaign. ""It's not nearly enough to win, but it's enough to get started,"" he said. ""It takes a lot of money to run for office, but that's what it takes and like any businessman or whatever, you have to do what the job takes."" A traffic engineer by trade, Vaughn is running for a House seat in Virginia's 11th Congressional District. If he wins the Republican primary set to take place in June, he'll take on two-term Democrat Gerald Connolly. His campaign's central issue is the national debt. ""I am terribly concerned about what our congressmen are doing to this country with the debt, and we have to make a change,"" he told participants at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast last week in Woodbridge, Virginia, where he was seeking signatures to get on the ballot. ""It's only a few years before everything is going to collapse just like it did in Greece and unfortunately, we don't have anyone to bail us out."" While government spending is Vaughn's chief concern, as a candidate he'll have to worry about a different kind of spending: his own campaign's. It's getting more and more expensive to run for political office. ""The cost of seeking office whether it's for state legislature or a governorship or a member of the U.S. House or Senate, these costs have been going up for decades,"" said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies elections and campaign finance issues. ""It's kind of amusing to look back say to the 1970s, and you'll find many members of Congress then were spending, oh, $75,000, $100,000, $200,000 -- now that would almost be a rounding error."" Long odds . In 2010, the average winning House candidate spent about $1.4 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That's 70% more than a decade ago. The average price for winning a Senate seat reached nearly $10 million in that cycle. The high cost of running for federal office often puts newcomers facing well-known incumbents -- who often have more financial backing from supporters and political parties -- at a substantial disadvantage. ""There's always an instinct on the part of incumbent members -- incumbent office holders -- to build a war chest even if they may not need to use a penny of it, and as a consequence challengers, those who are trying to break through for the first time, face an increasingly daunting challenge in raising enough money to get themselves known,"" Mann said. ""There's not much room, not much opportunity for ordinary folks of modest income and wealth hoping to break into politics. It's a costly business. It's a highly competitive business and they face long odds."" Brig. Gen. John Douglass, a first-time candidate who's running in Virginia's 10th Congressional District, is hoping to beat those odds. The former Air Force general and one-time assistant U.S. Navy secretary was an active supporter of Hillary Clinton and later Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential race, and he was recruited by the Democratic party last year to run against Republican Frank Wolf, who's been in the House of Representatives for more than three decades. ""I think that right now our country desperately needs leadership in the Congress. I think particularly the House is in a stalemate right now,"" Douglass said, after a morning spent making fundraising calls from the kitchen of his farm house in Hume, Virginia. ""I think I can add something to the national debate on where our country should be going. I think we are kind of at a tipping point. When I was asked by the party to consider running, I couldn't say no."" Douglass has been a long-time advocate of early childhood education, which he says is an economic issue as well as a national security issue, another area where he believes his experience makes him a strong candidate. Unable to finance his campaign himself, Douglass has traveled extensively across his district talking to voters, but he says he spends at least 75% of his days on the telephone trying to raise money. Working with his small staff, he's made about 9,000 donor calls since May and has raised some $500,000. He hopes to raise another million for his race. Before running, Douglass had not paid much attention to the fundraising aspect of campaigns. ""I don't think that's something that's on the average American's radar screen,"" he said. ""You hear a lot of it being talked about now because of the presidential election and the enormous amounts of money that have to go into a successful campaign for the presidency and so it is an issue that I think all of us Americans are learning more about."" High hopes . Both candidates are trying to keep their costs down this early in the campaign. Vaughn spends about $500 a month for rent on his newly opened campaign office, $50 a month for telephone service and about $5,000 a month on staff, and he's also been relying on volunteers. Douglass has three staffers and sometimes works out of the county Democratic headquarters to save money. The big expenses will come a few months from now, when much of the money the candidates raise will go to advertising. A Wesleyan Media Project analysis of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG found that television ads for candidates running for Congress in 2010 racked up nearly 1.6 million airings at an estimated cost of $735 million, an amount that represents 61% increase over 2008. ""It's definitely an uphill battle, but we also definitely have a shot, even more than a shot,"" Douglass said. Vaughn, who spoke with his pastor and prayed about whether to launch his candidacy, says ""normal people"" have to get out and run for office if they're going to make a difference. For him it comes down to faith. ""Our country needs this,"" he said. ""If you look at it from my Christian faith, I look at it as God will provide a way so, you know, it's daunting, but we're headed straight forward and we'll do the work that has to be done.""","In 2010, the average winning House candidate spent about 70% more than a decade ago .

"(CNN) -- If you lose a leg, insurance will likely cover the cost of your prosthesis. If you lose your arm, it's the same. Even if you lose your ability to perform sexually, more than likely your Viagra is covered. But if you start to lose your hearing, far too often you are on your own. If hearing loss were officially considered a disability, it would rank as the largest disability class in the country. Some 37 million people suffer from hearing loss, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that number will only grow as the population ages. Yet most private medical insurance doesn't cover the cost of hearing aids. While the Department of Veterans Affairs often pays for them, in most cases Medicare, which covers many more people, does not. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage to include newborn hearing screenings when it passed in 2010, but that was the single preventive-care expansion related to hearing problems. It would take an actual act of Congress to change it further. Only 19 states require that health benefits plans in their states pay for hearing aids; most cover children only, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Only three states require coverage for both children and adults. When private insurance does pay, it typically covers the cost of an exam to assess hearing loss, and that's about it. The devices are expensive, sometimes costing in the $1,000 to $6,000 range -- and that's per ear. Perhaps this explains, at least in part, why 75% to 80% of adults with hearing loss do not get hearing aids, according to a recent study done by Virginia Ramachandran, a senior staff audiologist in the Division of Audiology of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. Her study showed the only group that consistently got hearing aids had insurance that paid for them in full. Hearing aids are considered elective, much like plastic surgery or liposuction. But unlike those cosmetic procedures, life without hearing can have devastating effects. It can leave people feeling isolated or depressed and may even lead to serious illnesses like dementia. It can put their safety at risk. ""It's really an invisible disability,"" said Laura Hansen, owner of Assist2Hear, a Littleton, Colorado-based hearing assistance company. She got involved in the profession after seeing her father struggle when he started losing his hearing. No one was there to really advocate for him, she said. ""You know, I think it stays invisible in part because of our culture,"" she said. ""My parents' generation kind of accepted their hearing loss as just a way of life, and they didn't want to fuss with the technology, but ultimately they ended up isolating themselves."" Audiologist Virginia Ramachandran would agree. ""People don't always perceive that they need (hearing aids), because hearing loss comes on gradually. Usually they are the last person to know. Eventually, though, we all go through this,"" Ramachandran said. We start losing our hearing as early as our 20s, but most people aren't aware of it -- or they're in denial. ""Maybe it's because it makes people think about their mortality, or it makes them feel old,"" Ramachandran said. ""I had one 90-year-old patient who came to me and when I confirmed they did have hearing loss, they said, 'I don't understand what could have caused this.' I had to tell them as we mature, this is a natural part of the process."" Most people Hansen talks to are surprised that hearing aids aren't typically covered by insurance. She said she thinks that will change as her baby boom generation gets older and needs them more. ""Unlike our parents' generation, we are not afraid to complain. I do think you'll see a lot more pressure on the government and on private companies to pay for more,"" Hansen said. But until then, don't expect to see this change any time soon. ""There are 35 other mandated benefits you have to cover,"" said Susan Pisano, vice president of communications for America's Health Insurance Plans, a professional association that represents the health insurance industry. ""To add something else -- especially with the high cost of health care, which will only continue to go up -- it is going to be a hard argument to make."" Where the argument might get easier is with children. ""Hearing devices are an absolute necessity for children,"" Ramachandran said. ""They are still developing speech and language, so they need to hear. Older people do need them, but they have an advantage over children with hearing loss. They already have experience with language, and their brain can sometimes fill in the gap with words they don't always hear. Children don't have that experience, and untreated hearing loss will severely hurt their development."" Jocelyn Ross knows that worry all too well. Her daughter Alyssa, born in 2009, is one of the 13,000 or so children born in the U.S. each year with congenital hearing loss. It is one of the most common sensory birth defects. In South Carolina, where the Ross family lives, roughly 4% of infants fail the newborn hearing screening, according to Ross. Yet none of them receive any help under the state's public health law. Ross is trying to change that. She founded Let South Carolina Hear and helped persuade a state legislator to introduce a bill this year that would cover at least part of the cost. The legislation didn't make it through this session, but Ross is hopeful it will pass someday. She needs to be. Ross says each of her daughter's behind-the-ear hearing aids cost $2,500. The devices require constant adjustment and will need to be replaced every few years as Alyssa grows older. If Ross lived in neighboring North Carolina, at least some of the cost of Alyssa's devices would be covered, but because she lives in South Carolina, that cost comes out of her pocket. ""This is a major life function, especially for children,"" Ross said. ""I don't want her to have any limits, and with the devices she can do anything she wants to do. This is an expense that would be hard for anyone, but you do what you have to do."" She says she worries, though, about the families that can't find that $2,500, and wonders what happens to their children, because she's seen how much hearing aids have transformed her daughter's life. ""Even when she was 2, she would point to her ears if the batteries got low,"" Ross said. ""She only takes them off when she wants to go to sleep. She wants very much to be a part of the world, and she needs them to do this -- and so do so many others."" Have you experienced hearing loss? How do you feel about this?

"(CNN) -- Charles Everett Brownlow Jr.'s mother is dead. So is his aunt. The same goes for two of his acquaintances, plus a convenience store worker in his hometown of Terrell, Texas, some 30 miles east of Dallas. Yet rather than preparing for their funerals, Brownlow is likely planning his defense -- from jail. All five of the deceased died violently, found over a busy and bloody six-hour stretch Monday night within miles of each other in Terrell. As of Tuesday afternoon, the 36-year-old Brownlow faced a single charge of murder, in the death of the Ali's Market worker, the only victim it is believed the suspect did not know. But Terrell police Chief Jody Lay made clear that ""additional capital murder charges"" are anticipated. ""This is a country community, a rural community,"" Lay said Tuesday. ""People are really close. And this is going to have a really big impact on us."" The chaos began around 5 p.m. Monday with reports of a gunshot victim. Police arrived to find a dead woman -- later determined to be Belinda Walker, Terrell's 55-year-old aunt -- with at least one bullet wound to the head. About a half hour later, a firefighter noticed that a nearby home was on fire, Lay explained. These flames were quickly extinguished, and authorities found another woman's body. This was Charles Brownlow's house, and the victim was Mary Brownlow, his 61-year-old mother. Investigators determined the two deaths -- like the victims -- appeared related and issued an alert to law enforcement to look for Charles Brownlow and the white 2002 Ford Focus he was believed to be driving, Lay explained. As law enforcement looked, more gunshots were reported elsewhere in Terrell, with no one injured and the shooter getting away in a white vehicle. A report of another shooting came in around 10:30 p.m., where a man and vehicle matching the bulletin had been spotted. Police went in the home and found 33-year-old Jason Wooden and 30-year-old Kelleye Sluder -- both of whom lived there, both now shot dead. Lay said later that ""all indications are that (Brownlow) knew those victims,"" adding only that ""they hung out occasionally."" It was a mere 10 minutes later when an off-duty police officer spotted the Ford Focus and, after closer examination, the suspect inside Ali's Market. Later, 22-year-old worker Luis Gerardo Leal-Carillo was found slain there. A high-speed pursuit followed, ending in a dead-end. The suspect stopped his car, got out, then fled -- shielded by heavy brush and the dark night sky. Authorities stopped chasing him about 150 feet in, instead setting up a wide perimeter and calling in a state Department of Public Safety helicopter. That helicopter's crew and officers on the ground ultimately located Brownlow hiding in a creek around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday and took him into custody ""without incident."" Only one weapon was involved in the crimes, said Lay, who did not describe it. Hours later, disbelief, disgust and sadness permeated Terrell. An emotional Ali Karimi, the owner of Ali's Market, told CNN affiliate WFAA that he and the world had ""lost a good, honest, caring individual"" in Leal-Carillo. ""I loved him as a person,"" Karimi said of his slain employee. ""I loved him like a son."" And Terrence Walker, who identified himself as the suspect's brother, told WFAA that he was at a ""total loss"" to explain what happened -- including to their mother, Mary Brownlow, whom Walker described as ""so quiet and good."" ""I'm devastated,"" Walker told the station. ""... I'm in a daze."" Charles Brownlow was in police custody Tuesday facing one count of evading arrest in a vehicle in addition to the murder charge. His listed address is the home that was burned down. It was not known who will represent him in court; CNN's call to the Kaufman County public defender's office on Tuesday was not immediately returned. A public records search indicated Brownlow previously had been convicted on theft, burglary, weapons, assault of a family member and marijuana possession and other charges, though nothing close to this scale. So how do authorities explain this week's bloodshed? Lay said that authorities have ""several theories that we're working,"" though he wouldn't go further than that. And asked about Brownlow's condition at the time of the arrest, the police chief said he did ""appear to be intoxicated on some sort of substance, (but) at this point we don't have a real good idea exactly what that is."" As horrific as the events were, Lay said that it might have even worse had the off-duty officer not spotted the suspect at the Terrell market. ""All I can say is, I think that had the police officer not intervened,"" Lay said, ""I was very concerned that we would have additional situations that we would have to had to deal with that night."" CNN""s Marlena Baldacci and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Police: The victims include the suspect's mother, aunt and 2 acquaintances .

"(CNN) -- When I was a kid, I remember a guy named Daniel Ellsberg leaking some classified documents to the New York Times about the Vietnam War called ""the Pentagon Papers."" When the whistle-blower finally stood trial for espionage, my parents weren't quite sure how to feel. But when Richard Nixon's crew was revealed to have been conducting illegal wiretaps in an effort to discredit the former intelligence contractor, well, they were outraged and decided Ellsberg was a hero. So did the judge and most of America. I wonder whether Ed Snowden, the 29-year-old Booz Allen Hamilton employee behind last week's series of leaks about National Security Agency surveillance on the American public, will be rewarded with the same admiration. You'd think we would be even more outraged by what he uncovered than we were by the surveillance of Ellsberg. After all, it's not just one lone loose cannon being wiretapped here, it's all of us being monitored. Snowden has not uncovered a human conspiracy here but the workings of the machine itself. And it's a machine that really does require some human intervention. In the coming months, I expect a campaign to be waged against this young man that will make the one against Ellsberg look like child's play. His enemies have the full force of the machine -- every e-mail he's written and every phone call he's made -- to use against him. This won't be pretty. But before we decide that Snowden was smiling too much in his videotaped interview with The Guardian, earned too much money or somehow betrayed his lovely girlfriend in Hawaii in a personal vendetta against his former bosses at the intelligence agencies, let's take just a moment to consider his particularly human act of heroism. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of government employees and contractors who have long been aware of the NSA's total surveillance effort. What next for Snowden? As a digital technology writer, I have had more than one former student and colleague tell me about digital switchers they have serviced through which calls and data are diverted to government servers or the big data algorithms they've written to be used on our e-mails by intelligence agencies. I always begged them to write about it or to let me do so while protecting their identities. They refused to come forward and believed my efforts to shield them would be futile. ""I don't want to lose my security clearance. Or my freedom,"" one told me. Snowden was willing to take those risks and, I daresay, more. Yet it wasn't just fear keeping people from talking about the growing cybersurveillance state but a sense of inevitability. This is just how technology evolves, at least when it's uncontested. Everyone knows, or should know, that everything we type on our computers or say into our cell phones is being disseminated throughout the datasphere. And most of it is recorded and parsed by big data servers. Why do you think Gmail and Facebook are free? You think they're corporate gifts? We pay with our data. In such an environment, it's hard to come down too hard on government intelligence officers who want to get in on this action. Our leaders are suffering from what I call ""present shock"": the overwhelming assault of multiple threats from everywhere at the same time, amplified by technology of all sorts. Terrorists have unprecedented access to weapons of mass destruction and work through decentralized networks around the clock. As data-gathering tools emerge with ever-increasing ability to keep tabs on the world's communications, how can an overburdened intelligence agency choose otherwise than to exploit their potential? The rush to employ technology has become automatic. Called a defector, leaker defends his decision . We all know the feeling of surrendering to the embedded biases of our devices. We let our cell phones ping us every time there's an incoming message and check our e-mail even when we'd best pay attention to what's going on around us in the real world. We text while driving. Likewise, without conscious restraint, government agencies can't help but let the growing power of big data draw them into ever more invasive forms of surveillance on a population whose members simply must include those who intend harm on the rest. This is just how everything runs when it's left on ""default"" settings. Yet if we let the evolution of our machines dictate the evolution of our policy, the only possible result is what Snowden calls ""turnkey tyranny."" As I have argued in other contexts, the best weapon against the paralysis of technologically induced present shock is human intervention. Just as we the people stood against the structural tyranny of an overreaching monarchy, it is we the people who must stand against the structural tyranny of runaway technology. Snowden is a hero because he realized that our very humanity was being compromised by the blind implementation of machines in the name of making us safe. Unlike those around him, who were too absorbed in their task to reflect on their actions and pause in their pursuit of digital omniscience, Snowden allowed himself to be ""disturbed"" by what he was doing. More in the midst of technology than most of us will ever be, Snowden disengaged for long enough to be human and to consider the impact of what he was helping build. He pressed pause. Thank heavens our intelligence agencies are staffed by people like Snowden, not robots. People can still think. That's why they call it intelligence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Daniel Ellsberg became a hero for his role in disclosing the Pentagon Papers .

"(CNN) -- Do you prefer to get a text message or a phone call if someone wants to reach you on your cell phone? According to a new study from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 31% of American adults prefer text messages to phone calls. An additional 14% said the contact method they prefer depends on the situation. To put this in perspective, most Americans (but just barely: 53%) still generally prefer to get voice calls rather than text messages. Also, Pew notes that 4% of cell owners do not make or receive any voice calls on an average day. And 27% of cell owners do not use text messaging, even occasionally. Not surprisingly, younger adults are especially likely to use texting. According to Pew, ""Cell owners between the ages of 18 and 24 exchange an average of 109.5 messages on a normal day -- more than 3,200 texts per month. And the typical or median cell owner in this age group sends or receives 50 messages per day (or 1500 messages per month)."" Also, the rate of texting for 18- to 24-year-olds is ""more than double the comparable figure for 25-34 year olds, and 23 times the figure for text messaging users who are 65 or older."" Whether individuals prefer to get text messages rather than voice calls appears to have a large correlation with how heavily they use text messaging. For instance, 55% of people who send or receive more than 51 texts per day report preferring them to phone calls. However, since younger adults are most likely to be heavy texters, this preference does indirectly correlate with age. Why some prefer texting . Why do some people prefer texting to voice calls? Pew did not speculate on this, but How Stuff Works suggests some relative advantages of texting. First, privacy: it's far less likely that an SMS conversation can be overheard. (Conversely, this can also be a matter of courtesy; don't you wish more people in public settings would use text messaging rather than voice calls, if they must communicate with someone right that minute?) Also, text messaging provides greater accessibility, not just for people with hearing impairments but also to compensate for ambient noise, weak or spotty cell network connections, or the poor quality of microphones and speakers that plague many cell phones. But perhaps the main reasons why many people prefer getting text messages over voice calls are related to time. Typically, text messaging encourages briefer, more efficient exchanges of information. Even ""social grooming"" chitchat often gets abbreviated so it's quicker to type and read -- although in the context of texting culture, this isn't necessarily viewed as colder or less socially or emotionally significant. Similarly, there's less psychological or social pressure to respond immediately to texts. So you can take a moment to finish a task at hand (such as parking your car) or to consider what you want to say before responding to a text message. Text messaging also can reduce the discomfort or impatience some people experience with pauses in real-time voice conversations -- or the chance that they may instantly blurt a response that they'd later regret. A text-messaging decline? If today's young adults' taste for text messaging persists as they age, this could spell big changes for how wireless carriers do business in the future. Pew notes that voice calls and texting -- the two main services conducted over cell phone carriers' basic networks, rather than their data networks, for which they typically charge extra -- appear to have plateaued in the U.S. ""Both text messaging and phone calling on cell phones have leveled off for the adult population as a whole,"" said the report. ""Text messaging users send or receive an average of 41.5 messages on a typical day, with the median user sending or receiving 10 texts daily -- both figures are largely unchanged from what we reported in 2010. Similarly, cell owners make or receive an average of 12 calls on their cells per day, which is unchanged from 2010."" A plateau -- or even an eventual decline -- in the popularity of both voice calls and text messages could profoundly change how carriers charge for voice calls and text messaging in coming years. In the long term, this might even lead some wireless carriers to abandon the direct telephony business or to treat it as a specialized service. Right now, voice calling and text messaging packages are primary revenue sources for wireless carriers. These services are provided to virtually every cell phone, including the 65% of U.S. mobile phones that are not smartphones and so don't necessarily include data plans at this time. Internet calling . But there are many options for placing voice calls over the Internet (Skype, Google Voice, Vonage and more) using voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) technology. These services generally are not tied to a particular device, so you can access your VOIP account from your computer, tablet or phone -- or even a shared device. VOIP calling systems tend to be more complex for consumers to set up, learn and use than simply dialing a phone number to make a regular phone call. They also can be quirkier or less reliable than standard phone calls. But in coming years, these services probably will become more user-friendly for typical non-tech-savvy U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, more U.S. consumers are buying smartphones that can run apps for VOIP calling services. By late 2012 or early 2013, over half of the cell phones in use in the U.S. will probably be smartphones. Also, many of the remaining feature phones on the U.S. market are becoming considerably ""smarter,"" with greater capabilities to handle more advanced internet-based services -- perhaps even VOIP calling. SMS text messaging also has ample competition from the various popular Internet-based instant messaging services such as AOL IM, Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk and more. BlackBerry Messenger is another SMS alternative popular users of BlackBerry phones. But the catch with alternative instant messaging services is that each one is a closed system. For instance, you can't directly send an instant message to BlackBerry Messenger from Google Talk. While instant messaging remains such a fragmented communication landscape, SMS (which bridges all phone types and carrier networks) retains a significant advantage. You can use that one mobile tool to communicate with whoever you want, as long as you have their cell phone number, and they don't need to be logged in to a site or service at that time to receive your message. Confusion for users . Still, Pew's research hints that the standard U.S. wireless telephony market might be starting a long-term decline. It's conceivable that U.S. wireless carriers may eventually shift to mainly selling data, rather than telephony. This could mean that someday, standard cell phone calls and text messages might be sold as special add-on services, perhaps handled by separate divisions or companies for extra fees. What might that mean for mobile phone users? Probably a lot more confusion and frustration while the shift sorts out. It would take a few years at least before a communication system based mostly on the Internet and wireless data becomes as coherent and simple as the national telephone system most Americans grew up with. Consumers may eventually see cost savings or service improvements associated with more freedom to choose how they make voice calls or send text messages, but this probably wouldn't be an easy change for most people to make.

"(Parenting.com) -- In a new policy statement published in the April 2011 issue of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics now advises parents to keep toddlers in rear-facing car seats until age 2, or until they exceed the height or weight limit for the car seat, which can be found on the back of the seat. Previously, the AAP advised parents to keep kids rear-facing as long as possible, up to the maximum limit of the car seat, and this has not changed. But it also cited one year and 20 pounds as the minimum for flipping the seat, which many parents and pediatricians interpreted as conventional wisdom on the best time to make the switch. The new policy clarifies the AAP's recommendation, making age 2 the new guideline -- a real game-changer for parents of toddlers. A 2007 study in the journal Injury Prevention found that children under age 2 are 75 percent less likely to die or to be severely injured in a crash if they are rear-facing. Another study found riding rear-facing to be five times safer than forward-facing. ""A rear-facing child safety seat does a better job of supporting the head, neck and spine of infants and toddlers in a crash, because it distributes the force of the collision over the entire body,"" said Dennis Durbin, M.D., F.A.A.P., a pediatric emergency physician and co-scientific director of the Center for Injury Research and Prevention at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and lead author of the policy statement and accompanying technical report. Recall Finder: Check if your child's car seat has been recalled . Parenting talked to Ben Hoffman, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and a child passenger safety technician, to get answers to parents' most pressing questions about the new policy. Although the new baseline is now age 2, the AAP has advised parents since 2002 to keep kids rear-facing until they reach the height or weight limit of their car seat. Why are parents so eager to turn their car seats? ""Parents are interested in milestones, and the minimum of one year and 20 pounds has been interpreted as gold standard instead of the minimum,"" says Hoffman. ""Parents are always looking for the next stage of development because in every other scenario, that's a good thing. With car safety seats, however, that's often not the case."" But isn't forward-facing easier for everyone? Yes, it's easier to interact with your child when she is facing forward, and less awkward to get her into the seat. But safety should be the main concern. ""I would ask parents to consider the protection of the child in addition to comfort,"" says Hoffman. ""It's minimally acceptable to change to forward-facing at a year, but parents can do better than that."" New infant and convertible car seats to keep your child safe . What about squished legs? Kids who have been only rear-faced will most likely not be bothered, since they don't know anything else. And it's completely fine for their feet to touch the seat back, or for their legs to bend. ""Once you make the switch, it's hard to go back, so try not to ever switch them before they are ready,"" says Hoffman. Why are so few parents aware of even the older guidelines that say kids should stay rear-facing as long as possible? There may have been some confusion with the message, with many parents mistaking the minimum for the ideal age to make the switch. The AAP hopes that by making age 2 the new guideline, the message will be less confusing for parents and for pediatricians. If my child turns 2 before he reaches the height or weight limit for the seat, should I keep him rear-facing? Yes. The safest decision is to keep him rear-facing until he reaches the height or weight limit for the seat. 10 Car Seat Mistakes You May Be Making . If my child reaches the height or weight limit for my seat before age 2, what should I do? Once your child exceeds the height and weight limit of his infant car seat, purchase a convertible car seat with a higher height or weight limit (most go to 35 pounds rear-facing) and continue to use it rear-facing until age two, or until your child hits the height or weight limit for rear-facing use. At that point you can make the switch to forward-facing-- or you can purchase a convertible car seat with a higher weight limit for rear-facing (some go up to 45 pounds). ""That's a very personal decision for the parent,"" says Hoffman, one that may also be influenced by the size of your car, the arrival of a younger sibling, or your budget. What should I do if I've already switched my under-2 child for forward-facing? The best advice is for parents to consider switching their child back to rear-facing. But the next best thing is to, at a minimum, make sure you correctly use the seat you have: Make sure the seat is harnessed tightly to the vehicle, that the harness is snug over the child and the chest clip is in the correct position, and that the seatbelt or LATCH system are installed correctly. Why didn't my pediatrician tell me about this? ""Pediatricians should be talking about this,"" says Hoffman. ""But given everything else that needs to happen in a well-child visit, sometimes this message gets left behind. I would love to see a day where every family-care health provider knew the best possible advice and shared it with their patients."" Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!!

"(CNN) -- Princess Cruises' Caribbean Princess docked early Friday in Houston, ending passengers' vacations a day early amid an outbreak of norovirus. Princess Cruises spokeswoman Julie Benson says the early docking came because of forecasts predicting heavy fog in Houston, not because of the illness. But, she said a total of 178 people reported the illness during the voyage, and lab tests confirmed that it was norovirus. It's the second outbreak of norovirus on a cruise ship this week. Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas docked in New Jersey on Wednesday, two days earlier than expected. Nearly 700 crew and passengers fell ill on that ship, the highest number of sick people reported on any cruise ship in two decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Friday, the CDC confirmed that illness was also norovirus. What is norovirus? Norovirus is a group of related viruses that belong to the Caliciviridae family. People ingest the infectious virions, which grow in the small intestine before being expelled in feces. It's the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis -- often called a stomach bug -- in the United States, according to the CDC. It causes 19 million to 21 million illnesses every year, most often in crowded environments such as nursing homes, day care centers and, yes, cruise ships. There were nine outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses on cruise ships last year, 16 in 2012 and 14 in both 2011 and 2010, according to the CDC. Norovirus used to be called Norwalk Virus or the Norwalk-like virus. What are the symptoms? Norovirus causes inflammation in the stomach and intestines, leading to stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea. These symptoms typically last one to three days. Other symptoms include a fever, headache and body aches, according to the CDC. Frequent diarrhea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, another serious side effect of the virus. People who are dehydrated may not urinate as much, feel dizzy and have a dry mouth or throat. How is it different from the flu? People with these symptoms may believe they have food poisoning or the stomach flu. You can get norovirus from eating infected food, so that would be considered food poisoning. In fact, norovirus is the most common cause of food-borne disease outbreaks in the United States, according to the CDC. But norovirus is not the flu. The flu is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. How do you catch it? Norovirus is highly contagious. It's a hardy little bug that can live in the environment for up to four weeks. The virus can live in an infected person's stool for two weeks or more. People who come into contact with a surface a patient has touched or clothes they've worn can get sick. You can also get sick eating any food a person with the virus has touched. Food commonly involved in outbreaks includes shellfish, leafy greens and fresh fruit. Any food served raw or handled by an infected person after being cooked can get contaminated. Food can also be easily contaminated if it has been sitting out for hours, such as on a buffet. People who have norovirus are most contagious when they are sick but can still transfer the virus even three days after they have recovered from the worst of the symptoms. How do you treat it? There is no medicine or vaccine to specifically treat norovirus, but most people recover fully without treatment. (There is a vaccine in the early testing stages.) Since this is a virus, antibiotics won't cut it; they work only on bacterial infections. Someone with norovirus has only one option, and that's hydration therapy. People who vomit frequently or have diarrhea need to replace the liquids they lose. Sports drinks can help with mild dehydration, but water is best. You can also buy oral rehydration fluids over the counter at most drug and grocery stores. Getting too dehydrated is dangerous. In extreme cases, people who do not get enough fluids may have to be hospitalized. There, a patient will get fluids intravenously. Will it kill me? Most people will recover fully from norovirus, but it can become serious or even fatal in some patients, such as infants or the elderly. Norovirus can be caught any time, but it's most common in the winter. Each year, the virus leads to approximately 1.8 million doctor visits and 400,000 emergency room visits; most of these patients are children. Young children and the elderly are more likely to be seriously affected by norovirus. An estimated 570 to 800 deaths are caused by the virus each year, though there are generally more in years when a new strain is going around. This happened in the winters of 2002-03 and 2006-07, according to the CDC. How can I protect myself? Do not share food or utensils with people who are sick. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, especially before preparing or handling food and after using the toilet. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer doesn't kill norovirus and should not be a substitute for old-fashioned soap and water. If someone around you is sick, be sure to wipe down any surfaces they touch with a diluted bleach solution. Pay particular attention to cleaning the bathroom area. Wipe around the toilet, door handles and light switches. Also make sure to wash an infected person's clothes thoroughly. If someone gets sick in bed, change their linens and towels immediately.","Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the U.S.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A fugitive South Korean soldier suspected of killing five members of his unit has been captured after he shot himself, bringing an end to a tense standoff. The enlisted soldier suffered heavy bleeding after shooting himself in his side below his left shoulder, the Defense Ministry said. He underwent surgery for his injuries, which are not life-threatening, according to authorities. The military had surrounded the soldier, identified as Sgt. Lim, in northeastern Gangwon province, and exchanged gunfire with him on Sunday. Lim, who was three months from the end of his compulsory military service, is accused of shooting and throwing a grenade at his fellow soldiers on Saturday at a base in a remote area near the heavily fortified border with North Korea. He had been categorized as a soldier in need of special attention, according to the Defense Ministry. In March 2013, he was classed in category A, for soldiers showing signs of possibly committing suicide or causing accidents. But he was later changed to category B, for soldiers who with the help of others can carry out normal military life. Pleas for surrender . Authorities said he used a K2, a semiautomatic rifle that is a standard South Korean army weapon. It is similar to the U.S. military's standard weapon, the M16. The military had been in contact with Lim, repeatedly asking him to surrender, said Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok. On Monday morning, he spoke to his father on a phone provided to him by a military officer. His father and older brother later arrived at the scene of the standoff and continued efforts to persuade him to hand himself in, Kim said. But Lim didn't comply and shot himself with his rifle. He now faces investigation by military authorities. Lim left a note before his apparent suicide attempt, apologizing to the victims and their families, Kim said. There have been previous cases of South Korean military service members going on shooting rampages, in 2005 and 2011. The base where he was serving is in an isolated area and carries out around-the-clock surveillance for any movements by North Korea, said Park Soo-geun, a former South Korean military intelligence official. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Will Ripley contributed to this report.","NEW: The soldier's life is not in danger after he underwent surgery, officials say .

"Although you may think that bottled water is a safer option than tap, two new reports show that the store-bought stuff is actually less regulated than the water you get out of your faucet for free. What's in your water? You may be hard pressed to find out, reports the Environmental Working Group. The Food and Drug Administration has little authority to regulate bottled brands, according to a U.S. Congressional report released recently. While municipal water utilities are required to provide public reports of test results, bottled-water makers are not. (On the other hand, well water, which is found in many rural areas, isn't regulated as water provided by towns and cities is.) So although you may fork over a pretty penny for bottled water, that doesn't mean it's any better than what's coming out of your faucet. In fact, it could be worse and you'd never know it. The new research is backed by a second report from the Environmental Working Group. The nonprofit advocacy organization surveyed the labels and Web sites of nearly 200 popular bottled-water brands and found that less than 2 percent disclosed three important facts that can affect safety: the water's source, purification methods, and chemical pollutants in each bottle. (See the full report on bottled water at EWG's Web site.) ""We're really pushing for a consumer's right to know what's in their water,"" says Nneka Leiba, an environmental health researcher at the EWG. ""This isn't a doomsday scenario. It isn't that the claims are false; it's just that they are misleading."" Reaching for the most popular bottled brands isn't necessarily a solution. In fact, the EWG report found that some of the best-known brands -- for example Whole Foods and San Pellegrino -- are the least likely to report where the water comes from and what it contains. Health.com: Plastic recycling gets easier . ""This probably has to do with the fact that they're imported, so the regulations are different,"" says Leiba. ""Some of the brands you think wouldn't be as transparent, like Walgreens or Sam's Club, scored higher than many of the popular brands."" So what's a safety-conscious shopper to do? In recent years, some reports have suggested that tap water could be contaminated by trace amounts of pharmaceuticals or other substances. Health.com: Why caffeine and sugar are poor substitutes for sleep . Leiba says that activated carbon water filters -- like Brita pitchers or faucet attachments -- are a safe and affordable option for filtering tap water. If families can afford it, she recommends a reverse osmosis filter, which will eliminate all impurities. These reports come as food safety concerns seem to be at an all-time high. Lately, recalls of spinach, sprouts, peanut butter, and, most recently, cookie dough have made many consumers start to question the safety of the items they find on grocery-store shelves. Unlike tap water suppliers, bottled water companies don't have to have their water tested by a certified laboratory, and they aren't required to notify customers within 24 hours if they find elevated levels of contaminants. The FDA does require bottled water companies to test for contaminants and other problems, says Joshua Sharfstein, M.D., the agency's principal deputy commissioner. Health.com: Could your rug make you sick? If the companies fail, however, the public doesn't get to see the actual test results. ""There's clearly a difference in disclosure between municipal water and bottled water, but the FDA's laws focus on safety of food more than on disclosure of information,"" says Sharfstein. ""It's not a question of whether the FDA can do more; it's whether the government can do more through the food safety bill."" Only changes in the current regulations would make it mandatory for manufacturers to make those kinds of records public, he says. Those regulations may change with the Food Safety Enhancement Act. Health.com: Drink this tea to lose that belly . The proposed Food Safety Enhancement Act covers many aspects of food safety, including better preventive control measures by food manufacturers, more frequent inspections of facilities, and greater FDA authority over food recalls.

"(CNN) -- It was deja vu for the Williams sisters at the French Open -- but not in a good way. A mouthwatering third-round clash between seven-time grand slam champion Venus and 17-time major winner Serena was ruled out when the former lost to unseeded Slovakian Anna Schmiedlova 2-6 6-3 6-4 in early play in Paris on Wednesday. Then hours later, Serena -- also the defending champion and world No. 1 -- fell to Spain's Garbine Muguruza 6-2 6-2, her worst ever grand slam performance. In 2008, the siblings were also defeated on the same day at Roland Garros, their least productive major. The last time it happened was at Wimbledon in 2011. An 18th grand slam singles crown for Serena would have tied her with legends Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova but the younger of the tennis playing sisters has now been upset in consecutive majors. Venus has been hindered by debilitating autoimmune disease Sjogren's Syndrome in recent years though she looked solid in her first round match against the promising Swiss, Belinda Bencic. The siblings join other big names who've already been upset at the tournament, including Australian Open champions Stan Wawrinka and Li Na, as well as Kei Nishikori and Caroline Wozniacki. Defeat for Serena meant it was the first time in the Open era that the top two women's seeds had fallen before the third round. ""I don't think anything worked for me today,"" a dejected Serena told reporters at her post-match press conference. ""It was one of those days. You can't be on every day, and, gosh, I hate to be off during a grand slam but it happens. It's not the end of the world. ""I think she played really well and she played really smart. It's great because I'm going to go home and work five times as hard to make sure I never lose again. ""I feel like I don't have to win another match, I don't have to win another tournament. Everything and every day is a bonus for me. ""Obviously I want to do the best and I want to win and I want to be the best and that's my whole goal. But it's great sometimes to get knocked down because you have to get back up. I love getting back up. I love the challenge."" As for Muguruza, the 20-year-old played with precision and power, securing the biggest victory of her career to date with barely a hint of nerves. ""(Serena) said that if I continue playing like this, I can win the tournament. I said, 'I will try, I will try,'"" Muguruza explained of her chat with her opponent at the net upon victory. ""I really didn't expect that but I'm really happy. I had to be aggressive and I did it well. Serena is a great champion but today is a great day for me."" There were no such problems for the No. 3 seed from Poland, Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat Czech Karolina Pliskova. Maria Sharapova -- the No. 7 seed from Russia -- disposed of Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 7-5 6-2 . Angelique Kerber, the eighth seed from Germany, edged past American Varvara Lepchenko 6-2 7-5 while the 2011 U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur, from Australia, beat Austria's Yvonne Meusburger. The No. 12 seed, Flavia Pennetta from Italy, was knocked out by Sweden's Johanna Larsson while there were also wins for Eugenie Bouchard, the 18th seed from Canada, and Spain's 14th seed Carla Suarez Navarro. The top of the men's draw didn't see any such turmoil, and two of the favorites enjoyed straight sets victories on Wednesday. Novak Djokovic, the No. 2 seed from Serbia, breezed past France's Jeremy Chardy 6-1 6-4 6-2 in just over 90 minutes. Djokovic is looking for his first French Open title and will now face Crotia's Marin Cilic. Roger Federer, the 2009 champion, was also in cruise control as he dispatched Argentina's Diego Sebastian Schwartzman 6-3 6-4 6-4. The No. 4 seed will face Russia's Dmitry Tursunov in round three. Both players sympathized with Stan Wawrinka, the Australian Open champion who was knocked out in the opening round by Spanish outsider Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. ""I understand what Wawrinka is going through. In 2008 when I won my first grand slam, I know how that period went after that,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""It's the first time that you have to encounter pressure or expectations of being a favorite in grand slams."" Federer also had some kind words for his compatriot, and said he was confident this would only prove a blip in his career. ""With Stan, I understand where he is, because I was in such a position at a moment in my career, and it's not even the pressure itself. I think it's how you look at yourself and at your game,"" the Swiss told reporters. ""Without changing everything, this is what he's got to work on and solve this, fix this. Little by little. It will not happen overnight. ""But with Australia, with the Monte Carlo Masters, it's in his pocket already. Nobody can take this from him. It will give him time."" Elsewhere on Wednesday, there were wins for the Czech No. 6 seed Tomas Berdych, Milos Raonic, seeded 8 from Canada, and France's No. 13 seed Jo Wilfried Tsonga.

"(CNN) -- The film ""Blackfish"" compellingly describes many of the reasons why keeping orcas in captivity is -- and always has been -- a bad idea. The main premise of the film is that these large, intelligent, social predators are dangerous to their trainers. But orcas are also directly harmed by being confined in concrete tanks and the science is growing to support this common sense conclusion. The latest data show that orcas are more than three times as likely to die at any age in captivity as they are in the wild. This translates into a shorter life span and is probably the result of several factors. First, orcas in captivity are out of shape; they are the equivalent of couch potatoes, as the largest orca tank in the world is less than one ten-thousandth of one percent (0.0001%) the size of the smallest home range of wild orcas. Second, they are in artificial and often incompatible social groups. This contributes to chronic stress, which can depress the immune system and leave captive orcas susceptible to infections they would normally fight off in the wild. Third, they often break their teeth chewing compulsively on metal gates. These broken teeth, even drilled and cleaned regularly by irrigation, are clear routes for bacteria to enter the bloodstream. These are the obvious factors; there are almost certainly others contributing to the elevated mortality seen in captivity. These factors boil down simply to this: Captivity kills orcas. Yes, they may survive for years entertaining audiences, but eventually the stressors of captivity catch up to them. Very few captive orcas make it to midlife (approximately 30 years for males and 45 for females) and not one out of more than 200 held in captivity has ever come close to old age (60 for males, 80 for females). Most captive orcas die while they are still very young by wild orca standards. There is a win/win solution to both the trainer safety and orca welfare dilemmas facing marine theme parks around the world, including SeaWorld in the United States. These facilities can work with experts around the world to create sanctuaries where captive orcas can be rehabilitated and retired. These sanctuaries would be sea pens or netted-off bays or coves, in temperate to cold water natural habitat. They would offer the animals respite from performing and the constant exposure to a parade of strangers (an entirely unnatural situation for a species whose social groupings are based on family ties and stability -- ""strangers"" essentially do not exist in orca society). Incompatible animals would not be forced to cohabit the same enclosures and family groups would be preserved. Show business trainers would no longer be necessary. Expert caretakers would continue to train retired whales for veterinary procedures, but would not get in the water and would remain at a safe distance (this is known in zoo parlance as ""protected contact""). And the degree to which they interact directly with the whales would be each whale's choice. A fundamental premise of these sanctuaries, however, is that eventually they would empty. Breeding would not be allowed and captive orcas would no longer exist within the next few decades. Many wildlife sanctuaries, for circus, roadside zoo and backyard refugees, exist around the globe for animals such as big cats, elephants and chimpanzees. The business (usually nonprofit) model for these types of facilities is therefore well-established for terrestrial species and can be adapted for orcas. Wildlife sanctuaries are sometimes open to the public, although public interaction with the animals is usually minimized. A visitor's center can offer education, real-time remote viewing of the animals, a gift shop, and in the case of whales and dolphins can even be a base for responsible whale watching if the sanctuary is in a suitable location for that activity. Marine theme parks do not need to lose out financially by phasing out orca shows; this is a transformative proposal, not a punitive one. Creating a whale or dolphin sanctuary is not entirely theoretical. Merlin Entertainments is pursuing the establishment of the world's first bottlenose dolphin sanctuary with Whale and Dolphin Conservation), a nonprofit environmental group. Whale and Dolphin Conservation put together a team to determine the feasibility of such a concept and the company has now identified potential sites and is studying the infrastructure that will be needed to support a group of retired dolphins. Before the tragic death of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010, the ethical arguments against keeping orcas in captivity came largely from the animal welfare/animal rights community, with the marine theme parks basically ignoring or dismissing their opponents as a vocal and out-of-touch minority. Now even staunch SeaWorld supporters are wondering if the time has come to think outside the (concrete) box. Furthermore, the marine mammal science community, which has long maintained a neutral stance on the question of whether orcas are a suitable species for captive display, has finally recognized the need to engage. An informal panel discussion on captive orcas is scheduled at the 20th Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals in December, the first time this topic will be openly addressed by the world's largest marine mammal science society. The first orca was put on public display in 1964. The debate on whether that was a good idea -- for people or the whales -- began the next day but didn't really heat up until the 1970s. It raged mostly on the fringe for the next 25 years. It picked up steam in the mid-1990s, with the release of the film ""Free Willy"" and the rehabilitation of its orca star Keiko. And now, thanks in part to ""Blackfish,"" it is mainstream and consensus is building that orcas don't belong in captivity. The marine theme parks can shift with the paradigm or be left behind -- it is up to them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Naomi A. Rose.","Naomi A.

"(CNN) -- There was an important kernel of truth buried in director Spike Lee's recent tirade against gentrification. New York City, like other big cities, has experienced a decades-long economic squeeze in which the cost of housing has soared while wage levels dropped, leaving middle-class families feeling pinched, punished and pushed out. Lee's 10-minute, obscenity-laced rant about changes in his old Brooklyn neighborhood, Fort Greene, was deliberately offensive and, at times, incendiary (you can listen to it -- uncut -- here). He accused white newcomers to the area of being rude and disrespectful of local culture. And in this defense of Fort Greene, he sounds somewhat neighborly -- New York could always use a few more polite people -- until you think about it for a minute. Who, exactly, determines what the local culture is? To whom is this deference or ""respect"" supposed to be rendered, and how? When can the ""respect"" bill be considered paid in full? And whatever happened to the idea that law-abiding citizens in a free society should be able to walk their dogs in the park, take yoga classes, sip overpriced coffee at the local cafÃ© and otherwise go about their business without having their lifestyle choices judged, ridiculed or attacked? Also, as I've noted elsewhere, it doesn't help Lee's case that he sold his own home for $1 million in the late 1990s and decamped to the wealthy Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he currently resides in a 9,000-square-foot palace that he bought in 2006 for $16 million and recently put on the market with a $32 million asking price. This is a man who made a fortune by promoting the hipness of black Brooklyn, relentlessly and profitably spurring on the very gentrification he now decries. There was a better point Lee could've made. The real phenomenon of gentrification worth talking about is a national crisis of housing costs that are climbing faster than the earning power of many residents. It's not confined to black neighborhoods, and it's happening all around the country, not just in New York. In a fascinating report, Daniel Hartley, a research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, examined metropolitan areas to measure the number of census tracts where the housing prices moved from the lower half to the top half for that area. Between 2000 and 2007, Hartley found, housing prices made that leap in 61% of Boston -- the most spectacular increase of any big city. Seattle ranked second, with 55% of the city's census tracts with low-cost housing moving into the pricier bracket. New York, came in third, with 46% of the city's cheaper housing turning not so cheap. Hartley's price-based measurement of gentrification makes far more sense than racially charged anecdotal observations from Lee. Looking at these kinds of hard numbers also reveals that, in many cities, gentrification takes place without an ethnic shift. It's middle-class black homesteaders who are gentrifying the Bronzeville section of Chicago, for example. And South Boston is going upscale while remaining an Irish-Catholic bastion. What makes gentrification a problem is that earning power for most people isn't keeping up with the rising cost of buying or renting a place to live. In New York, the cost of renting an apartment jumped 8.6% between 2007 and 2011 -- and in those same years, median household income dropped nearly 7%, according to a report by New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate. That gap between income and rent is the true crisis of gentrification -- and to fix it will require going beyond ethnic and racial finger-pointing. What we need is a national campaign to ensure that middle-class wages keep pace with the cost of necessities like food, health care and shelter. It won't make headlines like Spike's rant, but it might replace the heat of blame and resentment with the light of solutions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Errol Louis: Spike Lee railed against gentrification in his old neighborhood .

"(CNN) -- Australian researchers released an audio recording Wednesday of an underwater sound that they say could possibly be related to the final moments of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. It's a long shot, but researchers at Curtin University near Perth, Australia, have been studying records from underwater listening devices, including those meant to monitor for signs of underwater nuclear explosions, in an effort to help find the missing plane. ""One signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash,"" said Alec Duncan with the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST). Researchers have been analyzing the very low frequency sound for weeks to see if it was ""the impact of the aircraft on the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank,"" Duncan said. ""But (the source of the noise) is just as likely to be a natural event."" Low frequency signals can travel thousands of miles through water under favorable circumstances, at about 1 mile per second, Duncan said. But ""at the moment (the sound) appears to be inconsistent with other data about the aircraft position,"" he said. That's because researchers at Curtin University believe the sound came from an area thousands of miles to the northwest of the current search area in the southern Indian Ocean. And even then, they haven't been able to pinpoint the source. Duncan says his team has calculated an ""uncertainty box"" for the signal's origin. It's area that stretches some 2,485 miles in length from southeast to northwest across the Indian Ocean, and spans some 124 to 186 miles in width at its widest point. The center of the long, narrow box is south of the tip of India, as shown in a map released Wednesday. The university on Wednesday released an audio clip captured by one of the listening devices, off of Perth. Duncan says his team has sped up the recording 10 times to make it audible to the human ear. It also shared charts of acoustic signal plots showing what various devices detected. Searching in the right place? The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight continues to focus along an arc hundreds of kilometers long, the area where investigators believe the Boeing 777 ran out of fuel, about 1,000 miles off the coast of Western Australia. Martin Dolan, the chief commissioner with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the organization leading the search into MH370 at the request of Malaysia, says an international team of experts continues to review the analysis of Inmarsat satellite data and aircraft performance. In a television exclusive, Dolan told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" he remains confident the final resting place of MH370 is somewhere along that arc, the so-called ""partial handshake"" with the satellite: . ""We've seen all the data. We've seen all the calculations. We are reviewing the calculations and are also developing our own model to cross check and verify that information,"" Dolan told Burnett. When asked last week about the underwater sound being analyzed by the team at Curtin University, along with Geoscience Australia, a government agency, Dolan was skeptical. ""We think that those detections may have been interesting from the point of view of the direction they came, but other characteristics make it unlikely that they are associated with MH370,"" he said. The ATSB first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on May 26. Listening below the surface . As was the case with the Inmarsat satellite -- a communications satellite whose data was analyzed by Malaysia Airlines MH370 investigators as a navigational aide -- the analysis of the underwater signals involves the use of technology for a different purpose than its original intent. One of the devices, operated by Curtin University and located some 12 miles off Perth, is designed to listen to whales and other marine life. The other is for signs of underwater nuclear explosions, one of 11 operated worldwide by the U.N.-chartered Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as part of the International Monitoring System. Early in the search for Malaysia Flight 370, the United Nations reported it had not detected any explosions or plane crashes on land or water from its sensors around the globe. But the recent efforts involve pairing CTBTO data with other sources to see what can be gleaned, officials said. ""One can always be hopeful,"" said Mark Prior, a seismic acoustic analyst with the CTBTO. The CTBTO's hydro-acoustic stations detect low frequency sound in the 0-100 Hz range, and can't detect black box ""pings"" in the 30-40 kHz range, officials said. ""It's possible (to detect a plane crash), but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular,"" said Prior. Prior said some of those circumstances might include a sloping sea bed. Another possible scenario: the origin of the sound would need to be near the listening device. The CTBTO's system near Cape Leeuwin, the southwestern-most point of Australia, regularly captures signals of ice breaking noise from Antarctica and seismic activity from Indonesia, he said. ""There are other scenarios that would allow (the hydrophones to detect a crash). But it's not certain if there was an impact we would detect it,"" Prior said. Attempts were made following the 2009 crash of Air France 447 in the southern Atlantic Ocean to see if underwater listening devices had detected the plane's impact. No data could be found. Years later, after the plane was located, CTBTO again checked its data, and still was not able to identify signals related to the crash.","An Australian university releases an audio clip and other information .

"(CNN) -- It can happen to anybody -- forgetting your glasses are on the top of your head, or not remembering a loved one's birthday after celebrating it for decades. Most of us simply laugh off these short memory lapses. But for a former professional football player, memory lapses can be a scary thing. They can be a sign of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a disease that has been found in the brains of many athletes who suffered repeated hits to the head during their career. Quarterback Brett Favre played 321 straight games in the National Football League before retiring. He recently told Sports Talk 570 in Washington that he can't remember his daughter participating in youth soccer one summer, even though she played several games. That, and other memory lapses, have worried him. ""For the first time in 44 years, that put a little fear in me,"" he said. ""God only knows the toll."" Favre discusses impact concussions have had on his life . The only way to diagnose CTE is after death -- by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau. Tau has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players, including Junior Seau, Dave Duerson, Terry Long and Shane Dronett, who all committed suicide. It was also found in the brain of Mike Webster, who died in 2002. Scientists are working to identify some common symptoms of the brain disease in living players. Experts say athletes with CTE often struggle with memory and decision-making. Some exhibit mood and behavior problems such as depression and hopelessness, or violent, explosive behavior. A few show no symptoms at all. ""There is no specific order of changes in CTE; it's on a case-by-case basis,"" Robert Stern, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, told CNN. ""It could be that some people have more initial changes to (brain) areas that are more responsible for mood and aggression and impulse control."" In August, thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the NFL in a lawsuit that put concussions, and their impact on the brain, under the microscope. The deal called for the NFL to pay $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. ""My hope is that any players or ex-players that are suffering, or begin to suffer, from symptoms of dementia, will be taken care of in a respectable manner through this settlement,"" said Chris Dronett, one of the plaintiffs, whose husband Shane Dronett committed suicide in 2009 at age 38. Scientists found evidence of CTE in Shane's brain after his death. At the heart of the lawsuit was plaintiffs' allegations that the NFL led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks. The suit alleged that misinformation, which included studies by the committee suggesting no correlation between concussions and long-term brain damage, trickled down to players so that they did not realize the true risks they were taking while playing. The NFL didn't comment about the settlement, but a league spokesman previously said, ""Any allegation that the league sought to mislead players has no merit ... and stands in contrast to actions it took to better protect players."" In recent years, the NFL has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field and added sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to evaluate more independently injured players. What is most important, said Jamal Anderson, a former player and plaintiff, ""is to bring attention to the plight of thousands of players and the importance of taking concussion and head trauma seriously."" Concussions result from blows to the head, such as when a player collides with another. ""In a football game, when someone takes a hard hit, the helmet does a pretty good job of protecting the skull from getting a skull fracture,"" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and CNN's chief medical correspondent, told Bleacher Report. ""But what is really happening when someone is running down the field and ... they get hit -- the brain keeps moving inside the skull."" It's not so much the hit, although that's important, but the sudden acceleration and deceleration of the brain that causes the concussion, Gupta said. Confusion, nausea, headache and loss of consciousness are some of the immediate symptoms of concussions, but they can also have longer-lasting effects. Severe impacts to the head can lead to bleeding or permanent nerve damage. Research suggests repeated concussions can lead to CTE. High schools tackle football concussions . CNN's Elizabeth Landau, Nadia Kounang and Bleacher Report's Mike Chiari contributed to this story.","Quarterback Brett Favre says memory lapses have worried him .

"(CNN) -- The Florida Department of Health confirmed an increase in the number of cases of dengue fever acquired in the Key West area. New statistics from the department said 24 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Key West through mid-July. Of those, 18 involve Key West residents, five are residents of other Florida counties and one case involves a resident of another state. In addition, 49 so-called ""imported"" cases of dengue fever are reported in Florida. Those cases involved people who had traveled to areas under a dengue endemic, such as the Caribbean or Central and South America. The last time there was a dengue outbreak in Florida was 1934. Dengue is acquired through the bite of certain species of mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti, but also Aedes albopictus, both of which are present in Florida, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Surviving dengue fever: The first known victim of the outbreak . ""We are concerned that if dengue gains a foothold in Key West, it will travel to other Southern cities ... like Miami,"" said Harold Margolis, chief of the dengue branch of the CDC in a press release in July. Dengue is the most common virus transmitted by mosquitoes in the world. It causes as many as 100 million infections and kills 25,000 people every year. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to the World Health Organization. Symptoms appear three to 14 days after the bite of an infected mosquito, according to the Florida Department of Health. They include sudden onset of fever, severe headache, severe pain behind the eyes, muscle, joint and bone pain (giving the disease the nickname ""break-bone fever"") and bleeding. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea may also be present in some cases. Dengue fever symptoms usually last four to seven days. It is often diagnosed incorrectly because the symptoms are similar to influenza and other viruses. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a rare but more severe form of dengue infection that can be fatal if not recognized and treated. The Florida Department of Health encourages people to be proactive against mosquitoes, said Susan Smith of the department. ""Wearing clothing that covers the skin and bug spray with deet are two steps that all Floridians and visitors can take to protect themselves."" There is no vaccine to prevent dengue, but early detection and treatment can reduce the risk of severe illness. Locally acquired dengue outbreaks in the United States are rare. There have been a few confirmed cases along the Texas-Mexico border in recent years. CNN's Lisa McClure contributed to this report.","Number of cases of dengue fever in Key West area increases to 24 .

"(CNN) -- While many visits to Marrakech revolve around the imposing Koutoubia mosque or Jemaa el Fna, the bustling central square filled with snake charmers and storytellers, there's plenty to do beyond these landmarks. For those willing to delve deep into the narrow streets around the square or into the desert and mountains outside the city, Marrakech rewards with stunning scenery, unforgettable flavors and luxurious indulgences. Here are some of the city's highlights. 1. Getting lost in the backstreets . Exploring the old medina can be pleasurable and expensive in equal measures thanks to the small boutiques selling almost everything. Among classic local souvenirs are djellaba robes, spices, babouches (Moroccan slippers), old carpets and colorful ceramics. Bargaining is part of the attraction here. Taking time over a purchase will not only save money but generally prompt an enjoyable discussion with the vendor.

Here, the simple joy of a peaceful garden meets the complicated world of high couture. This 12-acre botanical creation was bequeathed to Marrakech by French painter Jacques Majorelle and later saved from development by fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, who bought it in the 1980s and, following his death, had his ashes scattered among its plants. The garden, which blends Moorish and art deco features, is filled with rare flowers. A startling electric blue villa looks down upon the scene. Jardin Majorelle, Rue Yves Saint Laurent, Marrakech; +212 5243-01894 . 3. Eating a sheep's head . There are plenty of places to eat Moroccan food in Marrakech. Cooked snails, tajines, couscous and sheep heads -- there are different levels of exoticism to match the adventurousness of the diner. Tanjia is a staple here. It's a meat dish cooked for six or more hours in a ceramic pot. It's not commonly enjoyed by tourists but has such a terrific reputation among Moroccans that some come to Marrakech with the sole purpose of eating it.

El Badi Palace: It may be in ruins, but it's still possible to get an idea of the former glory of this sprawling 16th-century sultan's home. There are subterranean rooms and a labyrinth to explore, plus a museum of objects recovered from an old Minbar (pulpit) at the Koutoubia mosque. Mamounia Palace: This five-star hotel has been a Marrakech institution for the best part of a century, receiving famous guests such as Winston Churchill and Charlie Chaplin. The Mamounia still attracts celebrities. Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter was reportedly married here in 2013.

Whether for drinking tea or staying the night, riads are a great part of the Marrakech experience. These traditional Moroccan houses built around a central garden or courtyard are as much a part of the city as the snake charmers of the main square -- although many have had a modern makeover. Regardless of whether they've been kitted out with the latest fixtures or remain faithful to their old fashioned Moroccan decor, they all seem to evoke the myths of ""One Thousand and One Nights.""

One of Marrakech's key attractions is that it lies within easy reach of the Atlas Mountains, meaning that cool retreats from the heat and dust of the city are close at hand. The town of Lalla Takerkoust, 43 kilometers (27 miles) to the southwest, is chiefly known for its nearby dam and lake and is a great place for quad biking, camel riding or simply admiring view of the peaks. The valley of Ourika, in the Atlas foothills 60 kilometers to the south of Marrakech, is a popular escape to see Berber villages surrounded by waterfalls and rivers. The village of Armed, 64 kilometers due south, is the last stop before Toubkal, Morocco's highest mountain, the peak of which affords views over the Sahara. It's a great base for hiking or for simply breathing pure air, contemplating nature or enjoying a lunch on the terrace at the Roches Hotel (+212 667 64 49 15) 8. Grabbing a bargain in Bab El Khemis . It's off the main tourist trail, but Bab el Khemis is worth a visit. The souk here is open every day, but on Thursdays (""Khemis"" translates as ""Thursday"") it becomes a truly Moroccan experience. This is when it transforms into a crowded flea market selling secondhand goods and treasures such as vintage carpets, doors and more than a few things that customers probably don't know exist until they stumble across them here. 9. Hot air ballooning . When people visit the city and talk of getting high, it doesn't necessarily mean they're hunting for the Crosby, Stills and Nash ""Marrakech Express"" vibe of the 1960s hippie trail. Over the past 20 years, the city has emerged as a destination for balloon trips -- clear Moroccan skies that rarely see clouds or rain are a huge plus. Taking in what is undoubtedly the best view of the Atlas Mountains doesn't come cheap, but few deny it's money well spent.

During a grueling 14-day expedition through the ice-strewn Arctic, our seven-man team faced challenges that not even the intense training we went through beforehand could prepare us for. It is one thing being told what the Arctic is like: seeing it and living it firsthand is quite another. The only one among us with adventure experience was Bear Grylls, our unflappable expedition leader, but by the time we finished we all felt like hardened veterans. From our start point in Pond Inlet, to the pride and relief of reaching Darnley Bay a fortnight later, the journey covered 5700 nautical miles. And if you're imagining us in an ice-breaking ship, think again. This was all done in a rigid inflatable boat, making us the first crew ever to navigate the Passage in such a vessel. As if creating that piece of Arctic history wasn't a thrilling enough prospect, the encounters the journey threw up -- from rescuing a fellow explorer (and his dog) from an ice choke, to stumbling across the possible remains of legendary Arctic explorer Captain Franklin -- made the expedition truly unforgettable. Both those incidents, however, were reminders that in the excitement and adrenaline of adventure, it is easy to forget the all-too-real dangers that the Passage has for centuries presented to those who take it on. Ice chokes, growlers (floating icebergs) and freezing winds during the day, and turbulent seas when night fell (with a member of a team knocked unconscious during a particularly heavy storm) served as a constant reminder that we were very much at the mercy of the environment. Standing guard with a shotgun during an overnight stop at Ross Point, scanning the horizon for grizzly bears, certainly brought that feeling home for me. Perhaps the most frequent emotion I felt, however, was amazement at seeing up close the reason that brought me to the Arctic in the first place. The expanses of ice-strewn water in the Passage are an incredible sight, but they are also a brutal reminder of the climate change that has so changed this landscape. There is a certain irony that the isolated seas of the Passage, the very outer limits of the populated world, should represent a universal concern for the world as a whole. In embarking on the trip, we each knew the challenges that we would personally confront, but in the shifting ice we saw a vivid metaphor for maybe the biggest challenge facing all of us. It is now almost unanimously acknowledged that industrial development and rapid population growth has modified the environment in which we live, and some of the changes in global climatic conditions are already obvious. Nowhere is this more poignant that the Northwest Passage. Until 30 years ago this series of very deep channels that wind through Canada's Arctic Islands was frozen all year round. In the last few years, however, changing climate has caused the ice to thin and melt, and during the summer months it is now possible to cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 10 years, the legendary Passage could be open sea . This is why Future Capital Partners decided to back the expedition. Whilst raising awareness about the effects of global warming and fundraising for charity, we hoped we were also able to promote the role of businesses in reversing -- or at least slowing down -- the global warming process. Crossing the Northwest Passage you understand why this is just the beginning of what has to be done.","Expedition through Northwest Passage showed declining glaciers .

"(CNN) -- Destructive graffiti wars are being waged by anonymous vandals, deliberately defacing many of the meticulously painted murals that vividly illustrate San Francisco's streets. The attacks have sparked calls by outraged professional artists and their supporters demanding everything from public humiliation to experimental collaboration with the hostile graffiti ""taggers"" to avoid violence and more lost art. If you're going to San Francisco, keep in mind that the outdoor murals you see are ephemeral, so appreciate them -- and take lots of photos -- before they disappear. Countless gorgeous, larger-than-life murals illustrate this city's weathered exteriors, bestowing visual intrigue to homes, shops, parking lots, recreational facilities, derelict buildings and alleys. Artistic themes include anarchy, surrealism, science fiction, eroticism and other fantasies and realities. Some gigantic paintings include political slogans or poetry for the public to ponder. Now, however, a rolling population of taggers has been wreaking havoc on many of the best murals, by hurriedly spray-painting initials, names, words, acronyms and other lettering across the majestic urban displays. Gang intimidation at work . Some victimized artists worry that the taggers may include criminal gangs marking their neighborhoods, making it unwise to confront them or remove their destructive scrawls. ""There is always that possibility of violence, if you approach someone tagging a mural,"" said Carlos Daniel Perez-Boza, 26, who teaches art at San Francisco's Cultural Arts Division of the Recreation and Parks. ""Some taggers come in large numbers, some are gang related. Their intention is to mess things up and possibly look for a fight,"" he said in an interview. ""I can only hope taggers would appreciate the street arts, and truly see what are the possibilities that we are building, for artists to showcase their talents in public space,"" said Perez-Boza, who is also a muralist, painter, street and studio artist. Mission District art targeted . Clarion Alley, the Mission District neighborhood's prestigious, free, open-air gallery, isn't immune from desecration. Since 1992, Clarion Alley's urban lane has allowed artists to voluntarily adorn its outdoor walls, fences, residences, gutters and every other available space with fanciful and often profound murals. The public alley runs parallel between 17th and 18th streets, linking Mission and Valencia streets -- you can visit anytime day or night for free. Prominent artist Mats Stromberg completed his 12-foot-tall, 15-foot-wide, ant-infested ""Giant Selfie"" Clarion Alley mural in 2013. His mural portrays a man's huge turquoise head -- resembling himself -- laying on the ground, ""with two factions of ants battling it out in front of his very eyes, representing the sort of narcissism associated with all the latest social media gadgets, as well as the individual's helplessness in the face of conflicts either nearby or globally,"" he said in an interview. Stromberg wasn't amused when his masterpiece was defaced in July. Big, bold blobs of silver-colored letters, outlined in red -- spelling the name ""Blake"" -- suddenly smothered much of the mural. Asked what punishment anti-mural taggers should suffer, Stromberg suggested perhaps the person should be ""tarred and feathered, and tied to the defaced wall for a few days and nights? Spray-paint their faces?"" Compromising with taggers? Stromberg, whose signature ""Mats!?"" includes double punctuation, has seen his art attacked by other taggers in the past. His previous response was to painstakingly paint over the graffiti, and restore his mural. This time, however, Stromberg painted fresh chaotic designs over parts of the silvery letters, rendering ""Blake"" unrecognizable under blossoming, newly evolved weird images. ""My response this time is to collaborate with my tagger, and not return the piece to its original state, but see what happens,"" said Stromberg, 50, while laboring to repair his mural. ""The tags inspire new visual vocabularies I would not have thought to paint, had the piece not been tagged."" Tagger response: ""Its war"" In August, ""Blake"" returned with a vengeance to Clarion Alley and ominously wrote in black letters across the repaired mural: ""THIS ISNT ART. ITS WAR. BLAKE."" ""I wish you could get ahold of Blake, my tagger-collaborator, but I've no idea who, where, what, he is,"" Stromberg lamented after the fresh assault. Stromberg's Facebook friends analyzed the tagger's motive. ""You could think of it in terms of mental illness. It's Tourette's -- but they have to write their name over and over maybe,"" posted one colleague. ""He is expressing some sort of superiority -- read: 'internalized inferiority' -- over a real artist. I was just marveling at the tags on the toilet seat at a local establishment. How low do you have to be, to want to tag that?"" someone else wrote. ""I really just don't get why he has chosen to target Mats Stromberg of all people. A legendary, grimy, old school Mission dude, underground pioneer,"" another dismayed artist wrote. ""This same stuff has happened to mine as well. It's a bummer, but it is good to keep in mind that anything we put out there into the public is ephemeral, meaning it could last a long time or no time,"" that artist said. ""Stick a nanny cam on there, get a mug shot, and then paint the dude's face on there, wearing a T-shirt that says 'I'm with stupid' and an arrow pointing the guy's head,"" suggested another post. Attack on establishment art . ""I'm guessing they see a legitimate commissioned or permitted works of art, as being part of the establishment,"" said Stromberg. He was referring to the alley's envious status of enshrining some of San Francisco's best art, organized by the volunteer artists' collective Clarion Alley Mural Project (CAMP). ""Sadly, CAMP has helped to contribute to the extreme gentrification of the Mission District over these past two decades,"" wrote artist Megan Wilson, a CAMP ""core organizer"" who defends the alley's roots. ""What started as a neighborhood-based project committed to diversity and inclusion, is now a magnet for lots of folks hoping to profit off of the image that CAMP has created -- from the developers and real estate agents who use CAMP as a selling point for the 'cool, hip Mission experience,' to those who use the space for fashion shoots, to corporations hoping to include the 'gritty urban street art' image to sell their products, to any number of paid tours by folks unrelated to CAMP, spreading misinformation about the project, artists and murals,"" she wrote on her website. No control over taggers . Many of San Francisco's large murals are the result of serious negotiations between artists and wall owners -- including shopkeepers, residents or city officials -- to ensure the painting remains visible and not erased for violating private property. But no one can control malicious taggers. ""I believe taggers will always state their voice,"" said Perez-Boza. ""Whether it's tagging a white wall, a mural, local mom and pop, venues, billboards, public transit or corporate buildings."" People attack murals because ""they knew the artist, and maybe that artist they knew 'sold out.' ""Or they at one point were in the same crew, and now they are in different crews. ""Or jealousy and envy. Or they just don't care. ""Or they can be sending gang messages. ""I don't know what the punishment should be, if someone intentionally spray-painted over a mural. ""It's not like the law is involved, unless you're tagging a McDonald's ad,"" Perez-Boza said, laughing. ""I had someone tag one of my work-in-progress murals. ""The silly part about this was how they displayed it. ""My wall was about 15 feet high, 20 feet wide. Their mark was no bigger then six inches."" You can see some of San Francisco's best murals and other art at websites for the Clarion Alley Mural Project; Carlos Daniel Perez-Boza; Mats Stromberg; SF Mural Arts. Richard S. Ehrlich is a freelance writer from San Francisco. He's reported for international media from Asia since 1978, based in Hong Kong, New Delhi and now Bangkok.","Authorized murals and street art routinely being defaced by vandals in San Francisco .

"(CNN) -- Eugenie Bouchard has already established herself as the new face of women's tennis -- and now she's just two wins away from claiming her maiden grand slam title. The 20-year-old, who is set to move up to No.8 in the world following her 6-3 6-4 win over Germany's Angelique Kerber, will equal the best ever ranking held by a Canadian on the women's tour. Bouchard, who reached the semifinals of both the Australian and French Opens earlier this year, saw off Kerber to set up a semifinal clash with Romania's Simona Halep. World No.3 Halep -- the highest ranked player remaining in the tournament, won the only meeting between the pair Indian Wells earlier in 2014. ""It was definitely a tough battle,"" Bouchard told the tournament's official website following her victory. ""I've played her a few times and it's always been really tough. I knew it wasn't over and I just kept trying to fight. ""I was trying to stay in the moment, I knew I couldn't think ahead, I've been working on that. I hit a good few aggressive shots, so I just tried to play my game."" Halep, who was beaten in the final of the French Open by Maria Sharapova, cruised through to the last four with a straight sets win over Germany's Sabine Lisicki. Romania's Halep, 22, started slowly, losing the first three games before hitting back to take the first set 6-4. And she stormed through the second -- taking it 6-0 after winning 11 consecutive games. ""It was a good match. I had a slower start today and she had 4-1 and then I came back very well,"" Halep told the BBC. ""I was really enjoying myself, it was incredible on Centre Court. It was my second time here and I really enjoy every moment."" Bouchard and Halep will meet on Thursday for the right to play either Lucie Safarova or Petra Kvitova in Saturday's final.","Eugenie Bouchard books place in last four .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger used a short speech at the State Department on Wednesday to joke about the prospect of Hillary Clinton running for President in 2016. Standing on stage with five other former or current secretaries of state, Kissinger -- who served as secretary of state under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford -- highlighted the work of diplomats and foreign service officers as he spoke at the groundbreaking for the United States Diplomacy Center, a museum set to honor diplomatic work. He then, however, dropped a slight joke about the prospect of Clinton running for president. ""We all know that we will never do anything more challenging in our lives than to serve these objectives,"" Kissinger said. ""I would say all of us, except one."" Clinton, who served four years as President Barack Obama's top diplomat, is widely considered the frontrunner for the Democrat's presidential nomination in 2016. She has hinted at thinking about running for the job and has a cadre of groups organizing around the possibility that she runs. Joining Kissinger and Clinton on stage for the groundbreaking were former secretaries James Baker, III, Madeleine Albright, and Colin Powell -- along with current Secretary of State John Kerry. During her short remarks, Clinton heaped praise on her colleagues and told the audience that Kissinger has ""written the book on diplomacy."" While Kissinger's joke was not an obvious joke about Clinton, the former top diplomat has been known to tease his successor about running for president. Shortly after Clinton left the State Department in 2013, Kissinger gave a nod to Clinton 2016 while presenting an award to the former first lady. ""At least four secretaries of state became president,"" Kissinger joked during remarks at the annual Atlantic Council awards dinner in Washington. ""And that sort of started focusing my mind even though there was a constitutional provision that prevented me from doing it. I thought up all kinds of schemes to get around that."" Then, adopting a more serious tone, he continued. ""I want to tell Hillary that when she misses the office, when she looks at the histories of secretaries of state, there might be hope for a fulfilling life afterwards."" Clinton did not directly respond to Kissinger on Wednesday, but did do so in 2013. ""When I became secretary of state, I spent a lot of time thinking about my illustrious predecessors -- not primarily the ones who went on to become president,"" Clinton said to laughter. Kissinger recently told NPR that although Clinton ""would be a good President,"" he would still vote for the Republican nominee. CNN's Mary Grace Lucas contributed to this report.","Kissinger used a short speech on Wednesday to joke about Clinton 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Injury doubt Novak Djokovic has confirmed his participation, new dad Roger Federer is a maybe, but they will go into the Rome Masters next week in the knowledge their old nemesis Rafael Nadal is finding his feet on clay again after some shock recent defeats. Nadal booked his participation in his 90th ATP Tour final with a 6-4 6-3 win over fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut at the Madrid Open Saturday -- always in command in the one hour 43 minute clash. Nadal, who is the defending champion at the Masters 1000 event, lost in the quarterfinals at Monte Carlo and Barcelona to David Ferrrer and Nicolas Almagro to show rare vulnerability on his favorite surface. But bidding for his 27th crown in Masters events, the world number one has looked more comfortable and faces Kei Nishikori  in Sunday's final after the Japanese star won a quite extraordinary match against Ferrer. Nishikori, who won the Barcelona title, saw Ferrer save no less than nine match points before converting his 10th in a 7-6 5-7 6-3 victory in a shade under three hours. Second-ranked Djokovic was due to play in Madrid, but pulled out at the last minute due to the right wrist injury which first hit him in Monte Carlo. The Serbian has been training hard ahead of an early return with the French Open looming and took to social media Saturday to indicate he would be back in the Foro Italico next week. ""Rome her I come!"" tweeted Djokovic, who will be in the same side of the draw as Federer, whose wife Mirka gave birth to a second set of twins, sons Leo and Lenny earlier this week. Federer, who has been showing improved form all year, will definitely play at the second grand slam of the season in Paris later this month, but his participation in Rome is still uncertain. ""Roger plans on playing Roland Garros and he will make a decision at the last minute if he will play Rome depending on how everything is going with his family,"" his agent Roger Godsick told the official ATP Tour website. Meanwhile in the women's WTA tournament in Madrid, Maria Sharapova will play Simona Halep of Romania in Sunday's final. Sharapova, fresh off her Stuttgart success, brushed aside Agnieszka Radwanska to advance to the tile match in Madrid for a second straight year. The Russian built on a fast start and despite a second set rally from Radwanska was a 6-1 6-4 winner. ""It's great to have these results, over No.3 in the world today and yesterday beating Li Na, who is No.2 in the world. These were my goals at the beginning of the season, physically and mentally after a long layoff,"" she said. By contrast, the other semifinal was a close and grueling affair, with Halep eventually prevailing 6-7 6-3 6-2 in two hours 36 minutes against former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. Halep, bidding for her eighth title since last year's Madrid tournament, trailed a set and 3-1 before winning eight straight games to take a stranglehold on the match. Halep is already looking forward to the final. ""Of course, tomorrow will be a very tough match. Maria is a great champion. And she's playing really well here. I will just try to be happy and enjoy being in the final,"" she told the WTA Tour website.","Novak Djokovic to return to ATP tour in Rome after injury .

"(CNN) -- Like the moment that Harry Potter first learned he was a wizard, Raleigh Browne can vividly recall when he first heard of the adventures of the ""Boy Who Lived."" ""It was the summer between my kindergarten and first-grade years when my mom returned home from the bookstore with a copy of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' "" he said. ""She laid the paperback down on our kitchen table and told me that a number of her friends had told her that the 'Harry Potter' books were wonderful stories, and she wanted me to try 'Sorcerer's Stone.' My mom offered to read it aloud to me."" He said he was instantly mesmerized once she started reading it to him. ""After a few more nights of reading with my mom, I could restrain myself no longer, and I picked up the book and began to read it on my own."" He was about to enter first grade, but the Mechanicsville, Virginia, resident soon devoured the first four ""Potter"" books, and a few years later, he made that fateful journey to the bookstore to pick up the final book, ""Deathly Hallows."" He can even remember the number of the reserved copy that the store called for him to pick up: 372. He said the dedication spoke deeply to him, and he recalls reflecting on the series after nine hours of reading the final part of the story. ""These fantastic books have made a profound impact on my life,"" he said. ""These books have shaped the way I think, act and live."" He sees Harry Potter as a friend whom he knows better than some of his real friends, and Dumbledore as a mentor. Browne is one of many iReporters who said that they felt a kinship to Harry Potter, having literally grown up with the character. A lasting friendship . Anna Venckus of Memphis met her best friend, Madeline Trantham, through ""Harry Potter"": ""When we were in third grade, we were hanging out in her room (I was already obsessed with 'Harry Potter'), and I asked her if she'd ever heard of 'Harry Potter.' She said yes, she'd seen a couple of the movies. Somehow I got her to read the books and she began to love it, too. We became so close so quickly -- all because of 'Harry Potter.' "" 'Potter' fans line up for grand adieu . Since then, the pair has seen every movie since ""Order of the Phoenix"" together, and went on Thursday night to see the midnight showing of the final film. She describes their relationship as ""closer than sisters."" ""Her 'altar ego' is Hermione, and mine is Ginny,"" she said. ""Thank You, J.K. Rowling. Because of you, I have the best friend a girl could ask for."" The lessons of 'Potter' For Katie Mahoney, it was an encounter with Rowling that started her on the way to making Harry a significant part of her life. The author was signing books at her elementary school, and her friend got a signed copy of one of the ""Potter"" books, which peaked Mahoney's interest. ""Once I started reading 'The Sorcerer's Stone,"" I couldn't put them down,"" she said. ""I loved that the hero was young and easy to relate to. Harry could be anyone, since he is grounded in the real world, but is then whisked away to the wizarding world."" The West Lafayette, Indiana, resident said she has learned many life lessons from the stories: ""(The books) taught me about right and wrong, and how the ends do not justify the means. The books also taught me about human nature, how your actions can have a significant effect way down the line."" She would greatly anticipate every new installment, going to sites such as Mugglenet.com to find out anything she could about the next book. Now that the books and movies have come to an end, she doesn't see them going away anytime soon. ""Certainly Harry will live on in events like Quidditch, which I don't see slowing down anytime soon. Many colleges have already recognized it as a sport,"" she said. (In fact, she took part in the 2010 Quidditch World Cup in New York.) ""With bands like Draco and the Malfoys, the Whomping Willows, the Parselmouths, the Ministry of Magic and Harry and the Potters, Harry will have a place in music as well."" An 'Army' of friends . Laura Bucklin from Solon, Iowa -- who, at 21, is the same age as Harry Potter would be now -- remembers the moment in 1998 when her friend lent her the first book. ""I've been captivated ever since,"" she said. In high school, she and a group of friends would constantly discuss the books and movies, and dressed up as ""Dumbledore's Army"" during their school's homecoming week. This tradition extended to the openings of each film. ""I love Ron, so I tied up my long hair in a bun and stuffed it under a red wig that my mom and I cut ourselves from a 'Scooby-Doo' Daphne wig,"" she said. She said that she posted an iReport to let her friends know that she was thinking of them when she went to see the final movie since she is doing an internship out of town. More ""Potter"" stories . Inspired by the wizarding world . Dylan Hurwitz remembers being disappointed at age 11 -- soon after he began reading the books -- when an owl didn't arrive to whisk him away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Instead, the books inspired him to create more art. He made a stop-motion animated film of the first book. He drew scenes from the books, or created new scenes he hoped to see in future books. He wrote fan fiction and went on to write his own 200-page fantasy story. ""I would often play the movies on TV and mute it, and watching the action onscreen, improvise new songs,"" he said, adding he's interested in a career in writing musical scores for movies. He said Rowling's rags-to-riches success and the imaginative stories stirred a passion for artistic expression. Whether ""Harry Potter"" influenced art, relationships or simply the pure joy of reading, it's clear the books and movies won't soon be forgotten, especially for those who grew up with them. As Browne put it, "" 'Harry Potter' has defined my generation, and while our 'Harry Potter' era may be drawing to a close, the series will live on forever.""","Many iReporters feel a kinship to Harry Potter, having literally grown up with the character .

"(CNN) -- It was a bad day on the clay for Maria Sharapova as she was bounced out of the Rome Masters by Ana Ivanovic, Thursday. It was the first time anyone other than world No.1 Serena Williams had beaten the Russian on the red stuff since the 2011 French Open. Sharapova had been tuning up for this year's grand slam at Roland Garros in fine fettle, winning tournaments in Stuttgart and Madrid, but Ivanovic stormed to 6-1 6-4 victory to end her run in the third round of the Rome event. ""My energy level today maybe was not the best,"" Sharapova told reporters in Rome. ""But Ana played a really great match, she came out with winners from all over the court and she was the better player. ""This can't take anything away from the last two weeks and I'm quite excited for the week coming up for the grand slam."" Ivanovic, the Serbian 2008 French Open champion, had lost her last seven matches against Sharapova. Australian Open champion Li Na ticked off a 6-3 6-1 win over Sam Stosur while Serena Williams beat fellow American Varvarato Lepchenko to also advance to the last eight. In the men's draw, Tommy Haas claimed a big win over Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka. It was the 36-year-old German's first top-10 win in over a year. Wawrinka, the world No.3, said the upset would make no difference to his preparations for this month's French Open. ""I am not focused on winning the French Open, it's so far away and there are so many players ready to win,"" he said. ""I know if I am ready, feeling good and my level is there to win a lot of matches but I don't expect to win the French Open. ""There's Rafa, you have Novak, Roger is going to be ready and fit. I need to focus on myself, on the draw, and to be ready."" The eight-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal finds himself meeting old rival Andy Murray in the quarterfinals of the Rome Masters. Murray celebrated his 27th birthday with victory over Jurgen Melzer while Nadal cruised past Mikhail Youzhny. The Wimbledon champion revealed low-key birthday celebrations before turning his thoughts to his first meeting with Nadal since 2011. ""I've had two cards and two cakes, but no presents or anything,"" said Murray. ""I'm hoping when I go home there will be some. If there isn't a couple I will be pretty disappointed. ""It won't be a bad thing to play against Nadal. I haven't played him for maybe three years. ""With the French Open and Wimbledon coming up I haven't practiced with him hardly at all either, so I would be quite interested to play against him before to see how his game has changed.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Since the Democrats chose to host their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a state that has not been hospitable to unions, organized labor is going to have a rally to focus attention on its key issues in Philadelphia on August 11. The rally is meant to send a message to the Democratic leadership, as well as to Republicans, that many workers feel as if they don't have a voice in the two-party system. As AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka said to members, the rally will ""give us an opportunity to connect the faces of ordinary Americans to the basic issues affecting working people in our country while providing an important liftoff to our Labor 2012 political program for the fall."" The rally is indicative of a larger tension that has plagued the Democratic coalition for several decades. Since the 1960s, organized labor, once the pillar of the Democratic Party, has often been taken for granted or even treated with hostility. Senate Republicans block DISCLOSE Act for 2nd straight day . Union leaders frequently complain that they have second-class status in the party compared with other groups such as environmentalists or suburban voters. During the battle over public employee unions in Wisconsin, most national Democrats were noticeably absent from the debate. Before the Wisconsin gubernatorial election that followed the recall, President Obama was willing to tweet his support for Gov. Scott Walker's opponent, Tom Barrett, but unwilling to actually visit. This fissure has high costs for the Democrats and for liberalism more generally. Organized labor has been integral to the organizational strength of liberalism throughout the 20th century, as the most reliable and powerful force to get out the vote in elections and to help build congressional coalitions behind progressive legislation. The alliance, which formed when the AFL helped President Woodrow Wilson during the early stages of World War I, flourished during the New Deal. Democrats won the support of workers as a result of the surge of legislation that helped working- and middle-class Americans find economic security. The Wagner Act (1935) cemented this marriage as the federal government legitimated the right of workers to organize in unions. Labor leaders like Sidney Hillman from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, who helped found the CIO, established the first political action committee to help FDR win re-election in 1944. During World War II, most of the major unions were a key part of the homeland effort, assisting the administration as it moved to convert factories to wartime production. In 1948, President Harry Truman would not have won re-election had it not been for organized labor, which in the final weeks of the campaign mobilized its troops to defeat New York Gov. Thomas Dewey. ""Labor did it!"" cried Truman, who won the vote of 89% of the automobile workers, recounted historian Nelson Lichtenstein. Although a Republican was in the White House for most of the 1950s, organized labor helped a growing number of liberal Democrats win office in the House and Senate. They promoted proposals for civil rights and health insurance for the elderly that gradually gained support in the House and Senate. In addition to supporting Lyndon's Johnson's election campaign in 1964, the AFL-CIO, which had formed in 1955 when the two major coalitions of unions decided to merge, proved integral to lobbying for Johnson's domestic proposals. George Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO, and Walter Reuther, the vice president of the AFL-CIO and the head of the United Auto Workers, were regular visitors to the White House, helping Johnson not only with bills directly related to labor but with other parts of his domestic agenda, ranging from the War on Poverty to civil rights. When he feared there were not enough votes among Democrats for the war on poverty, LBJ relied on organized labor to pressure business in Pennsylvania to push liberal Republicans in the state to support the bill. Even Jimmy Carter, who in 1976 ran as an outsider and railed against traditional Democratic interests, depended on unions to bring out the vote and on unionized workers to vote for him in key industrial states for his victory on election day. The relationship between labor and Democrats frayed after the 1970s. One of the reasons was that organized labor simply lost much of its muscle. Membership declined dramatically from the highs of 30% of the work force in the 1950s and the 1960s to a little over 12% today. With fewer members, more Democrats were tempted to look elsewhere to build their electoral muscle. Organized labor also suffered as Democrats reached out more aggressively to different constituencies, middle class suburbanites, consumer activists, young Americans and African-Americans, who didn't have as much connection to unions and often saw them as an ""entrenched interest"" that didn't have the best interest of the party in mind. These tensions started to play out in the 1972 election, when Meany endorsed Richard Nixon rather than Democrat George McGovern. Some working-class Americans proved to be more conservative on cultural issues and often opposed to civil rights policies that Democrats had promoted. And some union leaders felt that Democrats were becoming too dovish on foreign policy. The tensions continued to affect the electorate through the 2008 primary, when Hillary Clinton tried to appeal to working-class Democrats who felt that Obama favored other factions in the party. Finally, the expansion and strengthening of the lobbying world since the 1970s vastly increased the number of interest groups who favored business. These groups provided financial support to members of both parties and often made it difficult for Democrats to take a pro-union stand. But Democrats can't afford to lose the enthusiastic support of organized labor. Of all the groups in the Democratic coalition, labor remains the one with the greatest ground force and organizational strength -- and which represents a constituency rather than a particular issue (like the environment) -- that can help Democrats sustain a broad coalition. During Obama's struggle with Congress over health care, labor was essential in the final days of the congressional vote to convincing unhappy liberals to support a bill even without a public option. In this election, labor will be integral in the handful of swing states that will determine the outcome. With heightened economic inequality and high rates of unemployment, unions have the ability to have even greater resonance with the electorate. Obama and the Democratic Party will suffer unless the party starts to demonstrate that the concerns of working Americans are more than campaign rhetoric but are, in fact, a defining feature of their party.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A battle raged in a strategically located Libyan city Saturday as state television showed a fist-pumping Moammar Gadhafi visiting a school, his first public appearance in days. Rebels fought hard in a back-and-forth war for Ajdabiya, the last stop before their stronghold, Benghazi, further to the east. Witnesses reported three hours of fighting that they said involved explosions caused by NATO aircraft. As the sun set, the rebels appeared to have averted a major setback by maintaining control of the hard-won city -- but it was tenuous at best. Outgunned, they conceded they were facing a formidable foe. In a hospital, witnesses told CNN that three of Gadhafi's fighters who were killed were carrying identification cards from Syria, Algeria and Chad. NATO said in the past 24 hours its aircraft destroyed loyalist ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli that were supplying troops shelling Misrata and other cities. Attacks also were made on armored vehicles near Misrata and Ajdabiya, it said. Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya. ""There were some 50 regime pickup trucks with machine guns and rocket launchers that attempted to enter Ajdabiya,"" Abdulmolah said. ""The helicopters destroyed several of the trucks and the rest took off."" Abdulmolah did not know what kind of helicopters the rebel forces used in Saturday's attack and could not confirm whether rebel forces coordinated the operation with NATO. Far from the battleground, African leaders were meeting in Mauritania Saturday in an attempt to forge a mediator role in Libya's impasse. The African Union's special committee on Libya -- represented by Mauritania, Congo Republic, Mali, Uganda and South Africa -- will then travel to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi to meet with the opposition leaders Sunday and Monday, according to the South African government. The South African government also said NATO has granted the committee permission to meet with Gadhafi in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Gadhafi has been a big supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way. Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council. As such, opposition leaders in Benghazi did not express optimism over the success of mediation. The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Cairo Thursday to head meetings on Libya at the Arab League headquarters. Among the participants will be Catherine Ashton, the representative for foreign affairs and security for the European Union. Meanwhile, Libyan Foreign Minister Khaled Gaim condemned on state-run television the reopening of key ports in the eastern cities of Tobruk and Benghazi, which he said enables the rebels to resume an oil trade. He accused NATO of violating the United Nations Security Council resolution that mandates the protection of civilians. State TV also aired images Gadhafi visiting on Saturday what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli. The anchor said the school was a target of international airstrikes and was going to be attacked. Former U.S. lawmaker Curt Weldon visited Libya this week hoping to speak directly with Gadhafi but left without a meeting. He did manage to secure a letter from the strongman to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""I am disappointed that I did not get to sit down face to face with Colonel Gadhafi as promised, but I may have been able to get something even more significant -- a path to a resolution of this conflict,"" Weldon said in a statement on his departure. Weldon visited Libya in 2004 when he was a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and said he was invited this time by Gadhafi. Peace efforts seemed distant Saturday in Ajdabiya, where Gadhafi's forces attacked with a barrage of artillery fire at the city's western gates. Street fighting erupted as the loyalists, aided by sympathizers, entered the city. At one point, opposition fighters appeared to have all but lost again territory that was hard won. At the height of their march toward Tripoli, rebels came within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of Sirte -- Gadhafi's hometown in western Libya. But loyalist forces have steadily pushed the rebels back and now stand poised to run down the highway to Benghazi, the opposition's capital. Burnt carcasses of Libyan army tanks taken out by coalition aircraft three weeks ago litter the road. But it's increasingly harder to distinguish pro-Gadhafi troops. They have changed tactics and have taken to moving about in civilian vehicles. ""The troops of Gadhafi have good weapons and have training and have leadership and have experience,"" one rebel fighter said. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Reza Sayah and Nic Robertson contributed to this report .","NEW: Two opposition helicopters attack in Ajdabiya .

"(CNN) -- Doctors will often prepare for surgical procedures by opening instrument and supply kits that contain up to 100 items. Many of these items, such as scalpels, needles or sponges, go unused; they're just not needed for that particular procedure. But because of government or hospital regulations in the United States, they are frequently thrown away, even when they are still wrapped. ""There are thousands of tons of medical supplies thrown away every day that are unused or clearly reusable,"" said Dr. Bruce Charash, a cardiologist in New York. Fortunately, some nonprofit organizations, including Charash's Doc2Dock group, are finding ways to salvage these items and get them to people who need them desperately around the world. In Uganda, for example, many medical facilities lack the necessary supplies and equipment needed to perform surgery. The outlook is normally grim for children such as Priscilla, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 7. But one Ugandan hospital, CURE Children's Hospital in Mbale, has been able to operate on Priscilla and more than 1,100 other kids thanks to its partnership with MedShare, a nonprofit that collects surplus supplies and equipment from the U.S. ""Brain tumors happen to children all over the world,"" said Derek Johnson, executive director of CURE Uganda. ""The main difference in Uganda is that there are so few resources. But we were able to save Priscilla with supplies we get from MedShare."" 'Our trash becomes their riches' In the United States, surgical supplies aren't the only useful medical items tossed away. Richard St. Denis, one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011, collects discarded wheelchairs through his nonprofit, World Access Project. With help from another U.S.-based nonprofit, Hope Haven, the wheelchairs are refurbished by senior citizen volunteers and prison inmates in Iowa before being shipped to rural Mexico. St. Denis first visited Mexico in 1997, and he met many people with disabilities who didn't have access to wheelchairs, walkers or canes. ""I was shocked to see people using branches for crutches, being pushed in wheelbarrows and crawling,"" said St. Denis, who lost the use of his legs during a skiing accident in 1976. Now, he has a permanent residence in Mexico and continues to do everything he can to help the people around him. ""We want to distribute the more than 75,000 wheelchairs we estimate get thrown away in the U.S. every year,"" he said. ""What we call our trash becomes their riches, and it makes an incredible difference in their lives."" A win-win for everyone . In addition to saving lives, there's another benefit to sending unused supplies abroad. ""We are diverting a certain amount of waste that would be landfilled,"" said Dr. William Rosenblatt, a professor of anesthesiology at Yale University School of Medicine and founder of the nonprofit Remedy. ""At the end of a surgical procedure, our staff surveys the scrub table where the kit items remain and segregates all the materials that have been unused,"" Rosenblatt said. ""It gets sent down to (a) decontamination area, and Yale undergraduate students sort through it and take what is useful. From here, it is packaged in bulk and given to a charity to be taken overseas."" Sometimes, perfectly good equipment is thrown away. ""Why would (hospitals) throw out a working sonogram machine or a working hospital bed?"" Charash said. ""One, it's not pretty enough. Secondly, there might be new technology available. In general, no one wants to use a 2005 (model) if a 2012 is available."" Occasionally, a hospital will simply switch brands and get rid of an entire line of unused items. Supply manufacturers have been known to send items directly to the nonprofits if a box is so much as dented in transport -- items that could mean life or death for an individual in a Third World hospital. The need greatly outstrips the supply . ""On my first trip to Africa, the hospital director showed me a patient dying of malaria,"" Charash said. ""He showed me a room with hundreds of bottles of medicine that would save his life, but (the medicine was) not given to him because they had no intravenous lines. ""That day, our Doc2Dock container arrived with reconstituted IV lines and 3,000 to 4,000 syringes. The doctor got an IV line, the patient got the medicine and was saved."" But while unused medical equipment is saving many people around the world, only a small percentage of hospitals ever actually receive these items. ""If you look at the volume of appeals we get versus the amount we are able to help, we are able to find funding for a quarter of the bona-fide projects,"" said David Pass, chief advancement officer for MedShare. ""There is a great need out there."" The effort to find more funding is worth it, said Tanya Weaver of the American Foundation for Children with AIDS. Her nonprofit works in four African countries and has been able to help more than 100,000 people there thanks to surplus medical supplies from a couple of hospitals. ""If we can do this with the help of just two U.S. hospitals, imagine how many more could be served if others got involved,"" Weaver said.","Third World hospitals are saving lives with discarded medical materials from the U.S.
These supplies are clean, safe and unused but are thrown out for various reasons .
By salvaging surplus supplies, nonprofits are also reducing waste in America ."
"(CNN) -- Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, walked back her comments Thursday invoking images of domestic abuse when talking about Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. ""I shouldn't have used the words I used,"" she said through spokeswoman Lily Adams. ""But that shouldn't detract from the broader point that I was making that Scott Walker's policies have been bad for Wisconsin women, whether it's mandating ultrasounds, repealing an equal pay law or rejecting federal funding for preventative health care. Walker's record speaks for itself."" Wasserman Schultz has been heavily criticized in social media and in conservative media for saying Wednesday that Walker ""has given women the back of his hand"" because of his policies impacting women. She made the remarks while in Wisconsin campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke, who is trying to unseat Walker, the incumbent Republican. As the leading Democratic said her words were ill chosen, Walker responded to her comments for the first time Thursday. On the Jerry Bader show on Wisconsin radio station WHBL, he said his opponent, Burke, should ""absolutely"" speak out against them. ""I think anyone should. If anyone made comments like that, I don't care if they are Democrat, Republican or anyone else, to use language like that is just an affront and outrageous."" Burke, a former executive at Trek Bicycle Corporation, had already distanced herself from Wasserman Schultz's statement. Those comments are ""not the type of language that Mary Burke would use, or has used, to point out the clear differences in this contest,"" Stephanie Wilson, press secretary for Burke, said. ""There is plenty that she and Gov. Walker disagree on, but those disagreements can and should be pointed out respectfully."" Wasserman Schultz, who represents Florida, spent a total of several hours before and after the event with friend and colleague, Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, who has publicly spoken about her experience as a domestic violence victim. Women voters are critical to Democrats' voter base and are less likely to turn out for midterm elections. Burke has advanced in the polls, making the race between Burke and Scott extremely close, according to a trio of polls since mid-July. In the latest response by Adams, Wasserman Schultz slammed the congressional Republicans who opposed the latest version of the Violence Against Women Act, which gives legal protections for domestic violence victims. Moore came to Wasserman Schultz's defense. She ""applauds the chairwoman's audacity and courage in her pursuit to defend economic and social equality for all women,"" her spokesman, Eric Harris, told CNN. CNN's Ashley Killough and Steve Brusk contributed to this story.","Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz: I ""shouldn't have used the words I used""

"Editor's note: Seth Porges is a magazine editor and the creator of Cloth, an iOS fashion app for iPhone and iPod Touch. His Twitter handle is @sethporges. (Mashable) -- App appeal is obvious. The barrier to entry? So low! The upshot of producing the next Angry Birds or beer-chug simulator? So high! Heck, with just a small investment of time and cash, it's not hard for would-be mobile moguls to turn a concept into a steady stream of cash. And thanks to today's app stores, it's never been easier to try your hand at becoming the next tech tycoon. Here's (almost) everything you need to know before you get started on your own app -- and what I wish I knew before I got into the game. 1. What does it cost to make an app? If you're new to the app game, prepare for some sticker shock. Making an app will cost you, at the very minimum, around $10,000. This is for a super-simple program — none of that fancy enterprise or social networking jibber-jabber. Even still, any app worth its weight in code will likely cost you closer to $20,000. Unless you have some basic design skills, you'll need to enlist the help of both a programmer and a designer. And these guys ain't cheap — particularly programmers who, thanks to a pronounced shortage of qualified coders, can pretty much name their prices. (A suggestion for those low on funds: Find some creative way to come up with the cash. I funded my app through Airbnb income.) You can try to offload some of your costs by offering your guys equity; on the other hand, everybody tries to get free (or close to free) apps by offering developers equity. So unless you can really sell them on the strength of your idea (or bring something totally rad to the table, such as a celebrity), you better be prepared to pony up some cash. Of course, adding in some equity as a bonus is never a bad idea, so you'll probably want to dish out some shares too. This basic supply/demand dynamic also means that many developers ask for some pretty insane terms. Some demand deals that involve a huge upfront payment in exchange for a few weeks (or even just days) of work. And if a decent developer isn't already working full time, it's not unreasonable to assume he's at least a little commitment-averse. So, if you're serious about making something beyond a quickie cash grab, find a developer you are sure will stay with the project for updates, and not abandon it the second it hits the store. And get it all in writing. If you don't want to hire a lawyer, find a boilerplate contract online or get one from somebody else who's gone through the process, and just swap in your names and numbers. If you can, you'll also want to work with people who are local to you -- or at least with people who are willing to join you for regular Skype chats or Google Hangouts. I had weekly beer summits with my coder and designer, which proved super helpful as we continued to fine-tune our app well into its development. One more unavoidable cost: Apple charges $100 per year to hold onto a developer's account (which you need to publish your app). So be sure to reserve an extra Benjamin for your budget. 2. What should you charge for your app? I would consider starting one's app at or near $1.99. It's premium price, but it's also immensely satisfying to get more than a buck per download after Apple takes away its 30%. And, as with most things, it's a lot easier to lower the price later than it is to raise it. During the holiday period, we briefly played around with a special promotion that dropped our app price to $0.99. Predictably, this spiked our downloads, but it didn't actually raise our total revenue. Even on Christmas Day -- the single biggest download day for just about everybody — our revenue was actually higher a week or so later, once we had raised the price back to $1.99. The obvious exception: If your primary business model involves in-app purchases, ads or the like, you'll probably want to give your app away for free. After all, a quick glance at Apple's top grossing charts shows a whole bunch of free apps. 3. When will you get paid? Apple sends you cash one month at a time, up to 45 days after the month has ended. So, if your app goes live in January, you can expect your first kickback sometime in early March. Oh, and Apple only pays you if your earned amount totals at least $150, so you may have to wait before getting your first payment. Keep in mind, Apple only pays you through direct deposit. 4. How do you write your iTunes description? Don't try to rock the boat here. Take a look at a bunch of hit apps, and crib their formats. If it works for them, it'll work for you. Typically, this involves a quickie intro statement, press blurbs and a list of your key features. Then add some screenshots (the most interesting ones first) and call it a day. 5. What's the best way to beta test? Getting an unreleased app onto your friends' iPhones isn't the easiest thing in the world. My developer and I are in total agreement that the best method is a program called TestFlight, which makes it very easy to send build updates to registered devices, over the air. 6. What happens when you get featured on iTunes? Getting featured on iTunes is obviously awesome, but what exactly does it get you? When Apple included our app on its featured lists, we enjoyed a predictable flow of downloads almost identical in volume every single day we were parked there. Especially fascinating, the ""New & Notable"" list gave us almost exactly twice as many daily downloads as the ""What's Hot"" list. I'm assuming this is because, when you tap the ""Featured"" tab on the ""App Store"" app, ""New & Notable"" pops up by default. 7. How do you get press? As a longtime tech writer, the main advice I can give you in your pursuit for press is that less is more. If you think a site or publication would be into your app, don't e-mail the entire staff or the big boss — just find the writer who covers your category, briefly summarize your app in an email, and attach a download code (Apple gives you 50 for every update). Smaller sites may be more responsive than the big guys, and if you build up enough buzz, you can rest assured that the majors will come knocking. If a journalist doesn't get back to you, move on. And don't even touch that phone or personal e-mail address (unless that person is a freelancer) -- writers hate nothing more than phone or personal-inbox press pitches. Consider also producing an embeddable YouTube or Vimeo ad of some sort. Not only does this provide one more avenue for people to stumble upon your app, but it also gives bloggers something alive and colorful to toss into posts, which could increase the chances that they'll write about you. Keep it simple, and preferably, well under two minutes. And don't forget to promote over Twitter, Facebook, etc. 8. How do you avoid the spam? Within days of hitting the App Store, expect whichever email you linked to your iTunes developer's account to be pounded with spam. Most try to lure you into ponying over money in exchange for positive reviews, under the guise of ""mobile marketing."" Let's put it this way: If you don't regularly buy Viagra pills online, then you probably shouldn't give cash to these guys. Of course, if you're smart enough to make an app, you're smart enough to know this already. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- After Roger Federer's escape in the men's quarterfinals, there was yet more drama at the U.S. Open in Friday's women's semifinals. But the scenes inside Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York weren't as riveting as the Swiss' comeback from two match points and two sets down against Gael Monfils on Thursday. Whereas Federer walked off court as the winner, a teary Peng Shuai had to be taken off the court in a wheelchair moments after crumpling to the ground with what tournament organizers called a heat-related illness. Trailing 7-6 4-3, China's Peng -- in her maiden grand slam singles semifinal -- retired and it gave Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki a place in the final against Serena Williams. The resurgent Dane returns to a major final for the first time since the U.S. Open in 2009 -- she was the runner-up -- but didn't want to advance this way. ""It was very difficult,"" 10th-seeded Wozniacki told the crowd. ""You're out here and you want to battle and finish off properly. ""I just feel sorry for Peng, she played really well. It was really hot. Unfortunately, she fell ill and I hope she'll be okay."" Already a fan favorite, former No. 1 Wozniacki likely earned more backers when she crossed the net to check on the stricken Peng. Peng, who underwent heart surgery as a young junior, had to lean against the backboard on center court for support when she was first overcome by the pain while holding a break point in the final game of the match. She was helped off court, where an evaluation then medical timeout ensued. About 10 minutes later -- after Wozniacki was forced to wait for Peng without any recompense -- Peng played a few points prior to stopping and slumping to the ground. Unable to continue, she was forced to officially retire. ""You have to feel for Peng Shuai, being in her first grand slam semifiinal and having to leave the court like that,"" 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli, acting as a pundit for Britain's Sky Sports, said. ""And having to go through that much pain, it's pretty difficult. ""I remind all of us how hard it is to be on the court yourself. It's you and your tennis racket, and you have to compete. You have to beat the opponent, your conditions, beat everything really and be (as fit) as possible. ""It was really painful to watch as a person and player."" Before Peng's physical issues, it was a fiercely contested battle. Peng couldn't serve out the first set and also led by a break early in the second against Wozniacki, who revealed that she had been bed ridden herself the last couple of days. Peng's plight must have struck a chord with Williams. Appearing woozy, Williams had to retire from the doubles at Wimbledon in July. Her tussle against Ekaterina Makarova in the second women's semifinal lacked any drama. Williams, seeking her first grand slam title of the campaign and 18th overall, overpowered the Russian lefty 6-1 6-3. The lone worry for the two-time defending champion came when she was broken trying to serve out the contest. Sunday's finale figures to be close. Williams and Wozniacki met twice leading into the U.S. Open, and the current No. 1 prevailed in three tight sets on both occasions. A victory for Williams and she would tie legends Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert in grand slam singles titles. ""She obviously wants to win and go for her first grand slam and I want to win and make a little history,"" Williams told the crowd.","Caroline Wozniacki faces Serena Williams in the U.S. Open final .

"(CNN) -- Ten years from now, you could be sitting at home, feeling a little burned out. But then an app installed in your watch (or on your contact lenses), having monitored your vital signs, analyzed your mood and scanned through your social networks, will decide it's time you took a vacation and will present you with a selection of itineraries tailored to your budget and tastes. This is the picture painted by The Future of Travel, a report compiled at the behest of travel-booking site Skyscanner using a team of 56 editors, researchers and futurists. Though it reads a bit like a Douglas Adams' novel, the report's predictions are based on technologies that either already exist, or are in development. ""The technologies in the above scenario are either real, being tested, or undergoing prototype development,"" says Martin Raymond, co-founder of The Future Laboratory, who collaborated with Skyscanner on the report. Get (virtually) real . According to Gareth Williams, Skyscanner's CEO, in the future vacation photo albums will be replaced with immersive experience recordings. Oculus Rift, for instance, could allow users to record an African safari from their viewpoint, then share the virtual reality experience with friends back home. ""Wherever we have photos that are designed to inform you, we will ultimately also have 3-D immersive experiences,"" says Williams. Other companies are getting in on the act. This year, media company 3RD Planet developed a CGI tool that through virtual reality, puts users onto the street of various cities. Williams notes that as virtual reality becomes more commonplace, travel companies will give clients virtual tours of hotels, cities and experiences. ""They'll become conventional tools for destination marketing organizations and tourist boards,"" he says. Recordings will also have a tactile element. Users plugged into a virtual reality film will not only be able to see it in 3-D, they'll be able to feel the environment around them, be it the fur of a zoo animal or a sandy beach. Disney has already created REVEL, an interface that gives tactile feedback through minute vibrations from virtual 3-D objects, while Japanese company Tachi Lab is working on technology that can convert sounds into textures. Getting to know you . According to the report, by 2024 travel agents, tour guides and concierges could all be replaced by a virtual entity with a finely-tuned sense of your likes, which it will gather from your search history, online reviews, social media presence and various other digital interactions. This guide could live inside a piece of your clothing and come out as a hologram, and (perhaps mimicking your favorite actor) it will be able to have a conversation with you. ""It will essentially be an Artificial Intelligence device, constantly connected to the web, which has learned to intimately understand our individual preferences,"" says Daniel Burrus, a contributing futurist and author of Technotrends: How to Use Technology to Go Beyond Your Competition. These digital travel buddies will not only be able to tailor suggestions to you personally, they'll be able to monitor your expressions to see if you're actually enjoying yourself and tweak their recommendations accordingly (Tech firm Affectiva is already working on an algorithm that reads human facial expressions). ""As we get smarter in the tools we build, they'll become much more focused on what your motivation is, and what the appropriate search results are,"" says Williams. Wear it loud . Several experts envision Google Glass, the Sony Smartwatch and Samsung Galaxy Gear as the beginning of what will become a mass market in wearable technology (IMS Research predicts Google will ship 6.6 million units of Google Glass annually). Furthermore, microchips are predicted to get even smaller -- the width of 15 to 20 atoms by 2017, according to Renee James, president of Intel. This means it will be possible to implant technology in places previously deemed impossible (In the report, futurist Dr. Ian Yeoman predicts that Google Glass will move to contact lenses in five years). The implications of this technology are perhaps the most far-reaching of all. In ten years, your clothing (and eyewear) could simultaneously translate foreign languages, both spoken and written. Furthermore, Google Glass and its various successors could likely change the future of photography. ""At the moment, souvenir photographs are exclusively taken through planning,"" notes Williams. By 2024, rather than setting out to take a picture, Google Glass users could record their entire vacation, then instruct their device to pull out the best images. ""Technology will probably get good at suggesting moments that you most likely want to save,"" he adds.","Skyscanner teamed with 56 editors, researchers and futurists to create The Future of Travel report .

"Washington (CNN) -- A day before President Barack Obama lays out his strategy to counter the ISIS terror threat, House Republicans sought the counsel of Dick Cheney, a key architect of the Iraq War. Cheney huddled with House Republicans, saying Obama wasn't prepared for the terrorist threat posed by the group and urging the GOP to support a more muscular national defense, House GOP members told CNN. The closed-door meeting at the Capitol Hill Club was billed as a pre-midterm election pep rally. Cheney was there to boost enthusiasm among rank-and-file members, but he also told House Republicans that the party needs to rebuild the military and focus its public message this fall on the importance of a strong national security policy. Senior lawmakers say no vote in works on Obama's ISIS plan . Several Republicans who attended the meeting told CNN the former vice president didn't weigh in on the issue of whether the President needs any approval from Congress to continue or expand military action against ISIS. U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a former Iraq War veteran, acknowledged that his party was split on the issue but said it would be ""ludicrous"" for Congress not to hold some type of vote before the midterm elections. He said he believes the President has the authority to conduct airstrikes against ISIS, but argued it was lawmakers' responsibility to go on the record on the mission or the funding for a military operation. Kerry's mission: Mideast buy-in for anti-ISIS effort . Cheney, as he has done in recent public appearances, railed on Obama's foreign policy and defended the Bush administration's actions in Iraq. He said the Obama administration had failed to lock in a security agreement with the Iraqi government to keep some U.S. presence in the country to assist with the political transition, which Cheney asserted contributed to the instability there now. ""Doing nothing and pulling out -- he stressed several times -- was not a good national strategic policy,"" Rep Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, said of Cheney's remarks. Defending his record, Obama has argued it wasn't his decision to withdraw troops fully from Iraq; rather he said that the Iraqi people and its government didn't want a U.S. presence there any longer. ""The reason that we did not have a follow-on force in Iraq was because the Iraqis were -- a majority of Iraqis did not want U.S. troops there, and politically they could not pass the kind of laws that would be required to protect our troops in Iraq,"" Obama told reporters last month. Cheney: Iraq invasion was the 'absolute right thing to do' Some Republicans said Cheney warned that the military wasn't ready to respond to threats posed by terrorist groups around the world because budgets have been slashed. But Cheney's audience of fellow Republicans is partly responsible for those cuts. A year later, Obama again addresses nation on Syria . A significant chunk of the House GOP members serving today were elected after Cheney was vice president. In the last few years, there has been a growing divide inside the party about the U.S. role in international conflicts. Many elected in the last two elections have focused on shrinking the size of government and are skeptical of U.S intervention overseas. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, said the pitch to highlight national security was received positively by rank-and-file members, but he also admitted that the cost to boost the U.S. forces would be ""significant."" Terror fears could help GOP in midterms . Kinzinger told CNN he shared Cheney's concerns about declining military readiness. He said he hoped his colleagues who have focused on slashing federal budgets, listened to Cheney's warning about the declining resources for the military, specifically those caused by across-the-board cuts as a result of ""sequestration."" ""I hope my colleagues hear it, because you realize sequester is damaging when it's too late,"" Kinzinger said. Cheney told members he would outline more specifics about what action he advocates the United States should take in a speech Wednesday -- the same day as the President's prime-time address to the nation from the White House. A press release about Cheney's speech at the American Enterprise Institute is titled ""9/11 and the future of U.S. foreign policy."" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, summed up Cheney's advice to GOP members about the November elections: ""Keep the eye on the safety and security of the country.""","Former Vice President Dick Cheney was a key architect of Iraq War .

"(CNN) -- Having to ask for a seat belt extender on a flight was one of Benji Kurtz's biggest life humiliations. He also couldn't shop at popular clothing stores -- the clothing wasn't large enough. When he found clothing that fit, he often didn't have a choice in styles or colors, able only to purchase pants available in size 50. At his heaviest, in 2005, Kurtz weighed 278 pounds. Only 5 feet 5 inches tall, he was considered severely obese. For several years he cycled around low-carb diets to temporarily lose 30 to 40 pounds, only to gain it back. None of the many other diets he tried worked, either. Then, by chance, the solution found him. Over Memorial Day weekend 2013, Kurtz and his wife watched ""Forks Over Knives,"" a documentary on the science behind plant-based eating. At that point, he weighed 258 pounds. The scientific evidence presented on why humans should eat a plant-based diet just made sense to Kurtz. It was like a light bulb went on, he explains. He read numerous books and watched online lectures to learn more as he began eating from the four food groups recommended by the Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes (with nuts and seeds). Gradually, he cut out sugar, salt and oils. ""As I saw the scientific evidence of how we have evolved as herbivores and not omnivores, and as I saw how well my body was reacting to feeding it a low-fat, whole-food, plant-based diet, it became progressively easier from there,"" said Kurtz, a 37-year-old entrepreneur in Atlanta. The quick results were encouraging. It wasn't just his weight that started to drop. His cholesterol went from over 200 to 167. His blood pressure lowered. His health insurance rates also went down three times as he got healthier. At the same time, other things were on the rise, including his energy levels and his ability to taste food. ""Once you start eating this way, your palate totally changes,"" Kurtz said. ""You are tasting food the way food was supposed to taste in the first place. Like a film has been lifted off your taste buds."" He also discovered that he could eat as much as he wanted of the right foods and not gain weight. His new way of eating felt more like abundance than deprivation. Breakfast foods included oatmeal and fruit smoothies with almond milk. For lunch or dinner, his favorite foods became steamed vegetables with a faux Parmesan seasoning, red lentil chili, baked potatoes, vegan mac and cheese and split pea soup. If he got hungry in between meals, unsalted and unroasted nuts, fruit or chia pudding made with almond milk were his snacks. After one year and one day on his new diet, Kurtz had successfully lost 100 pounds. He now weighs 138, his pant size is 31 -- 19 sizes smaller than his heaviest -- and he wears a size small in shirts. Kurtz's story isn't uncommon, says Dr. John McDougall, a California physician who has been studying the effect of nutrition on disease for over 30 years and who answered diet questions from Kurtz during his transformation. After moving people away from a rich, high-fat American diet full of meat and dairy, McDougall says he's seen patients lose weight, be cured of constipation and lower their cholesterol levels. One of the biggest keys to these results, he says, is understanding that humans have always been primarily starch eaters; starches aren't bad. Pasta, beans, rice, corn and potatoes are foods that satisfy the body and can be alternatives to meat and dairy. ""People think they are going to starve to death if they don't eat a hamburger,"" McDougall said. McDougall went on to say that the marketing of meat and dairy has become so effective that we often associate calcium with dairy and protein with meat, when, according to him, it's quite easy to get those nutrients from a natural, vegetarian diet. Kurtz credits his ease in transitioning into this plant-based diet to living close to a grocery store where he could purchase healthy foods and working from home, which made it easier to cook. He also found a quiet indoor pool with a friendly staff where he swims around 20 laps six to seven days a week. ""I don't crave foods I no longer eat. I'm not going to bed hungry. Everything about life is better."" From overweight smoker to marathon contender .","Benji Kurtz tried almost every diet without success .

Escaped detainees from the Khilit al-Ferjan and Qasr Ben Ghashir camps provided testimony to the human rights group. The loyalist forces used grenades and gunfire on scores of prisoners at Khalit al-Ferjan after around 160 detainees fled a metal hangar.

"(CNN) -- A year after Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in Norway, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg urged Norwegians to ""honor the dead by celebrating life."" Breivik, a self-declared ultranationalist who raged against Muslim immigration and multiculturalism, failed to achieve his goals, Stoltenberg said Sunday. ""The bombs and bullets were intended to change Norway. The Norwegian people responded by reasserting our values,"" Stoltenberg said. ""The perpetrator failed to achieve what he set out to do. The people triumphed."" He called on people to remember their murdered loved ones with joy. Norway massacre, mourners pay respect . ""No one can take the warm memories away from you. A father's reassuring hand. The sounds from a child's playroom. The memories of goodness and joy cannot be erased,"" he said. And he asked Norwegians to respond to the horror by reaching out to people who may be suffering and in need of help. ""We will not forget you when the long days of summer give way to autumn darkness,"" he said at a ceremony marking the anniversary. ""Reach out. Show that you care. A chat about everyday things could help someone regain their will to live."" Norwegians observed a minute of silence to mark the worst atrocity on Norwegian soil since World War II, as Americans reeled from an enormous mass shooting two days earlier. James E. Holmes, 24, is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 in the suburban Denver community of Aurora during a midnight screening of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on Friday. In Norway, Breivik is on trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22, 2011 attacks. He admits bombing a government building in Oslo before heading to an island summer camp, where he opened fire as terrified youth jumped into water to escape the hail of bullets. The twin attacks killed 77 people, including 69 at the Labour Party summer camp. Many of the victims there were teenagers. The court must determine whether Breivik was sane at the time of the killings. Mental health experts have given conflicting opinions. Breivik gave chilling details of the gun rampage during his trial this year. Without apparent emotion, he recounted firing more bullets into teenagers who were injured and couldn't escape, killing those who tried to ""play dead"" and driving others into the sea to drown. Some survivors and relatives of victims in the courtroom wept as they listened to his detailed account of the attack on the youth camp on Utoya Island. Breivik told the court he had made use of lessons learned from al Qaeda in planning his attacks, and was inspired by the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. He boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, and says he acted out of ""necessity."" Experts' assessment of Breivik's sanity will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. His verdict is expected August 24. Numerous events are scheduled nationwide Sunday to mark the first anniversary of the killings, including religious services and wreath-laying ceremonies to pay tribute to victims of the attacks.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer set up an all Swiss final at the Monte Carlo Masters after beating an injured Novak Djokovic in the semifinal on Saturday. The 32-year-old swept to 7-5 6-2 win over the Serb who was hampered by a wrist injury to book a place in Sunday's final against compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka. Defending champion Djokovic, who was playing with a heavily strapped right forearm, battled hard but was powerless to stop Federer who wrapped up the win in just 75 minutes. The 26-year-old sustained the injury prior to the tournament he told reporters earlier this week and now faces a race against time to be fit for the French Open which gets underway on May 25. The world No. 2 revealed afterwards that the wrist does not need surgery but he couldn't say how long he might be out of action. ""I'm going to go see the doctors tonight and then tomorrow again have another MRI, see if anything changed in the seven days since I had the last one,"" Djokovic said. ""I'll just rest now. I cannot play tennis for some time -- how long, I don't know. It's really not in my hands anymore. I'm going to rest and see when it can heal 100%, then I will be back on the court."" Federer's victory secured a fourth final appearance at Monte Carlo in a tournament he has never won. ""For me it comes as a bit of a surprise to be in the finals again of a tournament this year, especially the first one on clay. But, of course, I'll take it,"" Federer said. ""I feel like I have put in the performance to be there, gave myself the opportunity this week. So I'm very happy with my play. Now I set up the dream finals for Stan and myself and Swiss tennis and the Swiss fans. It's very exciting times right now."" ""I think it's incredible that we are in the finals together, the same week we've been playing well for some time now. That we're able to have this moment together on a center court, it's so rare."" Wawrinka made light work of Ferrer, who 24 hours earlier had put out eight-time champion Nadal, winning through 6-1 7-6 (7/3). The 29-year-old raced through the first set in just over half-an-hour before overpowering a more aggressive Ferrer in the second. The world No. 3 will need to be on top form again in Sunday's final against Federer who holds a 13-1 advantage in head-to-head matches. Wawrinka will take heart from the fact that his solitary win came at Monte Carlo back in 2009 but also from the impressive showing against Ferrer. ""I'm not surprised with my game or the way I'm playing,"" Wawrinka said. ""Today was a little bit slower. It was a little bit windy at the beginning. It was important to move well, be aggressive. That was my plan. I started really well. I know when I'm moving well and I can dictate the game, I'm always good against him. I did a really good job, especially at the beginning.""

"(CNN) -- Respiratory illnesses caused by an enterovirus are sending hundreds of children to hospitals throughout the Midwest and Southeast, health officials say. Twelve states are reporting clusters of enterovirus illness: Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Utah. Six of those states -- Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri and Iowa -- have confirmed cases of Enterovirus D68, also known as EV-D68. Enteroviruses, which can cause a variety of symptoms, aren't unusual. If you've ever had a bad summer cold, it was likely caused by an enterovirus. The CDC estimates there are 10 to 15 million viral infections each year in the United States. The season often hits its peak in September. ""It's important to remember that these infections are very common,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general for the U.S. Public Health Service and the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. But this particular type of enterovirus -- EV-D68 -- is less common. And health officials are concerned by the number of hospitalizations it has caused this year. ""It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care. I would call it unprecedented. I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,"" said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, division director for infectious diseases at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. What parents should know about EV-D68 . Staff members noticed an initial spike on August 15, Jackson said. ""It could have taken off right after school started. Our students start back around August 17, and I think it blew up at that point,"" Jackson said. Many of the children who are being hospitalized have a history of asthma or wheezing, says Dr. Christine Nyquist, medical director of infection control at Children's Hospital Colorado. EV-D68 seems to exacerbate any breathing problems that aren't under control with medication. Survive the September asthma epidemic . Children's Hospital Colorado has seen a 12% to 15% increase in emergency room visits and admissions this month compared with the same time frame last year, Nyquist said. The hospital sent 25 samples to the CDC from patients with respiratory illness. Around 75% were confirmed to be EV-D68. On Monday, the CDC confirmed that 11 samples it tested from children who had been hospitalized in Chicago tested positive for EV-D68. Nineteen of the 22 specimens sent to the CDC from Kansas City also showed signs of the virus, meaning there is likely a regional outbreak. The Iowa Department of Public Health confirmed that EV-D68 cases have been identified in that state. Officials are hearing of illnesses across the state, they say, though there is not a firm count of how many people have been infected. Why enterovirus infections are difficult to track . EV-D68 was first identified in the 1960s, and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time. But it's possible that the relatively low number is due to the fact that the CDC doesn't require health departments to track EV-D68. ""It's one that we don't know as much about as we would like,"" Schuchat said. EV-D68 was seen last year in the United States and this year in various parts of the world. Over the years, clusters have been reported in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and various countries, including the Philippines, Japan and the Netherlands. Health officials don't know why the enterovirus has created such a problem this year. ""That's the scary part -- the unpredictability, I think,"" Nyquist said. The unusually high number of hospitalizations reported could be ""just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases,"" said Mark Pallansch, a virologist and director of the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases. As states continue to send samples to the CDC, the public health agency will get a clearer picture of the number of viral infections being caused. In the meantime, parents should be on the lookout for signs that their child is having difficulty breathing. Other common symptoms of the virus include coughing, fever and rash. ""It's important to make sure your children with asthma are on their medicines and keeping up with their medication routine,"" Schuchat said. Like other enteroviruses, EV-D68 appears to spread through close contact with infected people. To reduce the risk of infection, wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after changing diapers. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoid contact with people who are sick. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs, and stay home when you feeling under the weather to avoid infecting others. CNN's Jen Christensen, Elizabeth Cohen, Deanna Hackney, Michael Martinez, John Newsome, Matthew Stucker and Leslie Wade contributed to this report.","Enterovirus clusters seen in 12 states around the Midwest, Southeast .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez has made his mark in football, as one of the most feared strikers in the game. In more ways than one. Since joining the Dutch powerhouse club Ajax in 2007, the Uruguayan has established himself as one of the world's most inventive, tenacious and talented scorers. This past season, Suarez topped all others in England's Premier League with 31 goals. But now, it's a mark of a different kind -- near the shoulder of Italian national team defender Giorgio Chiellini -- that has everyone talking. TV cameras showed the two tangling during Tuesday's Italy-Uruguay World Cup showdown, with Suarez's head seemingly dipping toward Chiellini. Afterward, the Italian player got up, pulled down his shirt and seemed to passionately indicate he'd been bitten by the Uruguayan striker. If so, it wouldn't be the first time. There's a reason, after all, that some have dubbed Suarez the ""Cannibal of Ajax."" That dates back to 2010, when Suarez was suspended seven games after leaving a scar near the collarbone of Otman Bakkal while in the Netherlands. Soon after moving to Liverpool, he got fined $63,000 and banned eight matches for racist remarks directed at Manchester United's Patrice Evra. And let's not forget the 10-game ban he got in 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. These actions have helped Suarez become one of the most reviled players in the eyes of his opponents and their fans. ""If Suarez is guilty, no ban (is) too long,"" tweeted Ian Darke, ESPN's lead commentator for the World Cup, about Tuesday's incident. ""Totally beyond the pale. Alien to football."" The 27-year-old himself brushed off the accusations after the game, claiming that ""it will be complicated"" if there is an investigation into ""every collision in a football game."" ""The only thing I know is that those are occurrences that happen on the pitch,"" he said. ""I just collided with his shoulder. They are just casual incidences that occur."" FIFA starts disciplinary action against Luis Suarez after biting claims . For all his detractors, Suarez has many supporters. That's especially true among those who cheer on his teams -- including, right now, Liverpool and the Uruguayan national squad -- who hail him as ""El Pistolero"" for consistently firing into the back of the net. Born in Salto, a city of about 100,000 people near the Argentinian border, Suarez was a teenager when he began playing in his home country's top domestic league. He was a hit from the get-go, scoring 12 times and 29 appearances to lead his team to a league title in 2006. Europe came calling soon thereafter, beginning with a spot on the roster of Groningen in the Netherlands. He moved over to Ajax -- in the same country and, traditionally, one of the best clubs in the world -- in August 2007. Suarez ended his first season with Ajax with 20 goals. And he only got better. During the 2009-2010 season, the Uruguayan scored 49 times in all competitions, earning him Dutch player of the year honors. He made a seamless transition to Liverpool in January 2011. Controversy followed him to England, and so did his knack for scoring goals. Specifically, No. 7 netted 17 goals in his first full season with Liverpool, according to his official profile. That was just the start, with 30 scores in 2012-2013 and that figure-plus-one in the most recent complete campaign. The striker was so good that fellow players in England voted him player of the year. Thus, even if some hate him, he is still very much respected. And that's probably no more true than in Uruguay, where Suarez has come through time and again for the national team. That includes playing a huge role in the small South American nation's remarkable fourth-place finish at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Despite concerns that he might be derailed by a knee injury, Suarez has responded in Brazil as well. He scored both Uruguay goals against England, helping assure that team's hasty departure from the World Cup. And Suarez also factored into his team's 1-0 win Tuesday over Italy, even if he didn't score himself. With that win, Uruguay is moving on. The question is whether Suarez will be joining his teammates in the knockout round -- or whether he'll be suspended for his onfield antics, once again. Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl, for one, wondered openly on Twitter how ""if Suarez could keep it together for an entire Premier League season, why couldn't he at the World Cup?"" Roberto Martinez, manager of Premier League club Everton and an ESPN analyst, questioned how such a great player could act out so often -- if that's indeed what he did again Tuesday. There is no doubt (about) ... the talent that he has; he can win games single-handedly,"" Martinez said. ""But the behavior, I just seriously think that he needs help. You (have to) control yourself in those moments."" Reality bites, but Uruguay have their hero's back . How social media chewed up Luis Suarez .

"(CNN) -- Survivors of a mass shooting attack in Norway returned Saturday for the first time to the island where a gunman went on a rampage a month ago, killing 69 people. More than 1,000 people are expected to visit Utoya island Saturday, state broadcaster NRK said. Television footage showed young people picking their way along the shoreline and spreading across the small island. Many of those who survived did so by hiding among rocks and vegetation or swimming out into the chilly waters around the island. The survivors' visit comes a day after relatives of those killed were allowed to travel to the island for the first time to see where their loved ones' final moments were spent. Police officers were at hand to point out to the families exactly where those killed were found. Many lit candles and left flowers in makeshift shrines, local media reported. Several hundred people were attending a political summer camp held by the youth wing of the governing Labour Party at the time of the July 22 shooting attack. Many of those killed were teenagers. NRK said Saturday's visit was the first time many of the young people had seen one another since the traumatic events a month ago. The island remains a crime scene, as police investigate the mass shooting and the bombing of Oslo government buildings on the same day, which claimed the lives of eight more people . The suspect in both attacks, Anders Breivik, was ordered held in isolation for four more weeks Friday after appearing before a judge in Oslo. Giving his ruling, the judge said Breivik should continue to be held in solitary confinement because there was a real danger otherwise that he would tamper with evidence and hinder the police investigation. Breivik, 32, had told the court that being held in isolation is ""boring, monotonous and a sadistic method of torture,"" the judge said. Breivik admitted the attacks, a judge and his lawyer say, but has pleaded not guilty in court. Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby, of Oslo Police District, told reporters Friday that 400 witnesses had now been questioned in connection with the two attacks. Breivik will face further interrogation this week, he said. CNN's Cynthia Wamwayi contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 1,000 people are expected at Utoya island on Saturday, state media say .

"(EW.com) -- Adam ""MCA"" Yauch's death leaves a Beastie-size hole in pop music. Though the trio were not the most prolific legends on the landscape (over the course of 25 years, they released only seven proper albums), their impact has been gigantic. Starting with 1986′s ""Licensed to Ill,"" the Beastie Boys rewrote the rules for commercial hip-hop, the mainstreaming of hardcore punk, the state of sampling, and the treatment of the old school. ""Licensed to Ill,"" one of the early full-lengths released by influential hip-hop label Def Jam Records, is often referred to as the first rap album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart. That title is a little unfair, as those sales were powered by the wildfire success of ""(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party)"" — a track that many at the time considered more rock than rap. The remainder of ""Licensed to Ill"" is pure mid-'80s hip-hop: grimy, tricky, and funny. The rhyme trading on ""Fight for Your Right"" was child's play compared to the exchanges on ""Hold It, Now Hit It,"" ""She's Crafty,"" and ""Paul Revere."" Though it is hard to believe now, the Beastie Boys' race rarely came up — in part because hip-hop was a new genre, but also because they had the legitimate skills to counter criticism. It helped that they kept pushing the form forward on subsequent releases. Though 1989′s ""Paul's Boutique"" was a commercial failure at the time, it is now held up as a brilliant piece of art way ahead of its time. Working with the Dust Brothers, the Boys constructed a pastiche that flowed so deftly that it became common for owners of the vinyl to play ""Spot the Sample."" For DJs and genre-bending artists like Beck, Paul's Boutique was a keystone holding up a cathedral of sonic possibilities. Though hip-hop had always incorporated rock samples and toyed with live instrumentation (Afrika Bambaataa liked to toss Rolling Stones records into his break beats), ""Licensed to Ill"" also essentially invented rap-rock. ""Fight for Your Right"" is the obvious example, but Slayer's Kerry King (another signee of Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin) also lent some shredding guitar to ""No Sleep Til Brooklyn."" ""Rhymin' and Stealin'"" is built around samples from Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and the Clash. Yauch's first love was hardcore punk — the early Beastie Boys were a speedy, noisy act who opened for Black Flag and Bad Brains. Those fixations ran through ""Licensed to Ill"" through the group's two peak albums, 1992′s ""Check Your Head"" and 1994′s ""Ill Communication."" It wasn't so much that they brought punk attitude to hip-hop (Public Enemy figured out that trick at the end of the '80s), but it was about the fact that traditional rock music — and later, jazz — could coexist next to traditional rap. Over the course of their last three albums — 1998′s ""Hello Nasty,"" 2004′s ""To the 5 Boroughs,"" and last year's ""Hot Sauce Committee Part Two"" — the Beasties looked to be returning to everyone else's old school, tapping into elements of classic hip-hop that had disappeared as the style became the preeminent movement on pop radio. ""Hello Nasty"" sounds like a reaction to the Diddy-fication of rap in the late '90s, with its focus on breaking down hip-hop into core sonic elements and executing them with breathtaking precision. It's most evident on the classic call to arms ""Three MCs and One DJ,"" but it's also plastered across tracks like the funky ""Super Disco Breakin',"" the minimalist ""Instant Death,"" and the neck-snapping single ""Intergalactic."" To the 5 Boroughs and Hot Sauce Committee Part Two both work to preserve hip-hop's past rather than trying to innovate, but the trio's curatorial minds are so sharp that they both act as a living tribute to the New York streets that birthed rap. They are reflective, thoughtful albums that leave room for fun.

"(CNN) -- Eating right is no easy task, especially when there's so much contradicting information online. Google is hoping to make it a little simpler by providing easy-to-see nutrition info for more than 1,000 foods. Similar to the way measurement conversions or flight prices pop up in a box at the top of your search results, Google will display the number of calories, fat grams and other key nutrition facts for everything from bananas to burritos. ""You can simply ask, 'How much protein is in a banana?' or 'How many calories are in an avocado?' and get your answer right away,"" Google product manager Ilya Mezheritsky wrote on the site's blog. ""You'll hear the answer to your specific question, see relevant nutrition information under an expansion, and be able to switch to other related foods or serving sizes."" That's right, he said ""hear."" Using Google's voice search feature, which the company introduced last month, you can ask your question out loud and get an response ASAP. Simply click the microphone icon near the Google search bar. Studies show that people consistently underestimate the number of calories they're consuming. Some of this comes from misinformation. Oftentimes, what one calorie-counting app says is 350 calories is listed as 475 on another source because they're user-generated. Google's nutrition info will rely on the company's Knowledge Graph, an intelligent model that summarizes information from reputable sources across the Web. In this case, most of the data will come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, according to Google. ""The graph helps us connect things that are related,"" Mezheritsky explained. ""For example, when you ask for 'summer squash carbs,' we include 'zucchini' as a relevant food in the dropdown, because it is a type of summer squash."" The new nutrition search results will be rolling out in English in the United States over the next 10 days.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- At least two people were killed and 48 others injured Saturday when a Russian passenger plane skidded off a runway after an emergency landing in Moscow. The plane made an emergency landing after all three of its engines failed, Russian Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Veronika Smolskaya said. There were 155 people aboard, including seven children, she said. Of the injured, six people were hospitalized in the nearby town of Vidnoye, according to the ministry, and another 20 were on their way to local hospitals. The flight landed at Moscow's Domodedovo airport about a half hour after it took off from Moscow's Vnukovo airport, headed for Makhachkala in southern Russia, Smolskaya said. The plane was a Tupolev-154 belonging to Dagestan Airlines, she said.

"(CNN) -- Every two seconds, somewhere across China a customer takes delivery of a new car -- part of a consumer buying blitz that will see China add 21 million new cars, trucks and buses to its fleet total in 2014. Short of a catastrophic economic downturn, a government edict against new car ownership, or draconian traffic congestion charges, a continuation of that growth rate means China will likely have a bigger motor vehicle fleet than the United States by 2020. Indeed, the combination of a low vehicle penetration rate -- only 85 vehicles for every 1,000 people in China, compared with more than 800 per 1,000 in the U.S. -- and the consumer aspirations of high-income, urbanized households across China almost guarantees it. As many as five million of the 260 million-plus vehicles on Chinese roads in 2020 will be plug-in hybrids or battery electric vehicles, while others will use fuel cells. Many of the country's taxis, trucks and buses will run on compressed natural gas. There will be multiple fuel-saving aids and financial incentives. Petroleum demand . But overwhelmingly, passenger cars will still run on gasoline and diesel fuel, which is why Chinese demand for petroleum is the key factor in the global energy outlook for 2014 and beyond. China is already the world's biggest energy consumer and must import 60% of the crude oil it needs to meet its transport and refinery needs, as well as to fire some of its industries and power plants. Much of the estimated 10.5 to 11 million barrels of oil that China consumes every day comes from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern suppliers, and many of the Middle Eastern crude carriers must pass through the Strait of Malacca ""choke point"" between Malaysia and Indonesia en route to China. That logistical vulnerability troubles China. So while its transport sector's oil demand is growing, China is trying to lessen its reliance on oil for power by putting greater emphasis on coal, nuclear, natural gas and renewable sources such as solar, wind, biomass and hydro power. Already it has the world's largest installed base of wind power (76 gigawatt at the end of last year), and is the dominant producer of photovoltaic modules for the solar power industry. Diversified energy supply . At home, China is pushing ahead with the search for and development of more domestic hydrocarbons, including unconventional resources such as shale gas, tight oil and coal-bed methane. At the same time, its focus on a diversified energy supply means it invests in and encourages oil and gas imports via pipelines from Central Asia, Russia and the new pipeline route from the Indian Ocean through Myanmar. Further afield, it is investing in North and South American oil and gas assets, from shale fields in western Canada to heavy crude in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In the next few years, more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Australia, Papua New Guinea, North America and Africa will enter the Chinese energy equation, along with Russian LNG from the remote Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia via the Northern Sea Route, the shorter but more hazardous shipping route that runs through Arctic waters to the Bering Strait and thence to the Pacific Ocean. All of this means that China, and not the U.S., will be a key target market for the world's major oil exporters in future. China's oil import needs are growing, just as North America's are declining on the back of its shale gas bonanza over the past five years and the more recent emphasis on oil production in places such as North Dakota's Bakken field. China already has eclipsed the U.S. as the top net oil importer. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), China's net oil imports in September were 6.3 million barrels a day, ahead of a net figure of 6.13 million barrels a day for the U.S. It said this trend was likely to continue in 2014. Overall the U.S. will likely remain the world's biggest oil user in 2014, with the EIA expecting it to consume the equivalent of 18.7 million barrels a day. China's figure will be about 11 million barrels a day. Auto love . But that order could change over the next decade, if China's love affair with the motor car continues unabated. Global passenger car sales next year will reach almost 75 million, according to a forecast earlier this month by the German Automotive Industry Association (VDA). When trucks and buses are included, the total will likely reach 85 million. Between 23 and 24 million of those sales will occur in China, while the U.S. will account for about 16 million vehicles in 2014 and peak at 17 million in 2017. In contrast, Chinese demand may well grow to between 25 and 30 million vehicles a year later this decade. Even though major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have begun to introduce vehicle-use restrictions to combat traffic congestion and pollution, analysts expect the consumer action will simply move to other less-crowded venues. Already, leading global carmakers like VW, GM, Hyundai, Toyota and their Chinese joint venture partners are targeting second, third and fourth-tier cities where the car ownership growth opportunities may be greatest. In a study last year, management firm McKinsey said that apart from government restrictions and a growing used-car market, other factors that could impact on China's new car sales over the next decade include industry consolidation, improved public transport options and the growth of car-sharing and car rental businesses. At the same time, McKinsey said more Chinese buyers were looking for bigger, better and more expensive vehicles such as sports utility vehicles. That will ensure China becomes the biggest player in the global energy-for-transport sector. It will also be the world's biggest user of electric vehicles and a potential pioneer of fuel cells. In contrast to the Chinese experience, car and light truck fuel use is declining sharply in the U.S. A combination of fuel efficiency and changes to driving behavior means there will likely be a 25% drop in light-duty vehicle energy consumption between now and 2040, the EIA said in its 2014 annual energy outlook released on December 16.","Analysis: China's ""love affair"" with motor vehicles drives demand for oil .

"Valley Springs, California (CNN) -- A 12-year-old California boy accused of stabbing his 8-year-old sister to death was charged Wednesday with second-degree murder. Appearing in a green jumpsuit in juvenile court, he said, ""Yes"" when asked if he understood the charges. He didn't enter a plea. The boy didn't appear to be nervous, shocked or stunned. He smiled while talking with his lawyer and several times he looked back at his family. He will remain in custody while he awaits his next court appearance on May 29. The boy's younger sister, Leila Fowler, was stabbed multiple times in her family's home in northern California on April 27 while she was there with her youngest brother. ""He's holding up well under the circumstances,"" one of the boy's attorneys, Mark Reichel, said Tuesday. The boy, who was arrested Saturday, told police a man broke into the family's home. Sources: Suspect in sister's death had knife at school . After the killing, police described the suspect as a 6-foot-tall white or Hispanic male with a muscular build. They interviewed registered sex offenders in the area, ran down leads and searched in attics, storage sheds and more in the rural, mountainous community about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento. On the day of the killing, Leila's father and his fiancee weren't home. A woman called 911 and told a police dispatcher her children were scared because a strange man had broken into the house, according to an emergency call released Tuesday. When the dispatcher asks what the emergency is, the woman tells her: ""My children are home alone, and a man just ran out of my house. My older son was in the bathroom and my daughter started screaming. When he came out there was a man inside my house. I need an officer there."" Slain girl's stepmom pleads for privacy after son's arrest . The woman says that the boyfriend of an older daughter was on the phone with the children in the house. The dispatcher asks if the children had seen the man and if they could describe him. ""They did see him, yes. My daughter is freaking out right now,"" she says. After giving the dispatcher a home phone number, she adds, ""They said they are OK, but I need you to come."" Although the call indicates the girl was alive and well, when police arrived, they found she had been stabbed. Leila died minutes after arriving at the hospital, authorities said. She died of shock and hemorrhages from her wounds, the Calaveras County Coroner's office said. Before Leila's death, the boy's middle school in Valley Springs suspended him for five days after he brought a knife to school, according to one of the boy's classmates. That account was backed up by a school administration source. Authorities haven't revealed what kind of knife was used in Leila's death. The death of Leila, known for her bubbly personality, shook the small northern California town of Valley Springs, where ribbons in her favorite color of purple were tied to stop signs.

"(CNN) -- Public transport in the Belgian capital, Brussels, was paralyzed for a fourth day Tuesday after staff walked out to protest the death of a co-worker in an assault. Guy Sablon, a spokesman for the company that runs the Brussels public transport network, STIB, told CNN there are no buses, trams or trains operating in the city. The workers have demanded new security measures to keep staff safe. The city's transport network was shut down Saturday after a traffic accident involving a car and a bus led to a fatal assault. Sablon told CNN that a friend of the car driver had punched an STIB supervisor who was taking pictures of the accident scene. When the man saw the supervisor taking the photographs, ""he completely lost it,"" Sablon said. ""He then punched him in the face, and unfortunately this punch killed the supervisor."" Sablon said the attack was not an isolated incident. ""Every day, our staff suffer aggressive abuse from clients, so they have unfortunately gotten used to aggressive situations,"" Sablon said. ""Therefore, we have endorsed this strike and demanded measures from the government."" Both the Belgian government and the STIB announced new measures Monday evening. STIB announced that it will recruit 50 new security officers, on top of the 190 officers it already has. As a short-term response, it will also move some of its staff from duties such as checking tickets to security roles. The government also announced that it would hire 400 new police officers, dedicated to working on the public transport network. ""Now the unions have to explain these measures to their members. We had hoped that they would be back at work this morning, but they were not ready to return to work. So we will see how long the strike will last,"" Sablon said. ""These are very good measures, and they will have a big impact. It will just take some time to implement them,"" he added. Brussels is home to NATO, the European Commission and European Council, as well as many other international organizations.","A transport company supervisor died after he was punched by a member of the public .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Norway mass killer Anders Breivik should be considered sane and acquitted for the attacks that left 77 people dead, his lawyer said in closing arguments Friday. Breivik has admitted carrying out the July 22 attack on a Labour Party youth camp on Utoya Island that killed 69 people and a bombing targeting government workers in Oslo that killed eight. But Breivik, who boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, says he acted out of ""necessity."" Defense lawyer Geir Lippestad argued that Breivik should be fully acquitted on the charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in Norway -- and that this should be on the grounds of necessity, not insanity. If Breivik is not acquitted, he should be given the lightest possible sentence, Lippestad said as he wrapped up his closing arguments. He asked the judges to discount the claim by prosecutors that Breivik is mentally ill and should be transferred to a psychiatric institution. Many friends and relatives of the victims left the courtroom in protest as Breivik rose to give his own closing argument, the last one heard before the trial concluded. He described his actions on July 22 as ""barbaric"" but said that only two of more than 30 experts who have evaluated him consider him insane. Some in the courtroom laughed as he made points criticizing Norway's multicultural society and moral values. The court ruled that his speech could not be broadcast. After Breivik's statement, the judges said the verdict would be delivered August 24. Several outcomes are possible. Prosecutors have asked that Breivik be acquitted on the grounds of insanity, in which case he would be held in a secure mental health unit. If he is fully acquitted on the grounds of ""necessity,"" as urged by his defense, he could go free. If he is ruled sane and found guilty of some or all the charges, he would be sentenced to prison time. Earlier, applause greeted the accounts of survivors and relatives of those killed when they addressed the court. The judges and prosecutors were among those displaying emotion as they listened, with some moved to tears. Outside the courtroom, one of the survivors of the Utoya attack, Tore Sinding Bekkedal, said he was ""very relieved this trial has been as dignified, thorough, proper as it has been."" Seeing the legal system treat it like any other criminal case has been the best show of strength possible, the 24-year-old said. Bekkedal, a youth politician in Oslo, said the case had highlighted the danger of Islamophobia in Norwegian society and the need to fight it. Hearing fellow survivors testify about the attacks on Utoya had been less difficult than seeing their impact on the relatives of those killed, he said. ""You meet people who have lost relatives and children, sisters and brothers, and it's a much more profound bereavement than losing friends, even though I did lose some very good friends and role models,"" he said. The issue of Breivik's sanity has been at the heart of the case. If he is not found to be mentally ill, prosecutors will ask for a prison sentence of 21 years, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said. Giving his closing arguments Friday, Lippestad sought to argue that his client's past did not point to a history of violent acts but rather to political activism. ""The central criterion for insanity is that the ability of realistic assessment of one's relationship to the outside world is largely abolished,"" he said. ""Is it violent fantasy that is the mother of these actions, or is it his political opinion?"" The lawyer outlined Breivik's political life and activity as heard by the court, from the early days when he was member of a party to the extreme political arguments he posted online. Lippestad also recalled how Breivik's mother and his friends said he was intense when he talked about politics but never said he was intense about violence. He questioned an initial psychiatric report given to the court that said his client had been acting under a delusion, saying Breivik's radicalization had developed through his engagement with extremist communities online. The lawyer cited Breivik's active stock trading, social life and preparations for the attacks as examples of how he did not meet the criteria to be considered insane. Under those criteria, he should be disinterested, aimless, inactive, self-centered and socially withdrawn, Lippestad said. ""That he has been aimless is certainly the last thing I would call this man,"" he said. Lippestad also argued that Breivik had chosen his targets politically, noting that he didn't attack nonpolitical people like the captain on the boat to Utoya and the youngest children on the island. ""Breivik knew that killing was wrong, but it's what any classic terrorist does,"" he said. The lawyer told the court he shared the prosecutor's view that the attacks, which he called ""a cruel act of terrorism,"" were almost too horrible to be true. But, he said, the key question for his client was whether he acted under the legal principle of ""necessity."" Lippestad has previously said it is important to Breivik that people see him as sane so they don't dismiss his views. Last month, Breivik promised that he would not appeal if a court finds him sane and guilty. Bjorn Ihler, a survivor of the Utoya attack, said it is down to the court to deliver a ""good and fair judgment"" on Breivik, in accordance with Norway's longstanding principles of justice. Its ruling on whether he is sane matters less than the fact that Breivik's extremist views are shared by other people, he said. However, listening to Breivik in court had made him appear as less of a ""scary monster,"" Ihler said. ""Now it's just a pathetic man sitting there."" Asked what his personal message to the court would be, he said, ""I am still alive. I'm a survivor, not a victim, and I will live on and fight on to work against future extremist acts."" The issues thrown up by Breivik's trial have led the Norwegian authorities to re-evaluate the country's provision for holding dangerous criminals who are found to be insane. The government proposed amendments to the Norwegian Mental Health Care Act in May, aiming ""to strengthen the security measures relating to a small group of particularly dangerous patients."" The current law allows ""too great a risk for escape, hostage-taking and severe violence against patients and staff"" in the health institutions where such patients are currently housed, a statement from the Ministry of Health and Care Services said. The new legislation would strengthen security measures and allow for a high-security unit to be based within a prison, opening the possibility that Breivik could be held in a secure unit in the same Ila Prison where he has been detained for almost a year. The amendments will come into force July 1. In the course of the trial, which started in mid-April, the court has heard grueling testimony from the survivors of the July 22 attacks. Survivors and relatives of those killed and injured have also been present in the courtroom to hear Breivik give his account of the events of that day and the motivation for his acts. In his testimony early in the trial, Breivik claimed to represent a ""European resistance movement"" and ""Europeans who don't want our ethnic rights to be taken away."" The shocking attacks prompted Norwegians to reassert their commitment to multiculturalism and tolerance at a series of mass public tributes. CNN's Diana Magnay and Laura Smith-Spark, and journalist Olav MellingsÃ¦ter in Oslo contributed to this report.","The trial ends, and judges say the verdict will be delivered on August 24 .

"(CNN) -- Scout Willis definitely walks the walk. The 22-year-old daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis took a topless stroll down the streets of New York and documented it on social media to protest what she says is discrimination on the photo sharing site Instagram. Wearing just a skirt, shoes, her purse and a determined look, Willis walked around the streets of Manhattan and even did a bit of shopping for some flowers. She tweeted the pics as well as ""Legal in NYC but not on Instagram,"" and ""What @Instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple."" The New York Daily News reported that Willis launched her skin campaign after Instagram removed one of her photos it said violated its community guidelines. The picture reportedly included a sweatshirt that depicted two topless women with the nipples visible. The actress said Instagram removed her account, but she complained that other explicit photos -- including one with a woman hiding her nipples using a pair of handguns -- were allowed. ""Made a new Instagram, gonna post lots of beautiful photos of naked women I think. Tasteful, non aggressive, whomever wants to see can, if not,"" Willis tweeted before her topless walk.

"(CNN) -- The prospect of a winter World Cup in 2022 looks set to become a reality after Europe's football associations voted against holding the tournament in the Qatari summer. All 54 member associations of UEFA, Europe's governing body, backed the decision at the meeting in Croatia Thursday. ""They all agreed that this competition could not take place in the heat of Qatar in the summer,"" FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce told CNN. ""At the end of the day common sense has to prevail here and I'm glad at long last common sense has prevailed,"" he added. FIFA, the game's world governing body, has been considering the option of moving the tournament because of fears that players and fans would be adversely affected by the searing heat, which can reach 122 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer. FIFA President Sepp Blatter recently stated that it would not be feasible to hold a summer World Cup in Qatar and will make a decision on the timing of the tournament at the Executive Committee meeting in Zurich, Switzerland on October 3 and 4. A winter World Cup would cause chaos with the European domestic season with clubs fearing they could lose out financially. ""What has to happen now is that the people who are involved, including the people from Qatar, they have to sit down and work out a situation that's going to cause (as) minimum (a) disruption that can possibly be made to football,"" said Boyce. ""Not only in Europe but throughout the world. ""There are nine years to plan the World Cup and surely with common sense this can be overcome."" UEFA President Michel Platini, who voted for Qatar, believes a move to January or February would suit his members. ""I was very happy to learn that FIFA president Joseph Blatter wants to move the 2022 World Cup to the winter, something I've long advocated,"" the Frenchman told the media last month. Platini also rejected claims by the chief executive of the English Premier League, Richard Scudamore, who claimed switching the World Cup was ""well nigh impossible,"" citing disruption to the calendar and the impact on lucrative television deals. He added: ""For 150 years, England has imposed its calendar and we've respected it. ""So for once, for one month, England could respect another calendar."" FIFA's decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has led to huge criticism with Australian football chiefs threatening legal action. Australia, which lost out to Qatar along with South Korea, the U.S. and Japan, believes it should be compensated if the World Cup is held in the winter rather than the summer. Earlier this week, the Football Federation of Australia laid out its case which it expects FIFA's Executive Committee to examine. ""An in-principle decision that just and fair compensation should be paid to those nations that invested many millions, and national prestige, in bidding for a summer event,"" it said. ""If there is consensus within the Ex-Co that a change in date should be considered, then a transparent process should be established to examine the scheduling implications for all leagues and a method developed for agreeing appropriate compensation for those affected."" That case is unlikely to succeed according to a FIFA spokesperson, despite the pressure from the Australian FA. A FIFA spokesperson told CNN: ""As part of the bidding documents all bidders, including the FA Australia, accepted that the final decision regarding the format and dates of the staging of the FIFA World Cup and FIFA though initially expected to be in June/July, remains subject to the final decision of the FIFA Organizing Committee. ""There is no ground for any speculations.""","UEFA backs plan to move 2022 Qatar World Cup to winter .

"(CNN) -- Five years ago, Brandon Howell stood trial on two murder charges. He got off. Now he stands accused again, this time of allegedly killing three people -- apparently strangers to him -- in a tranquil Kansas City, Missouri, neighborhood. Two other victims are fighting for their lives in a local hospital, Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said on Wednesday. Prosecutors didn't win a conviction in the 2009 murder trial against Howell, in part because the bodies of the two victims were never found. But this time could be different, the prosecutor says. ""I woke up this morning, very determined and resolved to get justice in this case,"" Peters Baker said upon learning Howell had been charged again with murder. ""And that's what we're going to do."" Howell, 34, was arrested after a perilous 12 hours during which three people died, two were left injured, one victim's car was stolen and another three individuals were assaulted at a motel. Peters Baker said that, based on the murder charges against him, a judge opted not to set bond for Howell, meaning he'll be held in Jackson County Jail presumably until his trial on the new charges. Meanwhile, those affected by the violence he's accused of -- from the two hospitalized victims, to kin of the three people killed, to neighbors, to those allegedly attacked at the hotel -- have a hard road ahead as well. They're challenged to come to grips with the brutal, seemingly random nature of what happened. ""It scares all of us,"" Peters Baker said. ""Because that is a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood, and it got hit tragically by a senseless, senseless acts of violence. ""But that perpetrator is behind bars right now,"" she added. 3 people killed were ages 63, 69, 88 . The first sign of trouble came shortly after noon Tuesday, when a woman called 911 and said briefly, ""Help at address, shotgun."" Then the call ended. Kansas City police responded to find a woman, later identified as 69-year-old Suzanne Choucroun, dead on a driveway, according to a probable cause statement. They then went inside a neighbor's home and found a male and female apparently ""assaulted and ... severely injured"" in the basement. In a front yard a few doors down, authorities came across 63-year-old Darrel Hurst and his 88-year-old mother Alice Hurst -- both of whom had been shot dead. Witnesses shed more light on what happened, according to police, including how Choucroun was shot by a man with a shotgun after she'd left her residence. Not only that, but the suspect had sped away in a Toyota Highlander belonging to one of his victims. The hunt was on. It led to a Motel 6, where three people -- one of whom had cuts on his head -- told police they'd been followed by a man and assaulted, before the alleged assailant ran off on foot. The discovery of the stolen Toyota Highlander a short ways down the road helped authorities make the connection: The man allegedly behind the quintuple shootings was also the man at the hotel. Six hours later -- just before midnight (1 a.m. ET Wednesday) -- they had a suspect in custody, Brandon Howell. They also had what Peters Baker says was the murder weapon, a 12-gauge shotgun that still had ""four shotgun shells in the magazine tube, making it readily capable of lethal use,"" according to the probable cause statement. Suspect is a convicted felon . The fact that Howell had that gun was reason enough for authorities to charge him with unlawful possession of a firearm. He was convicted in a Kansas court in 2000 of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault and attempted aggravated robbery. Convicted felons aren't supposed to have guns -- even if they'd purchased them, as was true in this case, prior to their conviction. Questioned about why a convicted felon allegedly did possess a gun, Peters Baker responded: ""Did law enforcement go door-to-door to check under pillows or his bed for firearms? Probably not. ""But he's a convicted felon and fully understands that ... you're not allowed to possess a firearm."" Howell faces three first-degree murder, two first-degree assault, burglary and other charges. It's also possible that this case -- or at least the shotgun -- could shed light on the first time that Howell was charged with murder in the deaths of Tabitha Brewer and Nick Travis. Peters Baker said she called the Brewer and Travis families, as well as the prosecutors who tried but failed to win a conviction in their deaths, soon after Howell was connected to these new killings. Kansas City Mayor Sly James recalled that being a difficult case to prosecute, absent the victims' bodies or witnesses: ""(Prosecutors) did everything they could. But in a circumstance like that, you have to have almost overwhelming evidence. And that evidence simply was not there."" This time around, authorities have a lot more to work with. They have victims, they have a weapon, they have ballistic evidence, and they have witnesses. ""From this point,"" Peters Baker said, ""we will roll up our sleeves and get to work."" CNN's Laura Ly, Dave Stewart and Teri Genova contributed to this report.","NEW: Brandon Howell, 34, faces first-degree murder, assault and other charges .

McClean and Kevin Richardson -- aka the Backstreet Boys -- got back to what made them famous: singing and dancing in front of hoards of screaming (mostly female) pop music fans. The free concert closed out The Grove's 2013 Summer Concert Series, a month-long promotion that included performances by Sara Evans and Capital Cities in previous weeks. The Boys' 35-minute set attracted 17,500 fans. The performance comes just one day after the release of the band's latest studio album, ""In A World Like This"" -- they released two additional albums without Kevin Richardson -- and continues their 20th anniversary celebration, which includes receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an upcoming documentary film and a world tour that kicks off Friday, August 2 in Chicago. With more than 130-million album sales worldwide, the Backstreet Boys know they are the best-selling boy band of all time, but they also know this one-time golden statistic has, to a degree, lost its sheen amid the music's industry's new measures of success: ticket sales, sponsorships, downloads, clicks, tweets and Likes. By this standard, the Boys are not quite back. With ages ranging from 33 (Carter) to 41 (Richardson), any one of the Backstreet Boys could have been Justin Bieber's much older brother, if not his father -- and it's not missed on the guys just how big a difference one generation can make. In a candid and revealing turn, the men of the Backstreet Boys offer their take on music in the age of YouTube, react to the ""haters"" and explain why starting their careers in schools, malls and pet stores was just right for them. CNN: Describe your new album in a word. Brian Littrell: Growth. Howie Dorough: Timeless. A.J. McLean: Truth. Nick Carter: Comfortable. Kevin Richardson: Inspired. CNN: You have a lot of fans -- and a lot of haters out there. What do you say to those that question your cool factor, relevance and place in the music industry? Carter: We never thought we were cool. Richardson: We never claimed to be cool. McLean: We never said that. Carter: We're just guys that love music. Richardson: We love music. We do what we love and have fun and enjoy it, and put out positive vibes and energy. Yeah man, just create! Carter: We worked hard to get where we are now. We busted our asses. It's been 20 years, you know? The grassroots approach starting overseas. Starting in Germany when America didn't want to have any association with us. Littrell: There was no Internet, you know? You couldn't just toss your music up in the air and let it stick somewhere. CNN: Things were very different in the music business 20 years ago. What's been the biggest challenge? Richardson: If you want to have a long career in this industry, it's a given that there will be waves -- highs and lows -- like a boat rocking on the ocean. It goes up and down and up and down. Knowing that and working through it and riding through it is what sustains you. As well as your fans. McLean: We don't ever settle. We always try to set new goals for every album cycle. From the music to the producers to what we actually want to sing about, write about. And keep trying to push the limits of who we are and who we want to keep being and grow into. Backstreet Boys will never settle. CNN: Your first album came out in 1996, but you're calling this your 20-year anniversary. What happened in '93? Richardson: That's when we formed. We got signed in '94, beginning of '95, but the five of us got together in '93. Between when we got together and when we got signed, we went on the road and did a school tour in a van. There are still people who come up to us on the street and say, ""You performed at my elementary school in Pennsylvania when I was 7 years old!"" We didn't play in bars to build our fan base, we played high schools, middle schools, elementary schools. McLean: Grand opening of pet stores! You name it! Richardson: The parking lot of a car dealership. We did it. Wherever we could play and get exposure. Wherever we could sing a cappella and show people that we're not just pretty faces, we actually have talent, we can sing. We sing with passion, we sing with soul and we love to sing. That's what we did. CNN: That was your YouTube back then. Richardson: Yeah, we got discovered via a VHS tape to a record label. Now people are uploading videos on the Internet and that's how they get discovered. CNN: Do you have an opinion about which way is harder? Carter: It's all relative. We're not taking away from people's hard work nowadays, it's just a different world. I can't relate necessarily. I can only say what we've gone through. But, the social media with YouTube and everything, it does give people an opportunity to expose yourself and if you have talent it will come out. I think that's a great thing. If we had had that back then, who knows? Dorough: But it was during that time that we were developing. Richardson: We were growing. We were learning who we are. Carter: I think the fact that we took our time getting around the world, that's one of the other reasons why we're able to be here and have this staying power. Because sometimes the social media, it's so fast, that people get it, but to hold on to it, it isn't there. CNN: Any last words? Richardson: Ultimately, we just want to say that our fans -- number one -- is why we're still here.

"(CNN) -- Jay Lin is the embodiment of the American dream -- and what is increasingly a Chinese dream. Originally from Wenzhou in eastern China, he moved to New York City as a teenager. After earning degrees from Ivy League universities -- Cornell and Columbia -- he secured a comfortable job in a bucolic town in Connecticut. Now he is helping others in China follow his path, where the desire for elite U.S. education is alive and well. In the last decade, mainland Chinese have reshaped the international student body at U.S. colleges and universities, notably at Ivy League institutions. In the 2009-2010 academic year, China surpassed traditional ""study abroad"" heavyweights like Canada, India and South Korea, to lead international enrollment across U.S. higher education, according to the Institute of International Education. The U.S.-based institute's most recent figures reveal that mainland Chinese students increased 23% to more than 723,000 in the 2010-11 academic year. A rising generation of affluent students . While Chinese students traditionally went abroad when they failed to secure a place at a top-tier local university, the best students are now forgoing elite Chinese universities to study in the United States, according to Lin, now academic director of Ivy Labs Education, an admissions consultancy in Beijing. Many Chinese are seeking a higher quality of education that will train them to become independent and creative, he said, and they see the world's top-ranked universities are in the United States. China's economic reforms and ""opening-up"" that began in 1978 under Deng Xiaoping gave rise to the first major generation of students, who were generally reliant on scholarships to study in the United States, according to Chen Shuangye, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Department of Educational Administration and Policy. Coinciding with China's rapid economic growth, a distinctive second generation emerged in the mid-1990s comprising much more affluent students, Chen said. ""There is a great increase in the phenomenon because (mainland Chinese) don't rely on scholarships anymore."" Starting early at boarding schools . The factors driving mainland Chinese to study in the United States come into play much earlier, Lin said, noting an influx of foreign Chinese students into private U.S. secondary schools, starting around 2005. Chinese parents send their children to private U.S. high schools as a ""strategic decision"" to strengthen their candidacy for elite U.S. universities, Lin said. A growing number also want their children to lead happier lives rather than have them consumed by preparing for the ""gaokao"" in China -- the one-time, high-stakes national university entrance examination that is the sole determinant of admission. ""The goal of education in mainland China is to prepare you to take the gaokao. Everything else is secondary. In China, you would put the gaokao in the center...whereas...in American education, you put the student in the center, and everything else serves the best interests of the student. It's not exclusively about (getting into) college."" While U.S. boarding schools desire Chinese students both for their dollars and diversity, they walk a ""very fine line...when it comes to recruiting Chinese students,"" said Lin, who assisted with admissions during his tenure teaching at Connecticut's Cheshire Academy. Boarding schools typically admit four to five students of any foreign nationality per grade level, with international students comprising up to 20% of the overall student body, Lin said. With about 100 students for each of the four grade levels, this means admitting a maximum of 20 mainland Chinese, or five percent of the student body. ""A school could easily fill itself with all Chinese students, but no school's going to do that...It's a double-edged sword -- if you have too many Chinese, then the Chinese will stop coming to your school, and also, Americans will stop coming to your school."" Driving international enrollment at U.S. universities . By virtue of their size, U.S. universities can accept a much higher number of Chinese students than boarding schools. Since 1999, China was the second leading place of origin for international students at Harvard, trailing only Canada. Its student numbers steadily increased to lead Harvard's international enrollment since the last academic year, with 686 students currently enrolled (nearly 16% of the international student body.) China similarly dominates international enrollment at other Ivy League schools, including Yale and Princeton. ""International students are seen very favorably as whole, as a way to diversify and really become a global institution,"" said Rachel Rubin, a lecturer at Boston's Emmanuel College and a specialist in higher education admissions policy. ""Also economically -- it's very advantageous for elite schools to admit international students because the bulk of them can pay full tuition,"" she added. As such, there is ""a lot of favoritism"" toward such students, as financial aid budgets have been cut over the last decade, she said. Limits to international enrollment at U.S. universities . But while mainland Chinese students dominate international enrollment, they comprise a small fraction of the overall student body. This is even more the case at the undergraduate level, as most international students are graduates. Harvard has ""no quotas or limits for international students,"" according to Harvard spokesperson Kevin Galvin. ""All students are considered in the same pool for all places in the incoming class, regardless of citizenship or the school they attend."" Rubin said she has not come across evidence of undergraduate quotas for international students but found it was standard practice for top-ranked schools to assess them as a separate pool rather than with the entire pool of applicants. Some U.S. colleges and universities aim to recruit an undergraduate cohort with around 10% international students, according to Susan Joan Mauriello, founder of the Hong-Kong-based ApplyIvy consultancy, adding that the percentage depends on the strength of the applicant pool. Bringing U.S. education to China . As U.S. campuses cannot fully support the demand from China, Lin sees an opportunity in bringing international education to China, beginning at the secondary level. The trend can already be seen in U.S. universities establishing local degree-granting branches. Next September, New York University will welcome its first undergraduate cohort at its new Shanghai campus. ""Instead of sending Chinese students to secondary schools in America or other foreign countries, we want to bring international curriculum into China so they don't need to travel outside the country,"" Lin said. He helps local high schools incorporate international systems, such as the International Baccalaureate and A-Levels, alongside Chinese curriculum. Students at these ""Chinese versions of international schools"" are typically Chinese nationals, who are restricted by government policy from attending full-fledged international schools, which cater to expatriates. ""My dream is to see international schools in China accessible to Chinese citizens and other nationalities together in the same school,"" Lin said. ""That's the future.""","Mainland China has led international enrollment in U.S. higher education since 2009 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Someone stole an ""incomplete and early version"" of the next installment in the blockbuster ""X-Men"" movie series and posted it on the Internet this week, according to the studio that owns the billion-dollar film franchise. Hugh Jackman stars in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" An early version of the film was leaked to the Web. Twentieth Century Fox said the FBI was investigating who leaked ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which is set for release in U.S. theaters May 1. The digital file quickly spread across the Internet and was available for free, but illegal, downloading from hundreds of easily found Web sites. ""The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law; the courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts in the past,"" the studio's statement said.  Watch how the leak might affect ticket sales » . Removing the pirated files from the Internet may prove an impossible challenge, an industry source said. This source did not want to be named because of the sensitive nature of the matter. Although the studio said it was removed from the Web site that first hosted it, the digital file has probably been downloaded tens of thousands of times, the source said. ""It's not removed from the Internet,"" the industry source said. ""It's still there."" Twentieth Century Fox downplayed the value of the pirated copy, noting that it was not the final version. ""It was without many effects, had missing and unedited scenes and temporary sound and music,"" the studio said. Online movie reviewer Kent Lundblad said he was given a copy by a friend just hours after the rough ""Wolverine"" first appeared on a Web site Tuesday afternoon. ""Even in this rough form, it's much better than the last 'X-Men' outing or anything Fox has given us in a long, long time,"" Lundblad said in a review he wrote after watching it. He said the movie is a rough cut, using placeholder images in many sections and special effects that look like ""video games 12 years ago."" He said he suspects that the final movie will look much different than the pirated version, with scenes that were re-shot. Lundblad, a 25-year-old who describes himself as ""a total nerd,"" said he will see the movie at its midnight premiere May 1. He bought his ticket weeks ago online, he said. Steve Zeitchik, who covers the film industry for The Hollywood Reporter, said the studio's biggest concern may be that having people view a rough cut ""completely throws the studios off their game"" of building a positive buzz for the movie. ""If people see this movie, and they don't like it, and they tell their friends, and their friends blog about it, and it just spreads throughout the blogosphere, there are a lot of people that don't even get near a pirated copy of this film, who don't go see [the movie in theaters] because of this leak,"" Zeitchik said. Whether the leaked video will eventually hurt the film's box office earnings ""is very difficult to discern,"" according to CNN's source. The latest ""X-Men"" film stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Investigators have several tools to help find the source of the leak, including digital watermarking, the studio said. ""We forensically mark our content so we can identify sources that make it available or download it,"" the studio said. An FBI spokeswoman confirmed that the agency is ""working with the studio and investigating the alleged online compromise of the movie."" The Motion Picture Association of America, the film industry's main trade association, confirmed it was also helping in the probe.","NEW: Online reviewer saw early ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" praises film .

"(CNN) -- Think back to that prehistoric era before the internet existed. Around this time every year the dreadful reality of Christmas shopping would dawn: you would soon have no choice but to face the music and that music would be none other than a hypnotic rendition of Jingle Bells following you into every store, turning you into yet another mall zombie like the rest of them. Today, with the modern miracle that is e-commerce, most of us buy many of our gifts via computer without a single festive melody or human interaction. It may be a welcome modernization for consumers, but does it take a little magic out of the whole experience? Now, with an innovative new hybrid shopping concept, we'll be able to enjoy aspects of both worlds. This season sees the advent of 'digital storefronts', giant touchscreen store windows where customers can browse through a retailer's items with a single swipe. Once they find something they can hit the 'order' button and a link will be sent to their mobile phone, allowing them to pay through PayPal or with a credit or debit card. ""(It) brings the best of online and new technologies to the physical world,"" says Steve Yankovich, vice president of innovation and new ventures at eBay, who have recently partnered with retail experience firm Westfield Labs to launch a series of digital storefronts at the Westfield San Francisco Center. Retailers Sony, TOMS and Rebecca Minkoff have all set up 'Connected Glass' points in the mall, which provide customers with a virtual shop within a real mall. Of the three, only Sony has a physical outlet there. ""The Digital Storefronts in Westfield San Francisco Centre are a great alternative to empty spaces in the mall. The opportunity is for brands to expand their footprint by offering vertical shopping experiences. Connected glass doesn't require a square footage retail space. Therefore, it allows retailers to have a presence in areas with heavy foot traffic, where a square footage retail space wouldn't be possible or affordable,"" said Yankovich. Of course, with digital storefronts you still have to make the time to visit, but once you do you get all the benefits of quick browsing and purchasing that are often lacking in a traditional store. This way, shoppers can scroll through goods and have them sent to a pick-up point or delivered to their door, mostly with free delivery and in some cases on the same day. New York design outfit Kate Spade also recently collaborated with the online retailer, to connect their digital storefront to an option similar to eBay's same day delivery service, eBay Now, which delivers items in about an hour from the time of purchase. The company's 'Connected Glass' technology could be widely installed on unused surfaces in the future, particularly in busy airports and train stations. Monday this week was 'Green Monday,' normally eBay's busiest sales day of the year.","eBay introduces digital storefronts that converge online and offline shopping .

"(CNN) -- You pull yourself out of bed, bring your coffee to the front porch, and there, right in front of you, is the vast expanse of the Grand Canyon. That's the appeal of staying at El Tovar, which has graced the rim of the canyon since 1905. But it's hardly alone; you'll find great national park lodges all over the U.S. and Canada. And staying at one doesn't mean camping and freeze-dried dinners. The best lodges offer gourmet food, personalized service and rustic yet often elegant interiors. See more of the best national park lodges . Many are landmarks dating back to the park system's early days. In 1903, officials at the Northern Pacific Railroad were inspired to create a lodge with local logs and stone. The result, Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone National Park, has a towering lobby that became a model for national park architecture. Travel + Leisure: America's most underrated national parks . From Hawaii Volcanoes National Park to Alaska's Glacier Bay, these historic lodges deliver location and creature comforts. Many Glacier Hotel, Glacier National Park, Montana . Evening glacier tours are, naturally, one of the popular activities during a stay here. Surrounded by the Rocky Mountains, the hotel feels like a Swiss chalet, with windows opening to Swiftcurrent Lake and a dramatic lobby with tree trunks as the support poles. Opt for a suite with lake view and balcony, or a refurbished lakeside room. Then go outside and fly-fish in a setting that will soothe your soul, or take the ferry across the lake and hike to Grinnell Glacier. The Ahwahnee, Yosemite National Park, California . Art Deco, Native American, Middle Eastern and Arts and Crafts influences all contributed to this 1927 landmark's design. More recently, a renovation drew upon Yosemite's historical archives to determine appropriate textiles and colors, giving an English country-house look to the interiors -- rich tapestries, stained glass and hand-stenciled beams. The most elaborate rooms feature balconies and views of Glacier Point, Yosemite Falls or Half Dome. After a day in the great outdoors, take your complimentary afternoon tea on the patio overlooking Glacier Point. Glacier Bay's Bear Track Inn, Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska . Yes, you really can see black bears and moose from your bedroom at this gateway to Glacier Bay National Park. Guests praise the personal service -- look for appetizers and homemade cookies each afternoon -- and innkeepers can help arrange excursions from watching humpback whales to taking a dogsled ride. Ice climbing, fresh- and salt-water fishing, guided kayak trips, and visits to Admiralty Island to view brown bears are also popular. On your return, sink into the suede sofas and warm yourself by the lobby fireplace. Travel + Leisure: America's best national park views . Greyfield Inn, Cumberland Island National Seashore, Georgia . If an island with wild horses doesn't sound romantic enough, consider that secluded 16-room Greyfield -- the only inn on the island -- was the choice of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette for their 1996 wedding party. The former home is exuberantly southern, with a sprawling front porch, extensive gardens, and homegrown collards and kale on its locally sourced menu. The all-inclusive price includes everything you need to have a good time: three daily meals, bikes, kayaks, fishing equipment, beach gear and excursions with a naturalist to spot birds and wildlife. Sun yourself on 18 miles of wide beaches, or stroll through the exotic terrain of a maritime forest. Crater Lake Lodge, Crater Lake National Park, Oregon . Oregon may not bring to mind images of volcanoes, but the state has an explosive past. Crater Lake Lodge is positioned right at the end of a caldera (or huge crater) formed by the collapse of an ancient volcano. The upheaval produced lava walls stretching 2,000 feet high and the nation's deepest lake, an exquisitely clear, jewel-toned blue. You can learn about the park's geology on boat tours that run from late June to mid-September. At the lodge, ask for a lakeside guest room for the best views. Alta Crystal Resort, Mount Rainier National Park, Washington . Alta Crystal Resort lies just outside the northeast entrance to the park, giving it the closest proximity to Sunrise, the area's highest point. Each of Alta Crystal's 23 renovated suites has a fireplace and a small but fully equipped kitchen. An arched log entry and handmade doors enhance the appeal of the two-story honeymoon cabin. The pool and hot tub stay heated year round, and you can join the resort's bonfires, barbecues, and other nightly events in July and August (on weekends in other months). Zion Lodge, Zion National Park, Utah . This is the only lodging option that puts you inside Zion National Park. Western-style 1920s cabins combine fir flooring and oak-and-wicker dressers with modern amenities like 300-thread-count cotton sheets. Another 82 guest rooms and suites include private porches or balconies. A 100-foot-high cottonwood tree marks the front lawn, which has a great vantage point for stargazing. The lodge does its part to be a good park tenant. Cabin rooms include an on-demand water heater and LED lighting, and suites have filtered drinking water faucets (no water bottles are sold on site). A recent redesign of the restaurant's walk-in coolers will save a million gallons of water a year. Travel + Leisure: Best national parks for wildlife spotting . El Tovar, Grand Canyon, Arizona . Built on the rim of the Grand Canyon in 1905, El Tovar was once so far from civilization that fresh water had to be delivered by train. It's since become one of our greatest national park treasures, with plenty of civilized touches, including suites with sitting rooms. Bring your morning coffee out to the front porch or lounge deck and gaze at the play of light on the canyon. Then head back inside for a hearty breakfast of Sonoran Eggs, with beans, chorizo, an array of salsas, and fry bread. Jenny Lake Lodge, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming . Authentic log walls, handmade quilts, and down comforters make nights cozy in the cabins here at the base of the Tetons. The inclusive room rates cover breakfast and a five-course dinner daily, plus horseback rides, bike rentals, and the joy of having a front porch in one of the nation's most photographed mountain ranges. As part of a new sustainability effort, rooms have high-efficiency lighting and recycled carpet, and guests earn a $10 credit each day they decline laundry services. Volcano House, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii . Closed for several years, Volcano House reopened in 2013 following a $7 million renovation that preserved the character of architect Charles Dickey's original 1941 design. Talk about a view: some rooms overlook Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, while others face native Hawaiian rainforest of ohia lehua and koa trees, accented by tall hapuu tree ferns. Watching the crimson-feathered apapane fly from branch to branch while Halema'uma'u Crater erupts about two miles away is an otherworldly sensation. Even the fireplace in the hotel's Grand Lounge is made of lava rock. See more national park lodges . Planning a getaway? Don't miss Travel + Leisure's guide to the World's Best Hotels .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- The sign language interpreter widely ridiculed for his performance at the Nelson Mandela memorial stands by his work. Thamsanqa Jantjie said Thursday that he is a fully qualified interpreter and has been trusted in the past with other big events. ""It has been many years I have been doing this job"" he told CNN. ""My portfolio shows that I have been a champion of what I have been doing."" Not so, says the head of the South Africa Translators' Institute. There were complaints last year after Jantjie interpreted the proceedings at the ruling African National Congress elective conference, the institute's chairman, Johan Blaauw, told the South African Press Association. But Jantjie stands by his work. ""I have never in my life had anything that said I have interpreted wrong,"" he said. ""For the deaf association, if they think that I have done a wrong interpretation, I ask forgiveness. For Deaf SA, if they are telling me that I was doing a wrong interpretation, then they should answer me why they were silent all the time, all these years,"" he said, referring to the Deaf Federation of South Africa, which has criticized his work at the service. Jantjie declined to provide details about his hire for the four-hour memorial, watched by millions around the world, as a government inquiry looks into the matter. He said he had been drawn to the job of interpreting because he was disabled. ""I am suffering from schizophrenia, which is controllable. I am under treatment,"" Jantjie said. At a news conference Thursday, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, South Africa's deputy minister of women, children and people with disabilities, admitted that mistakes had happened at the memorial service but added that Jantjie was not a ""fake."" She said there was no sign language standard in South Africa and deaf people spoke different dialects. She added that the government was looking into the vetting of Jantjie's security clearance at the memorial. ""But normally when you do provide a service at a particular level, you will be vetted. And as you could see, he had his accreditation, so he didn't just walk through,"" she said. Sign educators on Mandela interpreter . Questions grow . Bogopane-Zulu also said the government tracked down the company Jantjie worked for, but the owners ""seemed to have vanished."" ""We managed to get hold of them and then we spoke to them, wanting some answers, and they vanished into thin air,"" she said. ""They have been providing substandard service for years."" Jantjie named his employer as a company called SA Interpreters. He did not give details about his training, saying his qualifications are filed with the company. ""You can look at my portfolio, it speaks for itself from the events that I have done in my country,"" he said. As outrage over his interpretation skills have grown, so have questions about who hired him. The ANC said it did not hire Jantjie for the service, as it was the state that had organized the memorial. ""The processes that were followed to procure Mr. Jantjie's services were thus government processes and not ANC processes,"" the ruling party said in a prepared statement, adding that it had used his services before. ""It is important to make the point that, up until yesterday, the African National Congress had not been aware of any of complaints regarding the quality of services, qualifications or reported illnesses of Mr Jantjie."" Interpreter at Mandela memorial a fake, group says . 'A dream come true' Jantjie said he was proud to receive a call saying he would be interpreting at the memorial for the revered statesman, who died last week at age 95. Asked who had called him to tell him he would be interpreting, he just said: ""It is a lady that I am serving under."" He said the atmosphere on the day was ""wonderful."" ""It was a dream come true,"" he said, adding that he felt as if he had reached ""the standard of the champion of the whole world."" At the service, at which world leaders from President Barack Obama to Cuba's Raul Castro spoke, he said he was doing South African sign language. 'Fake interpreter' But the national director of the Deaf Federation of South Africa sees it differently. He said Jantjie had been dubbed a ""fake interpreter."" ""The deaf community is in outrage,"" said Bruno Druchen. ""He is not known by the Deaf Community in South Africa nor by the South African Sign Language interpreters working in the field."" The man showed no facial expressions, which are key in South African sign language, and his hand signals were meaningless, Druchen said. ""It is a total mockery of the language,"" he added. While dignitaries addressed the crowd at Johannesburg's FNB stadium, Jantjie produced a series of hand signals that experts said meant nothing. ""It was almost like he was doing baseball signs,"" deaf actress Marlee Matlin told CNN on Wednesday, through a sign language interpreter. ""I was appalled."" Though each country has its own sign language, all of them entail facial expressions, she said. She called his lack of facial expression ""a giveaway."" ""I knew exactly right then and there that he wasn't authentic at all, and it was offensive; it was offensive to me."" Marlee Matlin: I knew interpreter was fake . CNN's Ed Payne and Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","Interpreter Thamsanqa Jantjie tells CNN that his portfolio ""speaks for itself""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Mississippi are holding a father of five in the deaths of his children, ages 1 to 8, the state's Department of Public Safety said Tuesday evening. ""The seriousness of this violent crime is unconscionable,"" said Albert Santa Cruz, Mississippi's public safety commissioner. Timothy Jones Jr., 32, is being held in Smith County on child endangerment charges and is awaiting extradition to South Carolina for prosecution. The children, reported missing from South Carolina last week, were found dead in Alabama on Tuesday, authorities said. Their remains were discovered off a dirt road in Wilcox County, said Sgt. Steve Jarrett of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Jones led law enforcement to the crime scene, Jarrett said. No other details were immediately available about how the children died. A multi-state search for the children and their father involved the FBI and state law enforcement agencies. It was launched after the mother told Lexington County, South Carolina, sheriff's investigators on September 3 that she has been unable to contact her former husband. ""Neighbors told deputies that the children's father said he was moving with his children from his home near Lexington to another state,"" said Lexington Sheriff Lewis McCarty. Jones and the children's mother were divorced. They shared custody of the children, according to the Lexington County, South Carolina, Sheriff's office. On Saturday, Jones was taken into custody in Mississippi on suspicion of driving under the influence. When his SUV was towed, authorities found evidence of a crime, the state's Department of Public Safety said. A check of the National Criminal Information Center found he was wanted in South Carolina.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- For more than a decade, Robin Emmons felt helpless as her older brother lived on the streets, eating out of garbage cans. She tried repeatedly to get him help for his mental illness, but authorities told her there was nothing they could do. After he was arrested in 2008 for damaging someone's car during a schizophrenic outburst, she was finally able to become his legal guardian and get him into a halfway house with psychiatric services. But as she watched his mental health improve, she noticed his physical health getting worse. ""I learned that he was becoming borderline diabetic,"" she said. ""He wasn't like that even when he was homeless."" She investigated and found out that the nonprofit facility was mainly feeding him packaged and canned foods because it couldn't afford fresh fruits and vegetables. ""I had a small garden, so I thought, 'Well, I'll just put in some extra rows,' "" Emmons said. ""I began making weekly deliveries of whatever was coming up."" She soon realized, however, that the problem extended well beyond her brother's transitional home. While farmers markets were springing up across the city, she noticed that low-income and working-class neighborhoods had few grocery stores or places to buy fresh produce. ""If you don't live in an affluent part of the city ... your easiest options are the dollar menu or the convenience store attached to a gas station,"" said Emmons, 45. For residents who lacked transportation, buying healthy food was even more difficult. ""It might be a trek, or they might have to borrow a car or get on a bus,"" Emmons said. ""Often, once they get there, they are paying a very high price for the food."" A recent study from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte confirmed her impressions. It showed that more than 72,000 low-income city residents, many of them minorities, lived in ""food deserts"" -- areas without a supermarket with fresh food nearby. They also faced a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death. Access to fresh food is an issue for many communities throughout the United States. According to the Department of Agriculture, nearly 10% of the U.S. population lives in low-income areas more than a mile from a supermarket. Discovering this problem sparked something inside Emmons, who had recently left her corporate job to find more meaningful work. ""I really thought it was an injustice. ... Healthy food is a basic human right,"" she said. ""I decided to rip up my whole backyard and make it all a garden, and it just kind of snowballed from there."" Today, Emmons has 200 volunteers helping her tend 9 acres of crops on three sites. Since 2008, she says, her nonprofit, Sow Much Good, has grown more than 26,000 pounds of fresh produce for underserved communities in Charlotte. At first, Emmons donated her locally grown, chemical-free fruits and vegetables to churches and food pantries. But she soon started selling them herself in the neighborhoods that need them the most, for what she estimates is about half the price of organic produce sold in stores. With her 1,000-kilowatt smile and boundless energy, some might call Emmons a goodwill ambassador for healthy eating. She'd claim that her produce -- from cucumbers and okra to watermelon and blueberries -- can sell itself, but her enthusiasm certainly doesn't hurt. ""Everyone's been excited about the string beans,"" she says to one customer. ""How are you going make yours?"" She strives to make her food as affordable as possible. People are also able to use their food stamps to purchase anything she sells, including seeds and seedlings so they can grow the food themselves. Emmons and her volunteers distribute recipe cards, too, and urge customers to attend the group's free cooking demonstrations and canning classes. It's all part of their mission to help people take control over what they are eating and improve their health. And customers seem hungry for all that Emmons and her group are offering. ""We've been really, really thrilled about the response from the community,"" Emmons said. ""Even as early as January of this year, they were calling, asking, 'When are you coming back out?' "" Brandy Bolin says she was a junk-food junkie for much of her life, until she was diagnosed with diabetes six months ago. She immediately vowed to make eating healthy a priority for herself and her 11-year-old daughter. But because she is unemployed, waiting for her disability to come through, it hasn't always been easy. ""We try to eat the best we can, but we often have to cut corners,"" said Bolin, 38. ""Sometimes, that means picking the $1.49 mac and cheese over $5 worth of vegetables."" Since Bolin discovered Emmons' produce stand this summer, she has visited nearly every time it's been open. ""I couldn't believe all the beautiful, fresh vegetables, and the price that she was charging was phenomenal,"" Bolin said. ""It's making me and my family healthier."" Keeping this enterprise going is a labor of love for Emmons, who spent years doing it for free before recently taking a small salary. But she said the work has reconnected her to ideals and interests she's had her entire life. Emmons didn't have a lot of money growing up in Boston, but her parents often drove 30 miles to make sure the family had fruits and vegetables. That commitment to healthy eating carried over to adulthood, when she started gardening in Charlotte. ""There was lots of trial and error,"" she said. ""But I was fascinated with the miracle of watching seed drop into the ground and see it flower and grow fruit. It was satisfying."" Emmons also has become a certified beekeeper, so local honey is now available at her stand. And her new CSA initiative -- Community Supported Agriculture -- delivers boxes of fresh produce to families every week. She has attracted local support for her nonprofit, including a local farmer who taught her to drive a tractor and lets her grow food on his land. In August, she opened a permanent farm stand on land donated by North Carolina-based corporation Martin Marietta, and she plans to open an educational center there where she can hold classes and events that promote a healthy lifestyle. Eventually, Emmons would love to expand her organization across the country, combating food deserts wherever they exist. For now, she's devoted to helping Charlotte residents. ""When I see people coming to the farm stand ... I feel encouraged,"" she said. ""I feel like I am giving them a gift -- a healthier, longer, better, more delicious life."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- The CEO of Levis Strauss, Chip Bergh, has some advice for you: Don't wash your jeans. As in don't wash them ... ever. Speaking at Fortune's Brainstorm Green conference, Chip said he was sporting a pair that had ""yet to see a washing machine"" in over a year. Worried about germs, you germaphobes? No problem, he says. Just stick your jeans in the freezer once a month next to the frozen waffles to kill off the bacteria. Apparently getting them icy will neutralize the sweat, coffee spills and other bodily fluids that might collect in the zipper or ""seating"" area. He also suggests spot cleaning with a sponge or a toothbrush. While that could work for the stuff on the outside of your jeans, what about all the stuff your body cooked up that's on the flip side? Once you get 'em back up to body temperature, won't you be warming up those germs again? Yuck. Jean freezing has become quite the craze in the past few years. It even comes with its own video tutorials and folding techniques posted online by bloggers around the country. Interesting, but somehow I doubt an overnight stay in the freezer is going to silence the filth festival that accumulates on a pair of jeans over the course of wearing them for 30 days straight. The only time I tried jean freezing was during a family fishing trip a few years ago in the Wind River Range. We ""washed"" a load in the river and hung a line up for our laundry to dry overnight. I woke up to unexpected frost and a pair of Carhartts that felt like plywood. If you think it's hard to pull on your jeggings, ladies, try cracking open a pair of jeans that are frozen solid. Bergh claims that not washing your jeans keeps them in mint condition and helps conserve water. Both noble pursuits. But what about conserving the cleanliness of your lower extremities and not subjecting your colleagues to the stench of dirty denim? Have you ever cooked bacon or mucked a stall in a pair of jeans? It's a gift that keeps on giving. And with this thought, it has dawned on me. He's not talking to people like my Uncle Warren, who rise with the sun to work the Angus cattle farm that's been in my family for generations. He's talking to people who like to look fancy in their jeans. The people that benefit most from not washing denim are the ones who'll throw down what is for many Americans a monthly salary to buy something they'll never wash, because, quite frankly, they'll probably be worn no more than four times before their next new pair of jeans. And listen, science says this ""freezing jean"" phenomena doesn't stand up to analysis. In plain English: No, freezing your jeans will not kill all bacteria, but throwing them in the microwave just might. Stephen Craig Cary, a University of Delaware expert on frozen microbes suggests ""you either raise the temperature to 121 degrees Celsius for at least 10 minutes or just wash them! The latter surely is the best alternative to save energy."" He adds: ""One might think that if the temperature drops well below the human body temperature they (bacteria) will not survive, but actually many will. Many are pre-adapted to survive low temperatures."" Then again, since much of a CEO's job is to drum up as much marketing buzz as possible, it's no wonder that Bergh is making this unsanitary claim -- thereby bringing Levi's back to the forefront of a conversation. Even if it makes him smell like a farm animal.","Mel Robbins: Levi's CEO says save water, don't wash your jeans, freeze them to freshen .
Robbins: That's gross .
She says science doesn't support this, even though there's lots of online info on how to do it .

"Washington (CNN) -- Over the next few days, the drama of a potential government shutdown will collide with the promise of a new health insurance system known as Obamacare. Here are answers to eight of the most pressing questions about both: . 1. What happens on October 1 with Obamacare and the government shutdown? First, the health insurance exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act -- or Obamacare -- will be open for business. Millions of uninsured Americans will be able to enroll in health plans before the law kicks in on January 1, 2014. Second, the U.S. government might ""shut down"" if lawmakers can't agree to pass a funding bill that has attached to it a provision to defund Obamacare. These two events are linked. The reason both houses of Congress may not be able to agree on a funding bill -- also known as a continuing resolution -- is that some senators and representatives see this as their last chance to stop Obamacare. But that's really where the link ends. Shutdown showdown over Obamacare moves to Senate . 2. Does a government shutdown shut down Obamacare? Not really. Most of the funding for Obamacare comes from new taxes and fees, from cost cuts to other programs like Medicare and other types of funding that carry on even in the event of a government shutdown. Congress' research arm, the Congressional Research service, prepared a memo for Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, that suggested an effort to use the government shutdown as leverage to force Democrats to delay implementing the law would not really work because the law will continue regardless of a shutdown. Plus, the law would still be in effect, so its many new requirements -- everything from forcing insurance companies to cover anyone who wants insurance to forcing everyday Americans to carry health insurance or pay a fine -- would still be in effect, too. Government shutdown: Again? Seriously? 3. Do I have to sign up for a new health insurance plan on October 1 when open enrollment for Obamacare begins? Maybe -- Take this quick survey and we'll find out: . A. Do you get health insurance from your employer? If the answer is yes -- and this is by far the No. 1 way Americans get health insurance -- go on about your business. Obamacare doesn't really affect you. At least not yet. A lot of people think that because of Obamacare, fewer companies will offer health insurance, particularly to low-paid workers and retirees. There is some evidence of this. These employers would have to pay a per-worker fine to the government, but it might be cheaper for them in the long run to pay this fine to the government rather than offer insurance. Other companies might cut hours for some workers, making them part-timers working fewer than 30 hours a week in order to avoid helping pay their health insurance. But it will take some years to see if it really comes to pass. However, if you get health insurance at work, you could probably drop that coverage and buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. But you might not want to. You won't qualify for any government help to buy your insurance and your employer wouldn't be contributing any of the money it is now. B. Do you get health insurance from the government? If the answer is yes, go on about your business. Obamacare doesn't really affect you. At least not yet. While Obamacare relies on making Medicare more efficient as a way to pay for some new services for younger people, it is not supposed to change the services offered by Medicare. One big test of this promise is Medicare Advantage. These are privately administered insurance plans that provide Medicare services to seniors. They cost the government more per person to provide Medicare. So, Obamacare seeks to bring their spending back in line with the rest of Medicare. This could lead to changes in Medicare Advantage options, like gym memberships and other items that are offered as enticements. But the same core Medicare services are supposed to remain in effect. The same goes for Medicaid. If you get your insurance from one of the 50 state-run Medicaid programs, Obamacare should not affect you. But you'll have a lot more company in these programs, which will grow to insure a larger portion of Americans. Zelizer: GOP strategy on shutdown courts doom . 4. Do you have an individual health insurance plan? If yes, Obamacare is going to affect you. It is possible that your insurance plan won't change, but it's just as likely that your plan doesn't meet all the minimum requirements the law imposes. These include new rules for how much profit companies can take for plans, new rules for coverage of women's services, new rules for how much more insurance companies can charge for women than men, and a lot more. So, you might have to buy a more expensive plan. In this case, your insurance company has probably already let you know. It's also possible you might want a new plan. Check out your new state health insurance exchange or the one the federal government set up in your state if your state government refused to do so. People who like and dislike Obamacare have something to like about costs of individual plans. Prelminary estimates have come in lower than some government prognosticators expected. So it is fair to say Obamacare might be cheaper than expected for some individuals. But it is also accurate to say that premiums are likely to rise for healthy people on the individual market. Why? They're going to get more robust insurance plans that cover more things. At the same time, a lot of sick people who get private insurance now pay a ton for it; their costs could decrease. Congress: will it be a government shutdown or budget compromise? 5. Do you have no health insurance? If so, Obamacare is for you, like it or not. You're either going to have to enroll in Medicaid or buy health insurance from a private company on an ""exchange"" organized by either your state government or the federal government. If you're single and you make less than $15,281.70 ($31,321.50 for a family of four), you're likely to get Medicaid, although some states have refused to expand their programs. Those income levels for Medicaid -- 133% of the federal poverty level -- will increase from year to year. 10 ways a government shutdown would affect your daily life . 6. How much is Obamacare going to cost me? It depends. What if you make more than $15,281.70, but not that much more? You don't get Medcaid. You don't have employer-sponsored health insurance and you do want coverage. How are you supposed to afford a new health insurance plan? The government is going to help a lot of people pay for it. If you're single and you make less than $45,960 ($94,200 for a family of four), you'll qualify for a government-sponsored subsidy to help you buy insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated the average government subsidy for a family will be about $2,700 and the average premium costs will be about $8,250. Those costs will vary depending on the age and number of family members and the level of plan they choose to buy. Try your own scenario here. Q&A: The lowdown on the shutdown, or why you should care about the CR . 7. Is Obamacare health insurance government insurance? No. Many state Medicaid programs will grow to insure much larger portions of their state populations. But the core of the law is the creation of new health insurance exchanges. These are places -- online, mostly -- where people who don't get insurance can buy it from a private company. On the one hand, the government is making people either carry insurance or pay a fine, on the other hand the government is making insurance companies provide insurance to anyone who wants it and they're controlling how much the insurance companies can charge. 8. What happens if I don't buy health insurance? You're young and healthy. You don't really want health insurance. No sweat. You don't have to buy it. You can ""opt out."" But then you'll have to pay a fine of between $95 for every adult in your house or 1% of your income after $10,000, whichever is larger. So if you're single and you make $50,000, you'd have to pay a $400 fine for not having health insurance. The Supreme Court called this fine a tax. You can look at it that way. Or you can view it as an upfront payment for having hospital and ambulance services able to come get you if you need them. Or you can look at it as horrible government overreach. Some people do. 5 strange things about debt ceilings .","The federal government is headed for a potential shutdown .

"(CNN) -- Skype released a new version of the telephony application for iPhone, which adds video-chat features that go beyond what Apple offers. With the Skype app released on Wednesday, owners of the iPhone 4 and the older 3GS model can make video calls over AT&T's 3G network. Since the 3GS only has a camera on the back, using it for video conversations is less than ideal. Apple's own FaceTime video-chat feature, which comes with the iPhone 4 and new iPod Touch gadgets, cannot make calls over AT&T's network, only on Wi-Fi. Apple said carriers requested time to upgrade their networks to handle the traffic load of video calling. Mobile FaceTime users can call Mac computers that have Apple's beta program installed, which is available on Apple's website. Skype app users can call both Mac and Windows computers that have the Skype software installed. In addition to 3G video and voice calling, the Skype app can also call over a Wi-Fi connection. The iPad and previous iPod Touch model can receive video calls but cannot transmit video because they don't have cameras. CNN tested the iPhone app on Wednesday night, after it appeared on the App Store. Video quality isn't as sharp compared to FaceTime, but like FaceTime, the app recognizes when it's held in portrait or landscape mode. Speculation about Skype adding video features had begun to spread this week, with some reports suggesting the feature would be the focus of the company's press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show next week. Skype's Android app doesn't yet support video calling, but other app developers have found workarounds. The Skype servers suffered a lengthy outage a week ago, which the company blamed on buggy software. Skype has been briefing news reporters on the iPhone app announcement, which it is scheduled to make at 2 a.m. ET Thursday.","Skype adds video-chat feature to its Apple iOS app .

"(CNN) -- A man who wrote a controversial book considered a ""how-to"" guide for pedophiles was booked into a Florida jail Tuesday after defending his book to reporters. Phillip Greaves, who was arrested Monday in Colorado, said ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of Conduct"" can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles, and -- instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest -- teaches them to avoid illegal actions. Asked if he is a pedophile, Greaves said, ""I only have sex with grown-ups."" He said he has no children and ""I don't keep children around my house."" Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd has said his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation, buying the book through the mail. Greaves protested Tuesday he is the target of entrapment, but Judd disagreed. ""He wrote this book, he published this book, he put it on Amazon to sell,"" Judd told reporters as Greaves was booked into the Polk County Jail, ""and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it."" Greaves and his book gained national attention this year after Amazon.com defended selling the book despite angry comments and threats of boycotts. The book was removed from the website in November. Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children, grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents. Judd said Greaves' book outlines a ""code of ethics"" that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children. Greaves told reporters Tuesday he wrote the book to exorcise his own childhood. He said he was introduced to sex at age 7 by a 10-year-old friend and began having sex with other children. It continued, he said, until he was about 15 when he stopped and did not have sex again for years. ""Once I got into adolescence, I suppose you could have identified me as an adolescent pedophile,"" he said. But now, he said, he is an example of the fact that people can reform. ""I think all speech should be protected,"" Greaves said. But ""I was not the one who solicited the material to be sent to Florida. I think Florida law is for Floridians and Colorado law is for Coloradoans."" He told reporters he will not be able to make bond: ""I'm actually quite poor."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on CNN's ""360°"" on Monday night that prosecutors may have a hard time convicting Greaves and maintained his arrest was unconstitutional. ""I don't think they can go forward because the book is clearly protected by the First Amendment,"" Toobin said. ""This book, as awful as it is, it is only words."" Judd vehemently disagreed with Toobin's assessment of the case. ""This has nothing to do with free speech and everything to do with obscenity,"" Judd said. ""We had a law in Florida that applied. We only needed jurisdiction."" He said the book violates Florida law. ""There's too much hand-wringing across the nation. When we can't stand together as a nation and say you can't write a book with real stories of children being sexually abused, then it's time to change the law."" Judd said of Greaves: ""Clearly, in our opinion, he's a pedophile. ... The guy is clearly trying to instruct people how to sexually abuse children, a step-by-step instruction guide with real-life examples. That's against the obscenity law in Florida, and we're excited to take it to court."" Referring to Toobin's comments about the book being just words, he said, ""Words become actions, and words in and of themselves can get you in trouble. If you threaten the president, you're in trouble. ... There are limits to what you can do."" He said prosecutors and a circuit judge signed off on the arrest. Toobin pointed to a similar case that went to the Supreme Court in 2002 in which cartoons depicting children in acts similar to ones in Greaves' book were deemed protected by the Constitution. ""Certainly the sheriff and I disagree about the constitutional issue, but I agree with him that the issue of child pornography is a very serious one, and I'm certainly glad that law enforcement is taking an active stand against it,"" Toobin said.","NEW: Phillip Greaves defends his book to reporters .

"Washington (CNN) -- A legal group filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit on Monday asking that videotapes showing the interrogation of a terror detainee at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, be made public. The suit filed in the Southern District of New York is focused on interrogation techniques used on Mohammed al-Qahtani, a man U.S. authorities have said was intended to be the 20th hijacker in the 9/11 terror attacks. ""From 2002 through 2003, Mr. al-Qahtani was the victim of a deliberate and calculated interrogation strategy involving the repeated use of torture and other profoundly cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment,"" according to the lawsuit filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights. The lawsuit says al-Qahtani was subjected to severe sleep deprivation, isolation, 20-hour interrogations, severe temperatures and forced nudity. The suit says al-Qahtani also experienced ""religious, sexual, and moral humiliation"" including instances in which female interrogators straddled him. The lawsuit was brought against the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI and CIA. Representatives for those agencies declined to comment. During a conference call with reporters, the center said lawyers involved with the case had seen some videotapes of al-Qahtani as the result of a 2009 federal court ruling, but they were not allowed to discuss them publicly. ""I found them extremely disturbing, sickening even,"" said Sandra Babcock, a human rights lawyer at Northwestern Law School. Al-Qahtani's treatment ""has been the subject of public debate and congressional inquiries, as well as internal agency investigations,"" according to the lawsuit. ""The American public should now be permitted to see what occurred for itself."" Babcock described al-Qahtani as a ""broken man"" who may never recover from the psychological and physical effects of the interrogation techniques allegedly used on him. In a 2009 interview with The Washington Post, the Pentagon official in charge of deciding whether Guantanamo detainees would go to trial said she concluded the al-Qahtani case could not proceed because of all the interrogation techniques used on him. ""His treatment met the legal definition of torture,"" Susan Crawford, then head of the convening authority of military commissions, told The Washington Post. ""The techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent."" Crawford has since left that Pentagon post. Al-Qahtani, a citizen of Saudi Arabia, tried to enter the United States at Orlando, Florida, on August 4, 2001, a little more than a month before the September 11 attacks. He was denied entry by immigration officials and was captured in Pakistan in December of 2001.","The Center for Constitutional Rights has filed the lawsuit .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Bank of England bought £2 billion ($2.8 billion) of government bonds Wednesday as the UK introduced quantitative easing to kickstart the ailing economy. UK interest rates are at their lowest levels since the Bank of England was founded in 1694. The move comes after the bank cut interest rates from one percent to 0.5 percent last week -- a drop of five percent since October last year and the lowest in the bank's 315-year history.  Central banks worldwide including the Bank of England have tried to encourage spending and lending during the current downturn by cutting interest rates -- with limited success. Rates can now not fall much further -- hence, the Bank of England believes, the need for another strategy. Quantitative easing is often described as ""printing money"" -- although no new notes and coins are actually created. Instead the Bank of England will ""create"" more money on its balance sheet, then use this to buy banks' assets such as home loans and government bonds, thereby pumping extra cash into the system. The banks all have accounts with the Bank of England, and the money will simply be credited to those accounts. The creation of more funds will be done electronically. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, which determines strategy, has the authority to create up to £150 billion ($207 billion) on the balance sheet, although it has said it will only inject £75 billion ($105 billion) over the next three months -- or £5 billion ($6.9 billion) per week. The first chunk is being used to buy government gilts, the UK's Press Association reported, at twice-weekly auctions. Quantitative easing was last introduced in a major economy in Japan from 2001 until 2006. The economy recovered, although expert opinion is divided as to whether quantitative easing helped with anything other than improving sentiment among consumers and business.","Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee can create $207B on balance sheets .

"(CNN) -- Is the ""Age of America"" drawing to a close? According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), its demise as the leading economic power is five years away and the next president of the United States will preside over an economy that plays second fiddle to China's. The lender posted data on its World Economic Outlook that puts 2016 as Year Zero for China as the world's dominant economic power -- the year when China's growth trajectory intersects the decline of the U.S.'s share of world gross domestic product in terms of purchasing price parity. According to the figures, the Chinese economy would grow from $11.2 trillion in 2011 to $19 trillion in 2016. Over the same period, the U.S. economy will rise from a dominant $15.2 trillion to a trailing $18.8 trillion. But, as the saying goes, statistics are often used like a drunken man uses a lamp-post -- for support rather than illumination. An analyst at the IMF said in a statement much hinges on whether economic size is measured by purchasing power parity -- what your money can actually buy on the ground in any given economy, the basis of the famous ""Big Mac"" index -- or GDP at market rates -- which is measured by converting the national currency into a common currency (normally the U.S. dollar) and measuring how much is flowing through the economy. The IMF projects U.S. GDP in dollars will be $15.2 trillion this year while China's will be $6.5 trillion, rising to $18.8 trillion and $11.2 trillion respectively by 2016. Under this measure, the US looks likely to stay the world's No. 1 economy if current growth rates are maintained. ""The IMF considers that GDP in purchase-power-parity (PPP) terms is not the most appropriate measure for comparing the relative size of countries to the global economy, because PPP price levels are influenced by non-traded services, which are more relevant domestically than globally,"" the IMF said. ""The Fund believes that GDP at market rates is a more relevant comparison. Under this metric, the U.S. is currently 130% bigger than China, and will still be 70% larger by 2016."" Nevertheless, the PPP index still has its fans, with some contending that China could be even stronger than it appears on paper thanks to the current artificially suppressed level of its currency. ""China actively suppresses the renminbi on the currency markets through massive dollar purchases. As a result the renminbi is deeply undervalued on the foreign-exchange markets. Just comparing the economies on their exchange rates misses that altogether,"" said MarketWatch columnist Brett Arends. ""Purchasing power parity is not a perfect measure. None exists. But it measures the output of economies in terms of real goods and services, not just paper money. That's why it's widely used to compare economies. The IMF publishes PPP data. So does the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Many economists rely on them,"" he said. While the slope of the graph is declining for the U.S. and rising for China, reports of the death of the U.S. economy look certain to be greatly exaggerated and could still be many decades away. Other measures such as per capita income as a proportion of GDP still sees the United States many years ahead of China and other readings that measure social and structural problems could still see the Chinese juggernaut blow a tire yet.","The IMF says China will overtake the U.S. as the world's leading economic power in 2016 .
Analysts dispute the figures saying that China still has a long way to go before it catches up .
China must overcome many structural and social problems before it is the global economic power ."
"(CNN) -- They may be winless in competitive fixtures so far this season, but Manchester United scored a victory of sorts on European football's transfer deadline day. United secured the services of the highly rated Colombian striker Radamel Falcao on a year-long loan from Monaco -- reported to be worth £6 million ($9.9 million), according to British media -- as part of a frantic finish. The window closed at midnight (CET) Monday, but United was granted an extension to complete the deal. Two of its English Premier League rivals, Arsenal and Manchester City, had reportedly been prepared to pay £55 million ($92 million) to sign Falcao, but Louis van Gaal's side won the race for the former Atletico Madrid forward's signature. Permanent deal . The pact includes an option to buy the player outright at the end of the loan spell. ""I am delighted to be joining Manchester United on loan this season. Manchester United is the biggest club in the world and is clearly determined to get back to the top,"" Falcao told the club's Website. ""I am looking forward to working with Louis van Gaal and contributing to the team's success at this very exciting period in the club's history."" Falcao has a superb goals-to-games ratio. In two seasons at Portuguese side Porto he scored 41 times in 51 appearances before joining Atletico in 2011, where he netted 52 times in 68 matches. Last season at Monaco was proving equally fertile with 11 goals in 20 matches before a knee injury sustained in January ruled the 28-year-old out of action for the rest of the season and the World Cup in Brazil. Falcao has since returned, playing in Monaco's pre-season friendlies last month, and will strengthen United's attacking options, which already include England international Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. The latter helped guide the Netherlands to the semifinals in Brazil this summer. Falcao follows Angel Di Maria through the doors at Old Trafford -- the Argentine winger signed from Real Madrid for a British record fee of £59.7 million ($98.7 million) last month. Dutch defender Daley Blind joined the 20-time English champions from Ajax, but some familiar names, especially strikers, headed for the exit. Players leaving . Javier Hernandez has joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan while fellow striker Danny Welbeck moved to Arsenal for an undisclosed fee on a long-term deal -- though the London club said the transfer is subject to the completion of regulatory formalities . Shinji Kagawa is returning to the Bundesliga where he will rejoin his former club Borussia Dortmund. The Japanese midfielder joined United in 2012 and rarely featured, scoring six goals in 57 appearances. Hernandez arrived at Old Trafford in 2010, scoring 59 goals in 159 appearances and winning two English Premier League titles, but has fallen out of favor in the past two seasons. A statement posted on the official Real Madrid website said that the club also have the option to buy the 26-year-old at the end of the loan spell. Elsewhere, current EPL leaders Chelsea have offloaded Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel to AC Milan on a season-long loan. Van Ginkel joined the West Londoners from Vitesse Arnhem last summer for £8 million ($13.3 million), but his first team opportunities have been limited to just four appearances. The 21-year-old follows Fernando Torres from Stamford Bridge to the San Siro -- the Spanish striker agreed a two-year loan deal at the weekend.","The European football league transfer window shut at midnight (CET) Monday .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- At least 24 paramilitary troops and a civilian were killed in an armed assault on their camp by suspected Maoists in eastern India, a district official said Tuesday. The attackers struck India's Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in West Bengal state's West Midnapore district on Monday. Top district official Narayan Swaroop Nigam told CNN that the raiders arrived on different types of vehicles and that they were equipped with sophisticated self-loading weapons. He insisted that Indian troops retaliated with fire. Two attackers apparently died, but their bodies had not yet been recovered, Nigam said. ""Security forces have combed the area and a manhunt has been launched,"" he added. India regards the communist rebels as its gravest internal security threat. The Maoists, on the other hand, have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. Just about a week ago, India's Home Minister P. Chidambaram acknowledged that more than 900 people, including almost 600 civilians, were killed in Maoist-related incidents in 2009. Besides, some 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said. ""However, I am confident that the state governments concerned will gradually gain the upper hand and re-establish the authority of the civil administration,"" Chidambaram told an internal security conference on February 7. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, conceded last year that the nation's fight with the Maoists had fallen short of objectives. Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest and tribal communities but also among youth and the intelligentsia, officials suspect. ""We have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace,"" Singh said in September 2009. ""It is a matter of concern that, despite our efforts, the level of violence in the affected states continues to rise."" In 2008, 1,591 Maoist rebel attacks killed 721 people, government officials say. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call ""class enemies,"" the rebels are also believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.","NEW: At least 24 paramilitary troops and a civilian were killed in armed attack .

"(CNN) -- Since the July 3 military coup, Egypt has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. El-Sisi's recent presidential bid reveals a tenacious attempt of the Egyptian military to consolidate power and preclude Egyptians' aspirations of having a genuine democracy. For the past few months, the Egyptian media and state institutions have been ardently working to pave the way for el-Sisi's presidency by distorting and smearing his political opponents. Over the past six decades, the Egyptian military has implanted its officers and generals in almost every aspect of civilian life from pasta and soap factories to the construction of soccer stadiums, bridges and infrastructure. Through such practices the army has successfully extended its control over the country. Consequently, the ""militarization"" of the Egyptian state, which was entrenched under Mubarak -- who systematically co-opted and spoiled military high-rank officers -- has weakened public institutions and created a feeble and fragmented political class that is now supporting the military's takeover. Gulf allies . With regional support mainly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who fervently seek to abort the Arab Spring, el-Sisi believes that he can suppress and tame the mounting anger and frustration among young Egyptians particularly Islamists who protest almost daily. By pouring billions of dollars into Egypt's economy, the Saudis and Emiratis believe that they can appropriate the Egyptian army and use it as a Trojan horse in order to eliminate and crush Islamists. Indeed, el-Sisi's Gulf counterparts view him as a ""savior"" not only from Islamists but more importantly from the very existential threat to their thrones: democracy. Thus it is not surprising that both, el-Sisi and his Gulf allies, share the same authoritarian mindset and behavior. They desperately seek to restore Mubarak's ruling-style with a new face. Surprisingly, or maybe not, the international community remains in limbo watching the manufacturing of a new dictatorship in Egypt while doing nothing to prevent the possibility of such a scenario. 'Stability vs. democracy' Moreover, despite the many instances of violations of human rights and the killing of civilians in the absence of any justice or accountability, the world powers have done nothing to stop such repulsive actions. The U.S. and the EU have failed miserably in pressuring the military to separate itself from politics and return to the barracks. Even as the Obama administration receives harsh criticism for its policies towards the Egyptian junta, Secretary of State John Kerry seems keen not to anger Egyptian officials. Not only has he praised the ""roadmap"" imposed by the military last July but he has also stated that ""Egyptians [are] following the right path."" Apparently, U.S. foreign policy towards Egypt's crisis continues to be driven by the long-standing delusional and misguided argument: stability vs. democracy. The U.S. policymakers believe that Egypt's military is the only force capable of retaining stability and maintaining security. However, one must only look to the experience of the past eight months to see that this argument is nothing but a myth. Simply, the level of violence and amount of killings and casualties is unprecedented in Egypt's modern history. For example, the Sinai Peninsula, which represents around 6% of Egypt's land, is almost out of the central government's control. And despite the ruthless security campaign there, militant Islamists still pose a serious threat to Egypt's national security. Furthermore, the interior ministry has failed to secure its own facilities and vehicles. It is also struggling to protect its own personnel who are targeted by militant Islamists. Social explosion . El-Sisi, Egypt's most likely post-coup president, will not be able to bring stability or security to the country. In fact, he has become a liability and an integral part of the problem not the solution. Although he has garnered significant public support since the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy, there are no guarantees that el-Sisi-mania will continue once he is president. The past three years have shown the volatility of the Egyptian public mood which can shift dramatically overnight particularly if el-Sisi doesn't quickly and appropriately fix Egypt's ailing economic and societal problems. Egypt is dangerously close to a social explosion due to unemployment, poverty and corruption. Moreover, Egypt is witnessing the largest waves of workers and professionals' strikes since January 2011. With the absence of any coherent economic policy, el-Sisi's presidency wouldn't be able to soothe the fears of many needy Egyptians who view him as a new Gamal Abdel Nasser. Surely, el-Sisi's Gulf backers will likely continue their ""lifeline"" of support, at least for a while. This money could buy el-Sisi some time but it will not certainly bring stability. History has shown that suppressing Islamists only leads to more extremism and instability. During 1970s and 1980s the cases of Algeria, Syria, Pakistan and Egypt all served to provide appalling examples of Islamist insurgency that would drain el-Sisi and his regional backers. An el-Sisi presidency would be a major cause for instability and insecurity in the region and would likely create more extremists and radicals. Therefore, it is important that the international community, particularly the U.S. and EU, do not lend credibility to the bogus elections that will bring him to power.

"(CNN) -- Look out Russia -- Team USA is coming. The World Cup may be four years away but coach Jurgen Klinsmann is already planning his team's path to the semifinals. A painful defeat in the last-16 by Belgium in Brazil might have ended the U.S. dream but it has only served to further Klinsmann's ambitions. A 1-0 friendly win over the Czech Republic in Prague courtesy of Alejandro Bedoya's strike gave Team USA a winning return to action but Klinsmann is already looking into the future. ""It was possible to get into the quarterfinal, Klinsmann told NBC. ""It was even possible to get into the semifinal in Brazil for us which nobody would probably believed. But this is how I looked at it. ""And this is our goal going toward Russia -- not to stop at the Round of 16 and not to stop at the quarterfinals. ""To say clearly we have four years to prepare this cycle and our goal is to go into a semifinal in a World Cup and that means a lot of work, a lot of competition and a lot of grind."" The achievements of Klinsmann's men at the World Cup has increased expectation and justifiably so. This U.S. team is a side which commands respect given its quality and improvement over the past couple of years. Deprived of goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has taken a year-long sabbatical from the national side to spend more time with his family, Aston Villa's Brad Guzan was given the opportunity to shine. It's a difficult job for Guzan given the hero status Howard acquired following the team's performances in Brazil. So impressive was Howard that he became a national celebrity with President Obama calling him directly from the White House to offer his congratulations following the 2-1 defeat by Belgium. Howard, boasting one of the most exquisite beards in football, pulled off a record 16 saves against the Belgians leading to Obama even joking he should make the goalkeeper the nation's Secretary of Defense. But with Howard absent along with Clint Dempsey, the man known as 'Captain America' during the tournament, Klinsmann gave a chance to a number of other players. In a first half which meandered without much drama, it was the home side which should have taken the lead just after the half hour mark. A rapid counter attack ripped through the U.S. midfield and Tomas Rosicky crossed to the far post only for Vladimir Darida to slide his effort wide of the far post. That miss was to prove costly as just before the interval, the visiting team stuck the first blow. A dreadful error by Darida allowed Mix Diskerud to run through on goal and when his effort was saved, Bedoya netted the rebound. Klinsmann made a couple of changes at the break with Nick Rimando, the only MLS-based player in the squad, replacing Guzan in goal and Bolton's Tim Ream coming into defense. But it hardly appeared to disrupt the rhythm of the team with Bedoya bringing a fine save out of Petr Cech in the Czech Republic goal. The Czechs, which failed to qualify for the World Cup, have set their sights on qualifying for the 2016 European Championship Finals in France. It faces a difficult task after being paired with the Netherlands and Turkey as well as Latvia, Iceland and Kazakhstan. It did at least threaten an equalizer in the second half with Rimando producing a fine save to deny Ladislav Krejčí from close-range. The Salt Lake City stopper than kept out David Limbersky's effort as the home side began to take control of the contest. With Team USA now boasting a more youthful look following the introductions of 18-year-old Emerson Hyndman and Club Tijuana teenager Greg Garza, the Czechs stepped up its game. Daniel Pudil was next to go close after latching onto a poor defensive header but Rimando stood firm to keep his side in front and secure the victory. Team USA faces games against Honduras and Ecuador next month before taking on the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in November. World champion . Germany returned to play its first fixture on home soil since winning the World Cup -- but it didn't exactly go to plan as it lost for the first time in 15 months. Joachim Low's team was beaten 4-2 by Argentina just 52 days after the teams met in the final at the Maracana Stadium. On that occasion, Mario Gotze scored the only goal of the game in extra-time after the contest had finished goalless after 90 minutes. This time around, Argentina, without its talisman Lionel Messi, was led by Manchester United winger Angel di Maria. The former Real Madrid player, who arrived at Old Trafford last week in a deal worth $98.7 million, set up three goals and scored one himself. Sergio Aguero and Erik Lamela both converted chances provided by di Maria before halftime to give the visitors a two-goal lead. And Argentina continued its assault after the interval, adding two more inside the opening five minutes with Federico Fernandez heading home a di Maria free kick before the United star added a fourth. Germany, without a number of players who helped the team win the World Cup following a number of retirements, hit back with Andre Schurrle and Gotze scoring consolation goals. New era? England's new era got off to a winning start following a 1-0 victory over Norway in London. In front of one of the lowest crowds to attend an England international game at Wembley stadium since it was reopened in 2007, Wayne Rooney's second half penalty was enough to see off the visitors. Elsewhere, Russia recorded a 4-0 win over Azerbaijan, Ukraine defeated Latvia 1-0 and Turkey picked a 2-1 win in Denmark.","Team USA defeats Czech Republic 1-0 in Prague .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some may not realize that the modern Republican Party owes its origin to the fight over slavery nearly two centuries ago. In the tumultuous mid-1800s, right before the Civil War, some political activists were concerned about keeping slavery from spreading into new western territories, and they saw no way to stop it through existing political powers: the Democrats and the Whigs (the pro-Congress party of the mid 1800s that largely destroyed itself in the 1852 elections in a battle over slavery). So they formed a new party, taking the name ""Republicans"" in a salute to earlier American politicians. By 1861, they had their first president: Abraham Lincoln. Soon after, slavery fell. The Whig party disappeared. And the Republicans began a long steady rise in power. Even back then, the party liked to talk about fiscal responsibility -- immigration, religion -- and the need for a strong business climate. All of this spurred a sympathetic Chicago newspaper to call the Republicans the Grand Old Party, or the GOP. Republican voters were strongest in rural and western parts of the country, and they were highly successful at maximizing electoral votes to produce presidents: Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt were among their early successes. However, World War I brought sharp policy disagreements to the party. And when Herbert Hoover ushered in the Great Depression, the Republicans were driven into retreat. It would be 20 years until they won the White House again, under Dwight Eisenhower. But since 1969, they have been largely back to their winning ways. During that time, Republicans have been in the Oval Office for almost twice as many years as the Democrats -- Nixon (elected to two terms, but resigned at the start of his second), Ford (served out Nixon's second term), Reagan (elected to two terms), George H.W. Bush (elected to one term) and George W. Bush (elected to two terms). Now Mitt Romney is hoping to restart that tradition.","Republicans emerge as an anti-slavery party in 1800s .

"(Health.com) -- You know a little something about how to order healthy at Asian restaurants. Brown rice trumps white, summer rolls are lower cal than egg rolls, and you should run from General Tso's anything. But with the explosion of Asian fusion, figuring out what to order can be as murky as a bowl of freshly stirred miso soup. ""There are hidden fats and preparation details that can really keep you guessing,"" says Angela Ginn, R.D., a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. And those unknowns can double, even triple, the calorie count and fat content of a dish. Here's how to dig in without blowing your diet. 1. Edamame isn't automatically low cal . Before you make an appetizer out of those delicious fiber-packed soybeans, ask how the pods have been prepared. If the answer is that they were simply steamed in water, they're an excellent pick, but ""some places toss them in oil after steaming them,"" Ginn reveals. ""So what starts out at 120 calories per half cup becomes 220."" That may not seem like a lot, but if you're on a diet, a bowlful could do you in. Solution: Request they serve 'em with no added oil. Health.com: Everything you need to know about soy . 2. Lobster sauce doesn't deserve its bad rap . It tastes so rich it has to be naughty, right? Actually, at just about 50 calories per quarter-cup, it's one of the lower-cal sauces. ""It's not laden with sugar like sweet and sour sauce, either,"" notes Katie Chin, a chef and author of 300 Best Rice Cooker Recipes. 3. Those light-as-air shrimp chips aren't so light . They seem way healthier than old-school crunchy noodles. But don't be fooled: They're a mix of deep-fried shrimp and starch, and they'll set you back more than 200 calories and 14 grams of fat per handful, says Jessica Ganzer, R.D.. She suggests sipping a cup of green tea while you wait for your entrÃ©e. Otherwise, you could munch away a meal's worth of calories and fat before it shows up. Health.com: Dine out like a health pro . 4. Veggies aren't always virtuous . What could be healthier than ordering a side of green beans? Plenty, if they're from a Chinese menu. Before stir-frying veggie side dishes, ""Chinese restaurants traditionally deep-fry them for extra texture,"" says Brian Ray, co-executive chef at Buddakan in New York City. What's more, some veggies absorb oil the way sponges drink in water, explains Ganzer. ""Eggplant soaks up oil and sauce like no other vegetable,"" she says. Opt for less sponge-like veggies such as broccoli, snow peas, or peppers. Plus, ask them to stir-fry only and go light on the oil. 5. The same goes for steamed dumplings . Sure, steaming saves calories, but whether it's enough to matter depends on what's inside. A steamed pork dumpling is around 80 calories -- just ten fewer than the pan-fried version. Those stuffed with vegetables, on the other hand, are about 35 calories a piece. So if you love the pork version and can stop at one dumpling, go for it. But if you're, well, only human and tend to enjoy a few at a sitting, try the steamed veggie dumplings -- three will save you more than 130 calories and nearly 10 grams of fat over their steamed pork brethren. Bonus: ""Veggies naturally have a lot less sodium than shrimp or pork,"" notes Elisa Zied, R.D., author of ""Nutrition at Your Fingertips"". Health.com: Irresistible, healthy Asian recipes . 6. Stir-fry won't derail your diet . Sure, it'll cost you more in the calorie department -- a main-dish veggie stir-fry is about 370 calories per serving versus around 140 for its steamed counterpart -- but the pay-off in flavor may be worth it. ""Steamed vegetables are the best option, but stir-fried is OK too, as long as a minimal amount of oil is used,"" says Ming Tsai, chef and owner of Blue Ginger in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and host of ""Simply Ming"" on PBS. Plus, you'll get the added health benefits of ginger, an anti-inflammatory, and garlic, which is loaded with antioxidants. As for that ""minimal amount,"" just ask them to use as little oil as possible. 7. The lightest lo mein isn't always veggie . It's often shrimp! A serving at P.F. Chang's clocks in with about 30% less sodium and nearly 200 fewer calories than the veggie version. Wondering how vegetables could be the less healthy choice? See number 4, above: Asian restaurants tend to drown them in sodium-loaded soy sauce and oil to enhance flavor, Zied says. Health.com: America's healthiest fast food restaurants . 8. Tofu takeout can be a diet wrecker . Not all soy is skinny-making. ""Some tofu dishes are high in calories because the tofu has been deep-fried before it hits the stir-fry pan,"" Ginn reveals. Be sure to ask how it's prepared, and steer clear if it's fried or described as ""crispy"" -- or ask them to use soft or plain tofu instead. 9. You can have your (sushi) crunch and eat it too . Who needs tempura? There are waistline-friendlier ways to get the texture you're craving. ""Request a sprinkling of chopped peanuts, almonds, or cashews on the inside or outside of your roll,"" suggests Meredith Boyle, the corporate culinary manager at SushiSamba restaurant group. ""Or ask for some crispy salmon skin in the roll,"" she adds. ""You'll get omega-3s and really great flavor along with the crunch."" 10. One entrÃ©e serves two people . Chinese and Thai dishes typically contain enough food for two or three people. ""It's meant to be family style,"" says Corinne Trang, a food and beverage consultant and author of ""Noodles Every Day"". So if you're dining out, split with your guy or a friend. Eating in? Portion out half before you dig in -- then save the rest for tomorrow's (yummy!) lunch.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- What's in a name? For my friends and simpaticos in the immigration reform community, enough to go ballistic at the mere mention of the phrase: ""illegal immigrant."" First, there's enough to be afraid of in this world -- from big government to monsters under the bed. We shouldn't be afraid of words. And when it comes time to declare a word or phrase offensive, we should be careful to do so judiciously and not go overboard. That's my advice to my very good friend and business partner, Charles Garcia, for whom I have great affection and tremendous respect. He's my brother from another mother. That's true even on the rare occasion when he's wrong. And that's the case this week now that Charlie has written, in a thought-provoking column for CNN.com, that the phrase ""illegal immigrant"" is ""biased"" and ""racially offensive."" He also implied that it's a ""slur"" and -- borrowing language from George Orwell -- a ""worn-out and useless phrase."" Actually, it's none of the above. The phrase is accurate. It's the shoe that fits. It's reality. And, as is often the case with reality, it's hard for some people to accept. What do you think about the term? Share your view with CNN iReport. Apparently, that includes people like Justice Sonia Sotomayor who, in her first opinion on the Supreme Court -- in a 2009 case called Mohawk Industries v. Carpenter, which involved a business accused of employing illegal immigrants -- used the term ""undocumented immigrant."" According to The New York Times, this was the first time that a Supreme Court justice had used that phrase. Other justices had previously gone with ""illegal immigrant."" Undocumented immigrant? Really? That's politically correct, but it's also absurd. Most of these people have plenty of documents. A woman who makes a living cleaning homes in my neighborhood once explained to me that she had a drawer full of fake green cards and IDs saying she was -- pick one -- a native-born U.S. citizen, legal resident or exchange student. Many illegal immigrants have Matricula ID cards issued by Mexican consulates, foreign passports, drivers licenses in some states and phony Social Security cards where all nine digits are ""0's."" Garcia: Why ""illegal immigrant"" is a slur . This isn't about documents. It has been my experience that many of those who have trouble with the phrase ""illegal immigrant"" are really troubled by something deeper -- the fact that, at the end of the day, by supporting a pathway to earned legal status, they're defending a group of people who engaged in unlawful activity. For some folks, this is messy business. So they try to sanitize it by changing the language. As a columnist, I don't mind messy. I have never used ""illegal aliens,"" and I never will. And I don't use ""illegal"" as a noun. But, like many other journalists, including those at CNN, I do use ""illegal immigrant."" And I refuse to accept that doing so is tantamount to a hate crime. I don't want to demean anyone. But, as someone who makes his living with words, I'd also prefer not to degrade the English language. Besides, in more than 20 years of writing about illegal immigrants -- oops, there, I said it again -- I've been accused of defending lawbreakers thousands of times. I plead guilty as charged. I don't condone illegal immigration, but I do often defend illegal immigrants who are unfairly exploited, picked on and blamed for everything from crime to pollution to the quality of public schools. As Charlie correctly points out in the part of the column with which I agree, a lot of that nonsense comes from the Republican Party and shameful politicians who think that raising our blood pressure over illegal immigration is a shortcut to helping them raise their poll numbers and raise funds from contributors. I've spanked many of these officials before, and I look forward to the next opportunity. For the record, I'm not against high blood pressure. I've been known to raise it myself. I think that, if people are upset that our immigration system is broken, they have a right to be angry. But I also think they should direct their anger at government and politicians, and not at the immigrants themselves. I also think that illegal immigrants are more of a positive than a negative. They make a contribution to the U.S. economy, do jobs Americans won't do, replenish the American spirit with hope and optimism and often raise good kids with a work ethic and strong traditional values that put the native-born to shame. They're not a liability. They're an asset. Naturalized citizens explain why they're American by choice . But, c'mon. These people are not saints. With the exception of DREAM Act kids involuntarily brought here by their parents, these people did something wrong. Illegal immigrants either overstayed a visa or crossed a border without authorization. That was wrong. Then many of them doubled down on the misdeed by using fake documents to procure employment or not paying income taxes on money earned, even though the federal government has set up an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number that allows illegal immigrants to pay taxes. If that sounds harsh, blame my upbringing. I'm the grandson of a Mexican immigrant who came to the United States legally during the Mexican Revolution and my father spent 36 years as a cop. It's in my DNA to not make excuses for wrongdoing. My friends in the immigration reform community need to get over their uneasiness and stop sugar coating who these people are and what they've done to get here. We can't fix the problem of illegal immigration until we deal with it honesty and candidly. As Charlie mentioned, Justice Anthony Kennedy has an interesting take on illegal immigration, which he incorporated into the majority opinion in the recent Supreme Court decision striking down most of the Arizona immigration law. Kennedy wrote: ""As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States."" True. But ""present"" doesn't just happen. The estimated 10 million illegal immigrants who are unlawfully in the United States didn't just appear one day like the genie out of Aladdin's lamp. Like the old saying goes: ""If you see a turtle resting on a fence post, you can be sure someone put it there. It didn't get there by itself."" At some point in time, again with the exception of DREAM'ers, someone did something bad. That doesn't make them bad people. But they broke the law. We're not talking about criminal law, and so they're not ""criminals."" Immigration law is based in civil law, and that's why those who break it get deported and not imprisoned. But these people are still lawbreakers, and -- by definition -- illegal immigrants. Sorry, Charlie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Those who say ""illegal immigrant"" is a slur are wrong .
He says adult migrants who aren't legal immigrants broke the law to get to the U.S.
Navarrette: Migrants aren't criminals and are wrongly blamed for many of America's ills .
Still, he says, it doesn't help to gloss over fact that immigration laws were broken ."
"(CNN) -- For most of its roughly two-year existence, Instagram has trapped its bounty inside mobile apps. More recently, though, the photo-sharing service has made chunks of its service available to desktop users. First you could view a page for individual photos from any browser, and in November it added profile pages that displayed all of a user's images. As of Tuesday, you finally see a working version of your Instagram feed online. Login at Instagram.com and you'll get a replica of your Instagram home screen with photos from everyone you follow unfurling as you scroll down the browser window. There are no extra bells or whistles here, but you can double click to ""Like"" an image, leave comments and follow or unfollow people. Unfortunately, the web version is still missing the most important Instagram feature: the ability to upload photos. The company has always put mobile first. The photos shared on the app are meant to be taken with the built-in cameras on mobile devices and their low resolution a perfect match for Instagram's grainy film filters. As the Facebook-owned service becomes more popular, there will be demand to access it from more devices, even to share photographs taken with higher-quality cameras. But for now the company is putting mobility and speed ahead of those features. ""Our focus on building out a mobile-only experience is a unique path that we've chosen for many reasons, the most important of which is that Instagram, at its core, is about seeing and taking photos on-the-go,"" said co-founder Kevin Systrom in a blog post announcing the feature. The web interface is missing other parts familiar to app users, as well. The explore page that allows you to browse by users or hashtags is not there, and neither is the fun photo-map feature that lets you see where in the world a user took all their photos. Third-party instagram client Webstagram has an online version of your Instagram feed. Though not nearly as attractive as the new official version, it still has some of those features missing from Instagram's website, including the ability to click on hashtags and see your followers and those people you are following.","Photo-sharing service Instagram now lets you see your feed on any computer .

"(CNN) -- A judge, who was suspended after an online video showing him beating his teenage daughter went viral, was reinstated by the Texas Supreme Court this week. Judge William Adams was back working Wednesday at Aransas County after his suspension was lifted by the state's high court, a court clerk said. The state's Commission on Judicial Conduct earlier ruled that Adams would receive a public warning for the incident, which cleared the way for the suspension to be lifted. The move to allow the judge back on the bench angered Adams' former wife and daughter. ""My first feeling is extreme sadness,"" said Hallie Adams, the former wife. ""I feel sad for the public. I see the justice system is failing and justice review system is failing."" Hillary Adams, the judge's daughter, was also upset. ""I'm embarrassed to live in Texas,"" said the girl who was the buzz on the Internet last year after releasing the beating video. Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public. It showed him beating his then-16-year-old daughter because she downloaded online music and games. The beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet ""to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time,"" Hillary Adams, wrote on the Internet posting. She said she released the video after being harassed by her father. ""It was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" she said last November. ""It wasn't any huge happening or anything."" She said she told her father she had the video, ""and he didn't seem to think anything of it, and basically dared me to post it."" The video posting said, ""Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again. His 'judgment' is a giant farce. Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter."" The 7 1/2-minute video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries. At one point, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, ""What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal."" At another point, he yells at her, ""You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?"" William Adams has acknowledged that the man in the video was him. As a judge, William Adams handles misdemeanor cases, including family-related and juvenile court issues.","The judge is back to work, a clerk says .

"(CNN) -- On a man-made island in the Middle East, the world's newest super mall sits empty -- for now. Inside, water fountains shoot into the air, giant plasma screens flash advertisements, escalators rise and fall; their only admirers are the odd construction worker. Missing from this scene are the shoppers. But come November, Abu Dhabi's 235,000 square meter Yas Mall plans to open its doors to 20 million visitors per year. ""It's a conservative estimate,"" says Mohammed Khalifa Al Mubarak, CEO of Aldar Properties, the developers behind the ambitious design. Think big . With over 400 stores, Yas Mall will be the second largest shopping complex in the United Arab Emirates, developers hoping it will emulate the success of neighboring Dubai Mall -- double the size at 502,000 square meters. ""Over the last five years, the growth of both Dubai Mall and the Mall of the Emirates has been immense,"" explained Al Mubarak. ""They've both become destinations in themselves. ""Abu Dhabi does not have that sort of destination here, it does not have that visitor experience. It needs that, it's hungry for it, and Yas Mall is hopefully going to cater to that hunger."" Island living . The plush shopping center is the latest addition to Yas Island, a purpose-built $40 billion holiday destination rising off the coast of Abu Dhabi. Opened in 2009, the island boasts a Formula One circuit, water park, and ""Ferrari World"" with the fastest roller coaster on the planet. If shoppers are as ""hungry,"" as Al Mubarak says, then Abu Dhabi is working hard to feed them. Last year the city was ranked 18th in the world in terms of new retail space. And before consumers have even stepped inside Yas Mall, Al Mubarak is already talking expansion. ""We couldn't fit all the retailers we wanted to be here, so we're already starting to plan phase two,"" he said. ""Abu Dhabi is a growing city. It's growing in its developments, it's growing in its demographics. And we are catering our retail for each aspect."" Smooth sailing? This phenomenal growth hasn't been without losses. Aldar was 13.7billion dirhams (U.S. $3.7 billion) in debt last year, later merging with rival Sorouh Real Estate. ""We continue to manage our debt to the best of our abilities, and we continue to be a development company,"" said Al Mubarak. ""Over the last year we've launched two major projects that had been completely sold out. But we have developed in a mature, professional manner."" As the finishing touches are made at Yas Mall, we'll soon find out if the island's latest addition sinks or swims. Property: Middle East hot spots not where you think .

"(CNN) -- ""MasterChef"" runner-up Joshua Marks was found dead of a gunshot to his head in an alley on Chicago's south side Friday night, police said Saturday. Investigators have not yet ruled whether Marks, who has publicly acknowledged suffering from bipolar disorder, committed suicide, Chicago Police spokesman John Mirabelli told CNN. Marks, 26, lost to winner Christine Ha in the final round of the Fox reality cooking competition's third season. His death comes three months after he was arrested following a scuffle with several Chicago police officers, according to the Chicago Tribune. Marks told police he had been possessed by ""MasterChef"" judge Gordon Ramsay, who turned him into God, the newspaper reported. Ramsay posted a message on his Twitter account Saturday reacting to Marks' death: ""Just heard the devastating news about Josh Marks. My thoughts are with his family & friends at this tragic time."" Marks -- who at 7-foot-2 was known by friends as ""a gentle giant"" -- spoke about his mental illness in a public service video he recorded for the Make a Sound Project, a suicide awareness program. The project promotes ""how to use music as an alternative to the crazy thoughts you may have going in you mind,"" Marks said in the video. ""Me personally, I have bipolar disorder, so, you know, I'll get a little anxious sometimes, and how I cool out is, I listen to music and just listen to the words and just relax and, you know, find my melody. I wish we had some music going on in here right now."" But after Marks was arrested, project founder Mike Castaneda told a reporter he was removing Marks from the venture, but on Saturday, Castaneda described his comment as ""a poor statement."" A media outlet ""had contacted us and made the statement, 'Is it safe to say you're dropping Josh in light of recent events' to which I ignorantly replied immediately, 'yes.' It wasn't the thought that I would actually drop Josh, especially being as that he's a friend of mine. I know I should have used better wording just knowing that I couldn't use him for events until he was through his situation and healthy again,"" Castaneda said in an e-mail to CNN. ""He has been a good friend to me and though I've made a mistake I would hope that Josh would feel the same way,"" Castaneda added. ""I will miss Josh more than any one will know. I just pray through this more will come to seek help before it's too late."" Detectives are talking to witnesses and examining security camera video from near where Marks' body was found, Mirabelli said.

"AMSTETTEN, Austria (CNN) -- Three children freed from a cellar in which their mother had been imprisoned and raped by her own father for 24 years had never seen daylight, police in Austria have confirmed. A hidden, narrow bedroom found in the cellar of the house where Josef Fritzl held his daughter captive. Police spokesman Franz Polzer told CNN that 73-year-old Josef Fritzl admitted holding his daughter, Elisabeth Fritzl, 42, hostage in the windowless cell and fathering seven children by her. ""The mother had memories [of the outside world] and got used to the situation,"" Polzer told a press conference Monday afternoon. ""The others knew nothing else."" The main question reverberating from the small Austrian town: How could a man keep his daughter locked in his basement for 24 years, where she gave birth to seven of his children while her mother and three of those children lived upstairs without an inkling of the horrors in the cellar? Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance by saying she had run away from home, a story backed up by letters he forced Elisabeth to write, including one that begged her parents not to look for her. Other letters made it seem the missing daughter had left the three children on the parents' doorstep -- when in fact they had been born in captivity in the family's basement. Elisabeth told police that she and her three children Kerstin, 19; Stefan, 18; and Felix, 5, did not see the light of day during their entire time in captivity underneath the building in Amstetten, a rural town about 150 km (93 miles) west of Vienna. Elisabeth is described as ""very disturbed"" and having trouble talking to police about her ordeal, reports CNN correspondent Fred Pleitgen. She went missing in 1984, when she was 18 years old, police have said. More details also emerged at the news conference about the basement dungeon in which the daughter and her children were kept -- and how her father managed to keep them captive for more than two decades.  See inside the cellar prison » . The authorities have revealed that the prison, constructed in the basement of the 1960s building, ran underneath both the building itself and the garden outside. The entrance was via a small door, hidden behind cupboards in the basement, controlled by an electronic keyless-entry system. Polzer said that the prison was hard to find, even if someone was looking for it, and had been soundproofed. ""Even though they shouted and called they were not in a position to let anyone hear them,"" Polzer told the press conference. Polzer said that Fritzl made clear to his wife and other children that the area was out of bounds and they were not to go into the basement. He bought food and took it to his captives in the evening.  Watch a report on details of the case » . Detectives made the grim discovery about the cellar  earlier this month after Kerstin was hospitalized in Amstetten after falling unconscious and taken to a hospital in Amstetten by her grandfather with a SOS note from her mother hidden on her. A DNA test was later carried out which revealed her grandfather, Josef Fritzl, was also her father, according to ORF, Austria's state-run news agency. That sparked a police investigation, which revealed that Fritzl fathered at least six children with his daughter, forcing her and three of the surviving children to live in the cellar of his house, according to ORF's Peter Schmitzberger.  Watch police describe the captives' jail » . On Sunday, police searched the hidden rooms where Fritzl admitted he kept his daughter and their children, including sleeping quarters, a kitchen and a bathroom, which Fritzl told police he built, Polzer said. Amstetten police say they were put on Fritzl's trail following an anonymous tip off. They apprehended the pair on Saturday near the hospital and once police assured the daughter that she would never have contact with her father again, ""she was able to tell the whole story,"" Schmitzberger said. Elisabeth said her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984 -- weeks before she was reported missing -- her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room, she told police. For the next 24 years, she was constantly raped by her father, resulting in the six surviving children, she said, according to the police statement. She also told police she gave birth to twins in 1996, but one of the babies died a few days later as a result of neglect, and Fritzl removed the infant's body and burned it in an oven. She told police that only her father supplied her and her children with food and clothing, and that she did not think his wife knew anything about their situation . Fritzl lived upstairs with his wife, Rosemarie, who police said had no idea about her husband's other family living in the cellar. The couple adopted three of the children that Fritzl had with his daughter, according to police. He told his wife that his missing daughter had dropped the unwanted children off at the house because she could not take care of them, police said. When Kerstin fell ill, Fritzl apparently told his wife and the hospital that his ""missing"" daughter had dropped off the sick girl on his doorstep. In an effort to find out about Kerstin's condition, the hospital and police asked the media to put out a bulletin requesting any information about the girl or her missing mother, attorney general Gerhard Sedlacek told NTV. Sometime later, Fritzl brought Elisabeth out of the cellar, telling his wife that she had returned home with her two children after a 24-year absence, police said. He took Elisabeth to the hospital to talk with doctors about Kerstin's condition, and at that point, authorities became aware of her situation, Sedlacek said. E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- An energized electorate inspired by a groundbreaking election and expectations as high as Mount Everest had grown accustomed to greeting him with spontaneous chants of  ""yes we can."" He promised to take ""bold, swift action"" on the ailing economy and break the partisan grip on Washington by ending what he called ""petty grievances and false promises."" Obama proclaims an end to 'petty grievances' ""There are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans,"" the president told the nation during his inaugural address in 2009.  ""Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this country has already done."" This high bar assured there would be a very long to-do-list, and some Republicans were quick to publicly admit they would not make his job easy. But some political observers make the case that pushing a lot of promises was a necessity for an unproven freshman senator. ""He really needed to prove himself to a lot of individual Democratic constituencies,"" said Bill Adair, the creator and editor of PolitiFact, an online site best known for rating the truth in campaign advertisements.  ""He made dozens and dozens of small but very narrow promises."" PolitiFact evaluated 508 promises and concluded that the president has kept 37% of them, compromised on 14% of them, has broken 16% of them, has gotten stalled on 10% of them and 22% are still ""in the works."" It's all detailed in the online site's Obameter scorecard. One big stumble came soon after the president took office.  During an interview on the CBS program ""60 Minutes,"" Obama had said he intended to ""close Guantanamo"" and vowed to ""follow through on that."" But legal hurdles and resistance in Congress neutralized his executive order to close the detention facility within a year. Obama signs order to close Guantanamo Bay facility . Another promise that ran into a wall on Capitol Hill was the vow to repeal Bush-era tax cuts for the very rich. And with homeowners trying to recover from a crippling mortgage crisis, especially in states such as Nevada and Florida, a promised $10 billion dollar foreclosure prevention fund never materialized. ""He made some really sweeping promises about changing the culture of Washington, about bringing the parties together, about being more transparent in how he runs the White House,"" Adair said. ""He ran into trouble there. There's been a real realization on the part of the White House that some of the things he said during the 2008 campaign were just not realistic given the way Washington really works."" Immigration reform advocates urge Obama to take action . The very long list goes on: No comprehensive immigration reform. No cap and trade system that regulates pollution emissions. Some of these broken promises provide critics with plenty of fodder to argue he has been ineffective. But the White House views his bucket of promises as half-full. Health care reform. Check. Auto industry bailout. Check. ""Don't ask don't tell,"" the policy that banned openly gays and lesbians from serving in the military, repealed. Check. Repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' seen as 'tipping point' in gay rights movement . The Obameter Scorecard also gives the president a thumbs up on national security. In 2008 while visiting Jordan, the president vowed to end the war in Iraq. ""My goal is to no longer have U.S. troops engaged in combat in Iraq."" That promise was fulfilled in December. Added to that is that the conflict in Afghanistan is winding down and the world's most-wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden, is dead. ""The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda"" the president said as he broke the news in a hastily arranged late-night Sunday address to the nation in May 2011. Between now and Election Day, it's possible other promises stuck in the works could go either way, although campaigning has consumed much of the oxygen. Adair said there is plenty of blame to go around. Congress has created some impassable barriers but at the same time, he argues other promises were ""low-hanging fruit"" that the president could have accomplished through executive action but so far hasn't delivered.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Elian Gonzalez, the focus of a bitter international custody dispute after he was rescued at sea as a child, left Cuba on Friday for the first time since 2000, when the U.S. government returned him to the island. Gonzalez, who also turned 20 on Friday, traveled to Quito, Ecuador, as part of a 200-member Cuban delegation to a weeklong youth conference there. It marks a return to the international spotlight for Gonzalez, who recently said in an interview published in Cuba's state-run media that his fame continues to follow him in Cuba. ""Wherever I go there's always a child, an old woman that comes to me and wants to meet me,"" he said. ""Not because I am famous but because they suffered with my family."" Where is he now? In 1999, Gonzalez, then 6 years old, was found clinging to an inner tube on the open sea after the rickety boat he was traveling in from Cuba to the United States sank. Gonzalez's mother and nine other people who were taking part in the clandestine journey drowned. After his rescue, Gonzalez was placed with relatives in Miami, who wanted to keep him in the United States. But Gonzalez's father, Juan Miguel, fought to bring him back to Cuba. Then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro led massive protests on the island demanding Gonzalez's return. The case of the telegenic boy became a flashpoint between supporters and opponents of Castro's revolution. As the two sides fought out the high-profile case in court, U.S. immigration officials decided to put Gonzalez in the custody of his father, who had come to the United States to argue for Elian's return. His relatives in Miami refused to go along, and armed federal agents then raided the home of Gonzalez's uncle and seized the boy. Gonzalez was reunited with his father, and after a few more weeks of court proceedings -- ending with the Supreme Court rejecting the Miami relatives' efforts to get him back -- the father and son returned to Cuba. There the government celebrated a political victory but largely kept Elian Gonzalez out of public view and surrounded by government bodyguards.

"(CNN) -- AT&T has announced a plan that could see high-speed fiber Internet networks rolled out in as many as 100 cities in 21 metro regions throughout the United States. It's a move that puts the telecommunications company in a head-to-head battle with Google, which has begun its own charge to dramatically Increase internet speeds in various cities. The network, called AT&T U-verse With GigaPower, is able to deliver broadband at up to 1 gigabit per second. That's roughly 100 times faster than current speeds in many parts of the nation. The company plans to enter discussions with local leaders in areas it has identified as having suitable existing networks and likely high demand for the service. ""This initiative continues AT&T's ongoing commitment to economic development in these communities, bringing jobs, advanced technologies and infrastructure,"" the company said in a news release. The metropolitan areas being considered are: Atlanta; Augusta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago; Cleveland; Fort Worth, Texas; Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Greensboro, North Carolina; Houston; Jacksonville, Florida; Kansas City, Kansas; Los Angeles; Miami; Nashville; Oakland, California; Orlando, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego; St. Louis; San Francisco, and San Jose. AT&T had already announced plans to install the high-speed network in Austin and Dallas, Texas, and says it is in ""advanced discussions"" with Raleigh-Durham and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It's worth emphasizing that none of this is a guarantee yet. More likely, it's AT&T publicly pointing out locations it thinks are good candidates for network upgrades. Google, meanwhile, first launched Google Fiber in 2012. That service also promises speeds of 1 gigabit per second, which the company says could allow someone at full capacity to download an entire feature-length movie in 38 seconds. Google has already brought the service to Kansas City, Kansas; and Provo, Utah and plans to roll out in Austin, Texas, by the end of this year. Google connects fiberoptic cables directly to a home or office in order to give users broadband Internet and television service. In Kansas City and Provo, Google's ultra-fast Internet service costs $70 a month for Internet, or $120 if you add streaming video. In February, Google said it's exploring plans to lay down the special cables in nine more metro areas: Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, San Antonio and San Jose. That includes 34 cities in those regions.","AT&T looks to bring high-speed Internet to 21 major metro areas .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton grabbed his second straight pole position to begin the 2014 Formula One season. But he hopes the Malaysian Grand Prix goes better than the opener in Melbourne. Hamilton was forced to retire early into the Australian Grand Prix this month and could only watch as Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg emerged victorious. ""For myself and for the team the priority is to try to bag as many points, collectively, me and Nico,"" Hamilton told reporters Saturday. ""I think we have a great opportunity. ""We've got a great car and the team's just performing fantastically right now, so fingers crossed we both see our way through to the finish line."" Hamilton bettered reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull by 0.055 seconds in a rain-hit, eventful qualifying session at the Sepang International Circuit for the 33rd pole of his career. That ties him for the British record with Jim Clark. Rosberg was third. ""Today was just incredible, how much, firstly, it rained before qualifying and then during the session it was very, very tricky out there I think for everyone,"" said Hamilton. ""Particularly at the end it was almost impossible to see anything. ""During my last lap I just couldn't see a thing behind (Force India's Nico) Hulkenberg. I couldn't see where the track went, didn't know where the corners were, when to brake."" Even though he was only fractionally behind Hamilton in qualifying, Vettel suggested Mercedes was the team to beat Sunday. ""I think Mercedes as a team has the best package,"" he told reporters. ""They've done a very good job across the break. ""I think they're the favorites at the moment, no matter, I think, where we go. As a fact, after that I think it's fairly close between the other Mercedes-powered teams and probably Ferrari and us."" Former world champion Fernando Alonso finished fourth -- despite colliding with Daniil Kvyat of Toro Rosso -- followed by Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Caterham's Marcus Ericsson crashed in the first qualifying session, losing control of his car and hitting the wall. Williams' Valtteri Bottas received a grid penalty -- going from 15th to 18th -- after impeding a not impressed Ricciardo. ""We raced each other a lot in the junior categories and I thought we had a lot of respect for each other, but it's a little difficult how many times he's done that now,"" Ricciardo was quoted as saying by Autosport.com.","Lewis Hamilton finishes first in qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Grammy-winning music producer Phil Spector, 69, has been moved to a California prison to serve his sentence of 19 years to life for killing actress Lana Clarkson, corrections officials said. Phil Spector will serve time at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison. Spector, who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced last month in Clarkson's 2003 shooting death, will be housed at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran. However, ""he is not in any of the therapy or treatment facilities at the prison,"" said Terri Thornton, a California Department of Corrections spokeswoman. Spector is housed in a ""sensitive-needs yard"" at the prison -- the largest prison by area in the state. It functions like a general population yard, Thornton said, ""but it is for inmates with safety concerns, such as celebrities, gang dropouts or those whose crimes make them a target of other prisoners."" Spector's accommodations are standard, with the exception that the cells are slightly larger to accommodate wheelchairs should inmates need them, which he does not, prison spokesman Steven Smith said. There are several therapy and education programs for inmates, but Thornton said she is not sure whether Spector will participate in them. Inmates who do can work toward a modest reduction of their sentences. Spector is not the first celebrity to serve a sentence at the facility south of Fresno; actor Robert Downey Jr. served time there in 1999 for probation violation of a drug charge. The California Substance Abuse and Treatment Facility and State Prison houses 6,919 inmates. Although it is in Corcoran, it is a separate facility from Corcoran State Prison, where Charles Manson is serving his life sentence.","Music producer was sentenced to 19 years to life in actress' death .

"(CNN) -- Planetary nebula Abell 33 has taken on romantic proportions. The European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope has captured a spectacular image of a planetary nebula aligned with a star in such a way that it looks like a diamond engagement ring. Abell 33 came from a star that's going to become a white dwarf, which is one way that a star can evolve at the end of its life. White dwarfs are small, dense and hot, and they cool down over billions of years. The star entering this last phase of its life blows off its atmosphere into space. This results in glowing gas clouds known as planetary nebulae, such as this one that looks like a round bubble or ring. In the image, the original star appears in the center of the blue bubble. It is more luminous than our sun, and its ultraviolet radiation gives a glow to the ring of atmosphere that has been cast out. Scientists are not yet sure if it's actually a double star or just a chance alignment in the image. It's not common for a planetary nebula to be as perfectly round as this one. The symmetry of a planetary nebula is usually disturbed -- for example, by the way its star spins or if there are multiple stars in the system. As for the ""diamond"" in this image, it's a different star called HD 83535, which happened to align with the nebula in this image. Abell 33 is about 2,500 light-years away, so no one will be coming near it anytime soon. It's as if the universe liked the star and put a ring on it. Astronomers find first asteroid with rings .

"(CNN) -- A suicide bomber hit an African Union Mission in Somalia convoy on Monday, killing 16 people, Lower Shabelle Gov. Adukadir Mohamed Sidi said. Sidi said the explosion destroyed two buses traveling behind the military convoy, which was transporting the governor as he traveled back from Mogadishu. The blast killed 16 civilians and injured 22 people, including two soldiers, he said. The Al-Shabaab terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack and said Americans and South Africans were among those killed. The bombing comes a week after a U.S. airstrike claimed the life of the group's leader, Ahmed Godane. The group appointed a new leader last week and said Godane's death would not stop its attacks.

"(CNN) -- Robert De Niro has always liked to keep a bit of himself hidden from view. ""I've never been one of those actors who has touted myself as a fascinating human being,"" he reportedly once said. ""I had to decide early on whether I was to be an actor or a personality."" Of course, the modern celebrity-industrial complex being what it is, he didn't get much of a choice. In hindsight, it's hard to remember a time when De Niro, who turns 70 on Saturday, wasn't Robert De Niro, with his movie star image -- brusque, intense, Italian, New Yorky -- front and center. (In real life, De Niro -- despite his name -- is a mix of ethnicities, including German, Dutch and Irish, though he identifies most closely with his Italian heritage.) But that wasn't always the case. In the first two decades of his career, he generally disappeared into roles as smoothly and casually as putting on a new suit. You know them all, of course. The brash, manic Johnny Boy in ""Mean Streets,"" the first of his many Martin Scorsese collaborations. The ailing, slow-witted catcher in ""Bang the Drum Slowly."" ""Godfather II's"" young Vito Corleone. ""Taxi Driver's"" Travis Bickle. Jake LaMotta (""Raging Bull""), Rupert Pupkin (""The King of Comedy""), Al Capone (""The Untouchables""), Jimmy Conway (""Goodfellas"") -- all chips of a multifaceted, diamond-bright talent. Oscar-winning, too: He took home the statue for 1974's ""The Godfather: Part II"" and 1980's ""Raging Bull"" and has been nominated five other times. Those early characters often had something in common. Some were gangsters. Some had hair-trigger tempers. (""You talkin' to me?"") There were often hints of hardscrabble lives aching for success, even in cases where they'd achieved it. (Behind the eyes of De Niro's Corleone, long after he starts wearing tailored clothes, are the haunted memories of tenement flats and Ellis Island.) Why we can't get enough of the gangster life . Still, there was always a sense of mystery. The 5-foot-9 actor had that mesmerizing ability to seem taller or shorter, depending on the role. He famously plowed himself into the Method, gaining and losing weight for ""Raging Bull,"" driving a cab for ""Taxi Driver"" and learning saxophone for ""New York, New York."" He kept viewers off balance with occasional comic turns, whether it was as a cheerful repairman in ""Brazil"" or the exasperated bounty hunter in ""Midnight Run."" It's no wonder Bananarama had a song called ""Robert De Niro's Waiting,"" in which they fantasized about escaping with this enigmatic leading man, ""talking Italian."" But, more recently, he has been Robert De Niro, the image taking the lead. Given his obvious acting abilities, sometimes it has gotten a little wearying. Why is Robert De Niro in ""Showtime"" and ""15 Minutes""? Who talked Robert De Niro into ""The Fan,"" ""The Score"" and ""Righteous Kill""? Can't he work with Scorsese again? What happened to the mystery? Well, the guy does have a movie festival, some restaurants and a hotel to support. Besides, the actor still gets his turns. He was a shambling spin doctor in ""Wag the Dog,"" the creature in ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" Fearless Leader in ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" a parodistic don in ""Analyze This"" and ""Analyze That,"" and the ramrod ex-CIA agent in the ""Fockers"" series. He has even started showing a little more of himself. He broke down while discussing last year's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" on Katie Couric's talk show. And whether Robert De Niro or Robert De Niro, he's been a steady presence. The guy's always working: more than 80 films since 1968, with seven this year alone -- including ""American Hustle"" with director David O. Russell, who directed De Niro's Oscar-nominated performance in ""Playbook."" He promises more to come. After all, he's only 70. ""I might like to do things that are more retiring,"" he reflected in 2011. ""But not retire. As long as I'm enjoying what I'm doing, why retire?"" Why, indeed? Birthdays are full of surprises.","Famed, much-lauded actor Robert De Niro turns 70 on Saturday .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Can Lee Kai Fu make innovation work in China? Lee is the former president of Google in China who left the Internet search giant last Fall just months before the company's high profile scuffle with the Chinese government over censorship rules and alleged hacker attacks. That furor raised Lee's international profile, but the 48-year-old is now fully focused on the future, hoping to inject a new spirit of innovation into Chinese business with his investment and incubation company Innovation Works. ""People expect Innovation Works to be magical,"" said Lee during an interview with CNN in June at his company's offices, located just across the street from Google's China headquarters. ""The great anticipation outside of Innovation Works is both a pressure for us as well as something that excites people. I want to make a plea for people not to expect miracles."" That pressure comes as Lee has a good track record in the West and a reputation, especially among young Chinese, as a business role model. Originally from Taiwan, Lee studied computer science at Columbia University in New York and later earned a doctorate in the same field from Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University where he was also a lecturer. He then worked for Apple and moved to China in 1998 to head up Microsoft's Research division in Beijing. In 2005, he joined Google to lead the company's operations in China. While Google's share of the Chinese search market increased from nearly nothing to around 30 percent under Lee's watch, some questioned his leadership skills and whether his exit was influenced by an early knowledge that Google would announce in January potential plans to close its Chinese operations. ""I don't think he should be held responsible for the existing circumstances of Google in China,"" said Keso, a Beijing-based tech blogger who traveled with Lee to Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters in 2006. ""If there's blame, Google's choice to enter the Chinese market might have just been a mistake from the very beginning."" Even so, Lee's legacy with Google is one that remains with him today and won't fade anytime soon. However he's reluctant to talk about his former employer. ""I can never please any audiences with what I have to say [about Google],"" Lee told CNN. ""So, I would rather not talk about it."" Instead Lee would rather talk about is his efforts to foster a mentality that values long-term success rather than instant riches and the need to reform a Chinese education system that focuses on rote memorization over individualistic, out-of-the-box thinking. In addition to the four books Lee has authored on such subjects, he also regularly lectures at Chinese universities and has become something of a mentor to many students. ""I have had a certain impact at Microsoft and Google, but the larger impact have been the lectures and the books,"" Lee said. ""I don't think I have been particularly profound, but I think people need guidance and mentorship at a very confusing time."" Lee and his staff offer young Chinese entrepreneurs, engineers and project managers financial support and guidance to help them build companies and launch products for China's 400 million Internet users and 700 million mobile subscribers. Since Innovation Works was launched, it has received 100,000 resumes, reviewed 500 business plans and amassed around $115 million in funds from investors, Lee said. Today, it has 200 staff members and is incubating 12 start-ups, five of which Lee unveiled to journalists earlier this week during a tour of a new office space the investment company will move into later this month. He also unveiled five of the companies Innovation Works are supporting and the products they are developing for the Chinese market. The projects, heavily focused towards mobile Internet, e-commerce and cloud computing, included an Android operating system called Tapas with features tailored for Chinese handset users. ""An early stage entrepreneur who wants to build up companies will face a lot of trouble in China,"" Lee told reporters. ""It is not as good as it seems. Even though you hear a lot about the start-up world being wonderful, they face a lot of trouble."" Some investors question whether Lee, who has never been an entrepreneur himself, has what it takes to help new companies succeed. ""A common perception is he is Google and he is a professional manager and pretty much has been his entire life and never really run a start-up before and never done investing before,"" said an investor who declined to be identified due to his firm's interest the companies Innovation Works is incubating. ""It is going to be tough for him."" Others are concerned the start-ups Lee is coaching may not be able to survive in the harsh business climate of China where many deals are won under-the-table and profits are sometimes earned in down-and-dirty ways. ""I don't think they can take the low ground because they have the burden to always be taking the higher ground,"" said another investor who also declined to be identified. ""Most businesses in China make money doing business in gray areas or crossing lines. [Innovation Works] will always have to take the higher ground, which means they may never be making as much money as competitors. ""I think it will be innovation at work, which is not Innovation Works. But we have to give Lee the benefit of the doubt."" Yet for Lee, the benefits he says Incubation Works is imparting to young entrepreneurs is far more important than the doubts anyone may have about him, the company and the success it may or may not have beyond its offices here in Beijing. ""Even if our result is not brilliant, or it is not changing the world, I am very certain the people who come out of here will be better people because of what we have done,"" he said. ""I do think in the end it is the result that will tell the story.""","Former boss of Google in China has new business called Innovation Works .

"(CNN) -- The family of American Steven Sotloff had a message Wednesday for the notorious leader of the terror group ISIS, asking him to answer for the sin he committed with the beheading of the journalist. Sotloff's family broke its silence the same day U.S. intelligence officials said the videotaped execution was authentic. ""I have a message for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" family spokesman Barak Barfi told reporters in Arabic, reading from a statement. ""Where is your mercy?"" ""Wayluk,"" Barfi said, using an Arabic phrase that roughly translates to committing a great sin. The statement went on to cite passages from the Quran, asking al-Baghdadi why he violated the tenets. ""I am here debating you with kindness. I don't have a sword in my hand, and I am ready for your answer,"" according to the statement read by Barfi. In English, Barfi told reporters gathered outside the Sotloff family's home in Miami: ""Today, we grieve. This week, we mourn. But we will emerge from this ordeal ... We will not allow our enemies to hold us hostage with the sole weapons they possess, fear."" 'We will not forget' The statement came just hours after President Barack Obama said the United States will not be intimidated by the killers of two American journalists. ""Those who make the mistake of harming Americans will learn that we will not forget ... that our reach is long and that justice will be served,"" Obama said during a news conference in Estonia, where he was meeting with leaders of the Baltic nations. The killing is the second beheading of an American journalist in two weeks, and the militant group said it's a result of Obama's decision to conduct airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. The goal of the United States is to ""degrade and destroy"" the capabilities of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, ""it's not contain,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CNN's Jim Sciutto. ""It makes you sick to your stomach, but it again reminds you of the brutality and barbarism that is afoot in some places in the world,"" Hagel said. ""... It won't just recede into the gray recesses of history until we stop it."" Journalists most at risk . Hagel: Options on the table . All options -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- are on the table to address the threat posed by ISIS, Hagel said. Those options include possible airstrikes in Syria, where ISIS has established a stronghold in and around the northeastern city of Raqqa. But there is a question of just how long it will take to defeat ISIS. ""This, as the President has said, is going to have to be a sustained effort. And it's going to take time, and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Vice President Joe Biden added his own voice to the calls for justice, saying the United States will pursue the killers ""to the gates of hell."" ""As a nation, we are united, and when people harm Americans, we don't retreat, we don't forget,"" he said at an appearance near Portsmouth, New Hampshire. ""We take care of those who are grieving. And when that's finished, they should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice, because hell is where they will reside. Hell is where they will reside."" The video . The video of Sotloff's execution was posted online Tuesday. In a scene eerily similar to an earlier video of the death of U.S journalist James Foley, Sotloff kneels in the desert, dressed in an orange prison-style jumpsuit. A masked ""executioner"" lords over him, wielding a knife. ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy toward the Islamic State,"" the executioner says. ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" The executioner appears to be the same person, and the location of the two killings appears to be similar, probably in or around Raqqa, one of the safest areas for ISIS, said Peter Neumann, a professor at King's College London. ""It is almost the exact same choreography,"" Neumann said. The journalist speaks; the executioner speaks. Then the victim is beheaded. In the video released Tuesday, a British hostage is shown after the beheading of Sotloff, just as Sotloff was shown in Foley's video. British rescue attempt . The UK said it attempted to rescue one of its citizens held by ISIS ""some time ago"" but failed. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works. ""You wouldn't expect me to discuss various options that we will be considering,"" he said. ""But I can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person."" Britain echoed the same sentiment as Obama. ""This country will never give into terrorism ... a country like ours will not be cowed by these barbaric killers,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said. This summer, several dozen of the most elite U.S. commandos flew into Syria but couldn't find the hostages, including Sotloff and Foley, a U.S. official told CNN last month. 'Degrade and destroy' Speaking Wednesday, Obama addressed his much-criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS. He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that ""might"" require congressional approval. ""Our objective is clear. That is to degrade and destroy (ISIS) so it's no longer a threat,"" he said. ""We can accomplish that. It's going to take some time, it's going to take some effort."" Obama said the world needs a regional strategy to defeat the group. ""We've been putting together a strategy that was designed to do a number of things. ... What we have to make sure is we have a regional strategy in place,"" he said. How will Obama respond to ISIS? Remembering Steven Sotloff . Maps: Where do jihadis come from?

"Bangkok (CNN) -- The woman set to become Thailand's first female prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, said Monday that authorities will reopen an investigation into her brother, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was convicted of corruption after being forced from office. Yingluck Shinawatra's Pheu Thai party dominated the country's general election on Sunday, winning 265 seats in the 500-member parliament. It was a major victory for the party once headed by her brother, who was exiled after a military coup threw him from power in 2006. He left the country two years later, after he was convicted of conflict of interest charges. He was sentenced in absentia to two years' imprisonment. In her first one-on-one interview with an international media organization after all the votes had been counted, Shinawatra told CNN's Sara Sidner she would not encourage her brother, who lives in Dubai, to return to Thailand to serve his sentence. She said she did not know whether her brother was wrongly convicted but that a truth and reconciliation commission plans to review the case against him and several others. Thaksin Shinawatra, meanwhile, spoke Monday about his sister's status as the country's next prime minister. ""I'm proud of her and I trust her,"" he told reporters in the United Arab Emirates. When asked whether he expects his sister to clear the way for his return, the former prime minister said, ""Going back home is not a major concern. It's not a top priority. The priority is to bring back reconciliation."" Many hope that Sunday's general election -- the first since 2007 -- will bring an end to years of unrest between two political factions that climaxed last year with deadly protests.  Yingluck won: What's next for Thailand? Tensions between the Democratic Party and the Pheu Thai party, which reflect deep divisions within Thai society, erupted in 2010, with protests against Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's government leading to a military crackdown. More than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured. After the riots, the Thai government pledged to work toward a process of national reconciliation to heal class and political divisions, though the divide between the two groups remains wide. The other coalition parties include Chart Thai Pattana, Chart Pattana Puea Pandin, Palang Chon and Mahachon. ""Now we have a good number of 299 representatives,"" Yingluck Shinawatra said. ""It is enough to have stability to serve (the) Thai people."" Thailand's Democratic Party won 159 of the seats, the country's electoral commission said Monday, though the final, official results have not been released. Abhisit, the prime minister, announced he is stepping down as the head of the Democratic Party after its loss at the polls. ""When compared with the result of (the) election in 2007 with this year's election, we have less MPs,"" Abhisit said via the Thai news agency MCOT. ""I think that I need to take this responsibility, so today I decided to resign from the leader position of the (Democratic) party, and I will let the party choose a new leader in 90 days."" Yingluck Shinawatra said Monday that reconciliation is ""the urgent task ahead."" She has also vowed that her first priority would be to ""help people on their economic situation.""   Can election promises be kept in Thailand? Thai stocks jumped more than 3%, or 33 points, at opening on Monday. The election had more than a 70% turnout rate, the country's election commission said. ""We congratulate the people of the Kingdom of Thailand, our long-time friend and ally, for their robust participation in the July 3rd parliamentary elections,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement. Thaksin remains one of Thailand's most polarizing political figures. Even from afar, he has been a topic of discussion during the election and its aftermath. He still denies the accusations that led to his 2008 corruption conviction. Yingluck Shinawatra's critics worry she will simply do her brother's bidding -- something she has denied. Before she even gave a victory speech, her brother shared his comments from exile in Dubai. ""Well, I would tell them that I really want to go back, but I will wait for the right moment and the right situation,"" he told reporters. But on Monday, Thaksin Shinawatra said his return would be contingent on reconciliation. ""If I were to go back, I should be part of the solution,"" he told reporters. ""I should not be part of the problems."" He stressed that he is no longer head of the party; his sister is. The Pheu Thai party remains fiercely behind the former prime minister and wants him to return. But the so-called ""Yellow Shirts,"" a group that formed to oust him from power, has said it will do whatever it can to stop that from happening. Yingluck Shinawatra said she won't give her brother favorable treatment. ""I can't do anything special for my brother,"" she said, adding she will follow the ""rule of law."" Thaksin said the incoming prime minister's relative lack of political experience might help with reconciliation efforts. Sometimes, he said, ""you need (a) clean slate. If you were to have the people with a lot of political baggage come to reconciliation, it may be difficult."" But many Thai voters were more concerned with economic issues, wanting their leaders to shrink the gap between what they earn and the skyrocketing cost of living. ""Free education is good, care for (the) elderly is also good. In fact every parties' policies are all good, the question is if they would ever implement them,"" Banorn Achriyawatkul said as she worked outside a polling station. After being laid off from her job as a secretary, the mother of four is now trying to make ends meet as a food vendor in the streets. Despite the animosity between them, the two major parties have made very similar promises to the people: a better economy, free education, and a major increase in the minimum wage -- exactly what many voters wanted to hear. But analysts say the extravagant programs will cost more than Thailand can afford. Supong Limtanakool of Bangkok University's Center for Strategic Studies said both parties made big promises they just can't keep. He said Thailand will ""have to spend somewhere between an additional 1.5 trillion baht to 7.5 trillion baht ($49 billion to $244 billion) with all the extravagant programs, which is five times the national budget. ... I mean, we'll be broke in one year,"" he said. CNN's Sara Sidner, Leone Lakhani and Benjamin Gottlieb contributed to this report.","Incoming prime minister says case against her brother will be reviewed .

"(CNN) -- A moderate 5.3-magnitude earthquake that rattled southern Colorado early Tuesday morning was the largest to hit the state in more than 40 years, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake's epicenter was seven miles southwest of Cokedale, and 180 miles south of Denver. There were no immediate reports of casualties. A dispatcher at the sheriff's office in Las Animas County, which includes Cokedale, said the quake lasted almost 30 seconds. The office received reports of rocks falling on a highway and of some structure damage. It was the largest in a series of earthquakes that struck the area. As of 5 a.m. local time (7 a.m. ET), the USGS reported seven quakes centered just south of Cokedale since midnight. Amy Vaughan of the USGS said the 5.3 magnitude ties that of an earthquake Colorado suffered on August 9, 1967. In 1973, the USGS originally reported a quake with a magnitude of 5.7, but it turned out that was caused by an explosion, Vaughan said. The largest recorded quake to hit Colorado had a magnitude of 6.5 on Nov. 7, 1882, near Rocky Mountain National Park, Vaughan said. CNN's Samuel Gardner III and Josh Levs also contributed to this report.","The 5.3-magnitude quake ties a quake in 1967 .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Anti-government protesters called off a rally they had planned for Tuesday because of an immense military presence on the streets of Bangkok. ""We are not going to mobilize to anywhere because there are too many soldiers on the street,"" said Nattawut Saikua, a leader with the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD). ""We are afraid we could lose position."" The Thai military has stationed about 1,500 troops along a Bangkok road amid anticipation of renewed clashes with the protesters who are demanding that the prime minister dissolve the government, hold new elections and leave the country. The road, Silom Road, is considered a city financial center and home to some of the nation's largest companies. The protesters, called 'Red Shirts,' had planned to march to Silom from Ratchaprasong intersection at the heart of Bangkok's commercial center. Demonstrators from across the country have camped out by the thousands at the intersection for days. Are you there? Share your story, images . On Tuesday, the protesters reversed their rally call on the chance that troops might move in and take over the intersection. The Red Shirts are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. They have been demanding that current Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve parliament and call new elections. Explainer: What are the protests in Thailand about? Red Shirts leader Weng Tojirakarn has said the group wants Abhisit to leave the country. At least 25 people were killed and more than 850 wounded in police-protester clashes earlier this month. On Friday, Abhisit handed security operations entirely to the country's military after three protest leaders escaped from a hotel that was surrounded by security forces. ""The important problem now is the terrorism,"" Abhisit said, referring to what authorities describe as a terrorist group mixing among the protesters. He spoke in a televised broadcast following three days of silence amid the tumult in his country. The prime minister weeks ago announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and nearby areas.","NEW: Anti-government protesters call off a rally they had planned for Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- American golfer Dustin Johnson has announced he is to take a break from the sport and will seek ""professional help"" to improve his mental health. The world No. 16 pulled out of the WBC-Bridgestone Invitational due to personal reasons earlier this week and will now not contest next week's U.S. PGA Championship at Valhalla or the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, Scotland, in September. A statement from Johnson's management company read: ""I am taking a leave of absence from professional golf, effective immediately. I will use this time to seek professional help for personal challenges I have faced. ""By committing the time and resources necessary to improve my mental health, physical well-being and emotional foundation, I am confident that I will be better equipped to fulfill my potential and become a consistent champion."" The 30-year-old has won eight titles on the PGA Tour and is highly regarded by fans and fellow professionals for his big hitting game. He is currently ranked fifth in the standings of U.S. golfers, meaning he would almost certainly have been an automatic pick for the Ryder Cup. Johnson was also the only player in the American team to remain undefeated when Europe retained the trophy after a dramatic final day comeback at Medinah in 2012. Reacting to the announcement Friday, U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson told the PGA website: ""We will certainly miss Dustin Johnson at Gleneagles, and we wish him the best. ""As one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3-0 at Medinah in 2012, he has clearly been an asset for the United States team. That said, the United States is a team with an abundance of talent."" Tiger Woods added to his captain's words. ""I'll tell you what, with his power, you always want guys with that kind of power to play on any team. I've been his partner in the Presidents Cup in Australia, and the fire power that he has, it's pretty cool to be around,"" said the 14-time major winner. ""It's not too often you see a guy carry the ball 320 (yards) without even trying, and then when he steps on it he can hit it even further. When he gets it going, it's awfully impressive."" Former U.S. Open champion and European Ryder Cup opponent Justin Rose also passed on his regards to his friend and colleague. ""I just wish him well, whatever he's facing right now,"" Rose said in quotes carried by UK news agency, the Press Association. ""(It) can't be easy for him. I wish him all the best. He's a friend of mine (but I) didn't really know that that was on the cards."" Johnson recently finished 12th in the British Open after heading out in the final pairing with eventual winner Rory McIlroy. He rounded off his statement by requesting privacy in the months ahead as he begins his time off. ""I respectfully ask my fans, well-wishers and the media for privacy as I embark upon this mission of self-improvement,"" he said.","Dustin Johnson announces he will take break from golf .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- A ""devastated"" Simon Monjack told PEOPLE his wife Brittany Murphy did not overdose on drugs and did not suffer from an eating disorder. ""These rumors that she was anorexic? It's crazy -- she was slim, but that was her natural physique,"" Monjack told PEOPLE. ""This is what's killing all of us? How did it happen? Her mum, myself and her family -- we want to know why we lost our baby."" During a sometimes tear-filled interview, an exhausted Monjack, 39, who hasn't slept since his mother-in-law found his wife collapsed in the bathroom early Sunday, said all he knows is what doctors told him at the hospital: She died of cardiac arrest, but they won't know details until after an autopsy. (A coroner's spokesperson said the results could take up to six weeks, for toxicology reports to be final.) ""My initial reaction to the autopsy was -- they're going to cut her open -- I couldn't bear it,"" Monjack said, weeping. ""That would break her mother, but we realized we needed to know. I look forward to getting the results."" He added that his wife of three years did suffer from a heart murmur (mitral valve prolapse), which can cause fatigue, dizziness and irregular heartbeats -- but is generally not life threatening. Murphy didn't require medication to treat it, says Monjack. But on Saturday, he said, his wife was ill, resting in bed all day suffering from laryngitis, which the actress treated with herbal tea, ginger and lemon. ""She was on herbal remedies that wouldn't speed up her heart,"" Monjack said. ""There was nothing here that could endanger her; there was prescription medication in the house for her female time and some cough syrup. That was it."" Asked point-blank if a drug overdose was a possible cause of death, Monjack replied, ""I can get rid of that one right now,"" he said. Last Saturday, the couple just relaxed in bed, watching three movies as Murphy prepared to cast her vote as a member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. They ordered Brittany's favorite takeout -- Thai food -- and ate soup prepared by Murphy's mother, Sharon, who has lived with them for 3½ years. ""She was tired and a little sad because she was sick,"" Monjack said about Brittany. ""She wore her pink Beverly Hills Hotel robe and monkey pajamas. We saw It's Complicated, Public Enemy and The Princess and the Frog. The couple were joined by Murphy's companion, a pet Maltese named Clara, a Christmas gift last year from Monjack that Murphy named after her favorite silent screen star, Clara Bow. ""One of the saddest things is that Clara has looked everywhere for Brittany and can't find her,"" said Monjack. Monjack, a photographer, first met Murphy on a photo shoot when she was 13 after she moved to Hollywood with her mother, Sharon. They began dating after being reintroduced at Murphy's 28th birthday party and married a year later. ""So many people have their views of us, but they never met us or sat down with us,"" he said. ""I'm not perfect, but I don't think anyone is ... I am feeling beyond devastated. I was in love with Brittany and Brittany with me."" The couple had plans for 2010: Brittany would continue to work, but she wanted to get pregnant. ""She was an only child,"" said Monjack. ""She wanted a baby. Her big dream next year was to have a child, and we talked about how he or she would look. She'd say, 'They'd better have your eyes and lips and my hair.' "" But Monjack did concede his wife was trying to get heavier. ""She tried to gain weight but had one of those metabolisms -- a high metabolism -- but enjoyed food as much as anyone. I wish I could show all the receipts from the take out restaurants,"" he said. ""We are faced with this ridiculous reality that people out there believe she felt, 'Oh, poor me, I'm fat, I'm thin.' Brittany didn't see beauty as a physical thing, which I'm bloody lucky for,"" he said with a laugh. ""I know there was a disparity in how we looked and I'm no movie star, but she always saw the person."" Monjack said he has been upset by some of the published reports. ""It's horrible -- the death of a beautiful young woman, a Hollywood icon; it has to be explained. It just can't be a tragic accident,"" he said, trying to explain the headlines. ""We don't want to accept that a beautiful young wife and daughter woke up one morning and died a tragic death."" But he's most worried about his mother-in-law. ""I don't know if she will ever recover, and I know when she reads all this nonsense about her son-in-law and her deceased daughter, her heart is breaking. She has lived with us and saw the love and support. I hope she stays -- I can't imagine my life without Sharon -- she's my link to Brittany."" Monjack said Brittany's family arrived in town Monday and that funeral plans are pending. © 2011 People and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Finding enough capital to give a burgeoning business its best shot of success is a challenge that faces many budding entrepreneurs. So when Mariano Kostalec heard about the Start-Up Chile initiative, he was intrigued. The government funded project offers high potential global start-ups a $40,000 investment. No equity is ceded and the only requirement is that at least one member of the team remains in the country for six months. The aim is to turn Santiago into South America's Silicon Valley. ""Looking at what's happening in Argentina at the moment my expectations were actually quite low in a sense,"" Mariano told CNN's Rosie Tomkins. ""So I came here and I've been actually quite impressed with the country, with the way you can come here and you can set up your business and you know things are going to work the way they tell you. ""You can actually trust people and that's really important."" Mariono's company Uniplaces - an online platform that connects students with landlords - was one of hundreds selected through a specialized admission process conducted by Silicon Valley experts and the Chilean Innovation Board. By the end of Start-Up Chile's first phase in 2014 it will have provided grants to 1,000 firms for a total of $40 million. Its critics say it's a waste of government funding, and won't produce any long term benefits. It's a claim the Chilean President Sebastian Pinera refutes. He said: ""We're importing and bringing to Chile people that have good ideas, entrepreneurship capacity and the ability to start a business here. ""What they will teach to our people is very, very valuable."" Pinera's goal is to brand Chile as South America's innovation and entrepreneurial hub. The government claims one quarter of those taking part in the project are likely to stay on once their time is up. If they remain in Santiago they'll help bolster confidence in Start-Up Chile and stimulate the economy. If they go, they help spread the word that Chile is open for enterprise and innovation. It's a direction the country has been moving in for decades. It became the first South American nation to join the OECD in 2010 -- an international organization set up to stimulate democracy and free markets. John Njoko, the founder of Kwelia, a real estate analysis company, has also reaped the benefits of the Start-Up Chile Project. ""On the corners and on the margins there's still room for improvement,"" he said. ""We had very limited expectations. But we came here and we needed to build, and we put our heads down and we built."" Such hardworking attitudes are music to Sebastian Pinera's ears. He firmly believes the key to Chile's future success centers around building ties with other countries through business. ""I think that's the right path for Chile to become a developed country,"" he said. A previous version of this story stated Start Up Chile required entrepreneurs to open an office in Chile to qualify. This is not the case.","$40,000 investment, working visa and office space offered to high potential companies .

"(CNN) -- In what comes as little surprise for a conservative group of justices who have increasingly sided with corporate America's interests, the Supreme Court has just made it harder to form certain kinds of unions in America. And the ruling may lead to future challenges for other unions down the road. The court ruled that home health care workers in Illinois do not qualify fully as public employees, so they aren't required to contribute fees for a public sector employee union. The Harris v. Quinn ruling highly criticized, but did not overturn, the precedent that many public sector workers can form unions and must pay certain union fees. But the groundwork for future challenges was laid. Collective bargaining is at the heart of unions, the idea that instead of each employee individually negotiating for his or her wages alone â€” facing off against better-positioned and resourced managers â€” the employees join to ""collectively bargain"" for pay and other conditions. Employees working together can get far more information, and a group of workers has far more bargaining power than one worker alone. We know it works. Unions raise wages of employees by roughly 20% and raise total compensation (including benefits) by 28%, even after union dues are factored into the equation. Even nonunion workers benefit: Workers in union-friendly states earn, on average, $120 more a week than workers in anti-union states. A high school graduate working in a field that is 25% unionized earns 5% more than similar workers in less unionized fields. When union density goes up, income equality goes down. ""Everyone in this country should have the freedom to join together and bargain collectively for fair wages, benefits and safe jobs,"" said Sarita Gupta, executive director of Jobs with Justice, in response to the ruling. ""Unions are one of the last remaining checks on corporate power, so it's no surprise that corporate-backed extreme special interests are attempting to effectively end unions as we know them."" Under existing law, a workplace union is formed when a majority of the employees vote in favor. But the union is obligated to represent all workers, including the ones who voted no. In exchange for this service, a service with clear financial advantages for workers, unions are authorized to require all employees in the unit to pay their fair share of the union's costs. In the past, the Supreme Court agreed all this is perfectly fine, provided that unions only charge nonunion employees for the costs associated with collective bargaining and other services that will directly benefit them: the ""fair share"" fee. Other union activity, including political lobbying and electoral work, must come from discretionary contributions. Enter Harris v. Quinn. The case involves workers in Illinois who provide in-home care to people living with disabilities. The lead plaintiff, Pam Harris, provides essential and constant care to her disabled son, Josh. Illinois allows recipients of disability benefits to contract with anyone they choose, including family members, and have them modestly compensated for their work in providing care. And so Josh contracted with his mom to be his caregiver. Illinois sets and pays wages for workers like Harris through Medicaid, which is why a state law considered them ""public employees"" for purposes of collective bargaining with the state. The collective bargaining agreement between the unions that represent these workers, mainly SEIU and AFSCME, and the state of Illinois includes a ""fair share"" provision â€” so nonunion members must pay a union fee. Notably, Pam Harris is not a member of a unit that is represented by a union, but she sued over the ""fair share"" fee nonetheless. As Harris told NPR's Nina Totenberg, ""I object to my home being a union or workplace."" Except her home isn't part of a union agreement. And as for objecting to being ""a workplace,"" one has to wonder whether Harris objects to being paid for her work. Facts aside, the powerful anti-union organizations and donors behind this lawsuit argue that ""fair share"" fees to a public sector union are by definition political because the union is negotiating with the government as employer. In a ruling that seems narrowly tailored but carries broad implications, the court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the home health aides are only ""partial public employees"" and don't have to pay. The danger here is that anti-union interests could try to pigeonhole other types of employees into this new Harris exception and start to chip away at the legal rights of other workers to form unions. This is the goal behind the Harris suit in the first place. The ruling may not be as broad as anti-union big-business interests had hoped, but they will use any inch to advance their miles-long agenda of destroying public- and private-sector unions in America, taking away wages and protections for hardworking Americans and removing any checks and balances on the power of big business. After all, this case really isn't about Pam Harris or the well-being of workers. If that was the case, given how much unions improve wages and working conditions for Americans, then conservatives would be strong supporters. No, this case is about unraveling the power of public-sector and private-sector unions more broadly to stop them demanding decent wages and benefits for workers in the face of otherwise-unchecked corporate windfalls of power and money. Corporations have a vested interest in political inequality. In an electoral system corrupted by money, unions plainly pose the biggest challenge to big-money donors on the right. In the 2012 elections, the oil industry titans David and Charles Koch spent more than $412 million through individual contributions, PACs and shadowy outside organizations on conservative causes. They are by far the greatest financial influence in our money-driven political system. And yet, the top 10 unions in America spent a combined $153 million in 2012, nowhere near equal to what the Koches spent. But they remain a thorn in their side, arguing for raising the minimum wage and green energy. If union membership shrinks, the power of unions to counterbalance big corporate money in elections also shrinks. Which is why the Koch Brothers and other big right wing political donors are behind the Harris lawsuit. The Harris case is in line with the Citizens United ruling that gave corporations the same free speech rights as individual people, and the McCutcheon ruling that eliminated the cap on overall individual political contributions. Every day across America, firefighters and police and home health aides and nurses work hard to keep us healthy and safe. This decision is a dangerous step in the wrong direction of eroding the basic freedom of all workers to stand together to demand better wages and working conditions, which is good for their families, good for our communities and good for our economy. The only thing unions aren't good for is big business --- which is exactly why big business has co-opted the Supreme Court to undermine unions.","Supreme Court rules home health care workers not required to pay public sector union fees .
