Legendary music mogul Quincy Jones has been roped into a nasty alleged murder plot between a Las Vegas tycoon and the creator of Girls Gone Wild, court papers allege. Mr Jones, who is the most nominated Grammy artist of all time, has been called to testify in the case between Joe Francis, the creator of the adult entertainment video empire, and Steve Wynn, who among other things, owns the hotel where Prince Harry was notoriously caught partying last weekend. Court documents allege that Wynn threatened to kill Francis and hide his remains in the desert, and that Mr Jones may have seen an email detailing the alleged plot. Roped in: Legendary music stalwart Quincy Jones has reportedly been called as a witness in a bitter legal battle between a Vegas casino owner and an adult entertainment millionaire . Legal battle: Wynn Casino owner Steve Wynn, left, is embroiled in a legal battle with Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis, who recently had to pay the billionaire $7.5million in punitive damages . The email allegedly plotted to have Francis killed and buried in the desert over money he supposedly owes the casino, TMZ exclusively reported. However, Wynn, 70, insists that no such email exists. Mr Jones will testify next week as to what he saw, the celebrity gossip website reported. The court documents state Mr Jones will be a witness for the Las Vegas mogul, who is worth an estimated $2.5billion, according to Forbes. In February, TMZ reported that a judge ordered Francis to pay Wynn $7.5million over a defamation lawsuit in which Francis publically accused Wynn and his many casinos of being deceptive to guests. In the complaint, Wynn alleged that Francis uttered slanderous words about his business. Sin City: Wynn owns the now-infamous Wynn Hotel, where Prince Harry spent a highly-publicised weekend partying . The judge in the case said that Francis’ actions damaged Wynn’s reputation and made him pay $5million, adding a further $2.5million in punitive damages. Francis, who has an estimated $150million net worth, has had many brush-ins with the law in the past, many of them tied up in his Girls Gone Wild Empire. Included in the complaints were not getting consent of the girls he filmed flashing their breasts, exploitation of minors, and keeping incomplete records. According to Forbes, the young millionaire has also been indicted for tax evasion, and has been convicted of child abuse and prostitution. The father of actress and comedian Rashida Jones, Mr Jones has 26 Grammy awards and 76 nominations. He is expected to testify at the trial this week.","Vegas casino billionaire Steve Wynn has reportedly called in music mogul Quincy Jones to testify for him .

As the record-breaking racehorse Frankel galloped to the finish line, the crowd roared in delight - but many were simply cheering its legendary trainer who is battling cancer. The unbeaten colt put on a brilliant display in the Juddmonte International Stakes at York - and all under the emotional eye of trainer Sir Hery Cecil. Trainer Sir Henry was given a standing ovation himself after he returned following chemotherapy to watch Frankel achieve its winning record to 13. He said he was determined to see the horse stretch to victory after missing its last race. Ridden by Tom Queally, the 1-10 favourite passed the finish line seven lengths clear, receiving three cheers. Wearing a sombre black hat, the great trainer's voice has been reduced to a whisper due to illness picked up as a side-effect of his cancer treatment, and he spoke only briefly. 'That was great, wasn't it?' he said. 'It's fantastic. It's great for Yorkshire, they are very supportive of racing and they deserve to see him.' Asked how it made him feel, the trainer said: 'Twenty years better.' Sir Henry was knighted in 2011 for services to horse racing and is widely regarded as one of the greatest trainers to have ever graced the Turf. Trainer Sir Henry, who missed Frankel's last win at the Sussex States at Glorious Goodwood on August 1, has stated the Champion Stakes at Ascot would be his preferred route for Frankel to finish his career. But the prize horse won with such ease . over an extended mile and a quarter that he is just 1-4 to end on a . winning note in France at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Frankel's long-standing owner, Prince . Khalid Abdullah, was also retaining the race he has sponsored for over . 20 years, and was aked as to whether he would be tempted by the Arc. Winners: Sir Henry would not let cancer stop him from watching Frankel race to victory at York Racecourse yesterday . In good health: Sir Henry at Royal Ascot in 1999 . 'I don't think so,' he said. 'I will talk to Henry about it but we'll see. I will do whatever Henry thinks . 'I didn't think a mile and a quarter was a problem, but more than that I don't think so.' The owner's racing manager, Teddy Grimthorpe, said: 'For Henry and the team to bring Frankel in such great shape to York, in front of a brilliant crowd who appreciated him, is absolutely fantastic. 'Then for the horse to perform like he did, it's a dream, isn't it?' Considering the Arc, Mr Grimthorpe said: 'He's not in there. Henry didn't want him in the race and he'd have to supplemented. 'There . will be a discussion and we'll have to see. The plan was always Ascot . but we'll have to see how he comes out of the race.' Sir Henry has been Champion Trainer 10 times . and, as of June 2012, has trained 25 domestic Classic winners, . comprising four winners of the Epsom Derby, eight winners of the Epsom . Oaks, six winners of the 1,000 Guineas, three of the 2,000 Guineas and . four winners of the St. Leger Stakes. His success in the Epsom Oaks and the 1,000 Guineas has made him particularly renowned for his success with fillies.

The asking price for the meagre piece of real estate in the cramped seaside town of St Ives, Cornwall, is more than twice the county's annual wage. Not much bang for your buck: This parking space is expected to sell for an incredible £55,000 . Estate agent Paul Le Bas described the race for a place to park as a 'dog fight'. Located on Tregenna Hill, it is expected to be bought by a second home owner. Deputy mayor of St Ives, Cllr Colin Nicholls, said: 'There's only a certain type of person that wants to pay all that, but it seems to me like a dinner party accessory. People are buying them to be able to say that because they are awash with money.' Two years ago, another parking space in the town went for £60,000 and one three years before that sold for £24,000. But it still pales in comparison with the $1million parking space that went on the market in New York earlier this year.

He was suspended on full pay for five years then sacked after the Home Office deemed him a risk to national security. Now the officer, a naturalised British citizen, has attacked the Home Office for not allowing him to defend himself against the unspecified allegations and is suing his former employers for discrimination and unfair dismissal.

The Home Office added that even an innocent link to such people would put Mr W in a ‘vulnerable position’. Large parts of the hearing at the .

Mr W joined the Home Office in 1999 – the same year he was granted British citizenship. His last role before his suspension . was as an assistant immigration officer at Gatwick Airport, in which . capacity he could routinely check classified information and . occasionally top-secret data.

Hounded: Nicola Brookes, 45, was abused by anonymous online bullies after she posted a message on Facebook. A police officer has been arrested in connection with the case . A policeman has been arrested over vile abuse posted online to a mother who won a landmark case to have his identity released by Facebook. Nicola Brookes, 45, was hounded by anonymous online bullies after she used the social networking site to write a message of support for an X Factor contestant. But while she was tormented with abusive messages, threatening her with death and accusing her of being a paedophile, she claims police officers initially told her to go home. After taking her case to the High Court, however, Facebook was for the first time forced to disclose the identities of the bullies. Now police have arrested  Lee Rimell, 32, on suspicion of being one of the trolls allegedly behind months of ‘vicious and depraved’ abuse. Rimell is believed to have been based at Stechford Police Station in Birmingham. He has not been suspended. Last night, Miss Brookes, who suffers from Crohn’s disease, described the arrest as a ‘significant breakthrough’ but said she was horrified one of the suspected trolls is a policeman. She added: ‘It’s disgusting. Nothing surprises me anymore. ‘I feel absolutely let down by the system. I’ve had to wait nine months for this arrest. ‘I’m so happy that the authorities are finally doing something about this. My life has been ruined for so long,’ the single mother added. Her ordeal began last November when her daughter Harley told her people were writing nasty comments about X Factor contestant Frankie Cocozza on his Facebook page. Wanting to defend the young singer, she posted: ‘Keep your friends and your family close, Frankie. They’ll move on to someone else soon.’ Online trolls turned on her in minutes, writing that she was a ‘desperate pedo [sic] b****’ and ‘a ****ing dog’. Within 24 hours she had been hounded with more than 100 messages of abuse. One . of the online bullies set up a Facebook profile in Miss Brookes’s name, . using it to send explicit messages to children. It had a picture of her . and her email address, with messages falsely describing her as a drug . dealer, a prostitute and a child abuser. Suspect: Lee Rimell, a serving West Midlands Police officer, has been arrested over the abuse posted online to Miss Brookes . On one occasion, a picture of her was placed on an image of Myra Hindley. She also had her email address hacked and, on Mother’s Day this year, trolls published her Brighton home address. But they didn’t stop there. They also found her daughter Harley’s profile and doctored a picture of her, placing her head on the body of a lap-dancer. After Miss Brookes began legal action, the High Court granted an order in June compelling Facebook to disclose the bullies’ names, email addresses and their computers’ internet protocol (IP) addresses – used to determine a computer’s location. Rimell was arrested last week after checks on Miss Brookes’s computer. He allegedly began the trolling by using a fake account under the name Cuthbert Bollingsworth Smyth. He is also accused of hacking into Miss Brookes’s email account. Days after her High Court victory, Miss Brookes found someone had logged on to her emails and read crucial case evidence. When officers from Sussex Police examined her computer they found the hacker had left a trace behind. Rimell has since been bailed while officers continue their investigations. A police spokesman said: ‘West Midlands Police is assisting Sussex Police in connection with an ongoing inquiry regarding a serving West Midlands police officer.’ Bullied: Miss Brookes's ordeal began when she wrote a message of support for X Factor contestant Frankie Cocozza (left).

Yosemite said that anyone who may be experiencing flu-like symptoms to see a doctor as soon as possible. The Park Service told the LA Times: ""An outreach effort is currently underway by the park concessionaire to contact visitors who stayed in ""Signature Tent Cabins"" at Curry Village from mid-June through the end of August. 'These individuals are being informed of the recent cases and are being advised to seek immediate medical attention if they exhibit any symptoms of hantavirus.' A second person has died within a month from the rare rodent-borne disease hantavirus after visiting one of the most popular parts of Yosemite National Park. Yosemite National Park in the western . Sierra Nevada mountains of California has over Over 3.7 million people visitors every year . The first victim, a 37-year-old Alameda County man, is believed to have contracted the disease while staying in a tent cabin at the park's Curry Village in mid June. Details of the latest victim have not been released. Hantaviruses are spread through rodent bites, urine or saliva. Humans infected can develop potentially fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever  and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Early symptoms are similar to the flu and include chills, fever and muscle aches. Sufferers may may begin to feel better for a short  time, but within 1-2 days, experience breathing difficulties, a dry cough vomiting and headaches. Of the 587 documented U.S. cases since the virus was identified in 1993, about one-third proved fatal. There is no specific treatment for the virus. Almost all cases involving humans have been linked to contact with rodent excrement. Howver human-to-human transmission has been reported with the Andes mountains in South America. The name hantavirus comes from the Hantan River area in South Korea, from where teh first cases were identified in the late 1970s. The disease was formerly known as Korean hemorrhagic fever. During the Korean war Several thousand United Nations soldiers became ill with the disease sparking a 25-year search for the cause. There has been one other confirmed case of the illness, and a fourth possible case is currently being investigated. Federal health authorities say symptoms may . develop up to 5 weeks after exposure to urine, droppings, or saliva of . infected rodents, and visitors have been advised to watch for symptoms . for up to six weeks. Following . the first death, which was reported earlier this month, state health . officials advised anyone with symptoms to seek medical attention and let . doctors know if they were camping in Yosemite. Officials said thousands of people visit the park every month, so it would be impossible to track everyone who had set foot in Curry Village. Curry Village is the most popular and economical lodging area in the park, a picturesque assemblage of rustic cabins at the base of the 3,000-foot promontory Glacier Point. Gediman told the San Francisco Chronicle that of the 408 tent cabins in the village, 91 are of the 'signature' variety where the four cases had stayed, which feature more insulation and amenities than the others. Gediman said contractors are working on the signature cabins to protect park-goers. 'They're doing everything they can to eliminate areas where mice can get into the cabins,' Gediman told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'This was never because the cabins were dirty, it was never because we didn't take care of them. This is just because approximately 20 percent of all deer mice are infected with hantavirus. And they're here in Yosemite Valley.' This year's deaths mark the first such deaths in park visitors, although two others were stricken in a more remote area in 2000 and 2010, officials said.

A vast unexploded Second World War bomb has brought chaos to the biggest airport in Holland  disrupting the journeys of thousands of travellers - including many Britons. Builders digging around Terminal C at Schiphol Amsterdam uncovered the device wedged deep underground. It will lead to questions as to how a major airport used by 45 million people a year could have built over a live bomb. Scroll down for video . Danger: A terminal was closed at Schiphol Airport after workmen discovered the unexploded WWII bomb . Shocking discovery: The potentially lethal device was found during excavation works at the airport . The terminal, from which flights regularly leave for a number of British airports including London City, was immediately closed, with flights cancelled. ‘This has had a big impact,’ said an airport spokesman. ‘Delays and cancellations are inevitable, and many people will be caught up in the problems. A major evacuation has already taken place.’ The spokesman said an army bomb disposal team had arrived at the scene after the discovery of the bomb soon after dawn today. Because of the age of the device, it is likely to be many hours, if not days, before the bomb is declared safe and can be removed. The find comes after thousands of people were evacuated from . their homes in Munich, Germany, as experts tried to defuse a 550lb WWII bomb found beneath . ground at the site of the former Schwabinger 7 nightclub - a hangout of the . Rolling Stones in the 1970s. The awesome power of the explosion gave . an insight into the devastating impact of wartime bombing raids when . thousands of tonnes of explosives were dropped by Allied aircraft. Controlled blast: Could the unexploded bomb found at Schiphol Airport be detonated in a controlled explosion like a similar-sized device was yesterday in Munich, Germany? Menace: Thousands of unexploded WWII bombs (like this one found in Munich, pictured), are thought to be buried across Europe . The spokesman warned passengers to check their flights before departure so as to avoid long waits at the airport. The bomb is thought to have been dropped by the RAF or American Airforce during raids between 1940 and 1944, when Schiphol was used by the German Luftwaffe. There were regular day and night raids on the then military airbase, especially because the Nazi airforce could use it to launch raids on nearby countries including Britain. Allied bombs weighing 550lb were regularly dropped, all containing complicated chemical fuses which could trigger at any time. The RAF and USAAF dropped huge payloads of bombs on Nazi positions all over the Netherlands, as part of the 2.8million tons used to flatten vast areas of German-occupied Europe. This figure compares to the relatively small figure of 75,000 tons of bombs unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain. Even though the war ended 67 years ago, ordnance is still found all over Holland, just as it is in neighbouring countries such as France, and Germany itself. However, it is highly unusual to find a bomb in a heavily populated area like one of the world’s biggest airports. Some 48million people travel through Schiphol every year – ensuring that questions will be asked as to how one of its major terminals was allowed to be built on top of an unexploded bomb. A major enquiry is expected to be launched in to today’s find.","Terminal C closed immediately after discovery of bomb .

These are the pictures of high-flying Deutsche Bank executive Brian Mulligan after he was allegedly beaten by police in Los Angeles. Mulligan, who serves as the managing director and vice chairman of media for the powerful international bank, claims he was brutally attacked by the LAPD, leaving him bruised, bloodied, and with lacerations across his face. The grisly pictures show both before and after he underwent facial surgeries for a nasal fracture, allegedly after the beat-down. Scroll down for video . Bruised and broken: Deutsche Bank's Brian Mulligan, pictured left, before surgery, and right, after surgery to repair various lacerations and a nasal fracture; he alleges he was attacked by the LAPD in May . Mulligan has enlisted the help of high-profile attorney Michael Flanagan, who represented Dr Conrad Murray in the Michael Jackson death trial. Mr Flanagan insists that officers concluded the banking executive was not under the influence of any drugs at the time of the alleged altercation, according to TMZ. They told the celebrity gossip website: ‘Mulligan had committed no violations of law and was not arrested. No drugs were found during a search of his person…and the officers found absolutely no evidence of drug use by Mulligan.’ A representative for the Los Angeles Police told MailOnline that no statement has been released regarding the case. According to an initial police report, Mulligan, 53, appeared 'out of it' after officers responded to 911 calls about a man trying to break into people's cars at a drive-thru in Highland Park. Mulligan seemed to be 'under the influence based on his behavior', Lieutenant Andrew Neiman told MailOnline. Lawsuit: The bank magnate is suiting the LAPD for $50million after the altercation left him with nasal fractures and other injuries . CBS Los Angeles, citing a police report seen exclusively by the station, reported that officers were told by Mulligan he was high on marijuana and had ingested ‘White Lightning,’ another term for bath salts, and had not slept for four days. Altercation: Vice chairman of Deutsche Bank Brian Mulligan got into an alleged altercation with the LAPD this May . The bank executive was spotted wandering in a confused state by passers-by on May 15, 2011 at around 10.40pm. Due to his erratic behavior, officers called a senior officer to the scene, who carried out a drug evaluation. There was no definitive evidence of a controlled substance that the LAPD test for, according to the police spokesman. Mulligan told officers he was 'tired and exhausted' and asked to be escorted to his car so he could collect belongings to go to the local Highland Park Motel. When they reached the vehicle, there was a large amount of money in the car, causing officers to call for back-up as is protocol. Mulligan was then left at the motel by officers without further incident. Later that night at around 1am, the same officers who dropped Mulligan off at the motel responded to reports of a man trying to get into vehicles. They saw Mulligan . in the street, running into oncoming traffic. Officers called him . back on to the sidewalk, but rather than comply, Mulligan assumed a . ‘combative stance’, striking martial arts poses. At that point, officers were forced to subdue Mulligan adding that a ‘use of force then occurred' before he was arrested. The businessman's injuries required him to be admitted to hospital for facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures. Earlier this month Mulligan sued the LAPD for $50million, saying that during the 2011 encounter he was battered by the police. He said, she said: Police officers said they found Mulligan walking near this Los Angeles-area Jack-in-the-Box . Held hostage? Police say that he requested to be taken to the Highland Park Motel to rest, but his lawyer claims he was held hostage there . Mulligan, a graduate of the University of Southern California, has worked at numerous high-profile firms, including Fox, NewsCorp, and Universal Studios. Premiere Magazine voted him as one of the '50 most powerful people in Hollywood' and the Los Angeles Business Journal voted him 'One of the 10 most prominent bankers in Hollywood'. From 2003 to 2008, he served on the board of Napster as the Director, Chairman of Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and Member of Executive Committee. According to documents obtained by the MailOnline, the Deutsche . Bank executive further alleged that the LAPD officers in question were . holding him hostage at the motel where he was staying as a means to . steal the $5,000 he had on his person at the time. Mulligan’s . lawyer Michael Flanagan said in his claim that the officers stopped him . on a sidewalk in Los Angeles and discovered $5,000 cash in his car. 'At that point, he was in such great . fear that he believed the LAPD officers were not truly LAPD officers but . may be impostors bent on robbing or killing.'Attorney Michael Flanagan . At that point, Mr Flanagan said that his client was driven to a hotel and told he would be killed if he attempted to leave. He was also told that he would not be allowed to call his wife Victoria, to let her and their children know where he was. When, after a few hours, Mulligan did try to leave, Mr Flanagan said that police found him and beat him mercilessly. 'At that point, he was in such great fear that he believed the LAPD officer were not truly LAPD officers but may be impostors bent on robbing or killing,' the suit reads. According to TMZ, Mulligan was booked for resisting arrest as well as interfering with law enforcement. The Deutsche executive suffered facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures, which will require extensive reconstructive surgery. Lt Andrew Neiman said the Force Investigation Division has opened an inquiry into Mulligan’s arrest, adding that it will likely be a year before it is completed. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the case, but said that Mulligan has since been to work since the events in May. His attorneys estimate that the incident has caused him the loss of $500,000 already and in the coming years, amount to a loss of $5million.","Deutsche Bank Managing Director of Media Brian Mulligan claims he was assaulted by two LAPD officers who wanted to steal $5,000 cash from him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:50 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:36 EST, 30 August 2012 . Eric McGowen has been sentenced to 99 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child in the first trial stemming from the horrific gang-rape of a Texas 11-year-old -- but the 20-year-old is still missing after brazenly escaping from court yesterday. McGowen hasn't been seen since he . vanished during a break in proceedings on Wednesday afternoon and the Liberty County Sheriff's Office . had no update on his whereabouts today. But Judge Mark Morefield chose to push ahead with the trial without the defendant, calling the remaining witnesses. Jurors deliberated for just 20 minutes before  finding the missing man guilty and after another 30 minutes they had decided his sentence. On trial: Eric McGowen, 20, pictured, is among 14 adults accused of raping the girl in the shocking series of attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland . McGowen was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and faces up to life in prison for his part in the shocking attacks, which saw the girl, now 13, gang-raped by 20 men and boys on multiple occasions in an abandoned trailer. His lawyer didn’t present any evidence or call witnesses. McGowen is one of 14 adults accused . of having sex with the girl. Six boys also are charged in the case. One of the last witnesses to be called was forensic nurse examiner, Ashley Huyah, who interviewed and examined the girl after she suffered a gut-wrenching gang-rape in November 2010. Huynh testified that the girl said she had sex with at least four males, including McGowen. The nurse said knee abrasions were only physical evidence she found when examining the girl. Jennifer Pollock, a DNA expert with Texas Department of Public Safety crime lab in Houston, was the final witness for the prosecution. Pollock said she examined evidence at a scene where the girl was allegedly attacked and could only conclude that McGowen can’t be excluded as a contributor to the DNA that was analysed. Liberty County sheriff's Capt. Steve Greene said courthouse security wasn't required to follow McGowen when he fled the courtroom yesterday because he was out on bail. Greene said the sheriff's office was notified by the court bailiff when the defendant didn't return after the afternoon coffee break. He warned that McGowen should be considered armed and dangerous. Judge Morefield yesterday issued a warrant for McGowen's arrest and hiked the man's bail from $35,000 to $250,000. Missing: McGowen apparently escaped from the Liberty County Courthouse during a break in the trial . Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 . Prosecutors and defense attorneys . huddled briefly with the judge in front of his bench . when the defendant, who was wearing a white shirt, jeans and tennis shoes, vanished after sitting through the bulk of the day's proceedings, including his victim's testimony. McGowen's attorney Matthew Poston and prosecutors did not comment on McGowen's disappearance because of a gag order, though Poston said he thought his client was in the bathroom when he didn't return to his seat. The judge then told jurors the trial would go on without him. Before McGowen's brazen escape, the victim broke down in court as she watched a video of one of the painful attacks. The . girl, who authorities haven't named, testified against McGowen in the . first trial stemming from the series of horrendous attacks that took . place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston. In court yesterday, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. The girl said she was brought into . what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and . others took turns having sex with her. Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly. But she broke down on the witness stand when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks. She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case. Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, police said . She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.' 'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked. 'Yes sir,' the girl said. The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified. She . mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the . floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding. However, she had difficulty remembering names and exactly how all the assaults occurred, according to the Houston Chronicle. She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants . called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that . continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer. Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.' Jurors were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers found inside and outside the house in the November incident. Three people who have pleaded guilty — two adults and a juvenile who has since turned 18 — also testified yesterday. Isaiah Ross, 22, told jurors he saw McGowen sexually assault the girl with a beer bottle. The other adult, Marcus Porchia, 28, and the teen testified they saw others assault the girl but not McGowen. McGowen’s attorney, Matthew Poston, questioned the girl for about six minutes, during which time he asked whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never had sex with McGowen. Accused: Kelvin Rashad King, left, and Devo Shaun Green, right, were among those accused of raping the girl . Gang-rape: Xavier King, left, and Marcus Anthony Porchia, right, are among the 20 men and boys in the case . The girl said she didn’t remember saying that. During . opening statements on Wednesday, Warren told jurors he would present . them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted . to raping the girl. 'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said. The prosecutor added that while the . girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, . these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things . against her best interests,' according to the Chronicle. Authorities say the then 11-year-old was . assaulted at least five times between mid-September and early December . 2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student . to a 28-year-old. The attackers filmed the girl being raped and took cellphone photos. On Tuesday, . a videotaped police interview in which McGowen admitted he and eight . other men took turns having sex with the girl, sometimes two at a time, . was shown in court, although jurors were not present. Alleged attacker: Jared Glenn McPherson, pictured, is one of the men accused of raping the 11-year-old . In the video, which McGowen's lawyers . argued should not be allowed as evidence, the 20-year-old initially . denied ever touching the girl, but he later broke down and told . investigators he engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Houston . Chronicle. He also said one of the others penetrated the girl with a beer bottle. On Tuesday, Poston tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out, arguing that police improperly questioned McGowen. During his opening statement, Poston told jurors that the video evidence in the case doesn’t show McGowen having sex with the girl. 'The truth in this case is not always what it seems,' he said. He also said to jurors, regarding the video 'what you'll see will not be pleasant but the most unsettling parts do not contain McGowen having intercourse with this girl.' Yesterday, Poston questioned how the girl learned McGowen's name since she was only aware of his street nickname 'Clyde.' She told him she believed the first time she heard that name was from school police who were questioning her about the rapes, the Chronicle reported. Two men and all six juveniles have pleaded guilty in the horrific case. A gag order has prevented prosecutors . and defense attorneys from commenting about the case. McGowen's . trial, which is being held in the nearby county of Liberty, is expected . to yield further details about the attacks in coming days. The investigation into the shocking gang-rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11-year-old being raped in an abandoned trailer. Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records. The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents. Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticised those suggestions. It has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic. Two other adults have previously pleaded guilty, with one receiving a 15-year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing. Six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty. They received 7-year prison terms, but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time. Most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child.","Eric McGowen, 20, sentenced to 99 years' prison after being convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child .

The pressure heaped on students of Harvard College to become the next Mark Zuckerberg has caused a 'culture of cheating' to emerge claims one former graduate. Eric Kester, the author of 'That Book About Harvard: Surviving the World's Most Famous University, One Embarrassment at a Time', has said that allegations 125 students cheated on a final exam at the venerable institution do not surprise him. Reflecting on his own time at Harvard where he was exposed to cheating rings, Kester remarked that, 'I'm slightly sympathetic to the students, because in our society and especially at Harvard, there are high expectations to become the next Mark Zuckerberg.' Harvard University''s main campus: The college has become embroiled in a cheating scandal that has seen 125 students put under investigation . This follows the news yesterday that officials at the Cambridge, Massachusetts university had discovered at least 125 students who they think joined forces to cheat on a take-home final exam during the spring semester this year. Eric Kester, who graduated from Harvard in 2008 outlines a culture of pressure at Harvard College which pushes some students to cheat in his book 'That Book About Harvard' The college is currently conducting an investigation into 250 final exams from the 'Introduction to Congress' class that is taught by Professor Matthew B. Platt after noticing similarities initially in 20 exams and after a review, 125. 'We take academic integrity very seriously because it goes to the heart of our educational mission,' said Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in a statement. 'Academic dishonesty cannot and will not be tolerated at Harvard.' However, for Kester, the pressure at . Harvard can cause students to go to extremes to make sure that they . leave the school with a degree. 'When I was a student there, I definitely noticed there was a culture of cheating there,' said Kester to ABC News today. 'There's . a lot of pressure internally and externally to succeed at Harvard and . when kids who are not used to failing feel these things, it can really . bend their ethics in ways I didn't expect to see.' The author, who graduated in 2008, . says that he struggled to complete a calculus class when he was there . and because of that was approached by a group of students who planned to . cheat. They offered him the chance to, but after wrestling with his morals, Kester decided not to. 'It . comes down to the responsibility of the students, they're adults, they . know cheating is wrong, that's the bottom line,' said Kester. In his memoir, Eric Kester writes that his classmates frequently copied each other's . math and science work and shared exam answers in campus . bathrooms . Author Eric Kester has revealed in his memoir 'That Book About Harvard' a culture of cheating that is rife and rampant across the board at the world famous institution . Dozens of Harvard University students are being investigated for cheating after school officials discovered evidence they may have wrongly shared answers or plagiarized on a final exam . Noting the irony that many students are intelligent enough to complete a Harvard course without resorting to skullduggery, Kester said that the pressure is key. 'Most people who cheat at Harvard don't really need to, it's just sort of a way of making themselves feel safer of not failing,' said Kester. 'The fact that this story alone has become national story is evidence that Harvard is this lightning rod. Kids now are very aware, they've seen 'The Social Network' 'Most of these kids have spent at least high school and maybe since they were 5 or 6 years old getting into this school, doing SAT tutoring since 10 years old and going to organic chemistry summer camp. When you take that into account, you get a clearer sense of why you might be afraid.' Jesse Eisenberg, left, and Joseph Mazzello in Columbia Pictures' 'The Social Network.': Eric Kester feels the success of the movie has caused a new generation of undergraduates of Harvard to feel the need to be the next Mark Zuckerberg . This comes as Harvard said they will consider instituting an honor code as it investigates whether at least 125 undergraduates cheated by working together on a take-home exam in the spring. Officials said they intend to start broad conversations about academic honesty, including why it is vital to intellectual inquiry, in the wake of what is believed to be the largest such episode in recent school history. 'We really think we need to work harder,' said Jay M. Harris, dean of undergraduate education. 'We do think it's an opportunity to really put out before the community how much we value integrity.' School officials said Thursday they discovered roughly half of the students in a class of at least 250 people may have shared answers or plagiarized on a final. They declined to release the name of the class or the students' names. 'These allegations, if proven, represent totally unacceptable behavior that betrays the trust upon which intellectual inquiry at Harvard depends,' President Drew Faust said.","Eric Kester graduated in 2008 from Harvard and has published a memoir of his time at the college called 'That Book About Harvard'

A man whose teen step-daughter was allegedly shot dead by three soldiers to protect an anti-government militia group rushed and yelled at one of the suspects as he appeared in court on Thursday. Private Isaac Aguigui, Private Christopher Salmon and Sergeant Anthony Peden - all active-duty soldiers stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia - appeared separately in court as the District Attorney said he will seek the death penalty for each suspect. Wesley Thomas, whose 17-year-old daughter Tiffany York was killed alongside her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, last year, bolted from his seat in the courtroom and rushed one of the suspects, Peden. 'You killed my kid!' he screamed before officers wrestled him to the floor, handcuffed him and led away, alongside Roark's father, Brett, who called one of the soldiers, 'Piece of (expletive).' Anger: Wesley Thomas, whose stepdaughter was shot dead by three soldiers last December, is tackled by courtroom security during the hearing of one of her murderers . Swipe: Thomas was wrestled to the ground and led out of court - but was not charged for the outburst . Both men were led out of the courtroom, but neither was charged for the outburst. Thomas, Salmon and Peden are each charged with 13 counts including malice murder, felony murder and illegal gang activity in the December 4 slayings. The victims were shot in the head in the woods of rural Long County near Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia. Fishermen found their bodies the day after they were killed. 'I want them gone. I want all of these individuals to disappear,' said Nicholas Lee York, Tiffany's brother, who applauded the decision to seek death for the soldiers. 'They took something irreplaceable from me.' Hate: As he tried to reach the defendant, Thomas yelled: 'You (expletive) killed my kid!' Victims: Tiffany York, 17, and her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, were shot dead by three soldiers who wanted to protect their anti-government militia and their plans to assassinate the president . The case took a stunning turn at an . earlier hearing Monday when prosecutors told a Superior Court judge the . accused soldiers belonged to an anti-government militia operating within . the U.S. military that had stockpiled at least $87,000 worth of guns . and bomb components. They . said the group had a range of plans - from bombing a park fountain in . nearby Savannah to poisoning apple crops in the state of Washington - . and its ultimate goal was to overthrow the U.S. government and . assassinate the president. President Barack Obama was not mentioned by name as their target. Atlantic . Judicial Circuit District Attorney Tom Durden cites domestic terrorism . as an aggravating factor that warrants the death penalty.

'Sometimes some of these things don't . fit neatly into our state laws,' Durden said after court when asked . about the absence of terrorism-related charges.

They won't be . arraigned or asked to enter pleas until that happens. 'At . this point, there has been no evidence presented to prove anything,' said Keith Higgins, an attorney who represented Aguigui in court . Thursday. 'The fact that certain statements are being made does not . necessarily mean these allegations are true.' Salmon's . wife, Heather Salmon, has also been charged with murder and other . counts. She did not appear in court Thursday and Durden said he will not . seek the death penalty for her. Target: The ruckus took place as Sgt. Anthony Peden appeared at Long County Superior Court . Accused: Isaac Aguigui has also been accused of murder to cover up plans to bring down the government . In court: Christopher Salmon walks into court. The District Attorney said he will seek the death penalty for all three . Authorities . took extra precautions Thursday as the accused soldiers, in shackles . and jailhouse jumpsuits, were brought before the judge for a preliminary . hearing. The defendants were brought to the courthouse one-at-a-time, with their hearings scheduled an hour apart. Deputies armed with assault rifles walked in front of and behind them. Relatives of both victims have been seething since Monday's hearing after a fourth soldier who says he witnessed both slayings testified about them in detail before pleading guilty to reduced charges. Pfc. Michael Burnett told the judge Roark, whom prosecutors say was helping the militia buy guns, had just left the Army and was considered 'a loose end' by Aguigui, the militia's leader. Burnett said Roark and his girlfriend were led to the woods. Peden shot York before she could get out of her car, Burnett testified, then paused to check her pulse and shot her again. Struggle: Wesley Thomas comforts his wife Brenda Thomas during the hearing of Pvt. Isaac Aguigui . Roark was forced to kneel on the ground before Salmon shot him twice in the head, Burnett said. The Army brought its own murder charges in the case in March, but dropped them earlier this month. Civilian federal prosecutors won't say if they're building a case. Durden, the state prosecutor, says he doesn't know how many other members belonged to the militia, which prosecutors say was called F.E.A.R. - Forever Enduring Always Ready. Army authorities have indicated they don't believe the suspects were part of a large group.

The ship, Delhi Express, suffered an engine failure between Somalia and Yemen, an area where pirates are known to operate, and put out a call for help. HMS Pembroke and sister ship HMS Middleton readied their weapons and guarded the vessel until it got moving again. HMS Middleton, which rotated its 40-strong crew every six or eight months, operated out of Bahrain conducting counter-piracy and security patrols as well as exercises with coalition forces.

But in Eastern Russia it brought 'manna from heaven' with an unprecedented tidal wave of molluscs and crabs thrown up on the most popular beach in Vladivostok. Locals said it was useless to throw them back in the sea - they just came ashore again. Fishy feast: Russians flocked to the beaches of Lazurnaya Bay to scoop up the molluscs washed ashore by Typhoon Bolaven . 'Manna from heaven': The beach was covered with a carpet of mussels, clams and crabs . 'Now we know what 'manna from heaven' means,' wrote a local girl Svetlana in her blog. 'People . had nothing else to do but to collect them to cook for a free lunch - . or take nice pictures with beautiful big crabs,' said the Siberian . Times. But as Russians . swarmed onto the beaches of Lazurnaya Bay on the country's Pacific coast . to collect the teeming molluscs, the nearby Korean peninsula was . counting the cost of the typhoon. It submerged houses and roads, . ruining thousands of acres of crops and triggering landslides that . buried train tracks, and was quickly followed by a second major storm, . Typhoon Tembin.

All you can eat: The sands of the Russian beach are invisible beneath the layer of molluscs, as locals gather up the shells . The light-hearted scenes captured on the shores of Siberia were in stark contrast to the havoc wreaked by Typhoon Bolaven and later Typhoon Tembin in North and South Korea.

There were fears for the spread of disease in the Communist state. Deadly storm: A boat is pictured in rough seas off Wonsan City as North Korea is battered by Typhoon Bolaven .

Partying: Some of the girls partying on the bus with Daniel Fernandez posted this picture on Instagram shortly before Fernandez was killed . Horror: Daniel Fernandez, pictured, died on Friday evening after sticking his head out of a double-decker bus which went through an underpass . 'I can’t believe that you’re gone,' Alyssa Argento, a schoolfriend from St Francis Prep, wrote on a Facebook memorial page set up for Fernandez. 'Just 5 minutes before this nightmare happened you were in the back of the bus dancing with me and all of your friends, having so much fun.' The tragedy happened as dozens of teenagers were en-route to a Sweet 16 birthday party in Garfield New Jersey. Some of the teenagers’ Twitter . accounts tell how the group of 65, many of whom were from a Queens . Catholic School, were getting ready for a night of partying. The tweets show how the friends planned on getting ‘sauced’ at the Sweet 16 party, reported the New York Post.

A photo of ecstatic girls, dressed up in . matching turquoise dresses, partying on the bus was posted to Instagram . shortly before the tragedy. A security guard on the double decker bus had repeatedly warned the excited teenagers not to open the hatch. But Fernandez apparently didn’t listen . to the warning, and stuck his head out of the bus’ hatch. When the bus . went under the George Washington bridge overpass, he fatally hit his . head. Immediately after the tragic accident, . terrified friends on the bus took to Twitter again posting about their . panic and praying for Fernandez’s recovery. One friend, Vicky, tweeted later that . night: ‘Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a . bad dream.

Scene: The accident happened on I-95 southbound, near the George Washington Bridge . Security guard Alex Franco told the New York Post that the teens were dancing on the first floor, and the bus was getting hot. He said he went to tell the bus driver about the heat, adding that he was gone for only a few minutes.But . then he heard teenagers screaming, and he saw Mr Fernandez on the floor . of the bus. ‘There was so much blood everywhere,’ he told the New York . Post. He was a beloved student, said Lynch, who taught him last school year. 'He was an adorable, low-key kid, . with a sweet smile,' St Francis teacher Jane Lynch told the Associated . Press. 'Kids loved him; he had lots of friends and was popular with the . girls.' She said a group of students had a . special last project, producing and appearing in a takeoff on the novel . Lord of the Flies, about a group of boys on a desert island who try to . govern themselves, with disastrous results. 'He was very hands-on, he took the leadership role,' said Elizabeth Gonzalez, a student teacher at St. Francis last year. Impact: The roof hatch was found bent back from the impact . Party bus: The double-decker bus was carrying 65 other teenagers to a birthday party in New Jersey . Fernandez played the villain in the . video students posted on YouTube, she said. In class, 'he was very . lively, and high-spirited,' she said. 'And he had so much potential in . his writing.' The school said on its website that . it shared in grief and shock over his death. A wake was set for Monday . in Rego Park, the site said. Designer Limousines, which operates . the bus, expressed its 'deepest heartfelt sympathy' to the teen's . family. The company said it would conduct an internal investigation. According to the New York Times, Mr Fernandez was on his way to a birthday party in New Jersey and was coming from St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens. As the bus drove through the Fletcher Avenue Underpass around 6.30pm, he struck his head on the concrete structure. Remembering: Friends and classmates were quick to create a Facebook group in his memory, posting pictures of Fernandez . Class clown: Teachers and classmates said Fernandez was a promising writer with a great sense of humour . The teenager was hurried to Hackensack University Medical Center, but was pronounced dead on arrival, according to Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman. Twitter user Kaylan Baez was apparently on the double-decker bus, and wrote early Saturday morning: ‘Never thought I would ever witness something like that. My prayers go out to dan and his family. R.I.P. Daniel Fernandez.’ Earlier in the evening, she was tweeting about how excited she was for the party. Another girl who was on the bus tweeted: 'Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a bad . dream. I love you so much Dan you were there for me till the last second.' Shock: One girl apparently witnessed Mr Fernandez's death and tweeted her disbelief . According to the New Milford, New Jersey Patch, many of the 65 teenagers on the double-decker bus ran onto the highway following the accident. Another bus was stopped, and the remaining teenagers were shuttled to the Fort Lee Port Authority station. No other teenagers on the bus were injured. The bus’ hatch was bent back from the impact. According to the Cliffview Pilot, there is supposed to be a safety seal on the hatch. The bus involved in the accident has two floors with a dance floor on the lower level, as well as touch-operated juice machines, satellite TV and WiFi, as well as a V.I.P. room and two sound systems. It is advertised as being able to fit 70 passengers. The traumatic turn of events led to hours of traffic congestion along the southbound area of the George Washington Bridge as investigators tried to piece together what happened. And though no other teens on the bus were injured, sources told ABC 7 that many of them suffered severe emotional trauma from witnessing their friend’s death. Candle in the wind: Mourners lit dozens of candles for the teen at his wake on Saturday evening . Many students reported that they woke up crying or suffered panic attacks last night. A vigil was held at St Francis Prep on Saturday night. Though many of Mr Fernandez’s friends were unable to attend the wake at the Queens high school on Saturday night, the teenager’s friends were quick to post photos of them lighting candles in his memory. One student wrote: ‘I couldn’t be at Prep tonight, but I do have a candle burning at home for you, Dan. Rest in peace!’ Another wrote: ‘Look out for us Dan and Rest In Peace.

A female television anchor made the news herself when she appeared on Egyptian television wearing a headscarf, believed to be a first for the country’s state media. Fatima Nabil read a mid-day news bulletin broadcast on Sunday wearing a cream-coloured hijab. The Cairo broadcast was made possible after the new Egyptian regime abolished a ban on female presenters covering their hair. Scroll down for video . Covered: Fatma Nabil reads out the headlines wearing a headscarf after the conservative Muslim Brotherhood regime lifted a ban on female presenters wearing veils on state television . During the government of Hosni Mubarak, women were not allowed to cover their hair on television however this ban was scrapped by the new Muslim Brotherhood regime led by conservative president Mohamed Morsi. Nabil tweeted: ‘At last, the revolution has reached Maspero [an Egyptian TV building]. This decision is not a grant, but a legal right.’ The new rules for state TV were one of the first actions by the new Information Minister Salah Abdel-Maksoud. It is estimated that 70 per cent of the female population in Egypt wears a veil, however under President Mubarak female state television employees were banned from appearing on camera wearing a hijab. Bare headed: A female presenter on state-owned Nile TV appears without a veil . Some sued against the policy and won, but Mubarak’s Ministry of Information would ignore the rulings. Privately-owned networks have long . employed veiled presenters and many famous actresses have taken the veil . and continued to appear in soap operas aired on the state television network. Members of the Egyptian union of journalists are worried Mohamed Morsi's Islamic government will take control of state media . Nabil worked for . the the Muslim Brotherhood TV network Misr 25 after she was barred from . appearing on state television because of her choice to wear a veil. With . Morsi's election and the appointment of Salah Abdel-Maksoud, who is a . member of the Muslim Brotherhood, she said she was given ‘the green . light’ to come back to state TV. ‘Standards . have nothing to do with the veil, which is a personal choice, but are . all about professional skills and intellect,’ she said. ‘The . revolution [against Mubarak] erupted to set things right. Barring hijab . wearers from appearing on state television was against the law, . constitution and democracy.’ However . critics of the new rule has said that the appearance of veiled women on . state television is merely a result the power shifting from a secular . government to an Islamic one and has nothing to do with freedom. State employees, they say, will still take their cues from the ruling elite, which has now switched to one with more conservative Islamic ideas. Members of Egypt's . union of journalists have accused the Muslim Brotherhood of trying to make the . press its mouthpiece after 50 new editors of state-owned media were appointed by the . Islamist-dominated upper house of parliament, the Shurah Council. A majority of those appointed were either . Islamists or sympathisers. Mohamed Morsi, who resigned from the . Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party upon his election in . June, and his former party comrades have allegedly tried to silence . media organisations who attempt to criticise the Muslim Brotherhood. New horizons: The abolition of the ban may lead to entire broadcasting teams wearing hijab or niqab, like this private satellite one, on state television . Last month formal accusations by state prosecutors were filed against two journalists, while an issue of the newspaper al-Dostour was confiscated by the state's censorship unit - disappointing those who believed last year's overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak would lead to greater media freedom. In several incidents, journalists say, the newly appointed editors-in-chief have censored anti-Islamist columnists.

But for now, black bears across the western United States have taken to scavenging for food to fatten up before the winter, and for many across Colorado, it has become a record problem - and is getting worse. In August alone, police in Aspen received nearly 300 calls to report the lumbering creatures, up a staggering 668 per cent from last year. Scroll down for video . Chow time: Black bears have infiltrated city blocks and backyards alike in a desperate search for food before winter . Night on the town: This bear was spotted in August trotting around Vail, Colorado . The Aspen Times reported late last month that bear activity has been up significantly this year compared with years past. Aspen Police Department bear specialist Dan Glidden told the Times that the influx in bears is in part due to this year’s severe drought conditions. He said that bears have been forced into urban and suburban areas this year because food supplies are short elsewhere. A dumpster or trash can becomes a meal for the creatures. Aspen Public Radio’s Marci Krivonen noted similar conditions. She reported: ‘The drought has dried up many of the chokecherry and acorn crops that normally grow abundantly, so the bears must search for their dinner.’ Another problem is that the human population has bled into the bear’s natural habitat, meaning they must search greater distances for food sources. ABC News predicted today that the bear epidemic out West will worsen as the summer ends and fall commences, as bears must consume highly-caloric meals in preparation for winter. Branching out: A family of black bears was spotted hanging out in a tree near Denver . Dry season: There has been severe drought in much of the country this summer, meaning that the bears' food supplies are dwindling . ‘They’re looking at trying to consume 20,000 calories a day,’ Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department’s Randy Hampton told ABC News. Last week, a Montana rancher shot and killed a black bear that scaled a tall fence and broke into his house to rummage for food this week along the Rocky Mountain Front. Lane Yeager discovered damage when he returned to his home near Choteau on Monday evening. The young male bear had broken through a screen and entered an open window, wrecked a lazy Susan and tore off a door to get to food in the trash and in the pantry. 'It was dark out. I was headed for the light switch when it ran across ahead of me,' Yeager told the Great Falls Tribune. 'That's when I knew I had an issue.' Damage control: Police in Aspen received nearly 300 calls reporting bears in August alone; here, a black bear left quite a mess . Mike Madel, grizzly bear management specialist with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said the bear had probably been in the house for an hour. Yeager dispatched it with a rifle. 'I killed it so someone else wouldn't have to,' Yeager said. 'We're fat with grizzlies, but the black bear was off the beaten path.' Indeed, bears will go to any lengths necessary to get the calories they’re craving. In Colorado last week, a hungry black bear broke into a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store in Estes Park, Colorado to find his favourite treats. Mr Glidden said that the black bear epidemic can be lessened slightly by safe practices. For one, waste should be placed in bear-proof containers. Those who don’t comply with city mandates will be subject to heavy fining. Bears that are recovered from populated areas have a two-strike policy, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Mike Porras said. After the first offence, the bear is tagged and relocated. After the second strike, they are euthanized. Already, at least 28 bears have been put down.

And it seems that readers really are taking inspiration from the best-selling British book with couples now having three times as much sex thanks to the sizzling page-turner. Researchers found on average women slept with their partners just once a week before reading the book, but this leapt to three times every week once they finished the erotic read. Couples are now enjoying more sex each week and are incorporating new positions into their sex lives thanks to Fifty Shades of Grey . One in eight women now bed their other half every day, up from just three per cent this time last year, the study for Netmums.com found. And the nation’s sex sessions are lasting longer too - with men enjoying on average an extra 26 hours of sex a year. Two-thirds of women said reading the book made their lovemaking last longer, with the average session now taking 15 minutes more. With one in 25 couples enjoying romps an extra hour long. The best-selling erotic novel has boosted sales of sex toys and Ann Summers have even launched 'Fifty Shades of Grey' sex parties . Couples have also been inspired to use extra sex positions after reading the sexually adventurous book. Previously one in eight used just one position each time they made love and now over 40 per cent of couples cram in five or more positions each time they have sex. The UK’s favourite sex position is now the ‘Reverse Cowgirl’, replacing the tamer ‘Doggy Style’ which couples favoured before finishing the steamy read. Overall 64 per cent of women said the sizzling page-turner had made them more sexually adventurous, while 54 per cent said the boost to their love life had made them emotionally closer to their partner too. The raunchy read also sparked a baby boom with one in 33 women who read it ending up pregnant and a further nine per cent using the book to tempt their man into more sex in a bid to fall pregnant. A third of girls fell pregnant in the very first month they started reading the book, with a further 42 per cent pregnant the month after. Of the 2,183 women polled by Netmums, nearly half (49 per cent) said their partner was delighted they read the book as it spiced up their sex life and eight per cent of men have actually read it. But one in nine (11 per cent) had been banned from reading the book by their partners, with three per cent claiming their men said it was ‘disgusting’. Two in five women also bought sex toys or visited a sex shop after reading the book. The most popular purchases were blindfolds, handcuffs and vibrators with half trying these - while an adventurous one in five snapped up bondage ties, sex balls, whips and paddles. Half found out about the read from friends while one in 20 were told by other mums at the school gate - and seven per cent heard about it from their own mother. The erotic book recently overtook the Highway Code to be the bestselling British book of all time. Brits have bought over five million copies of the tome that traces the relationship between naive college graduate Anastasia Steele and possessive billionaire Christian Grey. Dubbed ‘Mummy Porn’ the book has been . so successful London-based author E L James is thought to make over a . million a week from sales. Netmums . founder Siobhan Freegard said: 'It’s not called Mummy Porn for nothing. The book has set Britain’s sex lives on fire with even worn-out mums . finding much more time to make love. It is thought that author EL James is netting £1mil each week for the best-selling novel which many credit for invigorating their sex lives . 'It’s a phenomenon which has put a smile on millions of women’s faces - and the twinkle back in their partner’s eyes. 'But it’s also interesting to see how reading the book and spicing up your sex life can make you emotionally closer to your partner. Here’s hoping the 50 Shades effect will see couples grow stronger together and well as having more fun in the sack.' An Ann Summers spokeswoman said: 'We could not agree more with these stats - enquiries in-store and at parties have increased 10-fold and we are inundated with demands for themed 50 Shades of Grey parties. 'We are struggling to keep up with demand. Jiggle balls come in and they fly out again. This has helped women feel more sexy and confident in the bedroom and the nation is loving it!'","UK’s favourite sex position now ‘Reverse Cowgirl’, replacing ‘Doggy Style’

Some may dream of country mansions and huge yachts, but for the average Briton the cost of luxury is somewhat cheaper. Most believe they could afford a life of luxury on £4,413 a month after tax and national insurance are deducted, a study found. Although this would require an annual salary of more than £80,000 – which is more than three times the national average of £26,100 – it is a long way short of a tycoon’s earnings. Just right: Most people think £1,922.75 a month is the amount needed for a comfortable lifestyle (file picture) The poll of 2,000 people also revealed that most think they need a take-home income of £1,722 a month – £26,500 a year before tax and NI are deducted – to survive. They believe they could live comfortably on £1,922 a month – around £30,000 a year. The study found that millions rank money more highly than friendship or their families. Three out of ten said money was more important to them than their friends, while 28 per cent named it as more of a priority to them than spending time with their family. More than one in four Britons considered it to be more important than job security, while 29 per cent think it is more significant than how happy they are in their career. For a quarter of those polled, socialising with friends is the first thing to be sacrificed when money is tight. Another one in ten save money by going out less with their partner while one in 20 spend less on their families. 'Extras': Gym memberships, charitable donations and new clothes were some of the first things to fall by the wayside for those on a budget (file picture) Luxuries such as clothes and good food are the most common items to go when on a budget, while gym memberships and charitable donations also get the chop. The research, commissioned by Skrill, an e-commerce business that facilitates online payments, found that more than one in five think cash will disappear over the next 20 years, with the internet and mobile phones being used for purchases instead. Already, 30 per cent of people use their debit or credit cards to pay for every transaction, however small. The survey follows David Cameron’s much-ridiculed £2million state research project into the nation’s ‘emotional’ wellbeing. Last month it found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that those who have more money are generally a lot happier with their lives. But there is a ‘squeezed middle’ who appear slightly less happy than those lower down or higher up in the earnings table.","Most thought £1,922.75 a month after tax was the optimum amount for a comfortable lifestyle .

Becky Bellworthy, left, pictured at the summit of Everest which she described as 'overwhelming' Back home in Romsey, Hampshire, Miss Bellworthy, now 20, said: 'Reaching the summit was overwhelming.

'On the day of the stroke, I’d felt well during the day but it had been a long hike and we’d been carrying a heavy load to camp.

'We were just 9,000 feet from the summit and I was looking forward to the final push. I went to bed that night exhausted.

On the way down she faced sheer drops and was required to use unstable ladders to cross plunging crevasses. Paralysed: Becky is pictured waiting for the helicopter to rescue her following her stroke just 9,000 feet from the top last year. She couldn't feel the left side of her body and her left side is still weaker than her right . She said: 'As we crossed the ladders I . couldn’t place my legs too well, and I couldn’t grip supporting ropes . with my left hand. Beneath me were 40-metre drops into darkness. I . couldn’t hold on properly, which was frightening.' She . was flown to the nearest hospital in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, . where doctors scanned her body before declaring her fit to fly home a . week later. Back in the UK doctors prescribed medication to thin her blood. Initially . she was told she had suffered a cerebral oedema - a swelling of the . brain commonly seen in climbers at extreme altitudes. Becky was too high to be . airlifted and had to be carried 4,000 feet down the mountain by a sherpa . after being left paralysed by the stroke. She is pictured being stretchered on to a helicopter which flew her to hospital . 'My symptoms didn’t fit. I wanted to . believe I had suffered a simple migraine and that I could go back to the . mountain straight away, but I learned that wasn’t going to happen.' Eventually . Dr Charles Clark, a top neurologist, confirmed that Becky had suffered a . vasospasmic event in her brain. Blood vessels had spasmed, restricting . circulation which led to paralysis. 'I had suffered a transient ischaemic attack - a mini-stroke. Had I stayed at altitude, I would have died. Recovery: After the stroke she rested for several months and before trying again, determined to fulfill her ambitions . 'An . MRI scan showed there hadn’t been any permanent damage, but I was . warned that if I went back up I could suffer a major attack which would . leave me in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.' Miss . Bellworthy was ordered to rest for several months. She tried swimming . to regain strength in the left side of her body, which despite the . hopeful prognosis, is still partially paralysed today. 'I . went for a lot of testing and I still have a significantly weaker left . side. It’s probably as strong now as it’s ever going to get. But it’s . annoying rather than debilitating.' She . had dreamed of scaling Everest since she saw the peak for the first . time during a Duke of Edinburgh Award expedition to Nepal when she was . 17. Shortly before her . ill-fated first attempt at climbing Everest last May, she had entered . the record books as the youngest female climber ever to scale Baruntse, a . deadly peak in the shadow of the world’s tallest mountain. She was determined to fulfill her . ambitions to scale Everest and, unknown to doctors and her parents, she . arranged the return trip almost immediately after flying back to the UK. 'To . have a stroke at my age is very rare. Doctors warned me that if I tried . to climb the mountain again it could result in permanent paralysis, or . worse. But their advice wasn’t going to stop me.' Her . family, including terrified mother Anne, 59, father Eric, 55, and . sister Jess, 19, begged her not to make a second attempt, but she was . determined. In April, Becky began her second attempt, aided by a doctor travelling as part of the expedition. 'I was jumping at every little ache and pain, and you get plenty of those on the way up. I knew if it happened again, even if I survived, I would never be able to climb again.' On May 19th this year, aged 20, she became the youngest British female climber ever to reach the summit of Everest - a record broken by friend Leanna Shuttleworth, 19, just 24 hours later. Sisters: Becky Bellworthy, left, at home with sister Jess. She said as she started to reach the summit she started hallucinating and she imagined there was a party waiting for her with music and people dancing . 'Hypoxia caused me to hallucinate and I imagined there was a party waiting for me at the summit, with music and people dancing. We stayed at the top for ten minutes before starting the descent. 'I didn’t want to believe doctors who had told me not to go back, but I couldn’t put their warnings out of my mind. It was amazing that I’d got there. 'Many doubted me, which was understandable. It was a crazy thing to do. But I showed them. I did it, and it’s an amazing feeling.' Now Miss Bellworthy is putting her mountain climbing career on hold to concentrate on her medical training at the University of Southampton, where she is entering her second year. 'I had made sacrifices to conquer Everest. I missed exams, and I am still working to catch up. But I don’t see that I made a mistake by returning to the mountain. 'In the long term, my medical practice will be more informed by my experiences. I have come to realise there is a lot of strength in everybody. Until you are in a position where your body is dying, you don’t know the strength you have. 'When you’re on the very extremity of life, you can be surprised at how much fight is left in you. You can overcome anything.'","Becky Bellworthy had to be carried 4,000 feet down the mountain by a sherpa after being left paralysed just 9,000 feet from the summit .

A top leader of the Basque separatist group ETA has been arrested in an anti-terror operation in France. Izaskun Lesaka, 37, who is said to be responsible for the terrorist group’s arms and explosives caches and another suspected ETA member, Joseba Iturbide Ochoteco, 35, were arrested in the early hours of Sundday by elite French police in a hotel in Macon, France, Spain’s Interior Ministry said in a statement. The suspects, both armed, were tracked down and arrested by a special operations tactical unit of the French National Police in close collaboration with Spanish counterparts. Terrorist arrested: Considered one of the top three leaders of Basque separatist group ETA, Izaskun Lesaka (centre) was arrested by elite French police on Sunday . ETA is considered a terrorist organisation by Spain, America and the European Union. It is blamed for the killings of more than 825 people in a campaign of bombings and shootings for an independent Basque state straddling Spain's border with France. It is believed that Lesaka was considered one of ETA's top three leaders and that police also seized ‘abundant computer equipment and a stolen car with false number plates’. Group numbers have been decimated by waves of arrests in Spain, France and other countries over recent years which have further weakened the declining grassroots support among Basque nationalists who had tolerated its activities in exchange for working toward the goal of independence. Armed suspects: Joseba Iturbide Ochoteco, a suspected member of the terrorist group, was also arrested in the early morning raid on a hotel in France . Campaign of killings: Police also seized computer equipment and a stolen car with false number plates during the raid on the suspected terrorists from the group blamed for killing more than 825 people in bombings and shootings for an independent Basque state . ETA did announce a definitive ceasefire late last year but the Spanish Government insists the group must lay down its arms and dissolve before they take such declarations seriously. The group also declared what it called a permanent ceasefire in 2006 but after negotiations with the government failed the ETA detonated a car bomb at Madrid's airport later that year, killing two people. The ministry said Lesaka was one of three hooded ETA members present at the announcement of the October 2011 ceasefire, while Iturbide was linked to the commando unit that set off the airport car bomb. Terrorist links: Lesaka (right) is responsible for the group's arms and explosives cache and Iturbide (left) was linked to the commando unit that set off a car bomb at Madrid's airport .

The arrest comes after alleged Basque terrorist Kemen Uranga, 43, was arrested in London after 12 years on the run in August this year. A suspected Basque terrorist who was on the run for 12 years has been arrested in Britain. He was detained on an international arrest warrant and is wanted for the murder of a Spanish judge. Uranga, an alleged member of an ETA command unit in the Basque province of Vizcaya, is believed to have shot dead Spanish judge Jose Lidon at his home in November 2001 with an accomplice. He was already on the run from security forces a year before allegedly committing the crime.

Guilty: Bursar Sandra stole more than £200,000 from her school to fund her lifestyle including her mother's care home bill . A school bursar who splashed out on a new Mercedes Benz and other luxuries after siphoning off hundreds of thousands of pounds has been jailed for three years. Sandra Ross pleaded guilty to 23 counts of fraud by abuse of position after a police investigation at Temple Mill Primary School in Strood, Kent. The 64-year-old grandmother, from Meopham, Kent, was arrested in March 2011 following the discovery of unauthorised payments totalling £212,166 from the school’s account. She immediately confessed to using the school account to fund her mother’s care home bills and paid back £41,656.27 to the school. But further investigations revealed Ross had also used school funds to pay the deposit on a £45,000 Mercedes Benz and treat herself to a laptop, new clothes and furniture. She dipped into the school’s account again to spruce up her mum’s home after she went into care - spending money on a decorator, stone masonry and skip hire. Fraud experts also found a £3,985 payment to her husband’s credit card, £93,700 paid into personal bank accounts and payments to BUPA and Age Concern for family members. Ross, who was sentenced on Friday at Maidstone Crown Court, has been sacked from her job as business manager at the school. She was exposed when the council’s education finance department noticed suspicious transactions in the school’s bank accounts during an internal audit. Jailed: Ross was sentenced to three years in prison at Maidstone Crown Court . A joint investigation by Kent Police and Medway Council revealed Ross’s fraud spanned five years, starting in 2005. Ross, who had access to Temple Hill’s debit card and made the majority of the purchases on behalf of the school, debited the school account in multiple unauthorised transactions. And she secretly changed data on monthly documents to the council in a deliberate attempt to hide her fraud. Detective Constable Kim Jordan, of Kent Police, said: 'This investigation was long and protracted due to the multiple transactions that were under investigation and the time period during which these offences were committed. 'Ross was in a position of trust, which she totally disregarded for her own personal financial gain and she made every effort to try to disguise her dishonesty from her colleagues, the head teacher and Medway Council. 'She deprived Temple Mill Primary School and its pupils of much needed funds and every effort will now be made to reclaim the outstanding money. 'I hope today’s verdict acts as a deterrent for others.'","Confessed to using the school account to fund her mother’s care home bill, but also bought herself a laptop, new clothes and furniture .

The study, carried out by the World Luxury Index, found that it was classic designer staple Mulberry that prevailed as British online shoppers' luxury label of choice. Coach . Louis Vuitton . Chanel . Gucci . Longchamp . Prada . Hermès . Mulberry . Marc Jacobs . Michael Kors . In 2011 the company almost quadrupled its profits from the previous year. And with each bag owing its name to the celebrity who first endorsed it; it would appear that Alexa, Lily, Daria and Rosie have fast become the most popular girls in town. Starting at £550 however, they are certainly not cheap dates and to the music of many shopper's ears, high street stores are hot on the designer world's heels with great copies. More and more, the world wide web is where consumers confirm their desire for handbag brands, and increasingly, specific models. And consumers shift from the boutique to their smartphones, tablets and computers to learn more about the products they covet. The study also unveiled for the first time, a ranking and analysis of the most searched-for handbag brands within the luxury industry, based on the unbiased search inputs coming from global luxury consumers in major search engines. The research examines over 130 brands, through 130 million+ searches, in eight countries. Coach held the top spot as most-searched handbag brand, followed by Louis Vuitton and Chanel. As for Mulberry, which ranked eighth globally, the study found that every nation has a varying taste in style.

Sarah Harris, fashion features editor at Vogue, said: ‘In the late Eighties, to a soundtrack of Madonna’s Like A Virgin, white stilettos became synonymous with trashy mini-skirts and the sort of girls one’s mother referred to as “common”, and that was it – it was all over for the spiked heels in blinding, brilliant white.

The search for a British schoolboy who went missing in a storm in France resumed today amid rising fears for his safety. Pierre Barnes, 12, has not been seen since he set off on a solo bicycle ride on the tiny holiday island of Porquerolles on Saturday afternoon. He had just started a half-term holiday with his parents and brothers and sisters at the beauty spot, which is off France’s southern coast, close to Toulon. But Pierre’s bicycle - which has its chain missing - and one of his shoes were later found on a coastal parth, close to raging seas, swollen up by 80mph winds and driving rain. Pierre Barnes, pictured here with parents Stephen and Florence Barnes, went missing on Saturday afternoon while on a bicycle ride . The holiday island of Porquerolles, on the south coast of France, measures less than five square miles . Rescuers using a helicopter, boats . and sniffer dogs spent the weekend scouring the island for him, but had . to call the search off at night because of the worsening weather. Amid mounting fears for his safety, . Pierre’s father, Stephen Barnes, a 57 year-old director of a property . company, said: ‘I am certain he went off on an adventure on his bicycle . but in the forest all the little tracks look the same. ‘He is lost but he is a strong boy . and I hope he found a place to sleep where there was not too much wind. It’s difficult to say what you can do when you are cold and frightened.’ Mr Barnes, from Grantham, Lincs, and . his wife of almost 20 years, Florence, 43, originally from Moisenay, a . short distance to the south-east of Paris, maintained a vigil at a local . fire station. They were joined by their other three . children, aged 17, 15 and 13 on the island, which covers four square . miles and is inhabited by 200 people. Today police suggested Pierre could have become disoriented as some of the worst storms in the past decade lashed the island. Paul Mourier, the local prefect, said . there was ‘always hope’ Pierre might be found - pointing out the . ‘incredible resilience’ of children in his age group. Police patrol: Gendarmes search for the missing 12-year-old in difficult weather conditions including poor visibility and 80mph winds . Mounting concerns: A sniffer dog has been deployed employed by police in the hunt for Pierre . However, Mr Mourier said not a single person had come forward to report seeing Pierre since Saturday afternoon. He said that temperatures dropped to minus 5C at night. The schoolboy was wearing dark . trousers and a green top, and would have been easily remembered as he . cycled alone on such a small island. Mr Mourier said counsellors were . among those offering support to the Barnes family, and that both . Pierre’s parents were taking part in the search. The island’s tracks and paths are extremely narrow and in some places are dangerously close to cliffs. Vanished: A helicopter patrol searches the French island of Porquerolles where Pierre Barnes was last seen cycling yesterday afternoon .

She has enjoyed two years of quality time with her loving family and has just seen the birth of her fifth great-grandchild. But if hospital doctors had had their way, none of this would have been possible for Margaret Kibble. Her relatives told yesterday how the 95-year-old was put on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway after medical professionals said she was about to die. Recovery: Margaret Kibble with granddaughter Emily . She was only taken off it when family members heard her begging for water and ordered staff to put the great grandmother back on food and fluids. Now, 22 months on, she is still enjoying life back at home. The Liverpool Care Pathway, which involves the sedation of patients and the removal of tubes giving them food and fluids, was designed to ease the suffering of the terminally ill in their final hours. But there are concerns that a number of patients have been put on the pathway without it being explained to their family and when they are not in their final hours of life. Mrs Kibble was admitted to hospital in Lewisham, south-east London, in January 2011 with severe bleeding a month after she had a heart attack. Initially, doctors told her daughter and son-in-law that she had minutes to live, but she repeatedly defied expectations. Her condition appeared to stabilise and she was moved to a ward. But she was then placed in a side room on her own and during one visit her family claim hospital staff suddenly removed all her drips and feeding tubes without telling them what was going on. Her son-in-law Graham Satchell, 57, said: ‘They walked in, took off her drips, took everything away, turned off the monitor and everything else. Controversial: Margaret was put on the pathway in December 2010 but her family, including Margaret's daughter Annette and her husband Graham (pictured) demanded she was taken off it and nearly two years later she is still alive . That night we were not even allowed to give her any water, but we basically ignored it and my daughter Emily wet her mouth with a tissue.’ Emily Satchell, 24, said: ‘The fact they wouldn’t let me give her a drink was horrible because she kept saying she wanted water and I had to say you cannot have it. 'I was upset and gave it to her.’ The next day Mr Satchell asked for a meeting with doctors to find out what was happening. He said: ‘That’s when it got explained what was really going on, that she was on the Liverpool Care Pathway. ‘I just lost it big time and they put all the drips back on. I think they were doing it to calm me down, but she started to come round. Then the next morning we walked in and all the doctors were around her bed. We thought, “Oh, she’s gone”. But she was sitting up in bed having a cup of tea. It was unbelievable.’ Mrs Kibble suffers from dementia and has carers four times a day, but her family said that they could not have allowed her to die. Mr Satchell said: ‘She’s had two years of life, she’s seen two newborn babies. Yes, she has her moments, but what do you expect? She’s 95 years old. ‘In hospital there was no care. I understand that they see dead people every day, but I don’t and I wasn’t having that.’ Last week, the Department of Health announced an investigation into the LCP following concerns highlighted by the Mail. But it will be run by a Health Department organisation, the National End of Life Care Programme, and medical organisations that have been deeply involved in promoting and operating the pathway. MPs and doctors have criticised the inquiry for not being independent. A spokesman for Lewisham Hospital NHS Trust said: ‘We take patients’ complaints seriously, however, we cannot comment on this case until we’ve had a chance to investigate fully.’","Margaret Kibble was placed on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway .

Job application: Tony Blair said a directly-elected President of Europe would help prevent the break-up of the EU . ‘In order to restore confidence in . the euro area, countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to . the European level,’ Mr Draghi told the German magazine Der Spiegel. ‘A lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national . sovereignty a long time ago. Because, in the past, they have allowed . their debt to pile up, they now need the goodwill of the financial . markets. That sounds like a paradox, but it is nonetheless true. ‘Only when the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the European level will they gain sovereignty.’ Mr Blair, who has made clear his desire for another major job in politics, said in a major speech at the Council for the Future of Europe in . Berlin that voters across the continent should elect ‘a big post held by one person’ to reinvigorate enthusiasm for the European project. He said: ‘If eurozone structures end up with a Europe that is . fundamentally divided politically as well as economically; rather than a . Europe with one political settlement that accommodates different levels . of integration within it, the EU as we know it will be on a path to . break up.’ But he added: ‘Out of this European crisis can come the opportunity . finally to achieve a model of European integration that is sustainable. A . Europe-wide election for the presidency ... is the most direct way to . involve the public. ‘An election for a big post held by one person – this people can . understand. The problem with the European Parliament is that though . clearly democratically elected, my experience is people don’t feel close . to their MEPs.’ He . claimed too few people knew who their MEPs are, and a powerful . figurehead straddling the continent would stop people feeling . ‘alienated’ from Brussels. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Blair is a 'man who would sell his country for the bauble of EU office' Critics said the comments, in a speech in Berlin, were a blatant pitch for the job but hoped his ambitions would be thwarted. Mr Blair warned that the European Union would break-up if it was unable to resolve the crisis over the eurozone. But if greater integration in the single currency bloc created a two or three-speed Europe, it could spell the end of the EU as it currently stands. In his address to the Nicolas Berggruen Institute on Governance,  he said a directly-elected EU president could bridge the growing ‘democratic deficit’ between the people of Europe and politicians in Brussels. Designing a new union will be ‘very difficult’, he said. ‘The danger is that the more we talk of “bringing Europe closer to the people”, the more “the people” feel alienated from it. ‘A Europe wide election for the Presidency of the Commission or Council is the most direct way to involve the public. ‘An election for a big post held by one person – this people can understand. ‘The problem with the European Parliament is that though clearly democratically elected, my experience is people don’t feel close to their MEP’s. ‘This could change but only if the European Parliament and National parliaments interact far more closely.’ He also issued a ‘stark warning’ that if eurozone structures ‘end up with a Europe that is fundamentally divided politically as well as economically; rather than a Europe with one political settlement that accommodates different levels of integration within it, the EU as we know it will be on a path to break up’. But opponents of Mr Blair were scathing about his hopes of leading a federal Europe. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, said: ‘This is the man who would sell his country for the bauble of EU office. This a man who cannot be trusted with our or any other country's future. ‘He hopes that the EU can in some way have one speed while travelling at two. It just isn't possible. His hopes will be dashed, as I hope will his ambitions.’","Former Prime Minister claims a 'big post held by one person' would make voters feel closer to Brussels .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:22 EST, 20 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:33 EST, 21 May 2012 . Getting married was a savvy business decision as well as a personal milestone for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, divorce lawyers claimed today. The timing of the wedding, the day after the company's initial public offering, could be particularly advantageous for Zuckerberg, who saw his net worth soar to $19.1 billion. Any pre-nuptial agreement signed by the couple, commonplace for the super-rich when they marry, would have forced Zuckerberg and his new bride Priscilla Chan to agree exactly how to split assets - including his Facebook stock - if their marriage broke up in future. In a marriage without a pre-nup, or if the couple had remained unmarried, she could be entitled to half of his wealth under Californian law. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wed: Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan married in a surprise ceremony in Palo Alto, California on Saturday . A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment on whether the couple signed such the agreement. Priscilla Chan and Zuckerberg share a modest house in Palo Alto, California, where they were married on Saturday. The couple met as undergraduates at Harvard University in 2004. Zuckerberg, now 28, dropped out of college to work on Facebook, while Chan, a pediatrician, stayed to earn her undergraduate degree in 2007. Chan's work led to Facebook creating an organ donation page. Had they continued just to live together without getting married, Chan could potentially lay claim to a much larger portion of assets, including a chunk of his $20 billion in Facebook shares, lawyers said. Robert Blevans, a lawyer based in Napa, California, said: 'In California, people who live together without the benefit of marriage could claim they had an agreement to pool resources and efforts.' Status update: Mr Zuckerberg announced the news on his own personal Facebook page . He said although they are hard to prove, 'those claims can get really ugly'. Mr Blevans cited the case of Anthony Maglica, the founder of the company that makes Maglite flashlights. In 1994, an Orange County court awarded $84 million to Maglica's girlfriend Claire, who took his name and lived with him for 23 years. Although an appeals court reversed the award in 1998, she later negotiated a $29 million settlement. The same logic - avoiding messy court fights - is part of the reasoning behind a prenuptial agreement. 'One of the primary reasons that wealthy people enter into prenups is to prevent the type of carnage that can come with divorce,' said Garrett Dailey, an appellate attorney in Oakland. 'Better to sort it out in advance.' A prenuptial agreement in California typically states how spouses would divide assets in the event of a divorce. The couple usually waives the right to make claims based on community-property laws, which state that any property created after the marriage is essentially community property and should be split evenly after any divorce. Married: The couple have been together for nine years, but did not reveal their engagement . California is one of a handful of states with community-property laws. Most states rely on equitable-division rules, which give more flexibility to a judge in dividing assets. In Chan's case, she could lay claim to a portion of the options and grants in Facebook stock that vest during the time of their marriage, lawyers said. If there were no prenup, or if there were and Chan contested it, she could also try to go after stock Zuckerberg held previously if she could claim it increased in value during the relationship and the increase was due directly to Zuckerberg's efforts. Lawyers said that is hard to prove for publicly-traded companies. 'In an organization of this size, that's not going to happen,' Blevans said. But still, in case of such a clash, it would likely help Zuckerberg that the marriage took place the day after the initial public offering. Sold: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is thought to have bought this $7 million mansion in Palo Alto, California as his first ever home . 'The value of the company is absolutely known,' said Dailey. 'There's no dispute over it.' If the timing of the marriage so close to the IPO was accidental, 'then it was a very nice coincidence,' said Blevans. Getting married after Zuckerberg achieved such a high level of success probably made the couple at least consider a prenuptial agreement. 'If they had gotten married in college, it probably wouldn't have occurred to them,' said Jennifer Saslaw, an attorney at Moradi Saslaw LLP in San Francisco. Lawyers said there was no guarantee the couple signed an agreement, citing divorce cases involving wealthy people such as actor Mel Gibson and singer Paul McCartney who skipped prenups. But they say it is likely they did. 'In every single state, a wealthy person is better with a prenup,' said Dailey. 'I cannot comprehend Zuckerberg marrying without one.' Flotation: Mr Zuckerberg opened trading on the Nasdaq on Friday, the day of Facebook's IPO . Donald Trump took to the airwaves in an effort to encourage Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to insist upon using a pre-nuptial agreement before marrying his longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan. The only thing 'The Donald' didn't know was that said advice was more timely than he expected. The real estate tycoon phoned in an appearance on a CNBC financial show last Tuesday, just four days before Ms Chan and Mr Zuckerberg tied the knot in a secret ceremony in their Palo Alto backyard. Low-key: The newlyweds got married in their back yard in Palo Alto, California . Because Facebook's long-awaited IPO was due to take place last Friday, Mr Trump decided to steer the conversation onto Mr Zuckerberg's increased wealth. Having been divorced twice himself, and going into a very public court battle with wife number 1 over their pre-nup, Mr Trump could be considered an expert on the problem of shielding riches from ex-wives. 'So the question is [that Zuckerberg] has this lovely girlfriend - I'm sure she's lovely - and they get married, and if for some reason over the next couple years they get divorced, and then she sues him for $10billion and she hit the jackpot like no body!' he said on Squawk Box. 'In New York, she would get a big chunk of what he has.' That total continues to grow, and the launch of the Facebook IPO increased his net worth to $19.1billion. While host Andrew Ross Sorkin made the point that since Ms Chan has been dating Mr Zuckerberg since the beginning of Facebook, she could make the case that she would deserve a sizeable amount of her husband's assets. Mr Trump, who low-balled her deserved earnings, said that he could predict her lawyer's case if the issue ever went to court. He predicted that her hypothetical lawyers would argue 'without her and her brilliant decision making it would've never come through and it would have never existed, she advised him and she made dinner for him and she's entitled to $10billion. 'Look, I am notoriously cheap with these things so I would say if she made a million dollars that would be very good.' Financial analysts would likely side with Mr Trump, as agreeing to a set pre-nup saves much legal hassle in the case of divorce.

A stunning bracelet given to a Russian dancer by the King of Siam is set to go under the hammer for £8,000. The ornate pure gold 2oz bracelet with an enamel picture of the Thai royal family was given to Nadia Yerusalimsky in around 1912 by the then King Vajiravudh - King Rama VI. It is thought the dancer bewitched His Majesty when she performed at the palace after moving to Bangkok with her father who was a tailor. King and I: The bracelet was a gift from King Rama VI, the grandson of the monarch who supposedly was the inspiration for the story, turned 1956 musical film, The King and I . King Rama VI was the grandson of King Rama IV, the monarch who was supposedly the inspiration for the story, turned 1956 musical film 'The King and I'. The real-life story imitates the film, based on the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon, starring Yul Brynner as the king who falls for a Victorian governess played by Deborah Kerr. But unlike the film, Ms Yerusalimsky went on to marry another man, Welshman Henry Hopkin in Bangkok in 1916. Now their grandchildren are putting up the historic piece of jewellery for auction on November 1. Bewitched by dancer: The King of Siam gave the bracelet to Nadia Yerusalimsky (left with unidentified dancer) in about 1912 after she performed at the palace in Bangkok . For sale: The pure gold 2oz bracelet, which features this enamel picture, is now going under the hammer as the dancer's grandchildren put it up for sale at auction on November 1 . Auctioneer Thomas Plant, from Special Auction Services, Berkshire, said: ‘Although this has great value because it is almost completely pure gold, if not 99.9 percent, it's the history and romance behind it that is the real story. ‘King Rama VI was the grandson and the king who many think was the inspiration for the film and book the 'King and I' ‘And with this gift to Nadia it was in many ways a case of history repeating itself as it appears this king was very fond of her. ‘I don't think would have happened after the time of the Great War, this was a more innocent time. Pure gold: The bracelet has seven gold bullet coins from the time of Rama V, King Chulalongkorn in the 1870s and is expected to fetch £8,000 at auction . ‘Nadia actually went on to marry a rather naughty Welshman Henry Hopkin who had fled to Bangkok after having an affair with the village policeman's wife. ‘Henry, from Wales, and Nadia, from Russia, were married in Bangkok in 1916 and went on to have two children together.’ The bracelet features seven gold bullet coins from the time of Rama V , King Chulalongkorn, in the 1870s with two impressed strike marks, one for Chakra, the other possibly for Rama V, joined by oval links. A circular medallion with enamel design for the Siamese Royal family is then joined to it by a later loop clasp.

A Labour MP today defied his wife, daughters and party bosses and refused to apologise after telling former Tory politician Louise Mensch to ‘shut up’. Austin Mitchell sparked a furious storm on Twitter after criticising author Mrs Mensch for contradicting her husband over why she quit the Commons last month. The Grismby MP tweeted: ‘Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn't lie about why she quit politics.’ Defiant Labour MP Austin Mitchell today refused to withdraw his tweets that Louise Mensch should should 'shut up' and remember 'A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public' Ms Mensch has insisted she resigned from her Corby seat for family reasons, saying she was ‘struggling’ to balance her parliamentary work and family life when she resigned in the summer. But veering wildly off message, Peter Mensch said in a newspaper interview that she stepped down because she feared she would never be promoted to minister and would ‘get killed’ by Labour in the next General Election. Mrs Mensch then took Twitter to deny his side of the story.  She also reposted a message  from one of her followers on the site  who suggested Mr Mensch ‘might be in for  a b******ing’. Today Mr Mitchell weighed in with the tweet criticising Mrs Mensch. Mr Mitchell tweeted today telling Ms Mensch she was wrong to contradict her husband . After being bombarded with criticism from Twitter users, a defiant Mr Mitchell revealed his wife had banned him from tweeting again . But he was soon back to insist he would not withdraw the offending tweet, despite being told to do so by his wife, children and Labour party press advisers . After being bombarded with abuse from other users, he added: ‘Calm down dears. Irony may be a low form of wit but it's clearly above my level. And yours. So my wife has banned me from tweeting today.’ And as the row refused to go away he revealed he had been told by Labour HQ and his to withdraw the remark. ‘Wife, three daughters, one granddaughter and Labour press office all demand that I withdraw my tweet.No chance of front bench now.’ A Labour source said: 'Austin Mitchell has made clear the tweet was a joke, not a serious comment. It's not funny, understandable that people find it offensive, and it is not the view of the Labour Party.' Mr Mitchell later insisted he 'loved' Mrs Mensch and suggested the message should be taken as a joke. He said: ‘It was ironic. I'm surprised that people have taken it so negatively. What happened to humour?"" Mrs Mensch took to the site to respond to Mr Mitchell and demanded a 'a repudiation from Ed Miliband'. She added: 'My husband is my partner. And it's 2012. Feminism.' A month ago Mrs Mensch moved to New York, . where her music mogul husband is based, with her three children from her . first marriage, in an attempt to ‘keep [her family] together’. Clash: Louise Mensch has been forced to deny allegations made by her husband Peter in a newspaper interview that she quit her role as an MP because she didn't think she would win at the next election . Mr Mensch, 59, who manages rock acts . including Def Leppard and Metallica, said in yesterday's newspaper interview: ‘The problem . was any number of issues. 'Number one, Louise’s ex-husband is American . and has moved back there. 'Then there was my business. ‘Then there was Louise’s belief that . she was only going to be an MP for three more years. 'She thought – and I . wasn’t going to argue with her – that she’d get killed in the next . election. 'So, to her, it seemed much more short-term than my job as a . manager. ‘And listen, they hadn’t promoted her . yet, and it’s not like she thought she had a future because perhaps she . felt she was too outspoken.’ Denying her husband’s claims, Mrs . Mensch wrote on Twitter: ‘Nothing, repeat nothing, influenced decision . to resign other than inability to hold family life together away from . him. ‘Can honestly say I had no fear whatsoever of defeat at next election since had already decided not to stand again.’ But she conceded that her husband ‘doesn’t do on-message and I love him for it’. One of the so-called ‘Cameron . cuties’, Mrs Mensch won the Corby seat for the Conservatives in 2010 . after it had been in Labour hands for 13 years. Labour is expected to . regain the seat in next month’s by-election which was triggered by her . departure. This summer she announced she would be relocating to New York with her three children, where her husband is based. Her sudden departure, three years before the next election has gone down badly with her party, and she was booed and heckled when she appeared on a film screen at the Conservative party conference. Labour, who have a 15 point lead, are expected to win the seat back next month. In an interview with the Sunday Times, New York-born Mr Mensch, 59, whose rock acts include Def Leppard and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, said the couple had considered settling in England but his wife was not sure she had a future in the party. The pair met in 1990 when she was a student at Oxford University and he, at 37, was married and already a leading light in the music industry who she had invited to speak in a debate at the Oxford Union. Denial: Louise Mensch took to Twitter to respond to her husbands claims in the interview . Setting the record straight: Mrs Mensch said that her family life was the reason she quit as MP for Corby . Mr Mensch said he would stick to music following his wife's response to the interview . She married and had three children with her first husband and forged a career as a best-selling Chick Lit author under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe, but got back in contact with Mensch after she divorced and within several months he had left his wife and they married in 2011. Mr Mensch said while she ‘really liked the job a lot’, he said she did not see her children often enough and thought being with him in the US - where the father of her children also lives, had a ‘greater lure’ than a career in British politics. Manager: Peter Mensch looks after bands including the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, pictured, and Def Leppard . He expressed surprise his wife was constantly on call as an MP, saying ‘I couldn’t manage Louise and that mushrooming situation.’ His own political views, he joked, are ‘to the left of Trotsky’ They have been living as family in New York for just a month. The MP yesterday retweeted a message from one of her Twitter followers which said ‘he [her husband] might be in for a b******ing’. But she conceded that her husband ‘doesn’t do on message and I love him for it’ and said she would be ‘thinking of creative ways he can make it up to me.’ The MP, who has set up a social networking site in the States called Menshn, would not, according to her husband, walk into a TV career. He said: ‘She’s not going to instantly walk on TV like Piers Morgan, who was a big personality when CNN hired him. Louise is just an MP.’","Austin Mitchell tells former Tory MP she must remember 'a good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public'

"By . Matt Chorley and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 19:45 EST, 28 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:08 EST, 29 October 2012 . Recommendations: Lord Heseltine is expected to make it harder for foreign companies to buy British firms . Tory divisions over how the get the economy moving are expected to be exposed this week when Lord Heseltine challenges the government to do more to bolster Britain’s regions. The former deputy prime minister will publish a report proposing sweeping changes to the way local economies are run, drawing on his experience as a minister in Margaret Thatcher’s government. The report on how to . stimulate economic growth is expected to lead to a clash with the . Coalition on a range of issues. Days after figures showed Britain had emerged from the longest double-dip recession for 50 years, Mr Osborne is under pressure to ensure faltering economic growth continues. Lord Heseltine is expected to criticise the jumble of Government schemes aimed at . helping businesses weather the economic storm, and suggest giving local . Chambers of Commerce more powers and public money. The . Tory peer will also recommend . cuts to red tape and some business taxes as well as a shake-up of local . government. Lord Heseltine’s report will be . delivered to Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable on Wednesday, . but panicked officials are already holding meetings on how to respond . to it. He is expected to demand a public interest test to prevent foreign takeovers from damaging national interests, thousands of civil servants be moved out of London and the creation of new regional bodies in charge skills and training. The proposals are said to have caused ‘discomfort in the Treasury’ with many of the ideas apparently advocating the recreation of Labour’s vast and costly Regional Development Agencies which the coalition scrapped. The idea of setting up a new network of quangos would prove costly at a time when government is still under pressure to save billions of pounds. Lord Heseltine, who has been given an office in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, is understood to advocate greater state intervention in local economies, favoured by Mr Cable, a Lib Dem minister. One Whitehall source said: 'He is clear that the state can do more. Not Labour-style state subsidy, but also not the laissez-faire approach that some in government would prefer.' Mr Osborne’s aides insist he is relaxed about the report, and expects to welcome much of its contents. A Treasury spokesman said: 'We are very much looking forward to receiving it.' Whitehall sources said that former . deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine is likely to propose a tightening . of the rules following a string of controversial bids for British firms. The . move is expected to be resisted by senior ministers, who believe a . political test for policing foreign ownership runs the risk of becoming . protectionist. Labour’s . 2002 Enterprise Act introduced major reforms of the regime – including a . new competition test for assessing mergers and takeovers, to be used in . most cases. This replaced a broader public interest test, which some are now arguing should be reintroduced. Significantly, Mr Cable was in favour of the idea in opposition. Days before the 2010 election, he said: 'It shouldn’t be nationalistic. The issue is not whether there is a foreign bidder, it’s about whether it’s in the interests of the British economy. 'The Government removed this provision in 2002 and we’re now seeing the damage done by opening up a complete free-for-all. 'We need to protect firms from takeovers forced through by hedge funds for short-term profit that’s not in the long-term interests of the British economy.' 'Cadbury law': A protester demonstrating outside the head office of Cadbury in Birmingham, in 2010 as the British confectioner said it had agreed to a £12bn takeover from U.S. giant Kraft . The reforms were dubbed the ‘Cadbury . law’, after Kraft’s £12billion takeover of the British confectioner . prompted a backlash from politicians and unions who argued it was too . easy for foreign predators to snap up British companies. Recently, there was controversy over a proposed merger between British defence giant BAE and European rival EADS. The deal collapsed earlier this month but industry experts warn that BAE is vulnerable to a takeover approach. Labour . leader Ed Miliband has suggested changes are needed to defend the . long-term interests of British business against ‘fund managers chasing . the fast buck’. Lord Heseltine will also demand major . new powers and extra funding be handed to regional bodies, freed from . control by ministers in London. ‘Whitehall has local authorities by the short and curlies and you have got to break that monopoly,’ he declared last year. He is likely to call for an end to . the two-tier council system, where district and county councils divide . responsibility for services. But Tory ministers have repeatedly . criticised the idea of more unitary authorities running local areas. In . May 2010 Communities Secretary Eric Pickles pulled the plug on unitary . councils in Exeter and Norwich, branding them ‘ludicrous’ and an . ‘expensive distraction’.","Lord Heseltine’s ideas on how to .

Lovesick patients are increasingly using Facebook to flirt with, proposition and harass their doctors. The number of medics seeking help to deal with unwanted advances has risen by a third as technology, including emails and text messages, erodes boundaries and makes contact easier, the Medical Defence Union has warned. It said that although some flirtations quickly fizzle out, in the worst cases the police are called in and injunctions taken out to stop doctors from being stalked or harassed. The number of medics seeking help to deal with unwanted advances has risen by a third (file picture) Medics are even finding themselves in danger of being struck off after being falsely accused of having a relationship with a patient who is infatuated with them. Dr Claire Macaulay, of the MDU, which provides legal advice and insurance to doctors, said: ‘The trend towards patients making unsolicited advances to their doctor is not a new one. ‘But while in the past patients were likely to put pen to paper when making such approaches, patients are now using digital means. Our members report that  being bombarded with messages to their mobiles or email, Twitter or Facebook accounts can, in some ways, be even more intrusive than receiving a stream of written letters.’ In one case, a male GP began to receive letters and gifts from a patient with mental health problems. The woman was told the contact was inappropriate but  continued to send letters and also sent repeated friend requests on Facebook. Although some flirtations are said to quickly fizzle out, in the worst cases police are being called and injunctions taken out (file picture) After her care was transferred to another doctor in the practice, she told the General Medical Council she had had a sexual relationship with the first GP. The doctor denied this and  was cleared of any wrongdoing  – but only after a six-month investigation. In another example, a female GP was asked out for a drink by a male patient as she left her surgery. When she declined, the patient pestered her via Facebook, and sent her lilies, after reading on the site that they were her favourite flower. On the MDU’s advice, the doctor changed the security and  privacy settings on the site, so that only a few chosen friends could see the information she had posted. Another doctor brought charges after being sent lingerie catalogues and stalked by an ex-patient. Lovesick patients are increasingly using Facebook to flirt with their GP (picture posed by a model) Between 2002 and 2006, the MDU, Britain’s biggest insurer of GPs, received 73 requests for help in dealing with unwanted advances. This rose to 100 from 2007 to 2011. Seventy-two of the 100 cases involved GPs, the others were hospital doctors including psychiatrists and gynaecologists. Almost three-quarters of those being pursued and propositioned were male. Doctors are advised not to respond to advances made through social networking sites. If the problem continues, the patient’s care can be transferred to a colleague. Other advice includes withholding mobile numbers when calling patients and exercising caution before accepting gifts. Dr Clare Gerada, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said patients can sometimes  mistake doctors’ professional care for personal interest. ‘Patients see doctors when they are vulnerable, and doctors  are trained to maintain professional boundaries at all times,’ she said. ‘In some cases, however, where there may be vulnerable patients who have experienced traumatic events, they might misinterpret their doctor’s compassion for something stronger.’","Patients are increasingly turning to Facebook to flirt with and harass medical professionals the Medical Defence Union has warned .

Up to 5,000 mental health patients could have been sectioned in the last decade by doctors who had not been properly approved, Jeremy Hunt revealed today. The Health Secretary said emergency legislation would be drawn up after discovering ‘irregularities’ in the way as many as 2,000 doctors were authorised to assess patients for detention under the 1983 Mental Health Act. Since 2002, doctors in four regions had been sending patients to mental health institutions – including the Ashworth and Rampton secure hospitals, home to some of Britain’s most notorious prisoners – without being properly cleared. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said 2,000 doctors in four regions were not legally cleared to section patients . The serious error only came to light last week, but Mr Hunt insisted no-one had been locked up who should not have been. Doctors were supposed to have been approved to detain patients under the Mental Health Act by Strategic Health Authorities. But in four areas - North East, Yorkshire and Humber, West Midlands; and East Midlands – authorisation was delegated to local mental health trusts. Dr Geoffrey Harris, chairman of NHS South, will undertake an independent review to look 'at how this responsibility was delegated' by the four Strategic Health Authorities. Mr Hunt told the Commons: ‘Our latest best estimate is that 2,000 doctors were not properly approved and that they have participated in the detention of between 4,000 and 5,000 current patients within institutions in both the NHS and independent sectors. ‘There is no suggestion that hospitalisation or detention of any patient has been clinically inappropriate, nor that the doctors so approved are anything other than properly qualified to make such recommendations, nor that these doctors might have made incorrect diagnoses or decisions about the treatment patients need. ‘All the proper clinical processes were gone through when these patients were detained. We believe no-one is in hospital who shouldn’t be, and no patients have suffered because of this.’ He said doctors recommending patients to be locked up would not have known they had not been properly approved to make such recommendations and had ‘acted in good faith’. Labour agreed to back to the government in changing the law. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'Detaining people under the Mental Health Act raises the most serious issues of fundamental rights and of patient and public safety. 'Any reported failure will therefore always be a matter of the highest concern.' He praised Mr Hunt's 'pragmatic approach... to this difficult issue'. Mr Burham added: 'Failure to act would potentially cause unnecessary distress and uncertainty to many thousands of vulnerable patients and their families and present risks to public safety. 'So while we will press him for answers, his action is justified, and he will have our support in removing any uncertainty.'","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt tells the Commons 2,000 doctors in four regions were not legally cleared to section people .

A toddler has had his skull broken and fitted with springs, after he was born with a rare genetic condition that stopped his head from growing. Coban Sykes was born without a soft spot in his skull, which means it is unable to expand to accommodate his growing brain. The condition, known as Muenke's Syndrome, affects just one in 30,000 children. The brave 19-month-old underwent a four-hour operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital last week to ease the . pressure. It has left him with 85 stitches and a . delicately attached section of skull, which doctors warned might move . leaving his head flat or parts of his brain exposed. Coban with his mother Nicola: His skull will need to be broken again in six months to allow his brain to continue to grow . Meanwhile his family have padded every room in their house to stop him from hurting himself. Coban faces more operations as he grows and without treatment he would go blind and deaf. He will have further springs added between a membrane on the outside of his brain and skull in April. The surgery is known as posterior skull vault expansion using springs. His mother Nicola, from Wombwell, South Yorkshire, said caring for her son was a 24-hour job because the slightest bump to his head can worsen his condition. She said: 'He has had this disability . from birth and we were hoping he wouldn’t need an operation for a while . but his eye sight started deteriorating in September and the doctors at . Great Ormond Street said it was important he have the operation then. Coban was born with Muenke's Syndrome, which means his skull has fused too early. Right: with mother Nicola, father Mark and sisters Rianna, 6, and Evie, 4 . 'When he was first born the soft spot at the top of his head was fused, which meant his head couldn’t accommodate his growing brain. That led to him having an abnormal shaped skull because his brain was pushing to grow. 'They’ve opened his skull and put metal springs at the back to give him a bit of room and in six months they will need to break it at the front to do the same again as he keeps growing.' His family, including sisters Rianna, six and Evie, four, are now having to adjust to to their new routine at home. Nicola said: 'The problem is, he can’t have a helmet on as his skull is moving around after the operation and a helmet would make it misshappen and cause him problems. 'So it meant that we’ve got to somehow find padding for everything in the house, walls, cot, bed, everything really because the slightest knock can be very serious for him. 'It’s very dangerous for him now, basically his head his like a sponge and because he’s toddling we’re having to follow him constantly to make sure he doesn’t walk in to something. 'We’ve had a difficult time of it. It hasn’t been easy. It’s all come at once to be honest and having to travel to London isn’t easy - especially because he’s got two older sisters at school. 'Coban needs 24-hour care, and because of what he’s been through with the operations he’s very clingy. We just need a bit of help really.'

Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the company’s disastrous IPO damaged the company’s image during his first interview since the company went public in May. ‘The performance of the stock has obviously been disappointing,’ the Facebook founder, chairman and CEO said while being questioned at a technology conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. While talking about his personal coding skills, Zuckerberg tellingly said to applause: ‘Everything I do breaks, but we fix it quickly’. His interview comes amid massive turmoil within the company, as four senior executives have left in recent months and the company's morale is predictably low after their share price dropped to nearly half of what it was when they launched. Under fire: Mark Zuckerberg had his first interview since his company went public in May . Zuckerberg broke his silence at Tech Crunch Disrupt, answering questions posed by the conference’s founder Michael Arrington who has been critical of the social networking company in the past. Mr Arrington asked about how the . dramatic decrease in stock worth has affected the company’s morale and . Zuckerberg was blunt in responding: ‘Well it doesn’t help.’ The . hardest-hit by the dropping share price -which . initially launched at $38-per-share in May and now stands at a paltry . $19.48 - are employees who are . paid partially in stock, but the 28-year-old multi-billionaire said that . the company takes the lackluster stock price into consideration when . doling it out for salary. ‘We haven’t really done anything on equity to incentivise people,’ he said. ‘The . way that we do compensation is we translate the amount of cash we give . you into shares so if the shares are undervalued’ they give employees . more stock to equate to the amount they feel is fair. ‘We're going to do the things we think will build value over the long run,’ Zuckerberg explained while justifying the decision to go public. ‘We are a mission-driven company’ which he said tends to look to their larger goal of making the world more open and transparent, but like any business, ‘you can’t just focus on that.’ The sit down: Tech Crunch founder Michael Arrington, who has been critical of Facebook in the past, interviewed Zuckerberg for about 30 minutes on Tuesday afternoon . ‘The best people want to work on a mission they believe in but they also want to make a lot of money. ‘In order to do that we need to have a business model that makes a lot of money.’ ‘Building a mission and building a business goes hand in hand… the primary thing that makes me excited is about the mission.’ The decision to appear for the interview . was a clear effort by Zuckerberg to open up and re-energize the company . in hopes of stemming the exodus of key employees. Over the course of the summer, five . department heads all left the company, but today Zuckerberg said that he . feels now is the time to 'double down'. Focus on phones: While he said that he 'does everything' on his phone, he repeated past denials that the company is developing a phone of their own . 'I actually think that its a great time for people to stay,' he said, which was met with moderate applause. The appearance may have worked as well, with some analysts predicting that the talk helped increase Facebook's market capital by $1.7billion during the half-hour talk. The Facebook stock went up two per cent during after-hours trading, showing a positive response from the business world about the CEO's talk. Zuckerberg explained that he takes a inherently cautious approach when it comes to his evaluation of the company's public image. 'When people are writing nice stuff about us, it's important to get in front of the company and say, ""Don't believe all this."" When they write negative stuff, it's important to get in front of the company and say, ""Don't believe all this."" 'We are very self-critical too.' One of the mistakes that Zuckerberg pointed out was that they spent too long focusing on their HTML platform for the web as opposed to adapting and improving the product for mobile devices which he now firmly believes is the future of the network. He said that they underestimated 'how fundamentally good mobile is' for their growth. From a numbers perspective, he said a focus on mobile phones makes sense simply because they will have so many more prospective users as more people have phones than computers. That shift also makes financial sense for advertisers as engagement levels are higher on phones as well. 'I basically live on my mobile device,' Zuckerberg said. 'You know the founders letter in the S-1? I wrote that on my phone. I do everything on my phone.' Having fun: Zuckerberg admitted that his job is now more about achieving the mission of creating a more open web and while he did say he still had fun, his focus is more on building 'good stuff' Mr Arrington admitted that he has floated the theory that Facebook is developing their own physical phone for years- imagining a world where a group of engineers have been hidden away to create the new device- but Zuckerberg echoed his past denials repeatedly during the talk. He explained that it is better for Facebook to be available on all different mobile networks so that they can reach the most users no matter what type of phone they have, rather than spending time, money and energy developing their own product that would only get '10 million, 20 million people to use it. That doesn't move the needle for us!' 'Do you believe me yet? It's always been such a juicy story, but it's so clearly the wrong strategy for us,' he affirmed. In that same vein, Zuckerberg said that the company is actively developing their new Facebook app for Android but was non-committal when discussing a launch date, saying only that 'it will be ready when it's ready'. Another area that he confirmed is under improvement is the network's search function because he feels there is a depth of untapped potential for the tool since it typically just used to find people. 'We do on the order of a billion queries a day, and we're basically not even trying,' he said. Moving forward: He listed the Android app and improved search capabilities as two areas that the company is currently working on . What he said the company is interested in looking at are the way that Facebook can use the information about the user's friends and experiences to tailor the search. He gave the example of how can Facebook help a user find what sushi places their friends have been to in New York? Or what friends work at a particular company where the user wants to apply for a job? 'Facebook is uniquely positioned to give you answers,' he said. He gave nods to tech start ups like vacation home rental Airbnb, Spotify, and Instagram. Considering Zuckerberg was the one behind Facebook's $1billion acquisition of the photo-sharing service, it comes as little surprise that he said they were 'killing it'. While he remained upbeat and focused on the company's positive future in light of the discouraging IPO, he pointedly deflected to his dedication to the company's mission when asked if he was still having fun. 'For me it's not really about fun. It's about mission. It goes through waves. There are times when everyone thinks what we're doing is awesome. There are times when everyone is pessimistic. I would rather be in the cycle where people underestimate us. I would rather be underestimated. It gives us freedom to go out and do interesting stuff,' he said. 'When you look back 10 or 20 years from now, the legacy of this company should be that we've connected everyone in the world and they can share what they want.'","Mark Zuckerberg gave first interview since company went public .

A man is facing with charges of child abduction after he fell from a moving car, was run over and then in a bizarre twist, tried to steal the child of the couple who stopped to help him. Andre Bowman, 30, is believed to have been high on PCP when he tumbled out the vehicle on Saturday afternoon on Missouri's I-70 highway and Blue Ridge Boulevard, and was hit by another car. But he soon turned from victim to culprit when he grabbed one month old baby Emily from the back seat of the car belonging to Sarah Morris and Matthew Nicotra and refused to let go of her. Scroll down for video . Victim or culprit? Andre Bowman, allegedly high on PCP, fell from a car on a Missouri highway, was run over and then tried to kidnap the baby of the couple that stopped to help him . Like many, the couple had seen the man fall onto the busy highway and stopped to help but before they could do anything, Bowman was on his feet trying to open the passenger door of their car. Finding it was locked, the Kansas City resident then opened the back door where the couple's baby seat was positioned. Safe: Sarah Morris and Matthew Nicotra stopped to help Bowman who opened the back door of the car and tried to take one-month-old Emily from her seat . Write caption here . 'He was just trying to grab her out of the backseat and I got out and grabbed him and told him let go of my daughter. And he wouldn’t let go,' concerned father, Matthew Nicotra told Fox 4 News. Though Ms Morris and her husband are finding it hard to forgive Bowman for the attempted abduction, his behaviour can perhaps be better understood in the context of his own unfortunate circumstances. Perilous: Bowman was travellig along the I-70 near Kansas City when he tumbled from the car and was hit by another though why he fell has not been explained by police . Sad: Andre Bowman is said to be struggling with the recent death of his toddler, Ada, at the hands of his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend which may have prompted him to grab Emily (pictured) Close call: The couple had not even got out the car when Bowman got up from the ground and opened the rear passenger door . In early August of this year, Bowman's . own 18-month-old daughter Ada, died from head injuries and internal . bleeding caused by a sequence of mysterious events at her mother, Gina . Salazar's mobile home in Joplin, Missouri. Tragic: Andre Bowman's 18-month-old daughter Ada died last month from head injuries and internal bleeding . Salazar's boyfriend Bryant L. Sykes Jr., . 24, confessed to Newton County police that he picked the child up and . tossed her onto a bed in a moment of rage after she made a mess on the . floor of their home, the rebound of which threw her into a coffee table. But Sykes, who faces second degree murder charges, is blaming other bruises and injuries found on the victim's body on random domestic accidents. According to Sykes, the child fell out . of a window in one instance and then fell off a table she was sitting . on, but an autopsy suggests that her injuries were far more severe than . those that could have been caused by such 'accidents'. Though Andre Bowman and his ex- . girlfriend, 22, have been estranged for some time, and he had not been . involved in taking care of Ada, Angelicia, two, and Amileo, 3, he is now . seeking custody of the two remaining children. Two weeks ago he told Fox 4: . 'It affected me because all of my kids were real close, and I know right . now, they are thinking about their sister. 'For . a while I had to disappear out of their life. I don’t want them to be . confused anymore. I want them to know who their daddy is and to be with . me.' Real culprits: Bryant L. Sykes Jr, boyfriend of Ada's mother Gina Salazar, faces charges of second degree murder after he confessed to throwing the child. Bowman is seeking custody of his other two kids with Salazar . A friend of Bowman's said of the tragedy and his seemingly drug-addled frenzy: ''It's been a very traumatic, hard experience for him but in no means was he trying to cause harm to this child.' As an unidentified friend sobbed on her shoulder, the woman continued suggesting that when he saw Emily in the back of the car, 'he just snapped.' But Ms Morris responded: 'That's no right to grab my child at all, it's no right to grab anyone's child.' Bowman is still recovering a Kansas City area hospital while police have yet to respond as to why Bowman fell out of the car and who was driving the vehicle.","The incident occurred on the I-70 near Kansas City, Missouri .

The moment of truth: Ryan Swinburn could not collect his GCSE results until he paid his lunch bill . A teenager who almost died during a GCSE exam when he suffered a heart attack at his desk was banned from collecting his results - because he had an outstanding £5.60 lunch bill. Teachers told schoolboy Ryan Swinburn he could not have his exam grades until he paid for the pizza and baguette he had eaten months earlier. The 16-year-old had been unable to settle the canteen bill after he was rushed into hospital with multiple organ failure, having recently been diagnosed with cardiolipin syndrome. He was discharged from hospital in time to sit his GCSEs but almost died in May when he suffered a cardiac arrest during a maths exam. But he was shocked when he went to school to collect his results last month and was told they were being withheld because of the outstanding lunch debt. Ryan, from Rugby, Warwickshire, said: 'It was all a bit ludicrous really. 'I’ve had a tough time and because I wasn’t at school I wasn’t able to pay the bill. 'One of my teachers slyly told me I had got a C when I got there on the day so it really got me excited to see whether I had done the same in any other subjects. 'But when my head of year told me I couldn’t have them until I had settled a mere £5.60 - I was shocked. 'I hadn’t taken any money with me because I hadn’t really been thinking about the outstanding bill for a pizza, baguette and a drink - I was more concerned about my health. 'I suffer from high blood pressure and I don’t think that did me any good. 'I had to come away from the school not knowing if I had got into college or not, it was devastating and I was really angry.' Ryan was in his final year at Ashlawn . School in Rugby, when he was struck down with cardiolipin syndrome, . lupus disease and kidney failure. School Days: Ryan was in his final year at Ashlawn School in Rugby, Warwickshire . Exams: Ryan returned to Ashlawn School last month expecting to collect his GCSE results . He was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing dialysis and taking a daily cocktail of powerful steroids to control his condition. Incredibly, the dedicated teenager battled to become well enough to sit his GCSEs in May but was rushed back to hospital after collapsing just minutes after starting the first exam. The school agreed to award Ryan, who wants to study psychology and sociology at A-Level, his GCSEs based on his mock exam results and predicted grades. But when he went to school on August 31 to collect his results he was turned away at the door until he paid the canteen bill. He walked home and returned with his fuming mother Deborah Harris, 44, who stormed back to the school to demand an explanation. She said: 'Settling a £5 bill was the last thing on his mind - he has been seriously ill in hospital. 'He struggled to get to the school on that day but he was determined to collect his results with his friends. 'But he was humiliated in front of all his mates and this is the last thing he needed. Family: Ryan supported by his brothers Ross Took , 21 (left), and Toby Swinburn, 11 (right) 'I was also worried about his blood pressure because that can be high because of his illness. 'I thought they should at least show the lad a bit of compassion after what he has been through. 'I think it is disgusting how they treated him - it wasn’t even some random receptionist - it was his head of year who knew fully well what he had been through. 'I was told it was school policy. 'I explained how ill Ryan had been and felt she showed no compassion for my child. 'The whole situation was ludicrous - it was totally ridiculous. 'He really wants to go to college now, he really is a determined little thing and he’s had a rough ride.' A teacher finally handed over the results after Deborah agreed she would settle the canteen bill. Ryan achieved five Grade C GCSEs in Key Skills, English, Drama and Music, is now planning to study psychology and sociology at college.

'Rogue trader': Former UBS banker Kweku Adoboli allegedly lost his bank £1.4 billion in Britain's biggest banking fraud . A city trader who thought he had ‘the magic touch’ gambled away £1.4billion in Britain’s biggest banking fraud, a court heard. Kweku Adoboli, 32, is accused of acting as a ‘master fraudster’ to conceal the colossal losses he was making at the Swiss bank UBS. Southwark Crown Court heard how the former public school head boy was driven by ‘greed and ego’ on his reckless spree. His disastrous trades left a trail of ‘chaos and disaster’ landing the bank with losses of £1.4billion and wiping around £2.8billion off its share price. At one stage he faced losing UBS almost £7.4billion in unhedged investments. Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting, said: ‘This is not a one off, heat-of-the-moment rogue trader carried away on a wave of euphoria. Mr Adoboli was a gamble or two from destroying Switzerland’s largest bank.’ She described him as ‘a greedy banker, out of control and out for himself’. Jurors were told his losses would have been enough to pay a year’s salary for almost 70,000 nurses, build two Wembley stadiums or six hospitals. She said: ‘Mr Adoboli’s motive was to increase his bonus, his status within the bank, his job prospects and of course his ego. Like most gamblers, he believed he had the magic touch. ‘And like most gamblers, when he lost, he caused chaos and disaster to himself and all of those around him.’ Adoboli was described as a ‘trusted and admired’ member of his team who was rewarded with large bonuses for what his bosses thought were huge profits. But Miss Wass said: ‘Mr Adoboli’s greed got the better of him and he took advantage of the bank’s trust to cheat the system for his own gain.’ By the time his ‘pyramid of fraud’ collapsed, Adoboli was ‘throwing money wildly into the market hoping to dig himself out of the mess he had created’. She said: ‘In effect, Mr Adoboli had ceased to act as a professional investment banker and had begun to approach his work as a naked gambler. He had become what is sometimes referred to as a rogue trader. Mr Adoboli’s activities were more deliberate than that of a mere rogue trader. 'Motive': A court heard UBS investment banker Kweku Adoboli hoped to boost his bonus and position within the company as well as ego . Allegations: Kweku Adoboli is accused of making unauthorised trades when he worked for Swiss bank UBS in their London office . ‘He did not simply make a few wild . bets. He faked bookings, created false accounts and conducted himself as . a master fraudster, deliberately and systematically deceiving and . defrauding the bank.’ Miss Wass said Adoboli had . ‘fraudulently side-stepped’ rules that banned high-risk investments, . adding: ‘He was lying to... his senior managers, his risk-control . department, and the accounts department. ‘In effect he was risking the very existence of the bank by gambling its resources, ultimately for his own benefit.’ Adoboli worked in the global synthetic . equities division of UBS, where his career ‘progressed at great speed’. His salary soared from £50,000 with a £15,000 bonus in 2008 to £110,000 . with a £250,000 bonus in 2010. On trial: Kweku Adoboli, centre, arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he is accused of the biggest bank fraud in British history, flanked by his lawyers . Handcuffed: Kweku Adoboli, 32, is accused of two counts of fraud and two counts false accounting over the course of two years while working at UBS . Miss Wass said his income rose not . because he was a top trader but because, as he later admitted, it was . during this period that he began to fraudulently gamble the bank’s . money... to maximise his bonus and enhance his reputation as a top . trader’. But on September 14 last year, his . trades were challenged by UBS accountant William Steward. After speaking . to Mr Steward, Adoboli left his office that afternoon pretending to go . to a doctor’s appointment. Instead, Miss Wass said he sent Mr Steward a . ‘bombshell email’ in which he owned up. He was arrested the next day. In . the email, which was read to the court, he said: ‘Dear Will, It is with . great stress that I write this mail,’ before going on to describe how . Adoboli had hidden losses through other trades that initially made a . profit before losing more and more. Risking it all: Southwark Crown Court heard Adoboli stopped behaving like an investment banker and fell into a gambling mindset . He signed off: ‘I take full . responsibility for my actions and the s*** storm that will now ensue. I . am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my . bank and my colleagues at risk. Thanks, Kweku.’ Miss Wass said: ‘In the email, Mr . Adoboli clearly admits that, one – he fabricated deals; two – that he . invented non-existent clients; three – that he broke the rules; four – . that he lied to the supervisor; and five – he hoodwinked colleagues. ‘On September 14, his system crashed . like a car hitting a wall at high speed. He was left with no choice but . to admit exactly what he had been up to.’ The court was told Adoboli will claim . he was not acting dishonestly and that colleagues knew what he had been . doing. He denies two counts of fraud and two counts of false accounting. The trial continues. The court heard Kweku Adoboli eventually had to own up to what he had been doing and sent this email to chartered accountant William Steward:'Dear Will,It is with great stress that I write this mail. First of all the ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) trades that you see on the ledger are not trades that I have done with a counterparty as I previously described.I used the bookings as a way to suppress the PnL losses that I have accrued through off-book trades that I made. Those trades were previously profit making, became loss making as the market sold off aggressively through the aggressive sell-off days of July and early August.Initially, I had been short futures through June and those lost money when the first Greek confidence vote went through in mid-June. In order to try and make the money back I flipped the trade long through the rally.Although I had a couple of opportunities to unwind the long trade for a negligible loss, I did not move quickly enough for the market weakness on the back of the first back macro data and then an escalation Eurozone crisis cost me the losses you will see when the ETF bookings are cancelled. The aim had been to try and make the money back before the September expiry date came through but I clearly failed.These are still live trades on the book that will need to be unwound. Namely a short position in DAX futures [which had been rolled to December expiry] and a short position in S and P 500 futures that are due to expire on Friday.I have now left the office for the sake of discretion. I will need to come back in to discuss the positions and explain face to face, but for reasons that are obvious, I did not think it wise to stay on the desk this afternoon.I will expect that questions will be asked as to why nobody else was aware of these trades.The reality is that I have always maintained that these were EFP trades to the member of my team, BUC, trade support and John Di Bacco (Adoboli's manager).I take full responsibility for my actions and the s*** storm that will now ensue. I am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my bank and my colleagues at risk.Thanks, Kweku.'

There can’t be many one-bedroom terrace houses in Britain with a price tag of nearly £400,000. But then again, there can’t be many with a view as spectacular as the one from 1 The Turnpike in Strete, Devon. The house overlooks Start Bay, one of the most magnificent stretches of coastline in the West Country. Besides its stunning vista, the house has the distinction of playing a role in the effort to defeat Nazi Germany during the Second World War. The terrace dates from the 19th Century and was one of scores of dwellings in the area commandeered by the Ministry of Defence in 1943 to house American troops training for the D-Day landings. Stunning: The one-bedroom home has a priceless view - or at least one worth £400,000 . Slapton Sands in Start Bay was considered the perfect place for U.S. military chiefs to train their men for the Normandy invasion because of its similarity to the layout of Utah Beach, one of the six landing points for Allied troops. The U.S. based 15,000 soldiers around the bay. While the vista from the house remains as breathtaking as it would have been in the mid-Forties, the interior of 1 The Turnpike is now strikingly modern. However, when the current owner, optician Ian Wills, bought the property in 2007, he says it looked as if it hadn’t been updated since it was occupied by American GIs. The upstairs was divided into two small bedrooms and the downstairs space included an old-fashioned kitchen-diner and cramped lounge. Ian set about converting the house into a ultra-modern living space. Upstairs there is now one large bedroom and state-of-the-art bathroom with underfloor heating, and an open-plan kitchen and lounge below. To cut running costs, Ian, 48, fitted an air-source heat pump, a system that absorbs heat from outside in summer and releases it inside in winter. Prime position: The home, far right, overlooks Start Bay in Devon . Outside, there is a balcony and a dining terrace – the perfect setting for summer suppers overlooking the sea. The property shares a large garden stretching down to the beach with the other houses in the terrace. Ian says: ‘About the only thing I didn’t change was the large window in the living area downstairs. I suppose people appreciate a good view whatever era they live in. 'It’s beautiful here on a sunny day but also spectacular when it’s stormy. There’s a lighthouse at one end of the bay, and when that springs into action it’s quite a dramatic sight.’ According to Julie Hill, of selling agents The Coastal House, the vista adds a substantial premium to the home’s value. ‘The view is rare even in this area,’ she says. ‘Many properties may boast coastal views but they are often just glimpses from one or two points, while 1 The Turnpike has an unrestricted panorama from its rooms and the garden. 'A view this good can add up to 100 per cent to the property’s value.’ Ian – who lives with his wife Clair in Chudleigh, Devon, an hour’s drive from Strete – bought the house as a romantic retreat. But having found they are unable to use it as much as they would like, the couple are selling and looking for a second property closer to home. For the past two years Ian has rented it out as a holiday home for £700 a week in high season and £410 a week in low season. Last year it yielded £14,000, and he sees it as a viable proposition for a buyer looking for a property to let for about 22 weeks of the year but which they might use themselves in rental ‘windows’. While the resort of Torcross at the other end of Start Bay is deserted in the winter, Strete remains fairly busy despite the rising number of wealthy second-homers attracted to this part of Devon. There’s a restaurant, a post office and pub in the village open all year round. Celebrity chef John Burton Race, who appeared in I’m A Celebrity .  .  . Get Me Out Of Here in 2007, lives in Strete, but visitors to the area may well be more interested in the exploits and endea-vours of the American troops based there in the run-up to D-Day. In April 1944, during a night-time rehearsal for D-Day, German E-boats torpedoed American landing craft in Start Bay, killing 750 troops – more casualties than were actually lost two months later at Utah Beach. On the beach at Torcross is a Sherman tank, salvaged from the sea as a memorial. thecoastalhouse.co.uk .",One-bedroom property overlooks Start Bay in Devon .

A RAF war hero lay dead and forgotten in his council flat for nine years before his body was thrown under a bush, an inquest heard. An unknown fraudster had been collecting Benjamin Benit's pension since he died and even after the body was dumped, Southwark Coroner's Court heard. When Benjamin Benit's remains were . eventually found wrapped up in a sheet in undergrowth he was still . wearing an England replica shirt from the 2002 World Cup and his left . hand was missing - it was later found in his old home. Detectives later arrested a man who initially gave his name as Benjamin Benit, but later said he was called Sidney Jackson,  but he was released without charge. Police are still in the dark as to who was claiming the dead man's pension and who callously chucked the war hero's body beneath a bush. A dog walker made the grisly discovery of Mr Benit's decomposed body in Lovelinch Close, Peckham, south London on August 10, last year. The inquest heard the body had only recently been moved from Mr Benit's flat. Sawdust from a nearby tree being cut was underneath the bag containing Mr Benit, showing he had been left there after August 5. The left hand was discovered by council officers when Mr Benit's home in Ilderton Road, Peckham was cleared out by council officers on August 23. Mr Benit was born in south London on 6 June 1925, and served in the RAF during World War II. He lived for a time in Bradford, where he had family, before returning to south London in the 1980s. Sad end: The body was found ditched beneath a shrub in Lovelinch Close, Peckham . Mr Benit was a regular customer in pubs around Old Kent Road and New Cross Road in south east London. He had missed a routine GP appointment in April 2002 and would have been 76 at the time of his death. 'From . all the available evidence, it follows that Benjamin Benit came by his . death in an unknown way in the year 2002,' said coroner Tony Badenoch. 'The police identified that the pension of Mr Benit had been accessed in the years since 2002. 'I note from the inquiries that pension cheques were cashed on August 15 and August 22. 'It is plain from all the material that it wasn't Benjamin Benit cashing his own pension but somebody else.' Gruesome: The coroner's court, pictured, heard about the grim end to Mr Benit's life . Detectives arrested pensioner Sidney Jackson and questioned him about the discovery of the body. Mr Badenoch said: 'He gave me some answers to some limited questions, and it was clear in his answers he told me he didn't know where Benjamin Benit had been living, and didn't know how he came to be in Lovelinch Close.' Mr Badenoch added: 'The body was severely decomposed and wrapped in a sheet, but still dressed.' 'Cleaners found what they later learned was a human left hand. 'The presence of the hand at Heversham House indicates that he had been at that address prior to August 5, 2011. 'The police then inquired how Mr Benit may have arrived in Lovelinch Close in a deceased and seriously decomposed state. 'It was blatantly obvious he had been placed there.' Mr Badenoch said he did not have enough information to conclude the specific cause of Mr Benit's death. They recorded an open verdict.","Body was discovered dumped under a bush in Peckham, south London .

A convicted murderer serving 40 years for the killing of a teenager has died after contracting a flesh-eating skin infection. Robert J. Turner, 32, was pronounced dead on Friday after he became infected with the bacterial infection formally known as necrotizing fasciitis. The results of an autopsy carried out over the weekend also showed that Turner had developed sepsis - a blood poisoning condition - his death was ruled . to be natural by the medical examiner's office . Turner, who was jailed in 1998, died in Chicago’s intensive care unit at the University of Illinois Medical Center . after being transferred there last . Wednesday, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Turner, . who has been based at the Dixon Correctional Center, was . also being treated for a number of other health conditions, including cirrhosis of . the liver, authorities said. According to the Chicago Tribune Turner was 18 when he and two other men were charged with the shooting of Derek Miles, also 18. Chicago police said Turner and his two accomplices confronted Mr . Miles and two companions on the street and demanded money. The victims could only muster $15 between them, but one of the three offered . to hand over valuables stored in Mr Miles' home. As the three burglars were stealing stereo equipment and . other items from the property, Mr Miles slipped away to retrieve a gun from another part of . the house. When Mr Miles returned and confronted the three men, police said, someone fired several shots, killing him. The nasty bacteria, more commonly called 'flesh-eating disease', rapidly causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat . Turner's death from necrotizing fasciitis is the latest in a string of rare flesh-eating bacteria cases reported in the U.S. this year. Last month Anthony Hills, 55, from Charleston, died from the aggressive infection and in July seven-year-old Tevita Alatini from Texas was also killed from the condition. Linda Snyder, a pastor from Sacramento, California, lost her life in June after being infected as did Michigan woman Crystal Spencer, 33.

The . nasty bacteria, more commonly called 'flesh-eating disease', rapidly . causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles . and fat. The . bug enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape and as the . bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off . blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. In May, new mother, Lana Kuykendall, . contracted necrotizing fasciitis in a hospital in upstate South . Carolina, just after delivering her twin babies. She underwent 20 surgical procedures to stop the aggressive bacteria spreading but managed to avoid having any limbs amputated.

Facing two years: Briton David Cecil is awaiting trial for allegedly staging a play without permission . The British producer of a play about being gay in Uganda is in jail pending his trial on charges that he had the work performed without official permission. David Cecil appeared in court yesterday charged with 'disobeying lawful orders' from the Uganda Media Council, which says he staged 'The River and the Mountain' in Uganda's capital last month despite orders to the contrary. Cecil's lawyer, Francis Onyango, said his client was not released on bail because his passport had been confiscated by the police. Cecil told The Associated Press that the play, whose main character is a gay businessman who is finally killed by his own employees, was performed eight times at little-known theaters in Kampala last month. The play, a first for Uganda, was praised by gay rights activists who said it was 'revolutionary' in the way it challenged common thinking about gays. But the play failed to make it to Uganda's national theatre, where producers rejected the script. Homosexuals are highly stigmatized in Uganda, where in 2010 a politician with the ruling party introduced a bill proposing the death penalty for what he called 'aggravated homosexuality'. Standing firm: Cecil claims he has been victimised because he has become the public face of the play, which has homosexual themes . The bill, which is currently being examined, has been condemned by some world leaders. Its author says he still believes it will be passed one day. Cecil, who faces two years in jail if convicted, said he was singled out for legal action because he had become the play's 'public face,' the man who printed posters and sent out invitations. The play was written by a British poetry student named Beau Hopkins, who has not been targeted by the police. The play takes a tragicomic view of the condition of homosexuals in Uganda, and its playwright and producers said this is the best way to look at things. The play's main character is a young businessman who loses friends after revealing his sexuality, then falls victim to machete-wielding colleagues who are stunned that 'a good man' can be gay. The gay character's mother stages an epic but losing battle to 'cure' him of his homosexuality, taking him to everyone from a Christian pastor to a private dancer. Despite the praise it won from campaigners, Cecil said at the play's premiere in Kampala that he did not believe the drama was 'a magic pill' against raging homophobia in the East African country.","David Cecil was denied bail after police confiscated his passport .

A man who was shot in the face by a homeowner defending his cottage from masked burglars was out on licence for a previous crime when the raid took place. Joshua O’Gorman, 27, pleaded guilty to burglary after admitting breaking into the secluded property near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in the early hours of September 2.

Mr Ferrie, 35, and his 43-year-old wife Tracey, who live at the cottage, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after O’Gorman and Mansell sought treatment from doctors ten miles away for their injuries.

O’Gorman, who appeared via videolink with a large gash to the right hand side of his face clearly visible, admitted burglary with intent to steal. Sukhy Singh, prosecuting, said O’Gorman’s girlfriend received a phone call at around 12.40am on the night of the raid from a friend of his 'screaming down the line for her to get an ambulance.' Mr Singh added: 'He said that her partner had been shot in the face, and that they were coming to her address.

Jay Z said that he never supported the Occupy Wall Street movement because he thought that the group had too many issues and not enough direction. The rapper's criticism of the political protests seems particularly striking considering he briefly sold t-shirts that played on the cause's name but didn't donate anything back to the organizers. In an interview with British author Zadie Smith for The New York Times, the rapper said that he never supported the wealth inequality protests in spite of his attempts to cash in on their popularity. Empty message: Though he changed the t-shirts so they read 'Occupy All Streets' many criticized Jay Z (right, seen with Occupy-supporter Russell Simmons, left) for not donating any of the profits back to the movement . He said that after producer Russell Simmons, who was an ardent Occupy-supporter, called him to enlist 'Hova' to make an appearance at the protest tent grounds, he rejected the offer on the grounds that he didn't know what the movement was about. 'I’m not going to a park and picnic, I have no idea what to do, I don’t know what the fight is about. What do we want, do you know?' he supposedly told Simmons at the time. During The Times interview, the rapper whose real name is Shawn Carter, said that once he got a sense of what the Occupy movement stood for, he took issue with the portion of their argument that derides the success of the wealthy '1 percenters'. 'I think all those things need to really declare themselves a bit more clearly. Because when you just say that ""the 1 per cent is that,"" that’s not true,' he said. 'Yeah, the 1 per cent that’s robbing people, and deceiving people, these fixed mortgages and all these things, and then taking their home away from them, that’s criminal, that’s bad. Not being an entrepreneur. This is free enterprise. This is what America is built on.' Considering Jay Z has worked his way up . from living in poverty and working as a drug dealer to accruing an . estimated personal wealth of $460million, it comes as no surprise that . he takes issue with slamming of the self-made-man. 99 problems: The rapper said that the protesters didn't specify their cause enough to make an impact . This is not the first run-in that Jay Z had with the movement as his clothing company Roc A Wear had to stop selling his t-shirts that played off the protest's name and changed it to read 'Occupy All Streets' once they received bad publicity after he admitted that there were no plans to donate any of the proceeds to the associated group. When they were sold, the cotton t-shirts were going for $22 each. At the time, TMZ spoke with an Occupy leader identified only as Grim who said: 'Jay-Z, as talented as he is, has the political sensibility of a hood rat and is a scrotum.' 'To attempt to profit off of the first important social moment of 50 years with an overpriced piece of cotton is an insult to the fight for economic civil rights known as #occupywallstreet.'","Jay Z criticized Occupy Wall Street because he took issue with their blasts against the wealthy .

Heath Eiland, from Austin, Texas, died in a skateboarding accident in May 2011 and his family decided to donate his organs so that others could find life despite the tragedy. A little more than a year after Heath's death, his parents, Stephen and Becky, met two of the six people who received organs from their son in an emotional encounter on Sunday to celebrate the life that continues on. Scroll down for video. Heart to heart: Becky Eiland weeps as she listens to her son's heart beating in Denise Miles, the recipient of his organ donation after his death in May 2011. Heath's father, Stephen (center in purple shirt), looks on . The sound of her son: Overcome with emotion, Becky Eiland places her head on Denise Miles' chest, to hear the heart that once beat inside her late son . The Eiland family arranged to meet the individuals that received life from Heath's organs at Saint Albert the Great Catholic Church in Austin, where their son had been baptized and received communion. But nothing could prepare Becky for the overwhelming experience of listening to the heart that once gave Heath life - now giving life to another, Denise Miles. At first Becky used a stethoscope to listen for Denise's heart beat and just hearing the repeating thumps caused the grieving mother to weep. Heath's father, Stephen, said his son was always wanting to help others . But as she listened, Becky wanted to hear more clearly - so she gently rested her head on Denise's chest. With tears rolling down the mother's eyes, she pondered the miracle of life being renewed in spite of her family's loss. 'It's hard to realize that his heart . grew in my belly at one time and now his heart is in someone else giving . them life. Sometimes its hard to imagine,' she told KTBC-TV, as family and friends were gathered to witness the meeting. Miles, who is from San Antonio, traveled to North Austin to meet the Eiland family for the first time. 'He reminds me every day I got something good going on. I'm here for my son, and I'm here for my family,' Miles told KVUE-TV about the precious gift she received from Heath. And Miles was only one of six people who was given a new chance at life from the organ donation. Christopher Mendez also met the Eilands on Sunday. He had received the boy's liver. Mendez said he had waited a year and three months to receive a liver transplant and is only alive today because of the gift. Life renewed: Denise Miles (left) received Heath Eiland's heart and Chris Mendez (right) received the teen's liver . 'It literally is a miracle that can change someone's life, not only to prolong it, but make it completely better as in my case,' he said.

'Our friend was skating on this . really big half pipe and he went face first into the ground,' a frantic . teenage witness told the police dispatcher last May to report the . accident. A heart comes home: Becky Eiland is in awe of the life that has been granted in spite of her family's loss . 'It's like 20 to 30 feet and he's just bleeding intensely.'

It may be 110 days left until Christmas, but according to Tesco it’s already here. Branches of the supermarket chain have already set up dedicated Christmas aisles across the nation. The first reports of Christmas chocolate boxes on sale in Tesco branches came on the 29th August with pictures appeared on Twitter. Since then the Twitter-sphere has been filled with angry posts about the premature holiday season advertisements. The Christmas aisles have now gone nationwide with reports of Tesco stores in Stafford, Scunthorpe, Hull and Newcastle already displaying chocolate boxes with tinsel and snowmen. Upset Tweeters posted pictures of decorated shop aisles pointing out that not only are we nearly two months away from Halloween, we still have Bonfire Night to look forward to before Christmas is upon us.

It's not even been halloween yet' The news of Tesco’s holiday marketing follows rival ASDA’s introduction of Santa’s Grotto’s last week. Although ASDA, unlike Tesco, say their introduction of Christmas cheer in August was only a temporary gimmick to offer financial help for parents worried about affording the holiday season. But parents complained that the appearance of Santa Clause had the completely opposite effect and made them more stressed about how to afford Christmas. Mother-of-three Sharon Spencer from Gravesend, Kent said: 'My children have already starting telling me what they want for Christmas, but are expecting it to come sooner rather than later. 'It puts a lot of pressure on us parents especially given the fact that money is tight at the best of times.'

The Advertising Standards Authority has also received complaints from people saying it is 'socially irresponsible' to promote Christmas so far in advance. A spokesman said: 'The ASA has been receiving a steady flurry of complaints from irritated and disenchanted consumers objecting to the premature appearance of Christmas advertisements. 'Those who have contacted us have been disappointed that, although the ASA accepts that some people will find it frustrating to see advertisements for Christmas appearing in the autumn, this is not an area that we regulate. Too soon: Twitter was aflutter with angry Tesco customers . Still September: Tweeters accused Tesco of mixing up their months . He added: 'Advertisers are able to choose when they wish to begin their seasonal advertisements and if potential customers are irritated by their decision, it is a risk that the advertiser must accept. 'However, the ASA has received more complaints on this issue this year than ever before, suggesting increasing consumer frustration.' He said that many complaints have involved worried shoppers saying Christmas advertisement intensify the financial pressures prolonging the amount of time that people find themselves economically burdened.

Mother-of-two Non Thomas - younger sister of former Welsh captain and British Lions winger Ieuan - jumped 150ft after texting her husband, an inquest heard earlier today.

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 10:07 EST, 7 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:10 EST, 7 September 2012 . Thousands of teachers have voted to go on strike over the 'erosion' of their pay and working conditions, it was announced today. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) said its ballot of members had shown that 82.5 per cent were in favour of walkouts, with a turnout of 27 per cent. Members also voted for industrial action short of strikes, with 91.6 per cent in favour, the union said. The result raises the threat of huge disruption to schools later this term. Threat: Thousands of teachers have voted to strike, unions revealed today . NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: 'The NUT is left with no . option but to take action to protect the well-being of our members and . restore their rights to do their job thoroughly and properly. 'Teachers are being undermined by a Government whose almost daily . criticisms and erosion of working conditions and pay, coming on top of . previous attacks on pensions, are unacceptable. This negative approach . to the profession has to stop. 'No other profession comes under such continual scrutiny and no other . profession has accountability systems based on so little trust. This is . bound to lower morale. It is time for Government to stop dictating to . teachers and address the problems which they are creating. It is time to . listen to the profession.' Anger: Michael Gove's Education department has said that the strike would be dangerous . The NUT, which has previously balloted members over changes to public sector pensions, has warned of joint strikes with the NASUWT teachers’ union . The NASUWT already has a mandate to take industrial action over the same issues. Today, the NUT said the two unions will be campaigning together to 'ensure that the onslaught of attacks on the teaching profession stops'. Further details of the campaign will be set out on Monday. Some 228,831 NUT members in state schools, academies and sixth-form colleges in England and Wales were balloted in total. The ballot result follows a warning by the leader of the UK’s biggest trade union of a fresh wave of co-ordinated strikes because of continuing anger over cuts to pay and pensions which was leading the country on a 'path to poverty'. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said there was a 'real likelihood' of more industrial action before the end of the year, following last November’s huge walkout by public sector workers over the Government’s controversial pension reforms. The pensions issue remains a 'festering sore' among workers in the health service, education and civil service and could erupt again in the coming months, he said. The annual TUC Congress is being held next week in Brighton, when activists are expected to press for industrial action. Mr McCluskey said public sector workers had endured a three-year pay freeze and face another two years without any increase, leading to growing numbers of low-paid people having to rely on food banks. 'That is scandalous. The attacks on public sector workers are unfair, and our members remain furious and angry. There is a real chance of coordinated industrial action, if not this winter, then early next year. 'There is a view that strikes are a waste of time, but I reject that. When people feel something is wrong, we have to protest. What else are we supposed to do? Shrug our shoulders and say taking action is not going to make any difference? When enough people march or take strike action, it has an impact.' Disruptive: There would be an impact on pupils all over the country if the strike goes ahead . NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: 'Congratulations to the NUT on a positive ballot result. 'This result is the reflection of two years of sustained assault from the Government which has been deeply damaging to teacher morale, as well as to recruitment and retention. 'On Monday the NASUWT will be setting out jointly with the NUT the next steps to defend teachers from attacks on their pay, pensions, workload, working conditions and jobs.' The Government has today called the threat of strikes damaging. 'We are very disappointed that a small minority of NUT members has voted this way. Industrial action would disrupt pupils' education, hugely inconvenience parents and will damage the profession's reputation in the eyes of the public,' a spokeswoman said. 'Parents and members of the public will struggle to understand why the NUT chose to ballot their members now about pay and working conditions when decisions about future pay arrangements have yet to be made.'","NUT say 82.5% were in favour of walkouts with a turnout of 27% .

A City trader accused of the biggest banking fraud in British corporate history appeared in court for the start of his trial. Kweku Adoboli, 32, allegedly gambled away £1.5bn on the stock markets while working for Swiss Bank UBS. He faces two counts of fraud and two counts of false accounting having been accused of losing the money as a result of a series of unauthorised trades. Adoboli sat in court on Monday morning, dressed in dark suit, white shirt, and red tie, as a jury panel was selected to try him over the coming eight weeks. Supported by friends and former-colleagues, the trader and son of a former Ghanaian official to the United Nations, looked relaxed as proceeding began. More than 40 potential jurors have been selected which will be whittled down to a panel of 16 from which 12 will be sworn. Addressing the court before jury selection began Mr Justice Keith said: ‘The case which is about to take place in this court is a fraud case. ‘The defendant, who is the man sitting in the dock behind the glass panels, worked as a trader for UBS and he is said to have lost over £2bn in the trades he made. ‘I mention that as the ballot to decide which of you will be serving on the jury for this case is about to take place and if you’ve worked for UBS at any time, or had direct dealings with UBS at any time, or if you’ve had a personal shareholding portfolio which includes shares in UBS at any time, or if any close relatives or friends have worked for, or had dealings with, or had shares in UBS it may not be appropriate for you to be on the jury in this case.’ He added that people would be exempted from the jury if they knew any of seven key witnesses identified by the prosecution and defence teams or Adoboli himself.

The first alleged offence is said to have taken place between October 2008 and June 2011, and the second between May 31 and September 17 last year. Prosecutors say Adoboli falsified records and created fictitious onward transactions in a bid to cover up the US$2.3bn risk he exposed the firm to.

In the cellphone footage the 20-year-old Tyler Dagley can be seen standing on his jet ski and not looking  in the direction he is traveling as he heads straight for Kristen Fonseca. Prosecutors say he was looking instead at his girlfriend, Natasha Ryan, who shot the video during their vacation in Hawaii in August. Dagley was released from prison this week after pleading  no contest to third degree negligent homicide was and ordered to serve of community service and pay Miss Fonseca's family $78,000.

As . he rammed the teen the collision caused her head to ricochet off the . steering column of her jet ski, throwing her into the water. Appearing in court on Thursday, Dagley said he was 'deeply sorry' as he pled no contest to third degree negligent homicide. The footage was shot by Natasha Ryan, who later claimed not to have seen the crash, deleting two videos from her cell phone . 'I am deeply sorry for what I have done,' he said. 'I never meant any harm and I pray every morning, noon and night for Kristen and her family.' Dagley was given a deferred jail sentence and ordered to serve a day of community service each month. He must also pay $78,138.06 in restitution to Fonseca's family. He left the courtroom with his parents, Alan and Ann, free to return to Australia, where he will have to set up probation arrangements in Australia. If he stays out of trouble for a year his U.S. record will be wiped clear. Ryan, 21, who is free on $500 bail, didn't attend her arraignment on Friday in Honolulu District Court. Because she's charged with a misdemeanor, she was allowed to waive her appearance. Her defense attorney, Walter Rodby, asked for a two-month continuance to prepare a possible plea bargain. She faces a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. Rodby said Ryan wants to enter a plea by mail, Rodby but declined to say whether she's returned to Australia, where she works as a dental hygienist. 'She wants to resolve this as quickly as she can,' even though there's no extradition between Australia and the United States for misdemeanors, he said. He said she acted out of fear. 'At the time the video was erased, Tyson was still in the hospital,' he said. 'His parents were on the way. I can tell you Natasha wasn't thinking straight. 'Natasha was here alone and I can tell you that she wasn't thinking . straight, and she thought in some ways that [deleting the videos] would be a good thing to do . for Tyson.'

The tragic teen's step-father Mario Cantone also spoke to ABC News of what he saw when the accident occurred. 'I then saw her head lunge forward, and hit the steering wheel. Kristen then fell forward, fell back and then fell into the water,' said Cantone. 'As far as I'm concerned that is not enough, that individual was operating the Jet Ski in a totally unsafe negligent manner,' her step-father, Mario Cantone, told Fox 40. Evangelina Fonseca told the court of her daily grief since the death of her 16-year-old child . Dagley, who suffered spinal injuries and a concussion in the crash, said he deeply regretted the accident and prayed Kristen would be OK before hearing of her death. 'Ever since I was in the hospital I prayed everyday, just to the family, and prayed that everything was going to be okay with the girl,' Dagley, who has now been in custody a week, said in court. Court documents say Dagley was heard at the scene saying, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe what I did. I'm so sorry.' Crash scene: The accident took place at Keehi . Boat Harbor, pictured, on the southern coast of Oahu about five miles . from Waikiki Beach . In a lawsuit filed on Monday in Honolulu's circuit court, the Fonseca family also names Aloha Jet Ski, the company that rented the watercrafts to the pair, as a defendant. The suit claims employees did nothing to prevent Dagley from driving recklessly. An employee who rented the jet ski to Fonseca's family and Dagley 'failed to give any instructions or warnings about driving at excessive speeds' before handing the man control, the papers state. Kristen was due to begin a work placement as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Vacaville on Wednesday, said her step-father, who, along with the rest of her family has returned home. 'She was excited about that. She just hated to see people in pain or hurt,' he said. Her classmates were struggling to come to terms with the loss of the bubbly teen. 'Just to know she’s not coming back, it’s still unreal for all of us,' Lyna Jackson, a friend of Kristen's, told Fox. Another friend, Halie Cunningham, said: 'It's really hard to deal with right now but we'll get through it. We all came out here to support her and her family and her mom.'

No changes: Aaqil Ahmed, the BBC's head of religion, has revealed atheists will not be invited onto Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme, despite calls by secular groups . Atheists will not be invited to speak on the BBC's religious programme, Thought for the Day, despite repeated calls by secular groups. The corporation's head of religion, Aaqil Ahmed, said he had reviewed Radio Four’s 'God slot’ in response to complaints that it was 'too religious'. But he also concluded the sermon featured on the Today programme was intended to provide a religious perspective on the news and should not include people of no faith. 'We should always analyse whether we should continue with something and in the last year or two we've had had some very detailed thoughts about this and we've decided to continue as was,"" revealed Mr Ahmed in an interview with The Telegraph. The decision is likely to upset campaigners, including the National Secular Society (NSS), which has for many years called on the BBC to change the Thought for the Day format. The programme features a religious leader speaking each morning from Monday to Saturday. The group argues that the slot contradicts the BBC's ethos of 'fairness, balance and a voice for everyone in the country.' On its website, the NSS stated: 'Only on this programme are such . controversial views allowed to pass unchallenged. 'We . argue that this contradicts everything that the BBC is supposed to . stand for: fairness, balance, a voice for everyone in the country and . for a wide range of views to be made available to all.' Mr Ahmed revealed his decision ahead of BBC Re:Think 2012, an inaugural two-day conference on religion and ethics in Britain, which will be hosted by the corporation in Salford this week. At the conference, the BBC will unveil new figures showing that the number of people in Britain who affiliate with a religion has dropped from 68 per cent in 1983 to 53 per cent last year. The survey also revealed a divide between the generations, with 77 per cent of people over 66 describing themselves as religious, compared to just 35 per cent among 18 to 25-year-olds.

'It's an exiting development and something that fills a . gaping hole in the understanding of religion in the world today.' On Wednesday, Mr Ahmed will take part in a debate with television executives called, 'Rethinking the God slot'. Sticking to tradition: The BBC has pledged to retain long-running religious programmes, such as Songs of Praise . He is expected to explain the BBC wants to appeal to a broad audience with its output of religious programmes - including atheists.

New Tory enforcer Andrew Mitchell has leapt to the defence of health minister Anna Soubry after backbenchers warned she was a 'train wreck waiting to happen'. Ms Soubry, promoted into government by David Cameron last week after less than two and half years as an MP, sparked a storm after branding the law on assisted suicide 'ridiculous'. She demanded greater 'honesty' about whether or not prosecutions would be brought against people who help relatives to die. Anna Soubry was appointed health minister in David Cameron's reshuffle but angered Tory MPs with remarks on assisted suicide . Her comments were publicly criticised by a number of Tory MPs. Nadine Dorries said Ms Soubry 'displayed a profound ignorance of the vulnerable position many of the disabled, elderly and chronically sick would find themselves in should she get her way'. Mark Pritchard warned of ‘an almighty parliamentary row’ if attempts were made to change the law. Now furious backbenchers have demanded Mr Mitchell, the new chief whip, rein Ms Soubry in. One Tory MP told him: ‘She is a train wreck waiting to happen.' The MP added later: 'Just a nightmare. I don’t know what the PM was thinking.’ A second MP said: ‘We have been told to bite our tongues but she is making the government look ridiculous.' However it is understood Mr Mitchell has rebuffed the rebels, telling them to give Ms Soubry 'a break and time to find her feet'. New chief whip Andrew Mitchell has told angry backbenchers to give Anna Soubry 'a break' Mr Mitchell - nicknamed 'Thrasher' - was promoted from International Development Secretary to take charge of the Whips' Office, at a time when Tory backbenchers are increasingly willing to rebel. The row illustrates the major headache caused by Mr Cameron’s first unforced reshuffle since becoming Prime Minister in 2010. Tory MPs elected in 2005 are furious at being overlooked for promotion, while Ms Soubry was among several who entered the Commons in 2010 to join ministerial ranks. The former barrister was one of six Tory women to join the government in response to complaints that Mr Cameron is failing to connect with female voters. Downing Street hope her no-nonsense style, honed as a presenter on ITV's This Morning in the 1980s, will resonate with the electorate. But the furore triggered by her remarks on assisted suicide over-shadowed ministers today unveiling a new £1.5m suicide prevention strategy. Ms Soubry said in an interview at the weekend: 'I think it’s ridiculous and . appalling that people have to go abroad to end their life instead of . being able to end their life at home. 'The . rules that we have about who we don’t prosecute allow things to happen . but there’s a good argument that we should be a bit more honest about . it.' Asked about Ms Soubry’s comments, Downing Street today hinted that Parliament could look again at the issue. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘There has obviously been some debate over the last week and the Nicholson family case has raised some very profound moral and ethical issues. ‘I think there are very strong arguments on both sides of the debate and it’s an issue that no doubt will be debated further. It’s an issue for Parliament to decide, it’s an issue of conscience too. 'This is one of those issues which is likely to be subject to further debate in the coming weeks and months.' It comes after locked-in syndrome . sufferer Tony Nicklinson died a week after he lost his legal bid to end . his life with a doctor’s help. Tony Nicklinson, a sufferer of locked-in syndrome, died a week after losing his legal battle to end his life with help from doctors . His widow, Jane, has said she would continue his fight to win a landmark ruling for the legal right to die. Mrs Nicklinson, whose lawyers say she has a 'compelling' case to be allowed to continue her husband's legal fight, welcomed Ms Soubry's willingness to 'stick her neck out' but said rights should not be restricted to the dying. Since new guidelines for prosecutors in assisted suicide cases were brought in in February 2010, anyone acting with compassion to help end the life of someone who has decided they cannot go on is unlikely to face criminal charges. Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister at the Department of Health, today backed reform of the law on assisted dying, while stressing that it is not something the government has policy on. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think there is a case for a debate. 'That's my personal view, it's nothing to do with my position as a minister in the Department of Health.'","Chief whip says Anna Soubry must 'find her feet'

It seems couples who gym together stay together – at least if you take the advice of these superfit grandparents. Bobby and Irene Simpson, who celebrated their 80th birthdays last month, have been going to the gym twice a week for 15 years. The couple live in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire and have been married for 58 years after falling in love at a cycling club aged 16. Staying fit: Bobby and Irene Simpson, both 80, have been regulars at the gym for 15 years . Bobby and Irene also go for a six-mile hike every Sunday, no matter the weather, and despite their old . age they have no intention of stopping. On top of their shared exercise regime, Bobby still finds the energy to play two full rounds of golf each week. Irene, who was at the gym for a two-hour workout today, said their age surprises people. ‘There are a few pensioners that regularly attend the gym but I don’t think any of them are quite our age. ‘We get out and get to know people we would never meet sitting around watching the television. ‘Staying . active is very important. We live at the top of a flight of stairs . which we can both still manage, though I don’t run up them any more. Fe-row-cious workout: Twice a week the couple get an early start and spend two hours at the gym doing cardio, weight lifting and rowing . Bobby met Irene as a member of the National Clarion Cycling Club in the late 1940s. Two years later the teenager was sent off on national service but upon his return in 1954 the couple got married. They had daughter Irene Wallace, now 53, and have two grandchildren. Bobby worked as a painter and decorator and then as a construction equipment assembly worker while Irene worked as a cleaner. When she retired 25 years ago, restlessness led to her joining the nearby gym and when Bobby retired ten years later he joined her. For the past five years they have been attending DW Fitness in Coatbridge and at 7am every Monday and Friday the couple head to the leisure centre. Bobby and Irene’s rigorous work-out includes up to four miles on the treadmill, half an hour on the rowing machine, up to an hour lifting weights and 15 minutes on an exercise bike. Heavy lifting: Bobby and Irene's gym programme includes some serious weight lifting, helping them keep fit and healthy - and able to take the stairs to their top-floor flat . Golden days: When Irene retired 25 years ago she felt she needed a new hobby and joined their local gym, and when Bobby retired ten years ago he joined her . Irene finishes her workout on the inflatable medicine ball and the pair head off for a well-earned rest in the steam and sauna rooms. Irene said: ‘Bobby was in the men’s racing team when I first met him. ‘I was in the women’s touring team but we still saw each other now and again, he was very dashing. ‘We had to stop cycling when we began to work and had a family but I started again when I retired. ‘We go in at 7am and work out for over two hours. I went four times a week up until a couple of years ago. ‘We like to keep fit. It gets you out and I look forward to it. There is a group of us that have moved around various gyms throughout the years so we know lots of people.’ Wed: Bobby and Irene Simpson on their wedding day in 1954 and, right, Irene aged 17 at her cycling club . Every Sunday the couple set out from their Coatbridge home for a three-mile walk to nearby Airdrie across the town’s park, no matter the weather. Irene said: 'When it snowed a couple of years ago we didn’t see a soul. It was just us in the park surrounded by blankets of white snow, it was beautiful.' Bobby said: ‘We carry out that walk without fail every Sunday. It doesn’t matter what the weather is like. ‘We change our routine every now and again to keep it interesting but we keep going. At our age it’s important to keep fit but we have always been active.’ Healthy love: Bobby and Irene met in the early forties at a local cycling club and married in 1954 .","Irene and Bobby Simpson have been going to their local gym for 15 years .

Furious parents and local councillors today blasted a school after it unveiled plans to build a ‘prison-style’ block for 12 of its most notorious troublemakers. Tudor Grange Academy in Worcester, West Midlands - which has the second highest expulsion rate in England - has applied to convert a disused office block into an ‘alternative education’ facility. In the first year the 720-pupil school was rebranded as an academy in 2009 to 2010, 15 students were permanently excluded. Troubled: Tudor Grange Academy in Worcester has the second highest expulsion rate in England . New plans: The former offices and pub which Tudor Grange Academy is planning on turning into an 'alternative education' centre for disruptive pupils . The academy is planning to build a ‘detention wing’ two miles from the main site, next to a Job Centre - where troublemakers will be taught the core subjects under strict conditions. Under the scheme, up to 12 pupils will be ‘rewarded’ for good behaviour with play time and be allowed to rejoin their classmates if they prove they are ‘rehabilitated’. But some parents are not happy with the plans. One, who did not want to be named, said: ‘The school is basically intending to build a prison block for troublemakers. That’s the long and short of it. ‘Instead of expelling kids, they will be taught in a separate wing of the school where they will be treated like inmates. New scheme: Under the plans, up to 12 pupils will be 'rewarded' for good behaviour with play time and be allowed to rejoin their classmates if they prove they are 'rehabilitated' Unimpressed: Some parents of children at Tudor Grange Academy, pictured, are not happy with the plans . ‘The school says no formal plans have been made but I have heard it from several teachers that the troublemakers will be rewarded for good behaviour with playtime. ‘The phrase “rehabilitated” has also been . used more than once which shows how the centre will be treated. It’s . abhorrent that school children, maybe as young as 11, will be treated . like criminals.’ 'It’s abhorrent that school children, maybe as young as 11, will be treated like criminals' Parent of child at Tudor Grange Academy . In a planning application submitted to Worcester City Council, the school said students would benefit from ‘focused intervention appropriate to their learning and social needs’. It was claimed this would make them less likely to be permanently excluded from the academy, as well as more employable later in life. The planning application states the new . premises will offer alternative education for pupils who have ‘struggled . to access or engage with mainstream lessons’. Two-mile distance: This map shows the proximity of Tudor Grange Academy (red) to the proposed detention block on Sansome Street in Worcester (green) At least two onsite teaching staff will give students classes in mathematics, English, art, information technology, cooking and life skills in small groups. Worcester City Council Labour councillor Alan Amos - who was the Conservative MP for Hexham in Northumberland between 1987 and 1992 - has raised concerns about the school’s plans. 'A school has to take the rough with the smooth and I’m concerned academies seem to take exceptional concern when they have pupils who need extra attention' Alan Amos, Worcester City Council Labour councillor . He said: ‘The trouble with academies is most really want to select their intake and that’s not possible. They need to accept their fair share of students across the ability and behaviour range. ‘As a former teacher, I can quite accept that sometimes one disruptive pupil can be a real nuisance to the whole school and you have to give them the best chance of life. ‘But a school has to take the rough with the smooth and I’m concerned academies seem to take exceptional concern when they have pupils who need extra attention.’ Tudor Grange Academy has not yet commented on the plans.","Tudor Grange Academy in Worcester has applied to convert office block .

A Texas woman who lost all four limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria has been approved for a double arm transplant at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital in what will be the first such procedure performed in the United States. Katy Hayes, 44, of Kingwood, will receive two new arms above the elbow and the former massage therapist said what she is most looking forward to is wearing her wedding ring again. Approved by the pioneering hospital for the transplant after undergoing a rigorous evaluation, the mother of three has battled through two years of rehabilitation as a result of losing all her limbs after giving birth to her third child in 2010. Scroll Down for Video . Katy Hayes spoke yesterday of her delight at being accepted by Brigham and Women's Hospital for a double arm transplant . 'I want my life back,' said Hayes to reporters at a press conference yesterday. 'I want to hold my children, I want to hug my husband, I want to cook dinner.' Hayes lost her arms and legs to a Group A Streptococcal infection that accelerated into flesh eating bacteria four days after giving birth to her third child. The former runner and yoga enthusiast had her arms amputated above the elbow, her legs above the knees and also lost her uterus and her large intestines as doctors battled to keep her alive. 'I never thought about how much a gift your hands are,' said Hayes yesterday at the press conference. 'When you don't have hands, you can't wear rings.' Katy Hayes and her husband Al after he made the decision to have her limbs amputated after his wife fell into a coma as she suffered the affects of a flesh eating bacteria . After raising $200,000 to cover living expenses, Hayes and her family moved from Texas in July to prepare for the surgery. 'She knew from day one she wanted arm transplants, not just prosthetics,' her brother-in-law Tom Phelps said to the Boston Herald. 'I’m just shocked and amazed that science has come this far. 'Katy is just a wonderful and fabulous person, and the tragedy of her getting the strep and how it ravaged her body was just a nightmare, but she’s so strong, she just pulled through. 'I’ll never forget when she woke up from the coma,' he recalled. 'She was like, ‘OK, let’s get to work,’ and we were all saying, ‘No, you need some down time.’ Before: Katy and Al Hayes with their children Amber and Jake (left) and the happy couple on their 10th wedding anniversary (right) Over the past two months Hayes has been undergoing psychological and physical screening at the hospital to determine her eligibility for the grueling surgery and long recovery. The transplant could give Hayes the ability to flex and extend her elbows and to lift herself out of a wheelchair. The level of function she will acquire, especially in her new hands, is uncertain, said Bohdan Pomahac, director of plastic surgery transplantation at the Brigham. All the previous above-the-elbow arm transplants similar to the procedure being planned for Hayes have been performed in Munich, Germany, by Dr. Christoph Hoehnke. Over the past two months Katy Hayes has undergone psychological and physical screening to see if the Boston hospital would allow her to have the complicated surgery .

Katy Hayes has said that what she is most looking forward to is wearing her wedding ring again . When the operation is carried out a team of 40 doctors will be involved said Dr. Pomhac. The double transplant will connect skin, muscle, bone and blood vessels in both arms. However, while doctors and experts do not doubt the ability of the surgical team at Brigham and Women's to attach arms onto Hayes, some are unsure whether full function will be restored. This is due to the fact that unlike internal organ transplants, hand and arm transplants are dependent on nerve regrowth to function normally said Dr. Vijay Gorantla, the administrative medical director of the Pittsburgh Reconstructive Transplant Program at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Nerves regrow at the speed of around one millimeter a day said Gorantla, who has been involved in previous Brigham and Women's surgical procedures. 'The recipient nerves have to regrow in the donor shell,' said Gorantla to ABC News. 'At this point, there's no technology to expedite that growth. 'Theoretically, there's a risk that these patients may not be functional or as functional as a distal hand transplant.'

Struggle: Despite fitted with limbs that help . her walk on her own, her struggle has been beyond difficult and she at . first wondered if it was worth it, before remembering her family . Katy Hayes relies on her family to help her around the house . However, yesterday Hayes paid tribute to the medical team at Brigham and Women's as she prepares to enter the next phase of quest to regain arms. 'These doctors are true rock stars. They’re giving so much hope to people, especially veterans, who are coming home with missing limbs,' she said. In May Hayes said the operation had given her renewed hope two years after doctors were forced to carry out the quadruple amputation to save her life. 'Before I was kind of dependent, laying there, not seeing really the kind of light at the end of the tunnel,' Hayes told WFAA. 'And now I've got that light, and I'm just charging ahead. Because it's within my reach. It's going to happen.' Hayes touched the heart of the nation in 2010 when it was revealed she had contracted a flesh eating bacteria while giving birth to daughter Arielle. Surgeons in Houston, Texas, had no choice but to amputate her arms and legs to save her life. After returning home Hayes, a massage therapist, struggled to come to terms with the loss of her limbs. She was fitted with prosthetic arms allowing her to hold her baby daughter for the first time. Hayes learned to cope with her new life with the help of her two other children, 18 year old daughter Amber and eight year old son, Jake.

Katy Hayes and her husband after she awoke from the amputation of her legs and arms in 2010 . The mother of three told WFAA TV that she was looking forward to the simple things with the arm transplant. 'Brushing my teeth; washing my face; wiping my own butt,' Hayes said. 'You know — things that everyone takes for granted.' Her husband, Al, said he is also dreaming of the smaller things. 'I think about things like feeling her arms around me, or feeling her touch my hair,' he said. 'I'm looking forward to her rediscovering the joy in simple touch.'

Joy: Her daughter Arielle is seen dancing beside . her mom on stage, another excitement for the mother who looks forward . to being able to hold and touch her family once again . Katy is a candidate for the double transplant as surgeons in Dallas left behind a significant amount of muscles and tendons when they carried out their operation two years ago.

Prison visit: Sheila Lee was on her way to see paedophile Anthony Lee, pictured, in jail when she veered into the path of another car in East Yorkshire . The 70-year-old woman driver at the centre of a horror crash that killed three people had been drinking before driving to visit her paedophile husband in prison, an inquest was told. Sheila Lee was almost twice the drink-drive limit in April when her Volvo car crossed lanes and went into the path of a Volkswagen Golf near Goole, East Yorkshire. The impact killed father Derek Sarkar, 46, and his son Ethan Sarkar, 14, while seriously injuring Derek’s wife Karen and their ten-year-old daughter Abbie - as well as killing Mrs Lee. Mrs Lee, who lived in Wigginton, near York, and was travelling to Doncaster Prison, had 141mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - far above the legal limit for driving at 80mg, the Hull inquest heard. A third-full bottle of pear wine with vodka was found in her car and remnants of the same coloured liquid were found in a glass. Mrs Lee also had a prescription sedative in her system. She was visiting husband Anthony Lee, 67, who was jailed last December for seven years and called a ‘monster’ by police for abusing two generations of the same family over 21 years. He indecently assaulted one victim repeatedly from the ages of 10 to 17, and then - more than a decade later - assaulted her daughter three times, when she was aged between five and 10. Dr Latifu Sanni, who carried out all three post-mortem examinations, told Hull Coroner’s Court of Mrs Lee: ‘The ethanol may have had a detrimental effect on cognitive functions and motor skills.' Tragic deaths: The impact of the crash killed father Derek Sarkar, 46, (left) and his son Ethan Sarkar, 14 (right) ‘The concentration of drugs was of a therapeutic range of use - but combined with the sedative, it may have increased the sedation affects.’ Ethan and Derek Sarkar, both from Birmingham, were sitting in the front of their Golf when the crash happened on a canal bridge. The family were planning to celebrate Abbie’s birthday. They were hoping to do so with Karen’s friend Jane. Bedding, drinks and Easter eggs for the party at Jane’s house in Selby, North Yorkshire, were all found near their car. Karen Sarkar said in a statement read out at the inquest: ‘I was sat in the back with Abbie and Derek and Ethan were in the front. We were singing, talking and having a laugh, like anyone would do. ‘I don’t recall the impact but I recall waking up and hearing Abbie screaming. I remember it took an age for them to get me out of the car - I was trapped by my legs.’ Survivors: The crash seriously injured Derek’s wife Karen (right) and their ten-year-old daughter Abbie (left) Karen spent three months in hospital in Leeds and had pins and plates put in her body. She has had several surgical procedures and will probably need more surgery in future. 'I remember we were singing, talking and having a laugh, like anyone would do. I don’t recall the impact but I recall waking up and hearing Abbie screaming. I remember it took an age for them to get me out of the car - I was trapped by my legs' Karen Sarkar . She said: ‘I’ve only recently been able to climb the stairs and sleep in my own bed. I have to rely on family and friends for help to do chores. ‘I’m currently seeking professional help as I have anxiety and panic and attacks and Abbie and I are both getting counselling. 'Abbie has a cradle halo brace on her head to protect her neck, so she can’t play with her friends like an average ten-year-old. I’ve lost my best friend in Derek and my beautiful baby boy Ethan. Nothing will ever bring them back.’ Mrs Lee had suffered from depression and anxiety and struggled with drinking problems in the past, the inquest on Tuesday heard. Crash scene: Ethan and Derek Sarkar, both from Birmingham, were sitting in the front of their Golf when the crash happened on a canal bridge. The family were planning to celebrate Abbie's birthday . Her daughter Karen, who was in a Ford Mondeo behind when the crash happened, said she did not believe Mrs Lee had been drinking before they set off from their home to Doncaster. The Sarkar family released a . statement, after the inquest.

I continued following her and, as the road had some bends, I kept seeing her ahead. ‘About 400 or 500 yards before the bridge I lost sight of her again. Then I saw a cloud of smoke on the bridge with a bit of burgundy on one side and some silver on the other. ‘The cloud cleared and I saw both vehicles - there was substantial damage and they were completely blocking the road.’ Coroner Geoffrey Saul said all three people had died from injuries sustained in the crash. He also made clear that the coroner’s court does not seek to prove any criminal or civil liability. He said: ‘I will simply say that Derek and Ethan were in a VW Golf, which was being driving appropriately, when for some reason the vehicle driven by Mrs Lee strayed from its own carriageway and into the oncoming carriageway. ‘There was no evidence of excessive speed but the incline of the bridge meant neither driver had an advanced view of the other car.' Coroner Saul returned a verdict of accidental death.","Sheila Lee was driving to visit 'monster' Anthony Lee in Doncaster Prison .

A wealthy former UBS banker and his wife were tied up at gunpoint during a terrifying home invasion at their $2.5m mansion whilst their three children were inside. Leonardo and Lana LeBrun were bound and gagged by an attacker who shot Mrs Lebrun in the stomach with a BB gun as he demanded their money. He also made off with a number of valuable paintings which hung in the living room including one by Cornelis Springer, a 19th century Dutch landscape artist. Stop thief: A wealthy former UBS banker and his wife were tied up and gagged at their Bedford Hills, New York home while the children were in the house . Mrs LeBrun managed to wriggle free and raise the alarm but just days later the attacker allegedly continued his assault by trying to extort $3m from them. He sent chilling letters saying he had followed their son home from school in the hope they would pay up - but he failed to follow through on his violent threats. Bartek Zajkowski, a contractor who once works on the Lebrun's 20-acre estate in Bedford Hills, New York, has now been arrested. The incident unfolded at the chateau-style property which has a long driveway setting it back from the road, landscaped grounds and several bedrooms. Mr LeBrun, 52, a former co-head of a UBS Bank mergers and acquisitions who now runs his own financial company, was smoking a cigarette near his garage when Zajkowski allegedly approached him with his gun out said: 'What valuables are inside?' Mr LeBrun replied that there were indeed some in the property along with gold and silver bullion. Caught: Bartek Zajkowski, a contractor who once worked for the Lebrun fled the scene with his loot and then tried to exhort a further $3million over the phone . Zajkowski then allegedly tied up his hands and feet and put duct tape over his mouth before stealing his wallet with credit cards inside and moving into the house. Inside were Mrs LeBrun, their children and the housekeeper. Zajkowski is said to have found Mrs LeBrun in her bedroom where he forced her to the ground. When she fought back he is said to have shot her in the stomach with his BB gun. Zajkowski then allegedly tied her up but Mrs LeBrun managed to wriggle free after he left and trigger the house alarm. The nightmare did not end there, however - and just as they were recovering the LeBruns received the first of three disturbing letters which demanded they pay $3m or their children would be harmed. One of the letters read: 'If you want your KIDS to to be SAFE YOU will PAY one million $ for each one. 3 kids = 3 million $. Wealthy: Mr LeBrun, 52, a former co-head of a UBS Bank mergers and acquisitions was smoking a cigarette near his garage when Zajkowski allegedly approached him with his gun . 'It can be 3 payments of 1 million each on the account you receive. 'Faster you pay all of it, faster I will be gone.' Another, designed to intimidate the family, read: 'Your boy comes from school at 4 pm he walk from the rode to the house all by him self with big black book bag wich is all most bigger then him. 'Looks like nice kid. Like I said to you I dont like mess with kids, but what need to be done has to be done.' In with one of the letters was an article from OK! Magazine about a six-year old child who had been kidnapped from her home in Tucson, Arizona. The LeBruns did not pay and instead went to the police. Nothing happened when the deadline set in the letters came and went. Zajkowski was caught after allegedly attempting another home invasion in Connecticut. He dropped his bag of kit which allowed detectives to match his fingerprints to the LeBrun crime. According to the criminal complaint, under questioning Zajkowski said he only wanted to steal Mr LeBrun's wallet when he carried out the attack. He also 'stated that he would think about it again first before doing it.'","Attacker made off with priceless art from their 20-acre estate .

A cross-dressing man was charged with murder of a woman who he gave an illegal butt implant. Morris Garner, who dresses like a woman and calls himself Tracey Lynn Garner, was charged with depraved-heart murder meaning he had a callous disregard for the life of his victim. Garner, 52, is charged with the death of Karima Gordon, who travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Morris' Jackson, Mississippi home to receive the treatment. Mississippi attorney general Jim Hood said that Garner had no training or official license to carry out that type of procedure. Charged: Morris Garner, a man who has undergone some gender reassignment surgeries and refers to himself as Tracey Lynn Garner, faces a life sentence for the death of one of his patients . Depraved heart: In keeping with Mississippi law, Garner was charged with depraved-heart murder meaning that the crime displays a lack of empathy for the victim . Ms Gordon, 37, died several days after the injection took place in late March 2011. Victim: Karima Gordon travelled from Atlanta to Jackson to receive the illegal treatment . It has yet to be determined whether or not the implant that Garner used was real or counterfeit silicone and authorities are urging any other patients who were treated by Garner to come forward. Garner appeared in court on Tuesday wearing the court-ordered yellow jumpsuit and had his hair up in a ponytail. While Garner said that he had undergone gender reassignment surgery, he was booked into court as a man. According to the Associated Press, Ms Gordon had previously served in the military but was working as an adult entertainer at the time of her death. Investigators determined that she got in touch with Garner, who worked as a floral and interior designer alongside his makeshift cosmetic business, through a person known only as Pebbles. Middleman: Ms Gordon got the name of Garner through a middleman who has not yet been identified by police aside from the name that Ms Gordon used to contact the person- which was Pebbles . Ms Gordon travelled to New York City to meet with Pebbles. During that meeting, Ms Gordon paid $200 to get a referral for Garner. Ms Gordon later travelled to Jackson with a friend to have the injection. She began feeling ill several hours into the car ride back to Atlanta and when she called Garner for advice, he told her to take some cough syrup. Deaths from illegal cosmetic procedures happen sporadically around the country. A New Jersey woman is currently charged with giving a fatal dose of silicone during a penile enhancement.","Morris Garner, who goes by the name Tracey Lynn Garner, gave a woman an illegal butt injection in March 2011 .

A plan to merge giant British defence firm BAE with a European rival ran into major trouble yesterday. MPs, shareholders and military experts said the £30billion deal with EADS might jeopardise jobs as well as national security. Politicians from both sides of the house called for hearings into the merger, which would create the largest arms firm in the world. Concerns: David Cummings, left, said the merger undervalued the defence firm and Admiral Lord West, right, warned that the ‘special relationship’ with the U.S. on military matters could come under threat . BAE-manufactured F-4 Phantom aircraft. Concerns have been raised over whether the company's reputation for cutting-edge technology could be under threat . The Government has a ‘golden share’ in BAE, which it can use to block the merger on a temporary basis. Tory MP Ben Wallace said ministers should use this option if the French and German governments do not give up their large ownership stakes in EADS. ‘It can’t be that a British company, that stands alone, is bought by a French and German government company,’ he said. ‘It’s naïve to think that the socialist French government won’t interfere with the company. When that happens, poor old British workers will get hammered.’ Fellow Tory Brian Binley said: ‘I can see in ten years’ time, when the crunch comes again as they always do, that it will be very easy for the Franco-German majority to say they’re going to gradually pull away and support their own industries.’ He also raised concerns about whether BAE’s reputation for cutting-edge technology could be under threat. Trident: The missile is a U.S.-UK project . ‘There’s a concern about the quality of their management,’ he said. ‘For all the efficiency that the Germans are supposed to bring, I’m not sure that has been reflected.’ The merger has raised fears that the new company, which will be 60 per cent owned by existing EADS shareholders, would shift skilled jobs overseas. David Cummings, of Standard Life, which has a large stake in BAE, said it was ‘not really clear to me as a shareholder why they’ve chosen to do the deal’. He said the merger undervalued the defence firm that was formed in 1999 by the combination of British Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems. One well-placed source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three of BAE’s top five shareholders, including its largest investor Invesco with 13 per cent of the company, were not in favour of the merger. That would be sufficient to block the deal, regardless of political intervention. Admiral Lord West, the former First Sea Lord, warned that the ‘special relationship’ with the US on military matters could come under threat. ‘I have concerns about American exchange of information with us,’ he said. ‘We are joined at the hips with the Americans on nuclear submarines. I just cannot see the Americans being happy about it.’ MPs on the defence select committee are expected to agree today that Defence Secretary Philip Hammond should be called to give evidence in a hearing, alongside BAE and EADS executives . Labour MP Thomas Docherty said: ‘It’s not a matter purely for the two companies, I hope the minister of defence will give evidence. The Government has got to have a view. ‘My understanding is that the Americans are not enthusiastic. It’s clear that there are a number of programmes where we share intellectual property, not least the nuclear deterrent.’ Gerald Howarth, a Tory defence minister until the reshuffle earlier this month, said the deal might have to be delayed given MPs’ doubts. ‘The future of BAE is critical to our economic and security interests,’ he said, adding that an October 10 deadline for the two firms to flesh out their proposal was unlikely to be met. ‘Parliament will want to be satisfied on some of these issues,’ he added. ‘Given that it goes to the heart of our national security, given that there are national sovereignty concerns at stake, we need to know some of the detail.’ BAE is building the new generation of Trident nuclear missiles and the Astute class nuclear-powered submarine, and has argued that key projects would be ‘ringfenced’ from the rest of the company. MPs for constituencies where some of BAE’s 35,000 UK employees work met yesterday to discuss how to prevent jobs being lost. EADS, which employs 17,000 in Britain, is understood to have argued that these jobs will be safer if it merges with BAE, because it would reverse plans to move factories that make wings for Airbus planes to Spain.","MPs, shareholders and military experts said the deal with EADS could jeopardise jobs as well as national security .

Stumbling block: BAE Systems and EADS have been told their planned mega . defence merger must include safeguards for Britain's Trident nuclear submarines . The future of Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent could prove a key stumbling block to the £31billion merger between BAE Systems and EADS. Ministry of Defence officials have told the firms their planned mega defence merger must include safeguards for the Trident nuclear submarines, which are made by BAE at its Barrow-in-Furness plant in Cumbria. The deal would create a rival to America’s Boeing and the merged company would have combined sales of £60billion and a global workforce of 220,000. Ministers are understood to have drawn up a series of ‘red line’ issues involving national security, any of which could derail the deal if agreement cannot be reached. Britain has a ‘golden share’ in BAE Systems, which the Government can use to block any takeover if politicians fear it won’t be in the national interest. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Commons business select committee, said he was ‘quite prepared’ to lead an investigation into the deal. Mr Bailey, Labour MP for West Bromwich West, said: ‘There are issues about protecting British industry and employment. ‘There is concern that management and commercial decisions would be taken at the European level rather than British level.’ EADS, whose subsidiaries include Airbus, has been troubled by continual interference from the French and German governments, which are large shareholders. Dismantling the company’s structure so this would not happen with a combined group is key to the deal winning approval here. Veteran City commentator David Buik, from spread betting firm Cantor Index said: ‘The UK government is clearly very concerned about the safety of Trident as a result of any merger between EADS and BAE Systems. This possible merger will remain a minefield of political and commercial concerns.’ It is thought a separate defence unit based in London and headed by BAE chief executive Ian King is being planned. The enlarged group is likely to be headed by EADS boss Tom Enders, a former German paratrooper. Hurdle: Both BAE and EADS have to win round the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Spain and the USA . Professor Keith Hayward, head of . research at the Royal Aeronautical Society, said the new company would . struggle to stand up to its largest shareholders. ‘The history of EADS has been a struggle to keep the German and French governments from telling Airbus what to do,’ he said. BAE . has focused recent expansion on the key US defence market. Professor . Hayward added: ‘The other issue is what the Americans will think about . the deal. They do not want anything like the French engaging in the . secrets of the American defence business. ‘Even ring-fencing the defence unit . under Ian King and based in the UK may not be enough. In my experience . governments look at the top line of who owns the company.’ Last . week Andrew Gollan, an analyst at broker Investec, urged BAE investors . to sell their shares, citing the complexities of the deal and the . ‘politically-sensitive issues’ involved. Last line of defence: One of Britain's Trident nuclear submarines HMS Vanguard . Veto: Britain has a 'golden share' in BAE Systems, which the Government . can use to block any takeover if politicians fear it won't be in the . national interest . But the combination would see defence-focused BAE Systems gain access to EADS’ commercial aviation business, dominated by Airbus. EADS hopes the merger will help it win more US defence work. Inevitably any deal of this size will  see some duplication, with job losses a likely consequence.Today more than 20 MPs with BAE factories in their constituencies will attend an emergency meeting at Westminster to decide on a course of action. The crisis talks were organised by Ben Wallace, Labour MP for Wyre and Preston North, who represents many workers employed by BAE at its Warton base in Lancashire. He called the deal ‘a takeover’ and warned it would lead to job cuts and would upset the UK’s defence relationship with the US. ‘What I don’t want to see is the French sweeping in and saying we will just get rid of the British workforce,’ he said.","Crisis talks over planned merger between BAE Systems and EADS .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 02:55 EST, 18 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:47 EST, 18 September 2012 . A mental health nurse who started a sexual relationship with a patient in her care before bombarding him with texts when he broke it off has been struck off. Deborah Boulton was said to have met a male patient and given him her mobile number, texted him messages saying 'I miss you' and 'I love you'. The band 6 nurse's actions fell 'seriously short of the conduct and standards expected of a nurse', a tribunal ruled, saying her ability to practice is impaired by reason of her misconduct. She was said to have met the man, known as Patient A, at the Sutherland Centre, for people with poor mental health, in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, in early 2009. Relationship: A tribunal heard Deborah Boulton had sex with one of her patients five times after meeting him at the Sutherland Centre in Stoke-on-Trent . A Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing was told Boulton gave the patient, who had previously been treated in hospital for an alleged overdose of diazepam and alcohol issues, her mobile number and texted him, telling him 'I miss you' and 'I love you'. During their relationship the pair had sex around five times: once in a hotel, once in his mother's house and approximately three times in Boulton's house. The patient claimed when he tried to finish the relationship Boulton bombarded him with calls and texts until he destroyed his mobile phone to avoid contact from her. The panel heard Boulton went on to take sick leave leading to her case load being re-allocated, which eventually resulted in claims of their relationship emerging. The allegations came to light when Patient A attended a counselling session in August, where he suggested to a counsellor that he had suffered a relapse because of the relationship, the hearing was told. Boulton was not present and not represented at the hearing in central London last week, but had denied the allegations. The NMC Competence and Conduct Committee panel struck Boulton off, finding she breached professional boundaries by giving Patient A her phone number and instructing him to call her, and also found she had failed to maintain accurate records and failed to create a care plan for him. The panel accepted evidence given by Patient A that Boulton left voicemail messages on his phone saying words to the effect of: 'If you do not come and see me now then you will never see me again', and 'I will end the relationship and you will be alone because you will never see me again'. It also found proved allegations that the Boulton took the patient to Frankie and Benny's in Newtown, Stoke-on-Trent, between May and June 2009, and to dinner with a friend in May 2009, and also that she bought him alcohol on two occasions. The panel also found proved claims that the couple had sex on around May 12, 2009, in Patient A's bedroom at his mother's house in Longton; and that they stayed overnight at the Holiday Inn Express in Stoke-on-Trent near Britannia Stadium, where they also slept together. It was also found proven that during May and/or June 2009, the pair had sex approximately three times at Boulton's home. Deciding whether the facts proved amounted to misconduct, the panel ruled Boulton's actions fell 'seriously short of the conduct and standards expected of a nurse and amounts to misconduct'. Striking her off, it said her failings were 'significant departures' from the standards expected. 'By placing her own needs above the needs of Patient A, Ms Boulton breached the fundamental tenets of the profession and the panel is of the view that to allow her to continue practising would fail to protect the public, and undermine public confidence in the profession and in the NMC as a regulatory body.' An 18-month Interim Suspension Order was also put in place to allow for the possibility of an appeal. If Boulton does not appeal within 28 days, then the order will be replaced by the striking-off order.","Deborah Boulton had sex with male mental health patient five times .

American Karin Joy Bowerman, 27, from Illinois, was sharing a room with her friend, Canadian-born Cathy Huynh, 26, at a guesthouse  in the coastal city of Nha Trang, when she fell ill and later died. While she was suffering from serious respiratory failure and her blood pressure had dropped to zero, she had no apparent injuries. Sudden death: Teacher Karin Joy Bowerman (left), 27, from the United States, quickly deteriorated after being admitted to hospital and died. Two days later, her friend Canadian-born Cathy Huynh, 26, (right) died. Two days later, Miss Huynh, who is of Vietnamese origin, was treated in the same hospital for . symptoms of shock and while under intensive care, reportedly suffered . several cardiac arrests and died. Initially it was suspected the women died of some kind of poisoning, possibly alcohol. But today, . a Nha Trang city police leader told Tuoi Tre newspaper: '(Miss . Bowerman) died from breathing failure, circulatory collapse due to brain . edema . (swelling caused by fluid). 'No toxic traces have been found in her blood and gastric fluids.' He said because no poison was found in her system, there was no grounds to open a criminal investigation. Guestroom: The friends were sharing a guestroom at the Sons and Daughters hostel, pictured . Before their trip to Vietnam, the two women had both taught English at a university in South Korea. Following Miss Bowerman and Miss Huynh's deaths on July 30 and August 2 respectively, forensic official Pham Xuan Thong said it was likely they had been poisoned. According to Vietnamese newspaper Tuoi Tre News, Miss Bowerman's family requested their daughter be cremated in Ho Chi Minh City and her ashes sent to their Illinois home. Miss Huynh’s family had refused to have an autopsy done on her as they say the two friends died in the same way so Miss Bowerman's autopsy would be enough. 'I’m deeply saddened and mournful,' Miss Huynh's mother, Huynh Thi Huong, said at the time. Having flown to Vietnam to complete the paperwork to bring her daughter’s . body home, she added: 'We would like to bring her body to . Canada for funeral because all my family members in Canada want to see . her for the last time.' The 57-year-old mother has blamed doctors and nurses for her daughter’s death.

Cathy's brother, Michael, who came to . support his mother said the family was struggling to come to terms with . the devastating news. 'All my family members are extremely saddened by her death,' he said. The family set up a website to raise . the $40,000 needed to fly Miss Huynh's body back to Canada. Tuoi Tre News reported that police investigating the mysterious deaths suggested the pair had died from drinking too much alcohol. The . unnamed forensic investigator from Khanh Hoa province's police . department told the newspaper he believed 'drinking too much wine' might . have led to the women's deaths. But Mrs Huong attacked the claims, insisting her daughter was not a big drinker. Beach destination: Nha Trang is well known for its pristine beaches and scuba diving and is fast becoming a popular destination for international tourists. Picturesque: Holidaymakers are attracted to the area for its natural beauty. 'She often drank a little at parties but she never consumed beer or wine during vacations,' she said. Dr Mai Dinh Trung, former head of . the Khanh Hoa Province General Hospital’s emergency service and . intensive care unit, also ruled out alcohol poisoning as the cause. An employee at the morgue . of the Khanh Hoa General Hospital told Tuoi Tre News that Cathy Huynh's . body had been sent in without any clothes on, just a piece of fabric pulled over her. When he was told that the victim’s . family want her to have clothes on, the staff member said that the . morgue would not supply clothes.

Grenadier Guardsman Daniel Crook was jailed and dismissed from military service after he stabbed 10-year-old Gulam Nhabi in the lower abdomen with a bayonet the morning after a heavy drinking session. Agreeing that the incident was ‘appalling’ the MoD has now accepted liability for the unexplained attack in Helmand province in 2010. The MoD has agreed to pay compensation to the family of a boy who was stabbed by a British soldier in Helmand province, Afghanistan (the picture is unrelated to the story) The MoD has yet to disclose the amount . to be paid but Gulam's father, Shah Zada, a 72-year-old farmhand and shopkeeper, has previously said he asked for . $40,000, approximately £25,500, in compensation at the time of the . incident but only received $800 (£510). The case was brought by a Birmingham law firm after British media reported on Crook’s court martial. Public Interest Lawyers’ Daniel Carey . told the Guardian that it was ‘regrettable that medical assistance and . adequate compensation were not provided earlier.’ On the evening before the incident . Crook drank ‘a considerable amount’ of vodka which had been sent to him . disguised as mineral water in a welfare parcel. He got so drunk that he had to be treated by medics and had his rifle confiscated as a safety measure then next morning. Disgraced: Daniel Crook was dismissed from the Grenadier Guards. Its headquarters are at Wellington Barracks in London . Armed with two grenades and a bayonet . he accompanied his unit as they left a checkpoint in the Nad-e-Ali . district of the Helmand Province to go on patrol. He came across two young Afghans riding . bikes - one of them was Ghulam who had been sent out by his father to . collect a bottle of yoghurt. According to prosecutors at the court martial, the child had pestered Crook for chocolate. In response, the soldier 'took hold of the boy's shoulder and stabbed him in the region of his kidneys with his bayonet'. Shah Zada, told the Guardian that Cook had ordered his son to stop 'but he was just a little child and he didn't . understand.' Afterwards, Crook caught up with the patrol and admitted he had stabbed the child. When questioned by military police he could not explain why he stabbed the boy. Shocking: The attack on the young Afghan boy took place in the Nad e Ali district of Afghanistan's Helmand Province . The court martial took place in June 2011, Crook was jailed for 18 months and dismissed from the army. Documents released by The Guardian on their datablog in March this year unveiled how military commanders do their utmost to prosecute any attacks upon civilians in Afghanistan. The Royal Military Police opened 126 . investigations of incidents in which British troops allegedly killed or injured Afghan civilians between January 2005 and March . 2012. Only eight of these led to prosecutions some of which were held in private summary hearings. A spokesman for the Ministry of . Defence said yesterday: ‘The MoD has accepted liability for this . appalling incident and appropriate compensation will be paid on receipt . of medical reports. ‘Incidents of this kind are extremely rare but any allegations of ill treatment are investigated thoroughly. ‘Protecting the Afghan civilian . population is one of the UK's top priorities.

Sailor's substantial sale: Princess Anne is usually known for her frugality but the keen sailor has invested £500,000 in a new yacht . She is normally known for her relative frugality and lack of flamboyance. But when it comes to her passion for sailing, it seems the Princess Royal is happy to splash out a bit. Princess Anne and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence are investing in a £500,000 bespoke Rustler 44 yacht. The princess has yet to reveal the name of the customised vessel, which is believed to have been built to exacting specifications and include twin cabins, a large galley and lounge areas. Her last yacht was called Blue Doublet after the horse that carried her to victory in the 1971 European Eventing Championship. It seems unlikely, though, that she will name the new vessel after her daughter Zara’s horse High Kingdom, which helped her to a silver medal during the Olympics. An associate of the princess revealed: ‘It will be called something very Scottish. Anne loves Scotland and wanted a name that celebrated a part of the world that she adores.’ Princess Anne and her husband spend most of their holidays cruising around Scotland, where their new yacht will be moored. The princess is also a keen pharologist – someone who studies lighthouses – and has vowed to see every one in the country. Her old yacht, a Rustler 36 which was on the market for more than eight months, was recently sold for a sum believed to be not far short of its £95,000 asking price. Royal's latest purchase: Princess Anne bought a new Rustler 44 yacht similar to this one but is yet to reveal the name of the customised vessel . In time for Olympic celebration: Anne and husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence will have the boat in time to celebrate daughter Zara Phillip's Olympic achievement, winning silver in in the equestrian team event . The Blue Doublet came with a bill of . sale signed by the couple and a brass plaque acknowledging that the . yacht was bought for the Princess Royal. It has a tiny galley kitchen . and a white plastic toilet. But it won’t be going far – its new . owners are believed to be planning to keep it near its old berth in . Ardfern, Argyll, where Princess Anne will moor her new vessel, as they . live in the area. Old yacht sold: Anne's old yacht Blue Doublet was on the market for eight months and was recently sold for almost the £95,000 asking price . The ‘beautifully cared for and . professionally maintained’ yacht  failed to attract a single bid in the . first six months after it went on sale. At the time, Simon Jones, a director . of Rustler Yachts, told the Daily Mail that Princess Anne’s teak yacht, . with blue velour furnishings, was a good investment. ‘It is in spectacular condition,’ he . said. ‘It has been on the market since the autumn but it was probably . put on at the wrong time of year. We have had a lot of interest – all . from the UK – but no offers yet. Moored nearby: Blue Doublet's new owners are planning to keep the boat near its old berth in Ardfern, Argyll, where Princess Anne will moor her new vessel . ‘But I am hopeful it will sell in the . next month or so. For a Rustler 36 of that age it is by far and away . the best we have had.’ Falmouth-based Rustler Yachts, which is also . building the new yacht, said in the sale advertisement: ‘The . world-famous R36 “Blue Doublet” owned by HRH The Princess Royal and Vice .

An man who has spent the last 13 years in jail remains locked up despite being declared innocent in 2010. Daniel Larsen, now 45, was sentenced to 27 years to life in 1999 for possessing a concealed weapon. After 11 years in a Californian jail, Larsen's conviction was overturned by a judge who said his constitutional rights had been violated. Support: Larsen's fiancee, Christina Combs is among those to have signed a petition campaigning for his release . Magistrate Judge Suzanne H. Segal said Larsen's attorney Edward Consiglio, who was disbarred in 2008, was incompetent and had failed to call key witnesses at trial. However the innocent man has been told he will spend at . least another year in jail because the California Attorney General's . office has appealed Segal's ruling and it will take a minimum of 12 . months for the appellate court to make a decision on the case. Larsen's fiancee, Christina Combs launched a campaign to get her future husband released, describing him as 'my life' from where he is 'stuck in legal limbo'. They met 15 years ago, scpr.com reported, but reconnected two years ago, becoming engaged with Larsen in prison. The distraught wife-to-be has gathered 90,000 signatures on her petition, among them NFL hopeful Bryan Banks, who was himself exonerated of rape charges in May after spending five years in prison. It was delivered to the Attorney General on Monday and has also been posted online. Betrothed: The couple met 15 years ago and reconnected two years ago, becoming engaged as Larsen served his sentence . Standing by her man: Ms Combs said she is convinced her fiance is innocent . Ms Combs is supported in her efforts by the California Innocence Project which campaigns for the release of wrongly imprisoned citizens. 'Daniel's case is a tragic one, especially considering how easily it could have been avoided,' said project director Justin Brooks. 'His case highlights how important it is for defendants to get good, competent attorneys who conduct a thorough investigation. He is another innocent victim of a flawed justice system.' It was the project that first filed the petition in 2008 that led to the conviction being revoked but there is still a long way to go. Co-director Jan Stiglitz expressed disgust that Larsen is 'rotting in jail' as those legal battles are fought. Ms Combs told ABC LA: 'I have no doubts about his innocence. He has a very credible witness, the chief of police. He's innocent and he needs to be released. 'It's time for the Happily Ever After we deserve!' Wrongly convicted: Larsen was locked up in 1999 and will spend at least another year in prison . Larsen was imprisoned in 1999, after police arrested him outside Gold Apple Bar in LA. Officers were responding after gunshots were fired and said they saw Larsen reach into the waistband of his pants, pull out a metal object and throw it underneath a nearby car. After searching Larsen and the nearby area, they found a six-inch, double-edged knife underneath the car. Larsen was arrested and eventually convicted of being an ex-felon in possession of a knife. He already had two burglary convictions to his name. Under California's three strikes law a person convicted of three or more serious felonies automatically receives a life sentence. At two strikes the sentence for any new felony conviction is . twice the term otherwise required under law. The law was passed in 1994 after a spate of high profile murders were committed by ex-felons. Repeat offenders are the most difficult of criminal offenders for criminal justice systems to manage. Under California's three strikes law a person convicted of three or more serious felonies automatically receives a life sentence. At two strikes the sentence for any new felony conviction is . twice the term otherwise required under law. Nine witnesses pointed the finger at another man, William Hewitt, who they said had been in possession of the knife, not Larsen. Consiglio failed to present any of them at trial. As a result no one took the stand in defence of his client. It wasn't until 2009 that three of the witnesses, including the Chief of Police and his wife, testified that Larsen was innocent. Upon hearing the testimonies Judge Segal reversed Larsen's conviction. 'Had the jury been able to consider [the McNutts' testimony], no reasonable juror would have found [Larsen] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,' she said. Consiglio's lack of investigation was 'absurd', she claimed, adding there was 'no question' that 'counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable'.","A judge overturned Daniel Larsen's conviction in 2010 for possessing a concealed weapon .

Tracy Morton leaves Reading Employment Tribunal Centre where she is suing West London Mental Health Trust for unfair dismissal from her job as a counsellor at Broadmoor Top Security Psychiatric Hospital . A counsellor wrote to one of Britain's most dangerous men telling him how special he was before ordering him 'now eat this card', an employment tribunal has heard. Tracy Morton would enter patients' rooms alone on a ward for the most high-risk and dangerous patients at top-security Broadmoor psychiatric hospital. It was alleged that the trained martial artist, who worked as a clinical team leader, tolerated inappropriate conduct which culminated in a therapy assistant friend resigning amid accusations of a sexual relationship with two patients. Morton was sacked after handing a . junior colleague a packet of sweets, to give to a patient being held . under section in the top security wing, along with the bizarre card - . which asked him to dispose of it by eating it, the tribunal heard. The . card told the unnamed man he was 'very special'. Morton was also said to have given patients food and sworn . openly on the ward, the employment judge . was told. She is . suing the hospital's management - West London Mental Health Trust - for . unfair dismissal over the allegations of serious security breaches. Michael Humphrey, Broadmoor's director of security, said: 'We reviewed the card that Ms Morton had given to a patient. 'The wording was akin to terms of endearment as if Ms Morton was trying to tell the patient that he was very special to her. 'This . was completely at odds with a professional relationship and Ms Morton's . remark ""now eat this card"" was sending a message to the patient that . she knew that this action completely flouted trust policy and she was . seeking the patient's collusion in this regard. 'The wording of the card indicated that Morton had a special relationship with the patient which was of a personal nature. 'From . other cases I've seen actions of this kind can lead to boundary . violations of a more serious nature that can include criminal offences.' The . security breach came just months after a friend and colleague who she . had closely mentored resigned when a letter she had penned for another . inmate was handed to staff. The note revealed the therapy . assistant, who has not been named, had an inappropriate relationship . with the detained man, who accused her of having sex with him and . another patient. In the . bombshell revelation he demanded an HIV test, fearing the sexual . indiscretion could have led to him contracting the disease. The relationship had been developing . since Christmas 2009 under Ms Morton's nose while she was supposed to be . mentoring her, and the pair had repeated conversations about stopping . contact between them. Broadmoor, the high-security psychiatric hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire, houses some of Britain's most dangerous patients . However, the carer was only moved in the summer of 2010 when another post became available on a different ward. At the time the patient broke his . silence there were said to be two copies of the note, one was held by . managers while the other was thought to have been eaten by the recipient . in order to dispose of it. The . instruction to 'eat this card' contained in Morton's own note was said . to be a sign that she knew her actions were wrong and wanted him to . dispose of the evidence. During disciplinary interviews she . admitted what she did was wrong but explained it by saying she was upset . about the suspension of her manager, who had faced internal action over . failures relating to the sex scandal. 'The patients within the unit consist of . mostly young men who suffer from serious personality disorders who as a . result of their disorders have committed very serious crimes such as . murder, rape or paedophilia.' Angela Dolan, Broadmoor . Morton justified venturing into bedrooms alone up to four times by saying she was a skilled martial artist and could handle herself, the tribunal, sitting in Reading, Berkshire, heard. Among the barrage of allegations levelled at her was the claim she regularly swore back at inmates when they used four letter words towards her. Angela Dolan, the hospital's service director for personality disorder patients, said: 'The language used by Ms Morton in the card was particularly concerning. 'Ms Morton had stated in the card that she treasured working with the particular patient. 'We considered that this language was highly emotive and completely inappropriate within the confines of a professional relationship in the high secure hospital. 'This in itself was a clear breach of professional boundaries between Ms Morton and the patient which, given Ms Morton's seniority, was very concerning.' She added: 'Taking all of the allegations into consideration we considered that Ms Morton's actions had amounted to gross misconduct and that she should have been summarily dismissed from her post.' The tribunal heard that while there were allegations of an unprofessional relationship there were no claims of a sexual relationship between them. However, Ms Dolan described how the scheming and manipulative patients at the Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder Unit would groom staff. She said: 'The DSPD Unit, which is located in the Paddock Centre, houses some of the most seriously disordered and dangerous patients within Broadmoor Hospital. 'This was one of two NHS units within the UK treating this category of patient. 'The DSPD Unit was set up in 2000 as part of a national pilot, as a result of the government's manifesto dealing with public protection issues. 'Patients within the unit are categorised as people who pose a high risk of causing physical or psychological harm to others. 'The patients within the unit consist of mostly young men who suffer from serious personality disorders who as a result of their disorders have committed very serious crimes such as murder, rape or paedophilia.' She added: 'These individuals are highly manipulative and often seek out vulnerable members of staff and attempt to groom them for inappropriate relationships and obtain prohibited items to be brought into the hospital. 'The risk to safety presented by these patients is therefore often more likely psychological rather than physical.' Morton, from Reading, Berkshire, was fired after a disciplinary hearing on May 26 last year. The hearing continues. Britain's Hannibal, Robert Maudsley, who killed four people, one of whom he ate. He was a patient at Broadmoor . Broadmoor was the first custom-built asylum to house criminal lunatics, constructed in 1863. The idea was triggered by the case of James Hadfield, an ex-soldier who, in 1800, while watching a play at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, levelled his pistol at King George III and fired at him. He missed, but his subsequent acquittal by reason of insanity caused such public uproar that Parliament speedily passed the Criminal Lunatics Act to provide for the indefinite detention of the insane, and a new institution was born, 'intended for the reception, safe custody and treatment of persons who had committed crimes while actually insane or who became insane while undergoing sentences of punishment'. The possible causes of insanity were listed as 'anxiety, epilepsy, intemperance, vice, poverty, religious excitement, fright and exposure to hot climates'. The 53-acre high-security psychiatric hospital, which now holds roughly 230 men, initially had room for 400 men and 100 women. Among the first inmates were two would-be assassins of Queen Victoria, Edward Oxford and Roderick McLean. Edward Oxford was 18 and serving beer in a pub when in 1840 he tried to shoot the Queen and Prince Albert as they rode out on Constitution Hill. Ian Brady (pictured) and Myra Hindley murdered five children between 1963 and 1965 . Both bullets missed, and they were later found to be blanks. Roderick McLean was judged insane after he fired a revolver point-blank at the Queen - and missed - in 1882 as she left Windsor train station. Other notable past inmates have included notorious child killer John Straffen, the UK's longest-serving prisoner, who died in jail, 55 years after being convicted of murdering a schoolgirl. The Kray twins, Moors murderer Ian Brady and the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, have all been held at the hospital. Perhaps the most notorious is one who few of Broadmoor's residents ever saw, the original Hannibal Lecter. Robert Maudsley was in Broadmoor for three years in the Seventies after he killed four people, one of whom he ate. He was nicknamed Spoons after Maudsley and another psychopath took a Broadmoor patient, a paedophile, and barricaded themselves into a cell with him. The paedophile was tortured for nine hours before Maudsley garrotted him and held up his body so that the staff could see him through the spy hatch. When the staff were let in, they found that the man's skull had been cracked open like a boiled egg, with part of the brain missing and spoon hanging out of the cranium.","Tracy Morton entered patients' rooms alone on ward for high-risk patients .

A wealthy businesswoman who was beaten to death then set on fire may have gone on a secret late night date before she was killed. Diana Lee, 54, appeared to take a 42 minute mystery detour in her car after leaving friends in a restaurant to return to her luxury home. The following morning her badly burnt body was discovered in the garage of her £500,000 house in the village of Cranage, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, after a postman saw the building had been engulfed by fire. Mystery: Diana Lee, 54, whose burnt out body was discovered in her home in East Cheshire. Cheshire Police have released this e-fit of a man detectives want to trace in connection with the killing of a woman found dead in her home by firefighters . Today Cheshire Police issued an e-fit of . an 'athletic but weathered' hooded man they wanted to question . over the killing. He was seen attempting to torch Mrs Lee’s car and . was seen riding away on Mrs Lee’s pedal cycle before that too was dumped . and he escaped on foot across fields.

The victim’s house had no signs of a break in - yet had also been set on fire in a bid to destroy evidence. Killed: It emerged Mrs Lee had suffered fatal head injuries following a savage beating at her up market cattery at a large gated property, flanked by high hedges and trees in the heart of the countryside . Det Supt Martin Cleworth of Cheshire . Police said today: 'Detectives believe the person responsible may have . been a friend, an associate, or in some way knew Diana as there was no . sign of forced entry at her house. 'We also believe that the person responsible is likely to have knowledge of the area swell and most likely will have been acting differently since her death. 'Detectives are keen to reiterate that we do have ways to forensically eliminate people from this investigation and would appeal for anyone with information to come forward so we can piece this complex jigsaw together.' Mrs Lee had operated the Parklands Cattery, a former hospital unit, with her partner Neville Barrett after buying the property in 2008. Two years ago they opened the cattery . where cats were accommodated in a lap of luxury, including separate . rooms and their own television and stereos. Discovered: The dead woman¿s silver Vauxhall Corsa was later found ten miles away on a country lane the nearby village of Mobberley after attempts were made to set it on fire too . The . pair featured in a local newspaper profile, where they talked of how . cats were 'pampered' in the cattery for just £9 a night. But the couple split up after a series of rows and 48-year old Mr Barrett moved to an address in Hale. It . was also believed Mrs Lee was known to police after she had contacted . them three years earlier complaining about her safety. Neighbours . reported that the couple had been having unspecified 'problems' in . recent times. On the night before she was found . dead on August 9, Mrs Lee - described by police as 'shy but sociable' had gone to a restaurant with friends in Knutsford for dinner. She . left at 10.15pm, but her Corsa was caught on a police CCTV camera at . 10.35pm heading North out of Knutsford towards the Altrincham area . instead of South towards her home in Cranage.

Police . said the Corsa car was then seen leaving Mrs Lee’s home at 10am the . following morning shortly before her body was found. At 10.30am the car . ended up at Mobberley where a man was spotted trying to set it alight. After . being disturbed by a witness he rode off on Mrs Lee’s blue womens pedal . cycle. He abandoned the bike in Pepper Street some 600 yards away and . then left the area on foot across the fields. Mr Cleworth said: 'Diana had joined friends for dinner in Knutsford and she was described as being happy and sociable during the evening and raised no concerns amongst her friends. 'What is of interest to us is that Diana was in fact heading away from her home, north out of Knutsford after she left the restaurant. Some 42 minutes later at 11.17pm, Diana was heading back towards her home address in Cranage, south on the A50. 'We consider Diana’s final movements as significant - we do not know where she went between these times or who she may have met.

Police arrested Mr Barrett shortly after the discovered of Mrs Lee’s body but he was freed on bail pending further inquiries. None of the 12 cats at the premises were injured in the blaze and were transferred to another cattery.","The body of Diana Lee, 54, was discovered in the garage of her £500,000 house in the village of Cranage, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire .

Apple stores have long been regarded as modern bastions of technology staffed with sharp young problem-solvers eager to help a customer in need, but according to a shocking new exposé, all is not as it seems. A tell-all article has blown the lid off the dirty secrets of one Apple store at the NorthPark Shopping Center in Dallas, Texas. Among the allegations was a manager trading heavily discounted Apple products to a plastic surgeon in return for a stomach-stapling procedure. Rotten Appley: The NorthPark Apple store in Dallas has been identified as the location in an explosive expose . According to Gizmodo magazine, which interviewed two former so-called 'Genius' Apple employees, identified as 'Jake' and 'Ronald', behind-the-scenes at the store was a hotbed of corruption, drunkenness and out-of-control antics. The former employees said that the regional corporate manager ran the store as if it was her personal playground. ‘She was notorious for pulling favors for businesses in the community who didn't want to play by Apple's rules,’ Jake told Gizmodo. ‘She made quid pro quo an art.’ Eventually, the female manager was ousted . for reportedly ‘unfair hiring practices,’ playing favorites, and ' questionable activities surrounding use of store services'. Dark side: Former members of the Genius squad revealed that if customers were rude to them, they would get back at them by breaking their hardware . But management were not the only ones breaking the rules. Ronald admitted that he and his co-workers on the Genius squad would shamelessly exploit Apple’s once lax return and exchange policy to get new phones whenever they pleased by making false transactions. Sales Queen: Ex-workers claimed that one regional manager sold computers at a sharp discounter to a plastic surgeon in exchange for a stomach stapling procedure . ‘It bends my brain to know that, statistically speaking, it's harder to get a job at the Apple Store than it is to get into some Ivy League schools,’ Jake said. ‘Yet somehow they're staffed by some of the most inept people this side of mastering the ability to speak.’ Sometimes they would purposely smash their iPhones at alcohol-fueled parties just to see how many replacements they could squeeze out of the Apple stockroom. But it was not just the off-site parties where the booze flowed freely. ‘It's not uncommon for the Genius team to be drunk,’ Jake noted, adding that Apple employees working the night shift at a call center in a nearby town would routinely do cocaine on the job. Beside exploiting their company’s policies to score free hardware and working while inebriated, Jake and Ronald have revealed that members of the Genius squad would get back at particularly rude or annoying costumers by destroying their devices, simply because they were being 'a*******'. ‘Ive used someone else's hard drive as a skateboard cause he told the store I smelled,’ Ronald said in a text message. And there was little the customers could do about their damaged property because the employees would give them a form to sign according to which they were not responsible for data loss. Sign of contempt: The workers at the Dallas store created a shrine to the whining customers in a back room . In a supreme expression of contempt for Apple clientele, some of the Geniuses at the NorthPark location even built a shrine in a back room to whining customers. Gizmodo has reported that since releasing the expose, several other former workers of the Dallas store, identified by the Dallas Morning News, have come forward to corroborate the claims made by Jake and Ronald, who are no longer employed by Apple. Others, however, were quick to point out that the examples of irresponsible behavior cited in the article were an exception to the rule, and that most Apple employees love their job and treat their customers with respect.","Store at NorthPark shopping center in Dallas, Texas .

When mother-of-five Alice Winstone was told she could not have more children for health reasons, she remained determined to fill her home with babies. And the maternal 39-year-old is so desperate to care for infants she has spent thousands buying 50 lifelike baby dolls which take up her entire house. Mrs Winstone has spent seven years and over £12,000 filling her home with the scarily lifelike vinyl 'Reborn Dolls', even though three of her five real children still share the same house. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Maternal instincts: Alice Winstone cares for one of the 50 fake babies which fill her home in Cardigan, Mid Wales . Mother duties: Mrs Winstone, who is separated from her husband due to her obsession, changes the clothes of one of her 'children' Her obsession with the fake babies, which cost up to £1,200 each, sees her spend £50 a month and has forced her long-suffering husband Chris to move out of their maisonette home in Cardigan, Mid Wales. Mrs Winstone had bought her first fake baby, a £180 doll called Emily, after seeing her on the back of a magazine and 'falling head over heels in love with her'. She went on to buy 13 more in quick succession, and admitted that soon after she 'couldn't stop.' She said that despite the misgivings of husband Chris, she was 'astonished to feel such a close bond to a doll'. Mrs Winstone had been told after her becoming pregnant with youngest daughter Jessica, now 12, that she had a blood disorder which would make another pregnancy unsafe. Lifelike: The 'Reborn Doll's are made from a vinyl material and can cost up to £1,200 each . Care and attention: Mrs Winstone shows the rack of outfits she has bought for her fake children . Changing time: Mrs Winstone bought her first doll around seven years ago after 'falling head over heels in love with her' Her medical issue also means she does not work, instead caring 24 hours a day for the 50 fake children she has collected since. She changes, washes, sleeps with and 'feeds' her enormous brood of vinyl children - and even takes her favourites out for day trips in the car. She readily admits she preferred caring for her dolls to having sex with her husband, who moved out of their home five years ago due to her growing army of pretend children. Mrs Winstone said: 'I tried taking in kittens, and even fostering children but I couldn't bear the part where I had to say goodbye. 'I began looking after the dolls like I would my own babies - they are so life-like and I feel such a close bond to them. 'It's the best of both worlds as well - I get to dress them up, do their hair and wash their clothes without the endless dirty nappies and sleepless nights!' Mrs Winstone became very protective over her dolls and worried about her children being near them, or the cat sitting on them if she wasn't around to keep an eye on them. 'Reborn dolls' are lovingly made by specialist artists who painstakingly create 'lifelike' vinyl dolls worth thousands of pounds. The popularity of reborn dolls emerged in the early 90s and is now an industry in its own right. Makers typically take a vinyl doll and add extra layers of paint and detail for a more realistic look. Artists can add mottled paint effects and veins for the look of a newborn, and often use high quality mohair for the baby's head. The arms and head of a reborn doll are also usually weighted with sand or another substance to give a more lifelike feel. Buyers can request bespoke 'features' on the doll, such as a heartbeat, magnetic dummy or magnetic hair ribbon. Some reborn dolls are made so they can be 'fed' a fake form of milk, while others have mechanisms which make their chest rise and fall, replicating breathing. She moved the dolls to her bedroom, and bought cots for them to sleep in. Eventually Chris moved out as he couldn't cope with her love for the dolls any longer. She said: 'Chris didn't understand why I treated my dolls like real babies - he just didn't get it. 'I tried telling him how happy they make me but he just thought it was a stupid obsession. 'They soon started to affect our sex life as I would want some of them to come to bed with us, but Chris refused. 'We were arguing about other things in our relationship, but the dolls really didn't help - he said they freaked him out because they looked so real.' 'I wouldn't have given up my dolls for Chris - we come as a package. I like them close to me, and I'm never far away from them for long. 'After Chris left, I down-sized my double bed to a single and turned our room into a nursery. I didn't need the extra space and it meant there was more room for my dolls and their stuff.' Mrs Winstone insisted that, while she 'does love her children more', she would still not give up her dolls for anything. Attached: The mother-of-five says she now spends all her time with her 50 fake babies, as they 'come as a package' Realistic: Mrs Winstone's most expensive Reborn Doll, a 'boy' called Rhys, cost her £1,200 . Mrs Winstone regularly takes her pretend brood out for day trips near her home in Cardigan, Mid Wales . Her estranged husband Chris still visits their house to visit the couple's real children - Jade, 22, Ben, 21, Kyle, 17, Charlie, 15, and Jessica, 12 - as their youngest three still live under the same roof as the 50 fake babies. The mother-of-five was told she could not become pregnant again after her fifth baby due to blood disorder . She added: 'Of course, I love my kids more – I know these babies aren’t real. I’m not mental.' Despite claiming this, the mother of five has admitted to dressing her favourite doll Rhys (who cost £1,200) up in Ugg boots and taking him on day trips to the zoo. Mrs Winstone said: 'I've spent thousands on my dolls - but I also go to doll fairs and swap them for others when I've had them a while. 'Rhys is my favourite, I like him to sleep with me every night. 'I recently took him to Chester Zoo - loads of people came up to me and told me how cute he is, and they couldn't believe it when I told them he was a reborn doll and not a baby. 'I buy him Next clothes and UGG boots as I want him to look nice.' Mrs Wintstone's reborns are so realistic, she was once stopped by police when she had four of them on the back seat. She said: 'The police officer told . me I needed to get car seats for my children as it was dangerous for . them to travel without them. 'When I told him they were dolls, he wouldn't believe me - I think he thought I was crazy! 'Once . he had seen the dolls close up he realised they weren't real babies, . but it shows how much they look like real children - that's why I love . them. 'No relationship will . ever come between me and my babies, and I wouldn't give them up for my . children. It's me and the babies - they're everywhere.'

Burger King (Glendale, California chain is pictured) is the 2nd largest U.S. hamburger chain . Pants only: Burger King employees wear black pants with a store-issued shirt for their uniform (left) but Ms McShan requested to wear a dark skirt instead, like those worn by adherents of the Pentecostal faith (right) Ms McShan was a 17-year-old high school senior just looking to get a summer job in August 2010, when she applied to work as a cashier at the restaurant. Burger King employees wear black pants with a store-issued Burger King shirt when serving customers and during her interview for the spot, she says she was forthright about her beliefs and asked to wear a black skirt instead. She is a part of the Christian Pentecostal denomination, whose members adhere to Old Testament guidelines from Deuteronomy 22:5 that states: 'A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.' Pentecostals apply this to mean women should not wear pants and should also not cut their hair, to distinguish their appearance from men. Biblical law: Pentecostal girls (like those pictures) adhere to Old Testament guidelines from Deuteronomy to wear skirts and keep their hair long . Her manager 'assured her that she could wear a skirt to work,' according to the EEOC lawsuit filed on her behalf, against Fries Restaurant Management. 'However, when she arrived at work for orientation, the store management informed Ms McShan that she could not wear a skirt and that she had to leave the store.' 'Ms McShan was required to leave despite her explanation that she was wearing the skirt with the understanding that she would be allowed a religious accommodation,' the filing added. The lawsuit alleges her manager failed to accommodate her request to comply with her religious guidelines for dress. Burger King, the second-largest U.S. hamburger chain, did not respond to a request to comment about the lawsuit filed against the franchise operator. Pentecostals: There are an estimated 80 million members of the denomination in the U.S. The church is known for its focus on the importance of spiritual gifts like prophecy, speaking in tongues and faith healing . 'It was a very simple request - to be able to wear a long black skirt and not black pants, and it was initially granted,' EEOC attorney Meaghan Shepard told the Dallas Morning News. 'She was responsible, tried to get in touch with someone higher in the franchise, and they never responded to her. In our eyes, it was so clear-cut. She’s a very sweet, articulate young lady who was just trying to work her senior year in high school,' Shepard added. 'It was a very simple request - to be able to wear a long black skirt and not black pants, and it was initially granted' The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life estimates there are 80 million Pentecostals and Charismatics, a movement within the denomination, in the U.S. The majority of U.S. Pentecostals are found in the south. The evangelical denomination believes in the strict application of commands in the Bible and is distinguished from other Christian movements by its focus on the importance of spiritual gifts like prophecy, speaking in tongues and faith healing. Well-known figures in the movement include the late Oral Roberts, who founded Oral Roberts University, and Pat Robertson, a powerful figure in the Religious Right who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1988.","Pentecostal girls must comply with Old Testament guidelines to 'not wear men’s clothing'

Experienced: Richard White, a 49-year-old father with a young daughter, had hiked Denali before . The hiker mauled and eaten by a grizzly bear in Alaska's Denali National Park this weekend was an experienced explorer who loved traveling to remote areas alone, his family said. Wildlife officials believe Richard White, a 49-year-old scientist from San Diego, California, simply got too close to the 600-pound predator as he photographed it grazing on Friday. For nearly eight minutes, the bear didn't realize Mr White was there and continued foraging. The pictures on Mr White's camera, which park rangers discovered after his death, reveal the last peaceful moments before the bear noticed him 40 yards away and charged. Mr White was married with a 21-month-old daughter named Mona. However, he liked to escape alone into the wilderness whenever he could find the time to get away, his father told the San Diego Union-Tribune. 'He had a real zest for seeing the phenomena in the world and interacting with people all over the globe,' Byron White told the newspaper. 'He also liked hiking alone in these remote places. He enjoyed being out in the wilderness.' Richard White had been the director of exploratory pharmacology at Ferring Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, though he was in the process of changing jobs. He was an experienced hiker who had been to Denali before and took a bear safety course that is mandatory for all back country hikers in the Park. It includes instructions on how to avoid disturbing bears and what to do if attacked. Mr White's death is the first known fatal bear attack on a human in the 90-year history of national park. Wildlife officials have worked to keep strict rules about human and wildlife interaction. Officials recommend hikers carry bear . spray, powerful chemicals that work like the pepper spray police . officers carry, which can stop a bear charge without permanent harm to . the animal. Grim Discovery: Evidence of the attack was found Friday afternoon by a trio of hikers, who came upon a lone backpack lying near a park river . Other explorers carry powerful rifles, shotguns and pistols to protect themselves. Mr White carried neither. His only defense -- a safety whistle. Park rules say hikers should keep a quarter-mile distance from bears and back away whenever they see one of the dangerous animals. Mr White was just 40 yards away when he was killed -- 10 times closer than he should have been, the Anchorage Daily News reports. 'Certainly too close,' Pete Webster, Denali's chief park ranger, told the newspaper. A state trooper shot and killed the bear, a 5-year-old male grizzly . on Saturday and investigators examined its stomach contents and to confirm it had killed Mr White. Rugged: Denali National Park home to Mt. McKinley. It spans more than 6 million acres and is home to numerous wild animals, including bears, wolves, caribou and moose . Wide berth: Hikers are told to give grizzly bears a quarter-mile distance and slowly back away from any bears they see . The fearsome grizzly bear, and its coastal cousin the brown bear, is the second-largest land predator on the planet -- bested only by the polar bear. Despite their massive size and ferocious speed, fatal bear attacks are extremely rare in North America -- averaging less than two a year. Black bears, which are smaller but live in much closer proximity to urban areas, kill more people than grizzlies. The last fatal grizzly bear mauling in Alaska was more than seven years ago. Rich and Kathy Huffman were attacked in their tent in June 2005 in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, along the Hulahula River. This following is a list of fatal grizzly bear mauling in North America: . 2012: 1 -- Denali National Park, Alaska . 2011: 2 -- Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming . 2010: 2 -- Gallatin National Forest, Montana, and Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming . 2009: 0 . 2008: 2 -- Alberta, Canada, and Big Bear Lake, California . 2007: 1 -- Alberta, Canada . 2006: 1 -- Yukon Territory, Canada . 2005: 4 -- British Columbia, Canada, Alberta, Canada, and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska . 2004: 0 . 2003: 2 -- Katmai National Park, Alaska . 2002: 0 . The hiker was backpacking alone along . the Toklat River on Friday afternoon when he came within 40 yards of the . bear and began snapping photographs. He was so close, he used a . wide-angle lens instead his telephoto, the pictures reveal. 'They show the bear grazing in the willows, not acting aggressive in any form or manner during that period of time,' Denali Park Superintendent Paul Anderson said. Officials learned of the attack after . hikers stumbled upon an abandoned backpack along the river about three . miles from a rest area on Friday afternoon. The hikers also spotted torn . clothing and blood. They immediately hiked back and alerted staff park. Rangers in a helicopter spotted a . large male grizzly bear sitting on the hiker's remains, which they . called a 'food cache' in the underbrush about 100 to 150 yards from the . site of the attack on Friday. 'Over the years, and especially since . the 1970s, the park has worked very diligently to minimize the conflict . between humans and wildlife in the park,' Mr Anderson said. 'We have some of the most stringent . human-wildlife conflict regulations in the National Park system, and I . think those are largely responsible for the fact that there hasn't been a . fatal attack.'

"By . Daniel Martin and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 17:38 EST, 27 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:37 EST, 28 August 2012 . A senior Tory believes David Cameron must ask himself if he is 'a man or a mouse?' and unless he backs a third runway at Heathrow the Prime Minister will lose his job. Former Environment minister Tim Yeo today launched an astonishing attack on his leader and urged him to ignore his Lib Dem coalition colleagues and back expansion at Britain's largest airport. Mr Yeo, a once vociferous opponent of the scheme, warned that unless Mr Cameron is bold in his decisions he risks sinking into 'insignificance' and will be toppled as Tory leader. It came as Tory Transport Secretary Justine Greening admitted she could quit the cabinet if the Prime Minister tried to force through a third runway for Heathrow. Scroll down for video . Hard choices: David Cameron has been told he must back expansion at Heathrow to show intent and perhaps save his job . But last night, in an article in a national . newspaper, Mr Yeo said Mr Cameron must ‘find his sense of mission’ and . drop his objections to it. 'The Prime Minister must ask himself whether he is a man or a mouse,’ he said. ‘Does he want to be another Harold Macmillan, presiding over a dignified slide to insignificance? ‘Or is there somewhere inside his heart... a trace of Thatcher, determined to reverse the direction of our ship? ‘An immediate go-ahead for a third . runway will symbolise the start of a new era, the moment the Cameron . government found its sense of mission. Let’s go for it.’ Mr Yeo said he had changed his mind over a third runway after realising the UK was 'falling behind' in aviation capacity and urged the Prime Minister to show 'political courage' and said a . third runway could be approved even without Liberal Democrat support. The business case for the move is now 'overwhelming' and . environmental concerns have been addressed by aviation being brought . within the European Union emissions cap, Mr Yeo said. Man or mouse? Tim Yeo has urged his leader to be . bold or face drifting into 'insignificance' like some former Prime . Ministers before him . Tim Yeo has said that the issue of a 3rd runway at Heathrow will show if Cameron is a man or a mouse. Which do you think he is? He insisted he was not 'throwing down a gauntlet' to Mr Cameron, but . told the BBC: 'I am saying there is a terrific opportunity for him to . show really strong leadership from the front and to set out, something . which is not clear to everyone yet, what his vision of Britain is going . to be in 2020. 'I think we would like some clarity on that and I hope he shares my view that we need to be a business-friendly country. 'I think that David Cameron still has a large number of well-wishers . in the Conservative Party, of whom I am one. I am a supporter of him, . but I do want him to say, in what I would think is a very mature way, . when circumstances change, when the needs of the country evolve, I am . prepared to revisit decisions I made four years ago. 'I think he would have tremendous support both inside Parliament and outside if he is brave enough to do that this month.' Mr Yeo added: 'There's really every possible argument in favour of . it, what it does need is political courage. That's what I'm calling for. 'I think the opportunity is there, I think there is a sense inside . the Government that the tide is turning on this issue, but I would just . like to see it happen sooner rather than later.' He called for Mr Cameron to show 'a bit of steel on the economy' and . 'if the Lib Dems don't like it then maybe there's a majority in . Parliament without them on this issue'. His intervention comes just days . after housing minister Grant Shapps hinted that a future Tory government . could consider the option. Meanwhile senior Lib Dem sources say that a third Heathrow runway will never be agreed while they are helping run the country. During his election campaign, the Prime Minister promised not to build a third runway, in a bid to attract green voters. Transport Secretary Justine Greening admitted today she would find it 'difficult' to remain in a Government which backed a third runway at Heathrow as David Cameron faced renewed pressure to approve the expansion. Senior Conservative Tim Yeo questioned whether the Prime Minister had the character to take the politically explosive decision, which would involve tearing up the Coalition Agreement and risk a damaging split within his own party. But the Transport Secretary, a prominent campaigner against a third runway which she fears would directly affect the quality of life of her constituents in Putney, south-west London, insisted there was now a consensus against the development. She said a third runway would not be 'the right thing for Britain' because it would become rapidly outdated and insisted that a wholesale review of air capacity was needed. Asked on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme whether she could continue to serve in Government if a third runway was approved, she said: 'I think it would be difficult for me to do that. ‘This won’t be a full length runway and it can’t take the modern bigger planes we need in the long term. ‘The coalition agreement is very clear, we don’t support a third runway at Heathrow.' There was a need to be 'bold' and look at including the possibility of a new hub airport like Boris Island, she said. 'It's clearly one of the options. It will be open to people to put that forward as an option.' But in recent months the Tories have been wavering, amid fears their stance on airport expansion could be hurting the economy. The . Lib Dems remain totally opposed, as do some senior Tories, including . transport secretary Justine Greening and backbencher Zac Goldsmith. Meanwhile London Mayor Boris Johnson is pushing for an alternative scheme – an airport on an island in the Thames estuary. Mr . Yeo, chairman of the Commons energy and climate change committee, . yesterday told the BBC he had dropped his opposition to a third Heathrow . runway, which had been one of his key green beliefs. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is a race in which Britain is now falling behind and we need to get back into it. 'The business world is quite clear our . lack of airport capacity means they have a disadvantage competitively . against the rest of Europe.' Expansion would also 'create jobs and be . welcomed by the construction industry', he said. 'The . airlines are among the people pushing for this now very badly needed . expansion so that we don't continue to lose out against airports like . Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle, both of whom have twice as many . destinations in China, twice as many flights going to China.' However, he said, airlines might need to pay more for their emissions if capacity were to increase. Mr Yeo, a former environment minister, said he had previously been against airport expansion in the South East because he believed it would 'inevitably lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions'. But he said he changed his stance after aircraft emissions were brought within an overall EU cap for all industries in January. He argued this meant that as long as other industries continue to cut their emissions, those from aviation can increase. 'Even if we covered the whole of Surrey and Berkshire in new runways, it wouldn't actually lead to a single kilogram of extra greenhouse gas emissions taking place,' he said. Mr Yeo has faced calls to quit the climate change committee after it emerged earlier this month that he was paid £140,000 last year from the renewable energy sector. Addressing arguments by campaigners that a third runway would lead to intolerable noise, Mr Yeo said failing to expand Heathrow could in fact lead to more noise. He said: 'If you have a big, modern hub airport, airlines fly their most modern and quietest aircraft in there. If Heathrow falls behind, the quiet aircraft will go to Frankfurt, they'll go to Paris.” Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said the Government will not give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow. Speaking during a visit to a manufacturing firm in Wallsend, North Tyneside, the Liberal Democrat leader said ministers would stick to the Coalition Agreement which ruled out the expansion. He said: 'We're not going to give the go-ahead to the third runway at Heathrow because we said very clearly as both parties that we wouldn't do so, so we're going to stick to the Coalition Agreement. 'But that doesn't mean we're going to stick our heads in the sand over the aviation debate about capacity in this country and how do we make sure we have those proper connections to economies in Asia and Latin America which are important to our own prosperity and we'll make sure we look at that. 'But there are lots of ways of doing that and we shouldn't just lurch to one solution because one individual MP was to say so. 'My position is very clear - we're not going to give the go- ahead to a third runway at Heathrow. We said that in the Coalition Agreement and we're going to stick to that.' Former Labour chancellor Alastair Darling told the programme: 'Heathrow has more destinations than most other airports in the world. The advantage of Heathrow is it is there now, we can't go on putting this decision off.' John Stewart, of the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, said: 'The Department for Transport's own figures show we have sufficient capacity, even in London and the South East, until almost 2030.' Jane Thomas, of Friends of the Earth, said: 'The Tories were emphatic there would be no Heathrow expansion in 2010, and we still expect that commitment.' He argued that the fact that airlines have been brought within the EU cap on carbon emissions meant that airlines will have to develop greener planes to take advantage of an expanded Heathrow.","Transport Secretary Justine Greening says she may resign if PM backs a third runway for Heathrow .

Suspicious: Police are treating the deaths of Lucy Schwartz, pictured, and Joseph Berg as suspicious . A plastic surgeon and the girlfriend he was convicted of kidnapping and tying up with medical tape last year have been found dead, in a suspected murder suicide. A family member discovered the bodies of Joseph Berg, 47, and Lucy Schwartz, 49, just before noon on Monday in the man's Salt Lake City home after he failed to answer his telephone, according to Utah County Deputy Attorney Craig Johnson. Police said there were no signs of trauma on the couple's bodies but are treating the deaths as suspicious. 'It’s still so early on in the . investigation, we can’t even say what the cause of death is,' Orem . police Sgt. Craig Martinez told the Salt Lake City Tribune. He added that this won't be known until autopsy and toxicology reports are released. Detectives . cordoned off the quiet cul-de-sac where the couple were living and forensics were moving in and out of . the property on Monday evening, searching for evidence. In April, the 47-year-old had been ordered to spend six months in jail for assaulting Schwartz, his longtime girlfriend. Berg . was arrested in November following a 911 call where dispatchers heard a . woman in the background crying and pleading for help. Police discovered . Berg at the home with a woman bound in medical tape. The woman was tied to a dresser, had a rag stuffed in her mouth and the man had dragged her down the hall by her hair. Martinez told the Herald Extra that Berg got out of jail on August 23. He was behind bars for just less than four months but was released early on good behaviour. In November of 2011, Dr. Joseph Berg was arrested for tying his girlfriend Lucelia Schwartz to a dresser with medical tape . Dead: Lucy Schwartz, pictured, was found dead alongside Berg at the surgeon's Salt Lake City home this afternoon . Kidnapped: Schwartz, pictured here with an unknown child, was kidnapped by Berg last year but the couple remained together . Police believe the deaths occurred sometime between Sunday night and late Monday morning as the couple had been out to dinner with family members over the weekend. 'It's a tragedy not only that he is dead but that someone is dead with him,' Johnson told reporters yesterday. 'Obviously, something went horribly wrong.' According to the Herald Extra, a realtor said the house where the two were found no longer belongs to Berg. Jeane Tanner with Summit Realty said the home at 479 E. 1450 North was sold on July 12. Martinez said a family member of Berg’s was renting the property and that he had not broken into the home. In addition to jail time, Berg was sentenced to three years of probation, anger management and substance abuse treatment. At his sentencing earlier this year, Berg’s attorney admitted his client was addicted to pain killers. Schwartz defended her boyfriend in court. 'I know in my heart he will be back and regain the success he had before the addiction took hold,' she said at the hearing. Orem home: The couple were found dead at Berg's north Orem home, pictured, by a family member . Tied up: Schwartz, pictured, defended her boyfriend at his April sentencing . Berg was stripped of his physician, . surgeon and his controlled substance prescribing licenses last November, . after an emergency hearing. In . the suspension order, the Utah Division of Occupational and . Professional Licensing said Berg’s staff had quit en masse because he . was acting peculiarly. The workers reported the man had been . falling asleep standing up, swallowing handfuls of pills and buying . drugs not used in his practice, according to the newspaper. The Utah plastic surgeon's troubles had persisted since his sentencing in April. In . June, a former patient filed a lawsuit against him claiming that he . tried to operate on her using a 'pickle fork' after her anesthetic wore . off. Grieving: An acquaintance of the parties involved, right, reacts to the news outside the home where the couple were found dead . Jennifer Swalberg scheduled an abdominoplasty and liposuction procedure with the clinic that Berg ran in Orem in May 2011. The lawsuit states that Swalberg's work was not professional and during one follow-up appointment he administered steroids and a local anesthetic, left the room for an hour and then returned where he 'repeatedly stabbed (Swalberg's) insides with a 'pickle fork'. The horrific recount of the patient's . visit to Berg is part of the lawsuit filed in court, which alleges he . committed health care malpractice, battery, lack of informed consent and . negligence. According to Springer, the medical ordeal began when Swalberg visited Dr. Berg for cosmetic surgery after losing weight. During the first procedure, Dr. Berg . removed 8.8 litres of fat, which the court documents describe as a . 'large amount that significantly increased the risk of post-operative . complications such as tissue necrosis and fluid accumulation.' Dean Zabriskie, (left), appears with his client, Joseph Berg at the 4th District Court, in Provo, Utah . Instead . of making a straightforward recovery, Swalberg alleges that she was . told to wear compression garments, but was not informed 'regarding . post-op drainage' said the Herald Extra. Dr. Berg is alleged to have performed surgery on Jennifer Swalberg using a pickle fork . Filed in June, the lawsuit claimed that Swalberg returned to Dr. Berg with pustulent wounds, 'draining blood and purulent fluid.' Attending to Swalberg's complaint, Dr. Berg is accused of shoving gauze into her post-surgery wounds with his fingers and failing to take and record proper notes. Paying Dr. Berg's Cosmetic Plastic Surgery Institute and Day Spa two more visits in June where she received similar treatment, Swalberg alleges that in August, she had been waiting for Swalberg for three hours when she heard a loud crash in the hallway. 'Jennifer opened the door to see what . had happened,' the documents state, 'and she saw Dr. Berg splayed out . across the floor, his eyes open and glazed.' It . was during another August visit that Dr. Berg is alleged to have used a . non-surgical instrument to perform surgery on Swalberg. Administering . steroids and local anesthetic to the wounds which had not healed after . three months, Dr.Berg is supposed to have left Swalberg along for an . hour. When he returned he cut open the Utah woman's scarring, even though the anesthetic had worn off. Taking . to the open flesh with a 'pickle fork', Dr. Berg told Swalberg that the . repeated stabbing would loosen the scar tissue, the lawsuit states. 'It . was excruciatingly painful, and (Swalberg) began bleeding . profusely...Dr. Berg instructed (Swalberg) to hold a paper wrapper . against the site to control the bleeding.' Dr. Berg bows his head at the 4th District Court, in Provo, Utah . These new wounds refused to heal and became odorous and filled with blood and pus alleges Swalberg through her lawyer Springer. Phoning Dr.Berg for another appointment, his staff refused to schedule one and then eventually stopped answering the phone states Swalberg. 'The scarring is permanent both on the inside and outside,' said Springer. 'We just don't want this to happen to somebody else. We want to send a message that this is improper.' With no previous criminal history, . prosecutors pressed for the most lenient sentence for Dr. Berg after he . tied his girlfriend to a dresser at his home and phoned 911 in distress. Dr. Berg's girlfriend Lucelia Schwartz speaks at the sentencing for her boyfriend in April . After he was arrested by police for the November 2011 attack, investigators discovered that he was abusing prescription drugs and his medical license was revoked. An emergency order from the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing in December of 2011 heard that Berg had 29 prescriptions for himself, one for a controlled substance, and 21 for his live-in girlfriend, the order said. Of those, 20 were for a controlled substance. Drugs illegally in his possession included hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl patches. Defending his actions to the judge during his April sentencing he said that he suffered from A.D.D and depression and would now be battling prescription pill addiction for the rest of his life. The lawsuit from Swalberg seeks special, general and punitive damages and will be asking for at least $300,000.","Joseph Berg, 47, and Lucy Schwartz, 49, found dead in Salt Lake City home just before noon on Monday .

Vile: Rasul Abdullah is a serial sex attacker who had previously won a legal fight to stay in Britain but has now begged to leave . An immigrant sex attacker who managed to claim asylum in Britain begged to go home to Iraq after he was jailed for four years. Rasul Abdullah, 31, was branded a 'menace' and a 'sexual predator' after he groped two women in a nightclub on the same night and then took a young mother captive and molested her while on bail. Abdullah begged a judge at Burnley Crown Court in Lancashire . to send him back to Iraq saying he 'no longer wanted to stay in Britain' after he was convicted of two charges of sexual assault and one of . assault by penetration. The offences occurred over a three month period after Abdullah, an Iraqi Kurd, was allowed by the Government to remain in the UK indefinitely. He will now serve his sentence in a British jail and could be deported afterwards. One of the nightclub victims said her once confident personality had dissolved after the attack and she became afraid to leave the house. The young mother said she no longer went out or interacted with anybody and was frightened of coming across her attacker again. Abdullah was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life and was given a 10 year sexual offences prevention order, banning him from entering or remaining anywhere licensed for the consumption of alcohol on the premises, between 11pm and 8am. Sentencing, the judge Mr Recorder Nick Clarke QC told him: 'I saw for myself the impact that these offences had on these women. 'I have no doubt that you were a sexual predator, who took opportunities to impose yourself upon each of the three separate victims. At the time you were clearly out of control and you were certainly a menace to the women that you targeted.' Earlier Mr Joe Boyd, prosecuting, said the first offences too place just after 2am, last November 6, when one of the women was on the dance floor in Pharoah’s bar in Burnley. She felt a hand go underneath her skirt and she jumped forward before turning to see who the culprit was. The victim was said to be 'very upset' and pointed out Abdullah, as he came out of the ladies’ toilets, to the bar manager. Abdullah was detained by staff until police arrived to arrest him. Whilst the woman was still in tears following the assault, a second woman approached her to say he had also groped her by putting his hand up her dress and touching her bottom. Dancefloor deviant: Rasul Abdullah groped two women in Pharoah's Egyptian Bar in Burnley . She was extremely angry and also upset. The second victim said she had seen Abdullah going into the ladies’ toilets. When she subsequently went to the lavatory, an Asian man had . put his head around the door and she realised it was the same man. Both women picked out Abdullah at an identity parade. He was questioned but bailed and the following January began chatting up the young mother after spotting her pushing her baby in a pram ouside his home. Abdullah asked her in and 'stupidly ; she agreed, out of politeness. But as the baby looked on, he suddenly locked the front door, grabbed the young woman and tried to hug, kiss and touch her. She pushed him off, screamed and shouted to be let go and he finally unlocked the door and let them out. Mr Boyd said : 'She was extremely upset by what had happened and spoke to the headmistress at the school where one of her children attended. Police were called and the defendant was arrested.' Abdullah claimed to officers the women who had been in the nightclub were mistaken or simply lying. When asked about the third victim, he claimed the young mother had been banging on his door demanding sex before going into his house saying: ;I love you. I love you.' Attack: Burnley Crown Court, pictured, heard about his crimes and then Abdullah's pleas to return to Iraq . Abdullah claimed he was 'extremely frightened' of the young mum and added: 'She was just after sex - I threw her out of the house.' His counsel Martin Hackett said: 'I concede at the outset that clearly there has to be a custodial sentence. These were very unpleasant offences.' Before he was taken from the court dock, Abdullah told the judge, . through his Kurdish- speaking interpreter that he wanted to be sent back . to Iraq. He said : “ I don’t want to stay in this country anymore.” After the case, Det Con David Greenwood commended the “ professionalism” shown by the staff of Pharoah’s on the night of the two attacks. He said the manager, Shaun Grogan had detained Abdullah at the scene and held him until police arrived. The officer continued : 'Without the involvement of the staff and their actions at the time, the likelihood is this man may have gone untraced and unpunished.'","Rasul Abdullah told the judge 'I don't want to stay in this country anymore' after he got four years in prison .

Fans will be unable to watch any events live, despite the U.S. team of 223 athletes being the third largest at the London Games after Britain and China. Burning curiosity: U.S. viewers were unable to watch the glittering Paralympics opening ceremony live . Disappointed fans: NBC's coverage of the Paralympics has been confined to highlights shows and daily YouTube packages . The network will wait until September 16 - seven days after the Games end - before screening a 90-minute special on the Paralympics. Equality campaigners complain that Paralympic athletes are not being treated as the equal of their able-bodied teammates. Damon Herota, an IT consultant in Florida who has launched an online campaign calling for better coverage, said: ‘It’s a sign of disrespect, especially to those military veterans who are competing. Attitudes are supposed to have changed since the days of Vietnam, when veterans were ignored. What message does this send?’ 'The effect on people would be simply amazing and the barriers it would break down between able-bodied Americans and the disabled would be monumental,' added Mr Herota, whose petition has so far attracted about 1,300 signatures. 'Disrespectful:' Some viewers have started an online petitions and say the move is offensive to the athletes . Big showing: NBC insists its coverage is a major increase on previous years, up from the single 90-minute programme it offered from the Beijing Paralympics . Disappointed viewers have now started several online petitions in an effort to persuade the network to change their policy. Amy Quincy, from Florida, wrote on change.org: 'It would be an opportunity for NBC to take a big step toward the recognition of physically challenged athletes who have reached the pinnacle of their physical abilities and are competing at a world class level.' NBC insists its coverage represents a . major increase on previous years, up from the single 90-minute programme . it offered from the Beijing Paralympics. It also points out that the . U.S. Olympic Committee, and not the network itself, controls broadcast . rights to the Paralympics. The news follows criticism of NBC during the Olympic Games over not showing key events live. Instead, it showed them on tape-delay in primetime slots - which still drew in record audiences. Interrupted: Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of The Who perform during the Closing Ceremony.

But many of the gripers were apparently still watching anyway and, for some, knowing the results only whetted their appetite to see how the competition played out. Many of the Twitter complaints were posted with the hashtag #nbcfails. 'The #Olympics don't revolve around USA time zone or #NBC's prime time. Air it live NBC!' one user posted.

It is regarded as the single finest car built by Aston Martin in the famous firm's 99-year history. So it is little wonder that this spectacular model - winner of the 1959 Le Mans 24-hour race - is set to become the most expensive British car ever. Built in 1957, the immaculate Aston Martin DBR1/2  went on sale yesterday for a staggering £20million. Iconic: This classic Aston Martin regarded as one of the finest cars of all time, has been put up for sale for a British record £20million . Racing engine: The 1957 sports car, which has been raced its entire life and meticulously maintained, has now come onto the market for the first time in years . The green two-seater is the company's most successful racing car ever, dominating motorsport in the late-1950s and the only Aston Martin to take the chequered flag at Le Mans. Yesterday an expert on the marque who saw its triumph over 50 years ago said it was 'a joy' to see its current state and that the massive price tag was no surprise. If a buyer can meet the asking price, it will be four times the previous record for the public sale of a British car, an iconic 1929 Bentley which fetched £5million at auction in June. The Aston Martin is being sold by Ascot-based Ferrari specialists Talacrest, who also handled the purchase by the present owner - who has not been named - 20 years ago. Champagne moment: Stirling Moss at Le Mans 1959 with the iconic Aston Martin, with his team Roy Salvadori, David Brown and Carroll Shelby . Founder John Collins described it as 'the holy grail of motoring' and 'the most recognisable and valuable Aston Martin in history'. 'I would say it is one of the top five cars in the world, and models of this calibre and undisputed provenance are rarely available on the open market,' he added. 'It is road registered so you can just jump in it and drive it to the local shops. 'It is one of the most successful and instantly recognisable historic racing cars in the world today and has undisputed provenance and is ready to race.' Asking price: If a buyer can meet the £20m valuation it will be four times the previous record for the public sale of a British car, an iconic 1929 Bentley which fetched £5million at auction . Spectacular: Despite its age Aston Martin historian Brian Joscelyne said 'It handles so well and can slide around corners in spectacular fashion' Success: Victories at Le Mans and Goodwood in the late 1950s makes this car one of the most iconic in motor sports . Designated DBR1/2 as it was the second of four DBR1s to be completed, its honours also include victory in the 1957 Spa 1,000 km race. The DBR1/2 is the single most successful racing car ever built by Aston Martin. After its victorious debut at the 1957 Spa 1000 km race, it scored five more victories. Most important of all was the win in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959 in the hands of Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby. This high point in Aston's history came in 1959 but there was also a big victory in what was one of Sir Stirling Moss's greatest races in the Goodwood Tourist Trophy. The model is called the Aston Martin DBR1 and the /2 denotes the second of four factory models. A fifth DBR1 was built for a private handler.DBR stands for David Brown Racing, with David Brown the businessman who owned Aston Martin. Sir Stirling Moss was driving it when he won the RAC Tourist Trophy at Goodwood in 1958 and 1959. But its 1959 Le Mans triumph with Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori behind the wheel was its finest moment, reaching speeds in excess of 160mph. In recent years it has continued to be raced regularly, while being meticulously maintained. Aston Martin historian Brian Joscelyne, who was watching from the pit lane, said yesterday: 'It is a joy whenever I see the car because it means so much to me. 'The Aston Martins ended up coming first and second and at last, after all their hard work, Aston Martin had finally got there and won Le Mans. It was a very emotional moment for everyone. 'They were so far ahead of the next Ferrari that they could have pulled over, had a wash and a meal and still comfortably beaten won.' And he added: 'The car has been very well looked after and has had very good owners. 'It handles so well and with the right drivers can slide around corners in spectacular fashion. 'This is the model to have, it is an astonishing all-round car.' The most expensive car ever sold is thought to be a Ferrari 250GTO also driven by Sir Stirling which fetched $35million (£22million) earlier this year. Domination: During its period of success it dominated the Ferraris and Jaguars of its day and is the only Aston Martin to ever win Le Mans . Retired: Upon winning the 1959 championship, David Brown announced Aston Martin's withdrawal from the Sportscar Championship . Pricey: The £20m price tag will make it one of the most expensive cars of all time .","The iconic DBR1/2 won the 1959 Le Mans 24-hour race and was driven to victory at Goodwood by Moss .

More than 20 pilot whales beached themselves on a South Florida beach on Saturday, triggering a daylong effort by state and national officials, nearby residents and others to save them. By evening, five pilot whales — two calves and three juveniles — had been transported to Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Institute for rehabilitation. The remaining pod had died of natural causes or had to be humanely euthanized, said Allison Garrett, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s fisheries service. Scroll down for video . Rescue efforts: Among a pod of 22 pilot whales who beached themselves on Saturday morning along a Florida beach, 17 were unable to be rescued despite local officials and residents aid . Survivors: By Saturday evening two calves and three juveniles were transported to Florida Atlantic University¿s Harbor Branch Institute for rehabilitation, as the sole survivors . 'It was not possible to rehabilitate them,' she told the Associated Press. The pod of 22 whales came ashore on Saturday morning at Avalon Beach State Park in St. Lucie County. They ranged from calves and juveniles to adult whales. Garrett said it was unclear why the whales became stranded. 'Pilot whales are very social animals,' she added. 'One scenario could be one of the animals was sick. They won’t leave (a sick whale). They'll stay together.' For this reason, it’s useless to push pilot whales back into the ocean, Blair Mase, stranding coordinator for NOAA’s Southeast Region, told TCPalm.com. Support: A calf is seen before rescue workers raise the small whale into an awaiting pool of water before transporting them to the Harbor Branch Institute . Reasoning: It was unclear why the whales became stranded though they're known to stay together, till death do they part, if one of them falls sick . ‘If you push them into the water, they'll just keep coming back and stranding themselves again,' said Mase, who was surfing in the area when he noticed people running toward the beached whales. - Blair Mase, stranding coordinator for NOAA’s Southeast Region . TCPalm.com reports that hundreds of residents came to the beach to assist with the rescue, helping the animals turn upright so they could breathe better. Volunteers covered the whales with moist towels and poured water over them. Red Cross volunteers helped ensure that volunteers stayed hydrated in the hot sun. 'I think that people want to help animals,' said Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisth, a Harbor Branch volunteer who worked with others to tend to juveniles in a shaded inflatable pool. ‘Especially whales and dolphins, because they are our counterparts in the seas. They’re mammals, they’re intelligent, they’re social. They’re a lot like us.' Turn out: Hundreds of residents came to the beach to assist with the rescue, helping the animals turn upright so they could breathe better . Hospice: Officials and volunteers spent the day assessing the health of the whales to see which could be rehabilitated, and then making the others comfortable . Still, there was a sad undercurrent to the efforts, with rescuers aware that most of the whales were dying. Garrett said there was no obvious sign of trauma or injury to the whales, but that necropsies would be performed on them. She said officials and volunteers spent the day assessing the health of the whales to see which could be rehabilitated, and then making the others comfortable. She said the last such beaching in the area came in May 2011, on the Florida Keys.

Patients will soon be able to find out whether their GP or hospital is rationing drugs to save money. Ministers are to force all NHS trusts to publish lists of any new treatments they are refusing to give patients – even though they have been approved by the health watchdog NICE. Under the plans – which will be rolled out this Autumn – trusts will also have to explain to the public why these drugs are not yet available. New plans: Patients will soon be able to find out whether their GP or hospital is rationing drugs to save money . The Government hopes the scheme will end the so-called postcode lottery of NHS treatment whereby a patient’s chance of being offered certain drugs may be entirely dependent on where they live. Only last year it emerged as many as a quarter of all Primary Care Trusts were refusing to prescribe patients some treatments even though they had been approved for NHS use by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, or NICE. Trusts were found to be trying to save money by holding back life-extending cancer treatments as well as medicines for heart disease, asthma, diabetes and epilepsy. Health Minister Paul Burstow said patients had a right to drugs and treatments that were approved by NICE . Ministers hope the so-called new ‘scorecards’ will encourage trusts to make the drugs available as soon as they are approved by NICE. Health Minister Paul Burstow said: ‘Patients have a right to drugs and treatments that have been approved by NICE. This new regime will be a catalyst for change - we are determined to eradicate variation and drive up standards for everyone. ‘NHS organisations must make sure the latest NICE-approved treatments are available in their area, and if they are not, then they will now be responsible for explaining why not. Being transparent with data like this is the hallmark of a 21st century NHS. It is a fundamental tool to help healthcare professionals improve patient care.’ Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE said: ‘It will be valuable not just to patients but also help hospitals assess how well they’re performing and ensure that best practice is rapidly disseminated across the NHS. ‘We know that changing professional practice in medicine, like any other profession, can take time. Doctors, although broadly positively orientated, nevertheless take time to be made aware of the benefits of new treatments and drugs for the patients they are responsible for.’ But critics, including senior GPs and NHS managers, warned the system would create ‘unnecessary bureacracy’ – which may even delay treatments being made available. Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs said: ‘Will it be a bureaucratic tickbox or will it be something more sensible? And David Stout, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation warned publishing the lists would create incur extra costs on the health service’s  increasingly strained budget. He said: ‘Any new costs have to be offset by savings elsewhere. ‘It is important that any new measures do not lead to unnecessary bureaucracy or a duplication of information with no real benefits for hospitals, GPs or patients.’ Currently some Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) delay offering new drugs as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), while other areas use them on patients straight away. Under the scheme, which is expected to be rolled out before autumn, hospitals will have 'no excuse not to provide the latest NICE-approved drugs and treatments', the Department of Health said. NHS organisations will be automatically added on to publicly available lists of what drugs are available in local areas. It is hoped the rules will create a level playing field for treatments such as IVF, for which patients living in different regions have had varying levels of opportunity for the treatment.

Last year a report found more than 70 per cent of NHS trusts were ignoring Nice guidance to offer infertile couples three chances at IVF, and some stopped funding treatment altogether. The study, from a cross-party group of MPs, found PCTs placed strict restrictions on who is eligible for IVF. Most PCTs put limits on the age at which they will treat women - but one PCT was only allowing women to be treated between the ages of 39 and 40. This means younger women can wait years for NHS treatment despite the fact fertility declines with age. Some of Nice’s most recent guidance, recommending an extended time to administer a clot-busting drug to treat stroke patients, for example, will soon have to be taken on by all hospitals. The Department of Health said the regime will be made up of three different parts: .","Ministers are to force all NHS trusts to publish lists of any new treatments they are refusing to give patients .
Under the plans trusts will also have to explain to the public why these drugs are not yet available .
Scheme is to be be rolled out in the Autumn .
An 'innovation scorecard' will be published, which will allow patients and the public to see which organisations are quickly adopting the latest Nice-approved drugs and treatments; .
The NHS will have no excuse not to provide the latest Nice-approved drugs and treatments.

According to professors at the University of California, Mitt Romney scores in the 99th percentile of all politicians for his looks alone, far outpacing his running mate Paul Ryan, whose rock hard abs only earned him a spot in the 67th percentile. The study was conducted to measure the 'competence' of politicians and how much, if any, their attractiveness affected the outcomes of their elections. Hot Or Not: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are one of the hottest presidential tickets this nation has ever seen and now there's proof that its not just their politics . Dangerous Duo: According to professors at the University of California, Mitt Romney scored in the 99 percentile of all politicians, far outpacing his running mate Paul Ryan, who's rock hard abs earned him only a spot in the 67th percentile of attractiveness . 'Mitt Romney is better looking than almost everyone reading this,' Professor Ryan Enos wrote when describing his work. In 2007, political science professors Matthew Atkinson, Seth Hill and Ryan Enos presented the faces of prominent politicians to University of California students for a split second and had them rank 'how competent' the person appeared. 'The students seeing the candidates did not know that they were politicians,' Mr Enos told the Mail Online. 'We believe that “competence” relates to general attractiveness, thus the fact that Romney and Palin both do quite well.' Mrs Palin scored in the 95th percentile. High Ranking: The study was conducted to measure the 'competence' of politicians and how much, if any, their attractiveness affected the outcomes of their elections. Sarah Palin scored in the 95th percentile . 'Their answers appear to judge mostly just blunt attractiveness, but it is hard to know exactly what makes somebody think a face is “competent”', he said. 'If the election were decided on looks, it would be no contest.' Professor Ryan Enos . The trio presented all 728 of the governor and Senate candidates from 1994 to 2006 to the students, removing the highly recognizable ones so as not to cloud judgement. Mitt Romney's 99th percentile put him below just a few other politicians. 'Only four people scored higher than him: John Thune, the South Dakota Republican Senator; Russ Feingold, the former Wisconsin Democrat Senator; Craig Benson, the former New Hampshire Republican Governor; and John Sanchez, who had run for Governor of New Mexico as a Republican and is now the Lt. Governor of New Mexico,' Professor Enos said. Most of those topping the list of best-looking senators were male - the highest-scoring woman was 76-year-old Elizabeth Dole, who came in 14th place. Highs and Lows: South Dakota Senator John Thune, left, is considered the most attractive politician of them all, while Spencer Abraham, right, is considered the least attractive.

Mikulski (D-MD) At the time of the study, President Obama was already too well known, the professor said, so they were only able to size up Joe Biden. He scored in the 62nd percentile. 'So, if the election were decided on looks, it would be no contest,' Professor Enos said. 'Fortunately for Obama and Biden, the election is not decided by looks. As we point out in our paper associated with the study, most of the correlation between candidate appearance and election outcomes is probably spurious.' Most attractive woman: Elizabeth Dole was named the best-looking female senator despite her 76 years of age . Bad News: At the time of the study, President Obama was already too well known, the professor said, so they were only able to size up Joe Biden. He scored in the 62nd percentile . They ascertain that very few voters will cast their ballot based solely on looks alone, and even if they become more attractive during a race, it will only gain them 3.5. percentage points. 'Rather than good looks directly affecting voters’ decisions, it is likely that good looking people like Romney have a lot of success in life, obtain significant human capital - education, career success, education - and because of all they have to lose, they are strategic about which races they enter,' Professor Enos said.

Police in Nashville received a call last week about a woman who was drugged at a fire station and was paid to strip and perform sex acts on fire fighters. But after the allegations were investigated, the case got much more complicated, as investigators uncovered an alleged extortion theme. The claims led to several of Nashville’s Fire Station 24 to be put on administrative leave while the case is being investigated, and the arrest of two gang members. Scroll down for video . Under investigation: Fire Capt. James Overton, left, and fire fighter Quincy Corbitt, right, are on administrative leave while allegations over alleged sex acts with a prostitute . On leave: In total, five workers from Fire Station 24 were placed on paid administrative leave during the internal investigation . Last Saturday, police responded to a call of a woman who claimed she had been drugged at firefighter Jason Copeland’s home in Antioch, Tennessee. During the investigation, the 23-year-old woman told police that she and some of her friends had been to the fire hall at least once to perform sex acts in exchange for money, News Channel 5 reported. Metro Police Spokesperson Don Aaron told the station: ‘According to her and at least one other woman, there was stripping in exchange for money, and sexual activity for money at the fire hall.’ Five men in total – Capt. James Overton, engineer Kerry Sales, as well as firefighters Quincy Corbitt, Jason Copeland, and Darrin Bell – were placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation. None of the men were immediately charged with any crimes. The fire department is looking into the woman’s claims. However, Copeland told investigators that he was being blackmailed by the woman’s friend, saying that gang member Ray Dontrell Johnson demanded $500 from him. Blackmail: Two known gang members were caught in a sting operation at this Pizza Hut in Clarksville Pike after the investigation led police to them . The sting: Ray Dontrell Johnson, left, and Cortez Smith, right, were both arrested in an alleged extortion scheme; Johnson had allegedly blackmailed a fire fighter for $500 . Copeland said Johnson had warned ‘there will be blood’ if the sum wasn’t paid, Mr Aaron said. ‘His employment was also threatened by disclosure of his relationship with this 23-year-old and, I guess, other goings on.’ Mr Aaron told the Tennessean that officers set up a sting to catch Dontrell by pretending to pay the money in question. They placed the $500 in a car parked at a Pizza Hut in Clarksville Pike. Police said Dontrell, as well as gang member Cortez Deonte Smith, came to claim the money. They were both arrested on extortion charges. According to police, both are members of the Gangster Disciples. Deputy Fire Chief Kim Lawson told the Tennessean: ‘It is something we take very seriously, and we will continue the investigation and try to get to the bottom of it.’ Mr Aaron told the Tennessean that the 23-year-old woman’s story has been inconsistent, but added: ‘Regardless, this investigation has exposed major issues.’ The fire station did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The paper notes that there have been several other cases of extortion within the Nashville fire system in recent years.

American soldiers who return from wars abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan have a host of difficulties in front of them once they hang up their weapons and put their uniforms in the storage chest. But for many veterans, the horrors of war are haunting, and effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder are utterly debilitating, and may cause them to age prematurely. Researchers are seeing alarming patterns in young veterans’ health, with many otherwise healthy young men developing early-onset diabetes, heart disease, and slow metabolism leading to obesity. Scroll down for video . Shell shock: A U.S. Army Private takes cover during a controlled detonation to clear an area for setting up a check point Kandahar; scientists now claim that PTSD is causing vets to age more quickly . Flashbacks: Traumatic events, combined with adrenaline, make it easy for the brain to go back to the worst moments experienced by a soldier . In a ground-breaking consortium led by researchers from Boston University’s School of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and the Veterans Affairs office in Boston’s Jamaica Plain, data shows that about 30 per cent of veterans studied demonstrate these symptoms. Those with apparent PTSD even have signs of loss of grey matter in the brain, which USA Today notes should not happen until old age. According to the Pentagon, the number of soldiers with PTSD or brain injury has increased exponentially in recent years. The government organisation says that since 2000, more than 240,000 soldiers have reported traumatic brain injury. Many who have returned from warfare experience vivid flashbacks to horrific moments in combat – the sound of gunfire, explosions, and carnage. In the study, fronted by Draper Laboratory, the consortium of PTSD experts will look at gene data and psychophysiology to evaluate the disorder, as well as using MRIs to map out images of the brain. A sample of 2,953 American civilians and 345 military veterans was collected. Troubling signs: Researchers in Boston have been studying more than 340 veterans to further investigate physical factors of PTSD, including heart disease and obesity . Collaboration: Scientists and doctors are looking at the negative effects of PTSD on the brain . In many cases, MRI images of veterans aged 20-30 showed deteriorated brain matter likened to that of a 70-year-old. Ann Rasmusson, a psychiatrist and neurobiologist, told USA Today that traumatic stress, when left untreated, can cause the brain to become fixated on those moments and go back to them too easily. As a response to the relentless stress, the body simply ages faster, the researchers hypothesize. 'No one tells you how to shut it off. I spent a lot of time dealing with my demons.' -Veteran Ed Fox . Ed Fox, a 31-year-old veteran of the National Guard, witnessed nightly attacks during his tour to Iraq in 2004-2005. He told USA Today that he has constant flashbacks of mortar attacks and visions of dead bodies, adding that it was difficult to make stop. ‘No one tells you how to shut it off,’ he said.  ‘I spent a lot of time dealing with my demons.’ Dr William Milberg, a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard who is the co-director of the Translation Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) study based at the VA Boston Healthcare System, told MailOnline in an email that the brains of 150 veterans showed significant signs of stress. He wrote: 'The red areas are places where there are statistically consistent correlation's for a sample of over 150 participants in our study.  You are looking at the maps on two different sides of the brain. 'Another way of thinking of this is that the figure shows that in the places that are red and yellow the higher the degree of stress the thinner the top layer of cerebral cortex.' The statistical map shows that key areas of the 150 veterans' brains were similarly effected by trauma. Preliminary data: This is a composite of 150 veterans measuring areas of the brain effected by PTSD; in the places that are red and yellow the higher the degree of stress the thinner the top layer of cerebral cortex . On the rise: Traumatic brain injury, including PTSD, has risen alarmingly since 2005 . More than eight per cent of the . population will suffer from PTSD at some point in their lives, according . to Boston University’s School of Medicine. In addition to military fighters, civilians who have been exposed to traumatic events – such as car accidents – are prone to suffer from the condition. When left untreated, PTSD can lead to panic attacks, depression, substance abuse, weight gain, and heart disease. According to Draper Laboratory, more than half of those with the disorder are not properly diagnosed. This consortium hopes to find concrete chemical evidence to better diagnose and treat the disorder. ‘Although some biological characteristics that point to a PTSD diagnosis have already been identified, more comprehensive study is critical to examine the integrated roles of multiple potential biological factors of the condition,’Dr Roger Pitman, the director of the PTSD Research Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital and Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said in a statement. ‘This will help clinicians develop personalized treatment plans to improve outcomes, rather than relying on one-size-fits-all approaches.'","Consortium in Boston is studying PTSD in young veterans and those exposed to traumatic brain injury .

The doctor of a dementia patient was not responsible for a crash the 85-year-old woman caused that killed her longtime partner, a jury found on Thursday. The family of 90-year-old William Powers, who died in the 2010 crash, sued Dr Arthur Daigneault for wrongful death arguing that he should have initiated the process to strip Lorraine Sullivan of her driving license as he was treating her for dementia. As she drove back from grocery shopping on May 27 2010, Sullivan accidentally steered her Toyota Corolla into oncoming traffic, causing a crash which killed Powers, her partner of more than thirty years. Cleared: A jury found Dr Arthur Daigneault, right, not responsible for the death of William Powers, left. Powers died after his 85-year-old girlfriend, Lorraine Sullivan, crashed their car. Powers' family argued that Daigneault should have taken steps to remove Sullivan's driving license as he treated her for dementia . Arthur Daigneault, who practices near California’s Orange County retirement community Laguna Woods Village, had been treating Sullivan for dementia in the two years before the crash, reported the Los Angeles Times. Powers’ children, Craig Powers and Andrea Wooldridge, launched the wrongful death lawsuit believing that Daigneault should have alerted authorities that Sullivan may need to have her licence taken away. The case questions at which point doctors have a responsibility to alert the DMV that their elderly patients may have a problem with driving. California law requires doctors to report patients with 'disorders characterized by lapses of consciousness' to local health authorities, who then notify the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Under this law, doctors use their own judgement as to whether a patient is too impaired to be behind a wheel. In December 2007, Sullivan told Daigneault that she was suffering from memory loss, reported the L.A. Times. Tests showed declining memory loss over the next year and, in June 2009, Daigneault prescribed her an Alzheimer’s drug. Tragic: Craig Powers, left, lost his lawsuit against Arthur Daigneault. He sued the doctor for wrongful death of his father William Powers, right, who died in a car crash aged 90 in 2010 . The doctor changed her prescription to a different dementia drug when Sullivan reported that her memory getting worse. Two weeks before the accident, Daigneault saw Sullivan but did not consider her memory problems severe enough to report. Sullivan’s daughter testified that her mother was the same capable woman she had always been and said she was unaware her mother had been diagnosed for dementia, even though the two saw each other weekly. Powers himself had stopped driving early in 2010 on his family's insistence. However, his family didn’t express concern about him being a passenger in Sullivan’s car, according to court records. On May 27, Sullivan and Powers were headed home when Sullivan took a wrong left turn and a Mercedes smashed into the passenger side of the Toyota Corolla. Powers died from his injuries six weeks later. Sullivan, who suffered head injuries in the crash, has not driven since the accident. Wooldridge, 53, said that she hoped the case will take drivers with dementia off the road and prevent further accidents. Last year, the DMV stripped 26,428 people of their licenses for medical reasons; a breakdown of their ages and medical conditions was not available, reported the L.A. Times. The laws concerning elderly drivers . differs from state to state, in California, drivers older than 70 are . required to renew their licenses in person.","Lorraine Sullivan crashed her car in 2010, killing her passenger William Powers .

Blaise Fenn, 15, was shooting rabbits in the Kent countryside when he accidentally blasted himself in the head with a shotgun, police revealed today. The junior shooting champion had been reported missing before he was discovered lying in a field near his home with a gunshot wound to the right side of his head. Accident: Blaise Fenn was transferred to St George's Hospital in South London, where he is understood to remain in a stable condition . Blaise, who was conscious when he was discovered in Speldhurst, near Tunbridge Wells, at around 9pm on Monday, was treated by paramedics before being airlifted to Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. The 15-year-old was later transferred to St George's Hospital in South London, where he remains in a stable condition. The young marksman was crowned Junior Topham at Tonbridge School's rifle championships in September last year, and also plays rugby for Tonbridge Juddians club. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A 15-year-old boy has been airlifted to hospital after accidentally shooting himself in the head. 'The boy had been shooting rabbits on land at his family home in Speldhurst near Tunbridge Wells when the incident occurred. 'The boy had been reported missing at 8.30pm after failing to return to the family home which sparked a search operation by officers. 'He was found shortly after 9pm with a gunshot wound to his head.' The spokesman said the teenager was airlifted to hospital to receive treatment. 'The shotgun he was using was found nearby and has been made safe,' he added. The Rev Douglas Wren, vicar at St Mary's Church in the village of Speldhurst, said: 'The family live close to me. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. 'They're clearly a family in distress at the moment and we will be praying for them. 'I really know little more about the details of how the accident happened as I haven't spoken to the family yet,' he said.","Blaise Fenn, 15, was shooting rabbits on land at his family home in Kent .

Caught: Christopher Maffei, 43, surrendered while allegedly attempting to flee with his two children he kidnapped from their mother . Two children were rescued Friday from a sailboat that was stolen by their father accused of abducting them from their mother's home in Central California, authorities said. The Coast Guard, FBI and South San Francisco police had been tracking the 40-foot sailboat Unleashed, which was sailed from a harbor in Alameda on Tuesday. Police said earlier that day, Christopher Maffei, 43, had removed his 3-year-old daughter Brooklynn and 2-year-old son Devin from their mother's home while she was out. The children's rescue came hours after the guard spent most of Friday following the boat as it slowly sailed down the rugged central California coastline. Chief Petty Officer Mike Lutz said a guard airplane followed the boat south to Monterey Bay, where the rescue occurred. 'A Coast Guard cutter approached the vessel and just started talking to them,' Coast Guard spokesman Thomas McKenzie said. 'He put his hands up and surrendered without incident.' Maffei's daughter Brooklynn and son Devin were being examined by medical personnel and would be reunited with their mother, McKenzie said. Found: Brooklyn, aged three, left, was allegedly taken from her mother's home along with her baby brother Devin, aged two, right . Escape: Maffei was found on this stolen sailboat, a white Hunter 41, he had shown interest in buying last week . Maffei is the former boyfriend of the children's mother, Jennifer Hipon. She told reporters that she was at a courthouse filing custody documents on Tuesday when Maffei went to her house and took the children from her elderly mother. South San Francisco police say that after running off with the children, Maffei drove to the harbor in Alameda and left on the 40-foot sailboat. He sailed the boat out the Golden Gate, and headed down the coast, police said. San Francisco police said Maffei had visited the owner of the stolen yacht with his two children two weeks ago to ask about buying it and to inspect the vessel. A fisherman spotted the sailboat off the San Mateo County coast on Friday, and law enforcement started a slow-speed chase as they tried to intercept the vessel, police said. McKenzie said the stolen boat was recovered and would be returned to its owner. Destination? The children's mother believed Maffei may have been trying to sail towards Mexico where he talked about taking his two children on holiday . Hideout: According to the children's mother, Maffei may have also been planning to take them to Thailand, where he previously used to work . The children's distraught mother Jenifer Nipon believed Maffei was trying to possibly head to Thailand where he has lived previously or to Mexico where he previously talked about taking Brooklynn and Devin on holiday. She told the San Mateo County Times: 'I . want the Coast Guard. The Navy. Anybody who has a boat. Please look for . my children and bring them back to me. I am afraid for my children's . lives. 'He got a sailboat and he's somewhere out there in the ocean. I am not sure where he is right now.' She told BC7 News: 'I'm afraid if they back him into a corner. I just don't want him to snap and do something really stupid more than what he's already done, so I'm just really worried for my kids and I just want them to come back home to me safe and unharmed.'","Christopher Maffei, 43, is accused of abducting his two children Brooklynn, three, and Devin, two, from their mother's home in San Francisco .

Most of us have spent long uncomfortable nights being kept awake by a raucous party at a neighbour's house or flat. But while the majority will have just buried their head under the duvet and shut all the windows, one Londoner decided to put his inability to sleep to good use and compile a detailed critique of the 'terrible' karaoke that disturbed him. Oli Beale then pinned a giant newspaper-style review to the board in the communal area of his Hackney block of flats and then posted a picture on Twitter. Scathing review: Oli Beale pinned a giant newspaper-style review to the board in the communal area of his Hackney block of flats and then posted a picture on Twitter . His handmade complaint included timings and titles of songs sung, how it was performed and a rating out of 10. After the 'singing/screaming' finished at 9.10am, his final message to his east London neighbours was simply: 'I hate you'. The 33-year-old, who works in advertising, wrote to the mystery group who did the 'epic performance' on a balcony in the middle of the night. 'Your terrace faces 115 windows so you really did have the perfect stage. I'm sure you are keen to hear our verdict,' he wrote. First up was The Who's classic Pinball Wizard, which received a 'terrible' three out of ten at 2.23am. At 3.14am was Aerosmith's duet with Run DMC: Walk This Way, which Mr Beale gave a 1 in ten and called 'the lowest point of the performance' and its chorus was repeated every ten minutes for the rest of the night, he said. No stars: Oli said the performances of Aerosmith's Walk This Way and Elton John's Tiny Dancer weren't good . At 8.20am there was Elton John's balled Tiny Dancer, which was 'actually very good - if you're going to be woken up after only two hours sleep  it might as well be to a herd of morons screaming Tiny Dancer'. The finale came at 9.10am with The Cure's single Friday I'm in Love, which was a 'return to poor form'. Quoting its famous first line 'I don't care if Monday's blue' Mr Beale added: 'Judging by how wired you all looked by this stage, I can assure you Monday through to Thuirsday  will be very, very blue.' Oli, after reviewing Friday I'm In Love, finished his missive with the words, 'I hate you' It is not the first time Mr Beale's creative complaints have captured the imagination. Three years ago he wrote to Sir Richard Branson about poor food on his Virgin flight, which was called the funniest complaint letter of all time. He was so furious about his meal between Mumbai and London he sent six-pages of complaints with pictures of his food. He called it his 'culinary journey of . hell' and asked Sir Richard to consider how he had felt as a child when he opened Christmas presents, saying: 'It's your hamster Richard.

After raised as a military kid, joining her school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps or ROTC and earning a full-ride Air Force scholarship to Marquette University, enlisting to serve her country was a dream. What she didn't expect was that weeks before commissioned as a second lieutenant, with her own father in uniform proudly swearing her in, she'd become pregnant. Scroll down for video . Proudest day: Pictured beside her father Capt Tony Edmonds in one of her proudest moments, Rebecca Edmonds graduated from Marquette University last year on full scholarship from the Air Force . Secret: It was at this ceremony the enrolling second lieutenant held a dangerous secret from her soon-to-be commanding officers, she was 13 weeks pregnant . 'It was very special,' Ms Edmonds recalled to CNN of her college graduation ceremony in July of 2011 having completed a degree in nursing. 'I was so happy that [my parents] had an opportunity to come out and be a part of that ceremony and have him administer the oath of office to me as an active-duty officer,' she said of her father, Capt Tony Edmonds. But when sitting down for one of her final counselling sessions with an officer before her commission, it was then her excitement turned to nervousness. She had only just found out she was 13 weeks pregnant and no one outside of her immediate family and her boyfriend knew. Fearful: With the military having been in her life from the start, following in her father's footsteps before joining ROTC, as seen centre, Ms Edmonds was scared to tell others of her pregnancy for fear of it ruining her dreams . Uncertainty: When an officer allegedly warned that if she became pregnant it would end badly, she said she felt trapped, though already knew she would never have an abortion . Shock: Ms Edmonds says she was shocked to hear that she had three options of getting married, giving her child to adoption or having an abortion, the last option she said only dictated in private to her . 'He says, ""I don't know what would happen to a cadet if she were to become pregnant. But I don't think it would be good. So just don't get pregnant,""' Ms Edmonds recalled of their conversation. 'He said that word for word to me. At . that point, I thought, ""OK, I don't think I have to tell anybody this,” she said, describing herself from then on rather 'scared.' - Ms Edmonds of her officer . Moving forward, Ms Edmonds said she completed all of her physical and academic requirements. Being a Catholic, she said abortion was never an option for her. Instead she began planning her move to Virginia to begin her service. Once six months in, however, she felt she had to tell someone. With her news, first expressed as no . issue by her immediate commanders, she was accused of committing fraud . for having not reported changes in her medical status, 'for example, . pregnancy,' as her ROTC contract signed in 2007 read. She was disenrolled. Kicked out: Six months into her pregnancy with this little boy, Ms Edmonds revealed her news to her officers in effect dis-enrolling her while accusing her of fraud for having not reported it before . Fighting: Ms Edmonds, seen today holding her 10-month-old boy beside her boyfriend, says that she is fighting her removal under a military rule that refuses to enlist single mothers . Claiming to have questioned her officer who warned her of her ejection from the Air Force, she asked: 'Had I terminated the pregnancy before my commissioning, would I have been able to commission at that point?' According to Ms Edmonds: 'He said, ""well, technically, yes."" A spokesman for the Air Force to CNN denied knowing of that conversation taking place.' Any such counselling would have been inappropriate and I have seen no evidence of any such discussion,' Maj. Joel Harper wrote to CNN. 'However, Ms. Edmonds' case is under review by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records.' Debt to pay: Now having a $92,000 debt from student loans, her Air Force scholarship taken away, Ms Edmonds works as a pediatric nurse . Appealing to her congressman and hiring an attorney, Ms Edmonds learned that if she weren't a single mother before her commissioning, the Air Force's decision would have been far more lenient toward her. As military readiness goes, single parents don't have flexibility to serve in all times of need, they stated. '...she would have been able to commission if she were not a single parent, for example, if she were married, or had given the child up for adoption,' Air Force Colonel Kelly Goggin wrote to ms Edmonds' congressman. Needed at home: The Air Force has said that single moms are not eligible for enrollment because of their inability to be ready in time of need . Mistake: She says that having her son Dominic, pictured, was never a mistake but hopes the military soon realizes that they are making one themselves . Today, working as a paediatric nurse, Ms Edmonds owes the military $92,000 for her tuition but says she's paying it in increments of $100 a month, with interest. While the Air Force had been her life before, and to a large degree still is, she says it's now her 10-month old son, Dominic whom she says was never a mistake. Still though she hopes like the recent changes allowing openly gay men and women to serve in the U.S. military, change will come or even be considered for her one day. ‘I believe a woman has the right to choose life, go on to serve and reach [her] full potential, including being an officer in the Air Force,’ Ms Edmonds told CNN.

Ed Balls was heckled by union activists yesterday after supporting the Government’s decision to impose a pay freeze on state workers. Speaking at the Trades Union Congress, the Shadow Chancellor faced shouts of ‘shame on you’ after admitting he would not reverse the freeze. Later the TUC voted overwhelmingly to start planning the ‘practicalities’ of the first general strike in Britain since 1926. Scroll down to see the video . Labour's Ed Balls told the TUC conference in Brighton that securing jobs was more important than big pay rises for the public sector . Mr Balls, who is a member of the two . biggest unions, Unite and Unison, refused to support the clamour from . the party’s union backers to reject the pay freeze. Public sector workers who earn . £21,000 or more are subject to a two-year freeze, while local government . workers are subject to a three-year freeze. Official figures show the average . public sector worker with a full-time job earns £28,668, compared with . £24,787 in the private sector. During a question-and-answer session . at the annual conference in Brighton, the biggest cheer went to Liz . Cameron, 49, a youth services worker from Salford, who criticised Mr . Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband for supporting the freeze, and spoke . of the daily struggle she faces to make ends meet. Mrs Cameron, who has . four children, said thousands of care workers, dinner ladies and . teaching assistants were in a similar situation to her. She said: ‘What is the response from . our Labour Party? Why is it we hear you [Ed Balls] and Ed Miliband talk . about supporting this Tory pay freeze when I’m having to make hardline . decisions. Unions are threatening more strike action in opposition to the government's spending cuts and job losses. ‘We are fighting to makes ends meet. No new school uniform, whether or not I can pay my heating bills, . whether or not I can choose to buy food. ‘How on earth do you expect to get . the support of hundreds of thousands of public service workers when you . continue to repeat that position?’ But Mr Balls ignored her plea, . insisting that the pay freeze is the only sensible option during the . longest and deepest downturn for more than a century, prompting jeers . from union members. ‘When you are losing hundreds of . thousands of jobs, we can’t with credibility say the first priority is . more pay for existing workers when hundreds of thousands of people are . losing their jobs,’ he said. ‘That is the reality. I want things to be . done in a fairer way but I don’t think we can argue pay before jobs. We . have got to say jobs before pay.’ Mr Balls, who joked about his status . as one of Britain’s most annoying MPs, also criticised the plans by . unions to co-ordinate devastating strike action in the coming months. He said: ‘I’m sure the last thing . that the vast majority of trade union members want at times of such . uncertainty in our economy is strikes. It is not what we want. It is not . what the public want.’ 'We are at our best fighting back' Steve Turner, executive policy director of Unite . Mr Balls added: ‘When Coalition . ministers warn they will have to act and legislate if they are to see a . return to the unrest of the 1980s what we are really seeing is Tories . itching to provoke a row about strikes so they can blame the stalling . recovery on trade union members and working people.’ But later, after a heated debate, . union members cheered enthusiastically after controversially agreeing to . start plotting the logistics of a nationwide walkout in protest at . spending cuts. If it goes ahead, a general strike . would wipe out vital services, with workers including teachers, prison . guards, firemen,  nurses, dinner ladies and paramedics likely to walk . out. Yesterday’s vote is a huge . embarrassment for Labour as the motion was supported by its biggest . donor, Unite.

A sister is testing the bounds of sibling sacrifice - she is a surrogate for her brother and sister-in-law by carrying their twin sons. Tiffany Burke volunteered to give birth to children for her brother after his wife had to undergo an emergency hysterectomy. Mrs Burke's sister-in-law Natalie Lucich, who is married to Mrs Burke's brother James, had to have her uterus removed immediately after giving birth to her son Hunter. Modern family: Tiffany Burke (center left) is the sister of James Lucich (right) and she told her sister-in-law Natalie (center right) that she would serve as a surrogate. Tiffany's husband Sean (left) signed off as well . Growing: Natalie (right) had an emergency hysterectomy while giving birth to her son Hunter (center right) and afterwards Tiffany (center left) offered to serve as the couple's surrogate when they wanted to have more children . After Hunter's delivery, doctors could not stem the bleeding and had to remove the womb. In the weeks immediately following the operation, Natalie told CNN that she was increasingly saddened - though understanding that the life-saving move had to be done - that she would not be able to fulfil her dream of having three children naturally. When she voiced these complaints to her sister-in-law, who herself was a mother of two, Natalie said that perhaps they would use a surrogate. 'Honestly, I was pissed!' Tiffany wrote on her blog that she used to chronicle the family's unusual story. 'What if the surrogate drank, or smoked, or threw herself down the stairs! How do you trust someone like that with your baby!  No way, no WAY!' Without a moment's hesitation, she offered to serve as the surrogate for her brother and sister-in-law, and after several months of discussions between the Lucichs and Burke and her husband, all of the parties agreed and began the biological and legal processes associated with surrogacy. The Washington-based relatives used fertility center Seattle Reproductive Medicine to help them take Natalie's conveniently frozen eggs and her husband's sperm to create two embryos. Supportive: Tiffany, who has two sons of her own including her youngest named Blake (right), said that her family has all signed off . Controversial choice: Even though James and Tiffany were both adopted, the Lucichs (pictured) did not feel comfortable doing so when they wanted to expand their family . Two rounds with two embryos apiece resulted in Tiffany eventually being impregnated with the twins. By documenting their journey explicitly on their blog and speaking to CNN, the group have tried to dispel common questions about the increasingly popular practice. Given the fact that Tiffany and James are siblings, the question of incest comes up frequently but that is one that they are quick to shoot down. 'This is in no way shape or form incest. Tiffany's eggs are dormant during inception, and not used in this process. The embryos are already embryos - the start of life - before even being put in Tiffany. They are 100% James and Natalie's. Tiffany is truly just the carrier, the oven if you will,' she wrote on the blog. 'As an interesting side note, our situation is even more different since James and Tiffany were both adopted at birth, from different birth parents. They are not even blood related although it would not matter if they were. Tiffany would have done this for her biological brother as well. This is no different than a sister carrying for a sister.' Another question that bothers Tiffany is why the couple went through the process of having another child if they already had a healthy baby boy, and on top of that, why not adopt? 'Our family is very pro adoption since James, Tiffany and another one of their siblings, Jonathan, are all adopted. The process for adoption is similar to surrogacy, long and hard and expensive,' she wrote. 'When my husband and I told everyone we wanted to have another baby, no one said, ""You already have a child, you should be grateful for that."" We conceived naturally and no one batted an eye, our second son was welcome with open arms and no judgement. So why is this any different?'","Tiffany Burke, mother of two, offered to be the surrogate for her sister-in-law Natalie Lucich, who is married to Burke's brother James .

"Valley Stream sits just north east of John F Kennedy airport . By . Victoria Wellman . PUBLISHED: . 13:08 EST, 11 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:42 EST, 11 September 2012 . The residents of two Long Island homes were woken at 3.30am on Sunday by a calamitous crashing noise as large and heavy debris of some kind fell through both their roofs. Neighbours Lois Farella and Anne Grace of Valley Stream now have gaping holes in their roofs the cause of which is believed to be frozen waste - known as 'blue ice' - that most likely leaked from a passing aircraft. The FAA is investigating the possibility that a plane's faulty sewage tank might be responsible for the damage done to the shingles, the plywood and even the layer of insulation of the houses. Write caption here . 'It's a very huge hole. It did a lot of damage through heavy wood. I can't imagine if it hit a person,' Ms Grace told CBS of the destruction caused on her home. Her elderly neighbour who now has a basketball-sized hole in her own roof, recalled: 'We both woke up to a very loud bang. I looked around - no breeze, no rain, nothing.' Roofer Bryan Lanzello discovered a wet, brown stain inside the attic below the large fissure in Ms Grace's roof and said he couldn't imagine what, other than something from a plane, could have fallen that hard and fast. Valley Stream sits just north east of John F Kennedy airport so planes probably fly overhead frequently. Write caption here . Crater: The hole in Lois Farella's roof is roughly the shape of a basketball . Debris: Whatever came through the roof penetrated not only shingles but plywood and insulation too so must have been heavy or dropped from a great height . 'That's a lot of blunt force that did . that [and it] was coming from a distance. It blew through and inch and a . half of shingles and those shingles are tough,' he remarked. But the FAA claims on its website that reports of such incidents are rarely anything at all to do with air traffic and that brown stains could easily be attributed to large groups of migrating birds laying waste en route. In a fact sheet the Federal Aviation Administration address a list of what it refers to as 'myths' surrounding the subject, debunking the notion that planes routinely dump sewage in mid-flight. 'Manufacturers take great care to ensure this holding tank is secure,' it reads. 'It's physically impossible for a pilot to dump a tank while in flight. The apparatus to access the tank is located on the exterior of the plane. Mystery: The FAA are investigating but say that reports of such incidents are rarely anything to do with aeroplane waste as often as they are the migrating birds dropping feces . Hygiene: Aeroplane bathrooms like this one use a blue coloured deodorising chemical in the toilet bowl that also breaks down solids . 'That exterior lever means only the ground crew can operate the valve that opens the tank while the plane is on the ground. 'Even if the tank were to break it goes on, 'blue ice', named for the colour of the disinfectant liquid in plane toilet bowls, would not land in solid form. 'Modern commercial aircraft cruise at high altitudes, and the sub-zero temperatures will cause any liquid to freeze immediately, hence the term ""Blue Ice,""' the site clarifies before adding,  'If any of this ""Blue Ice"" were to fall from an aircraft, it would melt long before it hit the ground, dissipating into miniscule droplets that are nearly invisible.' According to the FAA, phone calls claiming to report craters caused by 'blue ice' increase dramatically around Fall when birds begin to migrate. Conclusions: Roofer, Bryan Lanzello discovered a wet, brown stain inside the attic below the large frissure in Ms Grace's roof and said he couldn't imagine what else could have caused the damage . Home sweet home: The FAA will check to see if any planes passed over Anne Grace's Valley Streams neighbourhood on Sunday night . No shelter here: Lois Farella says now she has been told she has to get an entirely new roof which could cost thousands of dollars . 'Bird migration also occurs during a time when fruit trees are ripening,' claims the FAA in a final attempt to put claims of falling feces to rest.  'As the fruit goes through a bird's digestive system it loses none of its color, which means if it was blue going in, it will be blue coming out.' Authorities, have been looking into what might have caused the damage in Long Island and comparing the timing to the flight schedule over the area on Sunday night. If there were planes passing overhead at 3.30 am then they will have to investigate further to find out which airline may be at fault for having a tank in disrepair. An FAA spokesman said that at this time, the case was 'inclusive'. Arlene Salac told MailOnline: We couldn't determine if it was blue ice as radar tracks from the area showed there were no planes overhead at the time the residents said the debris fell. 'The nearest plane was three miles away. There is no blue residue and no sign of aircraft parts around the house. Unless it happened at a different time of day or we get more information we cannot tell what happened'","Damage is believed to have been made by falling 'blue ice' - the name given to frozen airplane sewage .

Accused: William MacKenzie, who has 30 years of experience handling birds of prey, outside Shrewsbury Magistrates Court . A pensioner who kept owls and hawks was filmed by neighbours kicking and punching the birds of prey in his back garden, a court heard. William MacKenzie, 68, is also accused of threatening the birds - including three owls and a hawk - with a petrol-powered lawnmower. MacKenzie denied 10 animal welfare charges when he appeared at Shrewsbury Magistrates Court on Tuesday. The court heard neighbours filmed him brutally attacking the birds of prey in the back garden of his home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, last June. Shocking footage appeared to show bearded MacKenzie striking and kicking several birds of prey, including a snowy owl and an African spotted eagle owl. MacKenzie, who has 30 years of experience handling birds of prey, claimed he cared for the birds which had been abandoned or injured by cars. He said: 'These owls were like my family. 'They were like my children and it was very difficult when these birds were taken from me. 'I would never punch or kick these birds, I would rather punch or kick a human being to any animal.' But prosecution witness Neil Forbes, a veterinary surgeon and expert in avian medicine, said he had never seen a falconer behave in this manner to birds of prey. He told the court: 'In my opinion they are not just suffering physically but also suffering distress and anxiety. 'I don’t not see any justification for treating a bird in this way. 'This is physical aggression and damage to the bird and I can see no place in modern day training or handling for this sort of behaviour.' The court also saw footage of MacKenzie using a petrol-powered lawnmower to cut the grass just inches from where several owls and a Harris hawk were perched. The footage appeared to show the birds trying to fly away in distress. Trial: Shrewsbury Magistrates Court, where the hearing was held on Tuesday . Mr Forbes added: 'Both barn owls are flying away from the noise and the proximity of the lawnmower. 'It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the birds are worried, surely you would put them away. I’m not sure if it’s sheer laziness of total lack of care.' But MacKenzie argued other noises had not frightened the birds, whom he claimed were used to the sound of the lawnmower.

He has proved he is absolutely brilliant with a tennis racket but when it comes to dealing with the luggage, Andy Murray leaves that to his girlfriend Kim Sears. The US Open champion has arrived back on British soil to cheers following his historic win in New York on Monday night and was mobbed by fans. The tennis ace flew into Heathrow’s Terminal 5 at around 9am with girlfriend Kim and was greeted by British Airways staff and excited members of the public. Murray, dressed in jeans and a hooded . top, was photographed by waiting media and posed for pictures with . holidaymakers and airport staff as he collected his luggage. Coming through! Kim Sears is left to struggle with Andy Murray's luggage trolley as the pair arrive back into Heathrow Airport this morning after his sensational US Open win . But it was left to Kim to wheel the trolley while the Scot took the plaudits for becoming the first British man in 76 years to win a major singles title when he beat Novak Djokovic over five sets in the US Open final. However, it is claimed that his loyal girlfriend's love and support over the past seven years will be rewarded, as Andy could be set to propose. A source close to Murray said he would be taking a few days out following his arrival in London. He will take some time to rest and 'get his head right' before deciding what to do next, the source said. Champion: Murray arrives back at Terminal 5 and was mobbed by fans and journalists keen to speak to him . Murray admitted before leaving New York that he was not sure what reaction his new status would bring on his return. He said: 'It's something that will probably take a bit of getting used to. It's not something I've always been that comfortable with. 'I spoke to (coach) Ivan (Lendl) a couple of times during the year and he asked me, 'What worries you?'. 'I said that I worry what might happen if I win a major, how my life might change, because I want it to be the same. 'He said he felt the same thing but all that happens is you get more people congratulating you and you get nicer tables in restaurants and to play on all the good golf courses for free.' VIP: The British number one was tackled as soon as he landed to find out how he feels to be home . Slam winner: Andy left Kim with the luggage, right, as he was surrounded on the concourse of terminal 5 . Murray has laughed off talk of a knighthood but the question of how Britain will honour the champion remains. A golden post box already stands in his hometown of Dunblane following his victory at the Olympics, and his local authority is in talks to offer him the Freedom of the City of Stirling . 'The whole community will want to congratulate Andy on his first gland slam title and on the glorious, warrior-like way he won it,' said Stirling Provost councillor Mike Robbins. The Scot's odds of becoming BBC Sports Personality of the Year have, meanwhile, been slashed.Murray will next compete at the Japan Open on October 1, according to the schedule on his official website. He will be defending the title after beating Spaniard Rafael Nadal in Tokyo last year, where he also took a victory in the doubles tournament alongside older brother Jamie. Proud: Kim Sears looks at hero Andy, who is rumoured to be about to propose to his long-term girlfriend . The US win completed a successful few months for the 25-year-old, who followed a Wimbledon final with Olympic gold. Following his US victory Murray hailed the effect Britain’s magical sporting summer has had on the country. He said yesterday: “Being around the Olympics and seeing how the nation came together, from the public to the athletes to the press, everyone was just right behind it. 'Sport has been this huge part of my life since I was a kid and it’s been the best summer of sport in my lifetime and I’m sure in most people’s. It’s been so much fun and I’m just happy I was able to contribute towards it.' Wedding bells? Andy Murray stayed on soft drinks as he and girlfriend Kim Sears celebrated his victory with a meal at New York's Hakkasan restaurant . It is not yet known whether Murray will take part in a parade for Scotland’s Olympic athletes in Glasgow on Friday. With his thrilling five-set US Open victory, Andy Murray is assured of a place in the tennis history books. His epic triumph also brings the promise of more immediate material rewards, however. Experts yesterday predicted that by ending the nation's 76-year wait for a Grand Slam men's singles champion, Murray's career earnings could now top £100million – making him one of Britain's richest sports superstars. In love: Andy Murray with his girlfriend Kim Sears and the trophy at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in the Flushing neighbourhood of New York . Andy Murray kisses Kim Sears after Murray defeated Roger Federer at the 2012 Summer Olympics . His four-hour, 54-minute win over Novak Djokovic was worth almost £1.2million in prize money alone. But that will be dwarfed by the riches set to flood into the 25-year-old's bank account. Coupled with his Olympic Gold medal-winning defeat of Roger Federer last month, the US Open result will see major international sponsors clamour for a piece of 'Brand Murray'. The importance of Murray's commercial interests was clear to see immediately after the match had concluded, when Murray looked agitated as he tried to find a watch provided by one of his sponsors. On-court microphones caught the British number one saying 'I don't have it, I don't have it' as he pointed at his wrist. You can do it! Kim Sears urges on Murray during his epic five setter .

Limping in pain, he called out from the court to his girlfriend Kim Sears, who was wearing an expensive-looking timepiece herself: 'Have you got my watch? I don't have my watch.' Luckily for the tennis star, the watch - a Rado D-Star Automatic Chronograph worth £2,580 - was found in time for him to wear it as he received the trophy. Only three months ago, he was announced as an ambassador for watchmakers Rado - a sponsorship deal reportedly worth a seven-figure sum. Speaking after the match, Murray was full of relief. Despite his Olympics triumph in London last month, the boy from Dunblane was the underdog heading into the match, having lost in four Grand Slam tournament finals.

Glittering prize: Andy Murray became the first British grand slam winner in 76 years, beating Novak Djokovic at the US Open on Monday .

'Right now, there's a lot of relief and I'm still buzzing a bit from the match - the atmosphere out there was unbelievable,' he said. 'It would have been a tough one to lose so I'm so, so happy I managed to pull though in the end. 'The body's hurting a bit but it was worth it.' The windy conditions helped Murray in the early stages but Djokovic fought back once it had started to die down. However, the Scot revealed he took a toilet break before the start of the decider to regain his composure.

'I was still playing the same way as when it was windy and I was kind of guiding the ball a little bit and was only reaching the middle of the court. 'At the beginning of the fifth set I went to the toilet and I said to myself: ""For one set, just give it everything you've got"". 'I got lucky in the first game with a net on the break point but I settled down after that.' His early considerable lead, and a chance at history, slipping away, Murray dug deep for stamina and mental strength in an effort to outlast his Serbian rival. 'Novak is so, so strong. He fights until the end in every single match,' Murray said.

A damning report has revealed the Department for Transport was biased against Sir Richard Branson's bid to continue running the West Coast mainline . The Transport Department was biased against Sir Richard Branson’s bid to continue running the West Coast mainline, a damning interim report into the fiasco reveals today. The independent investigation into the scandal highlights ‘significant errors’, ‘weak governance’, and a ‘flawed process’ in which ‘bidders were treated inconsistently’. The contract to run the West Coast mainline franchise for 13 years was originally awarded to First Group over Virgin. However, a legal challenge by Sir Richard cited significant flaws in the process forced the Government to abandon the decision and re-run the bidding. The findings vindicate charges by Virgin and others revealed in the Daily Mail that there was an in-built bias against the Virgin bid which has been characterised as ‘ABB’, or ‘Anyone But Branson’. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin last night accepted the damning findings of widespread ‘flaws’ in the way the rival bids by loser Virgin and winner First Group were handled by his department. But while conceding they made ‘uncomfortable reading’, he insisted there was nothing in the report to blame ministers - putting the onus firmly on his civil servants. However, Labour’s spokesman on transport Maria Eagle named Mr McLoughlin, his predecessor Justine Greening, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond who also headed the Transport Department, and former transport minister Theresa Villiers, as serving Cabinet ministers with their ‘fingerprints’ on the fiasco. She said: ‘This isn’t just a faulty process, it’s a faulty Government.’ Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, who headed the independent investigation into the scandal cites a number of ‘contributory factors’ which added to the . franchise fiasco – including ‘lack of clarity’, lack of leadership, . lack of continuity in senior leadership roles, and officials being in . too much of a hurry without sufficient planning or preparation. These follow . cut backs in the department which have left staff ‘stretched’ when also . dealing with other major projects. The right to continue to run the West Coast mainline franchise from this winter was originally awarded to First Group – until a legal challenge by Sir Richard forced the Government earlier this month to abandon the decision and re-run the bidding after identifying serious flaws in the process. The highly critical Laidlaw report blames: . Mr Laidlaw said: 'My strong initial . view is that a number of factors operating together, caused or at least . contributed to the flaws.' 'There is a body of evidence that strongly suggests that the DfT’s . evaluation of the financial robustness of bids in the Inter City West . Coast (ICWC) franchise process was developed late, in a hurry and . without proper planning and preparation.' Organisational changes within the department ‘resulted in a lack of . clarity’. ’Key members of the franchise team were relatively junior and . inexperienced in comparison with the bidder representatives they were . facing.’ Labour shadow Miss Eagle said: 'Ministers must not be allowed to shuffle . off responsibility - not my words but the words of the Prime Minister. This isn't just a faulty process, it's a faulty Government.' 'Not one but four members of the . Prime Minister's Cabinet and it's about time they took responsibility . for it instead of blaming officials.' The right to continue to run the West Coast mainline franchise from this winter was originally awarded to First Group - until a legal challenge by Sir Richard . Sir Richard Branson said Whitehall . had accepted that First Group’s successful £7billion bid for the 15-year . franchise was ‘five times riskier’ than Virgin’s by demanding a . £200million guarantee – compared to just £40million demanded of Virgin. But if the Department had properly followed its rules, the Government should have demanded a £600million security, he said. The independent investigation into the scandal by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, pictured, highlights 'significant errors' Mr McLoughlin told MPs: ’To be blunt, . these initial findings make uncomfortable reading. But they they provide . a necessary and welcome further step to sorting this out.’ He said: 'It is clear that the . Inquiry has identified a number of issues which confirm that my decision . to cancel the franchise competition was necessary. ‘These include the lack of . transparency in the bidding process; the fact that published guidance . was not complied with when bids were being processed; inconsistencies in . the treatment of bidders; and confirmation of technical flaws in the . model used to calculate the amount of  risk capital bidders were asked . to provide to guard against the risk of default.’ But he also told MPs:'It’s an interim report. Nowhere does it criticise ministers.’ A further report, with firm conclusions, is expected by the end of November. Labour’s Miss Eagle urged Prime . Minister David Cameron to make sure his ministers take responsibility . for the cancellation of the bidding process for the new franchise, which . collapsed several weeks ago shortly before FirstGroup signed a contract . for the deal. Mr McLoughlin was updating MPs on an . interim report into the affair, which is set to cost taxpayers at least . £40 million in refunding costs to the bidding firms, Virgin Rail and . First Group. But Miss Eagle said experts said the . full cost of re-working all the affected franchises would be in excess . of £100million and demanded to know how much. She said: 'Do you agree ministers must . take responsibility for serious or systematic performance failures, . flawed policy and poor design? 'Ministers must not be allowed to . shuffle off responsibility - not my words but the words of the Prime . Minister. This isn't just a faulty process, it's a faulty Government.' In August, the DfT announced that . transport giant FirstGroup, rather than Sir Richard Branson's rail . company Virgin Trains, had won the battle to operate a new 13-year West . Coast franchise. Sir Richard, whose company had run . West Coast since 1997, dubbed the bidding process ‘insane’ and launched . a legal challenge to the decision. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured, today accepted in full the interim findings of widespread 'flaws' in the way the rival bids by loser Virgin and winner First Group were handled by his department . Former transport secretary Justine . Greening, who presided over the original FirstGroup decision, and her . successor, Mr McLoughlin, both defended the bidding process. But it was while preparing to . defend the Branson court challenge that mistakes in managing the West . Coast bidding process were found. Mr McLoughlin scrapped the bidding and . suspended bidding on other franchises. In addition, three DfT civil . servants were suspended. Mr McLoughlin also announced that two . independent inquiries would be carried out - the first to look . specifically at the West Coast bidding process and the other to . investigate franchise bidding generally. FirstGroup had been due to take over . the London to Scotland West Coast route on December 9. Virgin has been . asked to carry on for the time being, with a two-year interim franchise . to be offered later followed by a longer, permanent franchise. In addition to Virgin and FirstGroup, two other companies had bid to run West Coast. FirstGroup which was stripped of . the franchise when the flaws welcomed confirmation that it was ‘in no . way at fault’, having acted entirely in accordance with the DfT's . process throughout but added: 'Nevertheless we are extremely disappointed . and dissatisfied that, as a result of Government's reversal of its . decision, taxpayers and West Coast passengers will not benefit from the . better deal that our strong bid would have delivered.’ Derogatory emails about Sir Richard . Branson’s Virgin Trains were allegedly sent between civil servants. The messages were between a dozen . staff at the Department for Transport, which has been accused of . allowing the development of a culture characterised as ‘ABB – Anyone But . Branson’. The Government awarded the new . £7billion franchise to FirstGroup, but cancelled it before the planned . handover in December after Sir Richard’s Virgin group, which offered . £700million less, made a successful legal challenge on the grounds that . the Government ‘got its sums wrong’. An insider revealed: ‘There is . electronic e-mail traffic between the officials. In some of them Virgin . is referred to in derogatory terms. Some people sent these messages, . others received them.’ Virgin executives had long been . concerned about the perception of an ‘anti-Virgin’ bias and culture . within the department characterised as ‘Anyone But Branson’. Industry insiders said Whitehall . officials – some of whom had worked for more traditional train operators . – disliked the firm’s maverick approach. There was allegedly deep . resentment when Virgin renegotiated the terms of the West Coast . franchise in 2006 on terms which ‘nailed them to the floor’. ‘Some people in the department felt they were stitched up,’ said one source. ‘It’s a catalogue of calamities.’ Three civil servants have been suspended by the Departmernt as a result of the fiasco. But one of them, Kate Mingay, the . department's commercial and technical services director, issued a . statement through her lawyers shortly after her suspension saying her . role in the West Coast process had been ‘inaccurately portrayed mainly . due to statements and other comment made by the Department for Transport . itself’. She added: ‘I would like to make it . clear that I did not have lead responsibility for this project and that . neither I nor any member of my team had any responsibility for the . economic modelling for this project, or for any DfT project. ‘Nor did I have any responsibility for . the financial modelling in respect of this project and I have not been . involved in briefing DfT ministers or other Government ministers in . respect of this project.’","Report accuses ministers of trying to pass the buck onto their civil servants .

New team: The cast of Yes, Prime Minister (left to right) Zoe Telford, David Haig, Henry Goodman and Chris Larkin launch the show, which will be on next year . The Thick of It’s Zoe Telford will play her. Stage actor Henry Goodman, who is Cabinet Secretary Sir Humphrey, said she is a challenge to him. He told the Independent: ‘He's up against a woman and has to negotiate with her by wearing kid gloves - and he's not used to doing that.’ David Haig, from Two Weeks Notice, plays Prime Minister Jim Hacker and Chris Larkin is Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley. Haig said the series is in ‘an up-to-date political environment’ but still has similar issues such as Europe, growth rates and 'political shenanigans'.

A U.S. citizen sentenced to 22 years in prison in Nicaragua on drug-trafficking charges walked out of jail a free man on Thursday after his conviction was thrown out by an appeals court in a case that rallied international rights activists. Jason Puracal, 35, left La Modelo prison in Tipitapa, just east of the capital, Managua, on Thursday afternoon after the appeals court that heard his case last month ordered he be set free. Puracal was found guilty of drug trafficking and money laundering by a Nicaraguan trial judge last year, along with 10 Nicaraguan co-defendants, after being detained in 2010. He has maintained his innocence. Free to go: U.S. citizen Jason Puracal sits in a car after his release from prison at Tipitapa town in Managua Thursday . Optimistic: Puracal, left, pictured in August, attends his appeals hearing in handcuffs in Granada, Nicaragua; he was jailed for nearly two years on money-laundering and drug charges in Nicaragua . A prison guard records a video with a cell phone during an appeal hearing for U.S. citizen Jason Puracal in Granada, Nicaragua in August . The appeals court ordered that the trial be annulled because the judge did not substantiate the reasons for his ruling, and excluded evidence defence attorneys wanted to present. Puracal's immediate fate was unclear. A person familiar with the case told Reuters that Puracal was restricted from leaving Managua. The source voiced concern that Puracal would be rearrested by Nicaraguan authorities. Before Puracal was released, Nicaraguan Attorney General Julio Centeno told a local television station that his office was considering whether to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, the nation's highest judicial body. 'We have been fighting for this moment for two years, and it is an amazing feeling to know that the appellate court has recognized what the rest of the world recognized a long time ago, and that is that Jason is innocent,' Puracal's sister, Janis Puracal, said by telephone. Puracal emerged from the prison behind his co-defendants, who were also released under the court order. He was then taken in a motorcade to Managua, although his exact destination was unknown. Members of the media were not allowed to approach Puracal as he left. Representatives for the family told reporters that he would not be making any public statements or doing media interviews for the foreseeable future. Puracal's attorney, Fabbrith Gómez, said he would be meeting privately with his client after the release. 'At the moment, he will be in Nicaragua,' Gómez said, adding that Puracal would decide on returning to the United States in coordination with his family. Puracal, a native of Washington state, became a resident of Nicaragua after serving there as a Peace Corps volunteer in 2002. He married a Nicaraguan woman, with whom he has a son. Jesse Pedro Resau, a friend of Puracal, stands at a viewpoint in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. As a three-judge appellate panel mulls the 35-year-old American's fate, the case has drawn the scrutiny of U.S. lawmakers and human-rights advocates . Puracal made his home in the Pacific coast beach town of San Juan del Sur after a Peace Corps stint, wed a Nicaraguan woman, and they had a son, but was arrested for drug trafficking in 2010 . Friends: Kelly Thomas, owner of the coffee shop and bookstore El Gato Negro, which was frequently visited by Puracal, works in her cafe iin San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua . Before his arrest, he was working at a real estate office in the Nicaraguan city of San Juan del Sur, a surfing destination on the Pacific Coast. Puracal's supporters said he came under suspicion due to his job as a real estate agent, which gave him control over large sums of money held in escrow for property transactions. Prosecutors said Puracal used a real estate company to buy properties with drug money. The appeals court heard Puracal's case last month after his supporters pushed for a hearing, saying he was wrongly convicted. The supporters redoubled their efforts earlier this summer after learning that Puracal, who had been in solitary confinement, was put on suicide watch by Nicaraguan authorities. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said in May that Puracal was arbitrarily imprisoned and recommended he be freed. Puracal's other backers include a human rights lawyer who previously worked on behalf of former Czech President Vaclav Havel and Nobel Peace Prize laureates Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar and Desmond Tutu of South Africa. Even the California Innocence Project, which normally focuses on wrongfully convicted inmates in that state's prison system, took up his cause.","U.S. citizen jailed after he was found guilty of drug trafficking and money laundering in 2010 .

The world's oldest Ford motor car is expected to fetch more than £300,000 when it comes up for auction next month. Not only is it 109 years old, but the vehicle - known as Chassis 30 - can also be credited with having saved the fledgling firm from bankruptcy. The 'Model A' was Ford's first design, and Chassis 30 was the third of 1,750 units rolled out between 1903 and 1904. With its two predecessors consigned to the scrapheap, the vehicle takes the title of the oldest surviving Ford. Unique opportunity: The oldest surviving Ford 'Model A' was the third car ever to be built by the company . Preserved: The vintage vehicle stayed in the same family for nearly fifty years, and has been lovingly preserved by every one of its owners. It is expected to fetch upwards of £300,000 when it comes to auction in October . The US giant has since sold more than 350 million cars around the world, and is more popular in the UK than any other manufacturer. But if it wasn’t for this particular vehicle, then the company might have gone bust before it had even got off the ground. In July 1903 the newly-established Ford Motor Company was in dire straits with cash reserves of just $223.65. Deposits received on Chassis 30 and two other Model As helped see it through to the end of the month. With a 1668cc, two-cylinder engine, the four-seat Model A put out a mere 8bhp to give it a top speed of 28mph. Chassis 30 was bought new in 1903 by butter maker Herbert L McNary, and stayed within the same family until 1950. Advanced for its time: The Model A's 8bhp engine could propel it to a top speed of 28mph . Despite its age it has had just five owners in 109-years and underwent a full restoration in 2007. The antique automobile will go under the hammer at RM Auctions’ Hershey sale in Pennsylvania, USA on October 11. It is being offered with an estimate of between $300,000 and $500,000 (£186,000 - £310,000). Lifeline: The deposit on Chassis 30 saved the . fledgling Ford Motor Company from bankruptcy and ensured Detroit would . become a centre of automobile manufacturing . A statement from RM Auctions, which is handling the sale, said: 'It is impossible to overstate the importance of chassis number 30. 'It is accompanied by extensive documentation, detailing its extraordinary history, and its condition is exemplary. 'No automobile manufacturer has had anywhere close to the impact of the Ford Motor Company. Setting a precedent: Ford would go on to sell over 350 million vehicles worldwide since 1903 . 'Without Herbert L. McNary’s $170 cheque, modern day motorists might be driving Popes or Flanders or Maxwells, and might speak of Hartford or Tarrytown in the same way they speak of Detroit. 'Chassis number 30 is one of three Fords sold on the first day the Ford Motor Companyrecorded orders. 'It is the only survivor of the three, has had only five owners in the nearly 110 years since it was built, has been carefully maintained and restored, and its history and provenance are impeccable.'","109-year-old Model A was third car EVER made by Ford .

Quackers council chiefs have banned a bow tie-wearing duck from collecting cash for charity - unless it gets a permit. The bird - called Star - wears a dickie bow and waddles alongside his owner Barrie Hayman raising money for sick youngsters. Star and Barrie regularly visit businesses collecting cash from the public - already raising £6,500 for a children’s hospice. Kind hearted: Barrie Hayman and Star (pictured together) have collected thousands of pounds for charity as a popular double act on the streets of Devon . But Mr Hayman has now been told by several councils that his sidekick could be deemed 'irritating' and needs a permit. Mr Hayman, of Bideford, Devon, now has to apply 28 days in advance for a single day’s permit - meaning he would only be allowed to collect on one day each month. He said: 'If I was putting into my own pocket, I could understand it, but everything goes to the sick children. 'If a permit covered me for a year and I was able to visit a different town each day, that would be fine, but on this basis I don’t think I can carry on.' Mr Hayman and Star collect on average £200 a day by going into businesses around North and Mid Devon. Partnership: Mr Hayman (pictured left) fears he and Star (pictured left and right) could be restricted to collecting just one day a month under the terms of the permit . Star dons a bow tie and Barrie . carries a bucket and together the pair have raised £6,500 for Children’s . Hospice South West in Fremington, Devon. But council officials say to be fair to all charities, they must limit how often fundraisers are allowed to collect cash. They . also say they have to ensure charity collectors are limited in their . efforts to make sure they do not become 'irritating' to the public. But local businesses have slammed the decision and are calling for Star to be allowed to collect money as often as possible. Sally . Shephard, of Blazeys Deli in Bideford, said: 'If other charities have . complained, they must be jealous that Barrie has got off his backside to . do something to help. 'He entertains so many people. They crowd around him, and he does an amazing job. Cute: Star, an Indian runner duck, pictured when he was just days old . 'We all feel very upset because it’s such an amazing charity. Everyone’s in uproar.' Mr Hayman says the enforcement was started by North Devon District Council, who told him certain charities had complained. He is now facing the same instructions from Torridge and Mid Devon district councils. A North Devon District Council spokesman said: 'All he’s got to do is apply for a street collection permit, which is a fairly simple process. 'Our policy is to allow one charity collection per day per parish, so that the streets aren’t full of people collecting for charity, which is irritating to the public. 'We need to give all charities equal opportunities to collect.' Alana Marie Smith, director of fundraising for the hospice, said Star’s work had been ‘wonderful’. She said: 'Barrie and Star are tremendous in their fundraising efforts and in their wonderful support of the sick children.'","Barrie Hayman told that Star the duck could be deemed 'irritating' by the public .

A man whose life was traumatized from a Hamas attack aided by Iran, is taking legal action against a posh U.S. hotel that plans to house Iran's president. Stuart Hersh -- who was injured and has suffered from emotional issues after a 1997 bombing in Israel -- has filed legal papers to stop The Warwick hotel in Midtown Manhattan for accepting a reservation from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the dictator hits the Big Apple for the United Nations General Assembly that begins in late September. Hersh has a $12 million judgement against Iran, as he joined eight other bombing survivors in filing a 2000 lawsuit against the rogue nation, seeking punitive damages for their injuries in the attack. Coming to the USA: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (speaking at the UN in 2011) will return to New York in 2012 for the annual United Nations General Assembly . Welcome: The swanky NYC hotel where Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his delegation will stay is expected to cost a cool $20,000 a night for the group . Ahmadinejad and his Iranian . entourage have booked the 18th floor of the swanky hotel on 54th Street . and Sixth Avenue, for late September when he travels to the U.S. to . address the UN, according to the New York Post. The . leader, who has denied the Holocaust and said Israel . should be 'wiped off the map,' will address the body on September 26 -- . which is Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. Lawyers . for Hersh expect Iran will shell out close to $20,000 per night to . house the Iranian delegation and they claim Hersh has a right to the money, . given his successful lawsuit against the Middle Eastern nation for their role in the attack. Hersh was at the Ben Yehuda . Street pedestrian mall in downtown Jerusalem on the afternoon of . September 4, 1997, when three Hamas suicide bombers with 'cases of . powerful explosive bombs blew themselves up,' according to a federal lawsuit. Stuart Hersh is entitled to $12 million in damages for injuries after the 1997 bombing . The bombs were packed with nails, screws, pieces of glass, and chemical poisons - killing five and injuring 200. According to the lawsuit, it is estimated that Iran budgets 'between $50 million and $100 million a year sponsoring various organizations such as Hamas.' Hersh, who at the time was an American citizen, says the attack turned his life upside down. He suffered shrapnel wounds and burns and the trauma of the event led him to attempt suicide one year after the bombing. Police intervened when Hersh sat in his room alone with a loaded handgun, ready to take his own life. Additionally, Hersh has suffered from . post-traumatic stress disorder and his 'nightmares and other problems . arising from his PTSD had become overwhelming,' his social worker . Gershom Goldman said in the court filing. He also lost 60 per cent hearing loss, experiences tinnitus, back pain, chronic ear infections, bum scars, . difficulty walking, has permanent psycho motor retardation and a speech . impediment. The former journalist and police officer now lives in Hebron, in southern Israel, and says he is unable to work. Hersh, now 64, is entitled to recover compensatory damages . for his past and future pain and suffering in the amount of $12,000,000. Fancy: The posh hotel in midtown Manhattan housed Ahmadinejad for the 2011 UN General Assembly . Ahmadinejad's ability to enter the U.S. so easily has been widely protested but Hersh is seeking legal barriers to his inhibit the leader's ability to enjoy a week-long stay in the city. 'If this war criminal Ahmadinejad needs a place to sleep, maybe the murderers over in the Libyan embassy can put him up for a night,' one of Hersh's lawyers, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner of the Shurat HaDin/Israel Law Center, told the New York paper. And Hersh agrees. One of Hersh's lawyers, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, thinks the dictator should seek shelter with 'murderers over in the Libyan embassy . 'Ahmadinejad is going to be staying at The Warwick hotel, paying a . fortune, and he owes me $12 million and he just won't pay it,' Hersh . told the Post via phone from Israel, where he lives in Kiryat . Arba. 'He throws that in my face and in the face of America, saying: '""Hey, I still got money - despite your sanctions.""' Ahmadinejad's highly controversial presence at the world gathering is garnering criticism and protestors have decried The Warwick's decision to host the leader. He had also stayed at the hotel for the UN conference in 2011. 'Apparently the folks at the Warwick Hotel believe that the returns from hosting a would-be genocidal dictator are worth more than the negative publicity such an act brings,' an editorial in The Jewish Voice read. 'That any self-respecting business owners would roll out the red carpet for the mamzer is just baffling,' it added. A spokesman for the hotel did not comment to the Post on Hersh’s legal action. Additionally, Ahmadinejad's scheduled speech on the Jewish holy day is considered a slap in the face. 'Any country that sits in during . Ahmadinejad's speech is in violation of the United Nations Charter,' which forbids member states from threatening other member states, . Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ron Prosor told . the Times of Israel. Prosor also charged the Iranian regime with inventing 'new terms in the English language for liquidation, eradication and erasing of Israel and Jews from the pages of history. One cannot be quiet in the face of these anti-Semitic rants, yet we don’t hear any outcry from the international community,' he said.","Iranian delegation expected to shell out $20k per night for swanky digs at The Warwick hotel .

Alan O'Neill, 43, says he's 'embarrassed and remorseful,' the Tacoma News Tribune reports, but that it was all a mistake in paperwork that has since led to a humiliating and internationally reported scandal, and potentially the loss of his job. Charged in March after his first wife Ellenora Fulk learned of his second through a Facebook 'people you may know' notification, Ms Fulk, who was estranged from him at the time, alerted authorities. Busted: When Ellenora Fulk saw this picture on Teri Wyatt-O'Neill's Facebook page, she realised that the stranger was married to her husband, Alan O'Neill . Tipped off from that Facebook notification, the second woman's profile photo showed her and O'Neill dressed up whilesipping out of wine glasses beside a wedding cake. 'I’ve never done anything intentionally wrong in my life,' he told the Tribune. His attorney claims he used a neighbour to process his divorce's paperwork from Ms Fulk but they failed to do so. 'Mr O'Neill failed to follow through on that,' Attorney Phillip Thornton said in court. Wives: O'Neill first married Ms Fulk, left, then Ms O'Neill, right, but never divorced his first wife .

'...the defendant arrived at [Ms Fulk's] apartment, and she . asked him several times if they were divorced,' court records show. 'The defendant said, ""No, we are still married.""'

Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography . A Minnesota football coach continues to face two child pornography charges, despite investigators revealing that no evidence of child porn was found on the computers taken from the home. Minnesota State, Mankato coach Todd Hoffner was arrested and charged after three videos of his children were found on his work-issued cellphone when he took it to the university for service. His attorney and wife have publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous, saying the videos simply captured the family's children being silly. A search of computers taken from the Hoffner home has found 'no additional items that would be considered child pornography,' said Blue Earth County Sheriff's Captain Rich Murry. That information will now be forwarded to the county attorney's office. Hoffner was charged last month with . one count of using minors in a sexual performance or pornographic work . and one count of possessing child pornography. Both are felonies. His attorney, James Fleming, said he was confident that authorities would not come up with any additional evidence and the case will focus on the images recovered from the cellphone. 'So now we are dealing with: Are these images in fact, child pornography?' Fleming said. 'And I believe that it's going to be shown very clearly - they are not.' The videos include images of Hoffner's children behaving 'silly' after a bath, Fleming said. Prosecutor Mike Hanson did not return phone messages seeking comment. Search: No child porn was found on the computers taken from the Hoffner family home . Hoffner was arrested after the videos were found and escorted off a football practice field in August. He remains on leave pending a university investigation. At a hearing on Friday, Fleming pressed for greater access to the cellphone videos, saying he needed them to mount his defense. Fleming has seen the images but must go to the Blue Earth County Sheriff's Department to view them - with officials looking over his shoulder. Blue Earth District Court Judge Krista Jass took that request under advisement. According to an affidavit in the case, audio on one of the videos includes a child saying: 'Dad, that's not the show, make him do it right,' and a man's voice says, 'Do it over.' Controversy: Hoffner was arrested and escorted off a football practice field in August, he remains on leave pending a university investigation . Fleming said the suggestion that Hoffner was directing his children is 'absolutely wrong.' 'I've seen that affidavit. And I have seen the video. And that representation is wrong,' he said. The affidavit says university officials also came across a video of a roughly 40-year-old 'naked adult male jumping off a boat skinny dipping.' Fleming said Hoffner is frustrated, and the publicity has made the case difficult. Support: Hoffman's wife Melodee has publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous saying that her husband is innocent and charges against him are 'ridiculous and baseless' 'He's very protective of his family,' he said. Hoffner is entering his fifth year as head football coach at Minnesota State, Mankato. He led the team to the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and a share of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference title in 2011. He has a 34-13 record at Minnesota State, Mankato, and was named NSIC coach of the year in 2009.","Todd Hoffner, 46, was escorted off the pitch last month during training .

The smell of a zesty ripe lemon, freshly brewed coffee, or flowers in a summer garden is a pleasure many of us take for granted daily. But one woman is rediscovering the delights of all of her favourite aromas after NHS surgery at a pioneering clinic restored her sense of smell after almost four decades. Keen cook June Blythe, 65, of Taverham, Norfolk, realised the operation was a success when she was suddenly able to smell lemon she was zesting to make lemon and sultana scones. Ecstatic: June Blythe has recovered her sense of smell after 37 years following new pioneering surgery . Mrs . Blythe lost her sense of smell and taste when she . developed the condition chronic rhinosinusitis in 1975 just before the . birth of her second daughter. But amazingly the grandmother still won prizes for cooking, despite being unable to smell or taste anything she made. She said she actually got her pleasure from her food giving satisfaction to others. Mrs Blythe also refused to let her condition stop her from training and working as an aromatherapist, treating her clients with plant oils. The problem, which left her unable to breathe through her nose and aggravated her asthma, failed to be cured by three operations to remove growths from her nasal passages. But after an extensive operation to clear polyps -abnormal growths of tissue - from her sinus cavities at the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk, her sense of smell returned. Mrs Blythe underwent surgery as a patient at Britain's only NHS Smell and Taste Clinic at the James Paget University Hospital. The . pioneering clinic is helping diagnose and treat people from across the . country that suffer from a condition called anosmia - the inability to . detect odours. Small instruments were used inside the nose to take out each polyp, and surgeons then washed out Mrs Blythe' sinuses. Mrs Blythe is now rediscovering a world of smells and scents, and the powerful effect it has had on her emotions and sense of taste. Blossoming: Mrs Blythe's sense of smell is finally allowing her to enjoy her favourite scents again, including her flower garden . She said: 'I just keep having these amazing experiences. I can honestly tell you it's like I'm living in a different world. 'I never thought that this would be an experience I would ever have after 37 years of no sense of smell at all. I'm just taking full advantage now to be able to smell everything and taste everything.' Mrs Blythe underwent her latest three hour operation on June 26 and did not held out any hope that it would be a success. But her sense of smell suddenly returned at home ten days later, when the inflammation had gone down. She said: 'I was cooking with lemon, making lemon and sultana scones for friends coming round and all of a sudden I could smell lemon. 'I was on my own and just stood there and cried.' 1)  'Lemon has to be the best one as that . was the first thing I smelt and it was a tremendous feeling. Grating . that lemon and realising that I could smell it - I was beside myself.'2) 'Coffee has to be second because it's just lovely.'3)' The spices that I use with my cooking. I love cumin, chilli, . coriander, but all of them really. I love getting out my mortar and . pestle and grinding seeds now.'4) ' I'm a member of Plant Heritage and I absolutely adore flowers, so it . would be that. I wish it was rose season, but I just missed it this . year.'5) 'My husband's . garage at Easton, Golden Days Motor Services. It's an Aladdin's Cave of . parts of classic cars and our customers have often mentioned that they . wish we could bottle how it smells, as it's a very distinctive, . old-fashioned smell of oil and engines that you don't get at new . garages. It reminds me of when we were first married and how John used . to smell when he came home from work.' Mrs Blythe rang her husband John who runs a classic car business to tell him the news. He then asked if she had smelt anything else yet and told her to try smelling coffee. She was too afraid to try it at first, but when she opened a packet of Italian ground coffee and realised she could smell it, she admitted she was 'overwhelmed'. A few days more she finally had the courage to put on the perfume she had never smelt - the Estee Lauder brand Intuition that she worn for years after it had been chosen for her by her two daughters. She said: 'I knew instantly what my daughters and husband meant when they said it smells of Mum, and I loved it.' Regaining her sense of smell has also awakened strong emotions from the time before she developed chronic rhinosinusitis. Mrs Blythe who has two grandchildren said: 'My first baby boy didn't survive. He was full-term but he died and we had to come home from hospital without a baby. 'You can imagine there are those smells that distinctly associated with a baby and I went straight into the nursery we had prepared and I could smell everything. 'The smell of the wool, the newness of the clothes, particularly the Johnson's baby powder and the soap. 'You smell it and you never forget it. 'I would torture myself and keep going in to the room, opening the wardrobe and holding the little vests and smelling them and the smells of a new baby.'Mrs Blythe was able to enjoy the same aromas when she and her husband had their first daughter Susie. Favourite smells: Coffee and lemons are among the aromas Mrs Blythe missed most . But she had completely lost her sense of smell by the time her second daughter Claire arrived so she is now eagerly awaiting the arrival of her third grandchild, due early next year.","Operation removes small nasal lumps which block sense of smell .

Iran has admitted it has elite guards in Syria helping Bashar al-Assad's forces subdue rebel fighters. The top commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard said the elite unit has high-level advisers in Syria, and warned it would get involved if al-Assad's forces came under attack. Comments made yesterday by Mohammad Ali Jafari were the clearest indication yet that Iran is directly assisting its Arab ally in fighting rebels. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the head of Oran's Revolutionary Guard, denied the country had a 'military presence' in Syria (file picture) But Ali Jafari yesterday denied that the presence of elite troops in Syria counted as military help. He said: 'A number of members of the Qods force are present in Syria but this does not constitute a military presence.' Ali Jafari claimed his men were only providing Syria with 'intellectual and advisory help'. Sunday's comments by Jafari were the first official remarks of their kind, and mark the clearest indication of Iran's direct assistance to its main Arab allies: Assad and Lebanon's Hezbollah. It also suggests Tehran is wary about being drawn into a Middle East conflict if outside forces attack Assad, who is locked in a civil war with rebel forces. The revelations about Iran's involvement came as more government airstrikes in Syria destroyed buildings . Iran has backed Syria's President Bashar al-Assad since the crisis began almost 18 months ago . Jafari told reporters that Quds force members have been in Syria and Lebanon as advisers for a long time, but was not more specific. He says decisions about whether to boost military aid to Syria if attacked would 'depend on the circumstances.' In early August, members of the Free Syrian Army abducted 48 Iranians, whom they claimed were members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. After first denying their military roles, Iran later said the hostages were 'retired' military members on a pilgrimage. A Free Syrian Army commander later told al-Jazeera that his brigade had 'intelligence information' and 'documents' showing that the group belonged to the Revolutionary Guards and had come to Syria to 'serve the regime'. Iran has backed Syria's President Bashar al-Assad since the crisis began almost 18 months ago, and regards his rule as a key part of its axis of resistance against Israel and Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.","Revolutionary Guard boss admits Iran would intervene if Syria was attacked .

The beautifully illustrated first edition of JM Barrie's Peter Pan In Kensington Gardens, was discovered by staff as they rifled through a bin bag full of books and bric-a-brac donated to an Oxfam store in Alderly Edge in Cheshire. Published in 1906, the novel, which is set prior to the author's most famous work originally called Peter Pan and Wendy, features around 50 detailed illustrations. Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens was discovered in a bin bag full of bogs which had been donated to a branch of Oxfam . Illustration of The Kensington Gardens are in London: The novel is one of only 500 copies signed by artist Arthur Rackham . himself . The gold-titled A3-sized volume is signed and illustrated by renowed artist Arthur Rackham who was widely regarded as one of the leading illustrators from the so-called Golden Age of British book illustration between 1900 to 1914. It was donated to the charity shop by a mystery benefactor who left the haul in the black bag and asked that they be put on the shelves - but failed to mention the valuable book. The novel - one of only 500 copies signed by Rackham himself - will now go under the hammer after experts valued it at around £800. Katie Robb, manager of the Oxfam store, said today: 'A chap came in saying that he had some books that he wanted to donate, but didn’t let on that there was anything special about any of them. 'He brought in a few bin bags of books and the volunteer on at the time took them off him and put them in the back room ready to be sorted through.

'I was going to leave it until the next day as it was near closing time, but I’m glad I didn’t now. As soon as I opened the first bag and took out a couple of books I knew straight away that this was something special. 'I have seen a lot of books since working for Oxfam so I am familiar with when they are something different. 'It’s such an impressive looking book. When I looked in the book the plates are beautiful. It’s around A3 in size, traditional looking but what sets it apart from normal books is that it has very thick, cream-coloured pages in the first half, where the story is told, and then the back half is done on brown paper. 'It’s bound in Velom, which is not available any more, and it’s got gold illustration and also the other big thing is that it is first edition limited to 500 copies.

Illustration of Away he flew, right over the house- its first edition was limited to 500 copies . Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens features the youngster's adventures in the famous London park . Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens was written in 1906 although it was based in part on author JM Barrie's first book featuring the boy who never grow entitled Little White Bird, published in 1902. The book was written two years after Barrie's most famous work originally called Peter and Wendy in which the young hero battles with the evil Captain Hook on the faraway island of Neverland - neither of which appear in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. In the less well known Peter Pan book Peter is younger than in Peter Pan and Wendy and at the start of the novel Barrie states that is a seven-day-old infant who used to be part bird and has the the ability to fly. He escapes out of the window of his London nursery and lands beside the Long Water lake and heads for Kensington Gardens in the centre of London. However, upon returning to the famous park, Peter is informed by the crow Solomon Caw that he has lost much of his bird-like abilities including the power to fly. Stranded in Kensington Gardens Peter can only get around on foot, but he commissions the building of a child-sized thrush's nest which he uses as a boat to navigate the Gardens by way of the Serpentine, the large lake that divides Kensington Gardens from Hyde Park. Although they are initially frightened by him Peter gains the trust of the fairies. He amuses them with his human ways, and agrees to play the panpipes at the fairy dances. Eventually, Queen Mab grants him two wishes. The first he uses to return home to his mother. The fairies reluctantly help him to fly home and he finds his beloved mother asleep in his bedroom.Peter decides to return to Kensington Gardens one final time to say goodbye to his friends, but after discovering that his mother has given birth to another boy he is left heartbroken, fearing she will no longer want him and he remains in Kensington Gardens . Peter later meets a little girl named Maimie Mannering, who is lost in the Gardens. The pair become friends and eventually marrry. Maimie wants to stay with Peter but realising her mother must be missing her, she leaves Peter to return home. Maimie does not forget Peter, however, and when she is older, she makes presents and letters for him. Maimie is the literary predecessor to the character Wendy Darling in Barrie's later Peter and Wendy story.Throughout the novel, Peter misunderstands simple things like children's games. He does not know what a pram is, mistaking it for an animal, and he becomes extremely attached to a boy's lost kite. It is only when Maimie tells him that he discovers he plays all his games incorrectly. When Peter is not playing, he likes to make graves for the children who get lost at night, burying them with little headstones in the Gardens. A bronze statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, next to Hyde Park to acknowledge the novel was built in 1912. The exact location was chosen by Peter Pan's author, J.M. Barrie who lived close to Kensington Gardens. Barrie began planning the Peter Pan statue in 1906. He took photos of the six-year-old Michael Llewelyn Davies wearing a special Peter Pan costume to help a sculptor recreate his vision. In 1912, he found the man to make the statue, Sir George Frampton, and by 1st May that year, the sculpture was in place in Kensington Gardens. The timing of the discovery is also remarkable as it coincides with Ms Robb organisation of a local book festival which will take place this weekend (September 15 and 16) to raise funds for Oxfam. TV antiques expert Adam Partridge said: 'The discovery of this rare copy of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens is a great development and it should be the highlight of the auction.' Rackham illustrated many books at the turn of the 20th Century at a time when there was a demand for high quality, illustrated books that typically were given as Christmas gifts. His images have been widely used by the greeting card industry and many of his books are still in print or have been recently available in both paperback and hardback editions. Illustration of A Hundred flew off with the string . Illustration of When they think you are not looking . Illustration of When you meet grown up people in the gardens . His original drawings and paintings including those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella are keenly sought at the major international art auction houses. He died in 1939 from cancer aged 71. The book is one of four major literary works by Barrie featuring Peter Pan. The little boy first appeared in a section of The Little White Bird, a 1902 novel written by Barrie for adults. The character’s best-known adventure debuted on 27 December 1904, in the stage play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up. Following the highly successful debut of the 1904 play, Barrie’s publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, extracted chapters of The Little White Bird and republished them in 1906 under the title Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, with the addition of illustrations by Rackham.

He might have reached the ripe old age of 133 - in canine terms - but this pooch proves it's never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks. Blackie is well into his retirement - and should be taking things easy - but the energetic mongrel is often seen bounding around the kennels in south London which he currently calls home. Staff there say Blackie is not yet too long in the tooth to be re-homed - and they are hopeful they can find him a new owner who will care for him in his twilight years. Mongrel of maturity: Staff at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home believe Blackie could be the oldest pooch to walk through their gates since it was founded in 1860 . At 19 canine years - the human . equivalent of reaching 133 years - Blackie is by far the oldest resident . of Battersea Dog and Cats' Home in south London. He is among a growing number of pets at the kennels who are living longer in their retirement years. In fact, staff at Battersea believe Blackie could be the oldest dog to ever walk through its gates since it was founded in 1860. The charity now hopes it can find an owner willing to give him a comfortable home for the remainder of his life. Blackie . arrived in August as his owners could no longer care for him. However, . he has impressed staff with his energy and his love of playing with . toys, going for walks and lapping up attention. Philip Heron, operations manager at . Battersea, said: 'Blackie's owners assured us he is 19, and we can't . find any record of an older dog ever arriving at Battersea. Golden oldie: At the age of 19 - about 133 years in human terms - Blackie is among an increasing number of pets at the home who are living longer in their retirement years . 'A 15, 16 or 17 year old dog isn't such a rare sight in our kennels, but a 19 year old is a real record-breaker for Battersea. Blackie still has lots of love to give, so we're searching for a special home for him.' The number of older pets at Battersea has increased by two thirds in the last five years. In 2007 the charity looked after 264 dogs and cats aged 10 years or older, and based on current figures it expects to care for more than 430 this year. The average age for a dog or cat depends on its breed, but this year Battersea has already cared for seven dogs and 18 cats aged 15 or older. Mr Heron added: 'We believe dogs and cats are living longer than they might have done a decade ago. This is fantastic news for owners who can't imagine saying goodbye to their faithful friend, but we want to remind people they could be paying for vet and food bills until well into their pet's old age.' He added: 'People are feeding their pets better diets which definitely helps. Going back 10 years, dogs used to arrive who ate their owner's leftover cereal for breakfast, whereas now they can enjoy tailored hypo-allergenic diets. 'Many owners are also finding it easier to get veterinary treatment, either thanks to subsidised vets or through pet insurance.'",Mongrel Blackie is the oldest dog ever at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home .

Credit-research firm Egan-Jones has downgraded its rating on U.S. government debt from AA to AA- as the Federal Reserve announced its plans to try to stimulate the economy. The Fed announced it would buy $40 billion of mortgage bonds a month to help the recovery, but it will likely hurt the economy more than help it, Egan-Jones said. The plan will weaken the value of the dollar and push up prices for oil and other commodities leaving less for customers to spend on others things, the credit rating agency said. Kick-start: The U.S. Federal Reserve plans to pump $40bn into the U.S. economy through quantitative easing . At the same time, Egan-Jones, which lowered its rating on the U.S. from AA+ in April, warned that the federal government's borrowing costs are likely to slowly rise as the global economy recovers. It comes as European stock markets rose after the U.S. Federal Reserve attempted to initiate economic recovery through its quantitative easing. The Fed's decision to inject $40bn (£25bn) a month in the U.S. economy saw UK, French and German stocks rise 2% in afternoon trading. And as European markets rose, financially-troubled Greece and Spain were given a stay of execution after being given more time to reach financial targets. The launch of a third round of . quantitative easing – dubbed QE3 – prompted the FTSE 100 to jump 95.63 points to 5915.55 on a bumper day for investors and pensioners - adding £24 billion to the value of Britain’s leading companies. Fears for the world economy remain, . as Eurogroup finance ministers met in Cyprus to discuss measures to end . the current eurozone debt crisis. Greece . may get more time to reach targets under its 130 billion euro rescue . package but is unlikely to receive more money, with a decision needed by . the end of October. Struggle: Egan-Jones announced that it is downgrading its rating on U.S. debt to AA- from AA, citing the Federal Reserve's plans to stimulate the economy . Spain, . under pressure to spell out whether it needs more financial support, . told euro zone finance ministers on Friday it will present a new set of . structural economic reforms with firm deadlines by the end of the month. Greek . Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, leading a country in its fifth year of . recession at a time of rising discontent at home, wants two more years . to implement economic reforms tied to the bailout to soften their . impact. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said lenders may now agree to some sort of extension. Delaying tactics: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras wants two more years to implement economic reforms . She said: 'There are various ways to adjust: time is one and that needs to be considered as an option.' Greece's second bailout envisages Athens returning to international markets by 2015, but with two consecutive parliamentary elections in May and June after political parties struggled to form a coalition, the country has lost ground on its reform agenda. Deepening recession has also made the debt targets less attainable. In Spain, Madrid's borrowing costs . have fallen sharply since the European Central Bank said it was ready to . buy its bonds, but the scale of debt repayments it faces before the . year-end and a deepening recession mean most analysts and policymakers . believe it only a matter of time before it requires help. But at the Cyprus meeting, there was no talk of a third bailout. Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said: 'There will probably be no more money (for Greece).' It was not immediately clear how . ministers will reconcile the issue, but, having made strenuous efforts . to shore up Spain and Italy, it would make no sense to tip Greece into . default now and plunge the currency bloc back into chaos. Spanish Finance Minister Luis de Guindos, pictured with George Osborne in May, said today he would implement a new set of reforms in Spain to boost growth . Athens, . where Europe's debt crisis began nearly three years ago, has been . boosted by a decision to give bailed-out Portugal more time to meet its . fiscal targets as economic recession saps Lisbon's ability to deliver. Economy . Minister Luis de Guindos told journalists after meeting his peers in . Cyprus: 'We will adopt a new set of reforms to boost growth... It will . be in line with the recommendations of the European Commission.' Although the extent of the shortfall will not be known until a report by lenders in October, Greece is unlikely to win back investor confidence quickly and meet its targets, which include a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of economic output in 2014. EU officials said Athens is way behind on its debt-cutting programme, suggesting Greece will need funding support past 2014 until it can return to market. Spain's 2013 budget and a detailed audit of the capital needs of its banking sector are both due on Sept. 28. For . the first time in months, ministers met at a moment when market . pressure for immediate action to solve the sovereign debt crisis is . easing, rather than mounting. The ECB's announcement that it could . buy unlimited amounts of Spanish bonds, should it agree a programme with . the euro zone bailout fund, brought Spanish 10-year bond yields down . from 7.64 percent on July 24 to 5.62 percent on Thursday. IMF director Christine Lagarde said lenders may now agree to some sort of time extension for financially-troubled Greece . Italian yields have fallen to around 5 percent and the euro rose above $1.30 after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a new programme of asset purchases to support the economy. That increases the temptation for Spain, and EU paymaster Germany, to try to get by without an assistance programme that would be politically unpopular in both Madrid and Berlin. Each time market stress has eased in the nearly three-year crisis, German leaders have said they see no urgent need to act. 'There is no more room for complacency than there was six months ago, but we are moving in the right direction,' European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commssioner Olli Rehn cautioned. Spain is reluctant to ask for help because Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy fears a political backlash at home, but he may eventually have no choice given Madrid's borrowing needs. A German official said privately that Berlin did not want to see Spain pushed into an unnecessary rescue application at a time when its funding conditions were improving, adding a Spanish bailout was not inevitable.","Egan-Jones cut rating on U.S. debt from AA to AA- .

Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, has been a longstanding critic of the war in Afghanistan . A Labour MP was today kicked out of the House of Commons after accusing defence ministers of lying over military policy in Afghanistan. Paul Flynn, MP for Newport West, was suspended by Speaker John Bercow after likening the government’s approach to the First World War when ‘politicians lied and soldiers died’. He said the public wanted British troops brought home. It came as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond was forced to appear at the despatch box to respond to reports that Nato was scaling back operations with Afghan forces after a spate of attacks by rogue soldiers and policemen. Mr Hammond said Mr Flynn's claims about the government’s approach ‘were scandalous’. But Mr Flynn refused to withdraw them, and was told to leave. Giving an emergency statement, Mr Hammond was responding to news that Nato troops and their Afghan counterparts would axe joint, routine patrols and only launch big strike missions. The minister claimed Britain's strategy was unchanged. But he said the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) had taken ‘prudent but temporary measures’ following outrage among Muslims at a YouTube video mocking the prophet Mohammed. Then Mr Flynn spoke out, directly accusing ministers of culpability in the rising death toll of British troops. Scroll down for video . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond visited Afghanistan last week but has since been forced to explain changes in policy . He said: ‘The role of our brave soldiers at the moment is to act as human shields for ministers' reputation. ‘The danger to our soldiers is being prolonged by those on that (front) bench who have the power to stop it. ‘Other countries have removed their soldiers from this dangerous area where they are not doing what we are doing which is arming and training our future enemy. ‘Isn't this very similar to the end of the First World War, when it was said that politicians lied and soldiers died and the reality was, as it is now, that our brave soldier lions are being led by ministerial donkeys.’ Mr Bercow interrupted and questioned whether he had intended to accuse ministers of lkying, something which is banned in Parliament. ‘That's precisely what I am saying’ Mr Flynn replied. ‘I believe we have had lies from the minister and I believe that our soldiers are being let down.' For a second time Mr Bercow intervened, and told Mr Flynn to withdraw the remark, but he refused. Commons Speaker John Bercow twice intervened to order Paul Flynn to withdraw his claim the ministers had lied - but he refused . Mr Flynn insisted: ‘I have to insist on retaining my accusation of lying. That is far more important than a lying group of people who send our soldiers to die in vain in a war which we should withdraw and from which the country wants us to withdraw. ‘I accept the consequences of what I am saying.’ At which point Mr Bercow used a Commons procedure to ‘name’ Mr Flynn, and a motion was moved to suspend him from the Commons for the rest of the day. Mr Bercow said: ‘I'm sorry to say you are ignoring the ruling of the chair and in so doing you are behaving, whatever your motives, in a grossly disorderly manner and in those circumstances I am obliged to name Paul Flynn, the MP for Newport West.’ Mr Hammond said: 'My response was going to be simply to note that Mr Flynn's accusation was scandalous.' The Defence Secretary has faced repeated calls for British troops to be brought home by Christmas. In the Commons today, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said: 'Are you really going to allow more troops to die for a war that's not been won, that cannot be won and will become increasingly unpopular with the public in this country?' Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former commander of UN forces in Bosnia, added: 'It worries me a great deal we are continuing to allow our soldiers to go right to the front line and they are therefore seemingly in greater danger than their American colleagues.'","Paul Flynn kicked out after likening conflict to the First World War when 'politicians lied and soldiers died'

Police have dropped an investigation into a stolen mobile phone even though the female victim tracked down the thief, giving police a dossier of evidence including the suspect’s photo. Sylvia Parnell, 68, was ‘furious’ when police told her they were dropping the case despite the fact that she had traced the suspect to various addresses using a tracking device on her phone. Her phone, a Samsung Galaxy worth £500, was stolen from a west London cafe but Ms Parnell was able to trace it to addresses in Harrow, north-west London and various addresses in central London using a tracking ‘find my phone’ app which was installed on the mobile. 'On a plate': Sylvia Parnell gave evidence to police, including a photo of the suspect and various addresses, to catch the thief who stole her phone from a cafe (in the background) but police have dropped the case . Police responded to one call after the phone was traced to a central London pub but were unable to make an arrest because there were too many people in the building. Monitored by her son Thomas, an IT developer, he noticed that the suspect had returned to the same cafe where the phone was taken and Ms Parnell went there with a friend and noticed a man sitting alone who she says was acting suspiciously. She took a picture of her friend with the man in the background and as the suspect left, Ms Parnell followed him to his car and recorded his registration details. She then gave this information to police. Ms Parnell said she contacted police numerous times after first reporting the crime in June before they closed the case last week, telling her they did not have the resources to follow it up. Suspect photographed: After tracing her mobile back to the cafe where her phone was stolen using a tracking app on her phone, Ms Parnell took this photo of her friend, with the man she believes stole her phone sitting behind him (to the right) She said: ‘I had given him to them on a plate and in the same cafe - all they had to do was check it out. ‘They just told me it wasn’t a priority and then said they wouldn’t be pursuing it any further. 'Gave them everything': Ms Parnell says she contacted police on several occasions but was left 'staggered by their attitude and frustrated that they wouldn't take any action' ‘I . told police all of this, gave them addresses, the photo and car . registration. All in all I must have spoken to them seven or eight times . and wrote several letters. I was staggered by their attitude and . frustrated that they wouldn’t take any action. ‘I . am so angry. I feel like I have been fobbed off. How much help do the . police want? I gave them everything. 'All they had to do was make some . routine inquiries but they’ve just dropped it. ‘The police say they want help from the public to stop crime but my experience was the exact opposite.’ A police spokeswoman said: ‘The victim initially reported her phone as a theft on 5 July after she had left it in a cafe. ‘She did not recheck the tracker until over a month later on 15 August. It was reclassified as a theft-related crime on August 16 and the investigation was given to an officer to review the crime. ‘There was no evidence this “suspect” did have her phone, delay between original report of loss and tracking info given to police, more than a month, meant he could easily have obtained it innocently. Most robbers pass on within 24 hours.’ The case comes after a BBC reporter tracked down a robber who mugged him at knife point using a tracker app last week. Following the incident, police said they had ‘had some real successes using tracker technology to trace stolen phones and computers’, urging members of the public to ‘help us to help you’. Ms Parnell added: ‘I know it’s only a phone but if they can’t get the little things right how are they going to get the public to help on bigger crimes. ‘For all I know this person could be a serial thief. All it would take is one junior officer to look into it, run the number plate through the system, that sort of thing. ‘My son wanted to go round to the address but I’m scared he will put himself in danger. We really shouldn’t have to do that.’","Sylvia Parnell traced the suspect who she believes stole her phone from a west London cafe .

British officials have rejected US requests to use UK military bases for the growth of forces in the Gulf - as fears continue to grow over Iran’s nuclear capabilities, it was reported last night. The Americans are also said to have asked to use British bases in Cyprus - and fly from US bases on the British territories of Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. But British ministers have referenced legal advice from the Attorney General, insisting Iran - which is still denying any plans for nuclear weapon development - does not pose ‘a clear and present threat’. Request: The Americans have reportedly asked to use British bases in Cyprus - and fly from US bases on the British territories of Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean and Diego Garcia (pictured) in the Indian Ocean . The key guidance - sent to the Ministry of Defence, Number 10 and the Foreign Office - added that helping forces who could be involved in a pre-emptive strike would be breaking international law. ‘The UK would be in breach of international law if it facilitated what amounted to a pre-emptive strike on Iran,’ a senior Whitehall source told the Guardian. The US is not said to think a rise in the chances of conflict will happen soon - and it is believed the discussions with Britain have only been to find out their stance. But one source said the US was ‘surprised’ Britain is ‘reluctant to provide assurances’ on assistance. ‘They'd expect resistance from senior Liberal Democrats, but it's Tories as well,’ the source stated.

British military officials flew to Tampa, Florida, this summer to discuss contingency plans with the US, but had believed the UK would only be involved once conflict had begun, reported the Guardian. The Foreign Office told the Daily Mail that the Government continues to insists that a military strike against Iran is not the right course of action at the moment, ‘although no option is off the table’. A spokesman added: ‘We believe that the twin-track approach of pressure through sanctions, which are having an impact, and engagement with Iran is the best way to resolve the nuclear issue. Strike? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shows a threat level illustration as he describes his concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month . ‘We are not going to speculate about scenarios in which military action would be legal. 'We believe that the twin-track approach of pressure through sanctions, which are having an impact, and engagement with Iran is the best way to resolve the nuclear issue' Foreign Office spokesman . 'That would depend on the circumstances at the time.’ The Foreign Office would not reveal whether the Attorney General’s advice was requested. A US state department official told the Guardian that the US and UK ‘co-ordinate on all kinds of subjects all the time’ and it would ‘never speak on the record' about these conversations. Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested to the United Nations last month that his country may take military action against Iran by next spring to set back its nuclear programme.","US officials have 'also asked UK diplomats for use of British bases in Cyprus'

Changes: Cambridge's department of pure mathematics is said to have submitted a report to the Department for Education outlining how new-style maths A-levels should be structured . Cambridge wants changes to be made because most talented students who it recruits don’t have sufficient basic maths skills to help them ‘confidently engage anything other than routine problems’. ‘Existing A-level curriculums treat topics superficially and the UK has lost the tradition of teaching school mathematics coherently and in depth,’ the report said. ‘The effect on Cambridge is acute.’ The document by department head Professor Martin Hyland suggests that A-levels should be focused around a series of ‘key mathematical ideas’, reported the Daily Telegraph. This is expected to include combinatorics, trigonometry, complex numbers, centres of mass and probability. In addition it recommends ‘graded sets of problems’ should be set for bright teenagers.

Winston Churchill wanted Nazi leaders to be executed and others imprisoned without trial - instead of going through the Nuremberg war crimes tribunals, according to wartime diaries declassified today. But Britain's wartime prime minister was said to have been swayed against the idea at the famous 'Big Three' conference in 1945 by US president Franklin D Roosevelt and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Roosevelt argued the US public would want proper trials and Stalin thought they would provide good propaganda. The British agreed to the hearings, despite fears they could set a dangerous example. Talks: Winston Churchill (left) was said to have been swayed against the idea for summary executions at the Yalta 'Big Three' conference in 1945 by US president Franklin D Roosevelt (centre) and Joseph Stalin (right) The 1940s and 1950s diary was by ex-MI5 head of counter-espionage Guy Liddell, who backed a plan from Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Sir Theobald Mathew to ‘bump off’ certain Nazis. He dictated an entry in June 1945 about talks with a member of the British War Crimes Executive, an MI6 official and a Special Operations Executive representative over a war crimes prosecution. Mr Liddell said the DPP wanted a committee to ‘come to the conclusion that certain people should be bumped off and that others should receive varying terms of imprisonment’, reported the Guardian. This would have been put to the Commons - and ‘any military body finding these individuals in their area’ would have had authority to ‘arrest them and inflict whatever punishment had been decided on’. Key hearings: The Nuremberg trials were a defining moment in international justice that saw the 21 defendants accused of acts such as crimes against peace and humanity, and abuse and murder of prisoners . Trial: The accused included Hermann Goring (pictured in the dock), Commander of the Luftwaffe; Admiral Karl Donitz, who became president of German after Adolf Hitler's death; and Hitler's close friend Albert Speer . ‘This was a much clearer proposition and would not bring the law into disrepute,’ Mr Liddell said. According to The Times, he added in . the diary which was codenamed Wallflowers: ‘Winston had put this forward . at Yalta but Roosevelt felt that the Americans would want a trial. 'Joe supported Roosevelt on the perfectly frank ground that the Russians liked public trials for propaganda purposes. Source: The 1940s and 1950s diary was by ex-MI5 head of counter-espionage Guy Liddell . 'It seems to me that we are just being dragged down to the level of the travesties of justice that have been taking place in the USSR for the past 20 years.’ A year later Mr Liddell flew to Nuremberg with MI5 deputy head Oswald Harker to witness 21 senior Nazis prosecuted - and felt his concerns about a show trial had been confirmed, reported the Guardian. ‘One cannot escape the feeling that most of the things the 21 are accused of having done over a period of 14 years, the Russians have done over a period of 28 years,’ he wrote in the diary. Mr Liddell said this contributed to the ‘somewhat phoney atmosphere of the whole proceedings’. He added that the experience led to one of the biggest worries for him, that the court was 'one of the victors who have framed their own charter, their own procedure and their own rules of evidence in order to deal with the vanquished'. The Nuremberg trials were a defining moment in war crimes justice that saw the 21 defendants accused of acts such as crimes against peace and humanity, and murder of prisoners. It was described by the British president of the tribunal, Justice Geoffrey Lawrence, as ‘unique in the history of the jurisprudence of the world and of supreme importance to millions of people’.

Her iconic green curtain dress and burgundy ball gown from the 1939 film Gone with the Wind have been saved from deterioration by a £18,600 ($30,000) conservation effort in the US. The dresses worn by actress Vivien Leigh are now on display for the first time in nearly 30 years at the Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington, London, as part of a Hollywood costume exhibit. Famous outfit: The restored burgundy ball gown (right), worn by Vivien Leigh (left) as Scarlett O'Hara in 1939 film Gone With The Wind, is now on show at the Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington, London . Officials at the Harry Ransom Center research library at the University of Texas in Austin announced the project two years ago, noting the dresses were in danger of falling apart from age. The dresses were made of heavy fabric and were not built to last. Weakened stitching and sagging waistlines had to be repaired. Conservators also had to remove some previous alternation work and additions, such as feathers placed on the burgundy gown. ‘All of those areas would have got worse,' said Jill Morena, the Ransom Center's assistant curator for costumes and personal effects. 'All the vulnerable parts have been stabilised.' Difficult work: Conservator Cara Varnell (left) uses an optivisor to study the green curtain dress (restored; right) ‘It has been a success. We would not be able to display them without this effort.' 'All the vulnerable parts have been stabilised. It has been a success.

She . stressed the project was not intended to restore the dresses to looking . brand new, but to save them so they could again be viewed by the . public. For example, the green dress has long faded streaks and conservators did not try to restore its original colour. The Ransom Center acquired the dresses with the collection of film producer David O. Selznick in the 1980s. Conservators wanted them ready in time for a 2014 Ransom Center exhibit to mark the film's 75th anniversary. Tricky craft: In this photo from the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas, conservator Cara Varnell works on the burgundy ball gown.

'The wedding veil, once you touched the tulle you realised how brittle and fragile it is' Jill Morena, Harry Ransom Center . The green curtain dress and the burgundy ball gown were completed in time to join the London exhibit which began last Saturday and runs through to January 27. Other pieces, including a blue velvet night gown and Scarlett's wedding dress and veil, were too fragile to handle and will go back into storage. The Ransom Center plans no additional work on those pieces. ‘The wedding veil, once you touched the tulle you realised how brittle and fragile it is,’ Ms Morena said.","University of Texas' conservation effort to restore dresses cost £18,600 .

Francesca Goodby calmly talked her mother Kay, 28, through the sudden birth after her waters broke in Bearwood, West Midlands - while her father Michael, 33, was calling 999. She helped her panicking mother with her breathing, encouraging her to push, fetched her clean towels and even made sure the umbilical cord was not wrapped around the baby’s head. Francesca leapt into action in July after recalling an episode of Casualty when a woman suddenly went into labour. After 12 minutes of pushing, 6lbs 8oz baby Roisin had been delivered. The schoolgirl said: ‘I had to keep mummy calm. I didn’t want the cord to be wrapped around her neck because she might have died and I held her when she was born to keep her safe. ‘I don’t know how I knew about it but I do watch Casualty and like it a lot. My friends at school all said “wow” and my teacher was really impressed with me.' When two ambulances arrived, paramedics were stunned to find Francesca - who wants to be a doctor when she is older - holding her newborn sister after carefully wrapping her in a towel. Shop assistant Mrs Goodby said yesterday: ‘I was so impressed with Francesca. She was remarkably cool and collected for a six-year-old. 'She had gone to bed but woke up when I started screaming. ‘She came in and was like “mummy are you okay?” and said “I can see the head”. She was keeping me calm and telling me where to put my hands and telling me to keep breathing. Sisters: The schoolgirl helped her panicking mother with her breathing, encouraging her to push, fetched her clean towels and even made sure the umbilical cord was not wrapped round the baby's head . ‘As soon as she was born she got a towel and it was like she knew what to do - I didn’t say anything to her. Francesca had her wrapped up and made sure the cord wasn’t wrapped around her neck. ‘My husband was downstairs on the phone for 12 minutes and a few minutes after she was born two ambulances turned up. They were shocked that Francesca was holding her in towels.’ She added that her daughter must have learned how to deliver a baby by watching Casualty - and when they saw a recent episode where a lady gave birth, Francesca said: ‘That’s your story, mummy.’ Mrs Goodby started having contractions every 20 minutes on July 16. The next day she went to her chosen birthing centre but was discharged because she was only in the early stages of labour. Once at home, she said she called her midwife 10 times to say her contractions were stronger and lasting longer - but was told her labour wasn’t advanced because she could speak normally. Team effort: Mrs Goodby is seen left with her two daughters, and right with her newborn baby Roisin in hospital .

Finally, just before 10pm on July 17, her waters broke after she went to the toilet. Her screaming woke up Francesca - who came to her mother’s aide as her father went downstairs to call 999. The delivery was quick after her waters broke and following an overnight stay in hospital, mother and baby were discharged. She is now looking forward to one day telling Roisin how her older sister helped bring her into the world. Mr Goodby, also a shop assistant, missed Francesca’s birth too thanks to work obligations. Mrs Goodby said: ‘I had just gave birth to Francesca and he turned up, he just missed it.

The latest peace bid in Syria appeared to have failed last night as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad renewed their attack on major cities, killing at least eight people and injuring hundreds more. The violence came on the second day of a truce called by Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN and Arab League peace envoy, to mark the Muslim Eid  al-Adha holiday. Opposition activists in the capital Damascus, second city Aleppo and the eastern city of Deir al-Zor, said the Syrian army started firing into residential areas at 7am. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says eight people were killed in an airstrike in the Damascus suburb of Arbeen. Heavy machine gun fire could also be heard along the Turkey-Syria border. Some 32,000 Syrians are believed to have died since the uprising began in March last year. Ongoing fight: At least five people were killed and 32 wounded in a car bomb attack in southern Damascus . Destroyed: Local people in the Daf El Shok area in southern Damascus . look at the damage to their neighbourhood from a car bomb . The unraveling of the cease-fire marked the latest setback to ending Syria's civil war through diplomacy. Foreign military intervention is unlikely, raising the grim prospect of a drawn-out war of attrition between President Bashar Assad and those trying to topple him. The proposed four-day truce during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha had been a long shot from the start since international mediator Brahimi failed to get solid commitments from all combatants. Fighting dropped off in the first hours of the cease-fire Friday, but by the end of the day, activists said 151 people had been killed in bombings and shootings, a standard daily toll in Syria. In the remote eastern town of Deir el-Zour, assailants detonated a car bomb near a military police compound, then opened fire at those rushing to the scene, killing a total of eight people and causing extensive damage, the Observatory said. Syrian media denied there were casualties. The attack bore the hallmarks of Jabhat al-Nusra, a radical rebel-allied Islamic group that has rejected the cease-fire. The Syrian air force also bombed rebel positions Saturday during a fierce battle for control over the main road linking Aleppo, Syria's largest city, with the capital, activists said. Earlier this month, rebels seized Maaret al-Numan, a town along the highway and besieged a nearby military base, disrupting regime supplies to embattled Aleppo. The Syrian air force has responded with sustained bombing raids on area villages. By nightfall Saturday, at least 49 people had been killed across Syria, including 16 Syrian soldiers, activists said. The Observatory reported deadly regime shelling and sniper attacks in several locations, while Syrian state-media said rebels ambushed a number of military positions. Under attack: Free Syrian Army members take cover after a tank attack in the streets Aleppo on Tuesday . Military analyst Joe Holliday said neither side has an incentive to halt fighting, noting that rebels have disrupted regime supply routes to the northern provinces of Aleppo and Idlib. ""The regime can't accept the current military status quo without a fight and the rebels have no reason to since they believe they have the momentum,"" said Holliday, a researcher at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. Brahimi's spokesman declined comment on the apparent failure of his initiative. It's not clear what Brahimi's next move could be, since the international community is divided over the Syria conflict that erupted 19 months ago. Assad allies Russia and China have shielded the regime against harsher U.N. Security Council sanctions, while the rebels' foreign backers have shied away from military intervention. The U.S., meanwhile, is averse to sending strategic weapons to help the rebels break the battlefield stalemate, fearing they will fall into the hands of militant Islamists, who are increasingly active in rebel ranks. The al-Qaida-inspired Jabhat al-Nusra, for example, is believed to be on the front lines in Aleppo and near Maaret al-Numan. When Brahimi, the U.N.-Arab League envoy, first floated the idea of a holiday truce, he did not say what his long-term plan was. Anti-government: A woman curses Bashar Al Ashad after her family member was injured at a frontline hospital in Aleppo . Even a temporary reduction in violence during such a truce would not have been a springboard for talks between Assad and the opposition on ending the war. Syria's opposition says it will only negotiate if Assad resigns, a step the Syrian leader has refused to take. Some said Brahimi's initiative allowed a paralyzed international community to show briefly that it was doing something to try to end the war that has claimed more than 35,000 lives and displaced hundreds of thousands. Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Doha Center said the truce at least ""provides the illusion of movement, that something is being done, that the international community is still trying to find a solution."" Syrian state media accused the rebels of breaking the truce from the start. Yesterday, Lebanese broadcaster LBC TV said journalist Fidaa Itani, one of its employees covering Syria's civil war, was detained by the rebels and is being held in the town of Azaz near the Turkish border. The station quoted a local rebel leader in Azaz, Abu Ibrahim, as saying that rebels suspected Itani after he filmed many videos of rebels operations in Aleppo. Itani's Lebanese cell phone was closed when The Associated Press tried to reach him. The area also was the site of the May kidnapping of 11 Shiite Lebanese pilgrims who were on their way home from Iran. Two have been released while rebels say they will hold the others until Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group, apologizes to the Syrian people for supporting Assad.","Violence came on the second day of a .

It is the latest diet fad, urging  weight watchers to soak in ice-cold baths, give up fruit and gulp down black coffee before exercise. The self-published ebook, Six Weeks To OMG: Get Skinnier Than All Your Friends, has knocked the Dukan Diet from the top of the bestseller list and secured its author a seven-figure book deal in the US. But critics say the word-of-mouth hit, said to be inspired by reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex, cynically targets impressionable teenagers. Impressionable: Nutritionists and parents say the 'quick fix' diet could herald an epidemic of eating disorders (file photo) Nutritionists and parents say the ‘quick fix’ diet could herald an epidemic of eating disorders. Psychologist Deanne Jade, of the National Centre for Eating Disorders, said she was horrified by the diet’s premise. She added: ‘Teenagers will try anything. They’ll sit in a cold bath for hours. ‘This diet uses psychology against vulnerable young people and will encourage unhealthy competition to lose weight.’ Mrs Jade warned that sitting in ice-cold baths can seriously damage the immune system and said drinking black coffee stimulates the adrenal system, leaching minerals and vitamins from the body and damaging the thyroid. Criticism: The word-of-mouth hit targets impressionable teenagers, it is claimed . ‘You can lose weight in a million wacky ways. But you’ll put all it all back on again and you may have damaged your body, brain and appetite control for ever,’ she added. Dr Ian Campbell, a GP and weight loss expert, said: ‘My first thought is OMG! This book is encouraging extreme behaviour. ‘Teens are very vulnerable to diet fads, especially quirky ones like this. 'The advice is hypothetically correct but in reality will have little effect on weight loss and some of the advice like taking ice cold baths can be very dangerous. 'This is a cynical attempt to sell huge numbers of books and I certainly wouldn’t recommend it.’ The book, written by a British sports scientist and celebrity personal trainer who goes by the pen name of Venice A Fulton – real name Paul Khanna – claims to use a mix of nutrition, biochemistry, genetics and psychology to help readers lose 20lbs of body fat and reduce cellulite. Khanna denies specifically targeting teenagers and says he would never urge anyone under 16 or who was still growing to diet. A spokesman for Khanna said: ‘The reason Paul wrote the book is to cut through all the myths about dieting and change people’s lifestyle for the better. ‘If people get into healthy habits when they are young that’s obviously a good thing, but that’s not the primary aim of the book.’","Self-published book has knocked the Dukan Diet from the top of the bestseller list .

Nurses looking after patients in hospitals have also been forced to disinfect toilets and mop floors as hard-up NHS trusts cut spending on cleaning. More than half of NHS nurses told researchers that they believed cleaning services for their ward were inadequate, with about a fifth saying their hospital trust had made cuts in the last year. The survey of 1,000 nurses and health assistants revealed a third had cleaned toilets or mopped floors in the last 12 months. Burden: A ward is deep-cleaned at the Royal Free Hospital in London. A survey suggests that NHS nurses across the country are having to carry out more and more cleaning tasks themselves . Some also reported having to clean corridors, computers, nursing stations and offices. Two in five respondents said they had cleaned a bed area or single room vacated by a patient who was infectious. Four in five said they had performed the same task following the discharge of a non-infectious patient. Worryingly, almost three quarters of respondents said they had not been trained for such cleaning practices. And 37 per cent of nurses admitted that their trust would make a bed available to patients even if it had not been cleaned properly. The survey was conducted by the Nursing Times. 'This is not about saying nurses are too posh to wash,' the Royal College of Nursing's adviser on infection prevention and control, Rose Gallagher, told the magazine. 'Cleaning in hospitals is not the same as cleaning your own home.' A new specification on cleaning in hospitals was published last year by the Department of Health, National Patient Safety Agency and the British Standards Institution. Scaled back: About a fifth of nurses said their hospital trust had made cuts to cleaning services in the last year . However, the new guidelines did not specify the appropriate cleaning duties for nurses, the magazine reported. Tracey Cooper, president of the Infection Prevention Society, said: 'Nurses are the guardians of the standards of their wards. 'Cleaning has always been an integral part of what nurses do. 'The risk comes when there is a lack of clarity about process and who is responsible because then you get things that nobody cleans.' Andrew Jones, president of the Association of Healthcare Cleaning Professionals, said it was 'inevitable' that nurses would end up doing some cleaning of patient areas during out-of-hour periods. But he said that the best practice for hospital wards was to have a dedicated cleaner. 'When that happens we get better cleanliness standards and a better motivated workforce,' Mr Jones said. 'Some of the responses would suggest that's not the case as often as we would want.'","More than half of NHS nurses say cleaning services for their ward are inadequate .

A gang of fraudsters swindled more than £46,000 from the 'Boris Bike' scheme by making scores of bogus refund payments to their friends, a court heard today. Nana Boateng, 26, and Jose Dias, 27, allegedly organised sham repayments while working for SERCO, the company who organise the London Cycle Hire programme. The pair, who worked at the firm's Enfield offices, dishonestly arranged for refunds from the bike scheme to be channeled into the accounts of six friends over a three month period in 2010. 'Recipients': Samuel Njie, 26, left, and Darnel Joseph-Albert, 20, right, are among those said to have had received money from the sham Boris Bike refunds scheme . George Hayden, 29, left, and Sakinah MacAulay, 24, right, have admitted entering into an arrangement and will be sentenced later this year . The two men are jointly charged alongside former colleague Devina Joseph-Albert, 22, with one count of conspiracy to defraud. They are said to have 'conspired with together and with others unknown to defraud Transport for London by dishonestly arranging for the payment of refunds relating to the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme to which the recipients were not lawfully entitled.' Prosecutors claims the three channeled repayments through the accounts of George Hayden, 29, Zakir Bhad, 24, Darnel Joseph-Albert, 20, Samuel Njie, 26, Elizabeth Spencer, 36, and Sakinah MacAulay, 24. Elizabeth Spencer, 36, is another of the six said to have received payments from the bogus scheme in late 2010 . All six are charged individually with entering into an arrangement contrary to section 328 of the Proceeds of Crime act. Court documents state that each defendant 'entered into or became concerned in an arrangement which they knew or suspected facilitated, by whatever means, the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person.' The alleged offences took place between September 21 and December 16, 2010. Dias and Devina Joseph-Albert, both of Clapton, east London, appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today for a plea and case management hearing. Boateng, of (158) Kingsway, Enfield, north London, was not present for the brief hearing as the court heard he was having 'transport difficulties.' The three men did not enter pleas. Judge Stephen Robbins adjourned the hearing until March 7 and fixed a trial date for September 24. The gang allegedly arranged fake refund payments on Boris Bikes between September and December 2010 . Darnel Joseph-Albert, also of Clapton, east London, today pleaded not guilty to a single count of entering into an arrangement and will stand trial later this year.

A cautious boost was given to the housing market today as it emerged prices were rising –with London seeing a 5.4 per cent increase pushing the cost of an average home just shy of £300,000. And it was good news for most homeowners across the UK as lenders Nationwide reported a ‘surprisingly resilient’ increase of 1.1 per cent across the board pushing the average house price up to £163,822 despite a 0.2 per cent month-on-month fall in December. But just as prices in London rocketed, despite the deepening recession, it was a year of contrasting fortunes with Northern Ireland seeing a staggering drop of 8.9 per cent. Boost? Nationwide reported today a 1.1 per cent increase in UK house prices and stated it showed a 'surprisingly resilient' market . And the good news comes with a bitter aftertaste as Nationwide warned demand and supply remain weak, with mortgage approvals standing at around half their long-term levels. Its report said Northern Ireland and London stood out over the past 12 months, with the sharp drop in house prices felt by Northern Ireland being a marked contrast to the relative stability seen overall. Averaging £113,614, house prices in Northern Ireland have been slashed to half their 2007 peak levels and it was named as the worst-performing area for the fourth year in a row. Graph showing 2011 annual change in house prices . Homes in Northern Ireland have become more affordable than anywhere else in the UK however, with an average house price to earnings ratio of 4.1, down from 9.2 in 2007. Belfast was the worst-performing city over the year, with prices nose-diving by 19 per cent to average £161,326. At the other end of the spectrum, prices in London, which is popular with overseas buyers, are just shy of £300,000 and are 1.6 per cent below their all-time highs, compared with prices across the UK which are 10 per cent below their peak levels. Prices in the London areas of Camden, Greenwich, Hackney and Westminster have doubled over the last decade. But London is also the least affordable region, with a house price to earnings ratio of 7.4. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: 'The 1 per cent rise in house prices recorded over the past 12 months can hardly be described as a strong performance, but against a backdrop of anaemic economic growth and a deteriorating labour market, UK house prices are surprisingly resilient in 2011.' He continued: 'Although high rates of unemployment, falling real wages and the uncertain economic outlook kept many potential homebuyers on the sidelines, the supply side of the market was similarly squeezed. 'Thanks to continued low interest rates, the number of forced sales remained low. Together with a dearth in building activity in recent years, this prevented a glut of unsold homes from accumulating on the market. Warning: Nationwide say although the figures are positive mortgage approvals stand at half their long-term levels . 'This meant that although demand and supply were both weak, they remained relatively well-matched.' Scotland saw an annual house price fall for the second year in a row, but remains one of the more affordable areas of the UK, with a house price to earnings ratio of 4.5. Prices in Wales saw an increase slightly above the UK average, although North Wales and Mid and West Wales were the weakest-performing areas of the country and saw prices fall by 1 per cent. Despite the London price hikes, the Yorkshire city of Bradford was named as the best-performing city over the year, with prices rising by 10 per cent to average £158,401. Mr Gardner said labour market conditions are likely to remain 'challenging' in 2012, putting off potential buyers, which could tip the market in buyers’ favour. He said: 'The housing market in 2012 looks likely to be characterised by low levels of activity once again, with prices moving sideways or modestly lower over the course of the year.'","UK seen an average of  1.1 per cent growth in housing prices .

Show of respect: Governor General Bryce curtseyed to both the Queen and Prince Philip at a later meeting . By contrast Australia’s governor . general, Quentin Bryce – who was born in Brisbane – curtseyed to both . the Queen and Prince Philip. Miss Gillard, 50, was born in Wales and moved to Australia with her parents when she was four. Asked on Melbourne radio whether she . believed curtseying was demeaning, she said: ‘Some things are you, some . things aren’t. I made a choice and I thought I would feel most . comfortable with bowing my head. The advice was to do what comes most . comfortably and naturally.’ Miss Gillard is far from being the first public figure to have breached protocol with respect to the Queen. A rule concerning the sovereign has been set in stone for generations. 'Whatever you do, don't touch the Queen,' courtiers are apt to warn. But during . a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Michelle Obama put her . hand around the Queen for about 10 seconds . Finding . herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen had remarked on their height . difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs . Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder . - before both women moved gently apart.

In May, during the Queen's first official visit to the Republic of Ireland, Irish president Mary McAleese, like Miss Gillard, greeted the Queen with a simple handshake. Miss Gillard, however, is not even the first  Australian prime minister to have breached royal protocol. In . 1992 Paul Keating was given the nickname of 'Lizard of Oz' after he . touched the Queen's lower back with his arm as he guided her through a . crowd of people. In 2000 another Australian premier, John Howard, denied touching the monarch as he introduced her to MPs at a VIP reception. Faux pas: Don Romero broke royal protocol in 2010 by putting his hand on the Queen's back . Last . year, while visiting Canada, racehorse owner Don Romeo put his hand on . her back as she handed a trophy to the owner of the winning horse at the . Queen's Plate Stakes in Toronto. His . breach of protocol was swiftly corrected, however, when his . Jockey, Eurico Da Silva, executed two bows so low that his head was . level with the Queen's  waist. So how should one behave? There . are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or members . of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe tradition. For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women execute a small . curtsey. For those who prefer, it is in fact perfectly acceptable simply to shake hands. On presentation to the Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am'. For male royals the same rules apply, with the . title used in the first instance being 'Your Royal Highness' and . subsequently 'Sir'. For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is . conventionally 'Your Royal Highness' followed by 'Ma'am'. Source: www.royal.gov.uk .

Julia Gillard, the leader of the Australian Labor government, was born in Wales and moved to Australia with her parents when she was six. Last year Miss Gillard, pictured, indicated that when the Queen dies, her party should start the process of making the country a republic. Despite public opinion being divided over the question of severing all ties with the monarch, she said the Queen should be the country's final monarch. Miss Gillard, 50, said: 'What I would like to see as prime minister is that we work our way through to an agreement on a model for the republic. I think the appropriate time for this nation to move to be a republic is when we see the monarch change.' The issue is a contentious one for Australians, many of whom are British immigrants or descendants who still feel strong loyalty to Britain and the Queen. Australia is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies. As head of state in Australia, the British monarch serves a largely symbolic and ceremonial function, and is represented by the governor-general. In a referendum in 1999 the idea of a republic was rejected by 54 per cent of the population. The royal website, which gives . official advice on how to behave when meeting the Queen, states that . there are ‘no obligatory codes of behaviour – just courtesy’. It does say that many people wish to . observe the traditional forms of greeting and suggests curtseying for . women and bowing for men as appropriate. Republicans have pointed out that . other prominent women have also decided that a handshake is more . appropriate. Cherie Blair declined to curtsey to the Queen and wore . trousers on a visit to Balmoral in 1997. William Hanson, a British etiquette . and protocol expert, told Sydney’s 3AW radio that Miss Gillard should . have curtseyed  and worn a hat. ‘She is your prime minister, she is . representing the people, but the Queen  tops her, so as a sign of . respect, whatever  her opinion on the monarchy is, she should have . curtseyed. ‘Whatever you believe about the . monarchy, if you don’t curtsey, you don’t bow, it’s not going to bring . down the monarchy. You’re not making some grand gesture that’s going to . shake it to its core. It’s just a bit churlish not to do it.’ Matthew Archer, deputy chairman of the . Victoria branch of the Australian Monarchist League, described Miss . Gillard’s choice of a handshake as ‘rude and impolite’. As the controversy took over social . websites, prominent Australian TV host  Lisa Wilkinson tweeted: ‘Small . thing: saw GG [governor general] curtsey to Queen  but not the PM. Anyone know background to that?’ Crowds of well wishers wait for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at Floriade wharf for the flower show . But Miss Gillard insisted she had done . nothing wrong, pointing out that she was an admirer of the Queen and . believed many Australians held her with a great deal of affection and . respect – ‘and so do I’. She added: ‘I mean, what a life, what . an incredible life she’s lived over so many generations of change and to . see someone play such a steadfast role over so much change, I think, is . remarkable.’","Julia Gillard, a self-confessed republican, chose to bow instead .

Father: The son of Sir Nicholas Mostyn QC (pictured), one of Britain's top judges, possessed cocaine and ecstasy, a panel heard . The trainee barrister son of a former top divorce lawyer was caught with cocaine and ecstasy just weeks after being called to the Bar, a legal disciplinary panel heard today. Henry Mostyn, whose father Sir Nicholas was dubbed ‘Mr Payout‘ for his big money settlements, was arrested by police as he queued for an east London nightclub. Officers let the former Eton schoolboy and Oxford graduate off with a caution. But the Bar’s disciplinary tribunal officially reprimanded him and ordered him to pay £605 in fines and costs for his ‘lamentable lack of judgment’. The 25-year-old lawyer is one of four children of Mr Justice Mostyn and his ex-wife Lucy. As a divorce lawyer Sir Nicholas charged up to £500 an hour representing the rich and famous, with clients including Sir Paul McCartney and Earl Spencer, before becoming a family court judge. The QC, 54, walked out on his wife in 2010 to live with divorce barrister Elizabeth Saunders, 42. Her barrister husband Mark was shot dead by police marksmen during a siege off the King's Road in Chelsea in 2008. Mr Justice Mostyn was set to have his own 31-year marriage examined in a court battle with his former wife, 53, over their assets, including the nine-bedroom £6million family home in a 117-acre estate in Hertfordshire. But earlier this month the couple settled out of court and are understood to have agreed how to divide their assets, including the magnificent 18th Century Grade II-listed property. Henry Mostyn was called to the Bar in October 2011 and accepted as a pupil at prestigious London chambers 4 New Square. But in December he was arrested and held in a police cell after being searched by officers outside the nightclub. Marriage break-up: Sir Nicholas Mostyn (right) walked out on his wife in 2010 to live with divorce barrister Elizabeth Saunders (left) Police calculated the street value of the drugs was £40 before letting Mostyn off with a caution, the legal tribunal heard. Following his arrest he admitted the drugs were his and later confessed to his new colleagues. His chambers has since decided not to discipline him. Handing him the official reprimand for professional misconduct, Judge Julia Dias, QC, said:’ This is a very sad case. ‘You are very young and at the very start of your career, and have no doubt suffered very greatly already through the whole experience of being arrested, taken to the cells, and fingerprinted. ‘You are a pupil in a prestigious set of chambers, and four months ago you had a very promising career in front of you. I’ve absolutely no doubt you worked very hard to achieve that. ‘But the exercise of judgement is one of the most important qualities a barrister can possess. ‘Unfortunately, you demonstrated what can only be described as a lamentable lack of judgement. ‘You are a member of a profession which is expected to adhere to higher standards than ordinary members of the public.’ She said there was nothing to suggest Mostyn would have planned to ‘renounce the occasional use of recreational drugs’ had he not been caught. Elizabeth Saunders (left) began a relationship with Sir Nicholas after her barrister husband Mark (right) was shot dead by police marksmen during a siege off the Kings Road in Chelsea in 2008 . ‘The inference must be that, if you were not apprehended on this occasion, you would have continued to use them in the future.’ Richard Todd, QC, defending, had earlier asked for the Press to be excluded from the hearing because publicity would represent a ‘quadruple jeopardy’ for the young lawyer. Mr Todd added: ‘He most certainly has learned his lesson from the foolishness of his behaviour. ‘Everybody in his chambers is aware. Lethal: Footage showed Mark Saunders with a gun at his window before he was shot dead by police marksmen . ‘The caution itself has an impact - it will have a bearing on future applications, whether for [crown court] recorder or Queen’s Counsel. ‘It is going to have an impact on visas and a very lucrative line of work - working overseas. ‘Mr Mostyn wants to work in the commercial work and it may well be he’ll have to forget about that.’ In a statement read to the hearing, Mostyn - described as ‘ outstanding’ on his chamber’s website for his law school work before joining them - said he now realised taking drugs was ‘irresponsible and immature’ and vowed. He added: ‘This behaviour will not be repeated.’ Mr Todd said the pupil barrister had a record of ‘developing and using his skills for the benefit of the wider community’, having volunteered for charity work. In an August 2010 newspaper interview about his work at a former chapel in King's Cross helping former offenders get an education, Mostyn described his concern on his first tutoring visit when he encountered ‘a table with a pile of £50 notes, a huge bag of cannabis and wraps of other drugs’. He said it was ‘a little worrying, but it later emerged that these were only props for a play the ex-cons were putting on.’ Another newspaper feature on the project described Mostyn as ‘what you might call typically posh, with floppy hair and the eagerness to please of a new puppy’. Mostyn is quoted in the article as describing one ex-con, called Rikki, as 'so charming, so bright in a way that we are not. He'd been in and out of prison and had such a different life to my incredibly privileged upbringing'.","Henry Mostyn is son of former top divorce lawyer Sir Nicholas Mostyn QC, nicknamed 'Mr Payout' for his big money settlements .

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 04:04 EST, 31 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:19 EST, 31 May 2012 . A mother of three who was attacked by a flesh-eating bacteria that has killed others and forced them to have limbs amputated has survived the terrifying ordeal. Debbie Woolhead, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, fell over on the gravel path leading to her house but thought nothing of the tiny cut, which did not even rip her jeans. The following day, Ms Woolhead found that the cut had dramatically increased in size and was persuaded to go to hospital by her worried family. Nightmare scenario: Debbie Woolhead thought nothing of the tiny cut she suffered after falling on her driveway - but the injury quickly developed into a huge wound . Lucky: Ms Woolhead, her daughter Amie Carver and the rest of the family are delighted she has beaten the killer disease . Doctors diagnosed a flesh-eating disease and broke the news to her family that she was unlikely to survive. The disease, known as Necrotizing Fasciitis, has sparked panic in Georgia, where four victims have contracted it. Aimee Copeland, 24, woke from a coma last week after a quadruple amputation while grandfather Paul Bales lost his leg after cutting it in water. Lana Kuykendall, 36, was infected after she gave birth to twins at an Atlanta hospital and Bobby Vaughn, 32, was told doctors would need to rebuild his groin after his infection swelled to the size of a grapefruit. Bacteria in the bug releases toxins into the skin and muscle, forcing it to waste away. Grave consequences: The 43-year-old old was told she might not survive and could face a leg amputation, before a vacuum pump was attached to her leg to remove fluid from the wound . Toxic virus: Ms Woolhead spent four weeks in hospital after surgeons cut out the killer infection . Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. The bug may have been laying dormant in Ms Woolhead, but a scrape to her knee gave the virus a chance to spread. Ms Woolhead, 43, said: 'I was terrified. I had never heard of this disease and couldn't believe a tiny little . cut nearly killed me. 'The . attack meant my organs were affected and my lungs started failing. My . family were called in to say goodbye because nobody thought I'd pull . through, and I was told I could lose my leg.' She was rushed in to surgery and despite their fears, doctors were able to save her leg and her life. But . she was left with a shocking scar on her left leg, from her thigh to . her knee, where surgeons had cut out the killer infection. When she came round, her family were gathered at her bedside, including her distraught daughter Amie Carver, 21. Ms Woolhead said: 'The first thing my daughter asked me was if I still had my leg - . I had to reach under the covers to feel if it was still there. 'It looked like a piece of meat, I was so shocked to think the small cut I'd had before could have turned into that.' Fortunately Ms Woolhead's leg had not been amputated, but half of the skin on her leg had gone. Covered up: The mother of three before the fall, left, and today, right, after several skin grafts . Global problem: Georgia graduate Aimee Copeland, 24, underwent a quadruple amputation after the bacteria appeared in a cut on her leg . She would not have been so lucky if her brother-in-law, Russell Thilerow, had not insisted she seek medical attention. Mr Thilerow, 48, visited Ms Woolhead the day after her fall last November, and saw that the wound was weeping and she was complaining her leg was throbbing. He called an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital with a very low blood pressure and high temperature. As soon as doctors had examined Ms Woolhead and received blood test results, she was told they were taking her to theatre and she had to give consent for her leg to be amputated if required. Ms Woolhead spent four weeks in hospital, with vaccum pump treatment to remove fluid from her wound, and was given strong antibiotics to stop any further infection. She has since had a number of skin grafts done on the area, and is waiting for further surgery to reduce the scar. She said: 'I get aches from the skin grafts, and the scarred skin is very purple. 'It upsets me that I can't wear the clothes I want to, but then I realise how lucky I am to actually be alive.' Ms Woolhead is now able to walk, but faces several more rounds of surgery to help heal the skin on her leg . Doctors have told Ms Woolhead she was right to get to hospital as early as she did, or she might not be alive today. Her case was the first her surgeon had seen in 20 years, and her GP had never come across the illness. Because of the flu-like symptoms that come from having a flesh-eating disease, most people do not get help in time and it becomes too late to save their limbs, and sometimes their lives. Ms Woolhead added: 'It's scary to think that while it was just a virus I had, it can get in so easily through a tiny open wound and be so lethal.'","Doctors told Debbie Woolhead's family she was unlikely to pull through .

In a resounding demonstration of patriotic pride, royal fans drowned out attempts by a group of republicans to sabotage the Jubilee celebrations. When the anti-monarchists chanted: ‘Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie: Out, out, out’, the pro-royals all around spontaneously broke into a chorus of: ‘Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie: In, in, in!’ Their riposte drowned out the carefully planned protest and was followed up by an impromptu and rousing rendition of God Save The Queen. Not in the Jubilee spirit: Dozens of supporters of campaign group Republic gathered on the banks of the Thames near Tower Bridge, ahead of the arrival of the 1,000-strong flotilla led by the Queen . The demonstrators gathered at Tower Bridge in a stunt organised by the campaign group Republic. It bragged that hundreds of supporters from across the country would . descend on the capital for the ‘biggest and boldest anti-monarchy . protest of modern times’. In the end barely 60 showed up. Have you taken any pictures of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations? From The Thames to your town, we want to see them.

Holding placards and banners saying ‘Citizen not subject’, ‘Power to the . people’ and ‘Democracy not monarchy’, they taunted hundreds of families . nearby. Tensions between the two groups threatened to spill over and at one point security officers had to step in. Among the republicans was gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who said . in a speech that he had ‘nothing against the Queen’ but that he hated . the institution of monarchy. He said: ‘This Queen has not been a disaster. But you only have to look . back to the 1930s and King Edward VIII, a man who sympathised with the . Nazi regime.’ Mr Tatchell branded the monarchy ‘racist’ because there would never be a . black or Asian on the throne while the Windsor family held it, and he . accused the Queen of not representing all British people as she had . never visited a gay or lesbian organisation. Anger: A man holds a placard showing his feelings at the anti-monarchy protest that took place ahead of the pageant . Loud and clear: The protesters waved placards and banners saying 'citizen not subject', 'power to the people' and 'democracy not monarchy' as they called for the abolition of the monarchy .

Internet taunts: Rebecca Adlington, 23, re-Tweeted an abusive message sent to her - horus after winning another event in Barcelona . Olympic champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington has outed a Twitter troll who sent her an abusive message online - days after complaining about being subjected to vile taunts. The 23-year-old was called a 'whale' with a 'shark fin nose' in the abusive Tweet, she revealed yesterday hours after scooping gold in the 800m freestyle in Barcelona. The message was apparently sent by Callum Aspley, a 19-year-old Leeds Metropolitan University undergraduate who is himself a keen sportsman. However, he has denied sending it at 11pm on a Saturday night – and blamed it on one of his friends. Miss Adlington re-Tweeted the message for her 51,000 followers to see and said it was a ‘perfect example’ of the abuse she has had to endure. The swimmer, who won the 400m and 800m freestyle events at the Beijing Olympics, has vowed to ignore the internet altogether during this summer’s games. The abusive message said: ‘you shark fin nosed ******** , you belong in that pool you ****ing whale.’ Yesterday she received a stream of supportive Tweets from her followers. One fan wrote: ‘Becky, that's just a lowlife - ignore him because you know how talented you are x’ Miss Adlington, a 400m and 800m freestyle champion, revealed last week she has received a number of vile messages from 'idiots'. She said: ‘I used to read all the stuff about me. I learned very quickly not to do that. ‘It is awful. Even if there are ten nice comments you get one idiot. I’ve now given up. It upsets me or gets me angry. ‘They are to do with how I look, which has nothing to do with my performance in the pool. It’s just nasty comments about things  I can’t control. I can’t help the way I look.’ She said: ‘I don’t know how people expect to send a nasty message and not get blocked. I won’t be checking Twitter or going on it a lot during the Games. Abuse: The vile message sent from @CallumAspley re-Tweeted by Rebecca Adlington as the 'perfect example' of the offensive remarks she has received . Rebecca Adlington has said she will avoid the internet completely during the Olympics . ‘The messages of support are amazing but you do have the chance of someone saying something that is going to be annoying. You don’t want that added stress. You don’t want to be thinking about that. I think I will just tweet once it is over.’ It is not the first time Miss Adlington, of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, has been publicly abused over her looks. In 2009, BBC panel show Mock The Week was censured after broadcasting ‘nasty’ comments about her by comedian Frankie Boyle. Reflecting on the BBC incident, the swimmer said: ‘It’s hard for a woman. A guy doesn’t get comments on his weight or his looks. But for women it is difficult because we get criticised for our weight or how we look.’ The double Olympic champion won gold again on Saturday in the 800m Freestyle in Barcelona in the Mare Nostrum series. She put in an assured performance and recorded a championship record time of 8 minutes 19.86 seconds. Adlington led from the front and built up a lead of over two seconds at the halfway stage, finishing strongly ahead of Spain's Mireia Garcia Belmonte, the world short-course silver medallist. Today the student behind the Twitter account that the abusive message was sent from had not yet responded to a request for comment from the MailOnline. He has however taken his Twitter page down. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I didn't send the tweet myself, I was out with my mates and one of them got hold of my phone and so he must have sent it, it wasn't me. ‘I don't use Twitter a lot and I don't know how to delete a tweet. ‘Obviously I don't agree with what was said, I wouldn't say that kind of thing.’ He added that he does not usually use Twitter and would delete the message. The undergraduate, who plays for his university rugby team, previously played rugby and cricket for his secondary school in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He has refused to name who was actually behind the abusive message.

A female Minnesota middle school student was solicited by two male classmates to snap pictures of girls changing in the locker room in what began as a 'game,' prosecutors allege. Two boys at Century Middle School in Lakeville started a game in which they took photos of girls' buttocks in the hallway and forwarded the pictures to others, prosecutors said. As the game evolved, the boys recruited the girl to take inappropriate pictures in the school locker room — paying her $10 and a can of soda to do so. That girl then brought in one of her friends to take place in the 'game.' Game gone wrong: Four teenagers at Century Middle School are facing misdemeanor charges for allegedly taking and forwarding pictures of two girls undressing in a locker room . Violation of privacy: The boys allegedly recruited two girls to take pictures of their classmates changing in the locker room (file photo) The two girls took a total of five photos and one video of two other girls who were undressing in the locker room in May, prosecutors said. The images showed the backs of the victims partially undressed from the waist down. None of the images showed the victims naked, the AP reported. As all of the accused students are minors, none of them are named.Prosecutors said the images were then forwarded to the boys and eventually to others. The two boys, ages 13 and 14, and the girls, both 14, face gross misdemeanour charges related to the interference of privacy. Three also face criminal defamation charges, which are also gross misdemeanours. Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom said investigators believe up to 40 students saw the images, but there will be no additional charges. Twisted game: The two boys sent the locker room photos to as many as 40 students, prosecutors allege . He said authorities believe the four students who were charged were directly involved in either taking the images or getting others to take them. Mr Backstrom told the AP that he doesn't expect the four to spend time in juvenile detention or end up with permanent criminal records. 'What's important here is to make sure that they understand what they did was wrong, it was harmful to others, and it was against the law,' Mr Backstrom said. 'There's lines of decency that can quickly be crossed. And in this case, those lines were crossed. Everyone needs to learn from that.' -Prosecutor James Backstrom . He added that punishment could include community service or writing letters of apology to the victims and their families. The school issued additional sanctions, and 16 students were suspended, the district said in a statement Tuesday. Mr Backstrom said parents and teens need to understand that today's technology creates a great temptation, but sharing certain things can be illegal. Once an image is sent, he added, it doesn't come back. 'This is very serious,' he said. 'It's not a laughing matter.'

A three-year-old South African girl who suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body in an accident at a family barbecue is recovering after being given a new layer of 'cloned' skin. Doctors did not expect Isabella 'Pippie' Kruger to survive after she was seriously injured on New Year's Eve when a container of fire lighting fluid exploded at her home in Johannesburg. This week, little Pippie underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of skin flown in from America to be grafted onto her back, face, chest, arms and legs. Groundbreaking: Dr Ridwan Mia (pictured left) and Anice Kruger push three-year-old Isabella 'Pippie' Kruger into surgery . As part of a pioneering procedure, new skin was grown in a laboratory in Boston, Massachusetts, using cells harvested from Pippie's body. 'Everything went quite smoothly,' said Dr Ridwan Mia, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who performed the surgery on Pippie in a Johannesburg hospital. Dr Mia said he did not hold out much hope for the toddler's survival when he first met her in January. 'She had swelled to three times her size from her injuries,' he said. Under the knife: Anaesthetist Hazir Mukkadim (pictured left) checks Pippie Kruger during her pioneering surgery . Pippie has been in hospital since being admitted in January and during that time has battled pneumonia and kidney failure, as well as suffering several cardiac arrests. Doctors finally stabilised her so that this week's complex skin transplant surgery could be carried out. Dr Mia and his team used enough skin during the surgery to cover a mat and stapled it in pieces onto Pippie's wounds. On her face, doctors used absorbent stitch material instead of staples. The new skin had been created by cloning two samples of skin taken from one of the few parts of Pippie's body that escaped injury thanks to a diaper she was wearing at the time of the accident. Anxious: Little Pippie Kruger suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body after an accident at a barbeque at her home in Johannesburg, South Africa . The samples were sent to Genzyme laboratory in Boston where the skin was 'cloned' using mouse cells as a 'scaffold'. The procedure has been used many times in America and Europe, but rarely in Africa, Dr Mia said. On Monday evening, a special courier arrived from Boston with a stainless steel container carrying about 30 to 40 grafts of Pippie's new skin. Thin, delicate and almost transparent, the skin was taken to a Johannesburg hospital by ambulance from the airport. The skin needed to be grafted onto Pippie within 24 hours of leaving the laboratory. 'It was like clockwork the way the skin arrived on time,' said Dr Mia. Hoping for a quick recovery: Pippie Kruger's parents Erwin and Anice shown with son Arno . As Pippie was wheeled out of the surgery, her father Erwin Kruger expressed his relief to reporters. 'Everything looks great - it's fantastic,' he said. The little girl's mother, Anice Kruger, who has been by her daughter's bedside since the accident, looked equally relieved. For a week after the operation, Pippie will be wrapped in foam and protective dressing. She faces two immediate challenges. The first is ensuring that she remains free of infection. The second challenge is to prevent the new skin from sliding off and not taking. Skin grafts are delicate and prone to tearing. Doctors will have to keep Isabella sedated to minimise the risk of tearing. Bronwen Jones, founder of the Children of Fire, a local charity dedicated to providing medical treatments for young burn survivors, considers Pippie to be one of the luckier burn victims. She said survival in South Africa often depends on victims' proximity to a hospital and whether they are properly equipped. While there are no reliable statistics, Ms Jones estimates that around 15,000 children are seriously injured every year. In impoverished areas, the use of candles, paraffin stoves and open fires are often the causes of fire, particularly during the winter months. Tembisa Hospital, in the Gauteng province of South Africa, currently has 12 children in their burns unit. In the case of Pippie, access to medical care at an early stage as well as her parent's ability to raise money through social networking sites have all helped ease the burden. Dr Mia will be able to tell whether the skin has successfully taken after two weeks but he is optimistic given Isabella's determination. 'She is a fighter,' he said.","Doctors did not expect little Isabella 'Pippie' Kruger to survive after the horrific accident at a family barbecue in Johannesburg, South Africa .

Marilyn Nichols, who is in her 50s, suffered serious leg wounds when the aircraft she was flying with husband Bill plummeted in Derbyshire on Tuesday. Despite the catalogue of injuries and terrifying wait to be freed, plucky Marilyn was seen cracking jokes from her hospital bed only hours after the crash. While Bill, in his 60s, escaped with minor injuries, Marilyn, who runs the Haddon House Farm guesthouse in Bakewell, Derbyshire, was trapped in the wreckage for 45 minutes and had to be rescued by emergency workers. Lucky escape: Marilyn Nichols was trapped in the wreckage of her microlight for around 45 minutes after it crashed near Ashbourne, Derbyshire . She is now recovering in hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, having suffered four broken vertebrae, a broken finger, a broken wrist and damaged lungs . Mr Nichols recalled the ordeal. He said: 'We were climbing slowly and it all went wrong at 70 feet and we just spun into the ground. 'We’re both very lucky, especially to have survived two crashes. I have walked away from both with no injury. 'She’s had two surgeries now for her injuries, but she’s in good spirits, you’ll never get her down . 'She’s already talking about going back up again soon, but to be honest I’m not so sure, it seems like tempting fate a bit now. 'She was in control while we were taking off, but unfortunately when it went wrong she just froze at the controls, I tried to grab them but there was nothing that could be done at that height. 'It’s a shame, the aircraft had only done 100 hours since we got it in February. 'If we had been in any other microlight we wouldn’t be here now, the French-made one we used took a huge amount of the impact.' Trapped: Marilyn Nichols was trapped inside her microlight for 45 minutes. She suffered multiple fractures . The smash came almost exactly two years to the day since Marilyn broke both ankles in a microlight crash in Cheshire. Nick Case, a member of a microlight internet forum wrote: 'Crikey, lightning appears to have struck twice! Unfair! 'Most unfair, two less deserving people I find hard to imagine.

West Midlands Ambulance Service said Mrs Nichols had suffered `multiple serious leg injuries in the crash, and suspected pelvic injuries’. She was airlifted to University Hospital North Staffordshire for emergency treatment, while husband Bill, who suffered multiple minor injuries, was taken to the same hospital by land ambulance.

"By . Liz Hull . UPDATED: . 02:40 EST, 21 June 2012 . A bride who stole almost £200,000 from her boss to fund a lavish wedding was jailed for 20 months yesterday. Kirsty Lane, 29, was caught out after she invited managing director Peter Sutton to the expensive event. He became suspicious when his part-time accounts clerk laid on a . harpist, personalised fireworks, food by an award-winning chef and a . free bar for 100 guests at her nuptials in a mock-Tudor banqueting hall. Fraud: Kirsty Lane stole up to £200,000 from her company to pay for her lavish wedding to Graham Lane, 36, and was today jailed for 20 months . A closer look at the accounts then revealed she had been ripping off his firm for more than two years. Yesterday Lane, who was arrested before she had a chance to leave for her honeymoon in Mexico, was jailed after admitting ten counts of fraud. Afterwards Mr Sutton told how her ‘unbridled greed’ had almost ruined his video conferencing business. ‘I trusted her implicitly and this was how she repaid us,’ he said. ‘The wedding was the most lavish thing I’ve ever seen.’ Lavish: The Great Hall at Mains near Blackpool, Lancashire where the wedding was held - paid for with money stolen from the company . Preston Crown Court heard that as . Kirsty Rimmer, the bride-to-be had worked for four years for Pure AV in . Leyland, Lancashire, earning less than £15,000 a year. All the directors were invited to her wedding to Graham Lane, 36, who . she also kept in the dark about her crimes, in January last year. The . event at the Great Hall at Mains, near Blackpool, cost up to £40,000. Guests were served canapés with Buck’s fizz before a wedding breakfast . provided by celebrity chef Paul Heathcote’s firm. Sealed with a kiss: The couple's lavish wedding took place at Mains venue in Little Singleton, near Blackpool . Indulgent: Kirsty Lane, pictured with husband Graham, planned her dream wedding at a Tudor-built hall and laid on a free bar for guests along with two bands and a fireworks display . The bridesmaids were given jewel-encrusted iPods to take home, while . they and Mrs Lane even had matching black Ugg boots to protect them from . the cold when photographs were taken outside. The evening ended with a . fireworks display featuring the couple’s initials illuminated as the . centrepiece. Almost ruined: Lane's former boss Peter Sutton (pictured) said that her 'unbridled greed' had almost ruined his audio visual business . They left in a white limousine for a ‘minimoon’ in the Lake District before their honeymoon in Mexico. But within days of the wedding Mr Sutton was alerted to a problem with an invoice. On investigating, his suspicions aroused by the lavish wedding,  he . discovered that Lane, who has a daughter from a previous relationship, . had been using real invoices to existing suppliers to create extra . payments into her own account. The hearing was told she made 122 payments to herself between December 2008 and January 2011. Around £122,000 went into her own account, with £70,000 going into her . future husband’s account and a further £6,000 paid into a third account. Kirsten McAteer, prosecuting, said: ‘Once she started stealing money, . she couldn’t stop. She was afraid Mr Lane would leave her when he found . out the truth.’ The court heard that Mr Lane, who met his wife in 2007, was acquitted of . any wrongdoing at a trial in May. He believed the money was from . savings, her salary and bonuses. As well as the wedding, Lane spent the cash on other luxuries including a . 52in TV, a Tag Heuer watch and a jewel-encrusted case for her iPad. Jailing Lane, Judge Pamela Badley said her behaviour was ‘fraudulent . from the outset’, adding: ‘This was a cynical exploitation of the small . company for which you worked.’ Two people lost their jobs as a result of the firm’s ‘cashflow’ struggles following Lane’s fraud. Mr Sutton said that, due to added tax and VAT payments, she had cost the . company, which employs 18 staff, a total of around £300,000. He added: ‘How it didn’t sink us I don’t know. It is only through the . sheer determination of the rest of the team that we are still here.’ A day to remember... for all the wrong reasons: Kirsty Lane and her fiance Graham at their lavish wedding bash, which treated guests to an extravagant party . No expense spared: Canapes were served at the reception, along with Buck's Fizz amid ornate flower displays .","Kirsty Lane, 29, had an award-winning chef, free bar and personalised fireworks display at her lavish wedding to Graham Lane, 36 .

But this 100-year-old Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost has zoomed into the world record books, selling at auction for almost £5million following a fierce bidding war. It was originally bought for £1,000 in 1912 (almost £93,000 in today’s money) but has now gone under the hammer for £4,705,500, making it the most expensive Rolls-Royce ever sold at auction. Unique: This 100-year-old Silver Ghost Rolls-Royce has sold for a world-record price of £5million after a furious budding war at Bonhams . Through the roof: The lengthy auction saw two enthusiasts duelling for the pristine car as the bidding went up in increments of £100,000, smashing past the £2million estimate . In great nick: The six-cylinder, 7.3-litre car comes with perfect provenance and is still purring smoothly, doing about 15 miles to the gallon . What it lacks in gadgetry, the British-made classic more than compensates for with an extraordinary level of luxury that leaves its modern-day counterparts looking a little unsophisticated. Its gleaming interior fittings are made of silver and ivory, while the door panels are embroidered silk, with brocade tassels attached to silk window shades for privacy. The passenger footrest hides a full picnic set for four, a china tea service, complete with an alcohol-fuelled burner and kettle to heat the water, and a set of six decanters – three in sterling silver and three in leather-wrapped glass. The sale took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex on Friday. Auctioneers had expected it to sell for around £2million and were astonished when the bidding between two rival collectors topped £4million. James Knight, from Bonhams auctioneers, said: ‘There were three bidders, then one of them dropped out at £2.3million and we thought it would end there. Traveling in style: The design chosen by its original owner echoed the luxurious 'Pullman' Railway carriages pioneered by American George Pullman . Luxurious: The elegant passenger compartment . (left) complete with 29 bevelled glass windows and (right) the stylish . steering wheel . ‘But then another bidder entered and the bidders were duelling. It went up in increments of £50,000, and then £100,000, and then back down to £50,000. ‘It went on and on and on and was the longest car sale I have ever witnessed. It was pure theatre. Everyone was very respectful but when the price reached a milestone, like £3million, there was an intake of breath. ‘The bidders were duelling and when the hammer came down there was spontaneous applause. ‘It was fitting because the car is celebrating her centenary.’ The car was commissioned by Rolls-Royce connoisseur John M. Stephens, who also bought the first Silver Ghost the luxury car-maker produced in 1906. The body was built by former royal carriage-maker Barker’s of Mayfair, which had previously built coaches for King George III and Queen Victoria. Standing the test of time: The 7.3-litre, six-cylinder engine is still purring smoothly and is capable of doing around 15 miles to the gallon . Mark of history: A plaque bearing the vehicle's chassis number of 1907 . Touch of class: The original owner employed the services of the best coach-making company, Barker and Co. Ltd, to do the bodywork . Classic designs: One of the car's brake lights. The Rolls-Royce still had its headlights, carriage lights, rear lights and inflatable tyres when it went up for sale . Miniature version: The Corgi toy of the roller, pictured, is a very accurate copy of the real Silver Ghost. The real car was sold by Bonhams at the Goodwood Festival of Speed . Unlike most car enthusiasts of his . time, Mr Stephens, from Croydon, South London, asked the makers not to . include a glass division window between the driver and the passengers as . he wanted to drive it himself rather than rely on a chauffeur. The car even had an early speedometer – an important addition given that a 20mph speed limit was introduced in 1912. The . car’s distinctive cream and green design echoed the luxury ‘Pullman’ Railway carriages of the time, and it was known as a Double Pullman . Limousine. But it was nicknamed ‘the Corgi Silver Ghost’ in the 1960s after the toy-maker based its Silver Ghost toy car on this model. Mr . Stephens’s car is believed to be the only one of its kind to survive . with its full interior and bodywork, as many Rolls-Royces from the era . were converted into ambulances during the First World War. Auctioneer Bonhams said: ‘It is a . statement of refinement, grace and gentility that for many defines the . qualities and the Edwardian period in which Rolls-Royce established the . unsurpassed reputation it still enjoys today.’ The . identity of the anonymous telephone bidders has not been revealed but . sadly Bonhams has confirmed the car will now be leaving Britain once . more.

Forget swimming pools and balconies, it's a red-brick, semi-detached, council home in Corby that multi-millionaire couple Charlie and Penelope Gillion really want. It's an unlikely choice, but Britain's most modest lottery winner and his wife have vowed to buy their beloved home of 30 years from the local council. Down-to-earth Charlie Gillion, 64, is one of 12 bus drivers . in Corby who sensationally scooped a massive £38million jackpot on the . Euromillions earlier this year. Charlie, along with his wife Penelope, 65, a retired . cleaner, were left overwhelmed by the win and sensibly chose to sit on their . stash until they decided what to spend their fortune on. Now the humble couple are patiently waiting for Corby Borough . Council to organise the deal, after being putting on a waiting list. Incredibly, the winners have not even been on holiday to . celebrate their lottery scoop and admitted to happily ‘plodding along as before’. The couple have shunned the idea of the ‘highlife’ and ‘flash . mansions’, instead happy to stay in their double-fronted, red-brick home to . stay close to their family and neighbours. Penelope, originally from Scotland, said: ‘We are still here . at the moment. We have not moved on yet. We are still waiting to buy this . place. ‘We told the council and have been waiting nine or ten weeks . but they have not even been round yet to value the place. ‘They said there are so many other people applying to buy . that we have to wait. We are just hoping they get back to us shortly. The Gillians have shunned fancy mansions to buy their semi-detached council home, pictured on the left-hand side, in Corby . ‘We won’t be leaving Corby as all our close family are here. ‘We have not done much else really, Charlie still has the . same car, we’ve not been anywhere - nothing has changed much, we are still just . the same. ‘We are just plodding along as before - we are not worried . about buying flash cars or flash mansions or anything like that. ‘We have not started living the millionaire life style and . we never would it has not changed us a bit. You get some people who like to . live the highlife but not us.’ The generous couple have already made surprise visits to family . to share their winnings and plan to hand their current council house over to . their granddaughter and her young son in the future. Penelope who has three children, ten grandchildren and six . great grandchildren added: ‘We won’t be leaving Corby as all our close family . are here.’ Neighbours heaped praise on the couple, proudly revealing . their good fortune hadn’t changed them at all. Margaret Donnachie, 64, said:  ‘They’re great neighbours, very kind, very . considerate. ‘Everyone gets along well and it’s the kind of place where . people really know their neighbours, we’ve know them for 30 years. Charles Gillion, 64, pictured second from right, was one of 12 bus drivers in Corby who sensationally scooped a massive £38million jackpot on the Euromillions earlier this year . ‘They still shop in Asda, I still see them walking to the . shops, there are no airs and graces. ‘They’re just lovely people, I wish it were me but I’m happy . for them too.’ Another neighbour said the Gillions were really ‘genuine’ people.

Ireland's former richest man Sean Quinn faces jail after being found guilty of contempt, the final twist in his astonishing downfall. The former business tycoon blocked the Irish state from seizing up to £500million worth of property after he went bankrupt. Mr Quinn and his son Sean and nephew Peter Darraghwere found to have defied an order at the High Court in Dublin over the family's international property portfolio. The lawsuit, brought by the State-owned bank which was rebranded last year to become the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, claimed they shifted assets from as far afield as Ukraine and Russia into new ownership as it pursued 2.8 billion euro (£2.23 billion) in debts. The contempt ruling was delivered by Mrs Justice Elizabeth Dunne at the Four Courts in Dublin. It is the latest court battle the Fermanagh-born businessman has lost after he secured bankruptcy in Northern Ireland only for it to be overturned and a Dublin court then to declare him bankrupt. The 65-year-old was estimated to be worth €4.5bn (£3.9bn) at his financial peak, owning a personal helicopter and a palatial multi-million property in County Cavan. Palatial: An aerial view of Sean Quinn's house in Ballyconnell, County Cavan . The contempt lawsuit is one of a series of cases across several jurisdictions as the zombie bank tries to recover a 500 million euro (£402 million) international property portfolio to cover unprecedented debts run up by Mr Quinn in secret and ill-fated share deals in Anglo. Potential punishment for contempt of court in Ireland ranges from fines and seizure of property to a jail sentence. In a hard-hitting judgment criticising the Quinns, Mrs Justice Dunne ruled that Sean Quinn's evidence was not credible. Flyabout: The personal helicopter of tycoon Sean Quinn who declared he could not pay bank loans . She said it was 'impossible to accept the evidence of Sean Quinn Senior that he had no hand, act or part in Quinn business after April 2011'. A receiver had been appointed by that time to the Quinn Group after Sean Quinn ran up the huge debts on a stock market gamble that the Anglo share price would keep rising. The judge went on to say that his son Sean was not telling the truth and that the evidence of nephew Peter Darragh Quinn was 'most untruthful'. The Quinns are expected back in the High Court on Friday, when arguments will be put forward for further action to be taken against them over the contempt. Couple: Tycoon Quinn and his wife Patricia. He hurried from the court and as he got into a car declared: 'I am not dishonest' Happier days: Quinn at the wedding of his daughter Ciara . Judge Dunne warned the Quinns that, given the seriousness of the contempt case, it would be difficult to persuade her against enforcing action with 'a punitive element as well as coercive'. Quinn senior hurried from the court and as he got into a car declared: 'I am not dishonest.' His son and Peter Darragh were also present for the ruling. Mrs Justice Dunne said the bank had faced considerable obstacles, not to say obstruction, and had been opposed at every step as it chased the Quinn assets. Mr Quinn Senior was described as evasive and unco-operative and accused of making lengthy criticisms of Anglo rather than answering questions in court. 'I am satisfied that he was au fait with the arrangements taking place to implement the plan,' the judge ruled. Mr Quinn Junior was found to have offered some evidence that was 'simply unbelievable', including when pressed on why he was in Kiev on August 30 2011. Business empire: The Quinn Group in Blanchards town where Sean Quinn made his multi-million fortune before his downfall . 'As a general overview I have to say that I was not impressed with the manner in which they gave evidence,' she said. 'Peter (Darragh) Quinn was evasive, less than forthright, obstructive, unco-operative and, at times, untruthful. 'He conveyed the impression of someone reluctant to be in court, to say as little as possible and of someone who simply did not tell the whole truth.' He would have said and done anything to keep assets away from the former Anglo, the judge ruled. The bank's pursuit of assets held by the Quinns has led to a paper trail and court cases in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Russia, the Ukraine, Cyprus, Sweden and Belize. The contempt case was told that, in the Cypriot court battle, misleading affidavits were sworn by the Quinn family. The judge said that, during his evidence, Mr Quinn Senior spoke of the Quinn Group and its importance as an employer of 7,000 people. 'One can appreciate the ability that led to the creation of such a business empire,' she added. 'Sean Quinn Senior also spoke of the honourable, respectable way in which the businesses comprised in the Quinn Group were run. 'I wish I could say the same about the manner in which the respondents have dealt with the adverse circumstances in which they now find themselves having regard to the collapse of the Quinn business empire.' The dispute between Anglo and the Quinns centres on the bank's attempt to recover 2.8 billion euro (£2.3 billion). 'Instead of trying to repay the admitted debt due, the Quinn family, and in particular the respondents, have taken every step possible to make it as difficult as can be to recover any amount due,' the judge continued. She described efforts to hide assets as complex, complicated and costly and said they were done in a blatant, dishonest and deceitful manner. 'They have consciously misled courts here and elsewhere,' the judge said. 'They have sought to deprive Anglo of the assets which would go some way to discharging an admitted indebtedness. 'The behaviour of the respondents outlined in evidence before me is as far as removed from the concept of honour and respectability as it is possible to be.' In a statement, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation said it had been frustratingly obstructed in trying to recover the property portfolio. Mike Aynsley, the bank's chief executive, said: 'Bringing this contempt motion was a valid and necessary step for IBRC to take. 'The proven planned, covert and illicit actions taken by the Quinns and connected parties have resulted in millions of euros being lost or put at risk. 'IBRC will continue to seek to remedy this and recover as much of the remaining assets as possible on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.'","Sean Quinn has been found in contempt of court for putting assets beyond the reach of the former Anglo-Irish Bank .

Mrs Taylor-Moore, of Overseal, Derbyshire, is still spending . six hours a day at her son's bedside at the Royal Derby Hospital. He is continuing to amaze hospital staff with his progress and recently tried to help nurses put on his own underwear. He suffered a fractured skull, and had . his eye socket rebuilt, using bone taken from his thigh. After surgery . he slipped into a coma and had been in a vegetative state ever since. Mathew, 30, of Spring Cottage Road, . Overseal, near Swadlincote, south Derbyshire, had been in the country . for almost two years teaching English and PE. His girlfriend, Anda, found him languishing untreated in a hospital after going missing on Saturday, July 9. Mathew’s family have spent an astonishing £250,000 on his medical treatment. Anda stayed by his side for months . with his mother, Heather Taylor-Moore, and sister, Karen Taylor, while . he was moved between hospitals in Bali and Singapore. Mrs Taylor-Moore said: 'He is nodding . his head for yes and shaking for no, and responding to people when they . ask him to do things. 'Sometimes he will point to things. He has movement in his hands. He has even tried to help the nurses put on his pants. 'But he does have bad days too, . particularly when he develops an infection. I am trying to keep . positive. We have been there every day, for six hours, for 11 months. He . is my child and that is what you do.' His fiancee, Handayani 'Anda' Nurul, . recently returned to Bali after spending three months at his bedside. She keeps in regular contact by phone. Mathew had been teaching in Bali for . 18 months when he was hurt in a crash on one of the country’s . notoriously dangerous roads in July last year. As he was uninsured at the time, his . family and friends had to come up with the cash to pay rapidly mounting . medical bills, which led to a mammoth fund-raising effort. In October, Mr Taylor was transferred . back to Britain. Miss Nurul managed to secure a visa so . she could join them at his bedside for three months, but after that she . was forced to return home to Bali, where she studies Dutch literature . at the University of Indonesia.

Miles apart: Mr Taylor's family were amazed when he moved his hand and tears streamed down his face as his fiancee spoke to him over the phone from the other side of the world . He said: ‘Coma arousal programmes are often used to try to . stimulate patients who are in reduced states of consciousness, such as a . coma or a persistent vegetative state. ‘These carefully planned periods of . stimulation – in the form of sound, touch, smell and taste – are . combined with periods of complete rest in order not to overload the . person’s senses. ‘While each individual case is . different, in general terms the longer a person remains in a state of . reduced consciousness, the less likely they are to make a full recovery. ‘We have heard of several examples of . people waking from comas and going on to make good recoveries and live . happy, fulfilled lives. ‘Examples like this demonstrate that coma arousal programmes may well be effective.’","Mathew Taylor, 31, has been unconscious for ten months after horrific motorbike crash .

A jealous wife lured her cheating husband into bed and plunged a knife through his heart after they had sex. Nooshin Nedjah, 30, became convinced that her husband Medi Sangachin had married someone else while he was visiting his family in Iran. She told Mr Sangachin, 36, that she had a 'surprise' for him before the attack. On Friday she was jailed for 11 years over the attack at the couple's flat in Leeds. Mr Sangachin, 36, suffered massive blood loss after the kitchen knife entered his heart and only survived the attack thanks to the skill of one of the country's leading surgeons, Dr Patrick McGoldrick. Nedjah was cleared of attempted murder after a trial at Leeds Crown Court, but was convicted of wounding with intent. The jury heard the couple are both originally from Iran and married in June last year after starting a relationship in 2010 when they met on a bus. They set up home at the first floor flat where neighbours got the impression they were not a happy couple. In December last year Mr Sangachin visited his family in Iran. He told his wife he had been unfaithful to her and Nedjah became increasingly jealous as she believed he had remarried during his trip. The court heard Nedjah persuaded her husband to come to bed on the afternoon of February 17 this year and they had sex. Afterwards she told him she had a 'surprise' and told her husband to cover his eyes as they were naked in bed. Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, said: 'At that point she produced a sharp knife, which she had fetched from the kitchen, and plunged it with force into his chest, penetrating his heart and his left lung and narrowly missing the coronary artery.' Nedjah was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court to 11 years in prison on Friday . Nedjah, who came to the UK to study English, initially failed to help her husband as blood pumped from the wound but eventually dialled 999. Nedjah tried to claim her husband had inflicted the injury upon himself then said he was stabbed accidentally as the pair struggled. Matthew Bean, for Nedjah, said his client had been receiving treatment for mental health problems. The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier, said: 'You lured him to have sex with you in order to get him into the position where you could strike him as you did.'","Nooshin Nedjah jailed for 11 years over kitchen knife attack .

Worrying: A review of France's state finances - requested by President Francois Hollande - has revealed a massive £27billion shortfall in its economy, threatening the country's deficit goals . New French President Francois Hollande – elected on an anti-austerity platform – was yesterday told 'unprecedented' cuts were needed to plug a gaping hole in the country's budget. France's accounting watchdog warned the government needs to find £35billion in savings over the next two years to drag it out of the 'danger zone'. Didier Migaud, head of the country's Cour des Comptes audit body, said repairing the battered public finances was 'crucial' and must not be delayed. 'It will require an unprecedented brake on spending and higher taxes,' he said. The tough message was a blow to socialist Mr Hollande, who declared that 'austerity can no longer be inevitable' after he defeated Nicolas Sarkozy in May and has repeatedly called for Europe to focus on growth. France, which has lost its AAA credit rating, ran up a deficit of £83billion last year – or more than five per cent of GDP – and its £1.4trillion debt amounts to £50,000 per household, or 86 per cent of GDP. The auditor said savings of up to £8billion were needed this year and a further £27billion next year to get the deficit under control and meet Mr Hollande's budget target of cutting it to three per cent of GDP next year and eliminating it in 2017. Mr Migaud warned action must be taken now to prevent a backlash on the financial markets and a possible bailout. French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault will outline the socialist's economic plan today and finance minister Pierre Moscovici will publish details of a revised budget tomorrow. 'There will be tax increases, there will be spending cuts,' Mr Moscovici admitted last week. 'But we must avoid a budget that hurts economic activity.' Mr Hollande's task will be made even more difficult by weak economic growth. The auditor forecast expansion of 0.4 per cent this year and one per cent in 2013. Hollande's approval rating has already slid by seven points to around 51 per cent as the public fears more economic gloom. The government will revise down official growth forecasts as it uses the audit to rework the 2012 budget, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said in a newspaper interview. The Court of Auditors-- a quasi-judicial body responsible for overseeing public accounts - said it had not uncovered any new skeletons left by the outgoing government of conservative former President Nicolas Sarkozy. It pointed to 1.2 to 2.0 billion euros of likely overspending this year in areas like defence, agriculture and housing, but said this was normal. Bad news: The government plans tax rises on the wealthy and on companies to adjust the 2012 budget, but unpopular welfare and civil service job cuts are likely next year. The Eiffel Tower is pictured in Paris . Grim: The president of the French Court of Auditors, Didier Migaud, poses with the court's report on the country's finances . The main obstacle to Hollande's . pledge to honour France's European Union deficit targets of 4.5 per cent . of GDP this year and 3.0 per cent in 2013, the court said, was a . revenue shortfall due to over optimistic assumptions on economic growth. The . crunch year for public finances would come in 2013, the auditors said, . when the government must make the biggest step in deficit reduction in . the face of weak growth, a persistent euro zone crisis and rising . domestic anger over high unemployment. 'Respecting . the 2013 public finance target is particularly important for France's . credibility with the euro zone gravely affected by a debt crisis,' the . report said. Even if Paris . meets this year's target, public debt is on course to top the 90 per . cent of GDP level at which economists see a negative impact on growth, . making it vital that the government act quickly. 'If the dynamic of public debt does . not slow, the risk premium demanded by investors will raise debt . servicing costs and limit still further the room for manoeuvre,' it . said. Government . sources have already said that a revised 2012 budget, due before the . cabinet on Wednesday, will include some 7.5 billion euros in new taxes, . including increases in wealth tax and a financial transactions tax. But . the auditor's report will strengthen the case for tough spending and . tax measures in the 2013 budget, due in the autumn, potentially helping . the government face down opposition from powerful trade unions and its . own far-left political allies. The . Court of Auditors said growth this year would be around 0.4 per cent, . less than the 0.7 per cent assumption in the old budget. For 2013, the auditors assumed growth of 1 per cent, well shy of the previous government's 1.75 per cent forecast. The new government appeared to agree. Moscovici told Le Figaro he would base a 2012 corrective budget on a . growth forecast of 0.4 per cent or less, and the 2013 plan on output . expansion of 1.0 to 1.3 per cent. While neighbouring Germany was starting to reduce its debt, France's was still climbing, draining the competitiveness of its economy, the court said. France urgently needed to rein in one of the highest state spending levels in Europe, at 56 per cent of GDP. 'Budgetary adjustments should be aimed mainly at spending,' the report said, noting that efficiency gains would allow this to be done without affecting the quality of services. It said job cuts were indispensable to curb mounting payroll costs. The . Court of Auditors is headed by Didier Migaud, a former Socialist . politician appointed by Sarkozy, giving its recommendations bipartisan . authority. In the short . term, the auditors accepted that tax rises were needed to avoid drastic . spending cuts which would choke off a recovery. They recommended reductions to tax exemptions and a short-term increase in Value-Added Tax and the CSG welfare charge. The court report did not take into . account measures approved by the government since it took office in May, . including a two percent rise in the minimum wage. Change: The state auditors said it had not uncovered any new skeletons left by the outgoing government of conservative former President Nicolas Sarkozy. He is pictured with his wife Carla Bruni leaving the Elysee Palace after Francois Hollande was sworn in as President . Its figures also did not include a recent EU decision on taxation of foreign investment funds, which could cost France up to 9 billion euros, nor the extra cost of France's share in a 100 billion euro zone bailout for Spanish banks, agreed last month. If the 33 billion euros next year were split evenly between spending reductions and new taxes, the government could find the 16.5 billion euros of expenditure savings by slowing state spending increases to the pace of inflation, the auditors said. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, due to set out his legislative agenda to parliament on Tuesday, has said the central government - which accounts for four-fifths of the deficit - would hold spending flat between 2013 and 2015.","President Francois Hollande now has task of explaining to voters that sweeping costs cuts will be .

A pensioner who helped steal £1600 from a woman who had been just been killed in a horrible crash has escaped jail. Pensioner Terence Gatter was driving when his passenger, Marc Kervin saw . a handbag in the road and the pair split the money they found inside. The court heard that the 66-year-old was ‘motivated by pure greed’ when . he took the £800 from Sarwari Ashraf’s bag as she lay dead in the middle . of the road just a few feet away. Gatter, of Sale, pleaded guilty to theft by finding at Manchester . magistrates court but escaped a jail sentence due to ill health . The court heard he was driving past the scene of the crash when Mr Kervin, spotted the bag. Kervin ran into the middle of the road to retrieve it and the pair split the £1,600 between them. The court heard neither was aware of its connection to Mrs Ashraf, who had been hit and killed by a lorry 130ft away. Because of the theft, it was impossible to identify her, leaving her . family to make the agonising realisation when they could not find her . the next day. District judge Wendy Lloyd said: ‘This was a horrible crime. You and Mr . Kervin both knew that in taking that bag, its contents and taking the . cash that you were going to cause great distress to someone. ‘You were both motivated by pure greed. It was cash you wanted. You showed absolutely no pity for your victim.’ Mrs Ashraf, a grandmother, died instantly when she was in collision with . the articulated lorry as it was being driven through the rush hour. The ensuing impact at 9.54am on March 29 in Longsight, Manchester, . propelled her handbag and shoes up to 130m from the rest of her body. Opportunist: Kirvin clutches the handbag containing £1,600 as he approaches one of the dead woman's shoes lying on the ground . Grasping: Kirvin reaches down for Mrs Ashraf's handbag, which was thrown some 130 metres from her body after she was hit by the lorry . Shameless: Marc Kirvin, 46, is seen on CCTV carrying the decapitated woman's shoes. A witness said a man calmly picked up the footwear and handbag - which where catapulted 100 yards from her body . The grisly nature of the incident led to ghoulish onlookers taking sick . pictures of the gruesome scene and posting them on Twitter. This left her family waiting an agonising 12 hours to find out if their mother and grandmother had been taken from them. Sarwari Ashraf, 62, was killed instantly on when she was struck by the lorry in Manchester . She added: 'She was of Islam faith and it is extremely important that . the body is buried within 24 hours. 'She said it was only when crime . stoppers received intelligence that police were led to Kirvin's door . step. The judge said she believed Mr Kervin - who was jailed for his part last . month - was the main perpetrator, adding: ‘But for him, I don’t think . you would have even been part of it.’ Defending, Paul Sumner said Mr Gatter had used the money to pay bills, not luxuries. It was later found he had used it to pay for £400 council tax and £118 car tax. He had been in and out of hospital after suffering two strokes and being involved in a hit-and-run himself. In a previous hearing Gatter said they were driving along and saw a bag . in the road and simply deduced that a person had left it on the roof of . their car and drove off. Gatter initially denied splitting the cash. He told police: 'I'm not . like that, neither is Marc. There's nothing in my house, I would not . know about any money. The CCTV shows that Mr Gatter stopped stopped at the junction Mr Kirvin . exited and proceeded to pick up the bag and shoes, which had been in the . middle of the junction. By this time the victim had died from her . injuries. A purse, disability badge, national insurance number, mobile phone, house keys and around £1,600 cash was inside the handbag. In a statement, Mrs Ashraf's family said the theft of the bag created a . prolonged anguish and suffering to them and they even had to change . their loved-one's house locks.

Crooked conman: Thomas Scragg, 56, used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle for himself and his henchmen . A businessman has been given one of the longest sentences for fraud in British criminal history after masterminding a £34million tax scam. Thomas Scragg was jailed for 17 years after a court heard he laundered millions of pounds to fund a luxury lifestyle. Police began investigating his criminal empire six years ago when they were tipped off that his henchmen, Carl and Anthony Johnson, were living as millionaires without obvious means of income. Officers discovered the brothers, who had a string of convictions for witness intimidation and violence, were providing ‘protection services’ to Scragg. Investigations found he paid them £2.4million from a payroll fraud that had already come to the attention of HM Revenue and Customs. They splashed out on luxury hotels, exclusive restaurants and various high-performance sports cars, including a Lamborghini Murcielago, Bentley Continental, Porsche Cayenne and Ferrari Spider. The brothers, to be sentenced at a later date, also kitted out their homes with state-of-the art security equipment. Carl had bulletproof glass put in his home, while Anthony rebuilt his house with a cinema room, stables and dog kennels. They were only caught after neighbours, who became suspicious over their new-found wealth, went to police upon hearing them boasting, 'crime does pay', police said. The racket saw Scragg, 56, use his business Moya Payroll, which managed the wages of construction firm staff, to siphon off £26million in tax from 2002 to 2007. Workers would be paid in cash without deductions for tax being made, while VAT for work carried out by the construction firms – many of which were set up by Scragg – also went unaccounted. West Midlands Police then uncovered an additional £8million of stolen PAYE tax over a ten-month period from April 2007. Scragg, 56, from Hockley Heath, West Midlands, was jailed for 13 years in November 2010 and was given a further four years in March 2011 – the second longest sentence ever received in Britain for a white-collar crime. His co-defendant, 60-year-old Paul Phillips from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was jailed for nine years for his part in the set-up. Scroll down for video .

Carl, 49, and his 51-year-old brother, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, claimed their wealth came from running a security firm. But it paid nothing in tax. The verdicts at Birmingham Crown Court were the last of 11 convictions related to the scam. Mark Harris, Mark Kenny and Sital . Sheamar were all charged with conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to . pervert the course of justice and money laundering after they illegally . tried to release the equity in Scragg’s fraudulent company. All three were jailed in March this year. Harris for 18 months, Kenny, who was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, for 13 months and Sheamar for three and a half years. Detective Chief Inspector Shaun Edwards . from West Midlands Police said: 'This was fraud and money laundering on a . massive scale; it deprived the public purse of millions of pounds and .

Angry taxi drivers caused major disruption on Westminster's roads today in a protest over their ban from dedicated Olympics traffic lanes. Tourists in Parliament Square were greeted with blaring horns as more than 200 black cabs arrived shortly before 2pm. The demonstration was organised as pictures revealed that markings on the controversial lanes are already becoming worn - 10 days before the Games begin. Standstill: Taxi drivers stopped their vehicles in the road outside the Houses of Parliament . The route in Park Lane was only painted a week ago, but already the markings are beginning to fade outside the Dorchester Hotel. Use of the lanes will be restricted to Olympics officials, athletes and other approved vehicles. The routes have been nicknamed ‘Zil lanes’ after the limousines used to ferry communist leaders in specially reserved lanes from the Kremlin during the Soviet era in Russia. Restrictions do not come into force in central London until July 25, but taxi drivers have already made their grievances known. Fading out: Markings on the Olympic lane in Park Lane, London, are already becoming worn . Embarrassing: Paint on the Games lane on Park Lane is already coming away . Patchy: Painting on the route was only completed by workmen a week ago . Jonathan Myers, of the United Cabbies group union, said: 'There will be no access to these lanes for any traffic apart from the Olympics family. 'Taxis are excluded, which is unacceptable and wrong. This is a working city and we need to get around and do our job.' A key road junction on access routes to the Olympic mountain biking course will not be completed in time for the Games. Roadworks have overrun for almost two months at Sadlers Farm, where visitors are expected to travel on their way to the course at Hadleigh Farm Country Park in Essex. Some 40,000 spectators are expected to attend the mountain biking events and contractors had hoped to complete the Olympic improvement works at the junction in Basildon, Essex, in time. But councillors have decided to abandon the work to avoid huge tailbacks during the competitions. The junction links two key routes of London - the A13 and the A127. A spokesman for Essex County Council said: 'Following the Olympics, contractors will need to return in September to carry out final works. Mr Myers dismissed as 'complete rubbish' claims London athletes would be delayed and potentially miss events without the dedicated lanes. He said officials' 'modelling was all wrong'. He said he hoped up to 1,000 cabbies would take part in a demonstration in the square this evening, which could affect rush-hour traffic. Transport for London said the taxi protest was 'completely irresponsible'. John Mason, the transport body's director of taxi and private hire, said: 'We have worked tirelessly with groups that represent the majority of hard working taxi drivers to provide cabbies with as much access to the lanes as possible. 'Through dialogue which started in 2009, TfL has secured concessions specifically for taxi drivers, including the use of turns along the Olympic route network that were initially banned for all traffic except buses, as well as access to a number of kerbside Games lanes to pick up passengers. 'We have informed taxi drivers that any such demonstration is completely irresponsible and would only disrupt the travelling public - the very people taxi drivers are supposed to serve. 'We strongly urge taxi drivers to ignore calls to join these unnecessary protests and instead show why they are regularly voted the best in the world.' A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said officers were aware of the protest and put in place 'an appropriate policing plan'.

Defiant: A driver (left) holds his arm aloft to show his opposition to the Olympics lane while a fellow protester (right) gets out to read a newspaper as the roads remain gridlocked .

Not moving: A taxi driver leans out of his window as he sits in a queue during the protest . Concerns: An official from the United Cabbies Group union approaches members taking action against the traffic restrictions . The protest happened only a day after the opening of the first Games lane - between junctions 3 and 2 on the M4. Its introduction caused confusion for commuters travelling on approach roads into London. Drivers faced long tailbacks as many struggled to understand if they could use the freshly painted lanes or not. A YouGov poll has found that, with . the opening ceremony only 10 days away, more than half of Londoners have . made no alternative travel plans for the Games. The . research, commissioned by used car website Motors.co.uk, suggested that . many commuters had paid little attention to publicity campaigns.

A male hairdresser has been reunited with his long lost father after he recognised him on TV talking about  his embarrassing man boobs. Haydn Wells, 20, volunteered for Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies programme after he developed large breasts when he lost seven stone in weight. Incredibly, his biological father Adrian Van Sertima was watching the show and recognised the family resemblance immediately.

Mr Van Sertima, . 50, split up from Mr Wells's mother when she was pregnant with him and . has spent the last two decades trying to track him down. After contacting his son on Facebook the pair confirmed they were father and son. Mr . Wells, a hairdresser from Newark, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I never . thought that my embarrassing man boobs would bring me to my father I had . never met - it’s just been incredible.' Mr Van Sertima . was watching ‘Embarrassing Bodies’ on July 3 at his home in Colchester, . Essex, which featured Mr Wells who was about to undergo plastic surgery . to remove his man boobs, known as ‘moobs’. He suffered from gynaecomastia - . abnormal development of large mammary glands in males resulting in . breast enlargement - which he developed after shedding seven stone in . weight last year. He had an operation to remove the excess tissue earlier this year and the surgery was filmed for the TV show. Mr Van Sertima recognised the man on screen as having an uncanny resemblance to his other son. Haydn Wells pictured on the television show Embarrassing Bodies where . his father spotted him and realised that he looked very much like his . other son . After the show Mr Van Sertima looked up Haydn on Facebook and sent him a message saying: 'I think I might know your mother.' Haydn replied: 'I think you might be my biological dad.' The . delighted pair started chatting over the social networking site to . catch up on the past two decades - and are now planning to meet next . week. Mr Wells said: 'I have a whole new part of my life - everything’s changed since I had the operation. 'My dad said that I look a lot like his other son, so he put two and two together. I had always been an only child and now I’ve got a half-brother. 'All he knew was my name and that I lived in Nottinghamshire. He said that I look a lot like his other son, so he put two and two together. 'It’s really strange to go from being an only child and never knowing my dad, to having all of these aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents that I never had before. 'He said that all his family have been going crazy and they’re really excited because they’ve got a whole new family member.' Mr Van Sertima met his son's mother while he was in the RAF in Essex in 1990 and they had a brief relationship. Operation: Haydn Wells, 20, developed these man boobs after shedding seven stone in weight last year and had plastic surgery to remove them . They stayed together for a few months before breaking up shortly after she fell pregnant with their son. Mr Wells was born in 1992 but Mr Van Sertima never met his son. Mr Van Sertima said: 'When me and his mother split up, she rang me saying she was pregnant but I didn’t believe her. 'She said that she’d get on with her own life and I carried on with mine. 'One day I rang her and asked if he’d been born, she said he had and he was called Haydn. I never got the chance to see him. 'Then, while watching TV, when I saw the way one of the people on the show walked and smiled on screen, I saw how much he was like my son Nicholas. 'I thought ‘crikey’, he looks like my son. More and more when I saw the way he walked and smiled, I saw how much he was like my other son. 'Every time I had tried to find him before it was just a dead end. 'But after I saw the spelling of his name on the show I found him on Facebook and sent him a message. 'I said, ‘I think I might know your mum, but I’m not sure. Ask her if she knew someone in the air force called Vanse?’ - as that was my nickname when I was in the RAF. 'He replied that she did and that I must be his dad. It’s a miracle that I have found him now.' Father and son are planning to meet for the first time next week.","Haydn Wells volunteered for Embarrassing Bodies after he developed large breasts when he lost seven stone .

A dwarf actor who played an Ewok in Star Wars and a goblin in Harry Potter escaped jail again yesterday for flashing. Nicholas Read, 41, was drunk when he exposed himself to two medical students on a train and took a picture of one of them on his mobile phone. The 4ft 5in actor had just enrolled on a sex offenders’ treatment  programme after being convicted of a similar offence, and the new crime meant he was in breach of a suspended jail term. Guilty: Nicholas Read, 41, pictured left at Manchester Crown Court today, flashed his penis at two medical students on a train to Manchester  He played an Ewok in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi, right . He also had convictions for a string of other sex offences including making an obscene phone call and groping a woman. But he was given a 16-week prison . sentence suspended for three years after a judge said he was making . progress – and that the latest offence had helped him in ‘seeking to . conquer this sexual deviancy’. Manchester Crown Court heard that . Read had been working in York and drinking on a train back to Manchester . in January when two female medical students in their mid-20s got on. Conviction: Mr Reade, who is 4ft 5ins, is pictured at an earlier court appearance. He was also convicted in July last year of exposing himself to a schoolgirl . Nicola Carroll, prosecuting, said: ‘He took a seat next to the window and two women got on. ‘They were 25 years old and one sat . next to him and the other sat opposite her. He took some pictures of the . other girl on his mobile phone.’ She said Read exposed himself to the . women and they immediately contacted the guard. Read was arrested on . arrival at Manchester Piccadilly station. ‘He admitted that he had a . problem and said “I have gone and ruined my life, why have I done it?”’, . Miss Carroll added. ‘He admits that he traumatised and terrified the . students.’ Earlier the court heard that in . October 2010 Read sat next to a schoolgirl on a London to Leicester . train and performed a sex act on himself under a juggler’s hat for half . an hour. He was given a 20-week suspended sentence. Yesterday Judge Robert Thomas QC . said: ‘If somebody breaches a suspended sentence it means immediate . imprisonment and in the vast majority of cases it is. It is not going to . happen in your case. You have been taking a community sex offender work . group and have been making real progress. ‘Curiously this further offence seems in a way to have helped in you seeking to conquer this sexual deviancy you have. ‘You have been very frank and . straightforward and in the past often denied what you have done. You are . now finally facing up to the difficulties you face. I’m not going to . disrupt that progress by sending you to prison for only a matter of . weeks. It would be better to see if the progress you are making can be . contained.’ But he added: ‘The courts will have . to send you to prison if you commit another offence. That is inevitable . and nothing can save you.’ Read, of Cheadle, Staffordshire, had . pleaded guilty to indecent exposure. Earlier the court heard how Read’s . height earned him ‘blockbuster’ roles as an Ewok in Star Wars: Episode . VI – Return Of . The Jedi and a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.  He . was convicted of making an obscene call at a hotel in 1995, and in 2004 . he indecently assaulted a woman and was given a conditional discharge. In mitigation Rachel Faux, defending, . said: ‘He does not seek or expect any sympathy from  the court because . of the nature of his medical condition dwarfism. Nor does he seek to . excuse what he has done.’ Read will be supervised by the probation service and continue with the sex offender programme. Big screen roles: Read played a goblin in the film Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, starring Daniel Radcliffe.

Emyr Davies, pictured, advertised filthy rooms as 'newly-refurbished' but claimed he didn't understand what the phrase meant . Peeling wallpaper, mouldy bathrooms and tatty floors don’t sound the most inviting attributes for a seaside hotel. So owner Emyr Davies advertised his Four Seasons establishment as being ‘newly refurbished’ instead. He flaunted a few fake star ratings and tourist board accreditations for good measure. But his somewhat imaginative approach to marketing landed him in court after a flood of complaints from visitors about the three hotels he owns in Aberystwyth, West Wales. Last week Davies was ordered to pay almost £12,000 in fines, costs and compensation after admitting  12 charges of unfair trading under consumer protection legislation. Aberystwyth magistrates heard some guests who had booked the Four Seasons found themselves shunted off to other accommodation because Davies had double- booked their rooms. They ended up in his wife’s bedroom, still filled with her personal belongings, or in lower-graded rooms in other hotels. Those who got to stay at the Four Seasons itself, however, were even unhappier. In a litany of complaints on travel websites, they told of filthy rooms, grubby vinyl flooring and mouldy walls. Davies, 40, claimed that he didn’t understand what ‘newly refurbished’ meant because his first  language is Welsh. Run down: The bathroom in the Queensbridge was shabby and the court heard how one guest found her 'newly refurbished' room at the Four Seasons to be 'filthy' (pictured right) Another guest at the Queensbridge Hotel, also owned by Davies, said their room was covered in mould, whilst another one dubbed the hotel a 'dated hovel' and an 'overpriced dive' Maggie Hughes, prosecuting for . Ceredigion council, said tourism body Visit Wales had revoked the star . ratings for Davies’s hotels after a series of complaints, but he refused . to remove them from signs outside or on his website. He also boasted accreditation from the AA, which has not recognised the hotels for some time. At the Four Seasons signs indicated it . held a two-star AA rating, as well as three stars from the Welsh . Tourist Board. Rooms cost about £90. Davies, who also owns Belgrave . House and the Queensbridge hotels, was told by magistrates that he had . degraded the local tourist industry and badly let down his guests. They fined him £8,400 and ordered him . to pay £3,000 in costs to Ceredigion council. He will also have to pay . £550 compensation to guests who were misled about bookings.  Councillor . Dafydd Edward said the council had prosecuted as a last resort after . Davies ignored warnings. Simon Margrave-Jones, Davies’s . solicitor, told the Mail his client had made significant improvements to . the hotels over the past 24 months.  He added: ‘Mr Davies regrets any . distress or inconvenience caused to his guests.’ Of the 60 entries on the TripAdvisor website, 26 rated Davies’ Four Seasons hotel as 'terrible'.1. 'Fawlty Towers' - Four Seasons . Some guests claimed that a staff member at the Four Seasons hotel was a 'real-life Basil Fawlty', pictured . 'Breakfast waiter needs a kick up the backside.

Jailed: Lawrence Wood, pictured, repeatedly stabbed a 12-year-old girl innocently playing out in the street because he decided he wanted to kill someone . A man repeatedly stabbed a 12-year-old girl innocently playing out in the street because he decided he wanted to kill someone, a court heard today. Lawrence Wood, 31, later told police he had been surprised how easily the knife blade went into the youngster's back, describing it 'like slicing butter'. The girl was playing in the street in Wigan, Greater Manchester, with her three-year-old brother when the horrific attack took place. Liverpool Crown Court heard that stabbing the girl made Wood 'feel good' and so he did it again at a different part of her back. Mark Ainsworth, prosecuting, told the court that following the attack, he walked off and 'thought about killing someone else and knocking on a nearby door to do so.' But instead he waited in a nearby field for a few hours and then walked into Wigan police station with the knife and handed himself in. 'He went on to say he hoped that the girl had died. He wanted her father to be upset and he wanted people to know that he could not be messed with,' said Mr Ainsworth. Wood, 31, explained he had money difficulties and wanted to go to prison. 'He said he could not cope any more and wanted an end to it.' Liverpool Crown Court heard that Wood also said he 'felt nothing' about what he had done. He had said: 'I couldn’t care less about her.' When Wood first appeared in court in May he replied, ‘turnips’ when the charge of attempted murder was put to him and the judge formally entered a not guilty plea. However, today when his trial was due to start, Wood, of Marsh Green, Wigan, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Judge John Roberts ruled that Wood, who has no previous convictions and has refused to be examined by a psychiatrist, poses a serious danger to the public. He said that a sentence of life imprisonment had to be imposed 'to reflect the public abhorrence of such grotesque crime involving a defenceless 12-year-old girl in the presence of her three-year-old brother.' Judge Roberts told Wood, who showed no emotion, that he must serve 15 years before he can apply for parole but warned him that he may never be released. Guilty: Following the attack, Wood waited in a nearby field for a few hours and then walked into Wigan police station, pictured, with the knife and handed himself in . The court heard that although the girl has recovered physically she has been left permanently scarred and she and her family have been badly psychologically affected. Her mother stated that the family has 'undergone a complete change of life.' The victim’s personality has changed and she is withdrawn, her young brother has become aggressive and often makes stabbing actions and they are both awaiting counselling. Mr Ainsworth had told the court that the incident happened about 4.10 pm on February 8 this year as the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was playing on her scooter outside her home. 'Wood grabbed her by her arm or shoulder. He did not say anything but she felt a pain and then she felt wetness to her back. He let go of her and as he started to walk off she saw he was holding a knife. It was seven and a half inches long including a blade of three and a half inches. 'She was seriously injured but nevertheless managed to run back to her house and banged on the door and when it was opened she said, “I’ve been stabbed.”' No remorse: Liverpool Crown Court, pictured, heard that Wood also said he 'felt nothing' about what he had done . She was taken by ambulance to Wigan Royal Infirmary where it was found she had two stab wounds to the left side of her back. The higher one below her shoulder blade had punctured her lung and she needed a chest drain as it had collapsed. The lower wound was in her kidney area and she had to undergo surgery. Her coat showed three stab marks consistent with a further unsuccessful attempt to stab her. Mr Ainsworth said that Wood told police that the had no grudge against the victim though he did not like her older brother for bullying another boy and had fallen out with her father over drugs. His father had refused to lend him £10 which 'made him angry so he decided to go out and kill someone. He said he had always wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone.' His QC John McDermott told Liverpool Crown Court that Wood had repeatedly refused to have a psychiatric report prepared or any sort of evaluation. He said that there was no point asking for an adjournment for reports. 'He simply would not co-operate.' He added that he had warned Wood about the likely sentence he would receive but he was adamant. 'It is an unusual but egregious case.'","Lawrence Wood repeatedly stabbed the youngster and told police 'that it made him feel good'

However, customers who handed money over to the owner of a travel company were left out of pocket when their trips to the Holy Land were cancelled. Instead John Baird, the owner and operator of a religious tour operator, used their money to pay for groceries, baseball tickets, his mortgage and legal fees, federal agents said. Baird was the owner and operator of a travel company which offered trips to holy sites in the Middle East, such as Bethlehem (pictured) in Israel . The 74-year-old, of Elkins Park in Philadelphia, was jailed for five years after he pocketed more than $400,000 from 138 customers - many of them elderly and with limited means - for trips that never happened. He was also ordered to pay his victims $410,000 in compensation, it was reported. Baird was the owner and operator of travel company Christian Pilgrim Tours Inc, which offered trips to holy sites in the Middle East and other place, according to Philly.com. Between April 2006 and 2007 he took more than $400,000 from 138 customers for seven trips which were subsequently cancelled. With a few exceptions, Baird failed to deliver refunds promised to victims. After pleading guilty in January this year to fraud, Baird was given a five-year prison sentence. According to Philly.com, Baird was described as profiting from the dreams of his victims and delivered 'heartache and disappointment'. In the dock: Baird (not pictured) was jailed for five years for the fraud . U.S. district judge Michael Baylson said as he sentenced him: 'You preyed on people who were poor, of modest means, who were vulnerable and elderly, and you lied to them.' Baird's trips were advertised in Catholic magazines and priests or other church leaders were sometimes enlisted to encourage congregation members to book with his company. Customers paid Baird directly by sending him cheques for, almost always, the full cost of the trip far in advance of the departure date, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Diviny. Prosecutor Diviny said that some of the victims had even introduced friends to Baird's company - something which they felt guilty about. Baird's company filed for bankruptcy in October 2006 - one day before the departure date for a planned trip to Poland he was offering. In his defence, Baird blamed his actions on bad advice from his lawyers. He claimed in court that his attorneys told him he should focus on caring for his sick wife while they would look after his travel business. According to Philly.com, he said his lawyers later advised him to take the business into bankruptcy, adding: 'I had ineffective counsel. If they had done their job, I wouldn't be here today.'","John Baird was jailed for five years after pocketing money from 138 customers .

TV pundits and political analysts love making lists, ranking those in Capitol Hill on their skills, achievements, and, of course, shortcomings. But one annual list takes a look at Washington’s workers in a more superficial way. Enter The Hill’s annual ranking of the most winsome, attractive, and handsome – the Top 50 Most Beautiful People list, which is topped off by a former TGI Friday’s Worker-turned model-turned House Administration Committee staffer and a special assistant to a Republican representative. Most beautiful: Carolyn Amirpashaie, pictured, ranked second in The Hill's 50 Most Beautiful People list; the Republican is an assistant to Rep Randy Forbes (R-Virginia) Number one: Max Engling used to work at TGI Fridays, became a model, and ended up working in Washington . First on the list is 25-year-old Chicago-born Max Engling, who once slung burgers and fries for TGI Fridays. According to the Hill, Mr Engling was discovered while waiting tables for the casual dining chain. Double trouble: Julian Malasi, 28, is an identical twin . He worked as a model until 2011, when he realised his true passion lied in politics. He now works as a staff assistant for the House Administration Committee. But his days in the service industry aren’t over – after his day job, he heads to a local steak house to wait tables with his wife, Kelcey. Second on the list is Carolyn Amirpashaie, a Republican originally from Woodbridge, Virginia. The engaged assistant to Rep. Randy Forbes (R-Virginia) told The Hill that she is often mistaken for a sibling of the Kardashian clan. Her response is slightly mixed. ‘I’m just like, “Thanks?” I guess it’s the Middle Eastern thing,’ she told the website. Her father is Iranian and her mother hails from Pennsylvania. Others in the top ten include Kristen Callaway, 24, who works for Rep Steve Southerland (R-Florida), and Warren Wright, 34, a military fellow in the office of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Mr Wright was stationed in Kodiak, Alaska for two years as a Coast Guard helicopter pilot, and was shocked that he landed an interview with Sen.

Then there is Leslie Rath, a 22-year-old Republican who hails from Winterhaven, Florida. At work, she plans the schedule for Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Arizona), but at play, she enjoys taking her thoroughbred-cross Blondie on fox hunts. ‘We don’t actually kill the fox,’ she explained to The Hill. ‘The whole thing is the chase.’ The light-hearted list caused a stir this year, particularly because of former Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann ranked as the tenth hottest person in Washington. The Hill discusses the glossy electoral make-over the Minnesota representative underwent for her failed 2012 campaign, noting that women across America took inspiration from her coiffed, shoulder-length blow-out and asked for it at salons. The also wrote that Mrs Bachmann ‘made noise – literally – wearing a French manicure that clicked and clacked on the podiums of the GOP primary’s many debates.’ The Washington Post’s Reliable Source blog blithely deemed the rankings as ‘superficial and possibly sexist assessments of male and female public servants dedicated to the future of this country.’ The Hill’s editor-in-chief Hugo Gordon told Reliable Source: ‘She is a pretty woman.’ But Mr Gordon said that it all changed when she entered the presidential race. ‘She turned to stylists and enhanced the way she looked. She looked great on the trail.’ In good humour, VanityFair.com compiled a tongue-in-cheek look at the list, citing the 50 most beautiful sentences in The Hill's list.","Washington publication The Hill releases 50 Most Beautiful People list each year, listing their professions, age, and relationship status .

A teenage girl with cancer is being denied life-saving chemotherapy - because she is nine weeks pregnant and the aggressive treatment could kill her unborn child. A ban on abortion in the Dominican Republic means the girl - who has acute leukaemia - is being prevented from having the treatment because hospital officials say a round of chemotherapy would result in terminating the pregnancy. Aggressive treatment is needed to save the life of the unnamed 16-year-old, who is being treated at the Semma Hospital in the capital city of Santos Domingo. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Plea: The girl's mother Rosa Hernandez (pictured) is appealing to both doctors and the Dominican authorities to make an exception to save her daughter's life . Row: The girl is currently being treated at Semma Hospital (pictured) in the capital city of Santos Domingo for acute leukaemia . However, it is unclear whether the girl's treatment is being withheld because of the law or the doctors' misunderstanding of it. Confusion over whether chemotherapy could be classed as a termination is thought to be at the root of the delay. The girl's mother is now appealing to both doctors and the Dominican authorities to make an exception to save her daughter's life, it was reported. Rosa Hernandez told CNN: 'My daughter's life is first. I know that [abortion] is a sin and . that it goes against the law ... but my daughter's health is first.' The case has sparked controversy and has been fiercely debated by government officials and human right groups. Authorities are currently deciding whether she should be allowed to receive the chemotherapy. Staff at the hospital are said to be cautious about administering the treatment over fears they could be prosecuted . The case has angered human rights campaigners who say the treatment should have been given to the girl immediately . However women's rights activist Lilliam Fondeur said the delay was 'unacceptable' and that the treatment should have been offered immediately. She told CNN: 'How can it be possible . that so much time is being wasted? That the treatment hasn't begun yet . because they're still meeting, trying to decide if she has the right to . receive the treatment to save her life - that's unacceptable.' The director of the bioethics council, which rules on the application of the law, claimed the council was leaning toward allowing her to have the chemotherapy. However, other politicians claimed the debate was 'artificial' because they doctors were unsure about the application of the law. Pelegrin Castillo, one of those who engineered the section of law behind the abortion ban, said the ban did not prohibit treating the patient with chemotherapy. However, it does make it illegal for doctors to carry out a termination in order to administer the treatment. In spite of this doctors are reluctant to treat the girl for fear of prosecution. In the meantime - amid confusion over the application of the law - a young girl's life hangs in the balance while she waits for a decision to be made. The case has highlighted a section of the Dominican constitution that prohibits taking the life of another. Article 37 of the law, which was . passed in 2009, states that 'the right to life is inviolable from the . moment of conception and until death'. As a result, this has been interpreted by Dominican courts as a strict mandate against abortion. Under the same section of law, . Article 37 also prohibits the death penalty, which has also been . abolished in the Dominican Republic. The issue has sparked debate over the Caribbean country's abortion laws with many saying they need to be scrapped. Legalising abortion would also eradicate the risk posed to other women seeking out secret and illegal procedures for unwanted pregnancies.

A dentist who funded a lavish globe-trotting lifestyle by conning the NHS out of £1.4million was behind bars last night. In one of the most complex frauds of its kind, Joyce Trail filed more than 7,000 invoices for work never done – including fitting false teeth on patients who were actually dead. She had not even met many of the patients she was invoicing about, having obtained their details by contacting care homes to advertise her services. Globe-trotter: Dr Joyce Trail, pictured in 2007 at the opening of her business in Handsworth, Birmingham, made thousands of false claims for treating patients . Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC said . Trail, 50, frittered away the cash on holidays to the Caribbean islands . of St Barts and Jamaica, as well as Miami, where she would go on . spending sprees for Cartier jewellery, Prada clothes and Jimmy Choo . shoes. When investigators searched her £1.25million six-bedroom gated . home, they discovered dozens of boxes of designer shoes stacked up. Trail was convicted of conspiracy to . defraud yesterday at the end of a five-week trial at Birmingham Crown . Court. Judge Peter Carr remanded the dentist in custody and warned her . she faces a ‘substantial’ jail term when she returns to court for . sentencing next month. The judge told her: ‘You abused your . position as a professional and you abused your position as a dentist. You have effectively stolen a large amount of money that was not . available to an already overstretched health service.’ Miss Moore said investigators ‘smelt a . rat’ after trawling through files at her surgery in Handsworth, . Birmingham. As part of a random check, officials from the NHS Business . Services Authority contacted one of Trail’s supposed patients at his . care home – and discovered he was a private patient who had not used an . NHS dentist. High-life: A court heard Dr Trail spent some of the money on expensive . Jimmy Choo shoes that normally sell for more than £400 a pair . Fake invoices: Dentist Joyce Trail's practice in Handsworth, Birmingham, where investigators trawled through her files . Realising the fake invoice could be . the tip of the iceberg, they widened the investigation and Trail, from . Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was eventually arrested. Miss Moore told the jury 100 claims . were made for treating patients who were dead, adding: ‘Dr Trail treated . people who lived in nursing homes and residential care a great deal of . the time. ‘She double and triple-claimed for . people that she had actually treated and then she used patient details . which had been quite unwittingly supplied to her by nursing homes to . claim for people that she had never even met. ‘It meant the practice received in the . order of £1.4million that it should not have done. But, moreover, Dr . Trail then siphoned off money which enabled her to live a lavish . lifestyle. She was globe-trotting, spending time at very exotic . locations. Take off: The court heard Dr Trail lived a lavish lifestyle spending time at very exotic locations . ‘Her American Express bill was vast . compared to what she was legitimately making from the business, but of . course when it’s other people’s money it’s very easy to spend it.’ Miss Moore told the court: ‘Dr Trail . claimed and was paid a great deal for treatment she had not performed – . not just a few claims, not just a few clerical errors, but something in . the order of £1.4million of false claims.’ Trail’s daughter, Nyri Sterling, 33, . of Oldbury, West Midlands, was also convicted of conspiracy to defraud. She worked in the administration side of the practice and assisted Trail . in administering the fraud. Both women had denied the charges which . relate to the period of April 2006 to March 2009. A spokesman for NHS Birmingham and Solihull said Trail’s NHS contract had now been terminated.

Other bookmakers, including Sky Bet, also voided all bets, saying it was 'impossible to back the correct flame lighter'.

It even led to a war of words between former decathlete Thompson and rower Redgrave as they seemingly went head to head to light the cauldron, as they both questioned the other's credentials to be the one to light the . fire to launch London 2012. Redgrave did run into the stadium holding the Torch last night but he was greeted by seven young athletes, each nominated by himself and British Olympic heroes Lynn Davies, Duncan Goodhew, Dame Kelly Holmes, Dame Mary Peters, Shirley Robertson and Daley Thompson. It was the young athletes who each lit one of the copper petals which had been brought into the stadium with the teams and then rose to form the cauldron. Lighting up the games: Having lit the copper petals the cauldron came together in spectacular fashion . People gather around the Olympic Flame after the cauldron in the Olympic Stadium is lit . The decision has received some criticism across the globe however, as John Cherwa from the LA Times wrote: 'Hated the flame lighting. Just make a decision and pick someone.'

'I suppose the questions now will be 'Are you putting out the cauldron?' - I've not had that phone call yet.' He said that when he entered the stadium there was an 'absolutely amazing atmosphere'.

American judo champ Nicholas Delpopolo has been booted from the Olympic Games after testing positive for marijuana. Delpopolo, who had finished seventh in the 73kg judo event, accepted his expulsion on Monday. He said, however, that the positive test was caused by inadvertently eating food that he did not realise had been baked with the recreational drug. Scroll down for video . Kicked out: Nicholas Delpopolo, pictured fighting South Korea's Wang Ki-Chun on July 30, has been sent home from the Olympics after testing positive for marijuana . The 23-year-old judoka from Westfield, New Jersey, said his positive test was he consumed the cannabis before leaving for London. 'I apologise to U.S. Olympic Committee, to my teammates, and to my fans, and I am embarrassed by this mistake,' he said in a statement. He went on: 'I look forward to representing my country in the future, and will rededicate myself to being the best judo athlete that I can be.' Reefer rebuke: Delpopolo said the positive test stemmed from something he ate that had marijuana baked into it before he left for London . Weed woes: Delpopolo, pictured fighting against Mongolia's Nyam-Ochir Sainjargal, left, and against China's Chi Yip Cheung, right, finished seventh in the 73kg judo event . He waived the right for his case to be heard before the Disciplinary Commission. U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman . Patrick Sandusky said in a statement that his group is 'absolutely . committed to clean competition and stringent anti-doping penalties. Cannabis's place on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) prohibited list has sparked much debate. President John Fahey indicated earlier this year that WADA may look at changing the criteria for cannabis as a banned substance. At the moment, a substance appears on the banned list if it meets the following criteria: it is proven to be performance enhancing, it goes against the spirit of sport, or it is dangerous to the health of athletes. Marijuana, or cannabis, is forbidden under current rules, with athletes facing a two-year ban if it is found in their system. While it is generally accepted that cannabis is unlikely to give athletes an advantage in fast-paced sports, some experts say it could prove helpful in sports like shooting or golf where a steady hand is needed. Any . positive test, for any banned substance, comes with the appropriate . consequences and we absolutely support the disqualification.' Delpopolo, according to his official Olympic biography, was born Petra Perovic in the former Yugoslavia. He was adopted by an American family who changed his name. According to Britain’s National Health Service, the amount of time that marijuana remains in the body depends on how often the person smokes it. If the subject has only smoked marijuana once or twice, it will be gone form the body within several days. But for heavier smokers, it takes an average of two weeks to one month for it to leave their system, although it can be longer. Long-term users may still have weed in their body two to three months after they last smoked it. Delpopolo brings the number of athletes suspended by the IOC to five since the start of the Olympic period on July 16. I'll be back: Delpopolo said he would rededicate himself to being the best judo athlete that he can be . He joins Colombian 400 meters runner Diego Palomeque Echevarria and Russian cyclist Victoria Baranova who both tested positive for testosterone. Belarussian hammer thrower Ivan Tsikhan and Moroccan runner Amine Laalou were also ruled out with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) saying they had been charged with anti-doping rule violations.

Sheena Morris, 22, was found hanging in a Florida hotel room on New Year's Day 2009, hours after she reportedly fought with her 48-year-old fiancé Joe Genoese. However Miss Morris's mother Kelly Osborn has continually criticized the police work and hired her own team of private investigators, claiming that her daughter's death was staged. Mystery: Sheena Morris, 22, was originally believed to have committed suicide in a Florida hotel room at New year in 2009 but the case is being reviewed . Rocky relationship: Sheena, 22, and her 48-year-old boyfriend Joe Genoese had allegedly had a domestic dispute in the hours before her death . Now a specialist cold case unit in Florida has announced that they would review the death of the New York-born woman. Ms Osborn and Sheena's father David Morris, have long believed that their daughter was killed and the hanging in the bathroom at Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island staged. She told Fox News: 'The shower was dusted. There were no fingerprints, not even hers.' Prior to Miss Morris's body being found, guests in the next room had dialed 911 around 1am on January 1 to . report a domestic disturbance from the couple's hotel room. Mr Genoese then reportedly left the hotel and returned to his apartment in Tampa, an hour's drive away. According . to the account on the family's website, Justice4sheena.com, Miss Morris called the police department . close to her home in Hillsborough County at 2am because she wanted officers to check it over. In a taped recording, a young woman's voice can be heard saying that he was 'going to ruin her apartment because she ruined his life'. Tragedy: Sheena Morris's parents have never believed that their daughter committed suicide and have campaigned relentlessly for the investigation into her death to be reopened . Devoted to her pets: Miss Morris was found hanged in a hotel room on Anna Maria Island in Florida following New Year's Eve . Some 13 hours later, hotel staff heard Miss Morris's dogs barking in her hotel room and called police. Her body was discovered in the bathroom. Her fiancé Joe Genoese was not named as a person of interest in Miss Morris's death as the tenant of his Tampa apartment, Marcos Claudio had seen him that night. However in April this year, Mr Claudio said he could not be sure of the exact time he saw Mr Genoese as he had been drinking on New Year's Eve, according to the Herald-Tribune. A team of 15 forensic experts, who . were not involved with the original case, will now work with the local . Bradenton Police Department to go over evidence and review witness . accounts from the tragic death in 2009. Chief of police Sam Speciale said they . would work with the task force but said crime scene evidence still . pointed to a suicide and he stood by that verdict. Investigation: The parents of Miss Morris have accused police of botching the investigation into her death at the Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island . Sadly missed: Sheena Morris was found dead in a hotel on Anna Maria Island, Florida when she was 22 years old . However he added: 'If (the team) looks at it and finds . something that we didn’t see, or that the other agencies didn't see, . that's great. That's why we're here.' The chief medical examiner for the Florida district changed the 26-year-old's cause of death from suicide to undetermined, as the theory that her death may have been staged destabilized his original verdict. The cold case team, which was not reopening but 'reviewing' the suicide according to police, will make its findings in around two months. Search for answers: Kelly Osborn, left, has relentlessly gone over the case of her daughter's death for three years .

The gunman alleged to have slaughtered 12 people during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises worked as a counselor at a summer camp for underprivileged children, it emerged today. James Holmes was described as 'shy and reserved' by a fellow counselor at Camp Max Straus near Glendale, California, where he spent a summer while studying at the University of California, Riverside in 2008. Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles, the organisation which runs the camp, has confirmed that Holmes, then aged 20, was in charge of 10 children aged between seven and 14. Camp counselor: James Holmes, right, pictured with another worker at Camp Max Straus in summer 2008 . The group said in a statement: 'His role was to insure that these children had a wonderful camp . experience by helping them learn confidence, self esteem and how to work . in small teams to effect positive outcomes.' They added that the activities Holmes and the other counselors were involved with included swimming, horseback riding and other sports. A spokesman for the organisation said that Holmes, who leapt to national notoriety after allegedly launching an attack on a movie theatre which injured 58 in Aurora, Colorado, had had no disciplinary problems while at Camp Max Straus. 'It is with shock and sorrow that we learned of the incident in Aurora,' the spokesman said. 'Our hearts and prayers go out to all the families and . friends of those involved in this horrible tragedy.' Although pictures of Holmes from the camp appear to show him fitting in with the other counselors, one of those who worked with him said that always seemed very separate from the group. 'The entire staff was really close, considering we lived together - except . for James,' the counselor told NBC News. 'He . really kept to himself and hardly ever went on any trips with the rest . of the staff. He was very shy and reserved.' She added: 'It is sickening knowing that he killed kids the same age that he once cared for.' Group: But Holmes, pictured seventh from the left, was described as 'shy and reserved' by a fellow counselor . The new details about Holmes's past add to the picture of the 24-year-old PhD student who was described as 'really smart' but was in the process of dropping out of graduate school at the University of Colorado Denver. He is said to have had few friends and barely any social life, instead spending hours indoors playing the video game Guitar Hero. Police are still baffled as to Holmes's motives for launching the deadly attack, but . one clue may come in a report that the killer, whose family comes from . San Diego, had dyed his hair red and described himself as 'the Joker', . implying that he was inspired by the popular Batman series itself. Although Holmes described himself as . 'easy-going', neighbours and classmates recalled an anti-social recluse . who had little contact with others. Killer: 24-year-old James Holmes is a PhD dropout who apparently compared himself to the Joker . 'Easy-going': Those who knew Holmes, pictured left in a yearbook, said he did not seem like a potential killer . Officials do not currently believe that the gunman had terror links, adding to the mystery of his possible motives. 'It clearly looks like a deranged individual,' NYPD police chief Ray Kelly said. 'He had his hair painted red. He said he was ""The Joker"", obviously the enemy of Batman.' A neighbour also reported that . police, who were searching Holmes's apartment for explosives, asked him . if he had seen 'a white guy with crazy hair, possibly dyed unnatural . colors', the Denver Post said. But . neighbours at university housing in Denver described Holmes as a . recluse who kept himself to himself. One student said: 'No one knew him. No one.' Investigation: Police are looking into this adult website profile to find out if it is belongs to Holmes . Trail of blood: A line of blood leads from the emergency exit of the cinema, from where James Holmes launched his killing spree, and past the suspect's car . Holmes - who had been working towards his PhD for a year before dropping out - had one techno song blaring from his stereo in the hours before the massacre and left the music on repeat in his booby-trapped apartment as he departed to commit the massacre. He was also reportedly addicted to video game Guitar Hero. His shocked mother in San Diego confirmed that he was behind the massacre, telling reporters: 'You've got the right man.' After graduating from Westview High . School in 2006, Holmes studied neuroscience at the University of . California Riverside, where he graduated with honours. Neighbours in California said that Holmes moved to Colorado to attend graduate school after failing to find a job. The university said he was dropping out because of academic issues, and had not had any disciplinary problems. Family: Holmes's grandmother, pictured, was seen entering and exiting the family home in San Diego . Home: The house in San Diego where Holmes grew up before headed to college at UC Riverside . The gunman described himself as 'quiet and easy-going' in a rental application last year, and high school classmates confirmed that impression in interviews with the Los Angeles Times. Dan Kim, currently a student at UC San Diego, said: 'He didn't seem like a troublemaker at all. He just seemed like he wanted to get in and out, and go to college.' Holmes ran in Westview's cross country team with Tori Burton, who said: 'He was very quiet. He was a nice guy when you did occasionally talk to him. But he was definitely more introverted.' Another classmate, Keith Goodwin, . spoke of his shock at seeing the 'generally pleasant' young man hit the . news for his role in the massacre. 'James was certainly not someone I would have ever imagined shooting somebody,' Mr Goodwin said. Holmes has only ever had contact with police over a traffic violation, according to the New York Times, who spoke to two law-enforcement officials about the gunman. 'He’s . not on anybody’s radar screen,' said one official, while the other . added: 'This guy is somewhat of an enigma. Nobody knows anything about . him.' Dark Knight: Holmes was apparently dressed as the Joker, bottom, when he attacked the Batman screening . The killer's family appealed for privacy as they described their anguish at seeing Holmes involved in massacre. 'Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,' they said in a statement released by San Diego police. 'We ask that the media respect our privacy during this difficult time. 'Our family is cooperating with authorities in both San Diego, California and Aurora, Colorado. We are still trying to process this information and we appreciate that people will respect our privacy.' Jackie Mitchell, a furniture mover who lives several blocks from the suspect's apartment building in Colorado, said he had drinks with Holmes at a local bar on Tuesday night, though he gave no sign of being distressed or violent. After Holmes approached him 'we just talked about football. He had a backpack and geeky glasses and seemed like a real intelligent guy, and I figured he was one of the college students,' Mr Mitchell said. When Mr Mitchell saw Holmes's photo after the shooting, 'the hair stood up on my back,' he said. 'I know this guy.' Another neighbour, Rachel Reed, said she met Holmes in a local bar when she put rap music by Lil Wayne on the jukebox. He came over and 'made some racially charged comments about rap,' she said. 'He seemed like he was a normal dude. He was a little buzzed.' Holmes is not talking to police and has asked for a lawyer, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. His first court appearance is set for Monday morning at 9.30.","James Holmes was 'shy and reserved' at Camp Max Straus in California .

Almost half of the Coalition’s ministers are increasing the size of their empires by hiring more staff at a time of an unprecedented jobs squeeze across the rest of the public sector. Seven government departments, including the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, increased their headcount in the three months to March, despite the austerity drive in Whitehall. Figures compiled by the TaxPayers’ Alliance revealed wide variations, with Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey overseeing the largest recruitment drive and Conservative Defence Secretary Philip Hammond cutting the largest number of bureaucrats. Promises: Prime Minister David Cameron, who vowed to slim down the civil service, visited Northern Ireland's Giant's Causeway this morning . They cast doubt on the determination of some ministers to implement David Cameron’s promise to create a ‘leaner, swifter’ Civil Service. By 2015, the Coalition says it will have reduced the size of  the Whitehall machine by  23 per cent. Amid frustration at the top of the Government at the pace of reform in some areas, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude yesterday set out provocative plans to examine a further, far-reaching shake-up of the Whitehall machine. Independent experts will be commissioned to examine whether procedures adopted in other countries – such as forcing senior civil servants to offer their resignation when a new government is elected, or putting them on strict contracts meaning they can be dismissed if they do not reach targets set by ministers – should be copied here. According to the TaxPayers’ Alliance report, staff numbers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) rose by 4 per cent from 2,816 to 2,929 between last December and March this year. Up: Employees leave the Treasury in Whitehall, one of the departments that has increased its headcount . Though Chancellor George Osborne is leading the drive to rein in the public sector, the Treasury was among the departments to increase its workforce over the first quarter of this  year, with numbers rising by  2 per cent to 1,297. The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for increasing government efficiency and Civil Service reform, increased its headcount of staff by 3 per cent to 2,097. Other ministries to have increased the headcount of officials over the three-month period were the Foreign Office, the Department of Health, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the Department for International Development. At the MoD, by contrast, the total headcount of civil servants, excluding members of the Armed Forces, fell by 5 per cent between December and April from 57,210 to 54,250, according to the analysis of official figures. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘When the Government is supposed to be making vital reductions to the size of the public sector, it beggars belief that there are departments which have been increasing the number of Whitehall bureaucrats they employ. Row: Campaigners claim Ed Davey 'is letting down cabinet colleagues' by not controlling staff numbers in his department . ‘Ministers increasing staff numbers at departments like Energy and Climate Change and International Development are letting down their more responsible colleagues. ‘Every government department needs to work to cut the size of the Civil Service and ease the pressure on taxpayers and the frontline services on which people rely the most.’ A spokesman for DECC, which Gordon Brown created in 2008, suggested its staffing increase was explained by it being ‘a relatively new department’. ‘The department has a challenging and important agenda as set out in the spending review and posts that have been filled over the last months are necessary to enable us to meet those targets,’ he added. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The number of civil servants is down 7,000 over the quarter and 43,000 over the last 12 months. Overall, Civil Service employment stands at 428,000 – a new post-Second World War low, and down from around half a million in May 2010. ‘The small increase in the Cabinet Office was due to staff transferring across from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and, as these are not new civil servants, did not cost the taxpayer anything extra.’ Ministers have been frustrated that civil servants can avoid personal responsibility for policy failures by arguing that ministers, not officials, are accountable to Parliament for everything that happens in their department. A ministerial source said: ‘Every option is on the table. It would be very arrogant to assume that the way we govern is unimproveable. Francis Maude is very clear he wants to look at radical models.’","Seven Coalition departments have increased their workforce between Dec 2011 and early March 2012 .

"PUBLISHED: . 14:16 EST, 1 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:53 EST, 1 August 2012 . Three 'merciless' thugs battered a pensioner in his bed before stringing him up by his belt and fleeing with just £20, a court heard yesterday. Frail John Savage was asleep in his bed in Loppington, Shropshire, when he was dragged from his bed by the evil trio who shone a torch in his eye. Evil trio Daniel Jones, 21, Matthew Wood, 19, and Christopher Weaver, 18, tied the 77-year-old farmer up by his trouser belt as they rummaged through his pockets and ransacked his home in June last year. Faces of evil: Weaver, 18, Jones, 21, and Wood, 19, tied Mr Savage up before viciously beating him and fleeing his home with just £20 in change . Mr Savage was then frogmarched downstairs, where the gang viciously beat him and stamped on his head during an attack which a judge described as 'the stuff of nightmares'. The yobs then fled with just £20 in change before stealing Mr Savage’s Ford Ranger pickup truck, which they abandoned nearby. On Tuesday, the callous trio were jailed for a total of nearly 23 years at Shrewsbury Crown Court after admitting robbery and other offences. Jailing them, Judge Robin Onions, told the men: 'It’s the stuff of nightmares. 'Someone shining a torch in your eyes who is prepared to use force to steal your property. 'Offences like these are carried out by thugs and cowards.' Wood, from Wem, Shropshire, was jaield for eight years and three months, Weaver, also of Wem, received seven years and 10 month term and Jones, from Shrewsbury, was sentenced to six years and nine months. The court heard Mr Savage suffered bleeding to his brain and needed surgery on his left eye after the attack at his home in Loppington, Shrops., on June 21. Jailed: The three thugs were given a combined prison term of nearly 23 years at Shrewsbury Crown Court yesterday . Mr Savage, who spent a week recovering from the attack in hospital at the time, is still receiving eye and dental treatment for his horrific injuries a year on. After the case he said: 'It would have been better if they had four or five years hard labour and were fed on bread and water. 'They will have a time of luxury in prison and will have a hell of a better time than me if I were in a nursing home.' Chief Inspector Sarah Wagstaff, of West Mercia Police, said Mr Savage had shown remarkable 'courage and humility'. She said: 'This could easily have been a murder inquiry. 'Mr Savage has shown tremendous fortitude and spirit in the face of this vicious and horrifying ordeal. The three men responsible showed him no mercy. 'Despite his injuries, Mr Savage managed to stagger to a neighbour’s home to raise the alarm. 'He was badly hurt and someone of his age who was not so strong, might not have survived. 'As it is, Mr Savage has made light of his ordeal and his injuries. At times, he has seemed more concerned about the offenders, saying it is such a waste of three young lives. 'You have to admire his steadfastness considering the extent of the violence used against him.'","Frail John Savage, 77, hung by his trouser belt and viciously beaten by gang .

'After having come through the home . invasion and the death of his entire family ... this marriage was a time . for new beginnings.' Rev. Hawke, who said he has known Paluf for a year, went on: 'My . wife and I hope that they have children, and that they would love those . children just as much as [Petit] loved his other children.' The wedding between Dr. Petit, 55, and photographer Paluf, 34, was witnessed by 300 friends and family on Sunday.

Police said the 'major players' in the drugs trade were caught following an eight-month covert operation by the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, Titan. Drug traffickers: (Left to right) Paul McDonald, 44, who was jailed for 15 years and gang leaders, John Cooke, 32, and James Swarez, 44, . who were both locked up for 17 years at Liverpool Crown Court . During the investigation, police seized drugs with a wholesale value of £1 million - including 20.4lb (9.25kg) of heroin, 18.2lb (8.25kg) of cocaine, 26.5lb (12kg) of amphetamine and 11,370 class C benzylpiperazine (BZP) tablets. Gang leaders John Cooke, 32, of Walmer Road, Birkdale, Merseyside, and James Swarez, 44, of Queens Road, Crosby, Merseyside, were both jailed for 17 years at Liverpool Crown Court after earlier pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply controlled drugs.

During the investigation, police seized drugs with a wholesale value of £1 million - including 20.4lb (9.25kg) of heroin, 18.2lb (8.25kg) of cocaine, 26.5lb (12kg) of amphetamine and 11,370 class C benzylpiperazine (BZP) tablets . The pair, who lived a luxury lifestyle thanks to their ill-gotten gains, obtained high purity drugs from trafficker Paul McDonald, 44, and used a network of couriers to target drug addicts in Glasgow, Cardiff, Preston and Ellesmere Port. McDonald, of Fernbank Road, Huyton, who also admitted conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, was jailed for 15 years. Ten other gang members, who were used as couriers, received jail sentences of between five and 12 years.
