"They have some of the most provocative names around and, at first glance, may seem less than appetising when reaching for a snack or drink. But what seems like terrible brands to us could just actually be the true meanings of words getting lost in translation. From Japan's Cream Collon biscuit rolls to Finland's Megapussi crips, FEMAIL reveals some of the most unfortunately named foods in the world. Japan's Cream Collon is a biscuit snack shaped like small tubes and filled with cream . Cream Collon Biscuit Roll . Biscuit snacks shaped like small tubes and filled with cream should not be labelled with such a laughable name. The Japanese product, which is manufactured by the country's biggest confectionery company Glico, is a favourite with students and children. Collon, which of course is sounds and looks like the name for the large intestine, was a deliberate choice of moniker for this particularly product. One can't help but wonder what the manufacturers were thinking when they came up with this gem. Breast Munchies are made from 100% chicken breast nuggets and are enjoyed by Australians . Breast Munchies . Produced by Australian brand Inghams, the chicken nuggets, or breast munchies to give them their rightful name, are a popular oven-cooked meal in Down Under. Made from 100 per cent chicken breast, the munchies are a good example of the Aussie sense of humour, which doesn't take anything too seriously. And we have to applaud them for that. Finland's Megapussi Juusto Snacks are similar in smell and taste to Wotsits . Megapussi Juusto Snacks . They look like Wotsits, they may smell like Wotsits and according to their fans, they even taste like Wotsits but they're definitely not known as Wotsits. Instead, this cheesy snack from Finland has been given a rather rude name, which will no doubt bring tears of laughter to all corn-based snack connoisseurs . Batmilk yogurt is a product of Brazilian company Batavo and is made from cow's milk . Batmilk yogurt . Brazilian dairy company Batavo's yogurt has one of the most unlikely names for a product of its nature. But rest assured that this treat is definitely not made from the milk of bats but instead comes from normal cows' milk. The company received such bad press after launching the product that they decided to change the name to something less offensive. Romanian hot drink Urinal is made with cranberries and is said to offer 'natural protection' Urinal hot drink . While in some places this is commonly used as a receptacle in male restrooms, for some people urinal is a hot drink. Romania's hot cranberry cordial drink is said to offer natural protection (due to natural antioxidants in cranberries) and 'contribute to fluid in the body. We cannot however confirm if it is a diuretic. China's Only Puke crackers are actually known as Only Pukeet . Only Puke crackers . With a name that makes you think of vomiting, this snack is not going to be the first choice for those looking for a savoury treat. The honey bean crackers are a product of China and are actually known as Only Pukeet. Unfortunately due to bad product design, the last two letters in the word are invisible, saddling this treat with a name that could make you lose your appetite. Japan's Crunky Ball Nude or Crunky Nude Ballis made with hazelnut paste and malt and covered in chocolate . Crunky Ball Nude . The second Japanese product appearance in the list, the provocative Crunky Ball Nude or Crunky Nude Ball is a confection made with hazelnut paste and malt, covered in crisped rice and chocolate. And while it may look like a downmarket version of a Ferrero Rocher, online reviews say that these nude balls are less tasty than the product that could have inspired from. At a Turkish party? Dip your crudites in tzatziki, muhammara or cemen . Fresh Cemen Dip . Surely no party is complete without some cemen dip? The spicy garlic spread is found on chiller cabinets in Turkish supermarkets and is a case of the true meaning of a word getting lost in translation. In Turkish cemen is actually the word for a dip made from tomato paste. Unfortunately it translates as something else in English. Slake your thirst with a Greek Vergina beer . Vergina beer . A pale lager produced in Macedonian Thrace Brewery in Komotini, Greece, Vergina Beer is said to have a light hoppy flavour with hints of malt. According to beer reviewer Michael Fajardo, the  only negative about this beer is that it also has a mild metallic flavour. Here are some more of our favourites: .

"She's long been a fan of all things equestrian but the Duchess of Cornwall tried her hand at a very different type of sport during a visit to Newcastle today. The Duchess of Cornwall was at the local branch of cancer charity Maggie's, which offers emotional and practical support to people with cancer, when she was given a t'ai chi demonstration. A martial art, t'ai chi is designed to improve mental wellbeing while also being useful as a means of self-defence. Scroll down for video . Martial arts: The Duchess of Cornwall arrives at Maggie's where she watched a t'ai chi demonstration . After watching the t'ai chi demonstration, Camilla, 67, who was glamorous in a cream suit, toured the centre chatting to patients. She was also introduced to architect Ted Cullinan, who told her that the centre was of particular importance to male cancer victims as 'northern men struggle to express their emotions'. Later, while unveiling a new piece of art for the building, she said: 'I feel I have been in on this project from the very beginning. 'It’s wonderful and so uplifting and such a happy place. It brings everyone together, families and children, and they can all come and get the experience. Thank you so much for having me today.' The Duchess also said she eventually hoped to see a Maggie’s centre in every major city across the country. Maggie's, of which the Duchess became president in March 2008, opened its first branch in 1996 and now has 18 centres. Last year the Newcastle centre, which is next to the Freeman Hospital, had more than 16,000 visits, of which 6,000 were men. Glamorous: The Duchess of Cornwall chose a chic cream suit and a polka dot shirt for the engagement . All smiles: She joined cancer sufferers for tea following the t'ai chi demonstration and unveiled new art . 'I’m honoured to have welcomed Her Royal Highness to Maggie’s Newcastle,' said Laura Lee, chief executive of Maggie’s afterwards. 'We’re incredibly grateful for her continued support and the difference it makes to those who visit and work in our centres.' After the visit to the cancer centre,  the Duchess travelled on to Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children’s Books. It is the only place in the UK dedicated to the art of children’s books and receives over 80,000 visitors a year. There Camilla met the staff and children who use the museum and was shown round the various spaces and exhibitions. The Duchess rounded off her visit to the North East by being shown round the Laing Art Gallery, where she was shown a number of previously unseen paintings, including one of herself. Trust me, I'm a (royal) doctor! Prince Charles tries his hand at 'surgery' during tour of London hospital . Tough job: Prince Charles tries his hand at keyhole 'surgery' during a visit to St Mary's Hospital . Training: He also met trainee surgeons working at the brand new Surgical Innovation Centre . Have you scrubbed up? He watched an operation on a plastic patient and chatted to medics . He's famous for his love of technology but Prince Charles found himself getting a bit closer to the action than he bargained for this morning. The royal, 66, was touring the brand new Surgical Innovation Centre at St. Mary's Hospital in London when he was invited to try his hand at 'surgery'. Using specialist 3D technology, the centre replicates the challenges surgeons face during operations, although Charles didn't quite have the light hands required. Instead, the first-in-line to the throne gamely waggled a few levers in a bid to move marbles around a bowl - a task designed to improve dexterity. State of the art: Charles was also shown some of the new technology being pressed into use . 3D: The centre also uses three dimensional technology to help train students . High tech: Charles also visited the Health Information Exchange where he was shown the latest gadgets . Afterwards, he was shown an impressively lifelike recreation of the human body, as well as getting a closer look at trainee surgeons practising their skills using a blow-up operating table. He was also shown the Da Vinci robot, an incredible piece of equipment which can perform advanced ear, nose and throat surgery. The newly opened centre specialises in general, weight-loss and breast surgery as well as gastroenterological and urology cases. It is connected to the Health Innovation Exchange studio which sees doctors and scientists work on innovative cures and other novel treatments. It was to this that the Prince of Wales went next, where he was shown  a smartphone app to help children with asthma, a design intervention to improve patient cancer care and a design-led solution to improve uptake in bowel cancer screening. Innovative: Cutting edge treatments on show included a smartphone app designed to help asthmatic children .

"Five successful plus-size models who lost their representation when their mainstream agency, Ford Models, closed down its 'Ford +' division in 2013, have formed their own coalition. The stunning New York-based models launched ALDA last year, describing themselves as 'a group of women aiming to represent beauty in all sizes' and have now appeared together in feminist culture magazine Bust's February issue. 'Some people are meant to be a size negative zero and some people are meant to be a size 16', says Danielle Redman, herself a U.S. size 12, who models a range of sportswear along with fellow ALDA members Ashley Graham, Marquita Pring, Inga Eiriksdottir and Julie Henderson.

Curves: Five plus-size models launched ALDA last year, describing themselves as 'a group of women aiming to represent beauty in all sizes' and have now appeared in a spread for Bust Magazine (pictured) All five ALDA models broke convention last January when they approached IMG Models in New York together and were later signed by the prestigious agency for its main board. IMG's managing director Ivan Bart announced that the agency was on a mission to 'defy the typical stereotypes that have existed in the modeling industry for the past few decades.' Ashley Graham, a 28-year-old Nebraska beauty with her own line of plus-size lingerie, told Bust: 'I've been called a plus-size model for 15 years. 'I don't have any shame with it, I don't really care... at the end of the day, I know who I am. I am Ashley Graham, and I am a model - I am not just a plus-size model.'

'I never really understood that gap between being a curvier model and a straight-size model. It didn't really make any sense to me,' she says. Julie Henderson, who fluctuates between a  size 12 and 14, told the publication: 'Fashion dictates so many things in our lives, and little girls grow up thinking that this is what beauty is.

Lacy and her husband Britt Martin, left, walk past TV cameramen after a news conference, Tuesday at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida . 'The stingray, at one point, abruptly left, and as I went to the surface, and I was vertical to the water column, and the shark hit me from behind,' she said in a press conference covered by WSVN. 'I knew immediately that it was a shark bite, and I also, in the top point in my mind, realized my husband was in the water.' 'When I surfaced, I knew I had to communicate what had happened to get my husband out of the water. 'Then I had to get my face back in the water so I could swim for the boat.' Ms Webb was filming a stingray underwater when she saw this shark swim by and she continued to film. The picture is from her underwater footage moments before the bite .

'I thought she was joking, and when she started pulling herself up, I saw the severity of the situation, and I immediately jumped on the boat and just started grabbing towels and realized we had to think quickly and to work quickly 'cause a life-or-death situation was happening.' Ms Webb was flown by air ambulance to Memorial Regional Hospital. She has undergone several operations and once released, she will need further reconstructive surgery.

"Whether she's going high-fashion in a Balmain campaign or popping out to the shops, Kim Kardashian never fails to look flawless. But you can guarantee the 33-year-old didn't roll out of bed looking that good. Indeed, the world famous reality TV star and fashion icon has a glam squad on hand 24 hours a day to help her look immaculate. One key cog in Kim's well-oiled machine is her make-up artist and old friend, Mario Dedivanovic. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian's make-up artist has shared his latest techniques for giving the star her flawless glow . Mario, who was the man that made sure she was picture-perfect for her and Kanye West's nuptials last year, has shared his latest tips and tricks behind perfecting Kim's contoured look. Speaking to Grazia Middle East, Mario shared his top tips for defining Kim's eyes, creating a flawless base and revealed how he gives her those glossy lips. He explained that to play up the drama of Kim's eyes, he uses a darker shade along her eye crease and a really light one to highlight her brow bone. Kim apparently loves wearing golden hues along her bottom lash and he uses liquid eyeliner 'winged up and out' to complete the look. Mario Dedivanovic met Kim on a make-up shoot in New York over five years ago and they've been working together ever since . Mario was the man that made sure she was picture-perfect for her and Kanye West's nuptials last year . Although she's one of the globe's wealthiest stars who could have her pick of the most high-end products, Kim is happiest when Mario uses drugstore brands. To give her lashes volume, he sweeps on two coats of L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara in Carbon Black. Revealing the key secret behind her famously contoured cheekbones, Mario says he swears by Giella Eye M Glam Highlighter - a sheer highlighting powder he created for the brand. He claims it gives you the most gorgeous, natural golden glow thanks to the  pure and natural mineral pigments that diffuse light and make the skin look more luminous. The multi-purpose product, which costs £23 ($35), can be used on the inner corners of eyes to separate and brighten them, on the brow bone to highlight and lift. It can also be mixed with moisturiser for all-over glow and mixed with water for a stronger application around the eyes. While you can use his product anywhere - even on the body - he is adamant that application is key. 'Always use a beauty blender sponge to blend in the layers of the product,' he advises. 'I apply some along her cheek bones to give a dewy effect, on the bridge of her nose and Cupid's bow and I also sweep it along her decolletage, shoulders and arms,' he added. Two of his key products for creating Kim's look are L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara in Carbon Black, left, and Giella Eye M Glam Highlighter by Mario Dedivanovic . If that wasn't enough contouring, he also applies it to the inner corners of her eyes to 'brighten and open' them. He likes to user higher-end products to play up Kim's lips, opting for nude tones by Lancome finished with a slick of gloss in a similar hue. 'To keep Kim looking fresh from day to evening, I use TATCHA Blotting Papers, which keep the skin from getting muddy in the heat,' he concludes. Mario, who met Kim on a make-up shoot in New York more than five years ago, said despite the global audience at Kim's wedding in 2014, he wasn't nervous about the very important role he played in her wedding.

"Swingers in tech-obsessed Silicon Valley have tuend to apps to help aid them in their sex partner swaps and alternative lifestyle parties. Where once there were random key exchanges, entrepreneurs like Ben Fuller have created technology to bring together San Francisco Bay engineers who fancy other techies' husbands and wives.

And by virtue of his clientele's profession, Fuller says he's always getting helpful hints and tweaks to the technology he uses. CNN's Laurie Segall, who interviewed Fuller, said in a recent Reddit AMA: . 'Lots of engineers, a mobile developer who worked at a big Silicon Valley company, a lawyer - all types.

"It's already had a claim to fame, with cups of the smoky-tasting tea being served at state dinners in Kensington Palace and Balmoral Castle. And now Dalreoch smoked white tea's status has been lifted even higher after the pricey brew - which costs £35 for 15g - was named as the best tea in the world. Grown by The Wee Tea Company, Scotland's first tea company in Perthshire, came up trumps at the Salon de The awards in Paris. They've got winning down to a T (from left to right): Derek Walker, Tam O'Brann and Jamie Russell run Scotland's first tea business, The Wee Tea Company in Perthshire . Flawless tea: The award-winning tea say benefits from the mountain air and fresh spring water . The business is the brainchild of trio Jamie Russell, 36, Derek Walker, 39, and Tam O'Brann, 44. Scientist Tam O'Braan, 44, said he was honoured to receive the award, after his business had been brewing steadily for four and a half years. The father-of-two, who runs the Wee Tea Plantation on Dalreoch Farm estate in Amulree, Perthshire, said: 'I suppose you could call me Mr Tea after winning such a major award. 'I'm proud to say our tea is the best in the world. 'This has been only our second season selling our tea so to get the highest honour in the whole world of tea is brilliant. 'I'm surprised that it has taken this long for someone in Scotland to grow tea. We have a great climate for it. 'I used to work for The World Food Programme and help out in several places where crops struggle to grow properly. 'My work for them took me to Wuhan which has an ancient tradition of growing tea 750 metres above sea level - which is the same height as our estate. 'This is ideal for tea because the clouds are quite low down which gives it good protection from any sunlight and the frequent rain helps as well.' The Wee Tea Company plantation is nestled in the foothills of the Scottish Highlands . A 15 gram tin of the prize-winning tea will set punters back £35 from Fortnum & Mason. Along with lawyer wife Gracie, 29, Tam gave up a globe-trotting lifestyle to finally settle on the Perthshire estate. They arrived in Scotland with experience of food research across five continents and joined up with old friends who had been running a high quality tea shop in Edinburgh. In October last year, their Big Country Brew was valued at £2,300 per kilogram - more than twenty times the price of ordinary tea. Mr Walker (left) and Mr Russell (right) sip on cups of their award-winning tea . Tam added: 'Scotland has such an incredible connection to the tea industry. 'For example, all of the original Darjeeling tea gardens were first planted by Scots and a Scot initially brought tea to Japan. 'We're very well located here in Perthshire as the soil in the ground can give the tea a nice, smoky flavour similar to many local whiskies.'","The Wee Tea Company's Dalreoch smoked white tea bagged the honour .

"Two male black bears stand on hind legs with their paws in the air as they prepare to fight... and one brave photographer had a ring-side seat at the boxing match. The 300lb animals were spotted in a wooded area of Ontario, Canada, as they tried to prove who's boss. Award-winning wildlife photographer Megan Lorenz, 39, stood just yards away and captured the bears on camera as they moved about battled each other. Scroll down for video . The two 300lb male black bears put up their fists in a wooded area of Ontario, Canada as they try to prove who's boss . The bears were photographed by award-winning wildlife photographer Megan Lorenz, who travelled to the region to chart the progress of the bears after the annual spring bear hunt had been restarted in 2014 after being cancelled since 1999 . She had travelled to the region to chart the progress of the bears after the annual spring bear hunt had been restarted in 2014 after being cancelled since 1999. Along with her photography partner Chris MacDonald, Lorenz has been studying the bears for years and was able to get remarkably close to the animals. As well as taking pictures of the thrilling battle between two males, Lorenz and MacDonald also got right up close to their subjects quite by accident as the bears moved around them. Lorenz said: 'The spring bear hunt was cancelled in 1999 after concerns that bear cubs were being orphaned and dying of starvation because their mothers were being killed. 'In 2014 the Province of Ontario reinstated the spring bear hunt in a few test areas. As a photographer you get very attached to the animals you photograph on a regular basis and sharing their location could put them in danger for various reasons. 'I was at times mere feet from one of the bears. This was not intentional on my part. While photographing bears which were farther away, one particular bear surprised me a few times by cutting out of the woods to my right and walking right in front of me. The male black bears can be seen standing on two legs with their paws in the air as they prepare to fight. Lorenz, 39, stood just yards away and captured the bears on camera as they moved about the wooded and grassy area . Along with her photography partner Chris MacDonald, Lorenz has been studying the bears for years and was able to get remarkably close to the animals . Black bears are found in most parts of North America and, despite being less dangerous to humans than their bigger grizzly cousins, adults can still weigh up to 300lb. Bears communicate their dominance by intimidating their opponent, but they do not fight with one another unless it's absolutely necessary. Fights risk injury, which is not the bear's objective. It's all about posturing. 'This was quite a surprise. I decided the best thing to do in that situation was to keep calm, talk to the bear in a low voice and wait until he moved on. 'If I was already down on my knees then I stayed there and when I was standing I moved back slowly without turning away from the young male bear. 'I never photograph the bears alone and my photography partner Chris MacDonald took the photos of me with the bear standing only feet away . 'The bears are in cottage country and are used to living in a populated area. He showed no aggression or warning signs that he was stressed. 'I was prepared and had bear spray on me but since they can move so quickly, the difference between a bear feet from you and a hundred feet away is only a split second. 'It's important not to run, to keep calm, read the bears' behaviour and interpret warning signs. 'Don't turn your back and if at all possible hike in groups of three or more people and stay together. 'Bears can be dangerous but the possibility of a bear harming a person is grossly overstated in my opinion. Bear encounters and attacks have been sensationalised and have created an unrealistic fear of bears. As well as taking pictures of the battle between two males, Lorenz and MacDonald also got right up close to their subjects quite by accident as the bears moved around them . 'I was prepared and had bear spray on me but since they can move so quickly, the difference between a bear feet from you and a hundred feet away is only a split second,' Lorenz said . 'Like any large predator, bears have the power to inflict horrible damage but they show tremendous restraint when dealing with people. Despite what most people are told, bears that allow themselves to be seen by people don't tend to be a threat to human safety. 'There have only been seven black bear attacks resulting in deaths by four bears in over 100 years in Ontario. It was a special moment for me but I'm not ashamed to admit that my heart started beating faster. 'We have been conditioned to think that all bears are out to kill us but I have witnessed their patience with people, acceptance and their curiosity. 'I think he was curious about me and my camera gear. I spent a considerable amount of time photographing them at that location and he was accustomed to seeing me around. 'My fear is that he will approach someone else and he could be deemed a nuisance and killed but I've been told that he and the other bears keep a safe distance from other people.' Lorenz revealed that the bear was curious about her and her camera gear. She had spent a lot of time photographing the bears in the area so they were accustomed to seeing her around . 'Like any large predator, bears have the power to inflict horrible damage but they show tremendous restraint when dealing with people.

"The taxpayer faces a bill of millions of pounds after a civil servant's elementary spelling mistake led to the collapse of a business employing 250 workers. Companies House wrongly said that engineering firm Taylor & Sons Ltd had been wound up - when in fact it was an unrelated company called Taylor & Son Ltd. As false rumours spread that the business was in trouble, customers cancelled their orders and credit facilities were withdrawn, leaving the 134-year-old firm unable to keep trading. Out of business: Taylor & Sons, pictured, went into administration thanks to an error by Companies House . Now a High Court judge has ruled that Companies House is liable for the firm's default, and must pay as much as £8.8million in compensation to its owner Philip Davison-Sebry. When Taylor & Son went out of business in February 2009, Companies House document examiner Philip Davies wrongly amended the companies register to say that it was Taylor & Sons which had ceased trading, the court heard. Collapse: Owner Philip Davison-Sebry, pictured, started to receive angry phone calls from clients . The blunder was corrected three days later - but word had already begun to spread that Taylor & Sons, based in Cardiff, was in financial trouble. Mr Davison-Sebry, 57, was on holiday at the time, and began to receive angry phone calls from clients asking why he had fled the country when his company was in liquidation. His lawyer Clive Freedman QC told the court that the firm's best customer, Tata Steel, quickly withdrew its £400,000-a-month business. And contracts to construct three Royal National Lifeboat Institution stations collapsed at a cost to Taylor & Sons of £3million. 'The business of the company was, effectively, irreparably destroyed,' he told the court. 'The business was damaged so as to become of no real value.' Mr Justice Edis ruled this week that Companies House was responsible for the the business, which was founded in 1875, entering administration two months after the mistake. He concluded: 'The reason why the Company went into administration in April 2009 was the error made by Mr Philip Davies.' The judge pointed to the fact that this is the only comparable blunder ever recorded on the companies register, saying: 'That can only be because it was easy to avoid.' Taylor & Sons, Mr Justice Edis added, had 'no way of protecting itself' against the error and its catastrophic consequences. The damage to the company was foreseeable and there had been an 'assumption of responsibility' by Companies House, he said. Error: It was in fact an unrelated firm called Taylor & Son which had gone out of business but the companies register was incorrectly amended . Compensation: Companies House, pictured, faces a compensation bill of up to £8.8million for its mistake . In handing victory to Mr Davison-Sebry, the judge said it was 'fair, just and reasonable' to hold Companies House liable for what happened. He said that while Taylor & Sons had run into difficulties during the recession, the mistake by Mr Davies - who has 33 years of experience in the field - was the 'precipitating factor' in its eventual collapse. The amount of damages payable by the State-owned body has yet to be determined, but Mr Davis-Sebry valued his claim at £8.8million. Companies House said in a statement today: 'Companies House has recently received the judgement in this case and is currently considering the implications at this time. Until these considerations are complete we remain unable to comment further.' A spokesman refused to say whether or not any employees had been disciplined over the expensive error.","When a company called Taylor & Son went out of business, Companies House recorded that Cardiff-based Taylor & Sons was being liquidated .

"Passenger satisfaction with the railways is at its lowest for five years, a report said yesterday. Fewer than one in three commuters on Britain’s worst performing railways are satisfied with their expensive, delayed and overcrowded services, it said. The number is ‘significantly down’ compared with a year ago – while dissatisfaction is soaring as three-quarters (77 per cent) are unhappy, it concluded. And for millions of commuters the published timetable is simply ‘a work of fiction’ because so many trains run late. Fewer than one in three commuters on Britain's worst performing railways are satisfied with their expensive delayed and overcrowded service (file picture) Passengers are being ‘let down’ by rail bosses – many cashing in big bonuses - against a background of soaring fares, poor punctuality and overrunning engineering works, it said. Nationally the rail watchdog’s report noted: ‘The biggest decline in satisfaction was with punctuality and reliability.’ Passenger Focus said the overall satisfaction figure of 81per cent – with one in five dissatisfied - was the lowest performance for more than 5 years. The last time it was that low was in Spring 2009. Before that, the lowest figure was 79 per cent in 2007. The report said the biggest impact on overall satisfaction was punctuality (38 per cent), followed by cleanliness inside the train (18 per cent), and speed of journey ( 8 per cent). The biggest impact on dissatisfaction came from how train companies deal with delays , with more than half (54 per cent) citing this. After than comes punctuality and reliability (14 per cent), and overcrowding (7 per cent). Rail chiefs apologised and admitted they ‘must do better.’ Worst value for money is South West Trains’s suburban services – dubbed by one leading MP as the ‘sardine line’ - and on Abellio Greater Anglia’s mainline service where just 29 per cent of people said they were satisfied. The Stansted Express won just 32 per cent satisfaction, as did the Gatwick Express and South West Trains’ service from Portsmouth to Waterloo. Tucked just behind them with just 33 per cent ‘value for money’ satisfaction rating is South Eastern’s Metro service, followed by its high speed service (34per cent) and Govia Thameslink’s Great Northern route, (35 per cent). Worst route for punctuality is Govia’s Thameslink South route with only just over half (56 per cent) satisfied with performance. Passengers feeling most overcrowded with standing room only (48 per cent) are on Abellio Greater Anglia’s Metro service (43 per cent). Govia’s Thameslink South service manages just 48 per cent. But South West Trains commuter routes to London (54 per cent) and mainline services (59mper cent) are also among the worst for passengers feeling the squeeze, as is London Overground from Richmond to Clapham Junction and Stratford (51 per cent). The report said the biggest impact on overall satisfaction was punctuality (38 per cent) (file picture) Midlanders feel the crush on London Midland’s commuter route to the capital (58 per cent) and on Cross Country services from Birmingham to Manchester and the South Coast (both 59 per cent). The damning evidence was published in a 60-page report by official consumer watchdog Passenger Focus following its survey of 27,000 passengers . Overall, one in five travellers say their train journey leaves something to be desired, with just 81per cent expressing satisfaction with their journey when questioned last autumn – a drop of 2percentage on the previous autumn. And study did not include the Christmas period, when trains into London King’s Cross were seriously disrupted. Lowest scoring train operators overall were Govia Thameslink and Southern (both with 77per cent) and Southeastern (74per cent). Southeastern’s overall satisfaction score fell 11percentage points compared to a year ago, while Cross Country’s dropped 4 percentage points. By contrast, the highest-scoring operators were Heathrow Express and Grand Central, (both 94per cent) and Chiltern (93per cent). Anthony Smith, chief executive of Passenger Focus, said: “Rail passengers’ satisfaction is driven by getting trains on time. Many are being let down - fare increases, billions in Government investment and promises of improvement don’t seem to be delivering change on the ground. He said; ‘Passengers do not care who is to blame for things going wrong and for some of them the timetable is a work of fiction. If it really is the case that better day-to-day performance can’t be achieved, then an honest, open debate is now needed so that passengers might be able to trust the promises made by the industry again.’ el Roberts, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, representing rail operators and Network Rail, said: ‘These results show how passenger satisfaction has been dipping after years of steady improvement and they reinforce our determination to do better. ‘The timetable is our promise to passengers, and too often we aren’t making good on this commitment.’","Fewer than one in three commuters on Britain's railways are satisfied .

"A huge fire has brought to end a mock Mars mission being held in the middle of the Utah desert. The mission involved four 'astronauts' living in isolation for two weeks in the hope of recreating the psychological effects of life on Mars. But instead, they were dealt with a real-life emergency when an accidental fire destroyed part of the Mars Desert Research Station, with flames reaching 10ft (3 metres) high. A huge fire has brought to end a mock Mars mission being held in the middle of the Utah desert. The mission involved four 'astronauts' living in isolation in the hope of recreating the psychological effects of life on Mars . The Mars Society, who runs the missions, said that no one was hurt among the crew who attempted to battle the flames on their own for over an hour. According to Space.com, crew Commander Nick Orenstein, spotted smoke billowing from the greenhouse and ran outside to take a look. 'This is a moment where instinct took over, the instinct of fight or flight, and we had fight,' Orenstein told Space.com. 'There really wasn't a question at the moment.' The Mars Society, who runs the missions, said that no one was hurt among the crew who attempted to battle the flames. Pictured on the right is the damaged it caused and the left image shows the MDRS . The middle of the greenhouse (pictured), which was called the GreenHab, was destroyed and an investigation found that an electrical heater placed too close to shelves caused the flames . The middle of the greenhouse, which was called the GreenHab, was destroyed and an investigation found that an electrical heater placed too close to shelves caused the flames. Orenstein's crew stayed in Hanksville, four miles from the habitat, and commuted back and forth to MDRS and coordinated with emergency officials before deciding to end the simulation on December 31. The GreenHab that was destroyed was the second greenhouse built at MDRS, after the first one collapsed under heavy winds. 'The GreenHab fire was very unfortunate, and the crew that bravely dealt with the incident ended their simulation early,' Michael Stoltz, the Mars Society's Director of Media told MailOnline. During their stay, the astronaut's home is the Habitat Module, a two storey silo-shaped building with lab areas and living spaces, eight metres in diameter . 'But the Mars Desert Research Station is up and running, albeit temporarily without greenhouse experiments, which is just one aspect of the important research being done at the facility. 'Another crew arrived at the Utah station a week or so after the fire to begin their two week Mars field simulation. We're back to preparing for Mars exploration and settlement.' A volunteer for the mock mission, Elizabeth Howell, had previously told MailOnline that the mission can be overwhelming. 'When I was in a spacesuit I felt like I was in an outside world,' she said. 'It makes you think and behave differently.' During their stay, the astronaut's home is the Habitat Module, a two storey silo-shaped building with lab areas and living spaces, eight metres in diameter. The Mars Society said they will aim to have a replacement structure ready in time for next batch of 'astronauts' to live at the Utah station . sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive', Nasa chiefs have said. Speaking at the Humans to Mars summit in Washington, head of the US space programme Charles Bolden, said last year: 'If this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species, we need to go to Mars, and Mars is a stepping stone to other solar systems.' Mr Bolden revealed plans for the series of 'stepping stones' to the red planet, which included 'lassoing' an asteroid.It also included growing plants in space, and using 3D printers for onboard repairs. Nasa plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon's orbit, send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip. The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip . Leaving the Habitat Module requires a request to Mission Support a day in advance. Even then, they have to put on an unwieldy spacesuit. The suits worn by the scientists come with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots. Contact with the outside world is strictly limited, with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day. Most communication is with 'mission control', who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts. That includes details on their food intake, exercise, and psychological status. The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip. The shortest possible journey to Mars is 140 million miles, a trip that is thought to take around seven months.

"A South Carolina judge on Wednesday vacated the 54-year-old trespassing convictions of a group of black civil rights protesters credited with reinvigorating the 1960s U.S. sit-in movement against segregated lunch counters. The 'Friendship Nine,' a group of mostly students at the now-closed Friendship College, agreed to risk arrest by sitting at the McCrory's five-and-dime store lunch counter in Rock Hill on January 31, 1961 . 'There is only one reason these men were arrested ... and that is because they were black,' prosecutor Kevin Brackett said at a packed hearing in Rock Hill that was attended by surviving members of the group. 'It was wrong then, it’s wrong today.' Scroll down for video . Today in court: One of the Friendship Nine, Clarence Graham, cries tears of joy in court today as his conviction is dropped 54 years later . Civil Rights: In this February 1960 file photo, people take part in a civil rights 'sit-in' protest at the lunch counter in McCrory's in South Carolina where the Friendship Nine staged  a  protest at the same lunch counter in 1961 . Dropped convictions: This South Carolina judge, pictured in court today, vacated the 54-year-old trespassing convictions of some black civil rights protesters credited with reinvigorating the 1960s U.S. sit-in movement . Punished for protest: View of the Friendship 9 students who protested against racial discrimination and were put in prison in Rock Hill, South Carolina in April 1964 . Full house: Crowds gather in the municipal courthouse during a hearing for a group of black civil rights protesters nicknamed the 'Friendship Nine' in Rock Hill, South Carolina today . The fact that these civil rights era crimes will no longer be on their records has brought mixed feelings to the men. Their refusal to pay bail money into the segregationist town's city coffers served as a catalyst for other civil disobedience. Inspired by their courage, demonstrators across the South adopted their 'jail not bail' tactic and filled jail cells. The media attention helped turn scattered protests into a nationwide movement. 'Everything that happened, happened for a reason,' W.T. 'Dub' Massey, one of the nine, told The Associated Press. 'We have to continue what we're doing. If we're backing off from what we've done, then there's a problem here.' Massey and seven other students at Rock Hill's Friendship Junior College — Willie McCleod, Robert McCullough, Clarence Graham, James Wells, David Williamson Jr., John Gaines and Mack Workman — were encouraged to violate the town's Jim Crow laws by Thomas Gaither, who came to town as an activist with the Congress of Racial Equality. About a year had passed since a sit-in at a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, helped galvanize the nation's civil rights movement. Making history: James F. Wells writes his signature on a book about the 'Friendship Nine', a group of black civil rights protesters arrested for trespassing in 1961 . But change was slow to come to Rock Hill. They decided to challenge matters by getting arrested in February 1961 for ordering lunch at McCrory's variety store, and were convicted of trespassing and breach of peace. Author Kim Johnson, who published 'No Fear For Freedom: The Story of the Friendship 9""' last year, went to Kevin Brackett, the solicitor for York and Union counties, to see what could be done to clean their records. 'This is an opportunity for us to bring the community together,' Johnson told the AP. 'To have the records vacated essentially says that it should have never happened in the first place.' Brackett's request to a Rock Hill judge comes too late for McCullough, who died in 2006. Racial equality: James F.

But some of the others returned to town ahead of the hearing to reflect on their experience, saying they hope their actions can still have an effect. 'It's been a long wait,' Graham said. 'We are sure now that we made the right decision for the right reason. Being nonviolent was the best thing that we could have done.' The men's names are engraved on the stools at the counter of the restaurant on Main Street, now called the Old Town Bistro. A plaque outside marks the spot where they were arrested. And official and personal apologies have been offered to the men over the years. In 2009, a white man named Elwin Wilson who tried to pull one of the protesters from a stool nearly 50 years earlier returned to the same counter, meeting with some of the men. They forgave him. And although their records will soon be clean, the men hope their commitment to nonviolence can remain an example for people protesting various issues today. 'Maybe it might change some of their minds about some of their actions,' Graham said. 'Until the hearts change, there won't be any changes. We still insist that nonviolence is the way to go.'","54 years after they were sentenced to a month of hard labor for ordering lunch in South Carolina, nine black men had their conviction dropped .

"British war planes were yesterday scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth. Typhoon jets on high alert were dispatched from two RAF bases and flew alongside the long-range Russian Bear aircraft until they were out of the region. Last night experts said Vladimir Putin’s move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression. Off you go: A Russian Bear is escorted by an RAF jet during an alert in September. (File picture) They said the manoeuvre in the English Channel could have been designed to ‘probe the RAF speed of reaction’ – raising fears that the Russians were looking for weaknesses in the British fighter force. Within seconds of the bombers deviating from their usual flight path, the British quick reaction alert (QRA) jets were scrambled. A defence source said the RAF always ‘maintains the highest level of readiness’, just as in the days of Battle of Britain. The Typhoons were dispatched from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. They were so close to the Russian planes – roughly 1,000ft away – that they could signal to the pilots. A QRA is launched to intercept aircraft that cannot be identified by any other means. In this case, the Russians would either not have filed a flight plan, not transmitted a recognisable surveillance radar code, or failed to talk to air traffic control. Elizabeth Quintana, of defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said: ‘This case is very unusual. Normally Russian Bears come past Norway and down the North Sea. It could have been used to probe the RAF speed of reaction south.’ In a reference to the inquiry into the poisoning of former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko in London, she said: ‘Flying any military aircraft in or close to the sovereign airspace of another country signals displeasure or at worst aggression.’ While the bombers were in international airspace, they were deviating from a standard route. Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled in October to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers . Followed: These RAF images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by Typhoons near British airspace . A defence ministry spokesman said: ‘Typhoons were launched after Russian aircraft were identified flying close to UK airspace. ‘The Russian planes were escorted until they were out of the UK area of interest. At no time did they cross into UK airspace.’ A source added: ‘Why would you want to send Russian strategic bombers this far down? There is the Ukraine crisis and there is the Litvinenko trial but I wouldn’t like to speculate. If we knew the aircraft did have cruise missiles on it and was ready to use them, it wouldn’t last very long.’ The two Bears were escorted for about half an hour as they passed over the Channel and south of Bournemouth and Portsmouth. They then returned to their normal route, flying around Ireland and up past the tip of Scotland. During this time it is likely the RAF will have been communicating to the Russian pilots through their radios. In October, Typhoons intercepted another Russian Bear over the North Sea and Russian warships passed through the Channel and had to be escorted by the Navy.","Typhoon jets flew alongside the long-range bombers over the Channel .

"It seems this week's tempestuous Winter Storm Juno has proved itself to be quite the aphrodisiac. Location-based mobile dating app Hinge - similar in nature to Tinder - has reported a significant surge in traffic during the hours immediately leading up to East Coast blizzard chaos, according to The Huffington Post. Hinge's marketing director Karen Fein said that Monday started out like any typical day, but that the app saw a 27per cent spike in the number of logins between the hours of 3pm and 10pm - just as many East Coasters were sent home from work early to hunker down and wait for the blizzard to hit. Off to a stormy start! According to Hinge, Monday started out like any typical day, but the app saw a 27per cent spike in the number of East Coast logins between 3pm and 10pm - just as the blizzard was brewing . Hinge links users on the basis of two factors; proximity, like Tinder, and social 'friends of friends' connections, using data from Facebook. According to the company, 99per cent of its users are college-educated, most commonly working in industries such as banking, media and fashion. On average, Hinge users logged into the app a record number of 4.75 times on Monday. The company declined to release more detailed user statistics. 'Most of our users are young professionals and knew work would be closed,' said Ms Fein. 'Who wouldn't want a playdate on a snow day?' According to ABC News, this phenomenon was echoed across the board, with dating site Match.com reporting a 60 per cent traffic spike in 'blizzard states', and OKCupid seeing a ten per cent lift in activity. Home time! As East Coast workers left the office early - around 3pm - to hunker down for the blizzard, Hinge saw a sharp spike in activity (pictured) Heating up: A slew of Craigslist ads seeking 'snuggle buddies' have apparently emerged, mainly in New York and Connecticut, with people posting requests for strangers to join them for lock down . Uplift: Shopping platform Lyst  reported a pre-blizzard spike in New York-based web traffic for its luxury lingerie section, with page views for Agent Provocateur up by more than 500per cent . In addition, a slew of Craigslist ads seeking 'snuggle buddies' apparently emerged in advance of the storm, mainly in New York and Connecticut, with people posting requests for strangers to join them for lock down. One Craigslist poster was looking for a storm-partner to share 'endless movies, red wine, potential igloo-making... and making out.' Another was seeking a 'cute woman' to 'have fun and keep warm with'. Even sexy lingerie sales were up across regions in which a decent storm-battering was expected. Shopping platform Lyst reported a sudden, unexpected spike in New York-based web traffic for its very pricey underwear section just ahead of the blizzard. Page views for Agent Provocateur - with prices averaging $700 a bra - increased by more than 500per cent between the weekend and Tuesday morning. Myla, La Perla and Kiki de Montparnasse also saw an uplift in traffic. For those New Yorkers who did splash out on expensive lingerie, however, or line up dates in the hopes of eschewing the office on Monday, there was disappointment all round. Juno failed to live up to its 'worst storm in history' expectations, instead only dumping New York with about ten inches at the most. Parts of New England, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and Massachusetts, however, did get hammered by the snow - with Boston worst hit yesterday. So for those who did get lucky on dating sites in the wake of Juno, this could be the start of some very stormy relationships.","Location-based dating app Hinge saw a 27% activity spike between the hours of 3pm and 10pm, just before the storm hit the East Coast .

"Drones have been snooping on people and places from the air for some time, but until now they have largely been unable to reveal aquatic goings on. The HexH2o claims to be a commercial waterproof drone that can land on water so its camera can film what is going on below the waves. The drone’s pilot can control the camera to capture videos of fish or whatever else is living in a sea or lake. Scroll down for video . Revolutionary? The HexH2o claims to be the world’s first commercial waterproof drone that houses a gimbal allowing users to capture footage through its large viewing dome both in the air and underwater (pictured) Engineers at Thailand-based QuadH2O are selling the drone in kit form, as well as in pre-made ‘ready to fly’ form. The drone has six propellers so it’s easily manoeuvrable and has a fibre composite body, making it strong but lightweight. It’s designed to carry the GoPro 3 and 4 camera and has a gimbal to ensure videos are stable when they are shot both above and below water. The 'viewing dome' protecting the camera is made of perspex, while other parts are 3D printed or crafted from carbon. Life below the ocean waves: The drone’s pilot can control the camera to capture videos of fish or whatever else is living in a sea or lake. On the left, the drone is landed on calm water and right, a view is shown from video footage taken from just below the surface of the water . Screwdrivers at the ready! The HexH2o comes in kit form, pictured, and or ready-made. ‘All you need to do it add your chosen flight battery, strap on your GoPro, make a few checks, calibrate your compass and fly,’ the firm said of its more expensive option . Filming: Aerial shots and underwater footage are possible using a gimbal and GoPro3 or 4. Rotors: Six, with fold-able arms. Flight time: Up to 25 minutes. Speed: The drone is fast and agile, to keep up with speed boats and jet skis. Weight: 10.4 lbs (4.7kg) when fully loaded. It's been designed to be a sealed, water-tight unit, with the exception of two 'breather tubes' which allow the barometer to measure outside air pressure. The makers say: ‘You can land and take off from water and even manoeuvre on the water allowing you to capture amazing “underwater” footage before flying away.’ Flight time depends on flight conditions, as well as how the components are set up, but the drone can fly or 'swim' for up to 25 minutes. Fully loaded, the drone weighs 10.4 lbs (4.7kg) and can be controlled using a DJI Naza, which is the most popular flight controller for multirotor drones. The HexH2o pre-order costs were listed at $895 (£588) in kit form and $979 (£644) ready-made, but retail prices will be released next week. ‘All you need to do it add your chosen flight battery, strap on your GoPro, make a few checks, calibrate your compass and fly,’ the firm said of its more expensive option.

"It has been dubbed a NASA experiment, a spy device and a giant film projector by curious onlookers. But the massive silver cantilevered platform hanging from the 28th floor of the luxurious $2 billion One Central Park in Sydney is none of the above. It is actually a feature of a one-of-a-kind 110-tonne steel heliostat - a device used to reflect sunlight to another area. This massive silver cantilevered platform hanging from the 28th floor of One Central Park in Sydney has been described as a NASA experiment, a spy device and a giant film projector by curious onlookers . The feature, designed by One Central Park architect Jean Nouvel and PTW Architects, serves two purposes, Fairfax Media reports. It's an architectural design element and an engineered way to reflect light into the dark corridor beneath it. Frasers Property director Paul Lowe says the silver feature, which has been completed for about a year, still gets compared to a NASA experiment and a dream light-box. 'We believe the heliostat is unique to a residential structure - it is probably the only one we know of in existence here or around the world,' he said.

"Budweiser's new Super Bowl commercial is a heartwarming account of a lost puppy's trek back home with the help of a few of Clydesdale horses -- and is set to air on February 1 as the Seattle Seahawks play the New England Patriots. At the start of 'Lost Dog', a rancher is seen leading a Clydesdale into a stall. A puppy then pokes his head out of hay in the stall and runs out of the stable, while looking back at the horse. Once outside, however, the curious puppy spies a truck with its back door open, runs over and hops inside. However, the pooch gets trapped when the door suddenly shuts. Why hello there! The puppy pokes its head out of a haystack then rushes out the door . Breaking free: The puppy soon races past the rancher and a Clydesdale horse . Trapped: The puppy looks back at the truck door after it suddenly shuts . Have you seen me? The farm's rancher is seen posting a sign looking for the pooch . The advertisement, which premiered on Today, is set to a soundtrack of The Proclaimers' 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' covered by Sleeping at Last. The puppy jumps out of the truck when it's stopped in traffic and runs down a street. Now lost, the puppy shelters in a box when it starts to rain before traversing a muddy field in the darkness. While the puppy is away from home, the rancher is seen tending to a horse in the stable looking forlorn and posting a 'lost dog' sign on a tree. The puppy - covered in mud - finally makes its way down a hill toward the farm it calls home, only to be faced by a growling wolf. Huddled up: The puppy gets out of the truck and at one point takes shelter in a box during the rain . Homecoming: The puppy finally makes its way back toward the farm to be with the rancher and the Clydesdale horses after its long journey . As the two unequally matched canines have a standoff, several Clydesdales break free from their stalls and run to serve as the puppy's backup, scaring the snarling wolf away. But as it grows light, the rancher looks out of his window and sees the puppy and the Clydesdales running back toward the farm and the group are reunited. The puppy and the Clydesdales were first used together for marketing the Super Bowl in 2014. The company's 2013 and 2014 campaigns won Ad Meter Crowns, Today reported. Director Jake Scott told Today 'Without giving it away too much, we're focused more maybe on the puppy than in past. Telling the story through the puppy's eyes.' 'I'm a glorified extra,' actor Don Jeanes, who plays the rancher, told the television show. 'I understand that. You can't compete. Hey, what's the kid's name from ""Lassie""? I don't know.'

"Beef and lamb should be given the chop to help save the planet, the government has warned. Cutting down on eating red meat in favour of more fruit and vegetables will free up land for forests to absorb greenhouse gases, a new study for the Department for Energy and Climate Change says. People in Britain must curb their meat intake and travel less to meet emissions targets which would then allow them to have larger, warmer homes. Cutting down on eating red meat in favour of more fruit and vegetables will free up land for forests to absorb greenhouse gases, a new study for the Department for Energy and Climate Change says . Ministers claim the report 'Prosperous living for the world in 2050' shows that limiting global temperatures to a 2°C rise can be achieved while improving living standards. It looks at changes which can be easily made to lifestyles to reduce environmental impacts, allowing other behaviour which is less damaging. It is claimed the Global Calculator tool, part funded by Climate-KIC, will allow to world to 'eat well, travel more, live in more comfortable homes, and meet international carbon reduction commitments'. But it urges people to reduce beef and lamb consumption, as a key way to prevent deforestation. In the last decade almost 200 million hectares of native forest land has been cut down, the report says, partly driven by increased demand for agricultural land. Demand for food around the world is expected to rise by up to 45 per cent by 2050, but forests need to expand by 5-15 per cent to absorb enough carbon dioxide from the atmoshphere. To produce a kilo of beer per year requires 28.5m² of land, compared to only 0.5m² for the same amount of fruit and vegetables . The report suggests the number of cows grazing on grassland to increase from 0.6 per hectare today to up to 1 per hectare by 2050. 'Switching away from beef consumption, towards more poultry, pork, vegetables and grains can significantly reduce the amount of land required to produce food,' the reports says. 'For example, currently an area the size of a football pitch can be used to produce 250 kg of beef, 1,000 kg of poultry (both fed on grains and residues) or 15,000 kg of fruit and vegetables. 'Decreasing the amount of meat in the global average diet would also have benefits for our climate and human health.' Swapping from beef and lamb for poultry and pork would require much less land to produce per kilogram. 'This change in the type of meat we eat could free up 290 million hectares of land, otherwise used for animal feed and pasture, to ultimately become land for forests, which acts a carbon sink and reduces the need for abatement elsewhere.' The World Health Organisation's definition of a healthy diet includes 2,100 calories on average, of which 160 calories is meat. If everyone stuck to these limits it could reduce emissions by the euiavalenet of a third of total global CO2 emissions in 2011. 'Smart use of our land could ensure we can protect or even expand our forests, produce all the food we need, and increase land for bioenergy from 98 million hectares today to up to 350 million hectares by 2050.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted everyone in the world can prosper while limiting global temperature . Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'For the first time this Global Calculator shows that everyone in the world can prosper while limiting global temperature rises to 2°C, preventing the most serious impacts of climate change. 'Yet the calculator is also very clear that we must act now to change how we use and generate energy and how we use our land if we are going to achieve this green growth. 'The UK is leading on climate change both at home and abroad. Britain's global calculator can help the world's crucial climate debate this year. Along with the many country-based 2050 calculators we pioneered, we are working hard to demonstrate to the global family that climate action benefits people.'","People in Britain urged to curb red meat intake to meet emissions targets .

"Former U.S. President Bill Clinton isn't eyeing a return to the White House just yet, but he is thinking about what people will call him if his wife Hillary – the former first lady – becomes the 45th president. First gentleman? FGOTUS? First man? 'Let's say, if a woman became president, we could – I could be called 'Adam.' I don't know,' Mr. Clinton told cooking show host Rachael Ray on Thursday, according to snippets released before the episode aired. The idea of the legendary lothario as 'first gentleman' usually brings eye-rolls from conservatives and lip-biting from liberals, but Hillary Clinton is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic Party's nomination next year. Given some of her husband's extracurricular activities during his 8-year presidency, having this particular 'gentleman' in the White House again – this time in the East Wing – would become an endless source of entertainment for late-night TV hosts. TANNED, RESTED AND READY: Bill Clinton said Thursday that it's up to his wife Hillary what to call him if she wins the 2016 presidential contest . Clinton joked with Rachael Ray that as 'first man' his nickname might become 'Adam' READY FOR HILLARY: Mrs. Clinton has been first lady, a US senator and secretary of state – and now reportedly wants the ultimate brass ring . When Hillary ran in 2008, Mr. Clinton told ABC News that he would 'not get underfoot too much' at the White House. 'I don't want to get in the way,' he said then. 'I want to do what I am asked to do and what I am needed to do.' He planned to have an East Wing office and a staff, and also to keep his New York City office at the Clinton Foundation's office. 'It's also not bad for America to have a former president out there helping people solve their problems,' Clinton added. 'I think that I could do a lot of double time, like if she wanted me to go someplace to work with some problem, I could also be doing my foundation work.' In 2007 at the Aspen Ideas Festival, he suggested a twist on 'first lady,' saying a Scottish friend told him to embrace the title 'first laddie' instead.' Officially, the Clintons would be introduced at public functions as 'The President of the United States and President Clinton,' according to White House protocol guidelines. Similarly, when George W. Bush was presdient and his father would visit for formal events, press guidelines referred to them as 'The President of the United States and President Bush.' If former Florida Governor Jeb Bush were to become president and his father were still around, the White House troika would be introduced at his inauguration as 'The President of the United States, President George W. Bush and President George H.W. Bush.' But in the Clintons' orbit, Bill is already thinking past the first female president. 'You know, if the president is a man, you call the president's spouse 'the first lady,' he told Ray, 'so we'll have to cross this bridge if a gay couple [is ever in the White House].' 'We're joking about this,' Clinton said, 'but it's a serious decision. Serious decision for Hillary, serious decision for the country, and the world.' 'Look, I love my wife. Whatever she wants to do, I'm for. I think it'd be good for the country because she's the ablest person I've ever worked with.' 'If she decided not to do it,' he said, imagining the politically unlikely, 'I'd give her the bucket list, and we'd go check 'em off.' That, at least, would remove the quirky question of what to call him. Meet the first gentleman: Clinton could return to the White House with a lot less responsibility this time around . POWER COUPLE: The Clintons could be the ultimate epicenter of American influence if Hillary wins the White House . When 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska, her husband Todd preferred to go by the honorific 'first dude.' The title 'first lady' doesn't actually refer to the president's wife, but to the designated 'hostess' at the White House. 'First Lady' is the title of the hostess of the White House, not the President's wife. America has elected unmarried presidents, whose other female relatives filled the role. James Buchanan never married; Grover Cleveland was wed while in office. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren and Chester Arthur were widowers when they were elected. The wives of John Tyler, Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilsondied during their presidencies. Technically speaking, America's youngest first lady was Chelsea Clinton – from Jan 3, 2000 to Jan 20, 2000. During those 18 days, her father was still president while her mother had left the White House to become a U.S. senator. YOUNGEST FIRST LADY: Chelsea Clinton was technically first lady for 18 days in 2000, while her father was president and her mother was getting used to being a US senator . So it's conceivable that if Bill Clinton chose to live outside the White House during a Hillary presidency, someone else – like Chelsea's husband Marc Mezvinsky – could be the 'first gentleman.' He's a hedge fund manager on Wall Street, though, so he probably wouldn't like the new ZIP code. Former first lady Laura Bush, in an interview with C-SPAN last year, mused about how the press scrutinized her fashion sense and hairdos, saying the spouse of the first female president shouldn't be let off the hook. 'Maybe we should be that way about the first gentleman also,' she said. 'and really critique the way they look all the time. Their choice of tie, or their hairstyle, or whatever.' 'Or maybe their weight,' she joked. Bill Clinton was on Ray's show Thursday to hep her make a 'healthy game-day chili' for Super Bowl Sunday.","In a riff on 'first man,' Former president told cooking show host Rachael Ray that 'I could be called 'Adam.' I don't know'
He would likely still be referred to as 'Mr. President,' the same as today, but he said in 2007 that he liked a Scottish friend's idea: 'first laddie'
'President Clinton' would suddenly no longer be enough to distinguish the two spouses .
'First gentleman' has been the traditional choice in other countries .
Sarah Palin's husband actually went by 'First Dude' when she was Alaska's governor ."
"A three-month-old baby has died a month after he was found covered in vomit and living in a filthy, cockroach-infested home with his seven older siblings. Donald Hemmings III passed away on January 20, exactly a month after his father, Donald Hemmings Jr., 42, and Geneva Morgan, 39, were arrested by North Las Vegas police for neglect. Baby Donald and seven other children, aged nine months, one, three, seven, 11, 13 and 17, were discovered inside the home while officers served a search warrant during a robbery investigation. The baby, who was placed in another home, died in hospital after he was found unresponsive in a home this month, but his cause of death is not yet known, the Review-Journal reported. Officers from North Las Vegas Police discovered the baby and his seven siblings living in a filthy apartment as they investigated a robbery last month. The three-month-old has now passed away, authorities said . Family Services wrote in a January 23 report that 'no abuse or neglect is suspected with the death'. The North Las Vegas Police were unable to comment on whether the boy's death was accidental, natural or the result of criminal action, and said an investigation is underway. The youngster was found living in conditions North Las Vegas Police called 'an extreme environmental hazard' in a December 20, 2014 report. When officers entered the apartment, they found cockroaches crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling, and even across the children as they shared one bed. Some of the children in the home were Hemmings' and others were Morgan's. The rooms were littered with dirty linen and garbage stacked several feet high, according to the report. There was also a broken toilet inside the home filled with human waste, police said. The baby was found sleeping inside the home with vomit on his face, the report said. As many as 12 people lived in the home, but there were only a few boxes of food and loose deli meat in the freezer, according to the Review-Journal. When Child Protective Services stepped in, it emerged that Morgan had at least 12 prior abuse and neglect investigations against her. Cases from 2008, 2010 and 2014 stemmed from filthy living conditions, infant drug exposure and for the children missing school. She was also accused of child neglect in 1997. Hemmings had prior arrests stemming from marijuana and traffic offenses. In this case, Morgan and Hemmings were each charged with eight counts of felony child abuse and neglect.","Donald Hemmings III passed away on January 20, exactly a month after he was found living in a garbage-filled home in Las Vegas with seven siblings .

Scroll down for video . A UPS driver has been fired after a Houston homeowner posted a security video online showing the delivery man throwing a parcel over a gate and urinating against his house . The video shows the delivery man walk up to Lucas' front gate. When the man realizes that the gate is locked he tosses the box over the fence instead of simply leaving the package on the ground . The force of throwing the package over the gate caused the packaging to split open and resulted in hundreds of dollars worth of damage to the contents that included .22 caliber ammunition, chemicals and a machine used to clean gun parts. To add insult to injury, the UPS driver then unzipped his pants and urinated on the side of Lucas' house. 'So basically I paid someone to come to my house and pee on it,' Lucas told Click2Houston. He got in contact UPS and offered to send them the video, but was very disappointed when a company official offered no real apology and seemed more concerned about the package damage than the urination. Lucas also said no one at the company seemed interested in seeing the video. 'I just wanted them to hear me and maybe give me an email address where I could send them the video,' said Lucas. 'They simply just didn't want to see it.' To add insult to injury, the UPS driver then unzipped his pants and urinated on the side of Lucas' house . Disappointed by what he felt was a lack of concern from the company, Lucas posted the video to social media and promptly caught the company's full attention. He soon got a call from a UPS divisional manager who had seen the video. She offered a full apology and suggested sending over a 'we're sorry' gift. 'That's what I kind of wanted. I just wanted someone to say, 'yeah he shouldn't have done that we'll try to make sure that doesn't happen again,'' said Lucas. The company has said the seasonal employee was fired because his behavior was unacceptable and his actions violated decency and delivery care. 'UPS was dismayed by actions that violated decency and delivery care. The local management team did take action to terminate the individual who was a seasonal delivery helper,' said the company in a statement. 'However, they were wrong if they did not clarify this resolution with Mr. Lucas at the time. UPS sincerely apologizes to our customer. No behavior like this is acceptable.'

"Many rail fares have more than trebled in the two decades since privatisation – with some open return tickets now costing more than the price of taking a family to the Mediterranean or a solo flight to New York, research reveals. Britain’s leading rail fare analyst has calculated that fares on some of the most popular routes have increased by between 141 per cent and 246 per cent over the past 20 years, while inflation has gone up by 77 per cent over the same period. The study of ‘anytime’ open return fares – the most expensive and most flexible ‘walk-up tickets’ – shows how an open return to Manchester with Virgin Trains has rocketed from £96 in 1995 to £329 today, an increase of 243 per cent. How do they compare? Driving or flying can now be cheaper than catching the train - even for solo journeys . That is more than eight times the cost of an open return National Express coach journey at £39.50 and enough to pay for a family of four flying on Ryanair to Barcelona (£184) or Athens (£240). It would also pay for a flight to Rome on Norwegian Air (£240), or a single traveller flying to New York for £334 with Kuwait Airways. The fare findings follow a damning report this week by rail watchdogs showing that rail travellers have registered the lowest level of satisfaction with the railways in five years. They were annoyed by overcrowded, expensive and late-running services. In January fares rose across all types of tickets by an average of 2.2 per cent. But season tickets went up by 2.5 per cent – not only well above the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation figure but also in excess of most annual pay rises. Customer dissatisfaction has been compounded by anger over ‘fat cat bonuses’ awarded to rail chiefs, which have been branded ‘rewards for failure’. Expensive: The comparison was carried out 20 years after the privatisation of the railways in Britain . Return tickets pre-booked . £41   BARCELONA . £53   ATHENS . £62   ROME . £94   MARRAKECH . £95   DUBROVNIK . £150  ST PETERSBURG . £282  DUBAI . £334  NEW YORK . Source: Skyscanner . Barry Doe, an independent fares expert, was commissioned to carry out research on rising ticket prices by the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) union. His research shows that an open return rail ticket between London and Bristol has soared by 246 per cent – from £57 to £197. The anytime fare from the capital to Liverpool has jumped by 232 per cent from £93 to £309, while to Cardiff it has increased by 211 per cent from £70 to £218. This makes cars a cost-effective alternative to rail travel – especially for families. AA president Edmund King said: ‘For the cost of my annual rail season ticket – a painful £4,028 – I could buy a second-hand car for £1000, tax and insure it and still have enough to pay for 20,000 miles of petrol, which is two years’ motoring for the average driver.’ A spokesman for Virgin Trains defended the £329 return anytime fare from London to Manchester, noting that a fraction of travellers paid it and most chose from a range of cheaper flexible options. They added: ‘Over the last year the number of passengers travelling on the standard anytime fare of £164.50 one way and £329 return represented only 3.7 per cent of the journeys made between London and Manchester. An open return to Edinburgh even with nationalised East Coast costs £313 - up from £130 two decades ago . Many of our advanced fares from Manchester remained the same or came down in January – overall our fares increased by 1.4 per cent which is significantly below the industry average.’ A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents Network Rail and train operators, said: ‘The TSSA’s figures are misleading in the extreme as they deliberately focus only on the most expensive fares. On average, the cost of rail travel has increased by 6 per cent in real terms over the last 15 years. ‘This helps explain why passenger numbers have almost doubled over the period, contributing to a fivefold increase in money going back to reinvest in a better railway.’ But Labour’s transport spokesman Michael Dugher said: ‘Rail passengers are being let down and ripped off. Things have got worse on our railways.’ And TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said: ‘Passengers have paid a terrible price for this political folly. The private rail industry has taken all the gain while passengers have suffered all the pain. Passengers have paid a small fortune on fares while rail bosses are paid a fortune. ‘We want to end this persecution of passengers which started after privatisation.’ He added: ‘It is hardly surprising that satisfaction is falling when commuters are paying record fares for a worsening service. It is an absolute disgrace.’","Open return from London to Manchester has soared from £96 to £329 .

"A French bulldog-pug puppy has to wear bandages on all four legs after suffering horrific injuries which are believed to have happened during dog-fights. Five-month-old Hero was found by a dog warden in a park in Hull, East Yorkshire, where he was hobbling around and whining in pain. He had deep lacerations and bite marks on his legs, which are believed to have happened when he was used as dog bait - a 'sport' where smaller canines are restrained and savaged by larger ones. Hero the five-month-old puppy was found abandoned in a park in Hull, East Yorkshire, with horrific injuries . Hero with his legs in bright pink casts after he was found hobbling around Pearson Park and whining in pain . The dog warden took him to an emergency vets, which found that his wounds about three days old, and he had been wandering around alone and in pain for that time in the bitter January weather. As a result his injuries were worse and infection had set in and now has had to have all four of his legs put in bandage, which have to be changed every day. He also has to wear a cone to stop him scratching an ulcerated eye. Hero is being cared for by an animal trust and is due to undergo an operation after his skin was left so badly damaged its likely it will die off. Appalling: Staff at the animal trust caring for Hero believe he may have suffered the injuries when he was used as bait in dog fights, or they could be from getting caught in thick wire . Hull Animal Welfare Trust, which believes the animal was being used as bait before it was dumped in Pearson Park, has launched its 'Help For Hero appeal' to raise the £2,000 needed for his care. Amy Bryan, centre manager, said: 'We are not sure how he received his injuries. Either he got caught in thick wire or, what we think is more likely the case, he has been used as a bait dog. 'I'm not sure why such a dog would have been used for dog baiting. He would be quite expensive to buy, which would suggest he may well have been bred for that or stolen. The bulldog-pug cross, pictured with vet Natasha Hillary at Kingston Veterinary Group, has  to wear bandages on all four of his legs . 'So far we have not had anybody come forward to claim Hero, but we've had plenty of phone calls to say they will home him. 'But we can't do that yet because we have to get him back to full health first. In the meantime we need to raise money to pay for the vet's bills, which will likely be in excess of £2, 000.' After he was taken to Kingston Vets in the city he was put on antibiotics and pain relief to help him recover, while his dressings are changed every day. Natasha Hillary, of Kingston Vets, where he was treated, said: 'When Hero came to us he had lacerations on all four of his legs. He also had an ulcer on his eye. 'It is quite early to tell how he will heal because one laceration is quite deep. He is walking so we expect him to do well. The hope for Hero in the future is that he will find a loving home. 'He's gorgeous and he craves human attention. It is possible that he was somebody's pet because of his breed but nobody has reported him missing and he is not micro chipped.' Ms Bryan added: 'Hero will have an operation at the end of this week. In cases such as this, the flesh is so badly damaged it starts to die off. This is why Hero will need his operation.' Staff at the centre in South Cave are now looking to find the puppy a loving home after his terrifying ordeal. She continued: 'Hero is very laid-back, even though he must be in horrific pain from his injuries. He is very gentle and I know everyone here has fallen in love with him. 'He was named Hero by the dog warden who picked him up because of how bad his injuries were. 'He will need someone that will be able to carry on his treatment, someone who has time to give him to look after him. He will need regular vet trips after everything he has gone through.'

"He wasn’t quite collecting signatures for the campaign to ‘Get Stuart Armstrong to Celtic’ but nor was Scott Brown of a mind to keep his bourgeoning respect for the player under a veil, either. The Dundee United midfielder, as Sportsmail revealed earlier this month, has an admirer in the shape of Celtic manager Ronny Deila. Recent personal checks by the Norwegian have confirmed a player blessed with pace, skill and bravery on the ball — everything he looks for in a midfielder, in fact. On Sunday at Tannadice, Armstrong’s credentials will be given another stern examination when Deila’s side look to extend their winning sequence in the Premiership to nine matches. Scott Brown feels the full force of a Stuart Armstrong tackle during a meeting last season . Whatever transpires, the contribution of the 22-year-old Invernessian could have significant ramifications for the transfer window which opens at the turn of the year. Certainly, if Deila seeks a second opinion from his skipper on Armstrong’s credentials before asking chief executive Peter Lawwell to pick up the phone, it would be a brave man to bet against the United star swelling the Scottish contingent at Lennoxtown in the near future. Asked if he felt Armstrong was good enough to cut it at Celtic, Brown replied: ‘I don’t see why not. I’ve seen his attributes when he’s been away with Scotland, too, and what he does. ‘He understands that you’ve got to show some respect but when he goes on the park he wants to win games as well. I love that about players. He works hard and wants to win games. You get disappointed if you don’t. He’s one of those lads. ‘It’s not really up to me who we sign but there are some great Scottish players out there. We signed Leigh (Griffiths) and Charlie (Mulgrew), while James (Forrest) has come through the youths as well. We are bringing in Scottish players as well.’ Armstrong is a player who can raise his game for the big occasion, and could cause Celtic problems . Pressed to expand upon what in particular impressed him about the man he will face on Sunday, Brown said: ‘He works hard and always wants the ball. That’s the main thing. Especially in Scotland, people can go hiding and don’t want it and don’t want to play in the big games. ‘He’s a big-game player and he always seems to do really well against us. He’s aggressive, strong and is direct as well. That’s what I like about him.’ Brown’s admiration stretches beyond just one individual at Tannadice. Almost two years since Jackie McNamara and Simon Donnelly left the Firhill dugout for Tayside, United fans have grown accustomed to a staple diet of entertaining, effective football. ‘Jackie and Simon have got them playing really good football,’ Brown added. ‘They get the ball down and try and play. ‘If you look around their squad they’ve got some great players — some talented young ones as well. ‘Armstrong is a great player, (Gary) Mackay-Steven and (Nadir) Ciftci up front as well. They always create chances, but it’s all about us on the day. If we turn up and play well, we should have too much for any team.’ United know to their cost that Brown is not merely mouthing off in that regard. Back in August, they descended on Celtic Park in optimistic mood but left humiliated after suffering a 6-1 drubbing. Just weeks into Deila’s regime, his Celtic players left the field to thunderous applause at half-time. Ronny Deila is an admirer of the Dundee United midfielder, and could try and sign him in January . Welcome though such an ovation was, the manager — in his heart of hearts — could have lived without it. Although he couldn’t admit it at the time, deep down he knew such an inspiring display was something of a freak occurrence. ‘Yeah, the worst thing of being a football manager is to let people down,’ he said of the indifferent games that followed. ‘That’s why it is so hard because you really want to make people happy. That’s the same for the players. ‘I wasn’t surprised that day. Dundee United attacked us and that opened up things for us. We also scored four goals from set-plays. I think if you go through goal chances we had eight and we scored six. So we were very effective. ‘The last four, five, six games we’ve had 10 to 15 chances in every game. So if you see behind the result, I think we’ve improved although we haven’t been so effective as we were in that United game. ‘In the transition we will go up and down. Now we have gone through six months with some good games and some bad games, but I’m very happy we are in all four tournaments now. We have gone through it in a good way and used the energy in the right way.’ Deila has had to learn quickly that quality time on the training ground with players is a luxury rarely afforded to Celtic managers. Celtic were superb as they thrashed Dundee United earlier in the season, and will hope for a repeat on Sunday . This week was the first since the campaign began that hadn’t been interrupted by a midweek match or international football. For a new manager striving to do things his way, such constant interruptions have been a source of deep frustration. ‘We need more of this,’ Deila stated. ‘It is hard to get the message across normally, so I have very much appreciated the opportunity this week. We’ve had three very good days on the training pitch and that’s been needed. ‘It is what the job is about for me. It’s getting there, but everything is a bit slower than what it would be if we would be able to train the team three days in a row every week, like I’m used to. ‘Here you have to do it in different ways. You have to use more video, more one-to-one talks and team talks. ‘But you also can’t do too much of that because you can tire the players out mentally. I think everybody’s understanding more where we want to go, how we want to play. ‘That excites me. I see so much potential.’ Brown (left) jokes with Anthony Stokes in training, as Celtic got a rare full week on the training pitches . It can safely be assumed that once the festive programme is completed at Kilmarnock on January 5, eight days at a winter training camp in Gran Canaria will be wisely spent. ‘It’s evolution, not revolution,’ Deila cautioned. ‘It’s not like I’m going to be able to show them in two training sessions everything in the world that I know and what I can do. ‘I believe you will (see the team improve), but it’s little by little. We’ll go more and more together. We’re working on the right things. There’s a good attitude in the group, a good mood. ‘That makes it also so much better.’ After Tannadice, Celtic entertain Ross County next Saturday before visits to Firhill and Rugby Park in the New Year. For Deila, who has spent the last few years holidaying in Brazil over Christmas, it’s a huge change. Not that he’d have it any other way, though. ‘Every game is like Christmas,’ he said. ‘Everything is new. My motivation is so high I just have to stagger myself so I don’t want too much. I am always holding back because you need to take it step by step and save your energy throughout the long season.’","Ronny Deila may try and sign Stuart Armstrong in January .

"Nigerian terror group Boko Haram is training child soldiers how to use semi-automatic weapons. The group has released pictures showing more than a dozen children posing with, and learning how to aim, AK-47's. The images appear to have been taken in northern Nigeria where Boko Haram has committed most of its attacks. Scroll down for video . Nigerian terror group Boko Haram is training child soldiers how to use semi-automatic weapons and has released images of their latest recruits armed with AK-47's . Human Rights Watch has previously warned that boys and girls kidnapped by the terrorist group were being used during their attacks . They were published online by Al Urwa al Wuthaqa, a media group that has been associated with the insurgents, and come months after Human Rights Watch warned that boys and girls kidnapped by the terrorist group were being used during their attacks. Just days ago Boko Haram were suspected of kidnapping at least 30 children, including girls as young as 11, in a village north of the country. A week earlier the terrorists snatched around 40 women in Adamawa State. In April the group came to international attention after it snatched 200 schoolgirls in the Chibok village and in January they killed at least 2,000 people, in Baga, Borno state. Following the mass killing, the Christian Association of Nigerians and Americans called for the UN to help Nigeria combat Boko Haram. It said the group had killed more than 10,000 people in 2014. In a statement it said: 'We are no longer certain what the world through the UN is waiting for before taking drastic actions. The images come just days after Boko Haram were suspected of kidnapping at least 30 children, including girls as young as 11, in a village north of the country; a week earlier the terrorists snatched around 40 women in Adamawa State; Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, is pictured above, delivering a message . Boko Haram were believed to have killed more than 10,000 people in 2014 alone and the Christian Association of Nigerians and Americans has called for the UN to help Nigeria fight the terrorists . 'The numbers are adding up fast and it is becoming clearer and clearer that the Nigerian governments both federal and states are failing resoundingly in their responsibility to protect innocent lives. Canan continues to be concerned about relief for the victims of terrorism in Nigeria.' Pastor Laolu Akande, the association's executive director, told the International Business Times that Boko Haram can only be defeated if the Nigerian military is backed up internationally. He said Nigeria had been trying to defeat the terrorist for four years, but 'Nigerian forces are too weak'. Pastor Akande said: 'It is time for international force of the calibre of the UN to deploy troops in that part of Nigeria. This has to be done and it cannot be ignored any more.' He said Nigerians deserved the same attention and support as the victim's of the Paris terrorist attacks earlier this month. 'It is important to understand that what is happening in Nigeria is a genocide, like the one occurred in Rwanda in 1994, and the world did not intervene to stop it. The UN has the responsibility to protect Nigeria. Boko Haram members are very despicable and brutal and every person in the world has to rise and say no to this violence.'","Terrorists were said to be kidnapping children to use during their attacks .

Mark said the contest is open to people from all backgrounds: ‘You could be a teenage mum in New York, a corporate lawyer in London or an unemployed graduate in Melbourne. ‘You could literally be anyone, from anywhere in the world. ‘You will all have one thing in common – a deep down belief that the life you are living now is a life that is standing in the shadows of the one that you know that you were created to live, and an undeterred passion to make that change. ‘The end for me is to create some ground-breaking projects and turn them into reality. My goal is to inspire people. And obviously it raises our profile as coaches.’ Former teacher Ali Walsh, a 35-year-old coeliac, applied for the opportunity because she wants to  expand her gluten-free cake business . To earn a spot on the island applicants must win over judges with an idea to make the world a better place, their personalities and  life stories . Mark said the hopefuls have submitted amazing stories and one of the biggest challenges will be paring down the list to six. One of the most memorable applications he has seen so far was from a ‘humanitarian clown’ from Australia who visits children's wards, hospitals and orphanages to inspire positivity. Former teacher Ali Walsh, a 35-year-old coeliac, applied for the opportunity because she wants to expand her gluten-free cake business, Bristol Bakehouse, across the country. She said: ‘As soon as I read about it, I knew I should apply - it's Fiji and it looks amazing. It would just be such a fantastic opportunity. I really want to make this work. ‘It's so lovely to be able to offer a child who can't eat gluten their first taste of a cake, or to be able to make a lovely wedding cake for a couple who are gluten-free. ‘I would plan to take everything they say and bring it back to Bristol and the country.

After attempting suicide in 2006 he woke up in hospital with ‘a profound realisation of how precious life is’. Just three months later he discovered Vorovoro and co-founded the eco-community Tribe Wanted. He and co-founder Ben Keene invited a group of strangers to escape the rat race and build an eco-community on the island, which was filmed for a BBC documentary, Paradise or Bust, in 2008. He said: ‘I am now giving six people an all-expenses paid opportunity to visit the same remote 200-acre island in Fiji. ‘They will be put through their paces by a life coach, a personal trainer and a business coach. Together we will ensure that their life will never be the same again.’","Life coach and former school cleaner Mark Bowness, from the Wirral, is renting Vorovoro with two  partners .

"Sydney and Melbourne have been named in the Top 10 safest cities in the world. The Economist’s Intelligence Unit has released a ranking of the safest major cities in the world, with Sydney finishing in sixth place and Melbourne in ninth. Japan’s capital city Tokyo topped the list followed by Singapore and Osaka in Japan. Business Insider Australia reported that the Economist’s Safe Index 2015 doesn’t simply measure crime, but rather has a wide-ranging view of safety. Sydney ranked in the top 10 for infrastructure. Hardly surprising when you've got the Sydney Opera House . The Economist’s ranking looked at 50 cities and chose them based on regional representation and availability of data. The cities were ranked on digital security, health security, infrastructure, and personal safety. With 4.5 million people, Sydney ranked in the top 10 for infrastructure, security and personal safety. However, it lagged behind in digital security and health security, in which it ranks 14th and 17th, respectively. The Yarra River area in Melbourne is 'a safe and healthy urban environment' to live in . However, Australia has some of the highest incidences of cybercrime in the world with Australians in the likes of Sydney now prime targets for internet fraud and identity thieves. Melbourne, with a population of 4 million has the second-safest infrastructure of the 50 cities ranked and ranks eighth in the category of personal safety. It also has one of the highest life expectancies of any city in the world at 86 years. As the report notes: ‘Living in a safe and healthy urban environment can make a real and measurable difference to city inhabitants.’ The thousands that flock to Bondi Beach in Sydney are in one of the safest places in the world . The report also found that it is the sixth-best city in the world to live in, when factors like safety and cost of living are taken into account. New York and Los Angeles lead in digital security, while Zurich takes the top spot for both health security and infrastructure safety. Each security section studied had its own requirements. Digital security measured the quality of a city’s cybersecurity, the frequency of identity theft, and other factors related to digital security. Places like Federation Square made Melbourne the second-safest infrastructure of the 50 cities ranked . Health security was a metric look at average life expectancy of a city’s citizens as well as the ratio of hospital beds to the size of the population. The Infrastructure section looked at factors like the quality of roads and the number of people who die from natural disasters. While personal safety was a category looking at more traditional safety measures like crime, the level of police engagement, and the number of violent crimes. The beauty of the likes of Southgate Complex on the Yarra River in Melbourne can make a 'real and measurable difference to city inhabitants', the report stated .","The Economist’s Intelligence Unit has released a ranking of the safest major cities in the world .

"The retired couple found dead after traveling to rural Georgia to buy a 1966 Ford Mustang through an advertisement placed on Craigslist, were well known for their charitable efforts all over the South. Elrey 'Bud' Runion and his wife, June, ran a charity called Bud's Bicycles which had helped people in need from storm-damaged Alabama towns and impoverished pockets of West Virginia to their hometown in suburban Atlanta. 'He said, ""You can't take money with you when you're gone,""' said the couple's daughter, Brittany Patterson. 'You might as well spend and enjoy it.' Scroll down for video . Elrey 'Bud' Runion and his wife, June, ran a charity called Bud's Bicycles which had helped people by providing not just bikes but also food, coats, blankets and even Thanksgiving turkeys . A man and his two daughters leave flowers by a child's bicycle that was left outside of the Runion's home as a tribute to the dead couple's charitable work on Tuesday. It was left standing below a flag flying at half-staff . This week, the couple's bodies were found, each shot in the head, in a small farming town in South Georgia. Bud Runion, 69, had driven nearly three hours from his Marietta home seeking to buy a piece of his youth, a replica of the 1966 Ford Mustang convertible he bought after returning from the Vietnam War decades ago. A potential seller responding to his Craigslist ad drew him to McRae on Thursday. On Monday, authorities found the couple's SUV, with their bodies nearby. Ronnie Adrian 'Jay' Towns, 28, of McRae, was charged on Tuesday with malice murder and armed robbery. A judge denied bond for Towns in his first, brief court appearance. Asked whether he understood what he had been charged with, Towns replied: 'I understand.' His attorney, public defender Ashley McLaughlin, declined to comment afterward. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said robbery appears to be the motive for the couple's killings, but he would not say whether the Runions were carrying cash or disclose other details about the case. Ronnie Adrian 'Jay' Towns, 28, of McRae, was charged on Tuesday with malice murder and armed robbery. A judge denied bond for Towns in his first, brief court appearance . On Monday, he said investigators had found no evidence that Towns owned the sort of classic car Runion was seeking. While the family was unsure on Tuesday morning what transpired in McRae, Patterson had her own assumptions. Her father served in Army's 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam, though he never talked to her about the experience in detail. 'He's a survivor and fighter, and I know he wouldn't have gone out without fighting and trying to protect my mother,' she said. Years ago, driving through Marietta before Christmas Eve, Runion saw two young girls sorting through a Dumpster, his daughter said. He fixed up two bicycles belonging to his own girls and delivered them as gifts. It was the beginning of 'Bud's Bicycles,' a charity run loosely out of Mount Paran Church of God in Marietta. Runion met his wife, a teacher, at the church in the 1970s. A message reading 'Bud and June' sits power washed in the driveway of the home of 69-year-old Elrey 'Bud' Runion and his 66-year-old wife, June, as an American flag flies at half-staff on Tuesday in Marietta . Neighbors said the Runions built a shed in their backyard to house the bikes. Their donations eventually expanded to include food, household and school supplies, coats, blankets — even Thanksgiving turkeys. 'Basically, he had a food pantry in the basement of their house,' Patterson said. Charity came in ways big and small. Patterson remembered as a child going to a doughnut shop with her father on Saturdays. They would often be joined by a man she did not know, and her father would pay the tab. Later in life she realized the man was homeless. In front of the couple's home Tuesday, someone tied flowers to a child's bicycle and left it standing below a flag flying at half-staff. 'If someone lives their life like this and this happens, it really tests your faith,' said their neighbor, Tom Murphy. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said robbery appears to be the motive for the couple's killings, but he would not say whether the Runions were carrying cash or disclose other details about the case . Vietnam vet R.C. Franden places an American flag by the mailbox belonging to fellow vet and neighbor Elrey 'Bud' Runion. 'He was a heck of a guy, just salt of the earth,' said Franden. 'It's horrible, he didn't deserve it' In McRae, the Runions' slaying shocked residents. In the tiny city about 80 miles southeast of Macon, a public mural in the downtown square proclaims it's the '6th Safest City in Georgia.' The suspect, Towns, grew up on a farm down a long dirt road where his father raised pine trees and grew soybeans, corn and peanuts. Now 28, he had a family of his own — a wife and a young daughter — in neighboring Wheeler County. Towns supported them by working construction jobs for a local homebuilder, said his uncle, Buddy Towns. 'He's a good kid and very smart,' said the uncle, who sometimes hired his nephew to help install carpet and flooring customers had purchased from Buddy Towns' business in McRae. Buddy Towns said it had been six months or so since he needed his nephew's help on a job, but he saw the younger Towns' truck pass his storefront almost daily as he headed to work. He said his nephew remained close to his father, Ronnie Towns Sr., and they often went fishing and hunting together. Towns' family helped persuade him to turn himself in to authorities Monday. Buddy Towns said they were stunned that he would be charged in connection with the Runions' disappearance. 'It just doesn't make any sense why this would even go down,' Towns' uncle said. 'It's hard for his parents. They're not understanding.'

"Greece's radical new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has vowed the country will no longer 'blindly submit' to the EU as he pledged to ditch austerity and negotiate a better deal for the country. Tsipras used his first cabinet speech  to take a  swipe at Brussels and the International Monetary Fund by warning that Greece's new leaders were no longer willing to bow to the 'politics of submission'. The 40-year-old premier said the country will not default on its debts but that his priority would be to help create a 'viable, mutually beneficial solution' to the 'humanitarian disaster' he claimed his country has suffered as a result of the austerity imposed by it creditors. Scroll down for video . Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras smiles during the first meeting of new cabinet post elections in the parliament building in Athens where he said he would restore national sovereignty but pledged to negotiate responsibly with international creditors . His left-wing party Syriza stormed to power in Greece with 36 per cent of the vote with their promise to ditch austerity and renegotiate the country's €240bn (£180bn; $270bn) bailout. Greece had agreed to implement tough budget cuts after it accepted a 2010 bailout from the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. But the programme of austerity has proved extremely unpopular in Greece and Tsipras 'defend the dignity' of its people. The new government's radical anti-austerity agenda has alarmed financial markets, reviving fears that Greece could crash out of the eurozone. Greek stocks fell 6 percent in midday trade - after losing 3 percent the previous day - and yields on 10-year bonds also rose above the symbolic barrier of 10 percent. And in another move that spooked markets, the government halted the privatisation of Greece's main port, Piraeus, which Chinese shipping giant Cosco had planned to turn into its new European hub. After his Syriza party stormed to power on Sunday, Tsipras forged a coalition with the nationalist Independent Greeks (ANEL), who are equally opposed to the fiscal cuts imposed over the past five years in return for bailout loans. Mr Tsipras and members of the new Greek government pose outside the Parliament after the Prime Minister's address in the first meeting of his cabinet . In his first speech to cabinet, the new Prime Minister sent a double message, one to the lenders - that the new government does not want things to be taken to a 'mutually destructive rupture' but at the same time it will not concede to submission - and a second one to a domestic audience that it will decisively deal with the establishment of the past decades and corruption . In a sign that the new government will take a hard line in haggling over the 240-billion-euro package, Tsipras named leftwing economist Yanis Varoufakis as finance minister. A fierce critic of the conditions imposed by creditors, Varoufakis argues the country's shattered economy will never recover until they are relaxed. The new ruling coalition - who together have 162 seats in the 300-member parliament - must address an end-of-February deadline set by the EU for Greece to carry out more reforms in return for a seven-billion-euro tranche of financial aid from the bloc and the IMF. Tsipras, who has vowed to reverse many of the severe spending cuts and other measures that Greece's creditors insist on, must soon decide whether to delay the deadline. Greece's European partners have been quick to stymie the prospect of debt forgiveness, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman saying that Greek membership of the eurozone 'means... sticking to its previous commitments.' However the EU's governing body indicated Wednesday that it was willing to show flexibility with the new Greek leaders to keep the debt-stricken nation in the eurozone. The European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, France's Pierre Moscovici, said he ruled out any 'break' between the European Commission and the new Greek administration, the French daily Le Parisien reported Wednesday. The Commission and the European Union are willing to seek 'less intrusive, more flexible forms of cooperation' with Athens, the paper quoted him as saying. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis attends the first meeting in the parliament building in Athens where Mr Tsipras told ministers  voters had given them a mandate for radical change . 'What we all want is that Greece recovers, creating growth and jobs, that it reduces inequality, that it can deal with the problem of its debt and remains in the euro area,' he said. The head of the eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, will visit Athens on Friday 'to get to know' Greece's new leaders, his spokeswoman said. But in a newspaper interview Wednesday, a member of Germany's Bundesbank central bank warned Athens of 'fatal consequences' if it rejected the bailout terms. 'If the continuation of the programme of aid for Greece is called into question... Greek banks would lose access to central bank funds,' Joachim Nagel told the German business daily Handelsblatt. 'It would have fatal consequences for the Greek financial system.' Tsipras' Syriza party claims the stringent conditions attached to the bailout - including wage and pension cuts and widespread privatisations - have caused a 'humanitarian disaster' in Greece. It wants to spend 1.2 billion euros to immediately increase the minimum wage and pensions for the poorest. However, the IMF extended an olive branch to the new government, saying it was prepared to continue its support to the country. Greece's economy is set to emerge from recession after shrinking by a quarter in five years, a slump that has left one in four out of work. Many Greeks say that even if Tsipras can deliver on a fraction of what he has promised, their lives will improve. Tsipras stands alone as Europe's first anti-austerity leader for the moment, but Syriza's victory could inspire other movements born out of the crisis, including Spain's Podemos, which is aiming for an absolute majority in the Spanish election in November.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned residents to 'reconcile yourselves with your God' because the 'furious hoarfrost bearing down upon us knows neither mercy or reason'. The Mayor was poking fun at his over-reaction to the east coast winter storm Juno warnings by reading a article from the satirical newspaper The Onion. In the story, de Blasio warns New Yorkers about the killer storm, but in reality less than 10 inches of snow fell in the city. Scroll down for video . Reality: Despite poking fun at himself, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had to defend his unprecedented, stringent restrictions in the face of the storm, which brought less than 10 inches of snow . Poking fun: de Blasio (centre) entertained reporters at Tuesday's press conference with his reading of The Onion article . The Mayor entertained reporters in City Hall on Tuesday by giving a dramatic reading of the 150-word story which included instructions to 'clutch your babes close to your breast' before the storm arrives. 'All shall meet their death in the coming tempest,' de Blasio said, reading from the satirical piece. Although the Mayor took the opportunity to make fun of the situation, he and Governor Andrew Cuomo staunchly defended their unprecedented, stringent restrictions on city residents in the lead up to the storm. Both said that they believed in erring on the side of caution and suggested they would take such measures again if presented with a similar situation. 'Would you rather be ahead of the action or behind?' de Blasio asked City Hall. 'Would you rather be prepared or unprepared? Would you rather be safe or unsafe? 'To me it was a no-brainer: we had to take precautions to keep people safe.' Before the heavy snows  reached New York, officials closed schools, shut down bridges and tunnels, canceled commuter rail services and, for the first time  in a snowstorm, closed the city's sprawling subway system at 11pm on Monday. A travel ban was put in place and drivers caught out on the roads faced arrest. Restrictions: Officials closed schools, shut down bridges and tunnels, canceled commuter rail services and, for the first time in a snowstorm, closed the city's sprawling subway system at 11pm on Monday . 'To me it was a no-brainer: we had to take precautions to keep people safe,' explained the New York City Mayor . However, the meteorologists whose forecasts prompted the action this week were wrong and the storm, while powerful on Long Island and in New England, dropped less than a foot of snow on the city. National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini said his agency should have done a better job of communicating the uncertainty in its forecast. National Weather Service forecaster Gary Szatkowski tweeted an apology: 'You made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right, and we didn't.' The decision to lock down the city - particularly closing the subways - drew significant criticism from some business owners and transit advocacy groups. For de Blasio and Cuomo, however, mistakes made during previous storms likely guided their decisions. In 2010, New York City was unprepared for a blizzard and then-mayor Michael Bloomberg was out of town. The storm resulted in miles of unplowed roads, stranded ambulances and angry residents stuck in their homes for days. Defence: Governor Andrew Cuomo (pictured) said his decision to act aggressively stems from the historic storm that covered Buffalo with seven feet of snow last year . Weather forecast: The meteorologists whose forecasts prompted the action this week were wrong . After that debacle, Bloomberg held a series of press conferences before, during, and after expected storms. In these events, the mayor, flanked by his commissioners, delivered an avalanche of statistics to reassure residents of the city's readiness for the approaching snowstorm. There were no reported fatalities in New York in the latest storm. The city did, however, lose about $200 million in economic activity due to the  decision to shut down the transit system, according to a preliminary estimate from Moody's Analytics. Cuomo acknowledged that his decision to act aggressively stems from the historic storm that blanketed Buffalo with seven feet of snow late last year. 'We make big decisions based on these weather forecasts,' the governor said. 'We decided not to close the roads in Buffalo... and we had people stranded on the roads for 12, 15, 20 hours. You can have a significant loss of life in these situations.' To the north of New York in Boston, residents were savaged by a blizzard packing knee-high snowfall and hurricane-force wind.","New York City Mayor warned people to 'reconcile yourselves with God'

Drive-thru proposal: Christian Breier, 31, from Leipzig, proposed to his partner Anja, 29, by getting caught speeding by a police camera . Mr Breier's says he had broached the subject of marriage with his partner Anja, 29, who had told him that if he wanted to propose he had to 'think of a cool way of proposing,' the couple told Bild newspaper. Mr Breier, a graphic designer, said: 'I kept turning it over in my mind and eventually came up with the idea of getting the message delivered by police. 'In Germany, the police routinely send a photograph of the driver together with a speeding notice, to prove who was at the wheel at the time of the offence. 'All I needed to do was hold something with the message so when she went off to a brunch with friends I drove off in our Volkswagen. 'Getting a speeding ticket isn't as easy as you think. It took me five times until I actually saw the camera flash.' Big ask: Mr Breier was snapped by a speeding camera holding up a banner reading: 'Willst du mich heiraten?', meaning 'Will you marry me?' When Anja, who did not give the paper her last name, opened the envelope on Christmas Day, she found the picture of her boyfriend holding the banner reading: 'Willst du mich heiraten?' - 'Will you marry me?' Anja said: 'After I'd read it I looked up and saw Christian down on one knee holding out the ring. And of course I said yes.' Mr Breier told the magazine that he had to drive with precision to avoid a hefty fine under Germany's staggered penalty system. If a driver stays within 10 km/h (6mph) of the speed limit, the offense results in a 15 Euro fine (£11) and no points. However, when a driver goes 25km/h (15mph) over the limit, it results in an 80 Eurp (£60) fine and one  point on his licence. Although Mr Breier was fined £11, he said it was 'most definitely worth it, after all, she said yes and that is priceless'.","German man proposes by getting caught on a speed camera .

"GoDaddy pulled the plug on its Super Bowl commercial starring Buddy the golden retriever puppy Tuesday evening after getting an earful from furious animal rights activists. The domain name company released the ad Tuesday - five days before it will be viewed by more than 100million people during the Patriots and Seahawks game - and it was roundly criticized for apparently making light of puppy mills. The advert opens with the nine-week-old pooch riding in the back of a truck, as it parodies Budweiser's commercials featuring a dog and its Clydesdale horses. But instead of enjoying the view, Buddy is thrown from the bed of the truck and he faces a treacherous journey home across train tracks and bridges and through mud and rain. Don't be fooled: GoDaddy's 2015 Super Bowl advert, which was revealed on Tuesday, opens with Buddy the puppy looking out from the bed of a truck - but it soon takes a dark turn . Plot twist: The truck hits a rock and the golden retriever puppy is thrown from the back of the truck . Finally, he sees his owners' farm and runs towards them, as they open their arms in joy. But it's no happy ending: the only reason they're glad to seem him is because they've sold him on a website they set up with the help of GoDaddy. The pup is promptly put in a van and driven away by GoDaddy spokesperson and racing star Danica Patrick. Viewers of the video have responded with shock and disgust. 'Poking fun at a puppy mill is not a laughing matter,' wrote Mick Magnuson. 'And I hope they get bombarded with calls and emails letting them know how disgusting the commercial is.' 'What kind of monster do they have running their marketing department? #GoDaddyPuppy Tasteless, horrid, shameful,' Kate Thomas tweeted. Message received: It did not take GoDaddy long to do an about-face in response to an avalanche of vitriol . GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving posted a statement  addressing the firestorm swirling around the Buddy ad . Some customers even messaged the domain service to say they would no longer be registering websites with them again. It did not take GoDaddy long to do an about-face in a bid to be back in the good graces of their customers and the public at large. At around 7pm Eastern Time, the company sent out a tweet reassuring their critics that their message was heard 'loud and clear,' and that GoDaddy is changing course on the ad. GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving posted a statement on the company's blog addressing the firestorm swirling around the Buddy ad, saying that its goal was to 'increase awareness' of the company's commitment to helping small businesses build an online presence. 'However, we underestimated the emotional response,' Irving conceded. The CEO added that his company still plans to run a commercial during the Super Bowl that would make fans laugh, but he did not elaborate on its content. According to TMZ, the domain name giant shelled out $4million for its 30-second slot in the lineup. Irving concluded his 'mea culpa' titled, 'We're Listening, Message Received,' by reassuring animal rights activists that Buddy the dog came to GoDaddy from a 'reputable and loving' breeder in California, and that he is now part of the 'GoDaddy family' as the company's 'Chief Companion Officer.' A petition created on Change.org demanding that GoDaddy pull the Buddy ad has drawn more than 42,000 signatures as of Tuesday night. On track: Buddy, who was nine-weeks-old when they shot the commercial, tries to find his way home . Treacherous: In other scenes, he cowers in the cold as he tries to get back to his family's farm . When the now-scrapped TV spot was unveiled on the Today show Tuesday morning, the hosts were shocked. 'Me no likey,' Natalie Morales said as her co-hosts sat in silence. Savannah Gurthie added: 'I don't know how people are going to feel about that.' 'Oh, I know how they're going to feel about it,' Matt Lauer said. But some saw the funny side. 'My first thought was, this isn't funny, but it got so weird I couldn't not laugh! Funny commercial,' Darren McPhee wrote on Twitter. In a statement to AdWeek Tuesday evening, PETA Director Colleen O’Brien praised GoDaddy for yanking the ad. 'GoDaddy did the right thing by swiftly promoting adoption. PETA’s message is that when you buy a dog from a pet store or a breeder, a dog in an animal shelter dies,' said O'Brien. Last year, GoDaddy's commercial featured a woman who quit her job so she could work as a puppeteer full time. Reunited: But when Buddy finally makes his way back home, his owners have some unexpected news . Bye, Buddy! The pup has been sold via a website they set up with the help of GoDaddy . Heartbreaking: Buddy is driven away by GoDaddy spokesperson Danica Patrick to his new home . In 2013, the company's advert featured model Bar Refaeli kissing a geeky actor, to show how the domain-name registrar mixes smart and sexy. Ahead of this year's reveal, Gerry Graf of Barton F. Graf 9000, the advertising company behind the ad, had told AdWeek they would be 'playing with Super Bowl clichés'. 'There seems to be five puppy ads every year,' he said 'So, we're going to go hang out and play in that area.' But he warned: 'It's not going to be sappy.' Anger: Viewers took to Twitter to complain about the advert. The company said it was parodying other Super Bowl adverts featuring puppies - but viewers said there was nothing funny about puppy mills . Annoyed: Laura Nativo, a pet trainer and host, also vented her anger on Twitter on Tuesday .","GoDaddy released its 2015 Super Bowl commercial starring Buddy the golden retriever Tuesday .

"Fans of the new BBC series Wolf Hall, which is based on the rise of Thomas Cromwell from lowly blacksmith's son to Henry VIII's chief minister, have been drooling over the beautiful gowns, shining jewels and awe-inspiring architecture of Tudor times. But don't be fooled by the glamour - life in Tudor times  was tough for women (even if you weren't one of Henry's wives on her way out of favour). During the 16th century, it was illegal for women to take on many jobs, they were considered the property of men and it was considered reasonable for a husband to beat his wife. Scroll down for video . Wolf Hall (Anne Boleyn and her ladies-in-waiting, pictured) has us salivating over beautiful clothes, architecture and jewellery but life was tough in Tudor times for the court ladies  and poorer women . On top of this, education was considered unnecessary for girls, meaning women were often illiterate for most of their lives. Women's main role in society was giving birth, which was an extremely dangerous process in the 1500s and often resulted in death. Even small things like getting dressed in the morning was an arduous task, with layers and layers of clothing needed to conform to social standards. And after jumping through all of these hoops, women were given little thanks, with their male counterparts seeing them as evil temptresses who had led to the fall of man. FEMAIL's guide to life for women during the reign of Henry VIII: . Anne Boleyn (played by Claire Foy) was one of England's most powerful women after marrying Henry VIII (above, Damian Lewis) but she was still beholden to him and the men in her family . Tudor sex . Sex in Tudor times wasn't supposed to be fun, especially for women. The church dictated many of the rules of the time - they said that sex was solely for procreation purposes and only ever between husband and wife. Not only that, but missionary sex was the only position allowed, because other styles were thought to let the devil into the bedroom and lead to a deformed child. According to historians, a married couple were also forbidden from having sex on Tuesdays, Fridays, Sundays and during Lent. It wasn't all bad though, there was a movement that declared a woman needed to ejaculate too in order for conception to be successful during sex, so emphasis was placed on women being able to orgasm. However, even where orgasms were involved, women were not allowed to admit to gaining any pleasure from it. Unsurprisingly, contraception wasn't easy during the 16th century, both because of laws and a lack of any scientific knowledge. Although birth control was illegal, there were several methods used to stop pregnancy. According to the historical novelist Elizabeth Fremantle, wealthy men used condoms made from lamb's gut, while women would insert either vinegar-soaked wool or pieces of wood into their vagina as a Medieval-style diaphragm. Katherine Of Aragon (played by Joanne Whalley) had very few rights after Henry VIII divorced her . Women's rights . In Tudor times, women had no legal rights and the law was used by men to limit all aspects of their freedom. It was illegal for women to have professional jobs in the law or teaching, or as doctors, which had the added effect of making them seem like a financial burden on a family. In the 16th century, women were owned by their father until they were married, when they then became the property of their husband. While they could inherit property, it was immediately passed over to their husbands if they married. Very few women would have rallied against any of these restrictions as they were taught from a very young age that men were the superior sex. The only women who were seen of any use to the world were those who had given birth or were pregnant, as that was considered their only function in life. Anne's sister Mary (played by Charity Wakefield) was badly used by the men in her family, who were rumoured to have offered her to the king to keep him entertained  while her sister was pregnant . According to the historian Elizabeth Fremantle, men were also legally allowed to beat their wives. She told Express.co.uk: 'If a husband disliked his wife’s behaviour he was permitted to beat her with a stick no broader than his thumb but not so violently as to kill her. 'If a wife was deemed a nag she might be paraded about in public wearing an iron bridle, complete with a tongue-piece, to make speech impossible and humiliation certain.' Education . As women weren't allowed jobs, there was little need for a girl to be educated at school, which meant they were often illiterate for their whole lives. Poor girls were usually put to use around the house doing menial chores from a very young age, but some richer families would hire a governess to teach skills that were considered feminine, like embroidery. In contrast, boys would be taught academic subjects like reading, writing and maths. Anne Boleyn was unusual in that she was well educated and spoke French fluently as well as English . Childbirth . Giving birth was extremely dangerous in the 16th century, because of a lack of modern medicine and sterilised equipment. Women often died during labour from complications that, today, would be easily overcome. One of the most common was puerperal fever, a septic infection that killed both Jane Seymour and Katherine Parr - two of Henry's wives. As well as being dangerous, childbirth was also extremely painful because pain relief was illegal. According to the historian Amy Licence, who wrote In Bed With The Tudors, one midwife was actually burned for using opium to help ease the pain of labours in 1591. Dark blue and black were both colours worn by very rich men and women in the 16th century . Clothing . Getting dressed was an arduous affair in Tudor times. Rich women wore several layers of ruffs, skirts and large amounts of padding under their gowns to achieve the fashionable boxy silhouette of the time. Poorer women wore much simpler linen dresses with short sleeves. Every woman wore their hair tied up under a cap. While the Tudors were very relaxed about their bathing habits, their attitudes to cleanliness in their clothing was very different. Whether rich or poor, every man and woman wore clean linens every day and the upper classes would sometimes change up to several times a day. The rich didn't just restrict themselves to linen either - new trade with Europe had opened up vast new areas of fashion, with different dyes and materials including silk, taffeta and damasks. Married women hid their hair under a veil or cap, but the queen could wear it loose as she wore a crown . But while there were plenty of new fabric colours to choose from, certain parts of society were only allowed to wear certain shades. New laws were passed during the Tudor era that dictated what colour you could wear according to your class, so that it was clear how important you were. Purple was solely for royalty, black for extremely wealthy men and women, while yellow, russet and green was worn by the lower classes. For all these different restrictions on clothing, the one thing the Tudor's weren't fussy about was underwear - women wore no pants, so they could easily go to the toilet. Women who were not married were allowed to wear their hair loose, but as soon as you were married, it had to be tied away under a hood. The queen would occasionally be allowed to wear her hair loose because she wore a crown. Life was tough for poor women as they were expected to run the entire household with no thanks . Housework . Women in Tudor times were extremely busy around the house. The basic chores that still apply for adults today, including cooking, washing clothes, cleaning and accounts were far more difficult without modern technology. But also, they were tasked with baking bread and brewing beer, as well as preserving fruits, pickling vegetables and curing meats because of the lack of refrigeration that keeps food from going off. She was also responsible for making soap and candles, spinning wool and linen and growing vegetables and herbs.","BBC's  Wolf Hall has us salivating over beautiful clothes and jewellery .

"A retired US Marine-turned-security contractor has been named as the American victim in an attack on a luxury hotel in Libya that left five foreigners dead. Cliff Taylor of Crucible LLC of Fredericksburg, Virginia, identified the worker as David Berry. He declined to release any additional information on Berry, citing security concerns. In a statement, Taylor said Berry was a contractor with Crucible. Scroll own for video . Slain hero: Retired US Marine-turned security contractor David Berry, 34, has been identified as the American victim in an attack on a luxury hotel in Libya that left five foreigners dead . 'Today our company was a victim of a terrorist attack. Our company mourns this extraordinary loss with his family and friends,' the statement read. Taylor said the company was still gathering details on the death of Berry, who was among five foreigners killed Tuesday when a gunman stormed Corinthia Hotel in the Libyan capital. A senior US State Department official confirmed the death of one American, but provided no details. Taylor said Crucible employs less than 100 people . According to his LinkedIn page, Berry was a 12-year combat veteran with the US Marine Corps with extensive experience in special operations and intelligence. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Berry's father, James Berry, said his 34-year-old son was a native of Arizona who was fluent in Arabic. 'My son is a warrior, he always wanted to do what he’s doing right now, or what he did up to this day,' Mr. Berry said. 'He was a man who had more respect and honor for this country than you would believe.' He was hired by Crucible only seven months ago, first as a site security manager in Libya and most recently as project security manager. A total of five guards and four foreigners were killed when gunmen stormed the high-end hotel in Tripoli, triggering an hours-long standoff. The attack on the Corinthia Hotel, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea, underscores Libya's lawlessness since the Western-backed campaign to overthrow and kill Muammar Gaddafi. Libyan militants sympathetic to the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. Alleged members of a group called the Islamic State of the Tripoli Province posted a brief video showing burned cars in the hotel's parking lot and said it was to avenge the 2013 abduction by American commandos of a Libyan al-Qaida operative, Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, also known as Abu Anas al-Libi. Al-Ruqai died earlier this month in a New York hospital of complications from liver surgery while awaiting trial for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Security forces check a screenshot of one of the suspected terrorists inside Corinthia Hotel . The attack started in the morning and included a car bombing, said Essam al-Naas, a spokesman for a Tripoli security agency. Libya's security forces responded and after several hours of a stand-off, the attackers threw a grenade at the security forces, killing themselves and a security guard. Ten people were also wounded in the attack, including security guards and guests. 'The operation is over,' Mr al-Naas said, but added that the streets around Corinthia remained closed. He said an investigation was under way. Earlier in the day, Mahmoud Hamza, commander of the Special Deterrent Force, told private satellite television station al-Nabaa that five foreigners were killed, without elaborating, but Mr al-Naas later revised the casualty toll. It was not clear if the two assailants were the only ones involved in the attack, earlier reports claimed one militant had been arrested. As the standoff developed, a security official said the gunmen had taken hostages, though he had no further details. Two commercial landmark towers behind the hotel were evacuated out of security concerns, he said. A member of staff in the hotel said the attack began when five masked gunmen wearing bulletproof vests stormed the hotel after security guards at the hotel's gate tried to stop them. He said they entered the hotel and fired randomly at the staff in the lobby. The staffer said the gunmen fired in his direction when he opened his door to look out. He said he joined the rest of the staff and foreign guests fleeing out the hotel's back doors into the parking lot. When they got there, he said a car bomb exploded in the parking lot, only a hundred meters away. He said this came after a protection force entered the lobby and opened fire on the attackers. He said two guards were immediately killed. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared being targeted later by militants. He said the car bomb left at least five cars in the parking lot burned and damaged some windows in the hotel's facade. He said the hotel had Italian, British and Turkish guests, but it was largely empty at the time of the attack. He said the militia-backed Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi usually resides at the hotel, but was not there Tuesday. Al-Hassi's security guards also weren't there, he said. The hotel previously came under attack in 2013 when a former prime minister was abducted there. EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya' In a brief statement on Twitter, the Tripoli branch of Isis claimed to have stormed the hotel . EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya'. She expressed 'solidarity with the victims and their families' but provided no details of casualties. 'Such attacks should not be allowed to undermine the political process,' Ms Mogherini said in a statement. A spokesman for the Malta-based Corinthia Hotel chain, Matthew Dixon, told AFP by telephone: 'Our thoughts are with our staff and guests. We have no further information.' Since Gaddafi's ousting, Libya has been torn among competing militias and tribes vying for power. The Islamist-backed Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) militia alliance took control of Tripoli last summer, forcing the country's internationally recognised government to flee to the far east. The militia-backed government in Tripoli said the target of the attack was Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi. Spokesman Amr Baiou told reporters Mr al-Hassi was unharmed.

"Terrie Sena, 43, agreed to a deal that will put her behind bars for 10 years to life . A woman accused of taking part in underage incestuous video-taped sex attacks alongside her ex-husband and his second wife is to plead guilty. Terrie Sena, 43, agreed to a deal Tuesday with Clark County prosecutors that could put her behind bars for 10 years to life. Terrie, her ex-husband Christopher Sena, 47, and his wife, Deborah Sena, 50,  who all lived together in a trailer in Las Vegas, are accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years. Terrie Sena is to plead guilty to one count of sexual assault, reports Review Journal. Debra Sena has been offered the same deal, but her attorney says she is a victim and her husband make her take part. 'She was coerced, threatened, blackmailed, beaten, by Chris Sena,' defense attorney Kristina Wildeveld said. 'I'm very uncomfortable with a victim of domestic violence signing up for 10 to life in prison for something that she never was an active participant in,' defense attorney Kristina Wildeveld said. 'She was coerced to do any and all that she is charged with, and that is very troubling.' Some victims were relatives, while Christopher Sena also encouraged his children to bring their friends over to the house so that he could abuse them, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. He allegedly told one girl and one male victim to 'bring female friends over' and to make sure they wore bathing suits, according to the police report. Christopher Sena, 47, (left) and his wife, Deborah Sena, 50, (right) who all lived together in a trailer in Las Vegas, are accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years . Another female victim, who is now an adult, said she saw Christopher Sena take 'a number of her friends' into his office, police said. One woman who says she was sexually abused told investigators that she believes her high school friends were assaulted by Sena. Neighbors told the Review-Journal that he would seem 'excited' when his sons brought girlfriends over to the house. Others described the Sena property as the place many neighborhood kids would hang out. Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, they said. To stop his victims from speaking out about the abuse, he told at least two of them that he would kill them or break their legs if they spoke out, they told police. Christopher Sena was arrested in September when Deborah, who recently split from him, another woman and a child told a family attorney about the alleged abuse. The attorney went to police, as is required by law, and a SWAT team stormed the house on September 18 to arrest Sena and seize his recording equipment. Scene: After his wife told a lawyer about the abuse, Christopher Sena was arrested at their home (pictured) in September. Officers seized electronic equipment and allegedly found videos of the abuse . Authorities allegedly found videos showing all three adults engaging in sex acts with children, which led to the arrests of Deborah Sena and Terrie Sena last week. At least eight minors were involved and some encounters were filmed as part of a child porn operation, police said. One alleged victim told authorities that when Sena started abusing her as a child, the two women were not aware of it, but when she was 17, she was forced to engage in sexual activity with them. That victim started to strike her stomach with a piece of wood, fearful that he would fall pregnant with Sena's child, police said. Some of the victims say they were abused for years; one boy said the abuse started when he was three and continued until he was a teen, while another woman said she was abused two or three times a week by Sena for more than a decade. But according to police, who called it 'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory', he was not the only one carrying out the abuse. His ex, Terrie Sena, told police she was attracted to young male and female teens, and said it was 'really enjoyable' when one of the boys started to look like Christopher Sena. But she told authorities that she later felt 'ashamed' and 'dirty'. Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997. But after they split, Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife. Authorities also allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband in August, involved in sexual acts with the family dog. Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher (pictured together in an old photo), whom she split from in August . Deborah says her husband said that, if she loved him, she would do what he wanted her to do . She claims her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him. One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two Sena children having sex with the family dog, The Daily Beast reported. Christopher Sena is facing 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison. The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest. All three have been held without bail.","Terrie Sena, 43, agreed to a deal Tuesday with Clark County prosecutors that could put her behind bars for 10 years to life .

"Tesco's has recalled its No Added Sugar Double Concentrate Apple and Blackcurrent juice amid claims that it has caused vomiting and diarrhea and contained 'foreign bodies' Tesco's has recalled a popular children's fruit drink amid claims that it has caused vomiting and diarrhea and contained 'foreign bodies'. The troubled chain has stopped selling its No Added Sugar Double Concentrate Apple and Blackcurrent juice in both the 750ml and 1.5l. Talk about the recall on the HotUKDeals website led to parenting website Playpennies making their own inquiries, 'to ease the worries of our audience and other parents', site manager Karen McGinn said. According to the website it called Tesco's customer service line where the company 'refused to confirm reports appearing online from parents that the juice has been causing vomiting'. Playpennies told its users: 'They would only confirm that foreign bodies have been found in some batches, which along with an unusual smell have led to all returned bottles being sent to laboratories as soon as possible to try and identify any potential issues and the batches that may be affected.' The remarks on their website caused a flurry of comments from their users. Several users had noticed the drink had not smelt right, while others said they felt sick after drinking it. Tesco's confirmed the chain had received complaints which it is now 'investigating with the supplier'; a spokesperson said the products had been withdrawn from sale and advised any customer not 'satisfied' with the product to return it to any store .

It announced its annual profits may be £550 million lower than expected. The Serious Fraud Office is investigating whether it inflated profits by £263m over several years. The company suspended eight of its most senior executives amid the allegations. Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent stepped down. Millions of customers have switched to budget rivals like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer because Tesco has failed to deliver on price, service or quality.

"One of the biggest concerns about smart household gadgets is how much data they collect and share about you and your home. And, with this in mind, a US government consumer watchdog has laid out guidelines that call for increased privacy and security across connected devices, for fitness, smart homes and other uses. At the moment, the guidelines are only suggestions and 'best practices' that companies are encouraged to follow, but the agency did call on Congress to consider legislation to cover such data security. The guidelines were announced by Federal Trade Commission chairwoman Edith Ramirez at the State of the Net conference in Washington (pictured). These guidelines call for increased privacy and security across connected devices, but are currently only suggestions and 'best practices' firms are encouraged to follow .

'Not only is deeply personal information at stake but as you have more and more devices it means there is more potential for exposure,' she told attendees. 'If you want these new technologies to flourish, you want to make sure consumers understand what is happening, understand what is being collected, with whom that information is being shared, how this information is being used.'

IoT includes gadgets bought by consumers, as well as products and services designed for businesses to help machines ‘communicate’ with each other. For example, the term IoT can include the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags businesses place on products in stores to track their inventory, or sensors that monitor electricity use in hotels. For the purposes of the report, the FTC uses the term IoT to refer to devices or sensors - other than computers, smartphones, or tablets - that connect, communicate or transmit information over the web. It is limited to the gadgets sold to, or used by, consumers. As part of the report, the FTC recommends a number of actions. These include building security into devices at the outset, training employees about the importance of security, adding measures to stop unauthorised people accessing the device or network, and monitoring connected devices and providing security updates as soon as risks are identified. Last year, the FTC studied 12 mobile fitness apps and found they shared data with 76 separate entities. Ms Ramirez continued: 'If I'm wearing a fitness band that tracks how many calories I consume I wouldn't want to share that data with an insurance company.' The FTC report made no specific legislative recommendation for IoT but said 'there appeared to be widespread agreement that companies developing IoT products should implement reasonable security.' The report added: ‘The Commission recognises this industry is in its relatively early stages [and] does not believe that the privacy and security risks, though real, need to be addressed through IoT-specific legislation at this time. ‘However, while IoT specific-legislation is not needed, Congress should enact general data security legislation.’ This interactive image shows how Internet of Things devices  can be used in a 'connected' living room - and other rooms in a smart house. These gadgets are connected using AllJoyn, set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011. The software can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn . The guidelines would apply to the billions of devices that connect to the internet including cars, fridges, toothbrushes, fitness trackers, locks, security systems, and more. But TechFreedom president Berin Szoka said :'At best, this is just another exercise in workshop theatre; at worst, the FTC is trying to regulate the Internet of Things by stealth.' The report concluded: 'The IoT presents numerous benefits to consumers, and has the potential to change the ways that consumers interact with technology in fundamental ways. 'In the future, the Internet of Things is likely to meld the virtual and physical worlds together in ways that are currently difficult to comprehend. To mark Data Privacy Day, a study from internet and mobile security company BullGuard found that 41% of people post content about others online . Today is Data Privacy Day - an international effort focusing on: 'Respecting Privacy, Safeguarding Data and Enabling Trust.' It is dedicated to helping people better understand how to protect personal information online. Commenting on the campaign, Richard Anstey, chief technical officer for EMEA at Intralinks told MailOnline: 'When dealing with very sensitive information, people need to know about very secure measures, such as information rights management. 'Security is about knowing what the danger is and how to deploy the appropriate level of protection. 'If we want a truly data-secure society we need to start by ensuring people know what value their data has, then they can make informed decision about how to secure it.' Jason Hart, vice president of cloud services, identity and data Protection at data security firm Gemalto added: 'Mobile devices are becoming a popular target for hackers. 'This is hardly a surprise given so many of us have between one and three of them, and they are increasingly used to store sensitive work files and personal information. 'The challenge with these devices is that because they connect to the cloud, data ends up being stored in multiple places and this gives the hackers multiple attack points to use. 'Therefore, unless security controls are in place and companies understand the location of where the data is being stored, there is a greater risk that these devices or their data could be breached.' A BullGuard survey has revealed that 'an alarmingly high number' of people don't give much consideration to what they post online. For example, while 64 per cent of respondents said they give thought to their online reputation 36 per cent said they didn’t. A further 77 per cent said they also consider what they post might affect other people, but 23 per cent said it 'barely entered their minds'. More than 40 per cent said they post content about other people, while 59 per cent said they never do. 'From a security and privacy perspective, the predicted pervasive introduction of sensors and devices into currently intimate spaces - such as the home, the car, and with wearables and ingestibles, even the body - poses particular challenges.' It added the Commission will continue to 'enforce laws, educate consumers and businesses, and engage with consumer advocates, industry, academics, and other stakeholders' to promote appropriate security and privacy protections. There are also industry-led bodies that are already working on securing and standardising the IoT protocols. There are also industry-led bodies that are already working on securing and standardising the IoT protocols for smart gadgets (illustrated in this graphic). For example, the AllSeen Alliance has developed 'a secure, persistent connectivity protocol' between Wi-Fi routers and cloud providers . IoT gadgets include the the August smart lock (pictured left). Fitted to the existing door lock, the battery-powered device is controlled by the August app. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app (pictured right) For example, at this year's CES, the AllSeen Alliance announced it had developed 'a secure, persistent connectivity protocol' between Wi-Fi routers and cloud providers. Alliance members include Qualcomm, Microsoft, and Cisco, among others. This protocol is a step towards managing the security and privacy of all smart gadgets that are used in the car and home, and the work is based on an existing open source protocol called AllJoyn. AllJoyn was set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011. It is software that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn. The company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further. Another device is a smart security alarm called Canary (pictured). It can be connected to smart lights from LiFx. The lights could then flash in the bedroom, to silently alert homeowners to an intruder downstairs . Such IoT gadgets include the the August smart lock. Fitted to an existing door lock, the battery-powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the August app. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app. The lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired Bluetooth device. It then confirms the visitor's identity. Using AllJoyn, this lock can also be connected to a smart smoke or security alarm, such as Nest. When the alarm detects smoke, it triggers an event that is picked up by the lock. The lock then automatically opens to let people leave the house in a fire quickly. Another device is a smart security alarm called Canary. It can be connected to smart lights from LiFx. The lights could then flash in the bedroom, for example, to silently alert homeowners to the fact there is an intruder downstairs.","Guidelines were announced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

"Animals will finally be classed as living beings after a bill which has been approved by French MPs . For hundreds of years they have been given the same legal status as a table or a chair, but now animals will finally be classed as living beings after a contentious bill has been approved by French MPs. Nearly 700,000 signed a petition against the archaic 1804 law that states that animals are just ‘movable goods’. The bill describes animals as ‘living and feeling beings’. It gives France’s 63 million pets more protection against cruelty. Philosopher and former education . minister Luc Ferry signed the petition and said that the Napoleonic . legislation, which placed animals on the same level as furniture, was . ‘absurd’. He said: ‘No . one has ever tortured a clock. 'Animals suffer, they have emotions and . feelings. It is not a question of making animals subjects of the law… . but simply of protecting them against certain forms of cruelty.’ The . upgraded status will also mean that couples can fight for shared . custody in divorce cases and owners whose pets are run over by a . negligent driver will be able to claim compensation for the suffering . caused. Frédéric Lefebvre, the former trade minister, said that inheritance law would also change to allow owners to leave their fortune to their pets. However, the move was denounced as a dangerous attack on the French way of life by critics who said that it could lead to the end of breeding, hunting, fishing, bull-fighting and the eating of red meat. Critics also fear that animal rights activists would use the law to challenge slaughter practices on the ground that it is wrong to kill ‘beings with feelings’. Frédéric Lefebvre, the former trade minister, said that inheritance law would also change to allow owners to leave their fortune to their pets . Philippe Gosselin, a centre-right MP, said: ‘Agriculture will be threatened, along with wolf culls and… hunting. 'And what about laboratories and abattoirs, which could find themselves in very complicated legal cases?’ Proposals to ban cockfights and bullfighting were rejected.","Nearly 700,000 signed a petition against the archaic 1804 law .

"An ancient partial skull provides the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside Neanderthals and could have interbred 55,000 years ago. Recently discovered in Manot Cave in West Galilee, Israel, the bone sheds new light on our ancient relatives living in the area. The find challenges a previous theory that the two species potentially met 45,000 years ago somewhere in Europe. An ancient partial skull (pictured) provides the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside Neanderthals and could have interbred 55,000 years ago . Professor Hershkowitz Israel of Tel Aviv University holds up the 55,000 year old partial skull . The presence of the skull and its dating casts light on what may be the first human migrations out of Africa . The skull fragment, centre is placed between a Neanderthal skull, left, and a complete modern human skull, right, showing how it more closely resembles the modern human skull . The ‘Levantine cranium from Manot Cave (Israel) foreshadows the First European modern humans,’ according to the study, published in Nature. Modern Europeans have inherited about four percent of their genes from Neanderthals, meaning the two groups mated at some point in the past. ‘It has been suspected that modern man and Neanderthals were in the same place at the same time, but we didn't have the physical evidence. Now we do have it in the new skull fossil,’ said palaeontologist Bruce Latimer, from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio. Despite the speculation, there is as yet no proof that the skull is from an individual descended from a human-Neanderthal tryst. But, the researchers said, the specimen 'provides important clues about the morphology of modern humans in close chronological proximity to a probable interbreeding event with Neanderthals.' Recently discovered in Manot Cave in West Galilee, Israel, (the exact location is marked with a circle), the bone sheds new light on early humans living in the region . The prehistoric cave (pictured) has an impressive archaeological sequence and spectacular speleothems - mineral deposits formed from groundwater within underground caverns, such as stalactites, the experts said . The enormous Manot cave was discovered by accident after a bulldozer broke through the roof while cutting a sewer trench for a nearby village. It's thought to have remained sealed for as long as 30,000 years . A view of the stalagmites rising form the floor of the cave like the columns of some twisted cathedral . Manot Cave, in West Galilee is located in the region where Neanderthals periodically lived - perhaps when ice sheets in Europe forced them to migrate to warmer locales, such as the Levant region . Animal bones and prehistoric tools were among the other discoveries made inside the Manot Cave . It is commonly thought that Neanderthals died out because they were unable to compete with modern humans for food and resources. A recent study by the University of Oxford suggests that both groups co-existed for between 2,600 and 5,400 years and some interbreeding occurred. Experts believe that Neanderthals ‘may have survived in dwindling pockets of Europe’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct, instead of being immediately replaced by modern humans. The study didn’t cover eastern regions such as Uzbekistan and Siberia, where Neanderthals are also known to have lived. ‘So it is still possible Neanderthals lingered later in some areas,’ Professor Chris Stringer said. ‘Overall pattern seems clear - the Neanderthals had largely, and perhaps entirely, vanished from their known range by 39,000 years ago.’ The Manot Cave is located in a region where Neanderthals periodically lived - perhaps when ice sheets in Europe forced them to migrate to warmer locales, such as the Levant region. The prehistoric cave has an impressive archaeological sequence and spectacular speleothems - mineral deposits formed from groundwater within underground caverns, such as stalactites, the experts said . It is situated along the only land route available for ancient humans to travel out of Africa to the Middle East, Asia and Europe. ‘Modern humans and Neanderthals likely encountered each other foraging for food,’ Dr Latimer said. Together with the study’s lead investigator, Professor Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University, he found the partial cranium was covered in a patina of minerals produced by the wet conditions of the cave. The patina allowed experts from the Geological Survey of Israel to use uranium-thorium dating technique, which determined that the skull was between 50,000 and 60,000 years old. Dr Latimer said that the skull contained a relatively small brain of around 1,100 millilitres. The modern human brain averages around 1,400 millilitres in comparison. He explained that several features of the cranium resemble a modern man’s skull, such as the lack of the occipital bun – a bony formation on the back of the skull. Because the skull is from an adult, CWRU researchers know it is not related to other sub-adult human teeth and bones also found in the cave (pictured) Researchers work inside the lower part of Manot cave, installing the grid . The vast Manot Cave is located in a region where Neanderthals periodically lived - perhaps when ice sheets in Europe forced them to migrate to warmer locales, such as the Levant region . It is also along the only land route for humans to travel out of Africa to the Middle East, Asia and Europe . This photo made available by the Manot research team shows excavations at area C of the cave (see below) The cave is situated along the only land route available for ancient humans to travel out of Africa to the Middle East, Asia and Europe .‘Modern humans and Neanderthals likely encountered each other foraging for food,’ Dr Latimer said. A map of the cave is shown and the location of the skull marked with a triangle . ‘It has been suspected that modern man and Neanderthals (illustrated) were in the same place at the same time, but we didn't have the physical evidence. Now we do have it in the new skull fossil,’ said palaeontologist Bruce Latimer . While its purpose is unknown, Neanderthals had the bun, which resembles a bony hot dog bun with a groove down the centre, but modern humans do not. The Manot Cave fossil's gender is unknown because it is missing the brow ridge - one marker for gender differences. The skull was discovered in 2008 by cave explorers who had abseiled through a newly opened roof. An archaeologist using the route is shown . Because the skull is from an adult, CWRU researchers know it is not related to other sub-adult human teeth and bones also found in the cave. Dr Mark Hans from the university, said: ‘This leads us to believe that there are likely more fossils in the cave where other bones associated with the skull might be found.’ The skull was discovered in 2008 by cave explorers who had abseiled through a newly opened roof of the previously unknown cave, which had been sealed for 30,000 years and an excavation programme followed. Commenting on the find, Professor Chris Stringer, Research Leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum, said: ‘In terms of its shape, this braincase portion clearly represents a modern human, and closely resembles the skulls of European “Cro-Magnons,” though for an adult individual it is a very small and gracile (presumably a female). ‘Without accompanying DNA data it is impossible to say whether the Manot skull contains Neanderthal DNA from an interbreeding event, but its resemblance to Cro-Magnons (who like recent Europeans retained a small percentage of Neanderthal DNA) and to recent Africans (who on average have much less Neanderthal DNA), suggests that any Neanderthal influence on its skull shape is minimal. ‘Manot might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the hypothesised out-of-Africa event about 60,000 years ago, a population whose descendants ultimately spread right across Asia, and also into Europe. ‘Its discovery raises hopes of more complete specimens from this critical region and time period.’ Yesterday it was announced that fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan have dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago. The short, thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in East Asia, according to anthropologists. The discovery suggests that it belonged to a previously unknown ancient human lineage. The fossilised lower jawbone (above) was dredged up in a fishing net 15 miles off the west coast of Taiwan . Experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in Asia until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago. The bone was was dredged up in a fishing net from the Penghu submarine channel, about 15 miles (25km) off the west coast of Taiwan. Anthropologists from the National Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan and the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread throughout Asia. Homo erectus, remains of which have been found in Java, Indonesia, and mainland China, tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth. The Penghu mandible (centre) found off the coast of Taiwan is much larger than the lower jawbones of Homo erectus from Java (left) and China (right), despite its much younger age according to the researchers . Researchers say that this suggests the robust-jawed 'Penghu man' had a different evolutionary origin from the 'classic' Homo erectus found in the area. It could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of Homo erectus. Dr. Yousuke Kaifu, an anthropologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who was involved in the study, told MailOnline: 'It is a well-preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position. 'What we can say is that it is clearly different from the known Homo erectus populations from northern China and Java, and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so.' He added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans. The Penghu Channel (seen above), where the jawbone was found, was once been part of mainland Asia .","Partial skull was recently discovered in Manot Cave in West Galilee, Israel .

"Burly trucker Glen Beardsmore might not be the sort you would expect to find crafting intricate cakes. But the 53-year-old former solider from Quinton, Birmingham, has not looked back since making the unusual switch from lorry driver to full-time baker. And now Glen is making a real splash in the cookery circles, standing next to Michelin-starred chefs and winning coveted international awards. Scroll down for video . Glen said his intricate designs - including this river scene - take him hours to create . Glen's 'river themed' creation  has won gold at the NEC's prestigious Salon Culinaire competition . His 'river themed' creation - 11 days in the making - has won gold at the NEC's prestigious Salon Culinaire competition. The cake, a sponge salmon, was judged best in the 'sculpted novelty' category. 'Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Michelin star chefs really is something,' said Glen, who runs his Nice & Iced Cake Company business from his home. 'Then to come out with ""Best in Class"" - I am still reeling.' Former trucker Glen is not the person you imagine to spend his days piping delicate icing . While Glen creates all manner of designs (left, Batman cake) his 'river' idea is his most complex (right) Glen was a Royal Engineer in the Royal Monmouthshire Militia with the Territorial Army - the most senior regiment in the British Army Reserve. He was in the army for nine years, joining in 1989 and leaving in 1998. The former soldier was then a HGV driver for 14 years, but was laid off by the Co-op in 2013. It was then that he decided to turn his kitchen prowess into a money-spinner. The river creation won Gold in the 'sculpted novelty' category, against cakes by Michelin starred chefs . 'I have always done the home cooking,' said Glen. 'And I made cakes for friends. 'It's hard work because there are a lot of cake makers out there. I don't miss being a lorry driver, but I am doing the same kind of hours. 'I'll get up at three or four in the morning and work through the night. The difference is I'm at home, not stuck in Luton.' The former soldier was an HGV driver for 14 years, but was laid off by the Co-op in 2013 . Glen has created incredibly detailed and realistic edible versions of guitars, handbags, Walsall FC's ground and even a machine gun. But the river scene was by far Glen's most complex creation. 'Everything is edible,' he said. 'The fish is made from sponge, the tree is chocolate.' Glen is still in touch with his old trucker and Army friends but does admit that customers are more surprised when they find out about the baker's past life. 'When I tell them I was a soldier and HGV driver, they do a double-take,' he laughed. It's not the first culinary award Glen has netted. Previous awards include gold at 2013 Cake International for a military-themed creation and bronze for a comic-booked themed sugar decoration.

"A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river, officials have ruled. Ministers wanted the remarkable animals, believed to be the first wild beavers to breed in England for 800 years, to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year. But Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, has decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind. Beavers won't be budging: A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river after Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, has decided they won't be put in a zoo, but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind . Devon Wildlife Trust, which will run the pilot project for the next five years, welcomed the decision as a ‘great day for conservation in England’. There are at least ten beavers thriving along a 12mile (19km) stretch of the River Otter near Exeter. They have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years, completely unnoticed until just over a year ago. It is an extraordinary environmental success story, for which green groups and conservationists can take no credit. Nobody knows where they came from – but they are certainly thriving without any outside interference. So environmentalists were furious when Defra, the Government’s environment department, decided last year that they would round up the beavers. There are at least ten beavers thriving along a 12 mile (19km) stretch of the River Otter near Exeter (shown on a map). They have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years, completely unnoticed until just over a year ago . Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. Some people think they may slow down flood waters, as well as boosting wildlife diversity. Farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes. Officials said that they posed a risk to other wildlife, and might spread parasites and disease. They ordered the beavers to be caged and either rehomed or culled, prompting a fierce campaign to allow the animals to remain free, backed by more than 12,000 people. The threat of a zoo or worse has now been averted. The beavers will be carefully tested for disease this spring and, as long as they are free of disease, will be allowed to stay on the River Otter. Tom Buckley, a retired environmental scientist who spotted the first beaver on the banks of the River Otter a year ago, said: ‘I am very grateful to all those people who have given their support to saving our beavers. ‘Currently there are few signs of the beaver on the river Otter, no dams or lodges, but beaver can do such a lot more to help improve the environment and now they have been given the chance, I'm looking forward very much to helping them show people just what they can do.’ But he said the Animal and Plant Health Agency must be very careful when they trap the beavers to test them for diseases in the coming weeks. He said: ‘There is still grave concerns regarding trapping the beavers, including the significant risk of drowning them and ensuring the safety of the kits who still rely on their parents for their survival. ‘None of the Animal and Plant Health Agency people licenced to trap the beavers have direct beaver skills or experience.’ Beavers, which are native to England, were plentiful in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. The Daily Mail revealed in November that there are three generations living on the River Otter, with at least ten individuals. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. A screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown . ‘Natural England has very carefully considered the Devon Wildlife Trust application against international standards, and has decided that a licence will be issued permitting the managed release into the wild of beavers currently resident in the River Otter, on a five year trial basis,' a Defra spokesman said. 'This decision is subject to the beavers being tested and found to be free of Echinococcus multilocularis parasite. ‘Our priority is to ensure humane treatment for the beavers while safeguarding human health, that’s why we will be working with the Devon Wildlife Trust to capture and test the animals before the trial begins.’ This proves that they have been quietly prospering and – crucially – breeding. Experts think they must have been there for at least five years, unnoticed. As well as being a rare victory for native English wildlife, conservationists say beavers directly benefit the environment. Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. He said: ‘We are really pleased that we have obtained this step forward. ‘It is a really important day for conservation in England, a really great day for conservation in England. We are looking forward to making this trial a success.’ Andrew Sells, Natural England chairman, whose board agreed to give Devon Wildlife Trust the licence for the project, said: ‘Reintroduction of a species is a complicated and emotive subject and we have considered this application very carefully. ‘We are now satisfied with Devon Wildlife Trust’s plans for managing and monitoring the project, which will allow important evidence to be gathered during the trial on any impacts which the beavers may have.’ Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. An adult beaver with her young is shown . Beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity. They are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild. The animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft, weigh up to 70lbs, and feed on a diet of reeds, leaves and bark. Beavers were hunted almost to extinction in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties. The beavers’ presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes in the UK, including thirty miles away in western Devon, on the other side of Dartmoor. But none of the animals is unaccounted for. Other explanations touted by locals include their escape from a private collection, or a deliberate release by wildlife fanatics. There is a slim chance they travelled from Scotland, where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers, or even from Europe, where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes. The Daily Mail revealed in November that three generations are living on the River Otter and campaigned to save them (shown) Conservationists welcomed today’s decision, but not everyone will be happy. Farmers and anglers have raised concerns that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes, and said conservation efforts should be focused on the UK’s existing wildlife. Clinton Devon Estates, which owns part of the land where the beavers are living, welcomed the decision but warned of the need to manage problems and compensate people whose livelihoods are damaged. Sam Bridgewater, nature conservation manager for Clinton Devon Estates, said: ‘If their numbers increase, then it is inevitable that they will eventually start to engineer their local environment. ‘This will bring all kinds of benefits such as a potential slowing down of flood waters and an increase in the diversity of wildlife habitats, but will also likely cause some grief. ‘We very happy to work with other parties such as Natural England and the Devon Wildlife Trust to ensure this trial is a success.’ Harry Barton, chief executive of Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ‘This is an historic moment. The beavers of the River Otter are the first breeding population in the English countryside for hundreds of years. ‘We believe they can play a positive role in the landscapes of the 21st century through their ability to restore our rivers to their former glories. ‘We know from our own research and research done in Europe that beavers are excellent aquatic-engineers improving the flood and drought resilience of our countryside and increasing the water quality of our rivers.’ Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron, said: ‘If, as seems likely, they can now remain in the wild, it will be a major victory for common sense and everyone who has campaigned on their behalf. ‘Beavers add to Britain’s rich natural heritage and can bring huge benefits to the local environment, such as boosting wildlife and reducing flooding risks.’","Beavers have been living and breeding on the River Otter, in Devon for five years and went completely unnoticed until a year ago .

"A new audio message purporting to be of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto has said a Jordanian air force pilot held by Islamic State militants will be killed unless an Iraqi female prisoner held by the Jordanian authorities is released by sunset. The message, which has not yet been verified, is currently being analyzed by the Japanese government. In the audio recording, a voice purporting to be that of Goto states: 'I am Kenji Goto. This is a voice message I've been told to send to you. 'If Sajida al-Rishawi is not ready for exchange for my life at the Turkish border by Thursday sunset 29th of January Mosul time, the Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh will be killed immediately.' The message was posted on YouTube early this morning. Air pilot Kaseasbeh was captured by ISIS and along with Goto, is being used as a makeweight for the release of failed suicide bomber al-Rishawi, who is currently imprisoned in Jordan following her involvement in a 2005 bombing. Scroll down for video . Anwar Tarawneh (second from right) is comforted by pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh's sister during a protest . His wife (left) and sister held a protest at the front of the Royal Palace in Amman, Jordan, today . Anwar Tarawneh is comforted by relatives as she awaits news of her husband's fate, who could yet be swapped with ISIS for a failed suicide bomber currently held in a Jordanian prison . It was reported yesterday Jordan had agreed to release Sajida al-Rishawi, who was sentenced to death for her part in an Al-Qaeda attack on the Jordanian capital in 2005, in exchange for the pilot. However, a government spokesman said she was still being held prisoner, while the country's King Abdullah II reassured the pilot's parents things remained 'positive'. An earlier statement from the country's Foreign Minister said ISIS had not proved the Jordanian pilot was still alive. At 3pm (GMT) yesterday, Nasser Judeh wrote on Twitter: 'We asked a while ago for proof that hero Maaz (al-Kaseasbeh) is alive but we have not received anything.' In Jordan, the pilot's father, Safi al-Kasaesbeh, begged the government 'to meet the demands' of the Islamic State group. 'All people must know, from the head of the regime to everybody else, that the safety of Mu'ath means the stability of Jordan, and the death of Mu'ath means chaos in Jordan,' he said. Jordan's King Abdullah II later met with the pilot's parents and reassured them 'things were still positive', Sky News reported. Information Minister Mohammed al-Momani said 'Jordan is ready to release the Iraqi prisoner' if al-Kaseasbeh is released unharmed, according to a statement on Jordan's state television. Mr al-Momani made no mention of Mr Goto. Mr Judeh later said on his official Twitter account that a Jordanian request for proof that Kaseasbeh was safe and well had gone unanswered. Safi al-Kaseasbeh, the father of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, has begged his government to do all they can to save his son .

Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh is pictured in a car during a sit-in in front of the cabinet offices in Amman calling for his release . The mother of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto has made a tearful appeal to the country's prime minister to save her son . In separate developments, efforts to free the Japanese journalist were thrown into confusion yesterday after Tokyo was forced to deny reported comments by one of its ministers that a deal was imminent. The Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister was earlier reported as saying that Mr Goto would be released 'within hours' in a prisoner exchange deal for al-Rishawi. If this morning's recording proves to be a legitimate threat, this would appear to be incorrect. Yasuhide Nakayama, who is in Amman to co-ordinate the hostage-release efforts, reportedly said 'good news' was expected in the coming hours, according to Al Jazeera. Rumours of the imminent release also circulated on other media. However, the claims were quickly denied by the Japanese embassy. Jordan is reportedly in indirect talks with the militants through religious and tribal leaders in Iraq to secure the hostages' release. Earlier, Mr Goto's mother made a tearful appeal to the country's prime minister to save her son. Junko Ishido pleaded for Japan's leader to take further action after the militants issued a final death threat in a video on Tuesday.

A woman along with other protesters hold a placard and chant 'Free Goto' during a rally outside the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo yesterday . Protesters chant 'Free Goto' during a demonstration in front of the Prime Minister's Official residence in Tokyo . The militants have already reportedly killed one Japanese hostage, Haruna Yukawa, in a move that's stunned Japan. Although many in Japan are critical of the two men for going to Syria, Goto's friends and supporters have launched a social media campaign calling for his release. Tuesday's video resembled a message released over the weekend that purportedly withdrew a demand for $200 million in ransom for Goto and Yukawa made in an earlier message. The latest message condemns Jordan for not releasing al-Rishawi, saying that unless she is freed within 24 hours, the pilot, followed by Goto, will be killed. It says it is the group's last message. 'I have only 24 hours left to live and the pilot has even less,' says the audio. Messages from other Western hostages held by the group have been read by the captives on camera and it is unclear why the group released only a recording and still picture. Mr Goto, 47, a war correspondent with experience in Middle East hot spots, went to Syria in late October to try to help Mr Yukawa . At an earlier press conference, Mrs Ishido (pictured) said her son was 'not an enemy of the people of the Islamic faith' and said she was praying for his release . Mr Goto, pictured, is a war correspondent with experience in Middle East hot spots. He went to Syria in late October to try to help Mr Yukawa, who was described as a friend, after he was captured in Aleppo in August . Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, 26, was seized after his Jordanian F-16 crashed near the Islamic State group's de facto capital of Raqqa in December. He is the first foreign military pilot they have captured since a U.S.-led coalition that includes Jordan began its aerial campaign against the Islamic State group in August. This is the first time that the group has publicly demanded the release of prisoners in exchange for hostages. Previous captives may have been released in exchange for ransom, although the governments involved have refused to confirm any payments were made. Goto, a freelance journalist, was caught in October in Syria, apparently while trying to rescue Yukawa, 42, who was taken hostage last summer. Securing the release of al-Rishawi would be a major propaganda coup for the Islamic State and would allow the group to reaffirm its links to al-Qaida in Iraq. The mother of another Jordanian prisoner, Ziad al-Karboli, said her family was told the Islamic State group also wants his release as part of a swap, but it is unclear if that was related to a possible deal involving the Japanese hostage. Al-Karboli, an aide to a former al-Qaida leader in Iraq, was sentenced to death in 2008 for killing a Jordanian citizen.","Japanese government is trying to verify purported new ISIS recording .

"School officials ordered two dozen elementary school students to pull down their pants so they could inspect their underwear after feces was found on the gym floor, it has been claimed. Students as old as 11 in the tiny Texas town of Gustine were divided into girls and boys before being marched into separate rooms, distraught parents told WFAA. They were then ordered 'to pull down their pants to check them to see if they could find anything', one mother, Maria Medina, told the channel. School scandal: Students at the Gustine elementary school in Texas (pictured) complained that staff members ordered them to pull down their pants to check for signs of poop after some was found in the gym . Gustine Independent School District Superintendent Ken Baugh, who is investigating the claims, said the children were asked to pull down their trousers just a little. But Medina's 11-year-old daughter Eliza said she was told to pull them down 'to where your butt is'. 'I felt uncomfortable, and I didn't want to do it,' she said. 'I felt like they violated my privacy.' Her mother said she was furious when she learned what had happened. 'If you can't do your job or you don't know what you're doing, you need to be fired,' she told WFAA. 'You shouldn't be here.' Baugh said that the district does not support the decision and is looking into possible disciplinary action against the staff members involved. He said that he hopes to interview all the staff members and have a final answer by Wednesday. Parents have said they plan to protest against the action at a school board meeting on Thursday. Gustine, which is about 90 miles southwest of Fort Worth, has a population of just 457.","Two dozen students in Gustine, Texas were ordered to pull down their pants 'to check to see if staff could find anything,' irate parents said .

"The parents of missing mother Nicola Payne today said they were determined to find their daughter 23 years after she disappeared at the age of just 18. Two men appeared in court charged with murdering the teenager today, but her mother Marilyn and father John said their 'ultimate aim' was to discover Nicola's whereabouts. Nigel Barwell and Thomas O'Reilly, both 50, attended a brief hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. Missing: The parents of Nicola Payne have launched a new appeal to find their daughter . Emotional: John and Marilyn Payne outside Birmingham Magistrates' Court today . After the hearing, Nicola's parents said they welcomed the fact that the men had been charged and vowed to find their daughter. In a statement read by Nicola's aunt, Melanie Eales, they said: 'Although this is a significant step, our ultimate aim has always been to find Nicola in order to bring some peace to our family. 'The past 23 years have been extremely difficult and we would urge anybody with any info to contact police or Crimestoppers.' They added: 'Police have kept us updated throughout this investigation and we would like to thank everyone for their support over the years.' Barwell and O'Reilly, from Coventry, spoke only to confirm their names, ages and addresses during the brief hearing.

The public gallery was packed for the hearing with Nicola's parents present, along with friends and relatives of both defendants. The pair were remanded to appear via video link at Birmingham Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on Friday. Afterwards, an emotional Mrs Payne, with tears in her eyes, led the family from court, supported by her relatives. The two men are alleged to have killed Nicola between December 13 and 16, 1991. No trace of her body has ever been found. They were first arrested in connection with Nicola's disappearance in late 2013, and had been on bail until they were formally charged by detectives from West Midlands Police this week. Nicola has not been seen since she set off from her boyfriend's house in Coventry on her way to pick baby clothes and food from her parents' home in December 1991.

He said: 'Yesterday's charges and today's court appearance mark a significant milestone in the search for what happened to Nicola Payne on December 14, 1991. 'West Midlands Police are committed to finding out exactly what happened on that day, and the thrust of the investigation now turns to finding Nicola's remains.' He thanked those who had provided information, in particular since the inquiry was reopened in 2012. Mr Slevin added: 'However, I am confident there are people still out there who hold the information that is key to this inquiry and I would urge them today, following these charges, to please contact the police or Crimestoppers, in confidence, and pass us that information so we can take it forward.'

"The team behind the latest awareness campaign from breast cancer charity CoppaFeel! were forced to find billboards away from roads - to make sure drivers weren't distracted by bare chests on show. The images, which will also appear in magazines and shop changing rooms, feature 'real' women who posed topless in support of the new #whatnormalfeelslike campaign. But sites for the billboards, unveiled today at sites in Liverpool and Glasgow, had to be carefully chosen in order to make sure they didn't breach advertising rules - or cause car crashes. Scroll down for video . National campaign: The digital billboards were unveiled in Liverpool and Glasgow today as part of breast cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel!'s latest campaign. Above, a woman in Liverpool photographs the image . Prominent: The photographs, seen above on a massive high-resolution screen in Liverpool, show the bare breasts of 24 'real' women. Each image is printed with a word the women used to describe their chest . The photographs, which are broadcast on massive high-resolution screens, show the bare breasts of 24 'real' women. Each image is printed with a word the women used to describe their chest. Guidelines set by industry watchdog the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) say that bare breasts should not be published in a sexualised manner. They should also not be published in a way that might offend children, or someone's religious beliefs. As it was not an advert, the CoppaFeel! campaign fell into a 'grey area' when it comes to the code, explained Caitlin Ryan, executive creative director at advertising agency Karmarama that worked on the project. According to codes set by the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP), advertisements must not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence. This includes publishing adverts that may be deemed 'overly sexual', and those which may offend someone for religious reasons. Particular attention is paid to children, and the code urges advertisers to consider whether their publication exposes children to 'irresponsible sexual imagery'. While there is no set definition as to what this means, examples given by the Advertising Standards Authority - the body that enforces the CAP code - include images of posing seductively in lingerie or skimpy swimwear. In addition to these rules, charities are also given rules to stop them taking advantage of people's kindness and impulse to give to charity. But the team still had to work to minimise the offense it could potentially cause - and therefore the risk of the advert being removed. Ms Ryan told MailOnline: 'The challenge here is that outdoor advertising is a broadcast medium so it is difficult to restrict who will see a particular billboard site so the risk was that the level of nudity could be deemed unsuitable for children or cause offense on religious grounds. 'It therefore became a careful balancing act between avoiding causing offense but getting the important empowerment message to our audience.' The conflict led the team to seek out locations in three shopping centres, Westfield Point, Liverpool Cavern Quarter, Glasgow Enoch Square, and Westfield London - which launches next month. Based on data provided by media company Ocean Outdoor, the team found the spots had high footfall of their target audience, young women, and were visited by very few children. Crucially, the locations are all also away from the road so they avoid distracting drivers. The billboards are the second phase in a nationwide campaign. The first set, launched last October, featured seven bare-chested women, photographed by British photographer Rankin. While the first campaign received CAP approval, the team were cautioned in featuring images of bare breasts across billboards. It received no complaints. It is not yet known whether the Advertising Standards Agency received any complaints relating to the new billboards. Founders: Twins Kris and Maren Hallenga, pictured last year, who founded CoppaFeel! after Kris was diagnosed with breast cancer . Breast cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel! was founded by 28-year-old identical twins Kris and Maren Hallenga, after their lives were turned upside down in 2009. That year, when the girls were just 23, Kris was diagnosed with breast cancer -  eight months after first going to her GP with concerns about lumps she was finding in her painful chest. Dismissed as 'hormones' and told she was far too young to have the disease, the cancer went undiagnosed for so long that it spread to her spine, only finally diagnosed when the twins' no-nonsense mother marched Kris to the doctor and demanded to be taken seriously. Raising awareness: Kris, left, and Maren Hallenga at a CoppaFeel! flash mob organised in London in 2012 . Kris was – and remains – at stage four, the most advanced type of cancer. There is no stage five. Straight away, Kris was thrown into a routine of radiotherapy, five months of chemotherapy, and yet more radiotherapy. She made it her mission to encourage other young people to get to know their breasts so that they might be able to detect any lumps early. Kris and Maren founded CoppaFeel! just one month after Kris' diagnosis. Kris is not cancer free – and perhaps never will be. But she’s keeping as well as she can, being treated at the hospital each month.","Billboards plastered with bare breasts unveiled in Glasgow and Liverpool .

"A 36st chef who was bombarded with mocking texts about his size from a well-meaning friend has lost a massive 21st in a year - and finally found love. Jamie Brooks, 31, piled on the pounds from the age of 14, when he started a part-time job in a kitchen and began picking at food all day. His weight rapidly spiralled out of control and by his twenties he had ballooned to nearly 36st. Scroll down for video . Jamie's weight dropped from 35st 10lb (left) to 14st 4lb (right), and his waist size halved from 60in to 32in after being convinced to go on a diet by his best friend, who bombarded him with harsh, yet inspirational texts like 'You'll be dead by the time you're 40.' The head chef would cook food all day for pub customers and then gorge on fast food for his own meals because he couldn't face going back into the kitchen at home. To keep up his energy at work, Jamie guzzled sugary drinks from the bar and ate jumbo-sized packs of Galaxy minstrels in one sitting. He had to buy his giant size 7XL tops from a specialist supplier and became resigned to the fact that he would never find love. But with the help of some very harsh words from a well-meaning friend, Jamie started to turn his life around. Jamie's good friend Neil Williamson, 46, started to send him texts labelling him a 'fat f**k' every day for six weeks, which ended with finally deciding to go on a diet. In just 12 months, his weight dropped by almost two thirds, from 35st 10lbs to 14st 4lbs, and his waist size halved from 60in to 32in. Jamie piled on the pounds from age 14, when he started working in a kitchen and picking at food all day . Jamie would gorge on fast food for his own meals because he couldn't face going back into the kitchen at home . Around the same time he started the diet in January 2014, he became friendly Melanie Mulley, his neighbour in Crowcombe, Somerset. Jamie - who admits he was 'terrible' with girls - would go to her house during breaks from work at the Carew Arms in Crowcombe to have his diet milkshake. Confidence issues meant he never found the courage to tell her how he felt until New Year's Eve four weeks ago, after he had completed his astonishing weight loss. But unfortunately for Jamie, it looked like he had left it too late - Melanie, 36, was preparing to move back to West Wickham, Cambs, where she comes from. For a week and a half, she and Jamie had a week of uncertainty about their future - by January 11, she had already packed up her removal van and sent it off on the 200-mile journey to Cambridgeshire. It took his well-intentioned friend's constant reminder of the reality of his size (left, before he lost weight) to spur Jamie into starting his diet (right, pictured after his weight loss holding a pair of his old trousers) But as she was about to follow it, she suddenly decided she couldn't be apart from Jamie and instead moved in with him on the spot - exactly a year to the day after he started his diet. Jamie said: 'It was a confidence issue on my behalf. I had no luck with girls and didn't think she'd like me but my confidence changed when I lost weight. 'I don't know if she would have wanted to be with me when I was fatter but being more secure in myself definitely made me more attractive as a person.' Melanie, who has a three year-old daughter, said: 'His confidence grew as he lost weight and I was really proud of what he'd achieved. 'On New Year's Eve he told me I was beautiful inside and out. 'I really realised how much he meant to me when I was moving. 'We'd loaded the van up that morning and I was sitting in the house, getting the last bits ready to go. 'I just said to my friends, ""I don't think I can go"" and I said, ""I've got to go and tell Jamie."" 'I legged it over to the pub and that's when I said ""I can't leave.""' Most gratifying of all, Jamie has now found love with friend Melanie . Jamie started the Ideal Weight diet on January 11 last year after his friend Neil, a camper van salesman, saw an advert for it in his local GP surgery. He was also spurred on by the texts from Neil which told him: 'You'll be dead by the time you're 40'. Proud Jamie, who used to feel exhausted and lethargic but is now a bundle of energy, says he feels like a 'new man'. He added: 'I just got bigger and bigger as a child, I was never slim. 'I would combat the embarrassment by laughing it off and I'd just be the fat jolly one of the group. 'It took the full six weeks to motivate me to do something but I'm so glad I did. Neil has saved my life, I can't thank him enough. 'I never made plans for the future as I always thought I would be dead at a young age, but now I'm healthy and have an amazing girlfriend - I'm a new man.' Jamie on his way to losing the weight last summer . The one thing Jamie is frustrated by though, is that he has been rejected by the NHS to have excess skin removal surgery. He said: 'I've done the hard work off my own back and the surgery would be a lot cheaper than an gastric band. 'I see people with boob jobs on the NHS and I think it's unfair that I've been rejected. 'However I do understand there are people more in need and I'm just glad I'm healthy.' The Ideal Weight diet took him down to just 640 calories a day with his regular meals replaced with milkshakes, soups and bars.

"A Washington state mother has been convicted of battery after she claimed for years that her daughters were suffering from severe health problems and even convinced doctors to perform unnecessary surgery, prosecutors say. Carmen Boyce, 35, of Kenmore, Washington, went so far as to force one young daughter to throw up when doctors weren't looking in an effort to convince them that the little girl couldn't keep food down, authorities say. After repeated trips to Seattle Children's Hospital over claims that her oldest daughter wasn't eating, Ms Boyce insisted that surgeons insert a feeding tube into her stomach through an invasive procedure called ercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, according to court documents. Carmen Boyce, 35, has now lost custody of both of her children after prosecutors accused her of forcing them to endure unnecessary medical treatments . Doctors at Children's Hospital claim they were convinced Boyce's pleas were truthful and went ahead with the procedure on the girl, who was three years old at the time. However, prosecutors claim that both of Boyce's daughters were perfectly healthy all along - except for their mothers' meddling. When the girls, now age four and six, were removed from Boyce's custody, they exhibited no health problems at all. Boyce has furiously fought the charges, hiring a top Seattle criminal defense attorney who battled the case for nearly two years. On Tuesday, she pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor fourth-degree domestic assault - but admitted no wrongdoing, saying only that prosecutors likely had enough evidence to win a jury conviction. Boyce pleaded guilty, but refused to admit wrongdoing. She will likely avoid jail time . She is likely to avoid jail, but must undergo psychiatric treatment. Prosecutors also recommended that she have no unsupervised contact with either of her daughters. In motions filed by her attorney, David Allen, Boyce argued that the behavior that led to her arrest in May 2013 was the result of a misunderstanding by doctors and a witness. Both Boyce and Allen declined to comment for this story. She was arrested after a parent of another patient at Children's Hospital, who happens to be a nurse, reported to hospital staffer the Boyce appeared to induce vomiting in her young daughter during a visit, authorities say. Boyce had taken the girl to the hospital and told doctors that she wasn't eating and could not keep food down. According to prosecutors, the witness saw Boyce throw her daughter over her knee and tickle her until she lost control and vomited.","Carmen Boyce, 35, pleaded guilty to two counts of fourth degree assault on a family member - but admitted no wrongdoing .

"An unemployed fitness fanatic who spends four hours a day working out says he claims benefits because he is 'too fit to work'. Kamran Kam, from East London, who receives £72.50 per week in Jobseeker's Allowance, says he has stopped looking for a 9-5 job because the 'boring' lifestyle would interfere with his strict regime. The 25-year-old even believes the super-fit should receive extra government handouts for staying in shape so they can be 'free of everyday work'. Scroll down for video . Fitness fanatic and martial arts addict Kamran Kam, from East London, trains for four hours per day and claims he does not have time to look for a job . The 25-year-old (right), pictured with his Kung Fu teacher Sifu King (left), believes super-fit people should receive extra government handouts for staying in shape . And he believes his lifestyle is less strain on government resources than those 'overweight people' who are unable to work and 'spend all their benefits on junk food and cigarettes'. Mr Kam - who already gets half-price gym membership because he is unemployed - said: 'I've had all sorts of jobs, from admin and customer service work, to kitchen and security placements. The problem was, all the positions were way too boring for me. 'Not only that, I wasn't happy about paying taxes that go towards people who are sitting at home all day and making no contribution to society - especially overweight people who spend all their benefits on junk food and cigarettes. 'I, on the other hand, am extremely dedicated to my fitness, and I simply don't have time to waste spending all day doing a monotonous job, so in November last year I decided to give up work altogether. 'I am now happy to say I'm too busy staying fit, doing Kung Fu and loving life to get a 9-5.' He added: 'I don't see why someone of my fitness level and talent should be wasted in an office or shop.' Mr Kam, who lives with his mother and 27-year-old brother, currently claims £72.40 a week in JSA. But he openly admits that he is making no effort to get a job, believing that fit people should not have to pay taxes that go towards treating overweight people on the NHS. Mr Kam, pictured with Martial Artist Silvio Simac, said his mother wants him to get a 'normal, boring job' but that life is too short to 'conform to society' He said: 'That's part of the reason I refuse to get a 9-5 job- why should I have to sacrifice my own fitness levels to help pay for lazy people that sit on their backsides eating all day? 'I know some people might say I should go and get a 9-5 job and stop claiming benefits, but I'd bet most of those people cost just as much in NHS fees as I do on JSA. 'At the end of the day, I can't remember the last time I went to the doctors, and I live with my mum so I'm not asking for housing either. 'I'm not saying all fat people choose to be that way, but in reality a large proportion of the people who claim benefits are totally wasting government money and have no ambition at all. 'What I'm doing with my life is far more of a testament to my country than pen pushing all day in some office job I don't enjoy.' He added that the government should give him extra money for staying in shape. 'The government should give free gym membership and fitness courses - but only to the super-fit,' he said. 'It should be totally free really- when you think the government spends £5bn a year on tackling obesity it's absurd that fit people have to pay anything at all to stay in shape. 'They should also work out a system that enables fit people to be free of everyday work if they are tied down in a boring job such as customer service or retail. 'If they have a fitness-related job I believe they should be asked to keep working. 'If more people were fit and healthy the government would save millions of pounds every year- even after paying out JSA and housing benefits.' The unemployed sportsman says he does have plans to make money in the future and is pursuing a career on the silver screen . Mr Kam, pictured centre with actress Selina Lo and actor Cryptik Soul, receives £72.50 per week in Jobseeker's Allowance . Mr Kam says that his mother Rahela, who works in child care, wishes he would get 'a normal, boring job' but that life is too short to 'conform to what society wants you to do'. He said: 'Life is too short to do something you don't enjoy- it's not all about working- it's more important to be fit and healthy and to look great as well. 'When I look at myself in the mirror and see my body I feel great. 'That is worth far more than going out and earning money just to conform to what society wants you to do.' He added: 'I am totally independent, driven, and self-sufficient, and I'm fortunate enough to be receiving free Kung Fu lessons from a top Chinese Kung Fu master. 'For me to go to work everyday and stop practising my art would be a total waste of talent.' Mr Kam says he does intend to earn money one day and wants to make his name as a martial arts actor on the silver screen. He said: 'A lot of people call me Jean-Claude Van Damme, because I can perform a lot of the moves he does and I'm told I look like him too. 'I'd love to get a part in a Kung Fu movie one day- that's my ultimate goal. He added: 'You have to makes sacrifices if you want to make a real impact on the world, and for me that means training at least five times a week for 3-4 hours each session. 'It can be physically tough, but at least I don't have to put my energy into anything else so I can focus on it 100 per cent.'

"Ambulance chiefs in Wales are today coming under intense pressure to improve after recording the worst set of emergency response figures in history. Just 42.6 per cent of the most serious emergency ambulance calls reached their casualty within the stipulated eight minutes in December. That figure is down almost 10 per cent from November's figure of 51 per cent. Performance figures on those Category A calls, which are deemed immediately life threatening, ranged from barely a quarter (28.3 per cent) in Torfaen to 61.5 per cent in Conwy. Scroll down for video . Ambulance response times have fallen to their worst levels on record, with just 42.6 per cent of responses to the most serious emergency calls (category A calls) reached their casualty within the stipulated eight minutes - short of the 65 per cent target set by the Welsh Government . Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have blamed the ‘truly appalling’ performance on cuts to the health service budget by the Labour-led administration in Cardiff. The Welsh Government dictates that 65 per cent of all emergency calls should be reached within eight minutes. Tracy Myhill, interim chief executive at the Welsh Ambulance Service, said: 'We completely appreciate that this presents an unacceptable level of service delivery across the whole health and social care system. 'An ageing population and more people with long-term illnesses means that more people than ever before are relying on our ambulance service. 'That's why we're rolling out a host of innovative new projects to help ease the pressure.' Ambulance crews in Wales were called to a total of 40,147 emergency calls in December - an increase of 11.2 per cent on November and 7.6 per cent up from December 2013. Of these, 16,078 were triaged as Category A calls, meaning the patient was thought to be in a life-threatening condition. That figure is a rise of 14.3 per cent of Category A calls in November, and 9.3 per cent rise on the same period in 2013. One in 10 ambulances took 30 minutes or more to arrive in December, and one in five emergency ambulance responses took longer than 20 minutes to arrive. Meanwhile figures from BBC Wales this morning showed police forces in Wales had to take patients to A&Es on 115 occasions in December. The interim chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, Tracy Myhill, said: 'We completely appreciate that this presents an unacceptable level of service delivery across the whole health and social care system' If all of these cases should have been covered by ambulances as Category A calls, it would suggest that police are covering around 0.7 per cent of emergency medical cases. Ms Myhill said among the measures introduced to help the service cope is inviting A&E consulatants to join paramedics in rapid response cars to help assess patients and decide whether to take them to A&E. And clinicans have been invited into ambulance control rooms, to ensure call handlers are sending the most appropriate resources to patients. In addition the Welsh Government has set aside an additional £11 million funding to help the ambulance service cope with such high demand. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: 'These figures demonstrate the immense pressure the Welsh ambulance service was under throughout December. 'The demand on the service was unprecedented. 'They are nevertheless disappointing and there is no complacency about the need to improve performance. 'The ambulance service's own figures show it received a record high demand for an emergency response to patients in imminent danger of death - 10.8 per cent higher than the second highest number of Red 1 calls reported in December 2012.' Leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew Davies, said: 'These figures are truly appalling and indicate the mess in which the health minister now finds himself. 'Clearly urgent action must now be taken to address the alarming decline in ambulance response times. 'These are the worst response times on record and it is vital that the health minister works with all interested parties to address the very serious issues facing the ambulance service in Wales. 'Despite the best efforts of dedicated Welsh NHS staff, ambulance response targets have not been met in Wales for several years but we appear to have reached a new low and Mr Drakeford faces serious questions.' Ed Miliband was accused of trying to ‘airbrush out’ his party’s shameful record on the NHS in Wales after it removed all references to the health service in leaflets sent out there. A Labour leaflet currently being sent to constituencies across England boasts about the party’s ‘plan for the NHS’ and includes several images of nurses, doctors and hospitals. But the version being delivered to Welsh homes makes no mention of the health service or Labour’s record there.","42.6% of the most serious emergency calls were reached within eight minutes in December - short of the 65% target set by Welsh Government .

"New York City lost an estimated $200 million in economic activity in the fizzled snowstorm and the decision to shut down the transit system  had the biggest impact on  businesses. Consumers who would have otherwise bought cars or made other major purchases will likely do so a day or two later, said Adam Kamins, an economist with Moody's Analytics, which came up with the preliminary loss estimate. He noted that many employees forced to stay home Tuesday were able to telecommute. Scroll down for videos . New York City lost an estimated $200 million in economic activity in the fizzled snowstorm and the decision to shut down the transit system had the biggest impact on businesses . In New York, small businesses and hourly workers who rely on tips, such as taxi drivers and restaurant workers, were keenly affected by the loss of work time . Adults and children sled at Brooklyn's Prospect Park the morning after the winter storm on Wednesday . 'For example, a holiday where people aren't working would have a greater impact on the economic output than this storm,' Kamins said. And some businesses benefited from the disruption, with Fresh Direct's sales rocketing 22 per cent before the storm swirled in and the Wegman grocery chain heralding recording breaking sales, Yahoo Finance reported. There were also reports of New Yorkers panic-buying lingerie as they prepared to snuggle up in the warm with their partners, with sales of underwear rocketing 500 per cent, according to the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation. Paul Walsh, vice president of weather analytics at The Weather Channel, told the site that 'things will rebound pretty quickly'. Mayor Bill de Blasio paid for 7,000 National Guard troops, 760 plows and 50,000 pounds of salt and stood his ground over his decision to shut the city down, saying that it was better to be safe than sorry. Evan Gold, senior vice president for Planalytics, a firm that advises companies on weather issues, estimated the economic losses for the total Northeast, including New York, Philadelphia and Boston, at $500 million. 'Now that does sound like a lot of money, but when you think about last year, where we had a polar vortex, several weeks of that, more population centers impacted as well as above-normal snowfall, last year's overall economic impact is pegged at anywhere from $15 billion to $50 billion,' he said. 'So in comparison, this is actually a relatively small event.' In New York, small businesses and hourly workers who rely on tips, such as taxi drivers and restaurant workers, were keenly affected by the loss of work time. Lenice Ferguson, a baker at Insomnia Cookies said the shop is usually open until about 3am making deliveries. The bakery closed at about 10pm Monday.

Pedestrians walking past MACY'S department store during the storm. De Blasio said economic loss was much less than it would have been had Juno hit in full force . Subways, rail lines, bridges and tunnels were all closed Monday night. Residents were told to stay off the streets after 11 pm or face fines. Transportation reopened Tuesday morning after it was clear the storm was a bust in New York City, with most areas getting about 8 inches instead of the predicted two feet. Fausto Cabrera opened his Upper West Side barber shot Tuesday morning but wasn't expecting many customers. 'There was nobody here yesterday and today, just look,' he said, pointing to six empty barber chairs. 'All I can do is wait.' De Blasio said economic loss was much less than it would have been had the storm hit in full force, and that taking precautions helped the city get back online faster. Moody's economist Kamins said that for the Northeast overall, the storm would have done about $16 billion in damage had it hit full force. Instead, the impact will likely reach just $1.25 billion. 'I will always err on the side of safety and caution,' de Blasio said Tuesday. 'We had consistently been getting reports talking about two feet or more of snow. To me it was a no-brainer, we had to take precautions to keep people safe.' Shaon Chowdhury, a manager of Arthur Cab Leasing Corp., in Queens, said he didn't have a problem with the city's actions even though he lost about $60,000 in revenue and expenses. 'If they did get 28 inches it would be a problem, so shutting down is a good idea,' he said. 'What happens if we did get 28 inches? It would have been hell.' New York City's 24,000 restaurants probably lost millions in revenue in total, said Chris Hickey, regional director of New York City for the New York State Restaurant Association. For the first time in the decade since it first opened a block north of Times Square, the TSQ brasserie deserted at mid-afternoon Monday. Business was down about 70 per cent.

"The post-mortem examination of poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko was ‘one of the most dangerous ever undertaken in the Western World’, a pathologist revealed yesterday. Dr Nathaniel Cary said the former KGB agent was carried to a secure room in two body bags because of the radiation coming from it. Taking no chances with safety during the three-hour autopsy, pathologists each wore two biochemical suits, two pairs of gloves and specialised hoods fitted with battery-powered breathing packs to avoid being contaminated by polonium-210. Scroll down for video . Poisoned: Alexander Litvinenko's body was highly radioactive after his death, an inquiry has heard . Hearing: Marina Litvinenko, left, with her solicitor Elena Tsirlina outside the Royal Courts of Justice . An expert was also on hand to wipe off any blood spatters and to monitor the team for any effects of radiation poisoning, the public inquiry into Mr Litvinenko’s death was told. Home Office pathologist Dr Cary said paramedics were also on standby because ‘it would have been a disaster if anyone had fainted or had an acute medical problem’. Describing how the London Ambulance Service had put a ‘casualty evacuation’ plan in place, he added: ‘I think it was felt that this was such a dangerous post-mortem to carry out that we really only wanted to do it once if at all possible. ‘It has been described as one of the most dangerous post-mortem examinations ever undertaken in the Western world, and I think that’s probably right.’ The former spy and critic of Vladimir Putin died from acute radiation poisoning in 2006 after two Russian hitmen are said to have laced his tea with polonium-210 at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair. Evidence: Pathologist Nathaniel Cary, left, and detective inspector Craig Mascall, right, were among those who addressed the inquiry yesterday . Widow: Marina Litvinenko is pictured arriving for the second day of the inquiry . Dr Cary had earlier told the inquiry how the body had presented a ‘considerable hazard’ on the intensive unit it was on at University College Hospital, London. After sealing the room and taking a tissue sample from Mr Litvinenko’s right thigh, the body was wrapped in two body bags before being taken to a secure room for examination, he said. The Royal Courts of Justice were told how Mr Litvinenko had ingested a ‘large quantity’ of polonium-210 and the amount his body absorbed was ‘in far excess of known survivability limits’. Dr Cary added: In terms of weight it’s a very tiny amount, but in terms of polonium-210 it is a large quantity.’ Mr Litvinenko, 43, is the first recorded person to have been killed by the highly radioactive chemical – a billionth of a gram of which is fatal and one gram could be enough to kill 100million people. The inquiry heard that polonium-210 emits alpha radiation rather than gamma radiation. That means it is only dangerous if it gets inside the body, where it continuously bombards cells as it is distributed around. The court was also told how hospital doctors were initially baffled over the cause of Mr Litvinenko’s deteriorating condition. The alleged murderer of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB officer who is now a Russian MP, declared last night that he 'couldn't care less' about the inquiry. Andrei Lugovoi was charged with killing Mr Litvinenko nearly eight years ago, but has never stood trial as he cannot be extradited from his native country. The Russian dissident was apparently poisoned with polonium while meeting Lugovoi and businessman Dmitri Kovtun at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair. Lugovoi had previously visited London twice within the previous month - and during one of his trips, Mr Litvinenko was the target of a botched poisoning attempt. After the ex-spy's death, attention focussed on Lugovoi as the principal suspect, and in May 2007 the Crown Prosecution Service charged him with murder. Russian authorities refused to extradite him to the UK, saying it would be against their constitution, but offered to put him on trial in his home country. Lugovoi's deviance of the British government has made his a cause celebre in Russia, and he was elected as an MP in late 2007. In 2012, he passed a televised lie-detector test which supposedly cleared him of Mr Litvinenko's murder - but critics claim that the device is nothing more than pseudo-science. Today Ben Emmerson QC, who represents the dead spy's widow Marina, read out part of an interview that Lugovoi gave to Echo of Moscow last night, in which he claimed that the inquiry was politically motivated. 'When the situation in Ukraine kicked off and the UK's geographical interest had likely begun to change, they had decided to dust off the moth balls and commence proceedings,' he said. He added that he 'couldn't care less about what's happening' in the inquiry, and claimed that he had not been asked to give evidence. Lugovoi concluded: 'This is an old story you are rehashing, an old story now.' Two days before his death medics decided ‘on a hunch’ to carry out specific tests which showed up polonium-210 poisoning. Another pathologist, Dr Benjamin Swift, said diagnosis was difficult because it was the ‘only case in the world’. ‘It would not have been forefront in the thought process of anyone and would not have been identified in routine toxicology,’ he said. Ben Emerson QC, representing the Litvinenko family, suggested it would be a good poison for anyone who wanted the cause of death to go undetected. He said: ‘The rarity of polonium-210 agent makes it so hard to detect. He was dying slowly over 23 days. It was not until the last day of his life polonium was identified. If this poison was administered as a means of murdering it would be very difficult for the cause of death to be identified. ‘Whoever made that decision [to use polonium-210] must have had access to a very highly specialised degree of scientific knowledge.’ The hearing continues.

Suspects: Dmitry Kovtun, left, and Andrei Lugovoi, right, have been accused of killing Mr Litvinenko . Litvinenko's teapot was 'covered with radiation traces', leading nuclear scientist tells inquiry . The teapot from which Alexander Litvinenko drank shortly before falling ill had 'off the scale' levels of radiation traces, the inquiry was heard. One of the country's top nuclear scientists - known only as 'Scientist A1' because of her secret work on the UK's nuclear deterrent - gave evidence to the hearing this afternoon. She was shown a 3D model of a teapot taken from the Millennium Hotel where Mr Litvinenko was allegedly poisoned in November 2006. The levels of radiation on the teapot were 'off the scale', she said, adding: 'The probe wouldn't be able to measure any higher. Meeting: Mr Litvinenko was apparently poisoned at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, pictured . 'There was a considerable amount of activity in the spout. It is more than probable this is the source of primary contamination. There was a form of polonium within the teapot.' Polonium-210 was also found in a hotel room occupied by Andrei Lugovoi, she told the inquiry. Scientist A1 said that the radioactive isotope is not present in nature, and to make a small amout it is necessary to take 'tonnes of material' and mix it in a nuclear reactor. She added that it would be impossible to tell where the substance was made simply by examining its structure. The deadly substance could easily be dissolved in liquid and would potentially be invisible to the naked eye, the hearing was told. 'In solution it often forms a colloid, a very fine distribution within the water matrix,' Scientist A1 said. 'It could be possible to detect it with human eye, you may not be able to. If it's completely soluble you won't be able to see it.' She said that the substance could be transported in a glass tube without any risk of alpha particles escaping.","Pathologist tells public inquiry the dead spy's body was highly radioactive .

"Crooked shop manager Tom Humble has avoided jail after stealing more than £23,000 worth of donated mobile phones . An assistant  manager at Vodafone has managed to avoid a jail term after he stole more than £23,000 worth of mobile phones which had been donated to charity. Tom Humble sold hundreds of the stolen phones online and pocketed the profits during the four year scam. The mobile phones had been donated at the store in Eastgate Shopping Centre in Basildon, Essex as part of a charity scheme. Customers were told their donated devices would be recycled with all proceeds going to charity. Instead, they were stolen by Humble who took 461 phones from the store before selling them on to mobile trading website Mazuma Mobile. Humble appeared at Basildon Crown Court yesterday where he was told the only reason he wasn't going to jail was because he had found himself a job and was supporting his family. He was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service. The 28-year-old, from Westcliff, Essex, had been working as a senior sales advisor on £17,000-a-year at the Vodafone store in the Eastgate Centre in Basildon, Essex, when the thefts began in 2009. A year later he was promoted to assistant manager but, despite a £6,500 pay rise, he continued to steal from the store's mobile phone recycling bin. His thefts were eventually exposed in late 2013 following an internal investigation by Vodafone who then called in Essex Police. Ian Clift, mitigating, claimed his client had stolen to help support his girlfriend in their new home and had now taken an honest office job in a bid to rebuild his life. The mobile phones had been donated at the Vodafone store in Eastgate Shopping Centre in Basildon, Essex (pictured) as part of a charity scheme . He added: 'His strategy for solving their problems was deeply flawed. 'He committed this crime with a heavy heart and feels a great deal of shame.' Sentencing Humble, Recorder Robert Glancy said: 'There are a lot of people in the country who find themselves under financial pressure but they do not resort to thieving from their employer when trusted to run a shop. 'This crime is made worse by the fact you knew the proceeds were going to charity. 'It is because you have found a job and are the source of support for your family you are not going to prison immediately.'

"A fugitive treasure hunter who allegedly failed to pay back his investors after discovering the greatest lost treasure in U.S. history has been arrested in Florida after more than two years on the lam. Tommy Thompson, 62, and his long-time companion Alison Anteike were found on Tuesday in their two-person suite at a Hilton in West Boca Raton, where they had been living for two years, and were taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals Service. The duo are awaiting a hearing in Florida before being extradited to Ohio, where a federal civil arrest warrant was issued in 2012 after Thompson failed to show up to a court hearing, said Brian Babtist, a senior inspector with the U.S. Marshals in Columbus. Scroll down for video . Arrests: Fugitive Tommy Thompson, left, and his long-time companion Alison Anteike, right, were taken into custody in Florida on Tuesday, two years after he failed to attend a court hearing . Thompson made history in 1988 when he found the sunken S.S. Central America, also known as the Ship of Gold. The vessel sank in a huge hurricane 200 miles off South Carolina in September 1857, claiming the lives of 425 people and thousands of pounds of California gold, contributing to an economic panic. But in 1988, Thompson and his crew brought up thousands of gold bars and coins from the shipwreck, in what was considered a technological feat at the time. Much of the gold was later sold to a gold marketing group in 2000 for about $50 million. But the 161 investors who paid Thompson $12.7 million to find the ship never saw returns from the sale. Two of them sued - a now-deceased investment firm president and the Dispatch Printing Company, which publishes The Columbus Dispatch newspaper and had invested about $1 million. That legal battle is ongoing, and those close to Thompson say it was his undoing. Arrested: Tommy Thompson, pictured in 1989 with a $50 pioneer gold piece he found in 1988 in a wreck of the gold ship Central America, was arrested on Tuesday after more than two years on the run . Found: A 1989 file photo shows gold bars and coins from the S.S. Central America, which was discovered by marine engineer Tommy Thompson. He reportedly recovered three tons of coins and bars from the wreck . Gil Kirk, who heads a Columbus real estate firm and is a former director of one of Thompson's companies, told The Associated Press last year that Thompson never cheated anyone. Kirk said proceeds from the 2000 sale of the gold all went to legal fees and bank loans. 'He was a genius, and they've stolen his life,' Kirk said of those who sued. Thompson went into seclusion in 2006, moving into a mansion called Gracewood in Vero Beach, Florida. Six years later, after the arrest warrant was issued, Thompson vanished. When the property's caretakers searched it soon afterward, they found prepaid disposable cellphones and bank wraps for $10,000, along with a bank statement in the name of Harvey Thompson - his nickname in college. The statement showed a $1 million balance, a real estate agent for the property said in court records. Vessel: An undated drawing shows the S.S.

Explorer: Thompson, left, stands at the helm of the Arctic Explorer in Norfolk, Virginia in 1991 . Caretakers also found a book called 'How to Live Your Life Invisible.' One marked page was titled: 'Live your life on a cash-only basis.' Columbus attorney Rick Robol, who at one time defended Thompson's company, has said there's no proof Thompson stole anything. He said he's been concerned about Thompson's health, which is why he called the arrest 'the best thing that can happen for everybody.' No criminal charges have been filed against Thompson, but Babtist said the treasure hunter will likely be ordered held in custody until he appears before an Ohio judge to give an accounting for the gold's sale and his actions. 'I don't imagine he's going to get any bond because he's already been a fugitive and knowingly evaded law enforcement,' Babtist said. 'I don't know what kind of means he has as far as money goes, but I'm sure they don't want to take any chances with him leaving the country or absconding again.'

"A high school drama teacher who allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old student told the boy that she would kill herself if he revealed their affair to anyone, according to prosecutors. Stephanie McCrea, a 35-year-old married mother-of-one from Vancouver, Washington, was taken into custody on Tuesday after the school learned about the alleged relationship earlier this month. On Wednesday, she appeared in Clark County Superior Court to be arraigned on charges of third-degree child rape, witness tampering and sexual misconduct with a minor. The boy told authorities that he met McCrea four or five times each week in her office, where they would kiss before school and after drama rehearsals, according to court documents shared by The Oregonian. In court: Teacher Stephanie McCrea makes her first appearance in Clark County Superior Court on Wednesday after she was arrested for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old boy at school and at her home . He also said that she performed a sex act on him at school before the Christmas break, and over the vacation, she allegedly collected the boy and took him to her home for sex. They then met up with other drama class students and went to a movie, with the permission of the boy's parents, according to the court documents. Once they returned to school after the break, they had sex on the campus, the boy told police. Clark County prosecutor Camara Banfield told Judge David Gregorson that McCrea had threatened to kill herself if the student revealed the alleged sex abuse, The Oregonian reported. The victim even agreed to set up fake Facebook accounts to avoid detection, she said. McCrea, an English and theater teacher at Evergreen High School, was put on administrative leave after the school learned of the alleged affair - but the sexual abuse continued, Banfield said. McCrea's attorney, Steve Thayer, said McCrea and her husband separated a month ago and that she attempted to take her life two weeks ago. He said in court documents that she started suffering mental health issues after a car accident in 2012. Judge Gregorson set her bail at $40,000 and ordered McCrea to have no contact with the boy. She is only allowed to have contact with her own child, a nine-year-old son, the judge said. Making headlines: McCrea, pictured with an article about one of her plays, taught theater and English . At work: McCrea, pictured at a rehearsal, was put on administrative leave earlier this month after the school's administrators learned about the allegations. They contacted police, who launched an investigation . She will be able to enter her plea at a formal arraignment next month. Principal Lisa Emmerich shared 'the disturbing news' of McCrea's arrest in an email to parents, reported The Columbian. Emmerich explained that as soon as administrators learned of the accusations, they contacted Vancouver police, who launched an investigation. The school continues to work with the police. McCrea was hired by the school in 2006 after passing all necessary background checks, she said. 'At this point, no other students have been identified or come forward with additional information or allegations,' her letter read. Property records listed her as living with a 34-year-old man in Vancouver. Students also told KOIN6 that she has one child. Most recently, she directed a student play called 'The Investigation' and afterwards, she took to the theatre department's Facebook play to gush about the show. 'I could not have asked for a better experience as a teacher and director. Thank you all,' she wrote. Popular: Some students voiced their support for the teacher, pictured center, following her arrest on Tuesday . Scene: McCrea, who is married with a child, joined the high school in 2006, the principal said . Some students spoke out in defense of their teacher following her arrested. 'I just can't believe this is happening,' one teenager wrote on Twitter. 'I'm so thankful for everything she has taught... Doesn't change anything.' Another, Hanna Turnbow, told KOIN6 that the teacher had always been fair. 'She's very family-oriented,' she said. 'She was always very strict about sexual harassment rules, you know, dressing rooms when we did plays and stuff. Boys are on one side, girls are on the other.' Counselors will be available to talk with students who request support, Emmerich said, and a substitute teacher is now filling in for McCrea's classes. The program's one-acts and spring musical auditions have also been canceled until further notice. She is next due in court on February 11.","Mother-of-one Stephanie McCrea was arrested on Tuesday for 'having sex at her home and at school with the 15-year-old student'

"Parents have branded a secondary school as 'lazy' after it ordered its pupils to wear name badges to class. Cambourne Village College, which opened in Cambridgeshire two years ago and has 317 pupils, introduced tags to help children get to know each other, manage behaviour and help teachers. If pupils fail to wear the colour-coded labels showing the pupils' year and initials of their tutor group, they could face a detention. Students at Cambourne Village College in Cambridgeshire have to wear name badges as part of school policy . The school's website says the badges are aimed at creating a 'family feel' and claim they 'reduce the likelihood of any child being unkind to others since everyone is identifiable.' But parents have criticised the school for not learning children's names and say the idea is 'ridiculous'. Ruth Swain, whose daughter in Year 8 has been issued with three name badges, said: 'It is the most stupid idea I have ever seen. 'I understand the school is growing and they want to keep that family feel so that everyone knows each other but it's just the height of laziness. Why can't teachers just learn the names like they always have? 'Pupils get to know each other by asking each other's name rather than reading a name badge. It could have a counter-effect. 'My daughter forgot hers and was given a stern telling off. It makes them feel like they're just machines and it's incredibly uniformed.' While other parents have taken to social media to hit out at the notion. Hasan Osman wrote: 'They should make more effort in educating them, than worrying about who has a name tag on. Ridiculous.' Vicki Rose posted on Facebook: 'Teachers should learn to remember their pupils' names or can they just not be bothered that is bloody ridiculous!' Fiona Porter added: 'It's just bloody laziness on the school's behalf. It's not a very good idea.' The Campaign for Real Education spokesman Chris McGovern said: 'This is a lazy approach, it's dreadful. 'It suggests the teachers are clearly struggling to learn the children's names despite it being half way through the year. It's very, very important that staff learn the name of the children. Pupils that fail to wear the badges could face detention. Parents have branded the coloured labels as 'lazy' 'If they can't be bothered to learn the name of the children they may as well give up teaching. 'It makes teaching impersonal and teachers are supposed to form a relationship with the pupils they teach whereas this creates distance. 'With computers creating personalised teaching there is less 'whole-class' learning and it really is a reflection of the times that teachers don't feel the need to learn the kids' names.' He also warned that the badges could encourage bullying: 'It's an intrusion into their identity and privacy and if any child walked out of school with it accidentally still on it's also a safety issue.' The school's policy is that badges, which show their first names, are left in the children's lockers overnight and not worn out of school. Sarah Smith, who has a child at the school, believes that the policy of leaving them at school is not practical. She said: 'It makes it much easier for strangers to approach children if they can see their name. I know they are expected to leave them in their lockers, but if they forget it's very worrying.' Another mother, Laura Peat, whose son is at the school, is concerned the badges could potentially be used as a weapon. 'They are extremely sharp and although they are supposed to be left at school, many children wear them home. I saw at least 20 walk past me yesterday displaying their name.' One mother, who did not wish to be named, said her 13 year-old son has been given countless detentions after making a stand against the rule. She said: 'My son wore the badge and caught it in his coat and ripped his jumper. He wont wear his and that's his decision, I have encouraged him and tried to be positive about it but he just won't wear it. 'He has had a detention break and lunchtime for the past week so has not been able to get any fresh air. The deputy head told him he is fighting a a battle he simply wont win. 'My son is quite a quiet child and doesn't want all the pupils calling his name all the time. I am happy for my son to wear the uniform and I am very strict about it, but the badge is a bit over the top.' The school, which is the most recent to open in Cambridgeshire, received its first intake in September 2013, and currently has two year groups aged 11 to 13. This year it will have an intake of 180 students and the school has been built for an eventual capacity of 750 pupils and 100 staff. Headmistress Claire Coates said students who deliberately fail to wear name badges will be 'sanctioned as for a deliberate uniform infringement'. She said: 'In keeping with many other schools, Cambourne Village College introduced identity badges for students this term. 'In our last parental survey, 97.5 per cent of parents agreed with the statement ""this school makes sure its students are well behaved"" and name badges help to encourage positive behaviour in our students and to maintain the friendly, community feel of our growing college. 'The vast majority of our students have taken to wearing an identity badge in their usual polite and cooperative fashion.' The £20 million pound building has state-of-the-art ICT, sports and performance halls, music and drama studios and large playing fields.","Cambourne Village College introduced tags to help children and teachers .

"A man who has been left with a scalp riddled with more than 50 dent-like scars after hair-loss surgery went horribly wrong has decided to go under the knife again in a bid to fix it. Graham Ryder, 51, was left with a cluster of deep scars across the top of his head following an attempted hair transplant, and electrolysis in an attempt to fix it. The electrical project manager, from East Finchley, faced many men's worst nightmare when he lost his hair at a young age. Scroll down for video . Graham was left with a cluster of deep scars across the top of his head following an attempted hair transplant . The result of a bad hair transplant and subsequent electrolysis has left Graham with 50 deep scars . 'You have to bear in mind that when I lost my hair I was 22, which was nearly 30 years ago, and that was the age of big hair,' Graham explains on Channel 5's Botched Up Bodies. 'At the time I suppose it affected me quite deeply and I was borderline desperation.' After research, Graham decided to pursue his dream of a full head of hair and booked in for a hair transplant. 'Initially the transplant seemed to work and offered a solution,' he said. 'However as my natural hair started to receded more it exposed the transplanted area, which grew in a very tufty sort of fashion, which obviously looked unsightly. 'It looked like a toothbrush. It got the point where the results of the surgery looked worse than having no surgery at all.' Graham has decided to have one last attempt at correcting the effects of the initial surgery . Graham says that the effects of his disastrous surgeries are worse than being bald . After his initial disastrous procedure, a desperate Graham tried electrolysis to remove the abnormal hair growth. However, while this did remove the tufts of hair, it has left Graham with about 50 indented scars on the top of his head. 'On a daily basis when you look in the mirror it's something that you can't avoid seeing because it's in your face. It challenges me and it does make me feel low.' Graham's partner Maria Sierra is aware of the deep psychological effect the scars have on Graham, saying: 'I know it is always in the back of his mind. It's something that bothers him quite a bit.' Dr Gregg's  series of surgeries aim to remove the deep scars and stitch them over . Although the procedure cannot remove the scars completely, they are markedly less deep and Graham hopes that further operations will improve their appearance even further . Deeply unhappy with his appearance, Graham has decided to have one last attempt at correcting the effects of the initial surgery, visiting specialist hair surgeon Dr Greg Williams. Dr Greg suggests a series of surgery that remove the deep scars and stitch them over. But the severity of his scarring means that Graham is warned he will never totally be able to remove the puck-like dimples in his scalp, and that improving them will take numerous surgeries over a two year period. However, Graham's outlook is far more positive after the first surgery. 'Obviously there is still some indentation, but it's less noticeable. I want to carry on with the surgeries and try to improve it.' See Graham's full story on Botched Up Bodies, tonight at 10pm on Channel 5 .","Bald by 22, Graham Ryder underwent a hair transplant .

"Pizza Hut is reportedly in trouble after it released a true blue Aussie pizza featuring crusts infused with Vegemite to celebrate Australia Day - without seeking permission to use the spread's iconic branding from its owner, Kraft. The pizza company promoted their quintessential Aussie pizza - combining two of the country's most loved foods: cheese and Vegemite - with great fanfare, including a TV ad featuring backpackers being appalled by the taste of Vegemite. Now Mumbrella has reported Pizza Hut never sought permission from Kraft to use the brand. Scroll down for video .

"Two female Italian councillors have embarked on an unusual quest to clamp down on illegal prostitution - by dressing up in miniskirts and confronting kerb-crawlers with a hidden camera. The stunt had been initiated by Mayor Dimitri Russo, who would stay in the background  while the two fake prostitutes waited by the road, and approach the men when they stopped.

"A teenager who weighed 414lbs has revealed how she lost half of her body weight through diet and exercise alone. Kaitlyn Smith, 19, from Portland, Oregon, shared on her website that she previously considered gastric bypass surgery, but eventually shed 208lbs with the guidance of a local health coach. Now, as part of her physical transformation, Kaitlyn plans to undergo a series of surgeries to remove the excess skin on her body. Scroll down for video .

Kaitlyn had started raising money on GoFundMe for the surgeries, which are estimated to cost $50,000. 'There is only one thing holding me back… the excess skin,' she wrote on the page. She explained that although her doctor found the skin-removal procedures 'medically necessary' because the excess flesh caused infections, back pain and pinching, her insurance provider deemed it 'cosmetic' and refused to cover the cost. 'Since I am still so young, I just want to feel beautiful in my own skin,' Kaitlyn added. 'I've come so far and proven to myself and others that it can be done.' But on hearing her story, Miami-based plastic surgeon Dr Michael Salzhauer offered to perform the procedures for free . The teen, who has raised over $7,000 in six months, will now use the money to pay for her travel expenses in Miami, where she will have to fly to and stay for two weeks after each of her three surgeries. Her first procedure with Dr Salzhauer is scheduled for February 19. Only a few years ago, Kaitlyn dreaded going out in public because of her size and often hid in her house. After battling obesity for most of her life, she began preparing to undergo gastric bypass surgery in 2012. 'The doctor was rude, and basically told me I would never look normal,' she told The Portland Leader of starting the process. 'I left crying and my parents left furious. I was really down, and scared about it all.' Kaitlyn's mother Kim Smith eventually contacted Portland health coach and trainer Kina Wald. 'Honestly, I was scared at first,' Kaitlyn recalled. 'I thought she was going to be like a drill sergeant yelling at me. I had tried so many different things - so many different diets. I thought there was no point.' Major Inspiration: Kaitlyn continues to chronicle her incredible weight loss journey on her website and Facebook page . Misdiagnosis: When she was morbidly obese, Kaitlyn (left) had considered gastric bypass surgery. She later lost the weight (right) with the help of a local health coach who focused on her diet and exercise .

She now eats every two hours to sustain her new figure (right) She noted that her parents feared she was going to die after a doctor said that he didn't think she would live to be 25 years old. Kaitlyn said Ms Wald listened to her concerns, but reminded the teen that she would have to be the one doing all the work. It was through Ms Wald that Kaitlyn learned she was eating too little. Her coach advised her to eat every two hours. She also taught Kaitlin how to monitor her nutrition and moderate certain exercises so she could complete workouts that were once too difficult. It was through Ms Wald that Kaitlyn learned she was eating too little. Her coach taught her to eat every two hours and how to moderate moves during difficult workouts. 'I was in size 32 pants. I didn't feel normal,' Kaitlyn said. 'I did not eat enough to be that way. For the first three to four months, I sent her what I was having for every meal. If I wasn't doing something right, she would tell me.' When she hit 326lbs, the teen ran and completed her first 5K race. Kaitlyn, who said Ms Wald helped her get her life back, noted that her journey has been about more than just appearance. 'It has changed me emotionally and spiritually,' she said. 'I had to learn to love myself again, and I'm more confident now.' Kaitlyn told The Tennessean that she had struggled with obesity at an early age. Although she had always been heavier than her five siblings, she began rapidly gaining weight when she was four years old. When she was eight years old, she realized that she couldn't keep up with the other kids her age.

Now she is no longer ashamed to be seen in public (right) New beginnings: The teen, who had been struggling with obesity since she was four-years-old, said losing the weight has helped her to get her life back on track . Role model: Kaitlyn dreaded leaving the house when she was morbidly obese (left), but now she proudly snaps selfies of her new body (right) following her physical transformation . Kaitlyn's parents sought the help of a nutritionist, but their daughter continued to gain an average of 3lbs a week. 'We tried to monitor her, but she just kept gaining weight,' Mrs Smith told the outlet. 'The pediatrician couldn't understand why. Her thyroid gland and bloods tests came normal.' Kaitlyn eventually stopped eating breakfast and lunch because she was worried that others would watch and make fun of her. She tried to avoid overindulging in home-cooked Southern dinners, but by middle school she had weighed 200lbs. Kaitlyn said she hated going to gym class, and would get changed in the bathroom stalls. Her peers started to make fun of her 'pigeon walk'. She explained that she even started to make fun of herself as a coping mechanism. At 13, she could no longer fit in a single seat on a roller coaster. She stopped going out to eat with friends because was unable to squeeze into restaurant booths. Her weight made walking difficult, and she could only fit into one pair of jeans during her freshman year of high school. Kaitlyn soon started being home-schooled along with her younger sister Kristen, who suffers from migraines. At her heaviest, she was wearing size 32 pants and 4XL shirts. 'I dreaded going in public because I was afraid someone would see me,' she recalled. 'I started avoiding mirrors, and if I saw myself, I told myself how disgusting I was.' After losing half of her body weight and learning to love herself again, she said that she is determined to help others to do the same. 'People told me I was the reason they're in the gym,' she said. 'People call me a hero, inspiration and superwoman. That pushes me even more.'","Kaitlyn Smith, 19, once weighed 414lbs and says her weight loss has changed her 'emotionally and spiritually'

Rubio, 43, is considering a possible presidential run and the incident took place at a 'Team Marco 2016' summit on Saturday morning, where he was speaking to 300 of his top donors and supporters at the Delano Hotel in South Beach. His wife of 16 years, Jeanette Dousdebes Rubio, accidentally crashed the family SUV into a parked Porsche as she dropped the senator off at the event. Scroll down for video . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (pictured right) and his wife Jeanette (left). She accidentally hit one of his donor's cars over the weekend - a $78,000 Porsche Panamera. Luckily, the unnamed donor did not want to file a report . Page Six reported Mrs Rubio had driven the family's Ford pickup truck to the hotel, but as she drove up the entrance ramp she got too close to a guest's Porsche Panamera and scraped it. The website reported that damage to both cars was 'minimal' and no one was hurt. The owner of the Porsche, which retails for around $78,000, is believed to be a Rubio supporter who was attending the event. Although Rubio hasn't officially declared his candidacy, he  is doing well in opinion polls among Republican voters, particularly women . One of the hotel's valets called the police, who confirmed an incident had taken place and added that the parties declined to file a report. Mrs Rubio, 40, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, is now a stay-at-home mom to the couple's four children and runs a weekly Bible study group. Although Rubio hasn't officially declared his candidacy, he has heightened his profile in recent weeks for admonishing the Obama administration over its Cuba policy. Reports suggest he has leaped to front of the 2016 pack among Republican voters, with a recent poll putting him in second place in the GOP primary, just behind Mitt Romney and level with Jeb Bush. Rubio polled at 13 percent - just three points behind front-runner Romney. Among women, he came in first, earning 22 percent of female respondents' support. Saturday's event kicked off a week-long campaign effort. The Senate seat Rubio holds is due for review in 2016, and the Republican politician has said he won't ask Florida voters to re-elect him if he runs for president. He has until May to decide. Rubio suggested last week that he is still mulling over his options. But an adviser told ABC, 'he has told us to proceed as if he is running for president.'","Florida Senator Marco Rubio, 43, was attending a 'Team Marco 2016' event .

"A wrong-way driver who smashed into a 26-year-old mother of two young boys, killing her, was nearly four times the legal driving limit at the time, according to police. Stephen Martin, 39, told Arizona Department of Public Safety officials that he knew he was drunk and shouldn't have been driving at the time of the crash on Tuesday morning. As he drove on Interstate 17 with a 38-year-old female passenger at 1am, he crashed into Megan Lange's car as the young mother headed home following a shift as a fire department dispatcher. Lange, a married mother to two sons, six-month-old Miles and two-year-old Sean, had just returned to work at the Phoenix Fire Department following maternity leave. Loss: Megan Lange, pictured with her husband Patrick and their sons, two-year-old Sean and six-month-old Miles, died after her car was hit by a drunk wrong-way driver as she drove home from work on Tuesday . She was rushed to hospital and clung to life for nearly 15 hours but was taken off life support just before 4pm on Tuesday, the Arizona Republic reported. Martin and his passenger both survived the crash with minor injuries. Another motorist whose car was sideswiped in the collision was also treated for minor injuries. Martin had a blood-alcohol level of .313 at the time of the crash, DPS said, the Arizona Republic reported. The legal limit is .08. When officers arrived on the scene, they found Martin lying behind his damaged SUV. He confirmed the vehicle was his, that he had been going the wrong way and that he had been drinking. His female passenger said she had told him that they were going the wrong way but couldn't find a place to turn around on the interstate. She estimated that they were driving 40 to 45 mph, according to court records. A Department of Public Safety officer said he noticed the white Chevrolet SUV driving southbound in the northbound lanes and outmaneuvered into a position to slow northbound traffic behind him, but Martin drove around him, sidewiped one car and then smashed into Lage's SUV, DPS said. Thoughtless: Stephen Martin, left, told officers immediately after the crash that he had been drinking and his blood alcohol level was found to be nearly four times the legal limit. Mrs Lange, right, died 15 hours later . Happy: Mrs Lange had joined the fire department in 2009 and worked as a dispatcher. Colleagues remembered the young mother as a caring, professional worker and a proud mother to her two young sons . Lange was on her way home from her shift at the time, Captain Mark Vanacore, a Phoenix Fire Department spokesman, said. 'She was a professional,' said Jim Frazier, her supervisor and her husband's uncle. 'She not only delivered babies over the phone, she helped save many lives.' He added that she had been driven to join the department by a desire to help people. She joined the department in 2009, he said. 'We are a tight family,' he said. 'We love each other deeply and we're going to come together and find meaning in this.' Martin remains jailed on suspicion of second-degree murder and other crimes. He appeared in court on Wednesday and his defense attorney Vicki Lopez said the case resulted from an 'unintentional act'. Speaking to ABC15, Martin's father claimed that his son got behind the wheel when he was drunk because he was trying to help his former girlfriend - the female passenger - after she called him saying a man had raped her and was stalking her. Scene: Martin, who had a passenger, swerved around a Department of Public Safety officer who was trying to protect other cars from the approaching wrong-way driver and slammed into Mrs Lange's car . Wreck: Martin, who claims he was driving a woman to get away from a stalker, and his passenger escaped the crash with minor injuries. His wrecked vehicle is pictured on Interstate 17 following the crash . Martin picked the woman up and the alleged attacker started trailing them, his father said. 'He still doesn't know how it happened,' the unidentified man told ABC. 'He made a wrong turn, got on the freeway, because he was looking in the rear-view mirror. He was literally scared for his life.' The man said he did not condone his son's decision to drive, but added: 'Hopefully the family will find it in their hearts at some point to forgive him and understand.' It was not the first time Martin had been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, records show. In 2006, he was arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana and pleaded guilty to possession or use of marijuana. He was sentenced to a year of probation. The Lange family has set up a gofundme page, which can be found here.

"A Grade II-listed Elizabethan house has been transformed into a swingers' club complete with a fetish dungeon advertising 'leather and lace' parties. Stratford House in Highgate, Birmingham, was built in 1601, for local landowner Ambrose Rotton and his wife Bridget. The beautiful manor house was originally part of a 20-acre farm. But now the timber framed property is being advertised online under the name Tudor Lounge and porn stars are listed as being regulars at 'adult themed events'. Stratford House, in Highgate, Birmingham, has been transformed into a swingers' club complete with a fetish dungeon advertising 'leather and lace' parties . It is understood the current tenants signed a ten-year lease for the building with current owner, Benjamin Jackson, last March. The Tudor Lounge website claims to be the UK's most exclusive swingers venue and pictures of scantily clad women are featured, including UK porn stars. It talks up the history of the building, calling it 'a magnificent Tudor timber oak mansion built in 1601. 'The building has been fully refurbished with only one thing in mind – your pleasure and enjoyment,' reads the website. 'Come and join in our parties or contact us to organize your own. Our facilities are amongst the most impressive you will find in any UK club. The parties will be well attended but totally pressure free, making them ideal for your first visit or experienced swingers alike.' Birmingham City Council granted temporary change of use planning permission for 'the private members meeting venue' last year and says there were no complaints raised at the time . The beautiful manor house was originally part of a 20-acre farm. But now the timber framed property is being advertised online under the name Tudor Lounge . Porn stars are listed as being regulars at 'adult themed events' at the beautiful manor house, which was originally part of a 20-acre farm . Couples pay up to £15 or receive free entry to events, while single females receive mostly free entrance, according to the website . The website lists a string of events including a burlesque swingers night last Friday and a 'leather and lace' swingers event planned for this Friday. The site states club membership is free but the parties charge entry fees for men ranging from £40 to £75. Couples pay up to £15 or receive free entry to events, while single females receive mostly free entrance, according to the website. Visitors can also hire the venue for their own events at £250 for midweek or afternoon bookings, or £300 for Friday or Saturdays. The website states: 'Our aim is to provide you with a truly fantastic experience, setting a whole new standard for swinging venues in the UK.' Birmingham City Council granted temporary change of use planning permission for 'the private members meeting venue' last year and says there were no complaints raised at the time. But some residents claim they were not consulted, and have urged the council to investigate the house in Stratford Place, which backs onto the playing fields of Calthorpe School and a public park. One of the bedrooms inside the property includes a large double bed flanked by mirrors, and a generously proportioned jacuzzi . Another of the rooms includes what appears to be a leather bed and fluorescent lighting . A red leather banquette lies behind sheer drapes in a discreet corner of the listed home . Visitors can also hire the venue for their own events at £250 for midweek or afternoon bookings, or £300 for Friday or Saturdays . One local said: 'I simply can't understand how this could have been allowed to happen in a listed building in an area of regeneration. 'Surely they have to have planning permission. And surely, if so, there should have been public consultation in the area. Nobody asked us about sex clubs.' A club spokesman defended the use of the building – and insisted that the council knew about the use. 'The council was informed about it all and it was the council that used the label swingers club,' he said. 'We have a long-term lease and have had no complaints. 'We are 15ft from the carriageway and the nearest neighbour is 60m away. All our windows are covered, so no-one can see anything from the outside.' When asked about the complaints about such an historic property being used for swinging, he said: 'People should mind their own business. Do I go round to their house to see what is going on in there?' The bathrooms inside are also generously proportioned - with two showers for communal bathing . The website lists a string of events including a burlesque swingers night last Friday and a 'leather and lace' swingers event planned for this Friday . When asked if sex takes place at the property, he said: 'Sometimes. We are consenting adults. 'More people are involved in swinging than care to admit it. 'Are you going to go round closing down the brothels in Birmingham?' The spokesman claimed some of the details on the website were inaccurate, but refused to say which ones. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council initially issued a statement which said: 'According to our records, the Tudor Lounge is not licensed by Birmingham City Council, but we will be investigating whether any activities that would require a licence take place at this premises.' Once called Camp Hill Farm, Stratford House was built in 1601 for Ambrose Rotton and his wife Bridget . The beautiful manor house was originally part of a 20-acre plot farmed by yeoman Ambrose who kept sheep, cows and pigs . After being asked about the planning permission claims of the club, a second council statement followed. 'Planning approved a temporary change of use for Stratford House, from office use to a private members meeting venue, for up to one year on 11 April 2014. 'As part of this process, site and press notices were issued and ward members, residents associations and neighbouring premises/residents were consulted, but no responses were lodged. 'The council has not received any complaints in relation to this premises or activities reported to take place. 'Any planning application would be assessed against national and local planning policy, as a private members' club. The temporary consent was given in order for the local planning authority (BCC) to assess any impacts on amenity in the local residential area. 'Licensing officers will be investigating whether any licensable activities, such as the sale of alcohol, take place at this premises, as our records currently show that the Tudor Lounge is not licensed by Birmingham City Council.' Once called Camp Hill Farm, Stratford House was built in 1601 for Ambrose Rotton and his wife Bridget. The beautiful manor house was originally part of a 20-acre plot farmed by yeoman Ambrose who kept sheep, cows and pigs. The house was owned by the family - after whom Rotton Park in Edgbaston is  named - until 1696 and then by the Simcoxes until 1926 when the LMS Railway Company bought it, along with surrounding land. The railway firm initially threatened to demolish the property because it wanted to expand its goods station at Camp Hill. Prompted by the Civic Society, the Education Department put forward a proposal to turn Stratford House into a school for the deaf. But financing problems saw that deal fall through, although Stratford House was saved and remained as LMS offices until 1946, when the railway moved out, In August 1950 the house was officially listed as an ancient monument under the Town & Country Planning Act, giving it official protection. Ownership details have remained vague since the 1950s, but it was bought by an Ivon Adams, who restored the property to its full glory. By the 1980s the address was providing office accommodation to Network Records, a techno music production company who stayed there until the 1990s. Benjamin Jackson was the last named owner of Stratford House according to Land Registry documents which confirm a ten-year lease was signed with an unnamed party on March 7, 2014.","Stratford House, Highgate, built in 1601, for landowner Ambrose Rotton .

The tournament kicks off on February 6 and concludes on March 21, when the new trophy will be lifted for the first time. England captain Chris Robshaw, meanwhile, believes a winning start against Wales will be crucial to success in the tournament. 'Going down to Cardiff is huge for England, it's one of the terrific stadiums in world rugby so it's a great place to go and play,' said Robshaw. 'Every team wants to go and win the tournament - you don't want to fall at the first hurdle, you want to get off to a winning start and go from there. 'All the attention is on that first game.' Wales, who lost 29-18 to England at Twickenham in last year's tournament, endured a disappointing Autumn Series but drew encouragement from a 12-6 victory over South Africa in their final game. 'After the November series, a lot of the lads' attention turned straight to the England game,' said Wales captain Sam Warbuton. 'Two months seems a long time but there's already been a lot of focus and build-up to the match. 'The players sense that from the media and the public. Walking around Cardiff, it's what everyone is looking forward to. 'It's being thrown straight into the deep end, I quite like that. 'Playing England first up is brilliant. It's one of the biggest games we play in as a player and for those guys involved it will be a big milestone in their career.'

"A new report investigating the impact of economic factors on expanding waistlines has found the popularity of Wal-Mart Supercenters and other warehouse clubs to be the single biggest contributor to the nation's weight gain. The National Bureau of Economic Research's working paper - entitled Can Changing Economic Factors Explain the Rise in Obesity? - investigated the impact of economic factors such as the cost of food on obesity. According to the report, people weighed more when the cost of calories decreased — which explained 36.5 percent of total BMI gains. A new report investigating the impact of economic factors on expanding waistlines has found the popularity of supercenters and warehouse clubs - including Wal-Mart - to be the single biggest contributor to weight gain . The density of an area’s supercenters and warehouse clubs significantly affected the obesity rate, according to the study. Opening an additional store per 100,000 residents increased an area’s average body mass index by 0.24 units, or 10.8 percent of the sample obesity rate, the study found. The overall effect: 'These estimates imply that the proliferation of Wal-Mart Supercenters explains 10.5 percent of the rise in obesity since the late 1980s.' Additional economic factors to blame for the obesity crisis included more restaurants, rising cigarette prices and fewer blue-collar jobs. These variables combined, controlled for demographics, explain 37 percent of the increase in Body Mass Index in the U.S. from 1990 to 2010, as well as 59 percent of the rise in severe obesity, the paper found. 'We live in an environment with increasingly cheap and readily available junk food,' Charles Courtemanche, assistant professor of economics at Georgia State University, told the Washington Post. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that supercenters, followed by restaurants, as the economic factor with the biggest influence on expanding waistlines . 'We buy in bulk. We tend to have more food around. It takes more and more discipline and self-control to not let that influence your weight.' Courtemanche co-authored the working paper with the University of Louisville's Joshua Pinkston, Christopher Ruhm of the University of Virginia, and the University of Iowa's George Wehby. Lower BMI results meanwhile were found to correlate with factors such as fitness-center expansion and increases in gas prices. Obesity rates have more than doubled in adults and children since the 1970's. While recent estimates suggest that the overall rates of obesity have plateaued or even declined among some groups, obesity is widespread and continues to be a leading public health problem in the U.S. More than one-third - 34.9 percent or 78.6 million - of U.S. adults are obese. Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death. The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars; the medical costs for people who are obese were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight. The proliferation of Wal-Mart Supercenters explains 10.5 percent of the rise in obesity since the late 1980s claims the new report . This isn't the first report to link obesity to Walmart. A study published in the March 2011 issue of the Journal of Urban Economics found that obesity levels increased wherever a Wal-mart Supercenter opened. The research 'tracked extensive health and population data between 1996 and 2005'. They focused on areas of the U.S. where Walmart Supercenters moved in, providing the communities with access to lots of low-cost food. 'The researchers found that one new Walmart Supercentre per 100,000 residents meant an average weight gain of 1.5 pounds per person sometime over a 10-year period dating from the store's opening,' the story says. 'It also boosted the obesity rate by 2.3 percentage points, meaning that for every 100 people, two who weren't obese ended up in that category after a superstore opened.'","New report by the National Bureau of Economic Research looked impact of economic factors on obesity .

"American fashion label Abercrombie and Fitch has been accused of defacing its store on London's prestigious Savile Row after painting one of the upstairs rooms brown. The leisure-wear chain met with protests when it announced it was moving to the Grade II listed store in London's upmarket Mayfair in 2013. And now tailors from the surrounding boutiques have accused the brand of defacing the store after they painted a first floor room brown. Abercrombie and Fitch has been accused of defacing this Grade II listed building on Savile Row after tailors on the exclusive street say they painted an upstairs room brown without the colour being agreed on . The conditions attached to a Grade II listed building mean that any colour scheme on the ground or first floor must be agreed with the council before going ahead (stock images of Abercrombie interior) Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told that the conditions of Grade II status meant that any colour scheme on either the ground or first floor had to be agreed with the council beforehand. Court papers accuse Abercrombie of breaching this condition on March 24 last year at their 3 Savile Row shop. Protesters have long objected to the Ambercrombie Store, saying its all-American leisure clothing is out of keeping with the famously upmarket street of largely British tailors. Prosecutor Warwick Tatford, on behalf of Westminster Council, asked for a delay so a senior barrister could review the case. He said: ‘It’s a complicated matter and needs to be looked at in the round, and which companies are the appropriate defendants. ‘We also need to consider the merits of the case, which involve a certain amount of artistic judgement that involves looking at the painting of walls.’ The fashion chain's Savile Row store has long been the source of criticism, as people feel its all-American leisurewear is out of keeping with the upmarket, traditionally British boutiques on the street . He said the barrister for the prosecution was currently ill, but added: ‘It is hard to anticipate a trial, either the case will be withdrawn, which is unlikely, or there will be a guilty plea with potential substantial mitigation.’ Abercrombie and Fitch are in the dock along with with Dorset based Castletech Construction. They both face the same charge of failing to comply with a condition in a listed building contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. If convicted, they face a maximum £20,000 fine. Magistrates adjourned the case until March 25 for further assessment of the case. Both companies have yet to enter a plea.","Abercrombie accused of defacing Grade II listed shop at 3 Savile Row .

Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson is gearing up to go head-to-head with selfie superfan Chloe Madeley, supermodel Jodie Kidd and former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts on the show. What will no doubt help Louise is the £1,000 of beauty treatments, including a a fat-freezing beauty treatment to tone her thighs that she revealed she had. Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson had £1,000 worth of beauty treatments - including fat freezing . The 23-year-old Edinburgh University graduate had a 90-minute Lipoglaze treatment on her inner thighs in her strive for a 'thigh gap'. Louise appeared on the show this week looking svelte and slender for her photocall in the mountains in Innsbruck, Austria, alongside other female contestants including Stacey Solomon, Louise Hazel, Heather Mills and Lady Victoria Hervey. Louise had a 90-minute Lipoglaze treatment on her inner thighs in the hope that they would look toned . Louise looking svelte and slender for her photocall in the mountains in her Lycra . After having the non-invasive treatment, the size 8 brunette tweeted: 'Feeling super skinny thanks to ‪@LoveLiteUk ‪#thighgap coming along nicely' Ironically, given that she will be spending the next few weeks in sub-zero temperatures, the treatment that she had back in 2013 worked by freezing her fatty tissues down to minus eight degrees. At that temperature, fat cells apparently crystallise and die and then waste away naturally. One 60-minute treatment claims to reduce fat by up to 33 per cent and results can start to show after a week and will be complete by around eight weeks, claims the company. After having the non-invasive treatment the size 8 brunette tweeted: 'Feeling super skinny thanks to ‪@LoveLiteUk ‪#thighgap coming along nicely.' Prices for the lipoglaze treatment at the LoveLite clinic in Harley Street start at £600 but go up to £800 for a 45-minute procedure on two treatment areas, like Louise had on both thighs. She also visited a celebrity facialist last year, who recommended she try out a £185 facial to reduce fine lines . She opted to have a series of 60-minute anti-ageing Skinbreeze facials to beat her wrinkles . Strictly Come Dancing star Kristina Rihanoff, Apprentice runner-up Luisa Zissman and TOWIE’s Tom Pearce have also trialled the treatment. Louise wasn't stopping at just the fat freezing; she also opted to have a series of 60-minute anti-ageing Skinbreeze facials. She visited celebrity facialist Debbie Thomas in Knightsbridge, who recommended she try out the £185 facial to reduce fine lines and plump skin. Louise is certainly keen to get stuck into the show and recently joked, 'Love getting to the mountain before the lifts are open.' Other famous faces joining her on the piste will be Gogglebox's resident posh tippler Dom Parker, Zara Phillips' rugby star husband Mike Tindall, Jackass star Steve-O and former JLS singer JB Gill. The 16 contestants have already begun training and will have to tackle events such as bobsleigh, slalom and ski cross. But before even landing a place in the contest, they must complete a skeleton run, with the fastest racers directly qualifying while the others will be involved in a live ski jump. Those who achieve the shortest distances will have to sit out as substitutes. The treatment pumps serum deep into the lower layers of the skin, plumping and smoothing any lines in the skin as well as promoting hydration .","Louise, 23, had fat-freezing and facials that cost £985 .

An earlier version of this article stated that Louise Thompson had the beauty treatment ahead of her appearance on TV programme The Jump because she was self-conscious about her appearance and in the hope that she would look toned and slim in the skin-tight Lycra jumpsuit she would be hearing on the show. We are happy to clarify that Ms Thompson had the treatment over a year ago and long before she knew she would be engaged on the TV programme."
"These images show the disgusting hygiene standards at a Chinese restaurant run by an owner who has been convicted three times for having filthy kitchen conditions. Shek Kwok, 60, was handed a life ban for selling food after he admitted a string of serious hygiene charges relating to the Oriental Cuisine restaurant in Brantham, near Ipswich, Suffolk. When council workers arrived at the restaurant on January 9 last year they were horrified to discover surfaces and floors were unclean while crispy seaweed was sitting in a dirty microwave. Disgusting: A bowl of crispy seaweed was found lying in a dirty microwave at the Oriental Cuisine restaurant . Filthy: Council workers were horrified to discover surfaces and floors were unclean, pictured is a mouldy chopping board . A fridge door was damaged and dirty and cardboard was being used to repair the problem, Ispwich Crown Court heard. The team also found there was a danger of cross-contamination between two sinks, a dirty washing up rack with packaged food, open raw eggshells and pieces of battered chicken on it. One of the wash basins was full of water with droplets of oil on the surface, blocked by rubber gloves, a floor grate was also damaged. Rice in a half-open hot cupboard was tested and found to be at a temperature between 50C and 53C when it should have been kept at 63C. Shek Kwok, 60, admitted seven serious hygiene offences at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday . There was an outbreak of dangerous salmonella food poisoning at the same restaurant in 2002 when it was called the Szechuan Inn. The incident resulted in successful civil claims by customers affected which ended with payouts by the restaurant's insurers. In 2004 Kwok and his company were each fined £700 and ordered to pay costs for offences under two sections of the Food Safety Act. At the same restaurant in 2008, he breached three food hygiene offences and again had to pay fines and costs totalling more than £16,000. Following this third incident, which involved seven charges, recorder Simon Blackford made him subject to an indefinite hygiene prohibition order and gave him a community order with a three-month curfew from 9pm to 2am. Kwok, of Colchester, Essex, was also ordered to pay £750 costs and £60 to the victims' fund. Recorder Blackford said he knew that he was depriving Kwok of his livelihood but he stressed that due to his history and attitude he had to act because he posed a real danger to the public. After the hearing, Vincent Dréau, a Food and Safety Officer for Babergh District Council which brought the prosecution, said: 'The sentence imposed on Mr Kwok today reflects not only the poor standards found on the premises last January, but the consistently poor levels of hygiene over several years. 'Over the years we have worked hard to help Mr Kwok achieve an adequate standard of food safety but he has failed to take advice or properly act on recommendations made.'

"This is the shocking moment a thug viciously grabbed an elderly lollipop man and shoved him to the floor before running off with his sign. Dramatic CCTV footage of the incident shows the 82-year-old victim being attacked after he walked out to stop traffic on a busy road in Coventry. The dedicated lollipop man, who travels 10 miles every day to help out at the school crossing and who has manned the street for the last 14 years, has now been left too traumatised to return to the position. Scroll down for video . Police have released dramatic CCTV footage of the shocking incident which shows the suspect (circled left) approaching the lollipop man (far right), before grabbing him and throwing him to the ground in Coventry . The suspect approached the lollipop man (pictured) as he stopped traffic on a busy Coventry road last week . The suspect can be seen grabbing hold of the lollipop man before leading him back towards the pavement . The 20-second video clip shows the suspect, who is dressed in dark clothing with a hood up, standing on the pavement as the lollipop man walks out into the road. However, instead of crossing the road, the suspect then strides towards his victim and grabs him before dragging him back onto the pavement. When the lollipop man refuses to give up his beloved sign, the suspect pushes him to the floor and yanks the stick out of his hand before running off. Three young women can then be seen running to the aid of the victim who lies helplessly on the floor. Police said the pensioner was left with injuries to his left side following the incident, and is too scared to return to the streets. The man, who does not wish to be named, had proudly patrolled various school sites across Coventry for the last 14 years and is a familiar face to hundreds of youngsters and parents. Police said he was attacked because he refused to give up his 'treasured crossing sign'. However, officers also revealed that the man had since been reunited with his sign after a kind-hearted passer-by managed to confront the suspect and retrieve it. West Midlands Police said the mystery stranger spotted a man getting out of a blue Vauxhall Vectra car with the lollipop stick and confronted him before getting the sign back. Officers would now like to speak to the suspect who carried out the 'callous robbery' at 4.38pm on January 21. Detective Inspector Gareth Mason, of Coventry Investigation Team, said: 'The pensioner has done this job for over 14 years and he was not prepared to just hand over his treasured crossing sign. 'He refused to let go and ended up in a struggle with his assailant, ultimately leading to the robber pushing his elderly victim to the floor before running off with the lollipop stick. 'This is a particularly senseless offence against an elderly man, who is carrying out a public duty. 'Since the attack, the victim has been too distressed and shaken by what happened to return to work − something that has devastated him after so many years of devoted service. 'He also suffered injuries to his left side as a result of the fall. It is only through fortune that the injuries were not more serious. 'We are determined to identify the offender and request the help of the local community or anybody who witnessed the offence.' The suspect, dressed in dark clothing and with a hood up, drags the helpless victim towards the road side . The offender then grabs the lollipop sign out of his victim's hand and shoves him, prompting the victim to fall . The lollipop man (dressed in high visibility clothing) can be seen falling to the floor as the suspect runs off . Three young girls came to the aid of the helpless lollipop man and police now wish to speak to the suspect . Residents living in Humber Road, where the attack occurred, have expressed their shock at the brutal attack. Teaching assistant John Neal, 32, said: 'It is so awful that a lollipop man can be attacked in such an unprovoked and savage way. 'The city doesn't have many lollipop men or women left so the fact the old guy was out there helping people cross the road is testament to his caring nature. 'The scumbag who did this should be strung up. What on earth will they do with a lollipop stick? It's probably only worth a few pounds and who the hell would buy it?' West Midlands Police has released the CCTV as part of attempts to trace the suspect, and a force spokesman added: 'We would like to speak to this person in connection with a callous robbery of an elderly lollipop man.' The offender is described as a white man, around 6ft 2in tall, of athletic build, in his late 20s to early 30s, with bushy or thick hair. He was wearing dark clothing. Anyone who has any information about the robbery is urged to call West Midlands Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"French lawyer Frank Samson, 47, who is set to play Napoleon, said the French dictator was the real hero of Waterloo, despite suffering a crushing defeat . It is not so much a bid to rewrite history as a blatant attempt at match-rigging. For the French are claiming that Napoleon – not Wellington – was the true hero of Waterloo. In a reconstruction to mark this year’s bicentenary of the battle, they plan to ignore the fact that he emerged utterly defeated. Instead, they want to portray the French emperor as the winner over a ‘frightful’ English nobody. But the sabre-rattling ahead of the commemorations in Belgium this summer was quickly dismissed by historians. The first salvo was fired by French lawyer Frank Samson, who will play Napoleon in the re-enactment. The 47-year-old, taking massive liberties with history, claimed that while Napoleon was ‘one of the greatest men the world has ever known’, the Duke of Wellington – who led the Allied army to a famous victory – was a ‘frightful Englishman that no one has heard of’. He added: ‘In terms of public relations, in terms of his historical importance, it’s clear that [Napoleon] won at Waterloo. The public will acclaim him and we have forgotten that he lost.’ However, historian and broadcaster James Holland said Mr Samson’s views were ‘clearly very stupid’. He said: ‘The fact is that Napoleon lost at Waterloo, and not only was that the end of his military career, it was the end of his political career as well. 'On the other hand, Wellington’s military career was enhanced by Waterloo and his political career began and he went on to be Prime Minister of Great Britain. 'Napoleon was a dictator whose actions caused the death of hundreds of thousands. Wellington was merely trying to stop a murderous despot from taking over Europe. ‘There’s no question Napoleon’s stature and influence in the world was enormous. But it could be argued his legacy to France has not been 100 per cent helpful, whereas on the back of Wellington we became the greatest empire the world has ever known.’ Taking large liberties with historical fact, Mr Samson claimed Napoleon was 'one of the greatest men the world has ever known', while Nelson was 'a frightful Englishman no one has heard of' Saul David, professor of military history at the University of Buckingham, said the French disdain for Wellington – ‘one of the two or three greatest generals in history’ – may be because he was leading an allied army containing not only British but also Dutch and Prussians. The 200th anniversary of Waterloo, on June 18, will be marked by a two-day re-enactment on the battlefield, just south of Brussels, with 5,000 soldiers, 300 horses and 100 cannon. Wellington will be played by New Zealander Alan Larsen, 54. Chief organiser Etienne Claude denied that Napoleon would emerge as the victor, saying: ‘We’re not mad enough for that.’ And Mr Samson, who has played Napoleon in 189 reconstructions of Waterloo, admitted: ‘I’ve lost every time.’","Lawyer set to play French dictator calls him 'one of world's greatest men'

Noordhuizen is seven months into her pregnancy and suffered minor injuries, The Tampa Bay Times reported on Tuesday. Citing an arrest report, the newspaper said Noordhuizen claimed the couple had a dispute and she took off - and claimed Colby told her in a phone call 'Are you ready for your abortion date?'

Colby returned to his nearby home and took off on his motorcycle, the Florida Highway Patrol told the newspaper. Witness Jessica Austin told WSPA 'All I could hear was, him screaming ""Oh no, Oh no, Oh no."" 'And I ran outside and he was running out and, um, he's like ""I know I'm going to jail, I know I'm going to jail."" And I started screaming at him.

"OFSTED inspectors who grilled pupils on 'British values' have been accused of asking a young girl at a Christian school whether she was a virgin. The pupil, aged around 12, was allegedly asked the invasive question when inspectors visited Durham Free School. The extraordinary claim emerged as MPs questioned Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw, who flatly denied the allegation. He told the education select committee he had conducted a 'thorough' investigation into claims children were asked inappropriate questions and found them to be false. Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw defended the way inspections are carried out to check that schools are teaching 'British values' Ariella Wilkinson, 10, says she came home in tears after being questioned by Ofsted inspectors about lesbians. Her mother Lena said the questioning was 'completely inappropriate' But last night the chairman of Durham Free School's board of governors indicated that it was taking the allegation involving the young girl seriously, saying: 'There is something in it.' John Denning added that it was 'clearly the case that inspectors are asking questions that most people would think of as inappropriate for the age'. And he accused Sir Michael of making himself 'a hostage to fortune' by denying there was a problem. Parents branded the Chief Inspector 'condescending' and complained he had not spoken to them or taken their concerns seriously. Durham Free School is set to close after inspectors branded children 'intolerant' in a disastrous Ofsted report which also pointed out failures in teaching and attainment. Parents say their children, aged 11 to 13, were asked 'inappropriate' questions about gay people, Muslims and sex. Some pupils were allegedly asked whether there were any gay children in their class. It is one of a number of schools who say they are falling victim to the Government's new British Values drive, which requires all schools to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles. Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland has been put in special measures after children were branded intolerant. Labour MP Alex Cunningham warned that some of the parents claim that Ofsted has 'got it in for Christian schools' Yesterday, Alex Cunningham, Labour MP for Stockton North, said he had been 'inundated' with emails and letters from parents at Durham Free School. He suggested families felt there was a political agenda and that 'Ofsted had got it in for Christian schools'. 'Some parents claim that there were some inappropriate approaches to the inspection,' he said. 'A Member of Parliament said to me last night that one parent had claimed that a girl was even asked if she was a virgin. Is that something you would investigate?' Sir Michael replied: 'We have investigated those allegations and those allegations are false. We've spent a long time looking at this.' But he did admit that inspectors may ask children whether they call each other 'gay' or 'lesbo'. Sir Michael replied: 'I can't imagine an inspector asking those sorts of questions. If any inspector behaved inappropriately they would be dealt with very severely by Ofsted.' The chairman of Durham Free School's board of governors indicated that it was taking the allegation involving the young girl seriously, saying: 'There is something in it' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has insisted students should be taught about values such as tolerance, respect, democracy and the rule of law regardless of faith or cultural alignment . Yesterday, parents at both schools denied there was homophobic bullying and called for Sir Michael to investigate their complaints properly. Dr Tim Dunnett, 36, who has four children at Grindon Hall, said: 'We feel that Ofsted's response to our concerns is patronising. 'Michael Wilshaw is adamant he has made a full investigation, but how can this be when he has not spoken to any of the staff or parents involved and addressed our concerns?' Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: 'Parents are disappointed Ofsted has not taken their allegations seriously.' Last summer, the Government announced all schools will be required to teach British values following the Trojan Horse controversy over Islamist attempts to infiltrate schools. The drive has been backed by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, dubbed Ms U-Turn. By Matt Chorley, Political Editor For MailOnline . Dozens of primary school pupils a year are suspended for being drunk or high on drugs, figures reveal. Every week in term time at least one exclusion order is imposed on an under-11 for offences including alcohol abuse or drug dealing. At secondary school the situation is worse still, with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that teachers are losing the battle against substance abuse. Figures released in Parliament this week show that in 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs. The Department for Education said this included alcohol abuse, drug dealing, inappropriate use of prescribed drugs, possession of illegal drugs, smoking and substance abuse. There are 39 weeks in the average term, meaning one pupil aged five-11 is suspended every week. Tory MP Andrew Griffiths, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline: 'The striking thing is that 40 primary school children have been excluded because they turned up drunk or high. 'It is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence. 'We do have to ask what is happening to the parents of these children and are they being prosecuted. Clearly they are getting the drugs and alcohol from somewhere.' The figures show that there were 6,590 drink and drug related fixed period suspensions in secondary schools in 2012-13, the latest year for which figures are available. Another 360 exclusions were imposed, where students were removed from the school permanently, accounting for one in ten of all expulsions. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Prohibited items including alcohol and drugs have no place whatsoever in the classroom. 'We have introduced a range of powers for teachers to ensure discipline, behaviour and safety are maintained. 'Our guidance on behaviour clarifies what head teachers can do to properly discipline disruptive pupils and frees up teachers' time and energy.'","Sir Michael Wilshaw insists claims of inappropriate questions are untrue .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury says vicars should avoid preaching 'moral claptrap' about being nice in their sermons adding Christianity's message is as radical as a call for violent revolution. Speaking at an event in New York City, where he delivered a homily, the Most Reverend Justin Welby called on people to 'get their hands dirty' if they are to tackle inequality in society. He said that the old sermons he often heard while growing up England, all urged people to be nice, but he explained that Jesus wouldn't allow his followers to accept this given that the 'weak' are often excluded from society. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, who says vicars should avoid preaching 'moral claptrap' about being nice as Christianity's message is as radical as a call for 'violent revolution' Mr Welby also explained that the message of Christianity could be mistaken for a call to 'violent revolution' if it wasn't for the religion's emphasis on peace. He was visiting New York to speak at the 'Creating Common Good' conference organised by the Trinity Institute at Trinity Church on the city's Wall Street in the heart of the financial district. In a speech, published online by Lambeth Palace, he told the congregation: 'Jesus does not permit us to accept a society in which the weak are excluded, whether because of race, wealth, gender, ability, or sexuality. 'Nor did He permit us and does He permit us to turn religion into morality. 'The old sermons that we have heard so often in England, which I grew up with, which if you boiled them down all they effectively said was: “Wouldn't the world be a nicer place if we were all a bit nicer?” 'That is the kind of moral claptrap that Jesus does not permit us to accept.' Mr Welby was speaking at an event at the Trinity Church on Wall Street, New York City, pictured, which was focusing on inequality in society . He then said that the church has mistaken the way in which they should challenge such inequality saying it began to turn into an 'exclusive little tribe.' The Archbishop then explained that if weren't for Jesus being described as the 'Prince of Peace', Christianity would almost be a call to a 'violent revolution'. He added: 'We are, by contrast, as Christians to be caught up in a revolution of expectation and of implementation. 'Were it not for the fact that He is in title Prince of Peace, and lived out his mission in service and foot-washing, ending it in crucifixion and resurrection, this would be a call to violent revolution.' He also spoke of his experiences of living in Liverpool, where he was Dean of the city's cathedral for four years. He told of how the former Bishop of Liverpool, David Sheppard worked together with his Roman Catholic counterpart Derek Worlock to tackle appalling poverty in the city. The Archbishop's latest comments come after he has been repeatedly outspoken about deprivation in UK cities and how the gap between the rich and the poor is becoming wider since taking up the post in 2012. Just last week, Mr Welby, a former oil trader, spoke out about pay inequality telling all employers they should pay the living wage. He said that most businesses can afford to pay the living wage - which is at least £1.35 an hour more than the minimum wage, saying firms should: 'Just get on with it.' He added: 'It can be done, it should be done.' Meanwhile last year the Archbishop appeared to be on course to clash with Prime Minister David Cameron after calling on him to reverse his decision not to take European funds to boost UK food banks. Talking about his experiences of visiting Congo, where he saw starving children, and then returning to the UK to see a similar situation involving a young family, he said: 'I was talking to some people - a mum, dad and one child - in a food bank. 'I found their plight more shocking. It was less serious, but it was here. And they weren't careless with what they had - they were just up against it. 'It shocked me that being up against it at the wrong time brought them to this stage. There are many like them. But we can do something about it.' In 2013, he also warned against dismissing all people on benefits as scroungers and challenged government claims that people were using food banks simply because they were there. He said it was important that ministers do not use ‘derogatory language’ to describe people who are poor.","The Archbishop of Canterbury spoke out at an event in New York City .

"Bungling thief Jason Farmer was jailed for three-and-a-half years after his electronic tag placed him at the scene of a burglary . A dopey burglar who raided a house while wearing an electronic tag that tracked his every move is back behind bars. Bungling Jason Farmer was arrested within four hours of the break-in after police were able to place him at the scene of the crime by the gadgets satellite signal. When officers  arrested the 23-year-old serial burglar they found his haul, including two stolen laptops and a mobile phone. Farmer was fitted with the 'Buddy Tag' after being released on licence from a previous prison sentence in August last year. He was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Maidstone Crown Court after he admitted carrying out the early morning burglary. The judge was told how Farmer broke into the property in Maidstone, Kent, while the owners were sleeping on December 23, and stole two laptops worth £1,000. They awoke to find a candle had been lit by an intruder who got into their home through a fanlight in the conservatory. Prosecutor Bridget Todd told the court that Farmer's tag showed he had left his home at 2.38am and was in the garden of the raided property at 3.09am. When he was arrested police found the two stolen laptops, one of which contained a 'lifetime' collection of photos, and a mobile phone taken in another burglary six days earlier. The prosecutor said Farmer, of no fixed abode, had a number of previous convictions, including eight for house burglaries and seven taken into consideration. The court was told he was a 'three strikes' burglar which qualified him for a three-year minimum prison sentence. Philip Sinclair, defending, said Farmer's first conviction was at the age of 13. 'He has no explanation as to why he keeps re-offending,' he said. Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, was told that Farmer was arrested within four hours of the break-in after police were able to pin-point him to the scene of the crime . 'He had been on licence for several months and was apparently doing well. 'He made himself available for satellite tracking with a Buddy Tag. 'He knew if he re-offended he would be caught. He went out in the middle of the night and committed the offence. 'He has committed a burglary knowing he would be caught. He is not giving me any clue as to why he keeps re-offending. It may be he is hiding a drug habit but he is not admitting it. 'He said he wanted to buy his mother a Christmas present. There is clearly something going on. He is not doing it because he is wicked.' Recorder Deborah Charles told Farmer his victims were forced to spend Christmas making police statements, rather than enjoying themselves.","Jason Farmer was fitted with the tag after being released from prison .

"President Barack Obama has abandoned a proposal to scale back the tax benefits of college savings plans amid a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats. Obama announced the changes to popular accounts, known as 529s for the area of the tax code that allows them, last week as part of his State of the Union address. It was part of a plan to consolidate and simplify a sometimes confusing array of tax breaks for college students into two simple measures that would result in a net tax reduction of $50 billion over 10 years. Resistance from Congress was swift, with even Democrats deriding the 'middle-class economics' proposal  as anti-middle class. In this Jan. 20, 2015 photo, President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington. The White House is already dropping a proposal Obama made in the speech to to scale back the tax benefits of college savings plans amid a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress . Aides said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi pushed senior administration officials to drop it as she flew with the president aboard Air Force One from India to Saudi Arabia. Other Democrats also privately weighed in against the plan, including Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, and New York Sen. Charles Schumer, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. 'The President's plan has the puzzle pieces necessary to bring the middle class back, but this particular piece didn't fit,' Schumer said in a statement. The White House said Wednesday Obama yanked the proposition from his budget because it had become a 'distraction.' Obama's plan would have levied taxes on future contributions to the 529 college savings plans. Current accounts would have been grandfathered, so existing funds could still grow and be withdrawn, tax-free. Contributions to college savings plans are not tax-deductible at the federal level. But once the money is invested, it can grow and eventually be withdrawn with no tax on the earnings, as long as the money is spent on tuition, fees, books and supplies needed to attend post-secondary school. The savings plans, which are sponsored by states, can also be used to prepay college tuition. About 12 million families take advantage of college savings plans. About half were held by families making more than $150,000, according to a 2012 report by the Government Accountability Office. About 30 percent of plans were held by families who make less than $100,000, the report said. Roughly 10 percent of 529 accounts are maintained by families with incomes of $50,000 or less, the College Savings Foundation told the New York Times. The Obama administration said all the additional revenue it obtained by taxing withdraws from 529s would have been used to help expand and make permanent a $2,500 tax credit that families can use for education expenses. Under current law, the tax credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. The White House said Wednesday Obama's proposal to scale back the tax benefits for savings plans was just component of his overall plan to cut taxes for the middle class and to make college more affordable and tried to downplay the significance of the president's about-face. The part affecting 529s would have only amounted to $1 billion in revenue over 10 years and was 'a small, tiny piece of a program we wanted to implement on behalf of middle class families,' White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters. Obama is also putting forth a 'bold' $60 billion plan to make the first two years of community or technical college free. 'He didn't want this to be a stumbling block that would jeopardize the rest of the package,' Schultz said. Asked if the White House still stood by the 529 roll back as good policy Schultz said: 'Sure. We do.' President Obama and the first lady just returned from a trip to India and Saudi Arabia. They are pictured here at the 66th Republic Day celebrations and the Republic Day Parade on Rajpath in India. As they were on the flight back to the U.S. the White House was scaling back changes to the tax code the president had planned to introduce in his budget next week . House Speaker John Boehner commended the president on Tuesday evening for backing away from the proposal. 'I’m glad President Obama has decided to listen to the American people and withdraw his tax hike on college savings,' he said. Earlier in the day, at a Capitol Hill news conference, Boehner had called on Obama to remove his plan from his budget request, due to Congress next week. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, also celebrated the White House's retreat, as did the top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'This is welcome news for the countless hardworking parents who make sacrifices to save and provide for their children's futures,' Collins said in a statement. For McConnell, the disagreement with Obama over the usefulness of 529 accounts was personal. 'I fought to ensure these plans were tax-free at the federal level,' he said. 'Thanks to this incentive to save, millions of Americans use 529s to help prepare for college expenses. 'These are good plans that promote responsible savings. I’m not sure why President Obama would have sought to undermine them in the first place. It’s just good to see the president coming around to Republicans’ pro-middle class view in the end,' McConnell said in a statement. Obama is no longer asking Congress to make changes to the college saving plans but the request will still appear in his budget next week the White House said on Wednesday. 'The announcement yesterday was made after the book was in the shop to be produced,' Schultz confessed.","Obama announced plans to levy taxes on future contributions to the popular accounts, known as 529s, as part of his State of the Union address .

"Sir Alex Ferguson made more than £2million during his first eight months in boardroom roles at Manchester United, accounts reveal. The former manager's 26-year reign in charge of the football team came to an end in 2013, when he became a director and global ambassador for the club. Club accounts now reveal his reported £100,000-a-day roles allowed him to make £2,165,000 between October 2013 and June last year. Sir Alex Ferguson, pictured at the unveiling of a road named after him, earned more than £2m in eight months . The former manager tried to keep a low profile during his first season away from management, for fear he would overshadow his replacement David Moyes, who was sacked after a season in charge. But the club were keen to use Sir Alex's world-famous status to promote the Manchester United brand around the globe. He has travelled the world in his role, with duties including the unveiling of Park Ji-Sung as another ambassador for the club last October. Park became one of five other ambassadors working alongside Sir Alex, joining former greats Sir Bobby Charlton, Andrew Cole, Denis Law and Bryan Robson. Ferguson topped football's managerial rich list shortly before his retirement, when his estimated £7million-a-year from United while he was manager led his estimated worth to be £34million. The club's accounts show the Scotsman - known for his team's 'Fergie time' goals at the end of matches - is being well rewarded for his continued work at United. Ferguson's role as 'global ambassador' after retiring as Manchester United manager has been lucrative . Ferguson also has other sources of income, making at least £1million from sales of his autobiography and more than £2million selling off part of his wine collection last year. He also has a number of other roles he carries out, having been appointed to a teaching position at Harvard University in the US and heading an elite coaches forum for European footballing body Uefa. The same accounts show Sir Bobby Charlton was also paid by United in 2013-14 for ‘consultancy services’, although he made just £105,000. A spokesman for Manchester United said: 'Sir Alex has been employed as an ambassador for the club, providing support to the club as directed from time to time. As was the case during his time as manager, his contract is a private matter between the club and Sir Alex.'

"Malak al-Khatib, 14, (pictured) from Betin, in the West Bank, has been jailed for throwing stones . A 14-year-old Palestinian girl who was tried before an Israeli military court for throwing rocks at passing cars in the West Bank has been sentenced to two months in prison. The case of Malak al-Khatib, from Betin, in the West Bank, has gripped Palestinians who say her treatment demonstrates Israel's ‘excessive’ measures against stone-throwing youths. Arrested last month, she is one of only a few underage Palestinian girls who have ever been arrested and sentenced by Israeli authorities. Palestinian officials say she is the youngest girl ever detained and sentenced by Israel — a claim Israeli officials and rights groups said they were not able to confirm. On December 31 Malak walked to a West Bank road used by both Israelis and Palestinians and began throwing stones at passing cars, officials told her parents. Israeli security forces arrested her and said they found a knife in her possession. Malak was charged with stone-throwing, attempted stone-throwing and possession of a knife. Under a plea bargain, she was sentenced to two months in prison and a $1,500 fine. Her father Ali al-Khatib, said: 'A 14-year-old girl won't pose any threat to soldiers' lives. 'They are well equipped and well trained so what kind of threat could she have posed to them?' The Israeli military said Malak was charged with stone-throwing, attempted stone-throwing and possession of a knife. Under a plea bargain, she was sentenced to two months in prison and a $1,500 fine. Malak al-Khatib, 14, was tried before an Israeli military court for hurling rocks and has been sentenced to two months in prison. Her mother Khawla Al-Khatib holds a poster of her  daughter at her home in Beitin village . Having spent four weeks in detention since January 31, she has another four left weeks left at a central Israeli prison for women. Out of more than 5,500 Palestinians currently held by Israel, about 150 are underage and the vast majority of them male, according to official figures  provided by Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. Arrested last month, Malak is one of only a few underage Palestinian girls who have ever been arrested and sentenced by Israeli authorities . Malak is among just a handful of underage girls ever held by Israel. Palestinians and rights groups have criticised Israel for its response to rock-throwing. Israel views rock-throwing as a dangerous tactic and at times a life-threatening attack, and claims it can be the first step toward militancy. Palestinians see it as a legitimate way to resist Israel's occupation. Israel was hit by a wave of riots by Palestinians in east Jerusalem last year, following the killing of a 16-year-old Palestinian boy by Jewish extremists in revenge for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teens. Up to 1,000 protesters were arrested, many of them for stone-throwing. Israeli police said many of those arrested were underage. Some of them, schoolbags still strapped to their backs, hurled stones at security forces on their way to and from school. Protests in the West Bank since then have been more subdued but still occur frequently with Palestinian protesters clashing with Israeli troops — incidents that often end in arrests. Stones and small rocks have become a much-used weapon in the West Bank. In the past six years, more than half of all arrests of Palestinian youths have been over stone-throwing. 'These kids grow up with news about clashes, about oppression of Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and they go to express themselves,' Mr al-Khatib said. Mr and Mrs al-Khatib said their daughter's feet were shackled and she was handcuffed when she appeared in court. Since her arrest, the case has received much media attention in the West Bank and spawned countless memes and caricatures, some showing Malak behind bars and holding a teddy bear. Protesters hold banners to show solidarity with prisoners in Israeli jails and highlight Malek's case. They are pictured in Nablus, West Bank, yesterday . One drawing shows a cherubic Malak — whose first name means angel in Arabic — tied to shackles held by an Israeli soldier. On Twitter, supporters are using the hashtag #FreeMalak. At her home, Malak's bedroom shows the interests of a 14-year-old girl steeped in the realities of day-to-day life in the West Bank. Palestinians hold banners during a protest to show solidarity with prisoners and highlight Malak's case . Bracelets and necklaces bearing the colours of the Palestinian flag and a poster of a man from her village killed in clashes with Israeli forces contrast with a picture of Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo. Sarit Michaeli from B'Tselem said that under Israel's military justice system, Malak will not be afforded the same rights and protections as Israeli minors under Israel's legal system. 'An Israeli child will not be held in detention for three weeks, not even a boy, yet alone a girl, because of these protections provided to children by the Israeli youth law,' she said. Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war - territories the Palestinians claim for their hoped-for state. Palestinians living in the West Bank are subject to Israel's military justice system, but Jewish settlers and Israelis fall under a separate legal system. Issa Karake, head of the Palestinian government's Prisoner Affairs Department, said Malak's case is 'just another in a policy meant to break the spirits of young people resisting the Israeli occupation'. 'The Israelis show no tolerance with the Palestinian children,' Karake said. 'The Israelis are crushing a whole generation.'","Malak al-Khatib, 14, was arrested last month for throwing stones .

"It was billed as one of the 'biggest snowstorms in history' for residents of the East Coast. But one group of residents from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, decided to make the most of the snow from the 'Blizzard of 2015' by having a massive snowball fight downtown. Dozens of residents got in touch with their inner child and gathered up the snow to create huge snowballs which they hurled at each other. Scroll down for video . Ready...set...go: Locals dressed up in winter coats and woolly hats lined both sides of the square . Snow fight: Dozens of adults and a couple of kids let each have a fistful of snow as they had a massive fight . The wintry fun was publicized on Facebook and broke out at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, in Market Square where over two feet of snow had fallen. Locals, dressed up in winter coats and woolly hats and lined both sides of the square where they played in the snow  for about 45 minutes. Organizers said that the event was  in honor of the town's settlers, hearkening back to a fictitious event called the 'inaugural Portsmouth Snowball Fight' of 1624.' Dozens of adults and a couple of kids let each have a fistful of snow as they threw gigantic snowballs aimed at hitting each other right in the face. One person was even seen waving a pirate flag, complete with a skull and crossbones, during the snow melee. According to locals, the fun didn't stop after the snowball fight because everyone continued on to nearby bars which were packed with people who fancied a tipple to warm them up.

"Later this year, SpaceX plans to perform the first test flight of its heavy-lift rocket, known as the Falcon Heavy, with a view to one day taking astronauts to the moon or Mars. And exactly how the rocket will take flight and return to Earth has been detailed in a new promotional video. It shows the huge rocket, which will be the most powerful currently in operation, lifting into orbit before its various boosters autonomously land back at the launch pad. Scroll down for video . SpaceX have revealed how their Falcon Heavy rocket will work. A video shows it lifting off (shown) from a launch pad in Florida. Its side boosters and core then land themselves back at the pad. SpaceX say reusability is key to keeping launch costs down. The Falcon Heavy will be used to take astronauts to the moon and Mars . The video shows how the Falcon Heavy rocket will take off with four million pounds (1.8 million kg) of thrust from Launch Complex 39A at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. ‘Thrust at liftoff is equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft operating simultaneously,’ according to SpaceX. The goal of the rocket is to provide a means of lifting large amounts of cargo into space at a relatively low cost. It is estimated that each flight of the rocket will eventually cost about £56 million ($85 million). Height: 224.4ft (68.4 metres) Weight: 3.23 million lbs (1.46 million kg) Total width: 38ft (11.6 metres) Thrust at liftoff: 4 million lbs (1.8 million kg) Engines: 27 Merlin 1D engines . Lifting capability to low Earth orbit: 117,000lbs (53,000kg) Lifting capability to geostationary orbit: 47,000lbs (21,200kg) Lifting capability to Mars: 29,000lbs (13,200kg) Expected first launch: Mid-2015 . For comparison, Nasa's comparable Space Launch System, which admittedly is more powerful, will cost about £330 million ($500 million) per launch. To do this, SpaceX plans to return most of the rocket back to the launchpad, enabling its boosters to be used on multiple flights. The rocket is designed with a central core booster that is derived from the smaller Falcon 9 rocket - which has already completed many successful flights. Strapped to either side are two additional  Falcon 9 rocket cores. Once they have exhausted most of their fuel, the two side boosters are released. The video shows how they will then spin around in Earth’s atmosphere and descend in a controlled manner back to Earth. As they descend, landing legs are deployed - and the two boosters land back at the launch pad from where they took off. There’s a bit of artistic licence in the video, though, as it’s unlikely the boosters would land at the same time - instead touching down probably around 30 seconds apart. Nasa’s Space Launch System (Block II) Lifting capability: 290,000lbs (130,000kg) Falcon Heavy . 117,000lbs (53,000kg) Space Shuttle . 53,790lbs (24,000kg) Delta IV Heavy . 49,740lbs (22,560kg) Ariane 5 . 44,090lbs (20,000kg) Atlas V . 40,810lbs (18,510kg) The video does highlight, though, how SpaceX will attempt to return their rockets to land - rather than a floating barge, as they recently attempted. Later in the video, the central core of the rocket is then also brought back to Earth, landing near to the other two boosters. Again, there’s some artistic licence - CEO Elon Musk has previously stated it will be difficult to land the core back on the ground, and instead it will most likely land on a barge in the ocean. To get humans to the moon or Mars, a huge rocket is needed to lift a large enough space containing the crew, spacecraft and cargo. In the days of Apollo this was the Saturn V - but now SpaceX are working on this new breed of rocket that they say can do comparable missions much more cheaply. It is being developed alongside Nasa’s Space Launch System,  which will be more powerful - but also much more expensive to fly. SpaceX say their Falcon Heavy rocket will be able to carry twice the cargo of the world’s most powerful rocket currently in operation, the Delta IV Heavy. It will be able to take more than 117,000lbs (53,000kg) to orbit - equivalent to a 737 jet loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel. For comparison, the Falcon 9 can take about 28,700lbs (13,000kg) to orbit - which is roughly the same payload that the Falcon Heavy will be capable of taking to Mars. In the video the two boosters land back at the launch pad (shown) after detaching from the main rocket. SpaceX ultimately wants to make almost all of their rockets reusable in order to bring the costs of launching down. It is estimated each launch of the Falcon Heavy will cost about £56 million ($85 million) The Falcon Heavy is being developed alongside Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, illustration shown, which is expected to complete its first unmanned flight in 2019. It will be considerably more powerful than the Falcon Heavy - but is also much more expensive to fly . This image from an environmental study by SpaceX shows where they intend to land the various components of their Falcon Heavy rocket at Launch Pad 39A in Florida. The contingency pads are for the side boosters, while the main landing pad would be for the central core - as seen in the video . Later this year, Elon Musk is set to reveal the details of SpaceX's secretive Mars Colonial Transporter - the vehicle that could take humans to Mars. It's likely that their mission to the red planet will require multiple launches of the Falcon Heavy. While the power of the rocket is impressive in itself, it is the reusability aspect which will prove to be one of its most desirable features. Earlier this month, SpaceX attempted to land part of one of its smaller Falcon 9 rockets on a floating drone ship. While the attempt dramatically failed, with the rocket exploding as it descended too quickly, SpaceX had always said the first attempt would be risky. Through failure, they will be able to further refine the process - and ultimately begin bringing rockets safely back to the ground after launching. And many will be watching in anticipation when the Falcon Heavy makes its first flight towards the middle of this year .

"The federal government employee who accidentally crashed a small drone onto the White House grounds early on Monday was drunk at the time of the incident, officials said. He lost control of the drone, which belonged to a friend, while operating it from an apartment just blocks away from the mansion. The man, an employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, then texted friends that he was worried the drone might have crashed at the White House before going to sleep, according to the New York Times. A federal government employee was drunk when he accidentally crashed a small drone on the White House Lawn (pictured) early Monday. He contacted the Secret Service the next day and said he had not intended for it to go near the White House and that he had been flying it for fun . The Secret Service searched the North Lawn on Monday morning to see if anything else might be on the ground. Agents were investigating the man's text messages and phone records, as well as interviewing people he had been in contact with before the incident, to corroborate his account . The man remains unidentified and his employer, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, did not specify if any disciplinary action would be taken . He contacted the Secret Service the next morning after reports of the crash spread across the media, and told the agency he had been flying the drone for fun. The man remains unidentified and has yet to be charged with a crime. It is illegal to operate a drone in Washington. The  pre-dawn incident triggered a major emergency response and raised fresh questions about security at the mansion. Secret Service agents were investigating the man's text messages and phone records, as well as interviewing people he had been in contact with before the incident, to corroborate his account. Emergency vehicles surrounded the southeast corner of the White House during the pre-dawn incident, which triggered a major emergency response . The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which provides map-based intelligence and geospatial data to support the nation's military forces, confirmed yesterday a government employee had been questioned by the Secret Service in connection with the security breach. In a statement a spokesman said the employee was off-duty and is not involved in work 'related to drones or unmanned aerial vehicles in any capacity at NGA'. It said the agency was taking the incident seriously but did not specify if any disciplinary action would be taken. The drone, a DJI Phantom model, was too small to be detected by the White House's radar system. It it designed to detect flying objects such as planes, missiles and large drones. President Obama responded to the incident on Tuesday, referring to the drone that crashed in his backyard as 'one you buy in Radio Shack', in a CNN interview. 'There are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play…but we don't really have any regulatory structure at all for it. 'I've assigned some of the relevant agencies...to figure out how we're going to put an architecture in place to make sure these things aren't dangerous and that they aren't violating people's privacies. 'These technologies that we're developing have the capacity to empower individuals in ways that we couldn't even imagine 10-15 years ago.' The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours on Monday morning after the crash. President Obama and his wife were not home at the time, but his daughters Sasha and Malia were. A U.S. Secret Service officer on duty saw and heard the two-foot-wide commercial drone fly at a low altitude into the heavily guarded complex and crash on the southeast side at 3.08am, the agency said. Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, confirmed the discovery of the drone on Monday and said it did not appear to pose an ongoing threat to anyone in the building. The White House saw an increased security presence the morning of the incident as emergency vehicles with lights flashing were clustered near the southeast entrance to the mansion. A security perimeter was set up around the White House to restrict access. There has been a string of security breaches at the White House in recent months. In September, an army veteran with a knife hidden in his pants jumped the fence and made it as far into the East Room before he was tackled. The breach led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later, a college student drove up to the White House's security screening point and refused to leave, prompting his arrest. The White House was briefly on lockdown this August after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. The South Lawn of the White House on Monday morning.  Monday's incident was just one of a string of security breaches that have occured at the estate in recent months . The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.","Off-duty employee of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was flying a small drone before he lost control of it .

"Each year, thousands of tourists flock to the Cotswold's village of Bibury to photograph the picturesque cottages on Arlington Row. But many have been left disappointed with their pictures, complaining their carefully-framed shots are being photobombed - by a bright yellow car parked on the road. Now a row has erupted between the disgruntled visitors and the residents of the Gloucestershire village, who have leapt to the defence of the car's owner - 82-year-old Peter Maddox. Scroll down for video .

The 14th-century cottages, the oldest inhabited properties in the UK, are featured on the inside cover of the British passport and have become the nation's most photographed 'ordinary' homes. Retired dentist Mr Maddox, who uses the car to do his grocery shopping in a nearby village, said his lack of garage leaves him with no choice but to park on the street. But visitors have taken to Twitter to express their frustration at the parking spot, saying his Vauxhall Corsa is 'ruining' the view of the nearby homes, which are owned by the National Trust. Photographer Lee McCallum, who runs a local tour company, sparked a debate when he called the car 'Bibury's elephant in the room'. He tweeted a photo of the scene accompanied by a caption that read: 'Bibury's elephant in the room. The picture postcard street photobombed by the ugly little yellow car - every day.' Mr McCallum does not object to the car being parked there and claims it reflects the 'weirdness of the Cotswolds'. Holiday snaps: Photographers have complained Mr Maddox's vehicle is ruining idyllic shots of the picturesque village. One ranted in a Twitter post that it 'gets in the way', adding he had 'cursed the yellow car' But the 40-year-old added: 'Who owns the car? Why is he parking there? Does he know that his car is appearing in so many photos that are appearing all over the world? 'I know the National Trust isn't entirely happy about it, but they can't do anything about it.' Semi-professional photographer Robin Lawrence, of nearby Bourton-on-the-Water, said: 'That flipping yellow car! 'You have an area of outstanding beauty and as a photographer, you are hampered by the car.' Mr Lawrence, 53, added : 'It gets in the way of photographs. I have cursed the yellow car today.' Mike Fletcher, a journalist and photographer from the village, said: 'Arlington Row is the most photographed cluster of English cottages in the world so the owner of the bright yellow car either hasn't registered that it's probably causing a lot of extra work on photoshop to take it out, or simply doesn't care. Time for a selfie: Two South Korean tourists pose for a photo in front of the cottages on Arlington Row - with Mr Maddox's car featuring in the background. The cluster of homes is the most photographed in Britain . Camera ready: Mr Maddox said he uses the car to do his grocery shopping in a nearby village. Above, a group of visitors carefully position themselves to make sure his car is not in their photo . 'I hope it's the former as it makes me laugh each time I see it to think that someone could be that oblivious to how it doesn't fit the surroundings.' Another Twitter user named Mike posted: 'I live in Bibury. Car is always photobombing tourist pics.' Tourist Wendy Harris, 59, claimed the yellow car spoiled the picture she took of the spot during a visit in 2013. The supermarket worker from Gloucester, said: 'I didn't get the perfect picture because the car was there, unfortunately. 'I took photographs from other angles without it, but then you can't get all the cottages in. Legally, he isn't doing anything wrong but aesthetically, he certainly is. Residents said they expect more respect from tourists visiting the village, and said Mr Maddox had the right to park his car, pictured far right, on Arlington Row . One tourist complained that she didn't get the perfect picture because of Mr Maddox's car, pictured right . 'I'd tell the owner ""Get a different coloured car! Anything but yellow!"" Speaking as somebody who did once own a yellow car, I wouldn't have parked it in such a place.' Slovakian architect Beata Cachovanova, 31, travelled to Bibury to see the world-renowned Arlington Row, but was left disappointed. She said: 'It was there and I could not move it. I come across this problem a lot - something spoiling the perfect picture.' Mr Maddox uses the car, pictured, to do his grocery shopping in a nearby village . Mr Maddox, who has lived in a cottage above Arlington Row for the last 12 years, said he has to park his car there as he has no garage. He said: '[Visitors] can come and talk to me. I would just tell them there is no where else for me to put it.' Mr Maddox bought the yellow Corsa a year-and-a-half ago and uses it to do his shopping in the nearby town of Cirencester, Gloucester. He added: 'She's a lovely car. I saw it and went ""Ahh"". I love it here. It's very nice. The tourists don't bother me - I don't hear them.' Residents of Arlington Row described the twitter spat as a 'storm in a teacup' and leapt to Mr Maddox's defence. Francome Robinson has lived in one of the National Trust cottages for the past 23 years. The 71-year-old said: 'Tourists should get a life. They must realise that we live here. These are our homes. Mr Maddox has every right to park there and there isn't anywhere else he can park. 'There are plenty of places people can take photographs from without getting the yellow car in.' Resident Terence French, 62, who works in security, said: 'The residents are annoyed that this has been brought up. It's unbelievable. 'We put up with a lot from tourists here. This is absolutely ridiculous. There are more important things in life.' Locals also claim they expect more respect from the tourists that visit Bibury. Christine Charlton said that tourists open her door if it is unlocked and peer in the cottage windows. She said: 'This is not Disney World. There's nowhere else to park and Peter is quite elderly. I think it is totally ridiculous.' The National Trust said that they had no influence over where Peter parked his car as he is not an Arlington Row tenant. Spokesman Allan King said: 'He is, we believe, parking on the highway which he is entitled to do. Because he is not our tenant or parking on our land, we wouldn't comment on the car. 'We look after the appearance of Arlington Row and try not to have modern intrusions.' The National Trust said that they had no influence over where Mr Maddox parks his car as he is not an Arlington Row tenant .

"Joanna Michael's family, from Cardiff, have lost a Supreme Court appeal to sue two police forces over her murder in 2009 . The family of a young mother who was stabbed to death by her jealous ex-boyfriend after a 999 blunder say they are 'shocked' by a Supreme Court ruling which means they cannot sue police  for negligence. Joanna Michael, 25, from Cardiff, phoned the police twice in fear of her life before being knifed 72 times by her 19-year-old boyfriend Cyron Williams in 2009. Now the Michael family has been told they cannot sue the two police forces involved, despite a police watchdog ruling that the young mother was failed by South Wales and Gwent police. But the Supreme court ruled the family can still attempt to bring a claim under European human rights laws  - a move which officers had tried to block by relying on a precedent from the Yorkshire Ripper case. Speaking after the landmark ruling, Ms Michael's mother Angela said police 'could and should' have done more to protect her 'beautiful' daughter from the 'savage murder'. She said: 'I have lost a wonderful daughter and her children have lost a loving mother and provider. 'I have brought this case to secure damages for the children and also to make police answerable for their failures to deal effectively with a serious domestic case. 'I am shocked that five of the seven court judges found that the police were not negligent. I take some comfort that the appeal may bring this problem to the attention of the nation.' The ruling, which has given both hope and disappointment to domestic violence campaigners, is another step in what has become a long legal battle for the family. They first won the right to try to bring a claim against both forces in 2011, but their case was thrown out by the Court of Appeal last year. Judges had ruled that, under common law, police have immunity from being sued for negligence for their actions during 'the investigation or suppression of crime'. That decision was upheld today in the Supreme Court with a 5-2 majority, when judges rejected the claim that police owe a duty of care in negligence where they are aware or reasonably aware of a threat to the life or physical safety of a person. The family had launched the legal action after 'individual and systemic failures' meant the emergency services arrived too late to save Ms Michael's life, despite her frantically phoning 999 twice in just 15 minutes. Nicholas Bowen QC, appearing for Ms Michael's family, told the Supreme Court the case was 'desperately important', particularly with regard to cases of domestic violence. He told the panel: 'There is a need for a heightened accountability of the police in the light of recent scandals and investigations which have had a very serious detrimental affect on public and political confidence in police services.' During the hearing, Mr Bowen described how Williams had broken into the young mother's home 'in a mad fit of jealous rage' after he discovered she was in a new relationship. There had been a history of domestic abuse, it later emerged. The court heard how Ms Michael had made her first 999 call on a mobile phone to the police at 2.29am on August 5 2009. She told the Gwent Police operator that Williams had come to the house and found her with someone else. He had then bitten her ear hard and taken the other man away in his car, saying he would return later to kill her. The mother-of-two, 25, (left) phoned the police twice before being killed in a frenzied attack by her 19-year-old boyfriend Cyron Williams (right) Mr Bowen said the 'urgency was absolutely plain' and an immediate response could have meant police reaching her in five minutes. But the call went through Gwent - 'the wrong police force' - and not South Wales, as it should have done. The Gwent operator then told Ms Michael to 'stay put' in the house and keep the phone free so South Wales Police could phone her back, said Mr Bowen. According to the appeal court judgment, the operator spoke to South Wales Police  and said Williams had threatened to return to 'hit' Ms Michael but did not refer to 'the threat to kill'. It meant the call, which should have continued to be graded as requiring an immediate response, was instead graded at the next level down. At 2.43am, a further 999 call was received by Gwent Police from Ms Michael. In that phone call, she could be heard screaming before the line went dead. A court heard how 'individual and systemic failures' meant the emergency services arrived too late to saveMs Michael's life . Police officers arrived at Ms Michael's home six minutes later, at 2.51am. She was found to have been stabbed by Williams 72 times. Williams pleaded guilty to murdering his former girlfriend and was jailed in for life in 2010, with a minimum 20-year tariff. Mr Bowen told the court that the 'factual picture' revealed there were 'crucial legal duties owed to Ms Michael's estate by the police'. He argued that officers had failed to arrive in time and possibly save her life because of unacceptable delays. These were caused by individual and systemic errors of the police which justified them having to face damages claims for negligence, he said. Her family has been trying since 2011 to win their right to sue South Wales and Gwent police . Separately, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) previously ruled that Ms Michael was failed by South Wales and Gwent Police. They criticised both police forces for individual and organisational failures. Mr Bowen added that police were claiming immunity from being sued, largely relying on the 1989 case of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire - the 'Yorkshire Ripper' case. All seven justices unanimously dismissed the cross-appeal by the chief constables of South Wales and Gwent Police to block the family's right to claim under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Right to Life. Finally, five members of the Supreme Court panel dismissed the family's case. The two dissenting judgments in favour of allowing the appeal coming from Lady Hale and Lord Kerr. But dissenting judge Lord Kerr said: ' If the police force had not negligently downgraded the urgency of Ms Michael's call, on the facts as they are known at present, it is probable that she would still be alive.' The anti-domestic violence campaign group Refuge, which had intervened in the case, said it was 'deeply disappointed' that the panel majority had decided the police could not be held liable for negligence. It is calling for a public inquiry into the way in which the police and other statutory agencies in the UK respond to victims of domestic violence. But the group said it was 'encouraged' by the unanimous Supreme Court finding that the Michael family was entitled to pursue its Article 2 human rights claim against the police, saying that should give hope to 'hundreds of recently bereaved families of domestic homicide victims'. Chief executive Sandra Horley sd: ;Joanna Michael, the mother of two young children, died a needless death. No court ruling will change that. Just like hundreds of other victims of domestic violence Joanna was failed by the police when she reached out for help.' She added: 'We are delighted that Joanna's family may now, at least, progress one step further down the long path to justice and that their Article 2 claim, seeking a declaration and compensation from the state, may now proceed. 'This judgment has wider, positive, implications for abused women and children. It secures a small increase in police accountability and widens a previously very narrow doorway to justice for hundreds of recently bereaved families of domestic homicide victims.' Liberty's lawyer Rosie Brighouse said: 'Time and time again, police are failing victims of domestic violence - but, thanks to these archaic rules, even the most breath-taking police negligence goes unchallenged.' Sarah Ricca, solicitor for both Refuge and Liberty, said: 'The fight to achieve equal protection from the law for women facing domestic violence will continue, inside and outside the courts. 'This case was an important step in that fight. The highest court in the land has had to address and acknowledge the stark reality of police failings in relation to domestic violence. Though part of the battle in this case was lost, the rest of the case proceeds. That is an important victory in itself.'","Mother-of-two Joanna Michael was stabbed 72 times by boyfriend in 2009 .

"Couple: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich married his third wife Dasha Zhukova up to seven years ago . Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich secretly married his third wife up to seven years ago, it has been revealed. The  Russian billionaire, 48, who is estimated to be worth £6.3billion, met 33-year-old art collector Dasha Zhukova in 2005 - and she has always been referred to as his girlfriend. But now, the Moscow-born  editor-in-chief of art and fashion magazine Garage has confirmed in a magazine interview that they married 'a few years' after meeting, in a secret ceremony. The Wall Street Journal Magazine article by journalist Tony Perrottet made a reference to the couple who ‘met in 2005 and were married a few years later; they have two children’. The simple mention in the middle of the article is understood to have been approved by Miss Zhukova, but she was unwilling to say anything about their marriage, reported the Daily Mirror. Miss Zhukova - who met Mr Abramovich at a New Year's Eve party hosted by her father - grew up in California. Her father is a prominent businessman and oil magnate and her mother was a scientist. Her parents split when she was three and she and her mother moved to the US when she was ten. She went to a privileged Jewish day school in California and graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara before returning to Moscow and later moving to London. She and Mr Abramovich have two children - Aaron Alexander, born in December 2009 and Leah Lou, born in April 2013. Mr Abramovich has five other children from a previous relationship. Together: Mr Abramovich and Miss Zhukova are pictured in Venice in 2009 (left) and at Chelsea in 2013 (right) Miss Zhukova was previously with Marat Safin, the retired former Tennis World Champion Number 1, but the couple split in 2005. Mr Abramovich meanwhile has been married twice previously. His first wife was Olga Yurevna Lysova, whom he divorced three years after marrying in 1988. His second wife was air stewardess Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina - with whom he had five children. She married Mr Abramovich in 1991 but they divorced 16 years later in 2007 - in a settlement said to be in the region of £150million. It is thought Irina was left with a lump sum as well as four homes. London-based Mr Abramovich is now said to own dozens of properties including nine flats in Kensington, which he plans to turn into a 30,000 sq ft house, as well as a mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens - which he reportedly bought for £90million - and a home in Chelsea. Previous spouse: Russian billionaire Mr Abramovich's second wife was air stewardess Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina (left) - with whom the Chelsea FC owner had five children . He also owns two houses in the Caribbean, a ranch in Colorado, a house just outside Moscow, and the £250million New Holland island off St Petersburg. He also owns two planes – a Boeing 767 and 737 – three helicopters, a customised Ferrari, two Maybach limousines, a Porsche Carrera, a Rolls-Royce Corniche and a VW Golf, as well as at least three supersize yachts. Miss Zhukova hit the headlines in January 2014 when she apologised after being accused of racism by posing in a chair that resembled a bound and semi-naked black woman. The photograph that showed her sitting in the chair designed by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard was published 'completely out of context', she said at the time, adding: 'I utterly abhor racism.’","Russian billionaire, 48, met art collector Dasha Zhukova, 33, in 2005 .

"A couple ballooned to a combined weight of 40 stone during the course of their relationship shed 15 stone together – and now weigh less than they did when they first met in their 20s. Phil and Fran Jones, from Glasgow, knew they had to take drastic action when Mr Jones' favourite snack nearly killed him. He had just eaten a Chinese takeaway in July 2012 when he collapsed. He was rushed to accident and emergency and doctors told him a diet of takeaways, chips and pints had left him with fatty liver disease. Fran and Phil, pictured before their weightloss, settled into a routine of takeaways and junk food . And after ... Phil and Fran are now slimmer than when they met 18 years ago . Facing the possibility of a heart attack, Phil was told he would not see his 50th birthday unless he lost weight. But now the couple weigh less then they did when they first got together – and said despite having celebrated 18 years of marriage, it is like they are dating again. Referring to the warning from doctors, Mr Jones admitted: 'It wasn't a complete shock. 'I'd been told by every doctor I needed to lose weight or I'd be very ill. But being given a time scared me.' He added: 'We're closer than ever.' When Mr Jones, 48, collapsed he weighed 23st 13lb, having been 16st when he started dating Mrs Jones in 1993. She weighed 16st and was a size 24, having been a slim size ten when she started dating him. After being warned by doctors he wouldn't see his 50th birthday, Phil dropped from 23st 13lb (left) to 13st 9lb . Fran dropped from 16st and size 24 (left)  to 10st 10lb and a size 10 (right) by transforming her lifestyle . Mrs Jones, now 40, said: 'We had settled down and were happy. 'But with that we got lazy with our food. And it made us put on weight.' She said they loved pints in the pub after work, bacon sandwiches for breakfast and chips and pizza. Mrs Jones said she was too embarrassed to go swimming and even got stuck in the slide at an adventure theme park. She was also called a 'fat cow' by a stranger in the street. So they decided to lose weight – and within two years had slimmed to smaller than their original sizes. When the doctor saw Mr Jones again he swore with surprise. Mrs Jones now weighs 10st 10lb and wears a size ten. Mr Jones weighs 13st 9lb. The couple are slimmer now than when they married 18 years ago (left in 1996, right, today) They lost weight through a combination of cycling, inspired by the Olympics and their hero Chris Hoy, and healthy eating. They have even competed in the 54-mile London to Brighton cycle ride. Mrs Jones said: 'Our lives have totally changed. 'We're happier and more confident. I hadn't been on a bike for years and found it really hard. But I was determined to keep going. 'Losing weight has been a team effort. The support we've given each other has been a team effort. Breakfast: Fried bacon sarnie, toast with butter and jam . Lunch: A cheese and ham sandwich, a packet of crisps, a chocolate bar . Dinner: Fried chicken, chips, pizza . Snacks:Crisps, chocolate . Breakfast:  A bowl of fruit, boiled egg . Lunch: A roll, chicken strips, salad, fruit, a yogurt . Dinner: Lean meat or fish, steamed vegetables, salad, pasta, rice . Snacks: Fruit, vegetable sticks, cereal bars . 'I'm fitter now than I was at 20. Our relationship has improved too. It feels now like how it did when we first got together.' She said they had tried to shed pounds before. 'We were aware of our weight,' she said. 'We felt self-conscious. We tried to lose it by drinking healthy shakes and going to slimming classes for a few weeks. But no diet seemed to work for us. We would quickly give up and go back to our old ways. 'Phil and I were both overweight and knew we needed to lose it. But I loved Phil regardless of how he looked and he told me all the time I was pretty and how much he loved me. So we never talked about our weight.' They lost weight through a combination of cycling, inspired by the Olympics and their hero Chris Hoy, and have even competed in the 54-mile London to Brighton cycle ride . The couple cherished the time they spent with Mr Jones children from a previous relationship. But the extra weight meant they often could not keep up with the children's games. Mrs Jones, a housing officer, said: 'I hated taking them swimming because I looked fat in my swimsuit. 'When I got on the trampoline I worried people were laughing and thinking I'd burst it. 'I even got stuck on a shoot at an adventure park once and was mortified.' Two years ago, Phil started getting indigestion after every meal and occasional stomach pains. One weekend, after a Chinese takeaway, he ended up on the floor, writhing in agony. The couple say losing weight (left, before, right, now) has helped their relationship as well . Mrs Jones said: 'We were upset and realised we had lose weight this time. There was no alternative. It was lose weight, or die.' But before they began, one other factor played a key role in spurring them on. In recent years neither of them had done much exercise. Yet they were both massive football, rugby and athletics fans. So the couple, who celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary last October, joined a slimming class and changed their diet. 'We stopped eating takeaways and snacking and ate smaller portions,' Mrs Jones said. 'We wanted to lose weight every week so we stayed focussed. We planned exactly what we were going to eat each day.' In June 2013, Mr Jones took up cycling while she hit the gym. She said: 'The more weight that came off, the more classes I wanted to try out. 'I'd started out in baggy tees and joggers, but began to wear Lycra. People said they got tired just reading my Facebook statuses because I was always writing about the gym and classes I was attending. 'Our lives have totally changed.'","Couple's weight slowly rose due to routine of take aways and pub nights .

"An abattoir boss who failed to track horse carcasses from pasture to plate could be jailed after he became the first person to admit crimes linked with the fake beef scandal. Peter Boddy, 65, ran a slaughterhouse which sold horse meat to customers in the run-up to the  furore over fake beef which gripped Britain from January 2013. Three months ago he admitted failing to keep adequate records on 50 horses between May 2012 and February 2013. Today he admitted a second charge relating to 17 horses. Guilty: Abattoir boss Peter Boddy, 65 (left) failed to track horse meat in the run-up to the furore over fake beef which gripped Britain in 2013. The firm's manager David Moss (right) admitted falsifying an invoice . Wearing a khaki hunting jacket and a deerstalker, Boddy was warned he could be facing jail - with the maximum possible term set at two years. Boddy ran a slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, with 54-year-old manager David Moss, who also appeared in court today. Moss admitted one charge of falsifying an invoice which related to one of the sales. However, he denied failing to comply with food traceability requirements and another charge of failing to abide by EU meat traceability regulations. Both charges were ordered to lie on file. The court heard the animals could have entered the human food chain after Boddy failed to keep records that traced them from pasture to plate. Scandal: Boddy's slaughterhouse in West Yorkshire, pictured, which was raided by police and officers from the Food Standards Agency. However, there was no suggestion buyers did not know the meat was horse . Although there was no suggestion he had duped his customers, it was unclear where the animals had ended up because meat traceability laws were not followed. Judge Alistair McCreath warned the pair: 'I tell you now, I have reached no view whatever as to the right sentence. 'No preliminary view, no settled view, nothing. I say that so that you understand that by granting you bail and ordering reports I don't give you any indication. 'So don't run away with the idea that I have given you any kind of hint, any kind of indication or promise what is going to happen with you.' Boddy, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, and Moss, from Higher Moss, West Yorkshire, will be sentenced on March 23. Dafydd Raw-Rees, left, and Colin Patterson, right, deny similar charges in a separate prosecution . In a separate prosecution Dafydd Raw-Rees, 66, and Colin Patterson, 44, are charged with a catalogue of food-labelling failures over the food firm they ran in Aberystwyth. Their company, Farmbox Meats Limited, allegedly sold goat meat to unwitting customers as 'lamb trim' and 'lamb shanks'. Raw-Rees and Patterson are also accused of processing horse carcasses, without regard for traceability guidelines. They have yet to enter a plea to that charge, but have denied 19 counts of mislabelling meat products from their company. Raw-Rees and Patterson, both from the village of Bow Street, Dyfed, are on bail and will face trial on May 18 at Southwark Crown Court.","Peter Boddy, 65, failed to keep sufficient records while selling carcasses .

"Italian police have arrested 163 in a major crackdown on  the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia gang- said to be the most powerful crime organisation in the country. The crime syndicate from Calabria, in Italy's deep south, are believed to be the biggest importers cocaine in Europe. Over the last two decades, they have outgrown rival gangs in Sicilian and Naples to be regarded as the most powerful mafia organisation in Italy. Now Italian police have dealt a major blow to the gang as they carried out arrests across the country, with more than forty alleged members and associates detained in Calabria alone. Italian police arrest members of the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia gang- said to be the most powerful crime organisation in the country . Officers also seized an incredible 1,300lb of drugs and found evidence of the trafficking of another 3,300lb of coke and hashish, Reuters reported. The crackdown was coordinated by the national anti-mafia prosecutor and authorities in Bologna, who were expected to give further details of the operation later in the day. Last week police made 31 arrests in connection with an alleged plot  by an offshoot of 'Ndrangheta to take control of Rome's cocaine trade. Secrets revealed: Italian police have deciphered a mysterious document written in a code to reveal that it is an initiation rite into the 'Ndrangheta mafia which is based in Calabria (above) Renowned: The 'Ndrangheta was thrown into the spotlight recently after it was found that the Grillo sisters (above), Nigella Lawson's former personal assistants hailed from a Ndrangheta family . Police were able to move in on the Roman operation thanks to a testimony from one of the four men arrested for Femia's murder, reported The Local Italy. To extend its reach over the city's drug market, the 'Ndrangheta formed a hit squad to shoot dead a rival mob boss two years ago, police added. 'The 'Ndrangheta considers Rome an integral part of its criminal project. Some members have said: 'Rome is the future',' anti-mafia magistrate Michele Prestipino said. 'The Rome marketplace is strategic and helps the clans accumulate criminal and economic power.' The group had logistical bases in Genoa, Milan and Turin, and sent representatives to liaise with the most violent Colombian cocaine cartels, Finance Police Commander Cosimo Di Gesu said. With businesses struggling to survive during six years of on-off recession in Italy, mafia groups have grown in Rome and other parts of Italy not normally associated with organised crime. Officers had seized more than half a ton of cocaine and cannabis, an arsenal of firearms, and a notebook detailing initiations into the mafia group. The arrests led to police releasing previously-unseen secret footage of secret 'Ndrangheta initiation rites. New members swore allegiance and took an 'oath of poison' where they pledge to poison or shoot themselves if they betray their brothers. Italian police have dealt a major blow to the gang as they carried out arrests across the country, with more than forty alleged members and associates detained in Calabria alone . Hieroglyphics: The documents and cipher were seized in a raid in Rome yesterday, when police swooped on 26 members of the 'Ndrangheta and discovered more than half a ton of cocaine and cannabis . Italian police have deciphered a mysterious document written in a secret code to reveal that it is a mafia initiation rite. The encrypted pages were entirely covered in letters resembling Cyrillic, Arabic and ancient Chinese characters. Investigators came across the document during a raid on the home of a murder suspect in Rome. The document described the 'so-called baptism' into the 'Ndrangheta mafia, Italy's richest and most ruthless organised crime clan which is based in Calabria. Elsewhere it outlines the founding myth of Italy's mafia gangs. The 'Ndrangheta believes itself descended from one of three Spanish knights who saved the honour of their sister by killing a man, but were banished for their crime to the Sicilian island of Favignana. There they wrote the first code of conduct and formulated the law of 'omertà' - the code of silence - before splitting up to form secret societies. One went to Sicily where he formed the Cosa Nostra; another went to Naples where he formed the Camorra; the third went to Calabria where he formed the 'Ndrangheta. During the secret ceremony the recruit must use a knife to cut his skin before swearing a solemn oath of 'blood and honour'. Cipher: This invaluable document has allowed Italian police to decrypt the secret code of the 'Ndrangheta . The initiate drinks his blood and swears 'eternal allegiance to the honoured society' promising to respect the rules of the clan, disown mother, father, brothers and sisters and settle all disputes cent for cent.' The document lays down precise rules for the initiation rite 'For the baptism, five people are needed – no more and no less,' it said. The oath must be recited three times as the number is considered powerful in Ndranghta tradition. The ceremony should be carried out in a place that is consecrated by those present before with the process completed in reverse afterwards. The three-page, hand-written document is steeped in quasi-religious superstition. One section reads 'How should you recognise a man of honour? With a gold star on his forehead, a knight's cross on his chest and a gold palm in his hand. 'And how will you recognise these fine objects that you cannot see? Because he wears them in his flesh, skin and bone.' The 21-letter enigma was cracked by two police officers with an interest in codes and puzzle-solving. They were initially flummoxed but a breakthrough came when they recognised the symbol that represented the letter C, which allowed them to gradually replace the other symbols with letters. The document provides the most complete picture of 'Ndrangheta initiations collected so far.","'Ndrangheta has been one of Italy's biggest crime syndicates for 20 years .

"The menopause is a b***h - as these three women will testify. But when it comes to your sex life, there’s still a lot you can do to manage symptoms and come out on top - literally. Post-menopause means there’s no nasty periods to contend with. The kids have all moved out which means you can have sex when and where you want. There’s no pregnancy worries and you’re not afraid to ask for what you want. Scroll down for video . Sexpert Tracey Cox shares her tips on how to enjoy an active sex life post menopause . Sex can be better than it was before, if you follow some simple advice. 1. Have the right attitude . Like everything in life, it’s your attitude toward what’s happening that counts the most. Focus on the negatives - and I’m not about to tell you there aren’t any, there are! - and it can be a miserable experience. Focus on solutions and the pluses and you'll find you get a totally different result. Women who have a healthy libido and are interested in keeping their sex life going, continue to have strong, healthy orgasms well into their 60s and 70s. Perhaps because sex becomes less penetration focused, some women find they become multi-orgasmic post menopause. 2. Use a good moisturiser . Oestrogen levels drop during menopause. The result? You’re more prone to urinary tract infections and sex becomes uncomfortable because the walls of the vagina are thinner, less elastic and dryer. In real terms, this means while you might have enjoyed a passionate session in your 20s and 30s, it’s more likely to have you screaming for all the wrong reasons post 50. Happily, there’s lots you can do to fix this one. Tracey says that sex after menopause has plenty of benefits such as no period to contend with . First up, invest in a vaginal moisturiser (like Replens) and use lots of lubricant during sex (like Liquid Silk or Pjur). If that doesn’t sort things, ask your GP about an oestrogen preparation to use locally (like Vagifem or others available as a cream, pessary or vaginal ring). 3. Consider HRT or natural alternatives . Opinion divides sharply on whether hormone replacement therapy is dangerous but a lot of the previous evidence against it has since been discredited. There are women who absolutely shouldn’t take HRT (see your GP for a full analysis and search online for natural alternatives if you don’t like the idea of taking synthetic hormones) but lots can. And by God, does it make a difference. HRT keeps the genitals in better condition, increases desire and vaginal lubrication - all of which makes sex one hell of a lot more appealing! Reduce any health risks by taking the lowest dose you possibly can for the shortest period of time and try a gel, where you have more control over the dosage and can get it completely right for your personal needs. 4. Get your testosterone levels checked . I wrote about this some time ago and got the fiery response I expected when advocating something unusual. But if your testosterone level is low - which can happen pre-menopause, as well as after because the levels fall with age - the urge for sex decreases substantially. Replace what your body isn’t producing anymore and you could find your sex drive is back to what it was in your 30s. No desire for sex is the most common sexual menopausal symptom. A changing body shape, irritability and hot flushes don’t exactly encourage women to rip their clothes off and race into the bedroom, but low testosterone is often the main culprit of a low or non-existent libido post-menopause. Make an appointment with your GP to get your testosterone levels tested and take it from there. It’s not just your sex life that may benefit from the gel: low testosterone levels have been associated with Altzheimer’s disease and other memory problems, heart disease and lowered bone density. Rub a very small amount into the inside of your thigh or tops of your arms daily and you can get results within two weeks to a month. 5. Have sex that doesn’t revolve around intercourse . As you’re struggling with your ageing dilemmas, he’s struggling with his: a lot of men over 50 have problems getting or maintaining erections. This actually isn’t such a bad thing. If he takes longer to get aroused, it means you’re both likely to spend longer on foreplay, generally upping the arousal level for women. Oral sex, using vibrators, stroking - all become more enjoyable as a result. It’s almost a shame that Viagra means his ED is fixed in most cases! (Though the very good news is the pharmaceutical companies are finally making headway with a pill that’s designed to boost desire in women.) Even if he does have ‘help’, sex is usually slower, more playful and revolves less around intercourse being the main event as we get older. Whoever said (your sex) life begins at 50, was damn right!

"Brock Allen Turner, 19, is accused of raping an unconscious woman near fraternity housing . A teenage former Stanford swim star and U.S. Olympic triallist is to be charged with raping a woman while she lay unconscious in the university grounds. Brock Allen Turner, 19, reportedly tried to flee after two men on bicycles spotted him on top of the alleged victim in the early hours of January 18. The pair managed to tackle him while a third man called the police, Santa Clara County prosecutors say. After his arrest he was released on $150,000 bail. The alleged victim was not enrolled at Stanford and was visiting the campus for a party, according to the district attorney’s office . Turner, an Ohio native, is expected to be formally charged today with five counts relating to the alleged incident, including rape of an unconscious woman, rape of an intoxicated woman and two charges of sexual assault with a foreign object. 'She was lying on the ground unconscious, not moving,' said Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci of the alleged victim. 'She’s recovering,' Kianerci added. The woman was taken to the hospital and treated for her injuries. If convicted Turner, who raced in the London 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, could face up to 10 years in prison. He voluntarily withdrew from the university yesterday, Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin told the LA Times. Turner is also no longer practicing with his swim team. Turner last swam for the university in a January 10 meet against Pacific, finishing third in the 1,000-yard freestyle and second in the 200-yard backstroke. Heavy.com reports that Turner, originally from Ohio, swam for the Dayton Raiders before being recruited for Stanford and was a three-time All-American high school swimmer at Oakwood High School. See more at KRON4 . The alleged attack took place on Stanford University's campus in Santa Clara County . Some accomplishments include breaking the Ohio record for fastest time by a male 18 and under in the 800-meter freestyle, winning high school state titles in the 200 and 500 freestyle, and making the U.S. Junior National team. Stanford isn’t letting Turner’s athletic excellence obfuscate his alleged criminal behavior. 'This is something that the University takes very seriously, and the University took immediate action,' said Lapin to The Stanford Daily. The former first year student is not allowed to re-register for classes and is barred from setting foot on campus, according to Lapin. The alleged attack took place near some student housing and the Kappa Alpha fraternity house, but there is no indication the fraternity is involved in the investigation, she said. Turner is expected to appear in court to enter a plea on Monday. SFGate reports that Stanford is among the Universities criticized for having relaxed policies on sexual assault. A law professor at the university, Michele Landis Dauber, has urged the school to make serious changes in their policies towards sexual assault. Only four of the 175 reported sexual assaults at Stanford between 1997 and 2009 were properly investigated. Dauber has called the statistics 'appalling.' Dauber said that despite some improvement by the school in investigating sexual assault cases and acting for welcoming to victims, there is still room for improvement. The school commended the cyclists who stepped in to save the alleged rape victim. 'Several students, both graduates and undergraduates, were upstanders in this situation,' Catherine Criswell, the University’s Title IX Coordinator, told the Stanford News Report. 'They made the courageous decision to intervene and provide assistance. That is exactly the type of leadership and caring we attempt to cultivate in our community, and we commend those students on their courage and quick response.'","Brock Allen Turner, 19, was apprehended by two men on bicycles .

"Francis O'Neill had 'no comprehension' that he had beaten his wife of 40 years Monica, 73, (pictured) who was found dead in the hallway of their home in Malvern, Worcestershire . A dementia sufferer who had no idea he had battered his wife to death and still asks for her daily has been detained indefinitely. Francis O'Neill had 'no comprehension' that he had beaten his wife of 40 years Monica, 73, who was found dead in the hallway of their home in Malvern, Worcestershire. The grandmother was found with 65 injuries, including broken ribs, a blunt blow to the head and a broken tooth. Worcester Crown Court heart that Mr O'Neill, a grandfather-of-four, appeared confused and bewildered after approaching neighbours for help at 11.45pm on January 20 last year. Police were called to the couple's home, where they found Mrs O'Neill's body in the hallway. A post-mortem recorded her death was caused by extensive injuries to her head and body. Mr O'Neill, who had been married to his wife for more than 40 years, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder but was deemed unfit to stand trial because of his illness. He was subsequently tried under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 and was found to have killed Mrs O'Neill by a special verdict by a jury last November. The former merchant seaman was ordered to be detained in a secure hospital at Worcester Crown Court on Monday. Judge Robert Juckes QC also ruled that further restrictions for public safety under section 41 of the Mental Health Act should be put in place if his release is ever considered. He said Mr O'Neill had never 'appreciated what he had done' and said he still asks about his wife even now. Paying tribute to Mrs O'Neill after the hearing, her family described her as a 'proud grandmother, devoted mother and loving wife', who volunteered at the WRVS shop at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Her three children Sinead O'Neill, Martin O'Neill and Katherine Letchford added: 'If our mum ruled the world it would be spring all year round. 'She was born on a Good Friday and loved to see the daffodils and crocuses coming out, knowing her birthday was just round the corner. '(She was a) proud grandmother, devoted mother, loving wife, good neighbour, trusted confidante, loyal friend.' The court heard Mr O'Neill, known by his second name Brian, had suffered from significant dementia for a number of years and it was getting progressively worse. At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Gareth Walters said the couple's neighbours Brian and Carol Holt were awoken by Mr O'Neill asking them how to contact 999. Mr O'Neill seemed 'quite unaware' of what had happened but had an injury to the knuckle of his right hand, which continued to swell. The grandmother was found with 65 injuries, including broken ribs, a blunt blow to the head and a broken tooth. Worcester Crown Court heart that Mr O'Neill, a grandfather-of-four, appeared confused and bewildered after approaching neighbours for help at 11.45pm on January 20 last year . He claimed he had left her watching TV, saw her asleep and then shook her to try to wake her. Police found him 'confused and bewildered' and after being assessed as having dementia, he was not interviewed by officers. Neighbour Brian Holt told the court: 'Brian seemed completely oblivious to what happened. He was concerned about where his house keys were. 'I still can't believe what has happened. They were a very loving, happy couple.' In her statement, Carol Holt said: 'Mrs O'Neill was a lovely lady and had a good relationship with her husband, who referred to her as ""The Commander"", and she did everything for him.' Forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt added: 'Mrs O'Neill died from multiple injuries, including a blunt injury to her head. 'Some of her injuries may have been accidental or through a fall down stairs but others were consistent with blows from a fist or defensive wounds as she tried to protect herself.' Detective Inspector Andrew Price, from West Mercia Police, said: 'This is a particularly tragic case for all concerned. 'I am satisfied with the decision of the jury and feel the sentence was appropriate given the defendants continuing mental health issues. 'My thoughts are with Monica O'Neill's family at this difficult time.'","Francis O'Neill had 'no comprehension' he'd killed his wife Monica .

"A California store that looked as if it was selling chairs and couches was actually in the business of peddling pot. Police believe the Bay Area furniture store opened by Phuc Nguyen, 39, was really a front for his illegal indoor marijuana growing operation. The front of the Gilroy Furniture & More store, which never even opened for business, was  filled with furniture that wasn't even for sale. Police say Nguyen opened the Gilroy Furniture & More store (pictured) in the Bay Area as a front for his illegal indoor marijuana growing operation . Police found more than 1,000 marijuana plants and more than 50 pounds of processed marijuana in the back room of the alleged furniture store . Phuc Nguyen, 39, was charged with theft of utilities and illegal cultivation of marijuana for sale . However, the store's back room contained more than 1,000 marijuana plants  and more than 50 pounds of processed marijuana. The street value of that amount of cannabis is about $2million. Officers from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office obtained a search warrant and raided the store after a month-long investigation. After finding the marijuana, they also discovered that Nguyen had 'bypassed the electrical meter and had stolen an estimated $80,000 worth of electricity.' Nguyen was arrested in the store and booked on charges of theft of utilities and illegal cultivation of marijuana for sale. Santa Clara County Sheriff's Sgt. Kurtis Stenderup told NBC Bay Area: 'We don't see a lot of storefront operations with a large-scale illegal enterprise going on in the back. 'I think in the movies and on TV they like to think it happens all the time, but in reality, we just don't see that level of sophistication.' Last year, the Santa Clara Sheriff’s Office Marijuana Enforcement Team seized more than 104,000 pot plants and more than 250 pounds of processed marijuana. The team also arrested 20 people and seized three firearms. Nguyen is being held on $200,000 bail.

"They’re a firm favourite on dinner-plates across the country, and a Friday-night cod wouldn’t be the same without them. But the humble chip is a food we take for granted – scoffing 382 million portions every year; fried, oven-cooked, fat ones, crinkly ones, curly ones, French ones. So what does it take to cook the perfect chip? This is something top chefs ponder to make this moreish sidedish retain its crown as one of Britain’s best-loved foods. Scroll down for video . Anucyia Victor (right) learns how to cook the perfect chip with some help from The Fish & Chip Shop's Executive Chef Lee Bull (left) and  head chef Steve Wilson (centre) The perfect chip is made with Agria potatoes which grow in Cambridge . As it's Potato Council's Chip Week next month (16 to 22 February) I’m at The Fish & Chip Shop, Dashwood House, Liverpool Street, to find out exactly how the professionals do it – and how we can create it in our kitchens. Executive chef Lee Bull tells me to start by peeling the potato and cut it lengthways into three slices, at least 1cm thick. The slices are then cut three across, leaving me with a neat pile of nine thick, evenly-cut chips. We’re using Agria potatoes instead of Maris Pipers or King Edwards as chef Lee is convinced it is the best tuber for chips. ‘We’ve tested 27 varieties of potato before we finally settled on this one,’ he said. The Agria, which used to only be grown in Holland, is now grown in Cambridge. ‘While Maris Pipers have long thought to be the perfect chip potato, they can sometimes be inconsistent,’ he said. ‘The Agria however delivers 52 weeks of the year.’ Peel the potatoes (left) lengthways into three slices, at least 1cm thick (right) To remove excess starch, the potatoes are given two cold baths. They are then carefully drained . The chips are fried in 150°c oil for exactly six minutes before they are drained (left). They then have to rest for a minimum of two hours so that the sugars in the potato settle (right) The potatoes are given two cold baths, which removes excess starch from them. Next they are thoroughly drained, with Chef Lee exhorting me to shake the basket to get rid of as much water as possible. The deep-fat fryer is heated to 150°c and the chips get their first fry. Chef Lee watches closely as I dip the chip basket into the fryer and he urges me to give it a little shake so all the chips are cooked evenly. The chips are left to fry for exactly six minutes before I am allowed to take them out of the oil. I get ready to salt them but am surprised when he tells me to step away. ‘We have to leave them to grow cold,’ he says, revealing that the chips are left to rest for a minimum of two hours so that the sugar content settles down, before they are fried again. When it comes to refrying the chips, they are swiftly plunged into 190°c oil. Without a timer I have to keep a close eye on the chip, making sure that they don’t overcook or get burnt. Finally Chef Lee is satisfied with the way my chips look and instructs me to take them out of the fat. ‘Can you hear the sound they make? That’s how you know they’re done,’ he says to me as the golden chips tumble out of their basket and into the bowl. I salt them, shaking the container around as I do that, so their surface is evenly coated. Decanted in their chip cups, Chef Lee gets first taste and nods in approval when he bites into one, slathering it in vinegar while I recklessly dip mine in ketchup. 'Vinegar is the best condiment for a chip,' the chef says as he looks on in disapproval. Crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy within, I'm pleased with my first attempt at making a chip and vow to never eat a frozen fry again. Who needs to when it's this easy to make your own? After a second fry the golden-brown chips are tumbled out into a container and are then salted . Ketchup or vinegar?

"A man dressed as Mr Incredible when he punched and bodyslammed a woman playing Batgirl on Hollywood Boulevard last year has been found guilty of battery. Muhammet Bilik, 35, was sentenced to a day in jail, three years probation, 20 days of roadside cleanup and 36 anger-management classes in Los Angeles, California on Tuesday. The scrap, which was caught on camera and shared to YouTube, unfolded in front of TCL Chinese Theatre on October 22 as stunned tourists walked nearby. Bilik, dressed as Mr Incredible, can be seen holding onto Batgirl as entertainers dressed as Star Wars' Chewbacca, Where's Waldo and mass murderer Freddy Krueger approach. A video captures the moment Freddy Kreuger, Where's Waldo and Chewbacca tried to stop a fight between Mr Incredible and Batgirl on Hollywood Boulevard last year. Mr Incredible has now been convicted of battery . Backup: They managed to separate the duo, who were scrapping over sidewalk territory on the strip . They attempt to break up the fight and Waldo manages to drag Bilik away from the woman. But Bilik apparently finds her in the crowd again and throws her to the ground before tourists then step in to pull him away. The video of the incident, captured by FilmOn, was shared online and went viral. Police did not know the identity of Mr Incredible until Batgirl reappeared on the street a few weeks after the incident, and police interviewed her about the brawl, authorities said. Prosecutors say Bilik attacked the woman following a disagreement over sidewalk territory along Hollywood Boulevard. City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement after Bilik's conviction that the decision was an important one. 'Hollywood Boulevard is famous around the globe and attracts millions of visitors every year. We must keep it safe,' he said. 'The characters who interact with children and family along Hollywood Boulevard have to obey the law.'

Bilik has also been ordered to keep away from the Hollywood Entertainment District throughout his probation. Mr Incredible is the father of a family of superheroes in the hit 2004 Disney-Pixar film 'The Incredibles.' It is just the latest arrest on the strip, according to the Los Angeles Times. Among them, SpongeBob SquarePants was questioned by officers after an altercation with two women in 2011 and two Captain Americas and a Spider-Man got into a brawl in 2013. The behavior became so bad a few years ago that officials held a 'superhero summit' to lay down the law, the LA Times reported.","Muhammet Bilik, 35, was dressed as Mr Incredible when he started fighting with Batgirl in October over sidewalk territory along the famous strip .

"Traditional stories passed down through generations by Australian Aborigines may be among the oldest accurate oral histories in the world, scientists have claimed. The findings have allowed them to map how the continent may have looked around 10,000 years ago. Oral folklore tells how the Great Barrier Reef once formed part of the coastline of north east Queensland, while Port Phillip Bay in Victoria was once a rich place for hunting kangaroo and opossum. Researchers have found other stories from all over the continent that mirror how the landscape dramatically changed towards the end of the last ice age. The Great Barrier Reef, off the Queensland coast, was once part of the mainland according to Aboriginal tales . They say at this time sea levels rose as a result of the melting of the huge ice caps that covered much of the northern hemisphere around 10,500 years ago. The researchers now believe that these stories could constitute some of the oldest accurate oral histories in the world, passing through some 300 generations. Several stories tell how the Great Barrier Reef was once the original coastline of north east Queensland. Stories told by the Googanji people describe how a river entered the sea near to what is now called Fitzroy Island. The Yidindji people who lived in the Cairn's area of Queensland also tell how Fiztroy Island was once called 'gabar', or lower arm. They told how it had once been part of a promontory sticking out from the mainland while nearby Green Island was four times larger and the Island is now all that is left sticking out the ocean. They also describe a place called 'mudaga', or pencil cedar, between Fitzroy Island and King Beach after the trees that once grew there. The finding is remarkable as many anthropologists believe that exaggeration and Chinese whispers often distort oral history so severely that they can no longer be reliable if they are older than 1,000 years old. However, Dr Nick Reid, a linguist at the University of New England, has found that the stories of Australian Aborigines are astoundingly accurate. Hidden within myths of seagull gods and ancestral heroes causing seas to rise and great floods are details of how the landscapes looked before the time. Dr Reid studied 18 traditional Aboriginal stories and found that they seemed to coincide with true geological events. Writing for the Conversation, he said: 'How do we know that these stories are authentic? We suggest that because they all say essentially the same thing, it is more likely that they are based on observation. 'All tell of the ocean rising over areas that had previously been dry. None tell stories running the other way – of seas falling to expose land. 'The huge distances separating the places from which the stories were collected – as well as their unique, local contexts – makes it unlikely that they derived from a common source that was invented.' This graphic shows how Aboriginal stories from all over Australia describe the sea level rise that occurred at the end of the last ice age around 10,000 years ago, causing much of the coastline to be flooded by water . Aborigines on the Tiwi Islands in northern Australia, like those above, tell stories of how an old woman led flood waters to cut off the area from the mainland and these could have survived for 7,500 to 8,900 years . Among the stories examined by Dr Reid and his colleague Professor Patrick Nunn, a geographer at the University of the Sunshine Coast, were a tale told by the Ngarrindjeri people. Australian Aboriginals are famed for their ancient rock art (pictured), but their oral histories are shedding light on their land's past too . It tells how an ancestral hero called Ngurunderi chased his wives on foot to Kangaroo Island, where he angrily rose the seas, turning the women into rocks that now jut out of the water between the island and the mainland. If this is based on true geographical changes, it would mean it originated at a time when seas were around 100 feet lower than they are today, making it around 9,800 to 10,650 years old. Another story describes how the Wellesley Islands in the southern Gulf of Carpentaira was once part of a peninsular that jutted out from the mainland. The story tells how a 'seagull woman' called Garnguur swept down and dragged her raft across the neck of the peninsula to allow the sea pour in. Other stories written down in early colonial times also tell of kangaroo and emu hunting grounds that were later flooded by the rising sea water. The Narrangga people of the York Peninsula of southern Australia told stories that recalled a time when the Spencer Gulf was actually a marshy part of the mainland that was dotted with freshwater lagoons that attracted rich wildlife. Dr Reid estimates that these stories could date from between 9,550 to 12,450 years ago. Similarly other stories tell how the area of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria was also a marshy part of the mainland, making them around 7,800 to 9,350 years old. Aboriginal stories confirm that view from Kangaroo Island, above, off the coast of South Australia would have looked very different around 10,000 years ago before sea levels rose and cut it off from the mainland . A tale told by the Tiwi people describe how an old woman followed by a flood of water crawled between the islands of Brathurst and Melville, now off the coast of Australia's Northern Territory. This, the researchers say, could be telling how the islands were settled and then cut off from the mainland around 8,200 to 9,650 years ago. A traditional story from Western Australia tells how Rottnest, Carnac and Garden Islands, once formed part of the mainland and the land was covered in trees. The story says that a fire took hold and burned with such intensity that the ground split, allowing the sea to rush in. Dr Reid and his colleagues estimate this would have occurred at least 7,500 to 8,900 years ago. Dr Reid said that their findings suggest that other traditional oral histories passed down in indigenous languages around the world could also provide similar nuggets of truth. Local folklore in Australia tells how some areas that were rich with kangaroo like this were lost to the ocea . He said: 'The extraordinary care with which Aboriginal people have passed down these stories over previously unimaginable time depths forces a rethink of the ways in which such oral traditions have previously been dismissed. 'While these examples should not be regarded as a licence for the incautious interpretation the antiquity of oral traditions, or indeed for the belief all such stories have empirical foundations, it does allow for some traditions in some cultures to have survived for far longer than it was once thought any such traditions could.' Another ancient oral history among the Klamath of Oregon is thought to be around 7,700 years old. Professor Nunn added that there could also be stories traditional cultures in India that could be equally as old.","Traditional stories describe how the Great Barrier Reef once formed part of the Queensland coastline and was studded with rivers and promontories .
Other tales tell how modern day bays were once dry land rich in kangaroo .
Scientists say they coincide with sea level rise at the end of the last ice age .

"Sheldon Silver, the longtime leader of the New York state Assembly, will relinquish the position he has held for 21 years in the wake of federal corruption charges, a top lawmaker announced late on Tuesday. The decision announced by Majority Leader Joseph Morelle came after Democratic lawmakers met behind closed doors for two days to discuss their response to the turmoil that has threatened one of the longest careers in American state politics. 'He said to me he will not impede the transition,' said Morelle, surrounded by most of the other 105 Assembly Democrats. 'We'll have a vacancy on Monday.' Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was taken into custody last Thursday on federal charges that he took nearly $4 million in payoffs and kickbacks, but he insists he is innocent . As majority leader, the No. 2 post in the chamber, Morelle would be the acting speaker from the moment Silver resigns until the lawmakers formally convene again Monday. At that point, they plan to amend their rules to keep him as interim speaker until February 10. That's intended to give any other member a chance to express interest and explain how he or she would lead, and make the selection a more open process than it has been in the past, Assemblyman Thomas Abinanti said. 'I think what carried the day is we want to enter the budget process united,' he added, with a new speaker who has the clear, legitimate backing of the Assembly's two-thirds Democratic majority when he or she goes to negotiate with the governor. 'I will not hinder this process,' Silver told reporters later. He declined to respond when asked if he would resign. It is unclear whether Silver would do that or whether his tenure will be formally ended on Monday by legislative action. He has said he expects to be exonerated in the criminal case and has no plans to resign his seat in the Assembly. The 70-year-old Manhattan Democrat was taken into custody last Thursday on federal charges he took nearly $4 million in payoffs and kickbacks, but he insists he is innocent. He has led the Assembly for 21 years — the second-longest tenure of any sitting speaker in the nation. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has called Silver 'a man of integrity' and said on Tuesday that he shouldn't resign . Members of the Assembly said Silver's criminal charges had become a distraction and a problem for entire chamber. 'There is a strong sense among members it would be best for the speaker to step down and for this body to elect a new speaker,' Assembly member Patricia Fahy, D-Albany, said early on Tuesday. 'There is a lot of hard work ahead to move ahead and unite the body behind a new speaker who can best represent the entire state, champion reforms and restore confidence in the Assembly.' She noted, though, that the chamber and Silver have been instrumental in raising New York's minimum wage, legalizing same-sex marriage, funding prekindergarten and other progressive measures. Silver had one vocal ally remaining. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, has called Silver 'a man of integrity' and said on Tuesday that he shouldn't resign. As majority leader, the No. 2 post in the chamber, Joseph Morelle will be acting speaker from the moment Silver resigns until the lawmakers formally convene again on Monday when he is expected to be announced as interim speaker until a vote next month . He added that people have to respect the Assembly's decision, but 'it's crucially important' that there is leadership that's fair to the city, which often doesn't get its fair share from the state government. Some legislators also want rules changed to lessen the central power of the speaker's office and seniority system, establish more transparency in how the chamber operates and make decisions and give the chairmen of Assembly committees more authority. Silver faces five counts, including conspiracy and bribery, and is accused of using his position to obtain millions of dollars in kickbacks masked as legitimate income from two law firms. There was no clear immediate consensus on Silver's permanent replacement. Morelle, Assemblyman Keith Wright of Harlem and Assemblyman Carl Heastie of the Bronx have all been mentioned as likely candidates. Wright said on Tuesday he will seek the position. 'This is the process: You do what you can do to line up support,' Wright said. Silver faces five counts, including conspiracy and bribery, and is accused of using his position to obtain millions of dollars in kickbacks masked as legitimate income from two law firms .","Silver has agreed to relinquish his position as longtime leader of the New York state Assembly .

"Ukip is planning to overturn the ban on smoking in pubs and introduce a 35p tax rate as part of its 100 election promises in advance of May's poll. The party will release a new promise each day until the the date of the general election on May 7. As well as reintroducing smoking in pubs, Ukip claims it would overturn any legislation introducing plain packaging on tobacco. Scroll down for video . Ukip said it would reintroduce smoking in pubs and allow for the introduction of ventilated smoking rooms . Ukip also committed to overturning any rules introducing plain packaging on tobacco products . According to a document released by the party, its top priority is to get Britain out of the European Union. This will be followed by the introduction of an Australian-style, points-based immigration system. The party said they would increase spending on the NHS by £3 billion and scrap tuition fees for 'science, tech, engineering, maths or medical degrees'. They would fund this, they claim, by slashing £9 billion from Britain's foreign aid budget as well as withdrawing from the EU. Ukip's head of policy and deputy chairman Suzanne Evans said: 'UKIP believes we should leave the European Union and spend £3 billion of the £10 billion we pay out every year in membership fees on the NHS instead.' The party said they had several initiatives helping people who had served in the armed forces, including the creation of a veterans' administration and guaranteeing all troops with 12 years' service a job with either the police, prison service or border force. At the same time, Ukip said they would 'cut bureaucracy, red tape and wasteful spending'. In the criminal justice area, Ukip said it would abandon the European Court of Human Rights, scrap the Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant system, and instead introduce a British Bill of Rights. Ukip said that all official documents will be published primarily in English, while they will crack down on honour killings, female genital mutilation and forced marriages. Other pledges contained in the Ukip policy document include the introduction of 'a 35p income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000 – taking many public sector workers out of top rate of tax.' The party claimed they would priortise former service personnel for council housing, while social housing would be prioritised for those whose parents and grandparents were born locally. Ukip said they would be 'reinstating British territorial waters', while child benefit would only be paid for youngsters permanently resident in the UK. They said in future they would restrict child benefit to the first two children. Unemployed people would be expected to participate in workfare or community schemes. Also, Ukip said they would 'safeguard the visitation rights of grandparents'.","Ukip has announced a policy idea for each remaining day of the campaign .

"An American news channel has aired the hilarious moment their presenting team tasted Australian staple Vegemite for the first time. Female anchor Deanna Falzone was so repulsed by the spread’s flavour she gagged on live breakfast TV, declaring: ‘I can’t even swallow that… it tastes like throw up.’ Scroll down for video . Female anchor Deanna Falzone was not impressed when she tasted Vegemite toast for the first time . Fox17 Morning News in Michigan, US, decided to do a taste test of the spread on Australia Day . Weatherman Jon Sharner suggested the Fox17 Morning News team in Michigan tried Vegemite on Australia Day after he experienced it's unique taste while hosting an Aussie exchange student at his house last year. ‘Vegemite is a somewhat national condiment… people compare it to peanut butter in the US, it doesn’t taste anything like peanut butter,’ Jon said while trying to explain the spread. Offering the team up a paper plate with a slice of Vegemite toast each, Jon added: ‘This is toast with butter to help mellow it out a little bit and Vegemite.’ Falzone was so repulsed by the spread’s flavour she gagged on live breakfast TV . Covering her mouth, Falzone declared: 'I can’t even swallow that' Biting into it, one presenter named Rob said: ‘It has a little bitterness, for a second there it tasted like fish.’ Grimacing Deanna noted: ‘That’s bad Jon… I can’t even swallow it.’ ‘Oh my God no I’m not gunna spit it out… I can’t eat it..

"Eighteen-year-old Nolan Burch died two days after being found without a pulse in a West Virginia University fraternity house . A West Virginia student was six times above the legal alcohol limit when he was found without a pulse in a fraternity house. Nolan Burch, 18, had a blood-alcohol level of .493 following a night of events with WVU's Kappa Sigma chapter, police in Morgantown revealed. The legal limit is .08, though it is .02 for those under 21. The freshman from Buffalo, New York, died on November 14, two days after being taken back to the fraternity house after a night of heavy drinking. Police say that Burch, who was just two months into his university career and planning to major in pre-sports management, and 19 other young men were blindfolded and taken to another house to drink large amounts of alcohol. Kappa Sigma had lost its charter from university shortly before but continued with the 'Big-Little' event anyway, according to WVU's student newspaper the Daily Athenaeum. Burch was looking for membership in the fraternity and had tweeted 'It's about to be a very eventful night to say the least' the night of his death. Officers arrived at the frat house around 11.52pm to find that Burch, who was laid on a table after returning to the Kappa Sigma building severely drunk, had no pulse and had turned blue. A policeman attempted CPR, but could not revive the teenager. He died in the hospital from what WVU called a 'catastrophic medical emergency' following two days on life support. A medical examiner's report is still pending in the death, after which criminal charges may be filed. While the amount Burch drank has not been revealed, a blood-alcohol content calculator estimates that a 160-pound male would achieve a BAC of .5 after drinking 23 shots of 80-proof liquor over a period of four hours. Burch had been drinking at a pledging event for Kappa Sigma's chapter at West Virginia University in Morgantown . West Virginia University put a moratorium on all fraternity and sorority activity the day after Burch died, which has since been partially lifted. The university and its Greek life councils released a joint statement on Tuesday saying that the ban on all events with alcohol remains in place. University president Elwood Gordon Gee said that the ban could be finished in a month after reforms that may include, according to the West Virginia Gazette.","Nolan Burch, 18, had .493 blood-alcohol level, adult legal limit is .08 .

"A BDSM-themed advertisement for Domino's Pizza is making the rounds online. The image shows a human tongue tied in spiked chains and sporting a ball gag. The tongue has visible wounds and cut marks - and a hat and whip are seen lying on the ground. The advertisement - apparently set in a dungeon - is meant to promote Domino's Sriracha pizza. New look: The spec Domino's Pizza advertisement for its Sriracha pizza says 'You're going to suffer and enjoy every moment' The slogan 'You're going to suffer and enjoy every moment' is even wrapped in a chain with spikes around the Domino's Pizza logo. However, the company said no to the advertisement's design. 'We’re as shocked as everyone,' Tim McIntyre, a spokesman for the pizza company, told Daily Mail Online in an email exchange. 'The ad was created and pitched by an ad agency to its client, the independent franchise company in Israel.' He continued, 'The ad was rejected because it was ill-advised, unfunny and not brand-appropriate. In a word, it was stupid.' 'Somehow, it got leaked,' McIntyre added. 'When I first saw it myself, I thought it was a parody, just in time for the premiere of ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" I'm still shaking my head.' McIntyre confirmed to Daily Mail Online that ad agency McCann Erickson Tel Aviv pitched the design. Domino's Pizza has said in multiple exchanges with Twitter users that  'This was created with unauthorized use of our branding. The people responsible are being dealt with.' 'It never officially appeared anywhere,' the company Twitter account told Cosmopolitan of the advertisement. E.L.

She said: 'I was just having a night in with my housemates so we decided to order Dominos and watch some films. 'When I was eating my third slice, I bit down on something crunchy. 'I pulled it out my mouth and was shocked to see it was a quite big human fingernail . 'It looked like it had been bitten or torn off and baked in the crust. It was pretty disgusting really.' She added: 'I called them up and took a bit of time to speak to a manager. 'They all seemed a bit shocked and offered to remake a pizza, and said I could have two more free pizzas when I wanted.' When the delivery driver arrived half an hour later, she handed over the fingernail in a sandwich bag to return to the store. She said: 'Also I just want to stress that it was a real yellowy, browny nail, not a fake one.'

"A mother has revealed how she almost lost her unborn baby after she was stabbed in the stomach while pregnant by her ex-boyfriend. Lauren Oliver, 26, from Belton, North Lincolnshire, was attacked on her doorstep by cage fighter Nicholas Leaning, 28, because he didn't want her to have his baby. Speaking on today's This Morning of the terrifying moment he launched his frenzied attack, she said: 'I felt a punch in the side of my head and then a blow to my stomach. I didn't realise I had been stabbed. Scroll down for video . Lucky to be alive: Lauren was stabbed when pregnant with her daughter, Harper . Lauren appeared on today's This Morning to talk about her ordeal . 'He kicked me onto my back and stabbed me another four times. I was asking him to stop and pleading ""don't kill us"". He looked me in the eye and stabbed me again.' The violent events unfolded after Lauren had ended her two-year relationship with Leaning after she discovered he was seeing another woman. After their split, she found out she was pregnant with his child. Leaning demanded she have an abortion but Lauren refused. Lauren told presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakey that Leaning, who already had a child from a previous relationship, was angry that she has decided to keep their baby after they had split up. Lauren said her ex Nicholas Leaning (right) turned violent because he didn't want her to have his baby . 'He wasn't happy, he didn't want another baby, he wanted me to get rid of it,' she said. 'He was angry that I wasn't doing what he wanted.' She hadn't seen him for weeks when he turned up on her doorstep when she was 33 weeks pregnant wearing a mask he used while training as a cage fighter and armed with a knife. After he brutally attacked her, he ran away leaving Lauren screaming for help. She managed to drag herself up and stumble down the street where she spotted a friend who ran to her aid and called an ambulance. The mother-of-two tells presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley how Leaning kept stabbing her even though she begged him to stop . Baby Harper survived the stabbing thanks to being in the breech position in the womb . Once at hospital, her daughter, Harper, had to be delivered prematurely by an emergency c-section. She weighed just 4lbs 1oz and had only survived the stabbing thanks to being in a breech position in the womb at the time of the attack. Lauren, who is already a mother to six-year-old Ruby, said the baby girl is 'her little miracle'. She said: 'I remember lying there, I couldn't believe it had happened. It didn't seem real. I just wanted to know baby would be alright.' Leaning is currently serving a 19-year jail sentence . Harper is now a happy and healthy baby who melted hearts when she joined her mother on the ITV show today. Lauren admitted she doesn't know how she'll be able to tell her the truth about her father. 'I don't know how I will tell her, she probably will hear it before I tell her. I just don't know how to tell a child that her dad tried to kill her,' she said. Leaning was arrested and put on trial at Hull Crown Court last November where a jury took less than two hours to find him guilty of attempted child destruction and wounding with intent. Jailing him for 19 years, Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, said. 'This is an exceptionally serious case of its kind. It calls for an exceptional sentence to reflect the malignancy of your violent behaviour where you brutally stabbed a pregnant woman five times in order to kill her unborn child. 'I repeat - you intended to kill that child and it is only good fortune that prevented the execution of that truly wicked objective.' Lauren said the sentencing has given her some comfort. 'At least I know now when he's out, my daughters will be adults not vulnerable children,' she said.","Lauren Oliver was stabbed by her ex Nicholas Leaning when pregnant .

"A city council has today denied responsibility for the death of twin babies when their mother collapsed at a block of flats and paramedics were unable to get inside to treat her. Jocelyn Bennett, 27, called an ambulance after waking up with severe stomach pains when she was 32 weeks pregnant after suffering a placental abruption. Paramedics arrived 12 minutes later, but she was unable to press a door buzzer to let them in while neighbours refused to buzz in the crew as they thought the blue flashing lights were from police vans about to raid the block of flats. Today the council responsible for the block said the entry system was working but admitted it would review access for emergency services and is considering issuing workers with keys to avoid a similar tragedy. A new picture of Jocelyn Bennett, with her father Joe at her parents home in Birmingham. Today, Birmingham City Council has denied responsibility for the death of her twin babies after paramedics were unable to get into her flat to treat her . During the incident in October, medics were only able to gain access to her home in Pleck House, Druids Heath in Birmingham with the help of police an hour and a half later. Miss Bennett was eventually rushed to hospital where she gave birth to 4lb 1oz Melody and 3lb Rose by emergency caesarean. Tragically, while Miss Bennett slipped into a coma, her baby daughters suffered organ failure and their life support was switched off and they passed away. When Miss Bennett woke from her coma, she was then told the babies had died. Now following an independent investigation, Birmingham City Council today said there was 'no evidence' that they could have prevented the deaths of the children following the incident. Miss Bennett's babies, in a picture released with the permission of the family, who both tragically suffered organ failure and died after being born by emergency caesarean, when their mother fell ill. Miss Bennett's father Joe holding one of the babies in a picture released with permission of the family. While in hospital the family held a 'Christmas party' for the babies before they died . They also insisted that they are looking into improving access to communal doors at council-run tower blocks for the emergency services. Council spokeswoman Janet Priestley said: 'The door entry system to Pleck House had no reported faults on the day of the incident and the city council procedures for access for the emergency services to blocks of flats were followed on the day that Ms Bennett called them. 'The investigation has found no evidence that the city council could reasonably have done anything more that would have changed the outcome of this tragic incident. Health and emergency services are separately undertaking a review. 'This incident has led us to review procedures and we are exploring an improvement to access arrangements so that all emergency services will have keys which deactivate the communal door entry system and thereby giving immediate access. 'This was a very unusual situation. West Midlands Ambulance Service has confirmed that they are called to blocks of flats numerous times per week. 'They are usually able to gain access to communal areas of buildings without difficulty.' Pleck House in Druids Heath, Birmingham, where Miss Bennett lived in a flat and fell ill suffering a placental abruption . Paramedics were unable to enter the tower block through the communal door, pictured, as Miss Bennett was unable to buzz them in when she collapsed in agony . Miss Bennett is still receiving medical treatement and is currently in the process of being rehoused. In response to the council's findings, her father Joe Bennett, 54, who works with adults with mental health problems said: 'They told us that this was the first time emergency services couldn’t get into a tower block, which I do find hard to believe. 'We have been told that if they had reached Jocelyn in time that the outcome wouldn't have been any different, and she would have lost the twins. 'But she may not have fallen into a coma, and she could have seen the twins alive and Jocelyn would have seen the twins had they got in quicker. 'The council accept it has taken them years to realise that the ambulance rely on the public to let them get in these sort of places. 'But they have been honest with their investigation, and something good has come out of this tragedy.' Prior to the deaths of the babies, the Bennett family held a 'Christmas' party for the twin girls and had them christened. Miss Bennett, who was well enough to attend the funeral of her twin daughters in December at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham . The twins' tiny coffins were carried into the crematorium in a white horse-drawn carriage, with white teddy bears and matching floral tributes placed inside . Mr Bennett, his wife Lorraine, and the girls' father Kevin Clarke held a small party in hospital for the twins. Mr Bennett said they documented the party, in which they dressed up in Christmas hats and jumpers, so that they could show Ms Bennett photographs when she awoke from her coma. Weeks later, Miss Bennett was well enough to attend the twins' funeral at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham. Wearing her favourite colour red, she was pushed in a wheelchair behind the twins' tiny coffins as they were carried to the crematorium in a white horse-drawn princess carriage. White teddy bears were placed inside the carriage along with matching floral tributes.","Jocelyn Bennett dialled 999 after stomach pains at 32 weeks pregnant .

"Theresa May said the scheme, which is being tested in Surrey and Sussex and will handle non-emergency calls, will free up frontline officers . Victims should report crime online to help cut the number of 999 calls, the Home Secretary declared yesterday. Theresa May said using the internet would save police money and free up officers for frontline work. Already being tested at two forces, the scheme would cover non-emergency cases such as criminal damage and minor theft. Campaigners warned however that online reporting would further reduce face-to-face contact between police and public at a time when many local stations have closed. There are also fears it might give officers an excuse not to visit crime scenes or even ignore offences entirely. The Home Office stressed that victims of serious crimes, including rape, burglary and assault, should still dial 999. Mrs May said: ‘The growth in the internet has transformed other services – from shopping to banking – and it is right to give victims and witnesses greater choice over how they report issues to the police.’ She said the measure could cut police costs by £3.7million and free up an estimated 180,000 officer hours a year – potentially putting more bobbies on the beat. The Home Office, which is working on a prototype with the Surrey and Sussex police forces, says the scheme will go nationwide within months. Some forces already allow victims to report offences via the web but this initiative would create a one-size-fits-all system for England and Wales. Mrs May insisted victims of crimes such as burglaries and rapes should still call 999, but one force which has developed its own online service includes stalking, domestic abuse and sex offences in its system . Ministers have not yet drawn up a definitive list of offences suitable for reporting online. But one force has included stalking, domestic abuse and some sex offences – all of which attract prison sentences. The online crime reports would be studied by police staff who would decide how to respond. Before the 101 police number was launched – also to reduce 999 calls – research revealed that 80 per cent of emergency calls did not need an urgent response. But in just 12 months more than a million 101 callers failed to get through and many were left hanging on for more than an hour. David Green, director of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘The problem with dealing with a screen rather than talking to a person is that it depersonalises the experience. ‘It feels like you are a crime statistic instead of asking the police to act in defence of the public. ‘At a time when confidence in the police is falling, it would be better if the police were advised to maximise their contact with the public and not to go in search of devices which mean they have as little contact as possible, even if it does save money.’ But Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said: ‘New measures to encourage people to report crimes are very welcome. ‘Sometimes people will feel more comfortable contacting police in this way, especially if they can do so anonymously.’ But campaigners fear the move could give police an excuse to not attend crime scenes themselves, or to ignore call-outs entirely (file image) And Mark Castle, of the charity Victim Support, said: ‘Giving victims more choice and control over their journey through the criminal justice system is something we would of course welcome.’ Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Smartphones, tablets and internet devices are opening up new opportunities for the way people contact the police and forces need to be ready.’ In the past three years, an estimated 264 police station counters have closed – one in five of the national total.","Online reporting for non-emergency calls is trialled in Surrey and Sussex .

"An elderly couple accused of illegally possessing 271 artworks by Pablo Picasso worth up to £80 million are to appear in court in France. Pierre Le Guennec, 75, and wife Danielle, 72, from Mouans Sartoux, near Cannes, claim the artist's last wife Jacqueline gave them the treasure trove of works while Mr Le Guennec was working at Picasso's house as an electrician in the 1970s. They claim on one occasion, Mrs Picasso handed them a box crammed with paintings and sketches and said, 'Here, this is for you'. Scroll down for video . Pierre Le Guennec (pictured right) and wife Danielle (left) claim the artist's wife Jacqueline gave them the treasure trove of works while Mr Le Guennec was working at Picasso's house as an electrician in the 1970s . The couple then kept the hugely valuable horde of art stashed in their garage in southern France for 40 years. They were arrested after they took a suitcase crammed with canvases to the painter's heirs in Paris in 2010 to have them authenticated. Within days of art experts proving the works were genuine, police swooped on the elderly pair at their home  and arrested them on suspicion of receiving stolen goods. They were released without charge while an investigation was launched to establish how the couple had come by the paintings, but eight months later they were formally charged. This painting of a hand by Picasso was among the 271 undocumented, never-before-seen works . The artworks are estimated to be worth around £80 million. They spent 40 years in the Le Guennec's garage . Mr Le Guennec has continued to insist that the artworks were gifts from his former employer in gratitude for his electrical work. He has now told Le Parisien newspaper ahead of his trial: 'I worked for Monsieur and Madame Picassso from 1970 to 1973. 'One day Jacqueline called me and said ""Here, this is for you"". 'I looked and saw it was sketches, drafts and other pieces from his studio. There were 271 of them, which I put in my garage. 'It was not until 2010 when I had a prostate operation that I decided to do something with them. 'I wrote to the Picasso Foundation and they asked me to bring them to Paris. 'Then we were accused of stealing them. But in fact they were a gift. Pictured left is drawing by Picasso in a notebook. Right, the artist himself - Pablo Picasso (1881 - 1973) 'We could have sold them at any time, but didn't because they had a sentimental value.' Mrs Le Guennec added: 'We are sure these artworks are our property and we are confident that our lawyers will prove that.' After the couple were charged Christine Pinault, spokeswoman for Picasso's son Claude, told of the 'astonishment' at the Picasso Foundation when Mr Le Guennec arrived with the haul of artworks in a suitcase. She said: 'He made an appointment to come and see us and arrived on September 9 with an unlocked suitcase full of paintings and sketches. 'We could hardly believe he had simply got on a train with something so valuable. 'He first claimed it was Picasso himself that had given them to him, but he didn't seem to be able to describe a single occasion when a painting was handed to him. 'When we asked him why he thought Picasso had been so generous, he told us simply that the artist must have thought he deserved them for all his hard work.' A drawing of a horse by Picasso, which was among the 'treasure trove' collection kept by the Le Guennecs . This picture shows 'Papier colle pipe et bouteille' which was also part of the hidden collection . Picasso's son Claude and five other relatives of the Spanish-born artist have dismissed Mr Le Guennec's claim that he could have received the paintings as gifts. Claude Picasso has insisted his father would 'never' have given such a large quantity of works to anyone. He told French daily Liberation: 'That doesn't stand up. These works were part of his life.' Picasso family lawyer Jean-Jacques Neuer added: 'Claude Picasso was astounded. He couldn't believe his eyes. 'Just about everybody has felt that way. When you have 271 Picasso works that were never seen, never inventoried, that's just unprecedented. The Le Guennecs are due to go on trial in Grasse, southern France, over the artworks, on February 10. Tney are charged with receiving stolen goods . 'The most important thing is re-discovering important artworks for the good of art history as a whole.' A spokesman for France's Central Office for the Fight against Traffic in Cultural Goods, part of the Interior Ministry, said the paintings were seized in 2010 and are being held in a secure location. The seized Picassos include a watercolour from his Blue Period, and nine cubist works which experts believe are worth £33 million alone. Also in the collection are portraits of his first wife Olga, as well as a number of gouaches and lithographs. The Le Guennecs are due to go on trial in Grasse, southern France, on February 10 charged with receiving stolen goods. Picasso, who lived from 1881 to 1973, is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century. He is the world's most stolen artist due to his prolific output and the value of his works. Picasso produced more than 20,000 works of art during his long career, but hundreds have been listed as missing, either because they were stolen or given away. The Art Loss Register lists 550 missing Picassos.","Pierre Le Guennec, 75, and wife Danielle, 72,  to appear in court next month .

"A Georgia mother killed her three children and then took her own life in an apparent murder-suicide at their home about 15 miles outside of Atlanta. Georgia. Kisha Holmes, 35, of Austell was found dead yesterday morning alongside her nine-month-old daughter, four-year-old son and ten-year-old son. The names of the children have not been released. A maintenance worker discovered the bodies in the family's apartment in the Walton Crossing housing community when he arrived to repair a clothes dryer. Kisha Holmes, 35, and her three children were found dead at their apartment in the Walton Crossing housing community in Austell, Georgia (pictured) Security personnel guarded the main entrance to the Walton Crossing apartments after Holmes was found dead alongside her nine-month-old daughter, four-year-old son and ten-year-old son . Cobb County police believe Holmes 'first took the lives of her three children and then her own'. The exact causes of death have not been released and it is unclear how long ago the killings occurred. The Cobb County Medical Examiner is conducting autopsies on the four bodies. Walton Crossing alerted residents that a family had died in one of the apartments in the complex by handing out letters to residents.

"There must be no such thing as jobs 'just for boys', the employment minister says today in a push to get more women into male-dominated industries. Esther McVey told MailOnline that she wants to increase female employment in engineering, science and construction so that children will not just know 'Bob the Builder, but Becky the builder, his work mate too'. She points to figures showing that if women started their own businesses at the same rate as men there would be an extra 150,000 firms every year. Employment minister Esther McVey said she wants to increase female employment in engineering, science and construction so that children will not just know 'Bob the Builder, but Becky the builder, his work mate too' Latest figures show that there are record numbers of women in work, hitting 14.4million in November. But ministers are concerned that too many women are put off from applying for jobs in successful and expanding industries because they are seen as men-only sectors. A campaign branded #NotJustForBoys will be launched to challenge stereotypes about the careers that young women can aim for. Miss McVey said: 'I want to see more women be able to make the most of the opportunities that are out there today and in the future. 'Despite a record number of women in work they are still unrepresented in many of the industries – for example engineering, science and construction – where they can be the role models in traditionally male-dominated jobs for the next generation.' There are just 272,000 women working in construction, compared to almost 2million men. However, since the post-crash lows seen in late 2012 - when building sites shed jobs - female employment in the industry has risen by 17 per cent while the number of male workers is only up by 3 per cent. 'I want to see more women make the most of the future growth and job opportunities in what once may have been considered non-traditional roles – so young children won't only know about Bob the Builder, but Becky the builder, his work mate too,' Miss McVey said. 'Women are getting on and making choices about the world of work that many of their mothers and grandmothers might never have considered for themselves.' Miss McVey will today visit Women in Construction, which helps women find work in the construction sector and are set to announce 20 new apprentice roles. Since the post-crash lows seen in late 2012 - when building sites shed jobs - female employment in the industry has risen by 17 per cent while the number of male workers is only up by 3 per cent . Only 7 per cent of engineering professionals are women, while the figure is just 20 per cent of people in broadcast media including photographers and camera operators. A quarter of science, engineering and production technicians are women. Miss McVey added: 'Let's not forget that if women set up businesses at the same rate as men – there would be an extra 150,000 starts-ups every year. 'I want to see even more women take advantage of Government job schemes so we can see more female Richard Bransons take on the business world – they can do it, it's not just for boys. 'Up and down the country the women of the UK have been staging a quiet revolution – they've been getting in work in unprecedented numbers. 'With record employment and almost 700,000 vacancies in the economy – I want to see as many young women as possible making the most of those opportunities to provide the security of a regular wage for themselves.' The push for more women in construction comes as Labour announced plans to encourage more house building by small firms. The party's housing spokeswoman Emma Reynolds said Labour would introduce a Help to Build scheme to allow small and medium-sized businesses to access lower-cost bank lending backed by Treasury guarantees. The proportion of homes built by SME builders has fallen from 34 per cent to 27 per cent since 2010, with a loss of an estimated 1,131 builders, Miss Reynolds said. Speaking to the Federation of Master Builders at a pre-election event in Westminster, Miss Reynolds said: 'Labour will boost small builders, increase house building and help make home ownership a realistic aspiration for the next generation.'","Esther McVey wants to end the idea that some industries are men-only .

"The Paris haute couture shows are the stuff of fashion dreams. The garments, some of which require 3,000 hours of work, are crafted with the red carpet in mind and are so bespoke that they don't even come with a price tag because if you're lucky enough to snap one up, budget is of no relevance. One of the most hotly-anticipated designers to showcase in the French capital tonight was Valentino.

"Princess, a pitbull-pug mix, saw her owner being attacked and ran to the rescue in Fort Worth, Texas . A 60-year-old woman was saved by her dog named Princess after two men grabbed her computer and shoved her against a fence. Princess, a pit bull-pug mix, saw the attack and ran to her owner's rescue in Fort Worth, Texas on January 20. The unnamed woman was carrying a computer out of her home when she was approached by the two men who attacked her. After the first man ran away with the woman's computer, the second pushed the woman against a fence, according to NBC DFW. Princess ran up to the man, bit him on the leg and scratched him on the face as he held the woman, police said. After being attacked, the man let the woman go and limped away. The Fort Worth Police Department posted a letter on their Twitter account on Tuesday congratulating the dog for her bravery. The letter read: 'A big congratulations and thank you to Princess for rescuing her mother and possibly saving a life! She's a big hero in our hearts and her owner's, too!' The force later tweeted a photo of Princess with a police officer and a man with a camera captioned, 'Princess ready for her first interview w/FWPD and @NBCDFW'. Police are still looking for the men who both escaped the scene. The man who was bitten by Princess is described as a black male, 45-50 years old and six feet tall. He was wearing a green jacket and brown sweatpants with jeans over them at the time of the attack. The other man is described as a Hispanic male, 24-30 years old, tall with a thin build. He was wearing a hoodie and dark pants at the time of the incident.

"Parents of 43 missing college students have angrily rejected the Mexican attorney general's declaration that their children were murdered. The male students disappeared last September near the southern city of Iguala after they were taken into custody by police and handed over to a drug gang, who killed them, burned the bodies and tossed their remains into a river. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said definitively for the first time yesterday that all the students were dead. During an emotional news conference last night, Murillo Karam cited confessions and forensic evidence that showed that the fire blazed for hours at a temperature sufficient to turn 43 bodies into ashes. Scroll down for video . Parents of 43 missing college students have angrily rejected the Mexican attorney general's declaration that their children were murdered. Some of the relatives are pictured above holding photographs of the students in front a banner that reads 'They took them alive, we want them back alive!' Families  accused the government of trying to wrap up the investigation leaving many questions unanswered . Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said definitively for the first time yesterday that all the students were dead . The male students disappeared last September near the southern city of Iguala after they were taken into custody by police and handed over to a drug gang, who killed them, burned the bodies and tossed their remains into a river . The remains in bags that were found in the river had traces of the dump where the fire occurred. Murillo Karam said the investigation 'gives us the legal certainty that the student teachers were killed in the circumstances that have been described'. He added they came to the conclusion through expert and witness testimony that  'beyond a doubt that the students were abducted and killed, before being incinerated and thrown into the San Juan river, in that order'. Relatives who marched on Monday with several thousand people in Mexico City to mark the four-month mark since the disappearance, accused the government of trying to wrap up the investigation leaving many questions unanswered. 'We don't believe anything of what they say,' said Carmen Cruz, mother of 19-year-old Jorge Cruz, one of the disappeared students. 'We are not going to allow this case to be closed.' The students, who were aspiring teachers attending a training college, vanished on September 26 and were attacked - allegedly under orders from detained, former mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife. DNA tests were able to only positively identify the remains of one of the students, which leaves little hope of finding the remaining missing students, pictured . The students, who were aspiring teachers attending a training college, were attacked in a gang-linked police attack - allegedly under orders from detained, former mayor Jose Luis Abarca, left, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda, right . Murillo Karam cited confessions and forensic evidence that showed that the fire blazed for hours at a temperature sufficient to turn 43 bodies into ashes. He is pictured speaking at the press conference . Lawyer Vidulfo Rosales, who is representing the families, presented a ten-point argument explaining why they believe the investigation must continue. The argument included a lack of conclusive forensic results. DNA tests were able to only positively identify the remains of one of the students, which leaves little hope of finding the remaining missing students. An Austrian laboratory assisting in the case has said it appears impossible to identify the others. 'We the parents repudiate the way in which today the attorney general has sought to close the investigation,' said Felipe de la Cruz, a spokesman for the relatives. 'We are not going to allow them to conclude or close the investigation,' he added, surrounded by activists and desperate parents. The latter are clinging to the belief that the students remain alive and are in the custody of Mexican security forces. His people do not want the probe to be closed because so far only one set of remains corresponds to those of the missing students, according to de la Cruz. Rosales noted that a number of key suspects remain at large. If detained, their testimony could shed new light on the official version of how the ordeal occurred. The families are set to bring forward a formal complaint on February 3 before the Committee on Enforced Disappearances at the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Relatives marched on Monday with several thousand people in Mexico City to mark the four-month mark since the disappearance .

Rosales noted that a number of key suspects remain at large. If detained, their testimony could shed new light on the official version of how the ordeal occurred.  A protester holds a picture of one of the 43 missing students during a march earlier this week . The Mexican government 'will have to respond for these events,' said Rosales. The conclusion was based on the testimony of a suspect arrested two weeks ago who said he was called to get rid of the students, in addition to 39 confessions, 386 declarations, 487 forensic tests, 16 raids and two reconstructions. The investigation has determined that a man named Felipe Rodriguez, arrested January 15, gave key testimony to the effect that the students were identified as members of Los Rojos, rivals of the Guerreros Unidos. Detainees in the crime said there were at least three from Los Rojos infiltrated among the missing students. But prosecutors have no proof of this. Prosecutors said Rodriquez was the head of the Guerreros Unidos hitmen squad and gave the order to kill the students. He and other suspects will be charged with murder. So far 99 people have been detained in connection with the crime including Abarca. Families of the students questioned the testimony of detained suspects, taking into consideration Mexican authorities' track record of coercing confessions. The case has sparked widespread protests in the four months since the students disappeared and forced the government to turn its attention from touting economic and education reforms to dealing with crime and insecurity . Mother, not pictured, of disappeared student Jorge Cruz, 19, said they are not going to allow the case to be closed . An analyst said the protests will likely continue while there is no unimpeachable evidence that the remains belong to the students. Riot police, pictured, walk past a burning patrol vehicle during a protest earlier this month . Murillo Karam denied that the army participated in or allowed the killings to happen, as victims' relatives have claimed. The case has continued to spark widespread protests in the four months since the students disappeared and forced the government to turn its attention from touting economic and education reforms to dealing with crime and insecurity. The attorney general's response did not help to quell the controversy. 'They pretty much gave the same story as they had given two months ago. There are not many additional details,' said analyst Alejandro Hope. 'They are searching for closure but I'm not sure they're going to get it.' Hope said the protests will likely continue while there is no unimpeachable evidence that the remains belong to the students. It also remains unclear why the gang members would think the students were rivals, and why they would have killed them even after learning they were not. 'We know the who, the what, the when and the where. We don't know the why,' Hope said. 'They have yet to tell a compelling story of why this happened. It doesn't matter how many people they detain - unless they answer that question, the whole thing will remain under a halo of mystery.'","Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam cited testimonies and forensic evidence that showed fire burned bodies into ashes .

"A rescue dog with droopy skin was given a £1,000 facelift to stop him from completely losing his sight. Rock, a two-year-old dog, was left in difficulty after his folds of skin meant his eyelids and forehead had began to curl into his eyes, leaving him in danger of going blind. Staff at Woodside Sanctuary in Plympton in Devon decided the only option was to operate on Rock, giving him a partial facelift and restructuring his eyes. Rock the bloodhound was given a £1,000 partial facelift and eye restructure after his droopy skin condition was causing his forehead and eyelids to fold into his eyes and leaving him at risk of going completely blind . The animal is now recovering and has found new owners who will adopt him once he is fit enough to be released. Helen Lecointe, manager at Woodside Sanctuary in Plympton, Devon, said Rock was already suffering from the condition - known as entropion -  when he was brought to the home. She said: 'We immediately saw that he was suffering from a nasty condition. 'Anyone who's had a lash in their eye will be sure to understand how painful this must have been 24/7. 'Rock is a lovely boy and, although he's feeling rather sorry for himself right now, his future wellbeing has been massively improved. 'We're extremely grateful to all the donors who enabled this to happen so quickly.' Rock is pictured at the sanctuary before his surgery, with his saggy folds of skin falling around his eyes . Following surgery Rock had to wear a collar to stop him scratching his face, and is now recovering . Animal lovers donated £1,000 to the sanctuary to fund the necessary surgery. John Hicks and his family fell in love with Rock while looking for a companion for their deerhound, Sage. Mr Hicks, 45, of Saltash, Cornwall, said: 'We've already got three cats and two dogs and wanted another big dog as a companion for our deerhound. 'We looked at three dogs beforehand at Woodside and the ones that got on with us and our dog didn't get on with cats whereas Rock gets on with everyone and everything. 'He is really friendly and, although he's got a presence, he is a big softy.' The number of operations to remove excess dog skin has increased by more than 80 per cent in four years. Linzi Saunders, from Woodside Sanctuary is pictured with Rock as he continues to recover from the surgery . Criticisms have been raised about the over-breeding of pedigree dogs following a BBC documentary in 2008 that exposed health problems among some of the most extreme cases. After the documentary experts called for breeds of dogs which displayed health problems, such as entropion, to be dropped from the show but the Kennel Club did not comply with the demand. In 2012 tests were launched at Crufts to check for conditions like this to ensure these breeds were not rewarded and to discourage breeding them for the characteristics that can cause them such discomfort. Ms Lecointe said: 'Like many wrinkle faced pedigrees, Rock is the result of ill-considered genetic breeding and the folds in his face were making his problem even worse.' Dawn Cornish, deputy manager of the sanctuary, said: 'Whilst Bloodhounds are highly prone to this condition, in Rock's case it was more severe and it was vital that he received this operation.' Dr Gert ter Haar, of the Royal Veterinary College, said the number of procedures had risen rapidly in the last few years. He said: 'We do not undertake these operations unless there is a medical reason to do so. 'We find some of them have excessive skin folds which can cause severe infections. It can cause blindness and if the folds cover the nose they cannot breath.'","Rock the bloodhound suffered from droopy skin that threatened his sight .

"Robert McElhill, 27, (pictured outside court) has been banned from owning dogs for 10 years after being found guilty of a string of animal neglect charges at City of London Magistrates Court . Dozens of terrified dogs were found living in squalor behind the doors of a £4m home in one of the UK’s most prestigious neighbourhoods. Police found the sprawling property, a stone’s throw from the homes of Robbie Williams, Elton John and Simon Cowell, had been overrun with animals. They discovered dogs and puppies of all shapes and sizes covered in their own excrement, barricaded in a stairwell and without access to water. Incredibly, the owners of the 10-bedroom mansion in London’s trendy Holland Park were still renting out rooms to paying guests. But one visitor – shocked by the overwhelming stench – tipped off the authorities after being woken in the night by dogs fighting in a locked yard. Another had already described the guesthouse as being occupied by the ‘hounds of hell’ in an online review and said he could not believe it was allowed to remain open. Yesterday, the owner’s grandson Robert McElhill, 27, was banned from owning dogs for 10 years after being found guilty of animal neglect. But the security guard, whose grandmother bought the property more than 60 years ago, was only fined a ‘token gesture’ of £340 towards their upkeep. This is despite leaving taxpayers with a bill of almost £100,000 for kennelling and vet fees after the dogs were seized and brought back to health. One veteran police dog handler said he was confronted with one of the worst scenes of his entire career when his team raided the house last June. Officers found 33 dogs of all shapes and sizes including a Great Dane ‘mix’, a Chihuahua, a Rottweiler and a Saluki, also known as an Arabian Greyhound. City of London Magistrates court was told that the semi-detached house, including McElhill’s grandmother’s bedroom, was in an ‘appalling’ state. Many of the windows were blocked, leaving the rooms dimly lit. There was no bedding for the animals which were locked in rooms in groups of two to six. Many of the dogs bore old and recent scars and a female Lurcher and her seven pups were locked in a room ‘awash’ with their excrement. There was even an 18 inch tall Chihuahua that was found locked in a cage just 19 inches high. Two other dogs were barricaded in the stairs and there was no clean water. Prosecutor Christian Wheeliker said the house was in a ‘filthy state’. Describing the arrival of police, he said: ‘The officer said he couldn't enter that room without stepping in faeces or urine. ‘None of the dogs had proper access to toileting, including the room that housed McElhill's grandmother.’ The appalling conditions were laid bare in videos shown to the court which documented rotting floorboards, fetid kitchen surfaces and excrement everywhere. The police officer holding the camera gasped audibly as he opened a door to discover the emaciated Lurcher and puppies. Scroll down for video .

One police dog handler said he was confronted with one of the worst scenes of his entire career at the house . McElhill was found guilty of six counts of animal neglect and four counts of ‘failing to prevent the causing of unnecessary suffering’ to animals. He was banned from keeping animals for 10 years. Pictured: A seized dog . PC Stephen Pinner said: ‘Overall, the premises and conditions that these animals were being kept in are some of the worst I have seen in my 34 years’ service in the police. ‘The smell and conditions were appalling.’ McElhill claimed he had been working 18 hours shifts for a security firm and his mother Beatrice would look after the dogs. But she said: ‘I just could not cope.’ Sentencing him, District Judge Paul Goldspring said he did not believe he deliberately set out to harm the dogs. He said: ‘He is someone who genuinely loves dogs, that love blinded him – it blinded him to his inability to look after the dogs. ‘They must have suffered some emotional distress. The dogs were in squalor and the risk of disease was obvious.’ McElhill was found guilty of six counts of animal neglect and four counts of ‘failing to prevent the causing of unnecessary suffering’ to animals. More than a third of the puppies and dogs seized from McElhill's family home were found to be underweight . McElhill claimed he had been working 18 hours shifts for a security firm and his mother Beatrice would look after the dogs. But she said: ‘I just could not cope.' The dogs were all seized from the home in the police raid . During the raid, police found a sandy-coloured Lurcher and seven puppies (pictured) in squalid conditions . He was banned from owning, caring, or trading dogs, under the Animal Welfare Act for 10 years. He was also ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work and to pay £1,600 prosecution costs, a £60 victims charge and £340 towards kennelling. All of the dogs were seized and placed in police kennels. Some have since been re-homed, but some remain in police hands. Speaking after the hearing, Sergeant Peter Madden said: ‘These dogs were living in appalling conditions with very limited space. ‘Many of them had no water and there was no dog food found inside the property. There was no outdoor access, no toys or any form of environmental enrichment and they had long nails indicating a lack of outdoor exercise. ‘Almost a third of the dogs were deemed to be underweight or very underweight and after just five weeks in police kennels the Lurcher, mother to the seven puppies, put on over 35 per cent of her bodyweight.’ The appalling conditions were laid bare in videos shown to the court which documented rotting floorboards, fetid kitchen surfaces and excrement everywhere. Incredibly, rooms were still rented out to guests at the B&B . PC Stephen Pinner said: ‘Overall, the premises and conditions that these animals were being kept in are some of the worst I have seen in my 34 years’ service in the police.‘The smell and conditions were appalling' As well as being banned from keeping animals for 10 years, McElhill, 27, was also ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work and to pay £1,600 prosecution costs, a £60 victims charge and £340 towards kennelling .","WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Environmental activist Emma Sheppard has been told she is likely to be jailed for setting three nail traps outside the Bristol police station that punctured the tyres of response cars . An environmental activist who used nail-filled pieces of plywood to put three police cars responding to emergency calls out of action is likely to be jailed. Emma Sheppard positioned three of the homemade traps outside a police station near Bristol on New Year's Eve, which led to the police vehicles' tyres being punctured. The devices were similar to those used by police to stop suspect's cars. The 33-year-old appeared at the Bristol Crown Court yesterday via video-link from Eastwood Park prison in Gloucestershire and admitted damaging the vehicles. Judge Martin Piction told Sheppard she would inevitable be jailed and said he would consider public protection issues when sentencing her next month. He then remanded her in custody. Sheppard, who is from Easton, in Bristol, is well known within green activist circles. In 2009 she was among a group of 18 activists who were found guilty of trying to shut down the Ratcliffe power station in Nottinghamshire. Her conviction and those of her co-accused were later quashed following revelations the group had been infiltrated by undercover police officer Mark Kennedy. Sheppard hammered nails into pieces of plywood which punctured the tyres of three police cars, including the one pictured above, that were responding to call outs on New Year's Eve . In 2009 Sheppard was among a group of 18 activists who were found guilty of trying to shut down the Ratcliffe power station in Nottinghamshire; the groups' convictions were later quashed . The court heard that Sheppard, of no fixed abode, put the devices outside a police divisional HQ in Emersons Green, Bristol. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Bevan said the 'stinger' devices rendered the police vehicles 'unusable on what is traditionally one of the busiest nights of the year'. He said Sheppard placed the devices on the road, 'knowing full well what the consequences could be'. Police have posted a £10,000 reward for information about known activist Huw 'Badger' Norfolk . Det. Insp. Bevan said: 'They posed a serious risk to our police officers as well as other road users and formed part of a reckless and dangerous plan.' Sheppard’s conviction is the first by detectives from Avon and Somerset's police's Operation Rhone. A squad was formed in December after police linked more than 100 arson and vandalism attacks on establishment targets that had occurred in and around Bristol and Bath during the last four years. The attacks, on police stations, banks and politician's cars, were suspected to have been carried out by anarchists. Det. Insp. Bevan said police could not say whether Sheppard was 'linked to other attacks'. The most costly incident among those being investigated by Operation Rhone officers was an arson at Avon and Somerset’s new firearms centre in August 2013 that caused £16 million in damages. According to The Guardian, police believe a small group are behind the attacks and have offered a £10,000 reward for information about well-known activist Huw 'Badger' Norfolk. Police want to speak to Norfolk about a vandalism attack at the Bristol Post in 2011 and an arson attack on a phone mast in January 2013. His whereabouts has been unknown since 2011.","Emma Sheppard is a known environmental activist in and around Bristol .

"A California father charged with murdering his 19-day old daughter is now also accused of sexually abusing her. Matthew Brendan Warner was arrested on Saturday morning after police discovered the body of his baby in the cab of a pickup truck in Newhall, Southern California, after he had initially reported her missing. The 30-year-old was already facing charges of murder, assault on a child causing death and torture, but yesterday prosecutors also charged him with committing a series of sexual offences on Ellorah Rose Warner. Scroll down for video . Matthew Warner was arrested on Saturday and charged with murdering his 19-day-old daughter but yesterday prosecutors also accused him of sexually abusing her . The 30-year-old and his wife reported Ellorah Rose Warner missing from their apartment complex on Friday prompting police to begin a search of the area; This picture of the pair was taken two days before her death . Outside court, family members on both sides of the baby's family took different sides over the case. 'No! It's not even conceivable. Not him,' Victoria Law-Thomson, Warner's mother, told NBC Los Angeles. Nan Allison, Warner's mother-in-law, made no attempt to defend him, saying: 'The idea that a 3-week-old child should have to worry about defending herself against her 30-year-old father is abhorrent to me.' Warner and his wife reported Ellorah missing from their home in Newhall last Friday. About 12 hours later police said they arrested Warner after he led them to his daughter's body. Ms Allison said her unemployed son-in-law had made a choice 'to get high'. Nan Allison, Warner's mother-in-law, made no attempt to defend him, saying: 'The idea that a 3-week-old child should have to worry about defending herself against her 30-year-old father is abhorrent to me' Warner was said to have later led police to a pickup truck where Ellorah was found inside the cab . She said Warner was already on probation for drugs charges and was a danger to his daughter. However, Ms Law-Thomson said she thought her son was clean and sober and hoped that her granddaughter had died as the result of an accident. After prosecutors added the sexual assault charges, Warner's bail was increased to more than $2 million. He faces a maximum penalty of life in state prison if convicted of all charges. Police initially searched the parent's home before locating the child in the truck. Authorities have not said who owns the vehicle. Warner's mother Victoria Law-Thomson said she thought her son as clean and sober and hoped that her granddaughter died as the result of an accident . Warner posted a picture of him holding the child on Facebook just two days before she wound up dead.

"The San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a payment of nearly $3 million to the family of a woman who was found dead in a stairwell 17 days after she disappeared from her hospital room. A building engineer checking the locked stairwell at San Francisco General Hospital found Lynne Spalding's body in October 2013. The 57-year-old woman was being treated for a bladder infection and was described as disoriented when she left her room. Lynne Spalding (pictured) was found dead in a stairwell 17 days after she disappeared from her hospital room . The city will pay $2.94 million and the University of California will pay $59,000. UC was named in the family's legal claim over Spalding's death because its doctors and nurses were involved in her care and monitoring. Spalding went missing from her bed Sept. 21. A building engineer conducting a quarterly inspection discovered her body Oct. 8 in the stairwell, which was 99 yards from her room and locked on the inside. The San Francisco coroner attributed Spalding's death to dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance likely related to chronic alcohol use but could not pinpoint when she died. Spalding's death sparked multiple investigations focusing on failures of communication between the hospital and sheriff's deputies - who provide security and conducted a haphazard search for the woman. A building engineer checking the locked stairwell at San Francisco General Hospital (pictured) found the body . Spalding was a British expat living in the U.S. and was an alcoholic when receiving treatment for the bladder infection. A doctor had instructed staff in writing that the patient was never to be left unattended and when she was, nurses were blamed for not acting on the orders. A report obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle last year found 'systematic' failures at the hospital and said officials there never worked out an emergency plan with the Sheriff's Department. That created the risk of a 'chaotic and poorly coordinated' response that led to Spalding's death, the report said.","Lynne Spalding, 57, was admitted to San Francisco General Hospital on September 19, 2013 .

"Two anti-Heathrow campaigners sent 8,000 noise complaints to the airport - with some arriving one hour before the aircraft was due to take off. The duo were using automated software to complain when a flight was due to fly over their homes near the airport. But officials at the airport caught them out when they failed to take into account the clocks going back in October leading to complaints being made about flights which were still on the ground. The airport now believes that dozens of complainants are using similar software to generate automatic email complaints when a plane was due regardless of the noise. Scroll down for video . Two anti-Heathrow campaigners were discovered using an automated email system to complain about aircraft noise after they failed to change their clocks in October - meaning the emails were sent an hour early . According to airport officials, two individuals were responsible for 7,888 complaints in 2014. The airport claims that just 37 people using the automated email system have lodged more than 28,000 complaints. The airport has seen the total number of noise complaints rise from 18,826 in 2013 to 94,114 last year. A spokesman said: 'We found out because when the clocks went back in October, they forgot to change the timing on their software, so we started receiving complaints exactly one hour before the plane took off.' However, John Stewart of the HACAN group which campaigns for noise reduction around Heathrow said: 'I think its unfortunate that many residents felt they had to resort to these kinds of machines, but unfortunately they have been left with no choice but to have them. 'I think that shows how disturbed people were by the noise from the flight paths. But unfortunately they have set their automatic machines to send out complaints before the aircraft even arrive. 'It is not something that we were aware of ourselves and I do have some sympathy with Heathrow. I think they were right to point this out, and I do think they recognise there is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.' It comes as a government survey found the number of people disturbed by aircraft noise doubled in the last decade. DEFRA, the Government department responsible for noise, said four per cent of the population - over 2 million people - now consider themselves badly affected by noise from aircraft. Another nine per cent said they are ‘moderately’ affected.

"A groom was forced to drink his wedding breakfast through a straw after being punched while on his stag do so hard that he broke his jaw in three places. Philip Bagnall, 33, was celebrating in Wigan, Greater Manchester, while dressed in an Elvis costume when he was hit in the face by Joshua McCormick, then 19, as he waited for a taxi. The unprovoked attack, which happened on November 15 last year, left father-of-three Mr Bagnall in hospital for five days, and meant he had to cancel his honeymoon and take time off work. Philip Bagnall, 33 (left and right with bride Vicky), was punched so hard by Joshua McCormick, then 19, while out on his stag do that he was left with fractures on both sides of his jaw. Mr Bagnall was forced to stay in hospital for five days afterwards and was released just in time for his wedding, but had to have the expensive breakfast liquidized and fed to him through a straw . Mr Bagnall was released from hospital in time to attend his wedding day, but had trouble saying his vows and making his speech, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The celebrations began as Mr Bagnall and his friends went to a dog racing track before heading back to his hometown of Ashton-in-Makerfield to continue the party. It was late in the evening, as Mr Bagnall was waiting for a taxi home, that McCormick struck. Graham Pickavance, prosecuting, said McCormick had drunk an 'astonishing' amount of alcohol before the assault, including five cans of lager, six Jaeger bombs and six vodka red bulls. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Mr Bagnall had to take unpaid time off work because of his injury, forcing his wife to pick up extra shifts to make ends meet, and forcing the couple to cancel their honeymoon . He then lashed out at Mr Bagnall for no apparent reason, sending the plastics factory worker falling to the floor, and leaving him with a total of three fractures on either side of his jaw. McCormick, now 20, was sentenced to two years in a young offenders' institution after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm . He had to take unpaid time off from his job because of the injuries, forcing bride-to-be Vicky to pick up extra shifts to make ends meet. He was also unable to enjoy his wedding day properly, and had to have his expensive wedding breakfast liquidized and fed to him through a straw. He struggled to read his vows and speech, and had to watch how much he was drinking because of the painkillers he was taking. He also said he had trouble looking after the couple's three children, because he was afraid they would touch his jaw. The court heard that McCormick, now 20, waited at the scene for a taxi to take Mr Bagnall away. He also handed himself in to police after a local newspaper ran CCTV images of him alongside an article detailing the extent of Mr Bagnall's injuries. After his arrest he told a probation officer 'I could have killed him', and showed genuine remorse and shame for his actions, according to his lawyer Steven Swift. He admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and was handed a two-year custodial sentence in a young offenders’ institution. Sentencing McCormick, Judge Brian Lewis said: 'This was completely unprovoked violence which people are sick of seeing on our streets. 'You hit him hard to the face for reasons which aren’t really clear. It was completely unprovoked, he went backwards onto the ground where he hit his head. Father-of-three Mr Bagnall said his injuries meant he had difficulty reading his vows and giving his speech, and also had to watch how much he drank on his big day because of medication he was taking . Mr Bagnall began celebrating with friends at a dog tack on November 15 last year before going back to his home town of Ashton-in-Makerfield to carry on celebrating when the attack took place . 'You said to the probation officer “I’m lucky I didn’t kill him"". You never said anything truer. 'This court is only too familiar with manslaughter cases that arise in the same way.' The judge also commended a stranger, Kayleigh Williams, who was also waiting for a taxi home and voluntarily went with Mr Bagnall in a cab to hospital. He praised her public-spirited action and awarded her £300 from public funds.","Philip Bagnall, 33, hit in the face as he waited for taxi while on stag do .

"The alleged Russian spy under arrest in New York is a former Moscow tax office employee, it was revealed today. Details of his past - he was born in a remote village notorious for a brutal gangland massacre - came as Russian politicians and ex-spies demanded US agents be expelled from Russia. Evgeny Buryakov, 39, rose quickly to switch to VneshEconomBank and was posted to work in South Africa as head of the institution's representative office, before being switched to the US. There was no reply at his flat in a block - pictured for the first time - on a prestigious Moscow avenue. Nor was there any sign of another alleged spy, Igor Sporyshev, 40, at his listed address in the Russian capital. Some of Buryakov's relatives still live in the village of Kuschevskaya village in Krasnodar region, which is more notorious in Russia for the slaying of 12 members of one family killed by local gangsters . Scroll down for video . A view to a bill: Evgeny Buyakov, who appeared in federal court in Manhattan this week, was previously a tax inspector in Moscow before joining a bank, where he worked when he was accused of being a spy . Taxing: This is the home of Evgeny Buyakov, at a prestigious address in Moscow. He worked in tax office number 40 in the city before becoming a bank worker - and moving to New York . Cold war scene: Igor Sporyshev, one of the two members of the ring to leave America before the FBI arrested Buyakov was not at his home, in a well-off area of the Russian capital . Buryakov arrived in Moscow from this backwoods village in Krasnodar region in 1999, first to work in tax office number 40, before joining the major Russian bank. It is unclear how long US federal prosecutors believe he has been a spy. He has a wife Marina, 35, and two children born in 2005 and 2008. Veteran KGB spy Mikhail Lyubimov - expelled from Britain in the Cold War - criticised the US over Buryakov's detention and the charging of two other Russian diplomats who were covered by diplomatic immunity. 'Usually in crisis situations which we are having now with the USA, spy stories are always good for those who are keen to heat up the conflict and spoil relations. 'I do not know the roots but this may be a provocation.' He forecast US diplomats would be expelled from Russia 'and that will be it'. He said: 'There is no drama. It is a much smaller drama than a conflict in Ukraine.' Another former spy Yury Kobaladze claimed the US was making more of a show out of the alleged espionage case than when glamorous Anna Chapman was expelled from the US five years ago. 'All was done in a quiet way and there was no damage to relations,' he said. 'Now it has been done very loudly. All was made public. For sure, there will be some steps from our side.' He stated: 'Russian intelligence is not doing anything worse than the Americans are doing in Russia. Diplomatic tension: Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is a former boss of the country's spy services. The arrest of the ring comes after a distinct chill in Washington-Moscow relations and is unlikely to improve them . Prestigious: Evgeny Buryakov worked out of these offices in Manhattan. Prosecutors allege he was using his job at VneshEconomBank as cover for recruiting sources of information and plotting to cause economic chaos . The logo of VneshEconomBank, where Evgeny Buryakov was the deputy representative in New York . 'I have always supported the idea that all conflicts in secret services - inevitable failures and arrests - should not lead to the complications in the relations between states. 'Unfortunately, we are in the period now when all is red hot. 'It is just a new drop which would not help the search for a compromise.' Senior politician Sergei Mironov urged the Kremlin to respond with 'an eye for an eye'. He claimed: 'Our secret services have notes about certain members of diplomatic service who are at odds with the law.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and US Ambassador to Russia John Tefft met on Wednesday for the second time since the scandal broke. 'The discussion of several issues of the bilateral agenda was continued,' said the Russian foreign ministry. The three were trying to find ways to cause an economic meltdown, according to court documents. The men allegedly wanted to 'destabilize' high frequency trading systems, which were blamed for the Wall St 'Flash Crash' of 2010. The men also moaned to each other that being a modern day spy was nothing like James Bond films, and that they longed for a more glamorous lifestyle, the criminal complaint reveals. The FBI began investigating the men in 2010 after ten Russian spies living in the US were arrested, including red-haired femme fatale Anna Chapman. When Buryakov was arrested and appeared before a federal judge prosecutors said: 'His life here is a deception.' During the Flash Crash the Dow Jones lost 1,000 points within minutes only to bounce back right away, sparking fears that automated or 'robot' trading could be vulnerable to hackers or terrorists. All three men are accused of trying to gather information on such high frequency trading and Exchange Traded Funds (ETTs), or bundles of shares, by recruiting women who worked in finance and others linked to a major university in the city. They also tried to get information on US sanctions against Russia and alternative energy sources being developed in America. In a conversation secretly taped by the FBI in May 2013, Sporyshev asked Buryakov about what questions he can give to other agents working for an unnamed Russian media organisation for intelligence-gathering. According to the charges in federal court in Manhattan: . Buryakov replied that they can ask about ETT and 'how they are used, the mechanisms of use for destabilisation of the markets'. He says: 'Then you ask them what they think about limiting the use of trading robots... and about the potential interest of the participants of the exchange to the products tied to the Russian Federation.' According to the criminal complaint, the three spies spoke to each other in code to set up their meetings and claimed they had an umbrella or a ticket for the others. In person Buryakov would pass Sporyshev a bag, a magazine or a piece of paper with information hidden inside it. They met in the open air so 'the risk of effective surveillance was reduced relative to an indoor location'. In a separate conversation, in April 2013, Podobnyy fantasized about being James Bond, saying: 'The fact that I'm sitting with a cookie right now at the chief enemy spot. 'F***! Not one point what I thought then...not even close. (unintelligible) movies about James Bond. 'Of course, I wouldn't fly helicopters. But, pretend to be someone else at a minimum.' Sporyshev replied: 'I also thought that at least I would go abroad with a different passport.' Buryakov was denied bail because he was a flight risk. He is accused of acting as an undeclared foreign spy among other offences and faces 15 years in jail if convicted. Sporyshev and Podobnyy are charged with aiding him in his activities. If he is a spy, it is hardly Buryakov's most dangerous association. He is a native of a village where one of Russia's most notorious mafia murders took place in 2010. Mob territory: Buyakov is from the remote Russian  village of Kushchevskaya (left)  where mob boss Sergei Tsapok (right) wiped out a dozen family and friends in a mafia hit in 2010, because a rival was challenging him . Godfather Sergei Tsapok told in a chilling courtroom boast in 2013 how he and his mobsters wiped out a dozen people, including four children aged from nine months to 14, in a murder spree which stunned the country. Farmer Serever Ametov, 51, had invited family and friends for a party in the village of Kushchevskaya - where Buryakov was born and raised - to celebrate Russia's National Unity Day in November 2010 where they were slaughtered by the ruthless Tsapok and his gang. After he was sentenced to life in prison, Tsapok calmly told the court that Ametov's business was 'going well' and he was 'in my way'. 'He was ruining my authority. So I wanted to make him suffer himself, and see how his family is suffering,' he said. 'We dragged him into the main room - he was still breathing - and making sure that he saw everything, we killed everyone else in front of his eyes. 'Then we checked the clock and were really surprised - it only took us ten minutes.' Tsapok's mother Nadezhda was jailed last year for six and a half years for fraud. The village is in the same region where the Russian Winter Olympics were held last year.","Evgeny Buryakov is alleged to be one of three-strong spy ring operating out of Manhattan for the Russian secret service .

"These images show the enormous scale of the world's biggest saw - capable of mining more than 4,500 tons of coal per hour. Weighing in at 45,000 tons, the monster saw can slice its way through virtually anything, including huge mountains made entirely of coal. The colossal piece of machinery, known as a bucket wheel excavator, is so big it takes 27 miners just to operate it at any one time. Scroll down for video .

At the coal face: The enormous bucket wheel excavator (pictured) is capable of mining more than 4,500 tons of material per hour . All weather performance: Despite its effectiveness at mining, the bucket wheel excavator's hulking mass means it can only travel one mile every three hours . The huge contraption can be found at the world's biggest single coal excavation site, the Bogatyr Mine near the city of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan. Incredibly, the diameter of the saw alone spans nearly 12 metres - about the same height as a four- storey building - while a single machine can cost up to £66million to produce. Its hulking mass and height of 45 metres means it can only travel one mile every three hours.

Russian photographer, Alexander Popov, 34, captured images of the contraption whilst on an assignment to take pictures of the Kazakhstan mining industry. Mr Popov said: 'I have never seen a machine as big as this one although I have seen many powerful machines in the past. 'I got to see the saw as part of photography assignment for the Kazakhstan mining industry. I couldn't believe its size when I got up close. 'It is used in the mining of coal and can actually mine 4,500 tons of coal per hour, it really is an extraordinary piece of equipment. A miner monitors a screen in an operating room high up in the bucket wheel excavator. The saw is so big it requires 27 people to operate it at any one time . Don't look down: The enormous scale of the contraption is shown in this image taken from the top of the 45 metre-high structure . Mr Popov  was granted a rare opportunity to picture the giant saw and said he was left in 'awe of its power and design' 'I was not scared to get so close but was more in awe of its power and design.' About 40 million tons of coal is taken from the Bogatyr mines every year, accounting for 40 per cent of the nation's coal output. In 1985 it entered the Guinness Book of Records for being the world's largest single coal mine when 56.8 million tonnes of coal were taken from the ground.","The 45,000 ton piece of machinery can be found at the Bogatyr Mine near the city of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan .

"A prison chaplain who claims police deliberately broke his leg has been awarded $4 million (£2.6m). Christopher Graham, a Corrections Department chaplain, was assaulted by police who attended an incident at his apartment, the New York Daily News has reported. A jury at Manhattan Civil Supreme Court in Brooklyn, New York took just 50 minutes to award Mr Graham $3.95m. NYPD officers attended an incident at Christopher Graham's home in Septmeber 2010 (file photo) The incident happened in September 2010 when Mr Graham and the mother of his children got into an argument and she called the police claiming he had hit her with with the butt end of a machete - something he denies. Mr Graham said police arrived at their apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and attacked him. 'They pulled [my] hat off my head and pulled dreadlocks out of my head,' he said. 'They slammed me to the floor and held me down. 'One of them was stepping on my neck and my face. The other one was trying to break my leg. 'He was turning my leg, left and right,' Christopher Graham said. 'I was screaming and banging on the floor. Then I heard a snap. 'Even after my leg breaks they were still beating my ass,' the chaplain said. According to the New York Daily News, Mr Graham, 51, said he didn't tell the officers what he did for a living but one officer saw the ID hanging from his neck. 'Then everything changed,' Mr Graham said. 'They thought I was some thug, but now I'm a state chaplain. 'I knew from the minute this happened I would sue because I know who I am. I did not do anything.' The misdemeanor assault, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon, resisting arrest and harassment charges against Mr Graham were later dropped, his lawyer, Raymond Gazer, said. Following a trial this month, the jury needed less than an hour to decide on the substantial damages. Mr Graham's left tibia and fibula were fractured and he underwent two surgeries. He now suffers from post-traumatic arthritis. Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for Corporation Counsel, said the city is 'evaluating all of our options for challenging the verdict'. 'We review, in a variety of ways, all allegations of officer misconduct,' Deputy Chief Kim Royster told the New York Daily News. 'A [verdict in] a civil case does not constitute a finding or even evidence that an officer has engaged in any misconduct.'","Christopher Graham from Brooklyn claims police broke his leg on purpose .

"An Irish woman has become the first adult to undergo an operation to insert magnets in her back to combat a severe curvature of her spine. Deirdre McDonnell, from Drogheda, County Louth, spent 30 years in pain after being diagnosed with scoliosis. Surgeons performed the pioneering MAGEC rod operation on the 34-year-old, inserting magnetic rods into her spine. The procedure, also known as the magnetic expansion control system, involves screwing the rods into the spine. The rods can then be controlled externally in order to correct the curvature of the spine. Up until now the £15,000 operation has only been performed on children, as it was only thought to be effective for early onset scoliosis - typically diagnosed before the age of 10. Scroll down for video . Deirdre McDonnell, 34, from Drogheda, County Louth, is thought to be the first adult in the world to have a pioneering operation to insert magnetic rods in her spine to correct her scoliosis, left. Right, after surgery . The 34-year-old was diagnosed as a newborn and underwent her first operation when she was just six weeks old. The condition, which causes an abnormal curvature of the spine, caused Miss McDonnell's spine to bend in the shape of a 'C', curved at 130 degrees, left. Since her operation she is standing tall for the first time, right . Following the success of Miss McDonnell's surgery, specialists are now hopeful the bone implant will help other adults, many of whom have undergone a number of unsuccessful and painful invasive operations in an attempt to straighten and lengthen their spine. 'The operation has completely changed my life,' Miss McDonnell said. 'Before, I could only walk short distances without being in pain but now I love to walk everywhere. 'After more than 30 years of operations and taking painkillers, I'm finally hopeful for the future.' When she was just six weeks old, Miss McDonnell underwent her first operation. She was diagnosed with congenital scoliosis, which affects around one in 10,000 newborn babies. Her spine was so malformed that doctors warned she wouldn't live past the age of seven. Over the next ten years, she underwent eight painful operations as doctors battled to save her life. Beating the odds, Miss McDonnell survived childhood and trained at college to become a teacher. But the secondary effects of her scoliosis eventually left her unable to work. She said: 'Because my spine was curved at 130 degrees, it formed into a C-shape and my lungs didn't have room to expand so they never grew to full size. 'At my worst, my lungs were operating at only 30 per cent of what they should have been. 'This meant that I was constantly poorly with pneumonia and chest infections. Doctors said they didn't know what else they could do. 'Things got so bad that my doctor told me that if he didn't operate, I'd be dead within 10 years.' Although MAGEC rod technology has existed since 2011, doctors initially didn't see it as an option for Miss McDonnell as it had previously only been performed on children. The pioneering MAGEC rod operation involves surgeons inserting magnetic rods, pictured, screwing them into the patient's spine . Doctors are then able to externally control the magnetic rods to help straighten the spine (stock picture) However, after running out of options, doctors decided to operate. Tallaght Hospital in Dublin was able to secure funding from the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the 34-year-old underwent the three-hour operation in June last year. Over the following months, her spine was straightened at regular intervals. Magnetic Expansion Control treatment is a way of straightening a curved spine. It works by inserting an adjustable magnetic growing rod into a patients back. This can then be controlled using an external control - this avoids the need for further surgery. The internal rod is lengthened using the magnetic remote control outside the body. This means the spine can be very gradually straightened. Usually, the patient is required to return to hospital about every six weeks to have their spine straightened by a few more millimetres. This process continues until the patient has reached their final height. Until now the procedure has only be performed on children, with experts believing it would only be successful in those patients who are newly diagnosed with scoliosis. Now fully recovered, Miss McDonnell says she is looking forward to a healthy, happy future with her boyfriend, solicitor Robbie Slattery, 32. 'I'm no longer in pain, and I feel so much more confident in myself,' she said. 'Even little things like being able to wear pretty dresses or sit comfortably have made such a change. 'I feel so lucky to have been able to have this operation - it really has changed my life. 'Before my dad passed away in 2009, he told me that he hoped I'd one day get my dream of living a normal life. I just hope I'm making him proud.' Consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Tallaght Hospital, Doctor Patrick Kiely, said: 'This is a big step forward for us. 'The largest benefit of MAGEC rod technology is that it removes the need for repeat operations. 'With the rod, once the initial procedure has been carried out, the patient doesn't have to undergo any more incisions. 'The spine is straightened externally using a remote control, which is painless and is performed without anaesthesia. 'This in turn minimises the risk of infection and limits the impact of the procedure on the patient.' Scoliosis comes from the Greek word 'skoliosis' which means 'crooked'. Symptoms of the condition include a curved spine, prominent ribcage or shoulder blades and uneven arm and leg lengths. Miss McDonnell, with her boyfriend Robbie, underwent the three-hour operation in June last year. Scoliosis comes from the Greek word 'skoliosis' which means 'crooked' She said: 'I'm no longer in pain, and I feel so much more confident in myself. I feel so lucky to have been able to have this operation - it really has changed my life' It is estimated that 273 million people worldwide suffer from the condition, including Olympic runner Usain Bolt. In the UK alone, approximately 45,000 children have scoliosis, with many having to undergo up to 20 corrective surgeries during their lifetime - at a massive £20,000 per procedure. The MAGEC rod, which is manufactured in California by Ellipse Technologies, aims to not only change lives, but also cut costs by removing the need for repeat surgeries. Vice president of Ellipse Technologies, Robert Martin, said: 'Magnetic rod technology has really revolutionised the treatment of scoliosis. 'Analysis shows that eliminating the need for repeat surgeries reduces cost dramatically. 'Thanks to the success of Deirdre's operation, we are hopeful that the operation will be performed on more adults and help to change their lives too.' Laura Counsell, National Director of the Scoliosis Association and the British Scoliosis Research Foundation, added: 'To my knowledge, Deirdre is the first adult to have this operation. 'It's certainly a very innovative way of using technology that was originally designed for children between the ages of six and 11.'","Deirdre McDonnell was diagnosed with scoliosis as a newborn baby .

"It's worth preparing for the worst of you are travelling to Bangkok as the Thai capital has the highest number of cases where the British Consulate has stepped in to help out Britons in trouble. In research released by the Foreign Office for 2014, Bangkok emerged as the destination where most Britons found themselves in trouble on holiday, with the need for medical advice and attention the biggest reason. Paris and Malaga followed Bangkok in the list, but both had almost a quarter of cases compared to that of the the Far Eastern city, where there were around 8,000 cases of Britons requiring overseas help. Scroll down for video . A total of 84,000 British citizens required help from the Consulate last year around the world, ranging from medical and illness assistance, to help with arrests and lost property. The report looked at each month of 2014, dissecting what cases were looked at where British government assistance was required. As far as drug arrests were concerned, Spanish party-city Malaga topped the pile on the highest number of Britons requiring assistance with drug-related offences, with around 50 cases recorded. Bangkok was again up there with around 33 cases, followed by the city of love Paris and Mexico  recording 33 cases apiece. Bangkok has the highest number of Britons requiring British Consulate help in the world, with most concerning receiving adequate medical treatment . The summer season sees a dramatic increase in the number of drug-related offences - in July alone 150 Britons were arrested around the world adding more work for the foreign office. Poor hygiene in Thailand contributes to Bangkok being ahead of everywhere else when it comes to cases of Britons needing hospital attention. And of course, with the language barrier often leading to confusion, it's little surprise the British Consulate is called upon to mediate and ensure the right treatments are given. Those countries that have a buzzing nightlife and club scene were also unsurprisingly high in the list where hospital treatment was required. Malaga again made the top five, alongside Tenerife, Palma and Alicante. Numbers lower than five in the research were averaged between one and five, and so given as three for reporting purposes. The clubbing scene appears to be linked to drug arrests, with more Britons arrested for these offences in Malaga than anywhere else . A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told MailOnline Travel: 'In light of the risk of unprovoked attacks you should be cautious and take care, especially at night. 'Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Some British nationals in Thailand have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, resulting in some suicides. 'Be aware of the possibility of credit card fraud. Don’t lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming in Thailand. Where possible use an ATM within a bank and always protect your PIN. 'Be careful to observe demarcation lines between shops and stalls, particularly in market areas and at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Taking items from one shop’s area to another may be treated as suspected theft. 'Be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers. Foreigners have had items snatched by thieves on motorbikes when walking along busy streets or travelling in open transport like tuk tuks. If you travel by bus, make sure cash and valuables you have are kept securely. There have been incidents where passengers have had items taken from bags while asleep. 'Gem scams are common. There have been reports of visitors buying gems for inflated prices from seemingly respectable establishments then later finding out the stones are worth a tiny fraction of the purchase price. 'You should report any incidents of crime to the Thai police before leaving the country.'

"When you weigh a whopping 36 stone, it’s probably not the brightest idea to go wandering across a frozen lake. And this moose found itself in a spot of serious trouble when the ice collapsed below and the water began to freeze around it as it struggled to get out. But help was at hand in the shape of a group of kind-hearted locals. Armed with just a chainsaw and rope, a team of eight people freed the female moose in a heroic feat. A terrified moose slipped through ice and was trapped in frozen Muncho Lake for 45 minutes before an incredible rescue . The female moose, weighing nearly 36 stone, bobbed her head above the icy water and awaited to be freed from the ice . Passing travellers, truck drivers and locals came to her rescue using a chainsaw and rope . The animal had been trapped in frozen Muncho Lake in northern British Columbia, Canada for 45 minutes before a group of passing travellers, truck drivers and locals spotted her bobbing head above the ice. They started off by using a chainsaw to cut the ice around her, and then tied a rope around the trapped moose before they pulled her to safety after 15 minutes and four attempts. The rescue was caught on camera by Canadian wildlife and nature photographer, Chris Gale, who spied the moose in the lake while he was on a trip with friends Ryan, Jason, and Matthew. Gale, 31, from Fort Nelson, BC, said: 'Every spring my friends and I go on a river boating trip up the Alaska Highway and as we were driving by Muncho Lake we noticed a bunch of people on the lake and a head of a moose sticking out of the ice. 'In the spring time, when the snow starts to melt, the ice on the lake starts to get rotten. So, as this moose walked out onto the ice, she fell through with no way out. 'I have never seen anything like it.' Rescuers cut ice around her and then tied a rope around the trapped animal before a team of eight pulled her out by hand . The rescue took four attempts before she was successfully pulled free from the frozen lake . Lucky to be alive! Once the moose was freed and the rope was cut from her neck she had a few injuries from the incident . Working on perilously thin ice and with a potentially aggressive moose, the rescuers were well aware of the challenging conditions they faced. Saving the moose was dangerous and the rescuers were all worried about their friend Matthew, who they hoped did not slip through the ice while trying to get the rope around the animal's neck, said Chris. 'The ice was so rotten and the lake was particularly deep in this spot, so we tied a rope around Matthew's waist in case he fell through the surface,' he said. 'We sent him out on the ice as he was the smallest guy and we hoped the ice would support him. 'The moose was scared at first because one of the guys had a chainsaw cutting a trail in the ice, but once we got her out she calmed down and let us cut the rope off.' Working on perilously thin ice and with a potentially aggressive moose, the rescuers were well aware of the challenging conditions they faced . Chris Gale, a Canadian wildlife and nature photographer (above), photographed the ordeal as his friends rescued the animal . Chris said the moose walked into the mountains and stopped to look back 'like she was saying thanks' before continuing her journey . Following the ordeal, many people have hailed Chris and his friends as heroes for saving the animal, he said. 'We were just doing what anyone would do,' said Chris. 'After we got her out of the ice, Matthew cut the rope, and then she simply walked into the mountains stopping to look back at us like she was saying thanks, then she continued on her journey. 'I would just like to say that this kind of thing happens a lot on frozen lakes around the world, we just happened to be in the right place at the right time when this moose fell through, she was lucky.'","Female moose slipped and fell in frozen Muncho Lake .

"Michael Wenham (pictured) murdered the young prostitute as he was struggling to cope with a botched penis enlargement surgery . A father-of-three recovering from a failed penis enlargement operation has been found guilty of stabbing a young prostitute to death. Michael Wenham, aged 36 years, murdered sex worker Karolina Nowikiewicz with a Stanley knife in her flat in Slough, Berkshire, last February. The killing came as he was struggling to cope after a botched penis enlargement operation reduced his penis from five inches to three inches in length. Following the seemingly unprovoked attack, he lay her face-down on her bed, showered himself clean and called his wife and the police, the court heard. Wenham had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but pleaded not guilty to murder. However, a jury today found him guilty unanimously following an eight-day trial. Reading Crown Court was told that at the time of Ms Nowikiewicz's death on February 17 last year, married Wenham was recovering from unsuccessful surgery on his genitals, carried out in the U.S. in late 2013. The jury was told that Wenham still had a dressing on his penis which had affected his sex life with wife of eight years Dawn and that he was self-conscious about the size of his genitalia. On the day of the killing, Wenham bought a pay-as-you-go mobile phone from an Argos store so he could arrange a meeting with a prostitute. The IT contractor had also called in sick to work before heading to a hardware store and buying a Stanley knife, disposable gloves and plastic sacks which he used in the killing. When the first woman he tried was unavailable, he booked to see Ms Nowikiewicz, arranging to meet her at her flat, where she worked as a prostitute to fund her studies. Wenham, who was working on a project for the Office of National Statistics in Southampton, had been not taking his medication for depression in the days before the killing. 'The killing was utterly premeditated, planned and clinically executed,' Alan Blake, prosecuting, told the jury of six men and six women. Michael Wenham, pictured far right with his wife Dawn and their two children. The father-of-three has been found guilty of murdering a prostitute after having a failed penis enlargement operation . Polish prostitute Karolina Nowikiewicz (pictured) died after Wenham sliced open her neck, cutting her major arteries . The jury at Reading Crown Court was told that the killing of Ms Nowikiewicz (pictured) was 'premeditated, planned and clinically executed' 'Attacking her from behind, he sliced open her neck, cutting through her major arteries and her spinal chord. There was no evidence that she had been able to even try to defend herself. 'The first prostitute he tried was unavailable. Tragically for Karolina, he booked to see her instead. There is no evidence to suggest that they had ever met before. 'Having killed Karolina and left her face-down on her bed, the defendant washed himself in the bathroom, placed the bloody knife in a drawer in the bedroom, went outside and called the police to admit to what he had just done. 'Although the victim was a prostitute both psychiatrists seem to agree that this was not in fact a sexual killing, in that there was no evidence of sexual assault, consensual sexual activity or even arousal. Wenham's wife Dawn (pictured) told the court he had called her and told her he had killed a prostitute not long after committing the act . 'Karolina was chosen because her job made her an easy target.' In a phone call to his wife Dawn following the killing, Wenham said: 'Hi, it’s me, I’ve done a stupid thing, I’ve killed someone, I’m really sorry, I’ve killed someone.' He then begged her not to tell the couple’s two boys, aged six and five. They also have a one-year-old daughter. During the trial, evidence given by Mrs Wenham revealed the scale of her husband's insecurities regarding his penis. Self-conscious Wenham would ask his wife to tell him he had a small penis during sex and to mock him for his size. The court heard his penis was reduced to three inches following the botched enlargement operation. Mrs Wenham told the jury how her husband enjoyed being spanked and liked the idea of her having sex with a well-endowed man. The court heard he also enjoyed dressing up in women's clothes and being dominated and he had a smoking fetish. Mrs Wenham told the court: 'He likes me to degrade him. He would ask me to say things to him like what a small penis he had and just generally sort of put him down. 'He liked the idea of me going with another man more well endowed than he is.' The court heard Wenham paid around £15,000 for the penis enlargement operation because he wanted to make it broader. However, he ended up losing two more inches - leaving him with a three-inch penis. She told the jury the couple went to a swingers club before he flew to Philadelphia in America for the operation in December 2013. They had group sex with another couple. Mrs Wenham said: 'He asked me to ask the other man to have sex with me, but I said that was a step too far.' Defending, Pavlos Panayi QC, asked: 'He felt he might lose you if he could not satisfy you in the way he had seen you satisfied by this couple?' Mrs Wenham replied: 'Yes.' Mr Panayi said: 'Even in the face of his massive insecurities, he was saying you should do that again.' Mrs Wenham replied: 'Yes.' The jury also heard that Wenham had fantasies about becoming a serial killer, killing radical Muslim cleric Anjem Choudhry and mere hours before his attack on Miss Nowikiewicz, had emailed MI5 offering his help in infiltrating terrorist networks. Psychiatrist Professor Seena Fazel said Wenham had told him the weekend before the attack he had thought about assassinating radical Muslim cleric Choudary and also about becoming a serial killer. 'He told me he was starting to think about ways to kill Islamic extremists,' said Professor Fazel. 'He mentioned to me a renowned cleric in London. He talked about it in the context of becoming a serial killer.'

"The man who has gained internet notoriety as Angry Dad thanks to his two trouble-making sons, has spoken out about his reluctant rise to fame. Videos of Mark Orval, 45, from Melbourne, losing his temper over everything from too much chili in his dinner to being busted at KFC with a hangover have received over one million views after his two sons started posting them online. Mr Orval said his sons Mitchell, 18, and Dylan, 21, have been secretly filming his expletive-laden tirades on their smartphones for a long time but they only recently started sharing them beyond their circle of friends. 'These two s***heads have been doing this for five, six, seven years,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Mark Orval, 45, has become an internet sensation  thanks to his two sons and their Youtube channel Angry Dad . Dylan, 21 (right), said he and his brother Mitchell, 18, (left) have always enjoyed provoking their father and filming his reactions but only recently starting posting them online . 'Thank god they've smashed and lost a great number of iPhones, because there would have been hundreds of videos I know they'd get so much pleasure in putting up now.' The 'Angry Dad' clips have had more than one million views between them on Facebook and YouTube, and have attracted plenty of fans online. He said he first realised he'd gone viral when his sons tagged him in a video they had uploaded, which had more than 2000 likes. They then made a Facebook page and a YouTube channel and #AngryDad has since taken off. Mr Orval said he has been recognised on the street before, but he had resigned himself to the humiliation. 'It's just so embarrassing, in all honesty, having people recognise you as someone who yells at your kids with all those expletives,' he said. 'But it says a bit about society that people can relate. 'It's not ideal, the last thing I want is this stuff spread around but what can I do? 'You try getting followed around with a camera, it's just ridiculous.' Mr Orval said he had to have an awkward conversation with his boss about the videos, but apart from the embarrassment the videos hadn't caused him too much trouble in his professional life. 'I work for a media company, I'm one of the senior executives there, and it's almost embarrassing to have to explain it to him,' he said. 'People at work have seen it, but at the end of the day I keep my private life and professional life separate. 'And they don't have to live with my two little pr***s as kids.' 'These two s***heads have been doing this for five, six, seven years,' Mr Orval said of Dylan (left) and Mitchell (right) constantly chasing him with a camera . He said he first realised he'd gone viral when his sons tagged him in a video they had uploaded, which had more than 2000 likes . Of all the videos they've filmed, he said he was most annoyed when his sons followed him to KFC when he was hungover and had lied to say he was getting sushi. 'My wife is a fitness fanatic and getting caught at KFC, having Mitchell jump out from behind a garbage bin and have him film it… it's not worth going through the pain,' he said. But his wife Sharon just thinks the situation is payback for the trouble he used to give her father when he was Mitchell and Dylan's age. 'She feels sorry for me in all honesty,' Mr Orval said. 'She said the other day that this is all karma for the hassle I used to give her dad when I was 18, 19, 20.'

"Police divers have searched a Gold Coast property belonging to the mother of pop star Rikki Lee Coulter for the body of a missing millionaire's wife, Novy Chardon. Police divers searched dams on the farm Advancetown in the Gold Coast hinterland for the body of Novy Chardon, 34, the fifth wife of a millionaire who is in prison for raping a teenage girl. It is the second major search for the Indonesian-born 34-year-old following her disappearance in February 2013 from the Mt Nathan mansion in the Gold Coast hinterland she shared with John Chardon, a multi-millionaire industrial lubricants manufacturer. Scroll down for video .

In March last year, police searching Mr Chardon's property excavated a white utility buried under earth, sparking fears the missing woman might have been entombed in the vehicle. Mr Chardon, 68, was in Indonesia with the couple's two young children at the time of the last search. He was subsequently convicted on unrelated offences last August for molesting and raping a friend's daughter when she was a 15-year-old schoolgirl between 1998 and 1999. A major Liberal National party donor once praised in the Queensland state parliament and the principal of Candan Industries lubricant suppliers, the now disgraced John Chardon is serving a six year jail sentence for child molesting.

POlice (pictured during the search at Mt Nathan last year) found nothing but resumed their search on Wednesday at another Gold Coast property, which belongs to pop star Rikki Lee Coulter's, mother, where they sent divers in to the dams . Police and about 50 SES volunteers on Wednesday began searching an unoccupied 3.6km property at Advancetown, just 17km south of Chardon's former Mt Nathan home, which had links to a 'person of interest'. Regional crime co-ordinator Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said the operation was a body search. 'We're searching for Novy's remains', he told the Gold Coast Bulletin. Supt Hutchinson later said that not items of interest had been located, but the investigation would continue. 'Although we came up empty-handed today, our determination to solve this case remains as strong as ever,' he said. After Ms Chardon vanished two years ago, her car was found dumped several suburbs away near Nerang Train Station. No longer alive: Detectives searching Rikki Lee Coulter's mother's property on Wednesday admitted they are looking for the body of missing Novy Chardon (above) This is the site  where the buried vehicle feared to hold the entombed body of Novy Chardon was found in the Mount Nathan yard in March last year . Jailed: Industrial lubricants millionaire John Chardon, 68, (above) was jailed for unrelated charges after his fifth wife's disappearance when police successfully prosecuted him for molesting and raping his friend's teenage daughter . SES volunters helped police search a Gold Coast property last year for Novy Chardon and were again out in force on Wednesday looking for the missing mother of two . Police took clothing and boots belonging to John Chardon from the property on the Gold Coast last year . Just two days after his wife disappeared, John Chardon took their two young children on a pre-planned business trip to Indonesia. He has always maintained his innocence of her murder. He remained overseas for several weeks and at the time said Mrs Chardon had gone missing before and denied playing any part in her disappearance, despite previously being named in court as the chief suspect. Put on trial last year for molesting and raping the daughter of a friend while she was a schoolgirl more than 15 years ago, Chardon denied the charges, claiming it was the teenage girl who offered him sex and he had turned her down after getting legal advice on the ramifications of sleeping with a minor. He did admit he started a secret cash-for-sex relationship with the teenager once she came of age. He continued to protest his innocence even after a jury of 12 found him guilty of six sex offences including rape and attempted rape.","Police have searched a Gold Coast farm for body of Novy Chardon, 34 .

"An author has claimed he can help any woman land the man of her dreams in just 60 days thanks to his dating techniques. Blake Lavak, 53, who grew up in Long Island, New York, and now lives in London, says his advice is based on methods that have been proven to work throughout history. He says his book is based on the same principles that helped Wallis Simpson make King Edward VIII fall so in love with her he gave up the throne, and led Brad Pitt to become infatuated with Angelina Jolie while they were filming Mr and Mrs Smith. Scroll down for video . Blake Lavak, pictured on This Morning, claims he can help any woman to 'stand out from the crowd' Blake says: 'It is remarkable how easy it is to land a great guy just by using the right technique. And yet, so many otherwise capable women struggle in this department. So the question has to be asked, what are they doing wrong, and what should they be doing instead.' He believes Angelina's stunning looks have got nothing to do with how she managed to bag Hollywood's hottest man - instead he says it's about 'standing out from the crowd' and 'taking control and keeping it.' He writes: 'She doesn't have to have movie-star looks, or a flat stomach, whitened teeth or bee-stung lips. In fact, none of that matters at all, as long as a few simple guidelines are followed instead. Blake, pictured with This Morning's Denise Robertson, who disagreed with his dating advice . 'Hard to believe? Of course it is... it is precisely because so few women really know how to land a big tuna that they end up with little sardines instead.' Blake writes about his techniques in his book, Own that Guy in 60 Days: A Practical Guide to Love for the 21st Century Woman, published by Durham Press. 'The book is 'a result of seven years of research into the world of the single women, and it identifies what the successful women do right to ensure that they walk off down the aisle with a big tuna.' Blake says his principles are based on those that helped Wallis Simpson make King Edward VIII, left, fall so in love with her he gave up the throne and led Brad Pitt to become infatuated with Angelina Jolie . Blake, who studied Psychology at The London School of Economics, found his formula for 'owning' a man after he found himself on the dating scene again following the end of his 15-year marriage. His quest to find a soul mate led him to discover what he thinks women are doing wrong when it comes to finding Mr Right. Blake's book is based on his own experiences . He explained as he appeared on today's This Morning: 'When I started internet dating, I started working out certain patterns. Some of the women were effective internet daters, others were ineffective.' He added that his sister also influenced his research after she struggled to find The One. He said: 'My sister is attractive, there is nothing wrong with her but she was struggling to have a relationship and she didn't know why. 'She came to me and said, ""can you help me out - this is what I do, I was taught in college to be cool and aloof, to stand back and let the guy chase you.""' But Blake said women actually need to do the opposite of this. He said they need to chase a man and controversially, sleep with him on the first date. He explained: 'Times have changed, sexual liberation has occurred. 'Women need to play it hot from day one. While everyone else is backing off and waiting to be called, you need to be proactive.' He added of the successful daters he has met: 'They don't wait around. They will talk to a guy at a party and take charge and not wait for a guy to speak to them.' He added if women want a man to fall in love with them within 60 days, they need to 'focus all their attention on him' and make him 'fall in love with the way you make him feel'. Another tip he has is to text or call a guy straight away to thank him if he has taken you out for dinner rather than waiting for him to contact you. Be pro-active: Put yourself out there, don't wait for a man to invite you out or talk to you. Chat them up or ask them out first. Buy them dinner: Show you are in control. Don't wait for him to call: Get in contact with him after a date to say thanks. Don't leave it for days waiting for him to call. Sleep with him on the first date: Give him what he wants and he'll be hooked. Even better, on the date, you should have paid for his drinks and dinner and 'put him on a pedestal'. This Morning's resident relationship expert Denise Robertson disagreed with Blake's advice. She said women shouldn't make it 'all about the man' and put all his needs first and she was shocked that Blake was recommending women jump straight into bed with a man. She said a healthy relationship isn't about a woman 'controlling' a man and treating him like he's stupid. Rather, she said a couple will fall in love if they are compatible and honest with one another. But Blake said women do need to play games in order to be successful - 'that's why it's called the mating game,' he said.","Blake Lavak, 53, has written Own That Guy In 60 Days .

"One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that ‘short’ fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind. But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today. Researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life. They say that complex life could have gained a foothold in hydrothermal vents (stock image shown) in the early Earth, billions of years ago . The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began. In October 2014 researchers from UC Santa Barbara found an unusual glimpse of the beginning of Earth deep in a Samoan volcano. Known as hotspots, volcanic island chains such as Samoa can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years. Researchers now say they have found unique chemical signatures that show them what conditions were like. The geochemists said they found evidence of Earth's early formation still trapped inside the volcanic hotspots. One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form. Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn’t have been possible in most conditions on Earth. But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun now describe a setting which provides the necessary conditions. They showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA. The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks - from volcanic activity (stock image shown) - may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began . No one is quite sure how complex genetic material came to be. In theory, 'short' strands of RNA (illustrated) should have thrived in the early Earth - at the expense of longer strands. This new theory, though, provides a possible explanation for how we ultimately evolved on the planet . To do this they used tiny glass capillary tubes to simulate the pores found in rocks. Heating the tubes showed that longer strands of RNA became trapped in the pore. ‘The key requirement is that the heat source be localised on one side of the elongated pore, so that the water on that side is significantly warmer than that on the other,’ said Dr Braun. Biomolecules that were washed into the pore could then be trapped, and concentrated, by the high temperature - forming longer polymers. This was important for the evolution of RNA and DNA, as it enabled more genetic information to be stored in longer molecules. Thus, the LMU group has succeeded in constructing a system which permits autonomous and continuous Darwinian evolution of ever more complex biomolecules - defining realistic conditions under which life could in principle have evolved. 'Life is fundamentally a thermodynamic non-equilibrium phenomenon. That is why the emergence of the first life-forms requires a local imbalance driven by an external energy source - for example, by a temperature difference imposed from outside the system,' Dr Braun explained. 'That this can be achieved in such a simple and elegant way was surprising even to us. The success of the project is a tribute to the close cooperation between all members of the team.'","Researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life .

"A Saudi Arabian air force sergeant has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for kidnapping and brutally sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy at a Las Vegas Strip hotel two years ago. Mazen Alotaibi, 25 will carry out his sentence at Nevada state prison after a judge spared him additional time for lewdness, kidnapping and other convictions during sentencing on Wednesday. But the Saudi's horrific assault on the teenager - which included forced oral and anal sex - left the victim's mother sobbing loudly in court as she told the judge her son's life had been 'ruined.' Crime: Saudi Arabian air force sergeant Mazen Alotaibi appears in court Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2015, in Las Vegas where he was sentenced to 35 years in Nevada state prison . Sentencing: The Saudi appeared in court with attorney Dominic Gentile, left,  and was found guilty of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy at a Las Vegas Strip hotel . Crime scene: Police said Alotaibi was staying at Circus Circus hotel on the Strip while on holiday when he sexually assaulted the teenager inside his sixth-floor room . A jury found Alotaibi guilty in October 2013 of having sex with the boy at the Circus-Circus hotel after a night of drinking cognac at a strip club on New Year's Eve 2012. His lawyer argued that the boy consented to sex for marijuana, and Alotaibi was too intoxicated to know he was committing a crime. But under Nevada state law, a child under the age of 16 cannot give sexual consent. The boy, who is now aged 15, testified that he was waiting to go to breakfast with a friend when he approached Alotaibi and other men early on December 31 at the Circus Circus hotel. He said he had smelled marijuana on their clothes and wanted some too. However, the jury heard that the other men who were lounging and smoking in the room shooed the boy away after learning that he was 13. Guilty: A jury found Alotaibi guilty in October 2013 of having sex with the boy at the Circus-Circus hotel after a night of drinking cognac at a strip club on New Year's Eve 2012 . But Alotaibi followed the boy, out of the room, smoked marijuana with him outside the hotel, and asked the boy for sex, according to the boy's account. Alotaibi was later seen on elevator surveillance video leaning down and apparently kissing the boy's neck on their way back to the hotel room. The boy is seen running back to the elevator about 30 minutes later. The boy testified that in the hotel room bathroom, Alotaibi blocked the door, offered him $150 and then doubled the amount, and forced him into oral and anal sex. A man who was traveling with Alotaibi testified that he knocked several times on the locked bathroom door while Alotaibi and the boy were inside, but they didn't come out. Mute: Mazen Alotaibi (right), seen here with his interpreter at an earlier hearing, admitted raping the boy when he refused to have sex with him . It was alleged that Alotaibi wanted sex and wouldn't take no for an answer. The boy testified that he was 'freaked out' and didn't know how to escape when Alotaibi made sexual advances toward him before raping him. 'It felt like I was trapped in a corner,' the boy said about the encounter at Circus Circus, his voice growing quiet. 'I was freaked out and I wanted to leave, but I didn't know what to do.' Police said that Alotaibi first denied the allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to . have sex with him for money. He told investigators . that he had made the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of . seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him. The boy has not been publicly named because of his age and the nature of the case. Alotaibi was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio,Texas, and had an identification card from the Saudi Arabian military. Saudi Arabia operates under Sharia, or Islamic law, and punishes homosexuality, or sodomy, with sentences of corporal and capital punishment. Saudi law also bans the consumption of alcohol. Those found guilty of drinking liquor could face anything from several weeks to several months in jail.","Mazen Alotaibi, 25, will carry out his sentence at Nevada state prison .

"A former fellow inmate of Australian serial killer Peter Dupas has told an inquest that the convicted killer had spoken of murdering a 95-year-old Melbourne woman, whose brutal death remains unsolved. Police allege Dupas fatally stabbed Kathleen Downes, a mother-of-three who was found in her bed at a Brunswick nursing home in Victoria with her throat cut and multiple stab wounds in December 1997. Sergeant David Dimsey told a Victorian Coroners Court inquest into Ms Downes' death that there were clear links between her murder and Dupas' other killings, such as the choice of weapon, The Hearald Sun reports. Victorian serial killer Peter Dupas (pictured centre in 2004) has been accused of killing 95-year-old Kathleen Downes . Ms Downes, a mother-of-three, was found in her bed at a Brunswick nursing home in Victoria with her throat cut and multiple stab wounds in December 1997 . He added that Dupas' motivation for killing the 95-year-old was likely to be her close appearance to his own mother, whom he was known to have disliked. Dupas was revealed to have called his alleged victim’s nursing home under a false name in the month leading up to her death, claiming to be inquiring about a place for his mother. Andrew Fraser, a former lawyer and convicted drug trafficker, told the inquest that Dupas spoke of the murder of the 'old sheila' while they were imprisoned together. Mr Fraser said that Dupas once told him, 'I reckon I'm going to end up wearing the old sheila Downes too.' Police allege that Dupas' motivation for killing the 95-year-old was likely to be her close appearance to his own mother . Andrew Fraser, a former lawyer and convicted drug trafficker, told the inquest that the serial killer had spoken of the murder of the 'old sheila' while they were imprisoned together . He claims Dupas mentioned Ms Downes on two other occasions, saying that he left no forensic evidence at the murder scene of the 'old sheila down the road'. Dupas' barrister, John Desmond, accused Mr Fraser of lying, saying he was motivated by an early release from prison and a reward. Dupas is serving life without parole after he was convicted of killing Mersina Halvagis in Fawkner Cemetery in 1997 and of the mutilation murders of Margaret Maher in October 1997 and Nicole Patterson in April 1999. Mr Fraser also gave a crucial testimony that Dupas made incriminating statements to him over Ms Halvagis's stabbing death, while the pair were jail mates at Port Phillip Prison. Dupas is serving life without parole after he was convicted of killing Mersina Halvagis (whose relatives are pictured in 2005) in Fawkner Cemetery in 1997 and of the mutilation murders of Margaret Maher in October 1997 and Nicole Patterson in April 1999 . The serial killer was not present during the proceedings, but watched the event over video link from prison. He will be called to present evidence on Thursday, however it is expected that he will refuse to comment in similar fashion to previous interviews regarding Ms Dowes death, according to the Herald Sun. Police believe he may be responsible for at least three other unsolved murder mysteries. The inquest continues.

"The Israeli military says two soldiers have been killed and a further seven wounded in a Hezbollah 'revenge attack' on a military convoy near the Lebanese border today. Israel's military responded to the anti-tank missile strike on the convoy with aerial and ground attacks on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. The Hezbollah group struck the nine-vehicle convoy with several missiles in an apparent retaliation for a deadly Israeli airstrike in Syria that killed six Hezbollah fighters earlier this month. A Spanish U.N. peacekeeper was also killed in today's clash. Israeli soldiers carry their injured comrade after his army vehicle was hit by anti-tank missile, near the Har Dov area, on the Israeli-Lebanese border today. The Lebanese Hezbollah group has claimed responsibility . Israeli military vehicles burn in Shebaa farms, an occupied area along the Israeli-Lebanese border near Ghajar village,  following a Hezbollah missile attack whick killed two Israeli soldiers and injured seven soldiers . Israel, which initially reported unspecified casualties on the Israeli side, responded by firing at least 50 artillery shells into Lebanon in a significant escalation along the volatile border today. The violence was the deadliest Hezbollah attack on Israel since a 2006 war between the two sides. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said there were Israeli casualties in the attack, but did not elaborate. Tensions in the region, where the frontiers of Israel, Lebanon and Syria meet and militant groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are active, have been bubbling for months but have boiled over in the past 10 days. There were initial reports on Lebanese media that an Israeli soldier was captured during the attack, but the Israeli army denied it, as did a Lebanese political source. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would respond 'forcefully.' In a statement, Hezbollah said its fighters destroyed a number of Israeli vehicles that were carrying Israeli officers and soldiers and caused casualties among 'enemy ranks.' Israeli soldiers lift their wounded comrades out of a military vehicle in order to administer first aid . Wounded Israeli soldiers receive medical treatment after their army vehicle was hit by anti-tank missile . Israeli military vehicles burn following today's attack, which Hezbollah claimed responsibility for . It said the attack was carried out by a group calling itself the 'heroic martyrs of Quneitra' - suggesting it was in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on the Golan Heights on January 18 that killed six Hezbollah fighters and an Iranian general. Hezbollah member Mohammad Issa was killed in the airstrike. He was the highest-ranking among the group, and was among the senior cadres who headed the group's operations in Syria. The Israeli military said an anti-tank missile hit an Israeli military vehicle near the Israeli-Lebanese border today, and  residents of the area had been ordered to remain in their homes. An hour later, mortars were fired at several Israeli military locations on Mount Dov and Mount Hermon, the Israeli military said. No injuries were reported in that attack. The military said it responded with fire toward Lebanese positions, and evacuated Israeli visitors from a ski resort in the area. The flare-up recalled the beginning of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, which was sparked by a Hezbollah attack on an Israeli military vehicle along the border and the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military said there was no indication that any Israeli soldiers captured in the attack.

Smoke rises after an explosion in the Lebanese village of Ghajar on the Israeli-Lebanese border today after Israel fired around 50 shells in retaliation to an attack on a Israeli military convoy . But the latest salvos raised the possibility of renewed fighting along the Lebanese-Israel border, which has remained mostly quiet since a month-long war in the summer of 2006. Since then, Israel has responded with airstrikes and artillery fire following a number of rocket attacks and shootings but the violence remained contained. Today's attack took place near Mount Dov and Shebaa Farms, a disputed tract of land where the borders of Israel, Lebanon and Syria meet. Hanna Bikel, a spokeswoman for Ziv Hospital in Safed, said four to six people with light wounds from the strike were on their way to the hospital. She declined to say whether they were soldiers or civilians. Two Lebanese officials said the Israeli shelling targeted the border villages of Majidiyeh, Abbasiyeh and Kfar Chouba near the Shebaa Farms area. Two sources told AFP that more than a dozen shells had been fired on Lebanese border villages and that Israeli warplanes were flying over the area. There was no immediate information on casualties. 'At least 15 shells have been fired against five villages in the south,' one security source said, adding that Majidiyeh village was hardest hit. Another security source said the Israeli army was firing a shell into the area about every two minutes, and was using artillery as well as tanks. Images broadcast from the scene on Israeli television showed large plumes of white smoke billowing across the area. Police have sealed off several roads close to the border in northern Israel. U.N. spokesman Andrea Tenenti said a peacekeeper was killed in circumstances the U.N. was still investigating. The Spanish Defense Ministry identified the dead peacekeeper as Corporal Francisco Javier Soria Toledo, 36. The Israeli military said it was responding to the incident with aerial and ground strikes on Hezbollah positions . An Israeli tanks stands ready right on the border with Lebanon in northern Israel today . Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters he received a phone call from Israel's ambassador to Spain, offering condolences. In a statement, Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that he conveyed Israel's condolences for the death in a conversation with his Spanish counterpart. The UN peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL has been in south Lebanon since 1978. One of the Lebanese officials said the incident is believed to be a 'sophisticated Hezbollah operation' targeting Israeli vehicles along the border. Families living on the border of the villages fled further within, fearing they'd be hit, said the officials, who are based in south Lebanon. Celebratory gunfire echoed in Shiite-dominated areas of Beirut, while in some areas, nervous parents hurried to pick up their children from school and hunker home. Reports suggest in Gaza Palestinian militant groups praised Hezbollah. Prime Minister Netanyahu, speaking at an event in southern Israel, warned that Israel's enemies would face a fate similar to Hamas, the rulers of the Gaza Strip who fought a brutal 50-day war against Israel last summer. 'To anyone who is trying to challenge us on the northern border I suggest looking at what happened here, not far from the city of Sderot, in the Gaza Strip. 'Hamas was dealt its heaviest blow ever since its founding and the Israel Defense Forces is prepared to act forcefully in all areas,' he said.

"An ambitious £1.1m overhaul of London's transport infrastructure will see dozens of underground and bus stations converted into tourist attractions, luxury apartments and new homes. The ten-year project will see 50 sites owned by Transport for London turned into profit-generating businesses, as they become home to supermarkets, restaurants and even 'click and collect' depots for online retailers. The move, which will involve some 10million sq ft of land, will mean the organisation receives an regular income from its huge property portfolio, said to be one of the largest and most valuable in the capital. A £1.1m project due to be launched on Monday will see dozens of underground and bus stations, including land around Oxford Circus (pictured), potentially become home to tourist attractions and luxury apartments . The original Hyde Park Corner station (pictured), opened in 1906, is now used as a pizza restaurant. Some of the buildings used in the programme will be listed but could be reformed in a similar way . It will also help to reduce travel fares, while also improving transport for London's ever-increasing population, according to London Mayor Boris Johnson. The one-year tender process is due to start on Monday, when the organisation will appoint a small number of property development partners to begin work on the overall collection of sites, several of which are home to listed buildings. The project is part of wider programme to generate £3.4bn in non fare revenue - including property, advertising and sponsorship - for the organisation over the next ten years. TfL currently has a 5,700 acre property portfolio, including buildings and land attached to tube stations, railways and highways. Two-thirds of its property estate is located in zones 1 and 2. Although TfL is not publicly announcing which stations are among the 50 sites, the plan is said to only include tube stations which are currently in use, some bus stations and land above and around various underground stations. Planning for the renovation of South Kensington tube and Northwood station is already underway, while the land above Oxford Circus tube station, of which TfL owns the freehold, could also be part of the plan. The ten-year project will see 50 sites owned by Transport for London, possibly including South Kensington (pictured), turned into profit-generating businesses, such as supermarkets and 'click and collect' depots . TfL has some of the most iconic and valuable assets in London with the majority of its property portfolio in the heart of the city. Previously, TfL sold assets and properties it no longer needed. But it says it has recently decided to retain and invest in its number of sites to generate profit. It has already started using some of the stations in this way, with space under Clapham North Tube now used by herb farmers. It has also introduced a collection of pop-up shops at some stations, while Argos launched its first underground store at London's Cannon Street Tube station last year. The move, which will involve some 10million sq ft of land, possibly includer Northwood station in north west London (pictured), will mean the organisation receives an regular income from its huge property portfolio . Bond Street station is home to a vast shopping mall, while a property partnership was created last year for the Earl's Court development, which saw TfL merge its freehold of Earl's Court 1 and 2 with developers Capital and Counties. The original Hyde Park Corner station, one of the more stylish underground station buildings, is also now used as a pizza restaurant. There are also plans in place with supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco to provide a click and collect grocery service for commuters. Graeme Craig, TfL's Director of Commercial Development, said the move was essential to ensure the transport network could cope with the expected rise in the capital's population. He said: 'London's population is set to grow from 8.4m today to 10m by 2030, the equivalent of one full Tube train arriving every three days. The programme will include projects similar to that carry out at Bond Street station, now home to a vast shopping mall (pictured) 'To enable this, London needs more homes and office spaces and the transport network needs sustained, long-term investment. 'Forming joint venture partnerships with property development experts will enable us to generate long-term income that we can invest in improving our network, which carries over 30 million journeys every day.' He added: 'We will be launching a tender process in the coming weeks to identify the best organisations in the world that will help us to achieve this.' Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'TfL's role is to look to the future, ensuring that transport continues to support jobs, homes and economic growth across the capital and the UK. The ambitious plans to redevelop some of TfL's land and assets presents a fantastic opportunity to support this important work and ensure public land creates homes for Londoners.' To launch the tender, TfL has formed a new non-executive property advisory group, which will be headed by Francis Salway, former Chief Executive of Land Securities Group Plc.","Ten-year project will involve 50 tube stations, bus stations and buildings .

"Its quaint cottages, picturesque gardens and towering church spire have earned Painswick the title of ‘Queen of the Cotswolds’. So it’s perhaps of little surprise that residents of the quiet village reacted with fury when a racy lingerie shop opened on their high street. But in an unusual twist to the tale, it was revealed that the risqué boutique of underwear was part of the set for The Casual Vacancy, one of the BBC’s most anticipated dramas of 2015. Outraged residents in Painswick, in the Cotswolds complained about the sex-shop film set for the new BBC adaptation of JK Rowling's book, A Casual Vacancy, starring Keeley Hawes, right . Residents complained to the Parish Council unaware the 'store' was a film set for the adaptation . The drama is based on The Casual Vacancy, written by JK Rowling, pictured, published in 2012 . The cast of high-profile adaptation of JK Rowling’s bestselling book, have spoken of how the fake shop was branded a ‘disgrace’ but also how some sheepish residents came in to browse the aisles, only to be turned away by the film crew. And Miss Marple star Julia McKenzie, 73, said the three-part series could be the last time fans see her on screen for several months, revealing she has had to turn down work after breaking her knee. The 2012 novel from the Harry Potter author, 49, tells the story of the fictional village of Pagford. Its dark themes of drug addiction, sexual abuse and suicide saw it sell one million copies in its first three weeks. But it was the lingerie store of character Samantha Mollison, played by Keeley Hawes, that drew the ire of Painswick residents when their village became the backdrop for the book’s twisting tale. Speaking at a preview of the series, director Johnny Campbell revealed the locals’ anger at thinking a sex shop had opened in their quiet streets. Although, he also admitted the makeshift store did get some enquiring visitors. He said: ‘They did mistake it for the real thing and complained about it at the local parish council meeting, they said it was a disgrace. ‘But there were a couple of occasions when we were filming and an old lady, white hair and a stick, was walking past looking in the window. We said, “Please excuse....”, she said, “Oh no, I’ve got all that stuff.” ‘Someone came in, they thought there was a sale on so we found people looking round at some of the stuff, it was amusing.’ The adaptation which stars Keeley Hawes, left and Julia McKenzie, right, will be broadcast next month . Unlike the fictional Pagford, where drug addiction and murky local politics seem to be the norm, Painswick paints a very different picture. Built largely of stone from a local quarry, it is one of the best preserved villages in the Cotswolds and sits in an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one of 38 such areas across England and Wales. With a population of barely over 2,000 it is a quiet community but one that is full of history. Its parish church, which dates back nearly 1,000 years, gave refuge to the Roundheads during the English Civil War. There are reportedly 99 yew trees growing in the courtyard, with legend claiming the Devil refuses to let a one hundredth take root. But even the charms of Painswick do not seem to be enough to lure Miss Marple star Julia McKenzie, who plays Shirley Mollison in The Casual Vacancy, back to rural life. She quit the countryside for London some years ago and claimed at Monday’s screening to have no regrets at abandoning the small village lifestyle. She said: ‘I lived in the Cotswolds for about 14 years, I lived in Burford which was actually one of the areas where we filmed. I can tell you there’s a lot of politics in village life. ‘In my particular village for instance, there were some very wealthy people who wanted to buy a new notice board. The arguments about whether it should have a front of glass or on this side or over that side - they gave up because they didn’t want to buy it any more. They don’t have anything else to do but keep an eye on other people. It’s very political on villages.’ Her turn in the series may be the last time she graces screens for several months following breaking her knee at the end of last year. Speaking about the injury for the first time, she said: ‘I broke my knee cap, London streets are not paved with gold I’m afraid, they are pitfalls. I went straight over with an arm full of shopping in November. ‘I thought it would just get better, I thought it was just swollen and I’d be all right. But it wasn’t and I had actually fractured my knee cap. ‘For the last two months I’ve been in a leg brace with iron bits and good knows what, sitting with my foot up all the time. I can’t do with out my crutch at the moment, I’ve lost my confidence a bit. ‘I’m just about to start physio, I’m doing some gentle work now and then I’ll go into about three months of physio. I can’t bend it, it’s so sore. ‘I’ve had to turn down a couple of things which might have taken me into the year but it’s ok. Half the time I actually look for an excuse not to work these days.’ The first episode of The Casual Vacancy will broadcast on BBC1 on Sunday February 15 at 9pm. The drama was filmed over the summer in picturesque Northleach, pictured .","Residents in Painswick in the Cotswolds complained about the new shop .

"Kirsty Taylor sleeps under a Frozen bed spread in a room jam-packed with products from the Disney movie. She loves to dress up as Queen Elsa and has seen the film so many times she knows all the words. She sounds like every other five-year-old in the country. But Kirsty isn't a little girl - she's 21. She's spent £1,000 on her haul of goodies, which includes a £100 custom-made glittery blue dress just like the one worn by Queen Elsa. Scroll down for video . Frozen fan Kirsty Taylor appears on This Morning with her boyfriend Jake Martin, who she makes dress up as the Disney character Kristoff . She also has an outfit for her dog - named Elsa of course - and makes her boyfriend, Jake Martin, 20, dress up as the character Kristoff. The former drama student has even turned her love of the film into a career. Until recently, she worked as a sales rep for the Disney Store and has now set up her own business dressing up as Elsa to attend children's parties and schools. Explaining her obsession on today's This Morning, Kirsty, from Rotherham, said: 'I was obsessed from the trailers. I remember seeing the trailers and being desperate to go to the cinema to see it because I was so excited. Kirsty has spent £100 on a custom-made glittery blue dress just like the one worn by Queen Elsa in the film . 'When I first saw it, I loved the story, the music, the characters - especially Elsa. She's not your typical Disney princess, she wasn't going out to find her true love.' Kirsty admitted the film helped her through a difficult period in her life. 'At the time I was suffering from severe depression and locked away in my room. 'Elsa's character inspired me, she gave me hope. She was battling demons like I was battling my own. I know it's a film but I thought if she can do it, I can.' Kirsty said she can 'really relate' to the character because of the way she 'battles her demons' Not going to let him go: Kirsty said Jake is her Prince Charming . She added in an interview with The Sun that she can 'really relate' to Elsa - voiced by Idina Menzel in the animated film - who struggles to control a magical power that turns things into ice. Kirsty said: 'She is my ultimate role model. I don't know what I'd do without Frozen. It's taken over all aspects of my life.' When the film was first released in 2013, Kirsty was single and wanted to find a Prince Charming of her own. 'I needed my own Kristoff and then Jake came along,' she said. Jake joined her on today's This Morning and admitted that when Kirsty puts the film on (again): 'I try and keep myself otherwise occupied.' But he is willing to dress up as Kristoff in a £50 outfit she bought him - even though it means he gets 'stick from my mates'.

"Nearly 50 police commandos have been slaughtered in the Philippines by Muslim rebels who claim they entered their territory without agreeing to it first. An 11 hour gun-battle broke out after police entered the remote town of Mamasapano, held by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the early hours of Sunday without liaising with the rebels as required under a ceasefire agreement. Police say that the bodies of 49 officers have been removed from the town on Mindano island and moved to an army camp. Policeman carry the body of one of their comrades during a retrieval operation after nearly 50 officers were slaughtered . Commandos clashed with Muslim rebels and an 11 hour gun battle broke out in the remote town of Mamasapano in the Philippines . It is not known whether any MILF members were killed in the attack, which came as police had been targeting two high-profile terror suspects in the operation. Philippine national police chief Leonardo Espina and interior and local government secretary Manuel Roxas flew to Maguindanao today. In a statement Mr Espina said the police commandos were chasing a 'high-value target' believed to be behind recent bomb attacks in the south but he did not elaborate. Meanwhile the MILF's chief peace negotiator Mohagher Iqbal revealed authorities were trying to arrest a member of regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah called Zulkifli bin Hir, who is on the United States' most wanted list with a $5million bounty on his head. Malaysian bomb-maker Zulkifli is the most prominent of the 10 to 12 foreign JI members believed hiding in the Philippines. He went into hiding in the southern region in 2003 and has since been training local militants, according to the military. Authorities were also allegedly targeting Basit Usman, commander of the BIFF Philippine Muslim rebel faction that is not part of peace talks. An injured commando on a stretcher waits to be loaded on to a US military helicopter following the attack by MILF . The firefight in Mamasapano was only the second since the ceasefire when two soldiers and 18 Muslim gunmen were killed in a clash on the southern island of Basilan in April 2014 . The 10,000-member MILF had recently agreed to end decades of rebellion in the mainly Catholic nation in exchange for a proposed law now being debated in parliament that would give minority Muslims self-rule in several southern provinces. The rebels were scheduled to start disarming at the start of this year under the peace treaty. Mr Iqbal said: 'This is the first encounter between the MILF and (government forces) this year. Hopefully, this will be the last. 'We are committed (to the peace process). For the MILF, the ceasefire still holds.' The rebel group's vice chairman, Ghazali Jaafar, also said the peace treaty signed last March was the only solution to the conflict.

MILF's chief peace negotiator Mohagher Iqbal, pictured, revealed authorities were trying to arrest a member of regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah . The Muslim rebellion in Mindanao had claimed tens of thousands of lives over several decades.

Intense footage of the encounter shows Stout throwing himself into the unidentified robber only to be shot then beaten with the gun for his attempt. Scroll down for video . Showdown: Customer CJ Stout saw the gunman and waited for an opportunity to tackle him and stop the robbery . The Tulsa World reports that the gunman remains at large. The encounter happened at approximately 8:45 p.m. on Jan. 21 when the gunman burst into the store with a hoodie and a mask covering his face. Security cameras captured him pointing a gun at the clerk, who slowly takes money out of the register. As the gunman reaches for the cash Stout rush him and tackles him. The gunman got a shot off into Stout's shoulder before the two tumbled to the ground and the robber began pistol whipping his head. The gunman then raced away before authorities could arrive. 'We’ve had no tips so far,' said Sgt. Mike Mahan. 'This is an obviously dangerous guy who definitely needs to be caught' He is described as being roughly 5 feet 8 inches tall and possibly in his teens. Fight for life: The robber continues to pistol whip the shot Stou before fleeing before authorities could arrive . Staggered and shot: Stout was lucky to be alive as police say if he had been shot inches left or right he would have died . 'If you look at it, just a foot to one way or the other and (Stout) could have been killed. It could have turned out very, very badly,' Mahan said. The bullet exited below his ribs on the left side and Stout was released from a hospital the following day. 'I didn’t really feel it when I got shot, I figure because of the adrenaline,' he said. 'The pain is still there — the bullet traveled pretty deep. I’ve seen before where people get shot after the fact, after the robbery, and I figured I didn’t know what was going to happen. I didn’t want to just sit there and wait.'","CJ Stout tackled the gunman who had come into the Muskogee, Okla., Stop N Go demanding money from the clerk .

"Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the case of suspected police killer Eric Frein (pictured) who went on the run, sparking a huge manhunt . Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the case of suspected police killer Eric Frein, who went on the run for 48 days after allegedly murdering a police officer and seriously injuring another. 'Cop killer' Frein, 31, has been charged with 12 offences, including first-degree murder, terrorism and the possession of weapons of mass destruction. Prosecutors had previously said they would seek the death penalty and on Tuesday they submitted the formal paperwork. He is accused of shooting two state troopers, killing Corporal Byron Dickson and injuring Trooper Alex T Douglass. The shootings sparked a seven-week manhunt in eastern Pennsylvania. In documents seen by MailOnline, prosecutors state: 'The Commonwealth is seeking the death penalty in connection with the death of Byron K. Dickson, II, upon conviction of the crime of Murder in the First Degree.' It adds: 'If the Defendant is convicted of First Degree Murder...the Commonwealth intends to present testimony concerning the victim and victim impact testimony during the sentencing phase from the employer, co-workers, friends and family of Byron K. Dickson, II.' Frein's arraignment is scheduled to take place tomorrow at 1pm in the Pike County Court of Common Pleas in Milford, Pennsylvania. It is expected his court appearance will be by video link with the Pike County Correctional Facility. CNN reported that Frein's lawyer said the move was 'expected'. Scroll down for video . Attorney Michael Weinstein said: 'There's a lot of work ahead, and there's just so much more to do. 'Right now, it's all just in the early stages, so once we get the evidence laid out we can go from there.' Corporal Bryon Dickson (left) was killed in the attack and Trooper Alex Douglass (right) was wounded . According to an affidavit filed in Pike County, Frein allegedly told investigators that he 'wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was insufficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for.' Police searched for him for 48 days and authorities scoured almost all of the Pocono Mountains during the manhunt. They eventually discovered him walking towards an abandoned airport hangar in the middle of a field in Tannersville, Pennsylvania. Frein  was arrested using the handcuffs of fallen State Trooper Cpl Dickson - the man Frein allegedly killed. Frein is pictured being escorted by police outside the Pike County Courthouse in Milford last November . Pennsylvania State Police SWAT officers stand by as Eric Frein arrives at the Pike County Courthouse . At the time of his arrest, Frein had made his way on to the FBI's Most Wanted list and an award of $100,000 was being offered for any information that led to his arrest. Frein managed to evade authorities for seven weeks thanks to his survivalist skills. Using dogs, thermal imaging technology and other tools, law enforcement officials combed miles of forest as they hunted for the suspect, who they called 'an experienced survivalist at home in the woods'. Trackers found items they believe Frein hidden or abandoned in the woods — including soiled diapers, empty packs of Serbian cigarettes, an AK-47-style assault rifle and ammunition, and two pipe bombs that were functional and capable of causing 'significant damage'. They also discovered a journal, allegedly kept by Frein and found in a bag of trash at a hastily abandoned campsite, that offered a chilling account of the ambush and his subsequent escape into the woods. The journal's author described Dickson as falling 'still and quiet' after being shot twice. An exterior view of the abandoned airplane hangar in the Birchwood Resort. Frein was caught nearby . Officials warned Frein was armed and extremely dangerous and closed schools and urged residents to be alert and cautious. At his funeral, Cpl Dickson was described as a 'devoted husband and father' and an 'impeccable' ex-Marine who took his work seriously, but who also enjoyed making wooden toys for his young sons and finding humor in everyday situations. Trooper Alex Douglass was shot in the pelvis and critically injured in the ambush, which took place during a late-night shift change at a local barracks. Frein has been charged with first-degree murder, murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder, possession of weapons of mass destruction, discharging a firearm into an occupied structure and reckless endangerment.

"A fisherman has caught a massive three-metre 200kg bull shark off a popular swimming beach on the coast of northern New South Wales. Joel Merchant, 33, caught the shark with his girlfriend Danielle Simpson, 35, on Australia Day off the coast of Duranbah, near Tweed Heads. Mr Merchant catches fish – including sharks - to sell to the  local Tweed Heads shop Scales Seafood. Scroll down for video . Joel Merchant, 33, caught a massive bull shark with his girlfriend Danielle Simpson (right), 35, on Australia Day . The three-metre 200kg bull shark was caught 2km off a popular swimming beach Duranbah in northern NSW . Mr Merchant caught the shark off a fixed fishing line anchored 2km from Duranbah. He said it was the first time Ms Simpson had come out on the boat with him to check the lines and she was stunned by their catch. 'She was amazed by it,' he told Daily Mail Australia. But he insisted the 200kg shark was easy to get on the boat – and wasn't anywhere near the biggest he's ever caught. 'It was pretty easy to pull on that one, it just behaved itself,' Mr Merchant said. 'I have no idea how many more I've caught but the biggest one a long time ago was around about four metres. Mr Merchant (left) said it was the first time Ms Simpson had come out on the boat with him to check the lines . Mr Merchant catches fish – including sharks - to sell to local Tweed Heads shop Scales Seafood . 'You can quite often see them about three-and-half metres.' Mr Merchant also stressed that he operated in a controlled fishery that was 'heavily policed'. 'There are so many rules, it's not just open slather,' he said. 'I only have five hooks in the water and I get enough to supply my local fish shop.' Since posting pictures of the shark online the couple has attracted a major backlash from people accusing them of being 'horrible' and 'murderers'. Mr Merchant caught the shark off a fixed fishing line anchored 2km from Duranbah (pictured) 'I target spanner crabs, snapper and other fish but I also like to put flake on the shelf for them,' Mr Merchant said. 'I fish, I pay my bills and I catch a few sharks… people want to eat flake and I supply it.' He said the angry commenters accusing him of killing near-extinct species were 'misinformed' about fishing laws and endangered species. 'People are saying ""You're killing wonderful creatures"", ""The ocean's not yours"", ""It's one step away from clubbing puppies"",' he said, . 'People are just misinformed and they don't understand just what's out there, they only say what's said in the media by so-called experts. He insisted the 200kg shark was easy to get on the boat – and wasn't anywhere near the biggest he's caught . 'NSW have a 500kg a week fishing limit - that's only a couple of sharks at the end of the day. 'We try to target the smaller sharks but we can't.' Mr Merchant said there were 'plenty' of bull sharks in the ocean. 'I'm out there doing it, I'm the only one on this east coast region fishing for sharks in the northern NSW rivers so I'm the only person out there seeing this for myself,' he said. 'Everyone else is just sitting back getting told about something that they don't know what they're talking about.' Since posting pictures of the shark online the couple has attracted a major backlash from people accusing them of being 'horrible' and 'murderers' Alexia Wellbelove, senior program manager at the Humane Society International, said bull sharks are not listed as a threatened species in NSW but said 'that doesn't mean that you shouldn't protect them'. 'It's our preference that sharks like that are kept alive rather than being caught and eaten as food,' Ms Wellbelove said. 'There are plenty of other fish in the sea that are better as food sources.' Ms Wellbelove added that protected shark species in NSW include great hammerheads, scalloped hammerheads, great whites and grey nurses – which are listed as critically endangered. 'To our mind we know there's lots of sharks out there and it's great to see they're being caught,' she said. 'But if a shark is accidentally caught then let's release it and leave it to carry on with its life.'","Joel Merchant caught a bull shark with his girlfriend Danielle Simpson .

"Autistic Melissa Jones, pictured, has been through 'hell' after police wrongly believed she was drunk . A teenage girl with autism was arrested and hauled before the courts because police mistakenly assumed she was drunk. Despite being completely sober, 17-year-old Melissa Jones spent ten hours in a police cell, was finger-printed and had her DNA taken. She was charged with being drunk and disorderly, forced to appear in court and became suicidal while waiting eight months for her case to go to trial. Last week, however, prosecutors finally realised they had got it wrong and agreed to drop the case against her. Her mother, Christine Evans, 49, a training manager, yesterday said her daughter, who also has learning difficulties, had been through ‘hell’. ‘Having this hanging over her for the past eight months has had a terrible effect on her,’ said divorcee Miss Evans. ‘She has a basic understanding of right and wrong, so to be arrested for something she didn’t do was devastating. ‘She has tried to commit suicide and is having weekly counselling. She hardly ever goes out any more.’ Miss Jones’s ordeal began shortly before midnight on June 16 last year when she and a friend went to a shop near her home in Edge Hill, Liverpool, to buy some Coca-Cola. Another customer, a drunken woman, became aggressive when the assistant refused to serve her, and attacked Miss Jones and her friend when they intervened. Both girls were stamped on and suffered severe bruising. When police arrived the attacker had fled, and Miss Jones was crying and hysterical. Despite her protestations, police assumed she had been drinking and arrested her. Miss Jones spent ten hours in a police cell, was finger-printed and had her DNA taken (file photo) Her mother ran to the shop and told officers that Melissa had autism, attention deficit disorder and communication difficulties. ‘But they didn’t want to know,’ she said. ‘Melissa hadn’t had a  drop of alcohol, but they said she was drunk. ‘At the police station, a doctor confirmed she hadn’t been drinking, but still the police tried to pursue her through the courts. ‘I’ve got a lot of time for the police and the work they do, but this time they really let Melissa down.’ The police offered Miss Jones a £60 fixed penalty but she refused to admit her guilt. Instead she was summonsed to appear . before court in November last year, where she was formally charged with . being drunk and disorderly. Miss . Jones, who is studying bakery at college, was due to face trial next . month but was told last week that the Crown Prosecution Service had . decided to drop the case. Her solicitor Mark Ellis, of James Murray Solicitors, said: ‘Melissa has been through a terrible ordeal. ‘She is a vulnerable young girl who should never have been arrested or put before the courts.’ A . spokesman for the CPS said: ‘After the first hearing in November 2012 . the CPS reviewed the case, including new information from the defence, . and decided that the available evidence was insufficient to prove that .

"The amazing mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position have been unearthed in Mongolia. A forensic examination is underway on the human relic which is believed to be around 200 years old, after being preserved in animal skin. 'The mummified body sits in a lotus position, as if still meditating,' said a report in The Siberian Times - citing Mongolian accounts of the discovery. The amazing mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position have been unearthed in Mongolia . 'Experts that only had time to carry basic visual test say they believe the body can be about 200 years old.' The body was found on 27 January in Songinokhairkhan province, said Mongolia's 'Morning Newspaper'. It was covered in 'cattle skin'. The human remains are now undergoing forensic examination in capital Ulaanbataar. Initial speculation is that the mummy could be a teacher of Lama Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov. Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov, born in 1852, was a Buryat Buddhist Lama of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, best known for the lifelike state of his body.

"A mortar attack on an election rally in support of President Bashar al-Assad has killed at least 20 people in Syria. The strike took place as pro-government Syrians gathered in a tent in the city of Deraa, 70 miles south of capital Damascus. At least 30 people were also injured. Assad himself was not present at the event. At least one child was among 11 civilians killed in the attack. Upcoming election: Syrian President Bashar Assad casts his ballot next to his wife Asma Assad at a polling station during a referendum on the new constitution in 2012. He was not present when today's attack killed at least 20 of his supporters . With Syria's presidential election just a fortnight away, today's attack will reinforce fears that rebels would mark it with a campaign of bombings across the country. In nearby Damascus, the government has launched its 'Together, We Rebuild' campaign that now peppers the capital's streets with posters that feature hands clasped together. Assad is widely expected to win a third, seven-year mandate at the June 3 presidential election. Some residents of the capital anticipate more destruction and say talk of rebuilding is premature. Daily, they hear blasts of government bombardment onto rebellious suburbs and the booms of warplanes in the sky on bombing runs. Government heartland: The attack took place as pro-government Syrians gathered in a tent in the city of Deraa, 70 miles south of capital Damascus . Broken siege: Syria's army broke a siege of Aleppo prison, cutting off a major rebel supply route in the northern city . Warm welcome: Prisoners hold the Syrian flag as pro-government soldiers entered the building . To retaliate, rebels use mortars and car bombs to hit the centre of the capital, an area a few miles wide that is firmly in government hands. Earlier this month, 27 mortar and rocket attacks hit on a single day and Damascenes fear rebels will rain hell on the capital on election day to protest the event. A new fear is that rebels are digging tunnels into Damascus, either to smuggle themselves and weapons into the heart of Assad's stronghold or to pack explosives under the capital. Such 'tunnel bombs' are a tactic rebels have started using in recent months on military targets in the north, including a hotel used by soldiers in Aleppo and a base in Idlib province. Fighters dig tunnels hundreds of meters long to plant explosives that obliterate an entire area. Tunnel bombs have not yet been used in Damascus, but residents fear they could reduce a whole neighborhood of tower blocks to rubble and kill hundreds. Supply line: A military statement said the fighting around the prison, about 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Aleppo, had cut a supply line linking the rebel-dominated rural hinterland with the contested city . Hard fighting: The military command was determined to 'hit the terrorist groups with an iron fist and restore security and stability to Aleppo city and every inch of the country' as rebel fighters (pictured) continue to fight back . It comes as Assad's troops broke a year-long rebel siege of Aleppo's main prison yesterday, cutting a main insurgent supply line and vowing to press on and recapture the whole of Syria's biggest city. State television showed soldiers inside the prison after they routed al Qaeda and other Islamist forces who had tried several times in recent months to break into the jail and free thousands of prisoners. A military statement said the fighting around the prison, about 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Aleppo, had cut a supply line linking the rebel-dominated rural hinterland with the contested city. 'It represents a heavy blow to these groups that were using the countryside as a base to target Aleppo and its population,' the statement said. The military command was determined to 'hit the terrorist groups with an iron fist and restore security and stability to Aleppo city and every inch of the country.'","The attack happened as Assad supporters gathered in a tent in Deraa .

"Ed Miliband on the steps of 10 Downing Street, with his arm around Alex Salmond, alongside a grinning Gerry Adams. That is the ‘nightmare’ image conjured up in a Tory attack advert released yesterday. Mr Miliband, often mocked by satirists as looking like a character from the popular animated series Wallace and Gromit, seems to have had his features enhanced highlighting the resemblance. It was published after it emerged Labour ministers have been cosying up to the Irish Republican party Sinn Fein in an effort to convince them to join a potential future coalition. Scroll down for video . Vicious: The Conservative poster appears to distort Ed Miliband's features (left). It also shows him embracing Alec Salmond and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams (right) Pat Doherty, the Sinn Fein MP for West Tyrone, told Channel 4 News he is ‘regularly badgered’ by shadow cabinet members about whether they would join a a coalition government led by Labour if it did not win enough seats to pass laws in the House of Commons. ‘They bring it up quite bluntly and it’s always dealt with in the same way,’ he said. David Cameron brought up the issued at Prime Ministers’ Questions yesterday, saying: ‘We have seen Labour casting around for a coalition with the SNP and a coalition with Sinn Fein - the first time Britain would have people who want to break up Britain and bankrupt Britain. What a useless shower.’ Tory MP Ben Wallace, who served in Northern Ireland with the Scots Guards, said: ‘So desperate is Ed Miliband to get the keys to No 10, he would do a deal with the people who tried to blow it up.’ The poster carries the headline: ‘Your worst nightmare…just got even worse’ over two pictures, one of a grinning Ed Miliband in Downing Street, a second with him alongside former SNP leader Mr Salmond and Mr Adams. Underneath the poster states: ‘The SNP and Sinn Fein propping up Ed Miliband? Chaos For Britain’ Labour reacted furiously to the claims. Furious: A senior Labour source denied Ed Miliband's (pictured) party was ‘cosying up’ to Sinn Fein . A senior Labour source denied the party was ‘cosying up’ to Sinn Fein, but refused to rule out a future coalition. Asked about the prospect of a coalition, the source said: ‘We are working towards a majority Labour government.’ He also denied that Ed Miliband ‘held any form of coalition talks’ during a recent visit to Northern Ireland. ‘The implication was that Ed was cosying up to Sinn Fein. That is not true.’ Senior Tory source said there was ‘zero prospect’ of a Tory deal with Sinn Fein or the SNP. Currently Sinn Fein MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commons because they do not want to swear the oath of allegiance to the Queen. In a statement last night, a spokesman said: ‘Sinn Féin’s position on Westminster is very well known. We do not take our seats.’","'Nightmare' poster features Ed Miliband, Alex Salmond and Gerry Adams .

"It was always one of the most unconventional relationships in showbusiness – and now, after 13 years, it has come to an end. Helena Bonham Carter, the Merchant Ivory English rose, has split from her partner, the eccentric American film director Tim Burton, best known for writing and directing romantic fantasy film Edward Scissorhands. A spokesman for the couple tells me: ‘Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children. We would ask that you respect their privacy and that of their children during this time.’ Scroll down for video . Helena Bonham Carter has split from her partner, Tim Burton. The revelation comes after a slightly dishevelled Bonham Carter was seen leaving a party last week (right) without her husband . Struggling: Bonham Carter appeared to be a touch worse for wear in the early hours of Friday . The revelation comes after a slightly dishevelled Bonham Carter was seen leaving a party last week without her husband. There were signs their relationship was in trouble last year, when Burton, 56, was pictured embracing a mystery blonde, thought to be one of his assistants, near his home in Hampstead. At the time the couple refused to comment. Recently, though, the stress has clearly proved too much to bear, as evidenced by Helena’s appearance last week. But it is not the first time concern has been raised about her wellbeing. A strange situation?: In September 2013 Tim was allegedly caught with a blonde lady after a dinner date in London; Carter later said the report was 'nonsense' ‘Helena was very upset at the Chequers party earlier this month hosted by Samantha Cameron,’ says a friend. ‘Other guests noticed she was in a bad way. She is really upset. It’s all still very raw and they only told the children two weeks ago.’ Another friend says: ‘Tim is having a classic mid-life crisis. All Helena’s friends think he’s a terrible old cliche. Helena gave him a lot of time to sort himself out.’ The self-confessed ‘bonkers couple’ famously do not share a home, instead living next door to each other in north London with their children, Billy Ray, ten, and Nell, six. ‘The houses are joined,’ Bonham Carter has explained. ‘He always visits, which is really touching. He’s always coming over. We have a throughway. Journalists think there’s an underground tunnel, gothic. It’s actually quite above ground, lots of light.’ She admitted, however, they only share a bed ‘sometimes’ because of ‘a snoring issue’. ‘I talk, he snores. The other thing is, he’s an insomniac, so he needs to watch television to get to sleep. I need silence.’ The couple have collaborated on more than seven films since they met on the set of 2001’s Planet of the Apes, which Burton directed. ‘You were the first person I thought of to play a chimpanzee,’ he told her at the time. Often described as his ‘muse’, Bonham Carter, 48, went on to star in his films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows. In that time she morphed from a self-described ‘corset bimbo’ into playing darker roles. She is currently reprising her role as the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass, which Burton is producing. Once she got together with the scruffy Burton her public image was transformed and she became increasingly renowned for her bizarre dress sense. ‘I feel like I have a reputation to keep,’ Bonham Carter once said of her outlandish outfits. ‘I have a responsibility now to dress badly – so it’s kind of liberating.’ Working with her partner, however, took its toll. ‘It’s not without its pressures, working with Tim,’ she said in 2010 following their work on the first Alice in Wonderland film, which Burton also directed. It's over: Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton, pictured in February 2013, have split after 13 years together, her rep confirmed to People on Tuesday . Last time they were seen together: Carter photobombed Burton when he was posing with Nicole Scherzinger backstage at Cats on Saturday . ‘It worked on Alice. Sweeney was very stressful, very hard on our relationship. He’s a partner in our private life, but when he’s directing, he’s the boss. And maybe I confuse that.’ In 2005 Bonham Carter, great-granddaughter of Liberal prime minister Herbert Asquith, also described the director as being on the autistic spectrum. ‘Tim will kill me, but while making this drama I realised he has a bit of Asperger’s in him, you start recognising the signs. We were watching a documentary about autism and he said that was how he felt as a child.’ With their children: Together the former power couple have an 11-year-old son Billy and daughter Nell, aged seven; here they are all pictured in November at London's Winter Wonderland . Cutting a lonely figure: The critically acclaimed actress in bulky attire on Friday in London when she was Christmas shopping . Happier days: The twosome - he's 56 and she's 48 - embracing in 2010 at the British Academy Television Awards in London . It is perhaps telling that Burton has just released his first directorial live-action feature in 13 years that doesn’t star the actress. Big Eyes, which is out this week, instead has Amy Adams in the lead role. Burton was previously married to German-born artist Lena Gieseke for four years although the couple separated in 1991 when he moved in with model and actress Lisa Marie Smith. Before Burton, Bonham Carter embarked on a relationship with Sir Kenneth Branagh while he was still married to Emma Thompson after co-starring with him in 1994 film Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. The couple separated in 1999. They were professionally reunited earlier this year after he directed her in the Disney film Cinderella, in which she plays the fairy godmother. In the early hours of Friday morning Bonham Carter was seen leaving PR man Matthew Freud’s Christmas Party – apparently a little worse for wear – alongside Angus Deayton and his wife. However, she and Burton spent Saturday together, attending a production of Cats in the West End. The Sunday Times Rich List last year claimed the couple had a combined wealth of £80million . More of a collaborative one for Tim: In 2005's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, the British beauty worked with Noah Taylor,   Freddie Highmore and David Kelly . She gave it her all: The critically acclaimed actress dove into her role for the 2007 film Sweeney Todd; later Burton would say this film was hard on their relationship . A scar look for her: Carter as The Queen of Hearts in Burton's Alice In Wonderland in 2010 . Another gem: In 2012 Helena co-starred with Bella Heathcote in Tim's drama Dark Shadows .","The couple have been together for 13 years but lived in separate houses .

"Cats kill millions of birds each year but this little kitty can't get a claw in edgeways as he's accosted by a gaggle of excitable ducklings.

"Well-known daredevil, Yevgeny 'Wizard' Ivanov, has just performed one of his most extreme stunts to date. The adrenaline junkie jumped off of a 62-metre (203 feet) high cliff, on Mounta Alimov in Crimea, but this time he had attached the rope to his body through his skin. By piercing the skin around his spine with black hooks, Ivanov was able to hold his bungee rope in place during the jump. A well-known daredevil attempted a 62-metre bungee jump in Crimea - but there was a major twist! Instead of fastening the cord around his waist, Yevgney Ivanov attached it directly to his skin via hooks . As extreme as the jump may be, Ivanov is not the first to attempt such a stunt. In fact, more than 200 of such jumps have been made across the world, according to the man. However, his recent jump is allegedly the highest ever completed. Ivanov pierced the skin around his spine to insert black hooks, which supported his weight as he flew . Ivanov is not the first man to attempt such a stunt - in fact, he claims there have been over 200 just like it .

"A protective pit bull named Mamma is being hailed a 'hero' for saving an Ohio family from being burgled. Tony Byrd, Jr, 32, from Port Clinton heard his 11-year-old canine growling suspiciously just before 11pm on Sunday and went to check the front door. When he got to the entrance way, he caught sight of someone running off and yelling as they left a trail of blood behind in the snow. Pup to the rescue: Tony Byrd, Jr, 32, from Port Clinton heard his 11-year-old canine, Mamma, growling suspiciously just before 11pm on Sunday and went to check the front door - the pet saved him from burglary . The unidentified individual reportedly ran to a dark car parked out the front of Byrd's home and fled the scene after being attacked by Mamma. Commenting on his trusty pet, Byrd told The Blade: 'She met him right there at the door. She did her job.' Along with being a security guard, Mamma works as a service dog for Mr Byrd's 11-year-old daughter, Zahara, who has cerebral palsy. The youngster was apparently upstairs sleeping when the attempted break-in took place. She was joined by the daughter of one of Byrd's friends. He says Mamma is normally 'sweet' and 'playful' so she must have sensed something bad about the person at the door. Police are asking hospitals in the Port Clinton area to watch for anyone seeking treatment for dog bites to the arms and hands. The gender of the suspect is unknown.","Tony Byrd, Jr, 32, from Port Clinton heard his 11-year-old canine growling suspiciously just before 11pm on Sunday and went to check the front door .

"One out of every five children rely on food stamps to stay fed, according to numbers released by the Census Bureau on Wednesday. The agency released statistics on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as food stamps, showing 16million children relied on SNAP in 2014, the most since 2008. The program saw a sharp increase in registration at the outset of the recession—the 2007 Census found 7million children on the program—and has hovered at higher levels ever since. Food assistance: The Census Bureau released statistics Wednesday showing that one in five children relied on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, commonly known as food stamps, in 2014 . The data shows that 8million children, half of those receiving SNAP benefits, lived with only their mother, while 5million lived with married parents. Though the numbers are currently still high, participation and spending in the program appear to be declining, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The agency announced this week that $76billion was spent on SNAP in 2014, down 8 percent from the previous year. Though SNAP has been a target of conservatives—concentrated cuts in 2014 trimmed $8.6billion over 10 years—more scrutiny is expected in the Republican-controlled Congress. The new chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Mike Conaway, told Politico he's already planning to review food stamps for the 2019 Farm Bill, the omnibus spending bill that covers food assistance along with various agriculture programs. 'We ought to do a soup-to-nuts review of the entire program,' he said in November. 'What works? What doesn’t work? Are there moral hazards baked into the system?' Need: Though Republican lawmakers like Representative Mike Conaway say they are looking to review and overhaul the program, supporters say levels of fraud and waste are low . Spending: The Congressional Budget Office announced this week that spending was down 8 percent in the program compared to 2013 . In spite of high levels of spending on the program, progressive think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that few benefits go to those who don't need it. 'Fewer than 1 percent of SNAP benefits are issued to households that do not meet all of the program’s eligibility requirements,' the organization states in a policy report. Food stamps spending cuts came about as a compromise between House Republicans and Senate Democrats in the 2014 Farm Bill, which also cut around $19billion in direct payments to farmers. A significant amount of spending cuts, however, were offset by increases to government subsidies that covered deductibles farmers pay for crop insurance, according to the Washington Post.","The agency announced Wednesday that 16million children relied on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits .

"Two marksmen fired 22 rounds in a 'crazy', frenetic and adrenaline-filled moment as police stormed the Lindt Cafe and shot gunman Man Haron Monis to end the Sydney siege. Entry officers initially felt a sense of pride after a hail of gunfire and stun grenades in the early hours of December 16 brought the Martin Place stand-off to a tense climax. But the role of the two key, unnamed marksmen who led the operation has been called into question as details emerged at an inquest on Thursday that fragments of ricocheted police bullets struck and killed mother-of-three Katrina Dawson. The findings were announced at Glebe Coroner's Court in Sydney's inner-west, and revealed that the 38-year-old barrister died from blood loss after the deflected police rounds struck her carotid artery. Monis was shot 13 times, twice in the head, while it also emerged that he forced cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34, to kneel before he shot him execution-style in the back of the head. Super adrenalin, crazy moments and fear: What the entry team marksmen felt when they were tasked with the job of storming the Lindt cafe to take down gunman Man Haron Monis . Recriminations: Even before the inquest into the deaths of 38-year-old Sydney barrister Katrina Dawson (left) and  Tori Johnson (right)began, there has been many questions over the role of police and whether they could have saved the two victims lives if they had acted differently . Heart stopping moment: A former special operations officer says at the moment when the marksmen stormed the Lindt Cafe 'every single one of the entry team that went into that cafe faced the possibility that this would be the last job of their life, Monis could have blown the place to smithereens . To be known at the inquest into the Sydney siege just as 'Officer A' and 'Officer B', the two leading shooters tasked with bringing down the crazed Monis have been granted protection of their identity - for now. Daily Mail Australia has learned their 'proud' work in striking Monis twice in the head and killing him, and then shooting a further 20 rounds from semi automatic rifles into the 'crazy' scene of the siege's end has drawn criticism from law enforcement officers and others. And now the counsel assisting the inquest into the siege, Jeremy Gormly SC, has told the hearing's opening day that intense speculation about the rights or wrongs of the decisions made by the police marksmen and special operations commanders had been 'unhelpful'. Scroll down for video . It ended in 22 rounds from police, a total of five from Monis, but with the gunman still holding 21 shotgun rounds in his pocket the scene inside the Lindt cafe (pictured a day after the siege ended) might have been more bloody . Was this an act of terrorism? Mr Monis claimed in the Café that his actions were an attack on Australia by Islamic State. Apart from holding people up with a gun, he claimed (falsely as it turns out) to have bombs in his control . 'Questions concerning the use of police marksmen, whether to wait or to act immediately and other options have been discussed in public,' he said. 'All of us will have tried to imagine what it would be like to be caught up as these hostages so innocently were. 'All of us will have wondered how we would have reacted had we been trapped in the siege and faced the events of those 17 hours. 'Only armchair hostages have a confident answer to how they would have reacted and it is no part of the business of this inquest to form moral judgments about such matters or to engage in philosophical hypotheticals. Did he act alone? Man Haron Monis (pictured behind the Lindt cafe window soon after taking command of the cafe on the morning of December 15) may not have been a lone wolf and the coroner will examine if anyone else was involved in planning his deadly attack . Videos and audio recoridngs, possibly taken by hostages, will reveal what happened inside the siege  during the 17 hours, as well as how hostages (inclkuding John O'Brien, pictured, left) escaped  and why others remained inside until the violent end around 2am on day two . 'If there were defects in the management of the siege they will be exposed.' NSW police and law enforcement specialists are divided over whether the number of bullets shot was adequate or 'overkill', and whether Katrina Dawson might have survived if the incident had been approached differently. Mr Gormly revealed on Thursday at Glebe Coroner's Court the story of the siege's end as told by the stark details of the ballistics. Man Haron Monis fired five rounds from his sawn-off shot gun, three before the cafe was stormed including the cartridge he emptied into the head of the kneeling Tori Johnson while Monis fired from 75cm away. Fragments: fragments or ricochets from police bullets injured one police officer and three hostages,including Marcia Mikhael who was carried (pictured) from the siege with a foot wound . Monis, who was later found to have 21 shotgun cartridges in his pockets, would fire two more rounds from his weapon at entering police before he, too, was killed, as the entry team shot into the cafe's glass doors and windows, shattering them, and then burst in, throwing into the entrance 11 'flash bang' SF9 stun grenades which erupted into 99 small loud explosions. Officer A and Officer B then began firing. Monis was killed instantly by one of the two shots to his head and his body was peppered with a further 11 rounds. He had two rounds in his shotgun magazine and had been trying to reload when he was shot. Six fragments or ricochets from Officer A and Officer B's shots into the confines of the Lindt cafe hit Katrina Dawson, one causing her to bleed to death. Blwon to smithereens: The threat by Monis that he had 'radio=controlled' bombs in three places and wore a supposedly loaded backpack into the Lindt cafe menat that explosive experts (pictured, above) and the police netry team could not know it was all a hoax . Fragments or ricochets also hit three other hostages and one of the tactical response unit officers was struck in the face. As the emotions of the tragedy receded in the days and weeks following the siege, recriminations and blaming between police hierarchy, the office of the Director of Police Prosecutions, magistrates and others has clouded discussions, Daily Mail Australia has been told. Daily Mail Australia has spoken with current police officers and former siege and operations specialists who say police opinion is divided over whether the siege could have been handled better or differently, either by siege supervisors or by Army commandos based at Holdsworthy in western Sydney. Fatal wound: The inquest into the Sydney siege has revealed barrister Katrina Dawson (pictured, on the order of service for her funeral) was tragically hit by six bullet fragments, one of which hit a major artery, causing her death . Should troops have been called in? The inquest should settle whether troops such as the elite trained SAS should have been called in  to forgo a bloody end for hostages (pictured) shot after the 16 hour siege . 'But you have to remember that every single one of the entry team that went into that cafe faced the possibility that this would be the last job of their life,' a former special operations officer said. 'The terrorist could have had a bomb and could have blown the place to smithereens. The entry team had to be prepared to handle every single possibility, and preserve as many lives as possible.' Mr Gormly told the inquest of Thursday that the management of the siege was among many important issues would be investigated and laid bare during the inquest proper, which is not expected to begin until at least the middle of the year. Many witness: Hostages and police involved in the Martin Place siege will pack a courtroom for the inquest into the bloody incidentwhich will be hear later this yesar in a packed couttoom . Public risk: Security issues concerning Man Monis including if he being monitored willbe addressed along with issues as to how to protect the community and not end as the Sydney siege did with flowers laid for the dead (pictured) in Martin Place, Sydney . They include: . 1. Security issues concerning Mr Monis include the information held by NSW and Commonwealth government agencies concerning Mr Monis as a public security risk. For example was he being monitored at all, and if so, what emerged from any such surveillance? 2. Was this an act of terrorism? Mr Monis claimed in the Café that his actions were an attack on  Australia by Islamic State. Apart from holding people up with a gun, he claimed (falsely as it turns out) to have bombs in his control. At present it seems he had not established any contact with Islamic State before the siege though someone claiming to be from Islamic State adopted Mr Monis’ actions and his siege after his death. What terrorist associations, if any, did he have? 3. Bail. Did prosecuting authorities respond adequately to both the application, the applications for bail and its grant, for the charges he was facing at the time of the siege? 4. Mental health. Were there mental health issues for Mr Monis and what role did they play in his actions and behaviour? 5. How was the siege managed in any way and in every way? Was it regarded as a terrorist siege and how did that affect management of the siege? What options existed for management including use of police marksmen and other possible actions? By what process was the siege to be managed at the time of this siege, How did that plan work and how is it said to be assessed now?","The two police marksmen who stormed the Lindt cafe fired 22 rounds .

"Three British grandmothers cheated death when a bullet shot at them by a masked gunman missed by inches. The armed robber fired from close range when one woman, a grandmother of 14, tried to grab his gun when he ambushed them outside their Spanish holiday home. One of the women said: 'The bullet was head height and hit a wall behind us. He was less than six feet away when he fired. We came very close to going home in a body bag.' It is thought the man mistook the trio, all in their 60s, for their friend  who worked at a nearby bar in Malaga and had walked home with the night's takings. Armed robbery: The three British grandmothers had been in Malaga (pictured, file photo) for a few hours when they were shot at by a man in a balaclava . Self defence: The armed robber fired from close range when one woman tried to grab his gun when he ambushed them outside their Spanish holiday home (file photo) They had spent the evening with her only hours after arriving in Spain for a week's holiday in the village of Alcaucin, Malaga. A bar owner was shot and killed in nearby Colmar, apparently for drugs money, only an hour after the gunman fled. The dad-of-two's wallet had been stolen and £75 was missing from the bar's till. Spaniards Juan Montoya, 38, and Jose Mechine, 44, are being held in custody for the botched armed robbery and the murder of 56-year-old Tarek Nagib Botros. One of the trio, who asked not to be named, said: 'I thought at first it was someone playing a game when a man touched my friend on her shoulder and said in Spanish, ""Money, money"". 'When I turned round and saw a man with a Balaclava I had this sickening realisation he wasn't playing. 'I began to shout for help, reached for the gun to push it away from us and swore at him. It must have been the adrenalin rush. 'I took a step back when the gun came free and he took a step back and fired. I think it was out of anger at being frustrated by what he'd assumed would be a soft target. 'I had the impression he was aiming at me. The bullet was head height and hit a wall behind us. He was less than six feet away when he fired.' 'We knew there must be some connection when we heard a man had been shot dead nearby. 'We're just sorry someone had to die.' The Spanish pair in custody for both incidents used a car that one had bought on deposit from a gypsy in Malaga a few days earlier. Police suspect the buyer tried to frame him for the double crime by handing him the car back afterwards and telling him to keep the deposit. The two Spaniards blamed each other for the gun crimes when questioned by police. An investigating magistrate has remanded them in jail after quizzing them in a private court hearing and is expected to recommend formal charges after a short probe.","The three women, all in their 60s, had only been in Spain for a few hours .

"California health officials on Wednesday declared electronic cigarettes a health threat that should be strictly regulated like tobacco products, joining other states and health advocates across the U.S. in seeking tighter controls as 'vaping' grows in popularity. The California Department of Public Health report says e-cigarettes emit cancer-causing chemicals and get users hooked on nicotine but acknowledges that more research needs to be done to determine the immediate and long-term health effects. 'E-cigarettes are not as harmful as conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are not harmless' said California Health Officer Ron Chapman. 'They are not safe.' Safer than tobacco? Paul Frohman smokes an electronic cigarette outside an office building in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday - the same day that California declared the method of nicotine delivery to be unsafe . New generations of young people will become nicotine addicts if the products remain largely unregulated, Chapman said. Last year, 17 percent of high school seniors reported using e-cigarettes, known as vaping, according to the report. 'Without action, it is likely that California's more than two decades of progress to prevent and reduce traditional tobacco use will erode as e-cigarettes re-normalize smoking behavior,' the report says. E-cigarettes heat liquid nicotine into inhalable vapor without the tar and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes. A cartridge of nicotine can cost anywhere from $5 to $20 dollars and can be reused. California banned the sale of e-cigarettes to minors in 2010, but the report raises concerns about the products appeal to children with flavors such as cotton candy and gummy bear. Reports of children under 5 with e-cigarette poisoning jumped from seven in 2012 to 154 last year. Cross country: Tyler Newman, 24, vapes during his managing shift at the e-cigarette shop Infinite Vapor in Madison, Wisconsin . The California report says e-cigarettes emit as many as 10 toxic chemicals, but advocates say there is no evidence those substances are released at dangerous levels. 'Despite the health officer's false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping helps smokers quit and is far less hazardous than smoking,' Gregory Conley, president of the e-cigarette advocacy group American Vaping Association, said in an email. 'Smokers deserve truthful and accurate information about the relative risks of different nicotine products, not hype and conjecture based on cherry-picked reports.' Health officials called for restrictions on the marketing and sale of e-cigarettes, protections against accidental ingestion of liquid nicotine and an education campaign on the dangers of using e-cigarettes. A state senator introduced legislation this week that would regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products and ban their use in public places such as hospitals, bars and schools. A similar bill was defeated last year over opposition from tobacco companies. Enthusiastic: Geoff Braithwaite, owner of Tasty Vapor, exhales vapor after using an electronic cigarette. California health officials on Wednesday declared electronic cigarettes a health threat that should be strictly regulated like tobacco products . Chapman, the health official, would not take a position on legislation, but said his department would be rolling out an e-cigarette awareness campaign with possible television and radio advertisements. E-cigarettes have become more visible as they grow in popularity and commercials for the products air in places where traditional cigarette ads have been banned. Businesses related to e-cigarettes, including vaping lounges, are rapidly popping up in cities across California. Geoff Braithwaite, co-owner of an Oakland store that sells liquid nicotine for e-cigarettes, said he understands the need to restrict vaping in public and prevent sales to minors. He says his customers are longtime smokers who should be able to get a nicotine buzz without the harshness of a regular cigarette. 'Nicotine has all this stigma attached solely to the medium we used to use,' Braithwaite said. 'When you try to outright ban e-cigarettes, you're lumping in the solution with the problem.' Other states, including Oklahoma, Tennessee and Arkansas, already have issued advisories cautioning the use of e-cigarettes. Legislatures have been exploring restrictions on e-cigarette marketing, adding childproof packaging requirements and imposing taxes to discourage use. 'Health officials want to be proactive on this important public health issue,' said Lisa Waddell, who leads community health and prevention at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. 'The issue of real concern here is we really don't know everything that's in these products, and you are seeing the rise of use of these products in our children as well as our adults.'","'E-cigarettes are not as harmful as conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are not harmless' said California Health Officer Ron Chapman. 'They are not safe.'"
"An 'evil' policeman raped at least nine women to purposely infect them with HIV in a 10-year reign of terror, it is alleged. Ephraim Izmailov, 36, who was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2001, began preying on his victims in 2005 in Kaliningrad, a city in western Russia, according to police. Cruising the streets late at night in his patrol car, Izmailov would allegedly stop women he spotted by themselves and offer them a lift home. Ephraim Izmailov accosted lone women, locked them in his car and then raped them to infect them with HIV . He would then reportedly ask if they wanted sex and when they refused he would lock them in his vehicle and raped them. Over 10 years he 'deliberately and callously infected' at least nine victims, according to police. Officers are building a case against Izmailov, who is in custody, and are asking for more potential victims to come forward. If convicted, he faces life in prison for his crimes. A friend of one of the victims, Nikita Zaitseva, 29, said: 'My friend was walking home when he pulled over and asked her if she'd like a lift. 'He told her he was a policeman and even showed her his ID. 'Thinking that he was genuine and honest she got in and he then drove her to a deserted part of the city and raped her. 'He then dumped her on the ground and told her he had HIV and she now did too. Ismailov would prowl the streets of the western Russian city of Kaliningrad in his car hunting for victims . 'He is an evil, evil man.' Izmailov was captured after one of his victims managed to remember his car number plate. A police spokesman said: 'Over a 10-year period he raped and deliberately and callously infected his victims. 'He has shown no remorse whatsoever. 'We have had nine women come forward so far but we suspect there are many, many more. 'We are appealing for anyone who was attacked by this man to come forward.'

"A new photo of the shadowy leader of a violent rebel group deemed too radical by Al Qaeda has been released by the Iraqi interior ministry. The release of the image of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is part of a renewed push by Iraq to catch the man whose militant group, called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has carried out attacks responsible for killing a large number of Iraqis. ISIS is also known for the brutal rule it enforces in the Syrian towns it takes over. Al Qaeda recently released a formal statement distancing itself from the group and its actions. Most wanted: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a new image released by the Iraq Interior Ministry and in an earlier photograph circulated by the US-based National Counter-terrorism Centre . The Iraqi Government obtained the photograph of Baghdadi along with three handwritten letters, AFP reported. 'The security forces call on the people to provide any information that helps lead to the arrest of this criminal,' said the statement that was posted with the photograph. ISIS is the most extreme group carrying out attacks against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and has fought against other moderate rebel groups in Syria. Baghdadi is suspected to be living in Syria, where ISIS holds its headquarters in the city of Raqqa. A group of men hold their rifles during clashes between the Free Syrian Army and the ISIS . He is known as 'The Ghost' to members of the pro-Assad Lebanese Shi-ite militia Hizballah. 'Only a few people know the face of Baghdadi,' Sheik Ahmad, the Hizballah official in charge of investigating ISIS in Syria, told TIME last year. The secretive Baghdadi talks with a scarf covering his face even when dealing with close allies, according to militants who worked with him in Iraq. He addresses his ISIS followers through audio recordings posted to the internet, rather than in public places. A recent CNN report about ISIS’s brutal rule focussed on the Syrian town of Addana, which was overtaken by ISIS forces before they were driven out a month ago. Locals said public executions were carried out often and bodies were left to rot in the street.","New image released by Iraqi government of leader of hard line rebel group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)

"Shoplifters have been posting DVDs and stolen goods to themselves from a Post Office inside an Asda store. Thieves have been picking up box-sets, films, computer games and CDs from the entertainment department of the Ellesmere Port store in Cheshire. They then put the items into envelopes and take them to the in-store Post Office to send them to themselves - meaning they don't have to try and sneak the stolen goods past security. The Asda Supercentre in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire has been forced to move padded envelopes and boxes . The store's bosses have now been forced to put padded envelopes and postage boxes behind a desk in a bid to stop the scam. It is not known for how long thieves have been using the method to steal from the shop, but the dishonest scheme came to light when a customer could not find packing boxes in the store. In a Facebook post reported in the Liverpool Echo, the customer wrote: 'Upon asking at the Post Office counter where I might find a large parcel packet, I was told to go to the other end of the store. 'Asking the guy behind the counter why they keep post office accessories behind the entertainment desk, he told me the funniest reason ever.' Thieves had been putting DVDs, computer games and CDs into padded envelopes then sending them to their home address, to avoid having to pass through security gates . The Facebook message added: 'It's because people used to pick them off the shelves, stuff DVDs and such like into them from the store, then post it back to themselves. 'The Post Office then takes it away without you going through the alarm gate.' An Asda spokesman said: 'We take shoplifting very seriously and work with the local police to ensure this doesn't happen in our stores. 'This allows us to continue to offer the low prices that customers expect from Asda.'","Bosses forced to move envelopes and boxes to stop thieves' new scam .

"Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik . has a rare, high-functioning form of Asperger's that has left him . incapable of empathy or real friendship, one of Norway's most prominent . psychiatrists has told a court in Oslo. Professor Ulrik Fredrik Malt of Olso University told the court: 'It is plausible that there is Asperger's, Tourette's, and a narcissistic personality disorder.' As . evidence, he cited the lack of emotion Breivik showed when discussing . those he killed, his impressive memory for details, his obsession with . numbers, his hypergraphia [obsessive writing], and his monotonous tone . of voice. Testimony: Ulrik Fredrik Malt, a professor of psychiatry, testifies in the case against terror and murder charged Anders Behring Breivik at a court in Oslo . Deliberation: Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen listens to arguments today as legal teams debate the sanity of Breivik. The defendant himself has instructed his lawyers to fight that he is sane . All of these, he said, were evidence of 'functional disorders of the brain lobes'. Breivik angrily interrupted Professor Malt's testimony, complaining that his claims were 'insulting' and 'abusive'. But when given the opportunity to comment at the end of the day, he was cooly ironic. He said: 'I would like to congratulate Professor Malt for his well-executed character assassination. Aspergers: Breivik reacted with anger at claims he was suffering mental illness, saying that the testimony of Professor Malt was 'insulting' 'In the beginning I was quite offended, but in the end I thought it was pretty funny. The premises outlined are not true.' The . 33-year-old extremist has instructed his lawyers to fight for him to be . declared sane, even though this would mean he spends the next 21 years . in prison, rather than in a secure mental hospital. As he has confessed to killing 77 people during his massacre last July, his sanity is the key question at the trial. Professor . Malt argued that Breivik did not appear to suffer from the absurd, . bizarre delusions or hallucinations normal for a schizophrenic, so he . did not agree with the conclusions of the first psychiatic report . received by the court, which concluded he was insane. But . he agreed that Breivik could not be treated as responsible for his . actions, contradicting a second psychiatric report, which argued Breivik . was criminally accountable. Prfessor . Malt said: 'It is important that we take on board that this is . something much more than only a pure right-wing extremist. 'It . is a tragedy for Norway, and for us. But I believe it is also a tragedy . for Breivik. The first time I saw Breivik coming into the hall, I did . not see a monster. I saw a deeply lonely man.' He said that Asperger's would explain the problems Breivik's mother had . with her son when he was four years old, leading the two of them to . spend several months staying at Norway's National Center for Child and . Adolescent Psychiatry. Breivik's . mother, Wench Behring, has also described him as being constantly . thirsty, a symptom Professor Malt said was frequently displayed by young . Asperger's sufferers. Breivik's . violent acts could also be the result of a version of Tourette's . syndrome, which is associated with Asperger's. He said had observed that . Breivik suffered frequent suppressed tics. Prosecution: Director of public prosecutions, Tor Aksel Busch (left), and public prosecutor Svein Holden arrive in court today to hear the testimony of mental health experts .

"For four years, beginning when she was just 13 years old, Madison Reed lived her life in front of cameras - only she did know about because her neighbor had secretly planted recording devices in her room. The Beaverton, Oregon, girl, who is now 18 years old, only found out about the outrageous violation of her privacy six months ago when he mother discovered a tiny camera stashed under a heap of papers in her bedroom. On Tuesday, 48-year-old-old Bradley McCollum, a one-time friend of the Reed family, pleaded guilty in Washington County circuit court to charges of burglary and invasion of personal privacy - both misdemeanors. Scroll down for video . Peeping Tom: Bradley McCollum, 48 (left), has pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and invasion of personal privacy - both misdemeanors - for videotaping his friend's young daughter, Madison Reed (right), for four years . Shocking find: In August, Madison's mother discovered a small camera hidden under some papers in her daughter's bedroom (pictured) As part of a plea deal, he is expected to be sentenced March 10 to two years in prison - a decision the victim and her parents have decried as a 'slap on the wrist.' Prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to prove he was guilty of a sex crime, which means that upon his release McCollum will not be required to register as a sex offender. Speaking to KGW this week, Madison and her parents said McCollum is getting off too easy considering the heinousness of the crime, and all because under state law recording a minor with a hidden camera is not a felony. ‘It doesn't make sense at all because I don't know why it's not child pornography,’ Madison said. ‘I was underage at the time and the intent of what he did was so obvious. 'Slap on the wrist': As part of a plea deal, McCollum is expected to be sentenced March 10 to two years in prison, and he will not be required to register as a sex offender . A police investigation has revealed that in 2010, Bradley McCollum, a close friend and neighbor of the Reeds, planted a camera at his beach house to spy on Madison whenever the family visited him. Last July, McCollum slipped a second recording device into Madison's bedroom, taping hours of footage showing the teenage girl naked and in various state of undress. About two weeks later, Madison's father, Clark Reed, became alarmed when he spotted his friend near his daughter's room, and a short time later his wife came upon a camera smaller than a smartphone hidden under some papers on a dresser. Madison, who is now 18, says it has been difficult for her to get over the trauma, and to this day she cannot shake off the feeling that she is being watched. 'I don't like to think about it, but I think about it all the time. Like all day,' Miss Reed told the station, adding that in order to put her mind at ease her parents had taped the blinds in her room to the wall. Madison and her father, Clark Reed (right), said McCollum is getting off too easy because under state law, recording a minor with a hidden camera is not a felony . The Reed family are now pushing for state lawmakers to pass legislation that would upgrade hidden camera crimes to sexual offenses with stiffer penalties. Former Oregon state Representative Denyc Boles, a Republican from Salem, has proposed a bill that would make the charge of invasion of personal privacy an automatic felony if the victim is under 18 years and carry a maximum penalty of five years and prison. Boles' bill would also require people convicted of felony invasion of personal privacy to register as sex offenders if they have a prior sex crime conviction.","Bradley McCollum, 48, pleaded guilty to burglary and invasion of personal privacy for taping his friend's daughter beginning when she was 13 .

"You don't need to run a marathon or become a bodybuilder to protect your heart. It takes just 10 minutes of exercise a day to drastically reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said today. Making small changes are the key to improving worsening lifestyle habits, the charity added. Its new healthy living campaign   comes after a study revealed deteriorating trends in the nation's diet and exercise habits. Scroll down for video . It takes just 10 minutes of exercise a day to drastically reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke, the British Heart Foundation says . Research by the charity found that less than a third of adults in England (30 per cent) eat five pieces of fruit and veg a day. A third of men and nearly half of women do not do the recommended two and a half hours of physical activity a week. Lack of time and motivation topped the list of barriers people reported were stopping them living a healthier lifestyle. The research showed 41 per cent of people admit they are worried about the effect that their current diet and exercise habits has on their health. Almost 23 per cent said their family or work commitments get in the way of them leading as healthy a lifestyle as they would like. One in five said losing motivation is the biggest barrier stopping them from being more healthy. Meanwhile, another fifth say they often set themselves goals for improving their lifestyle, but usually fail - twice the number who say they succeed (nine per cent). Simply standing up for three hours a day is as good for you as running ten marathons a year, an expert has claimed. Dr Mike Loosemore, Lead Consultant in Exercise Medicine at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health said doing small amounts of exercise should not be thought of as 'pointless', . The Government's official guidelines on exercise are impractical and can seem an impossible task for many people. Even small amounts of exercise - including standing - can have health benefits, he said. ‘It’s going to improve their health, it’s going to reduce their risk of heart disease, diabetes, it’s going to reduce their risk of cancer, it’s going to reduce their cholesterol and it’s going to make them thinner,’ he said. More than a quarter (26 per cent) of people say they would be more successful in attempts to improve their health if they had more money. More than one in six (15 per cent) said they would change their habits if they didn't have to dedicate as much time to health. Another fifth said they would be healthier if they could share more activities with a group or partner. Nearly half of UK adults (44 per cent) said they never do any moderate physical activity. More than one in eight (13 per cent) spend more than 8.5 hours a day sedentary - a figure higher than the European average. Households are also buying fewer vegetables per person, with a six per cent decline between 2005 and 2012, . They are simultaneously consuming more than the recommended levels of saturated fat and salt. Now the BHF is encouraging people to 'start small' by taking at least 10 minutes every day to make a small change towards a healthier lifestyle during February's Heart Month. Catherine Kelly, of the BHF, said: 'The public have told us loud and clear that time and motivation are fundamental barriers to a healthy lifestyle. 'We have to listen to their concerns and during this Heart Month we are offering people manageable and realistic guidance to help make small changes to their extremely busy routines. 'We know that changing the simplest everyday habits can make a big difference - from getting off the bus two stops early to eating more fruit and veg, and building bite-sized chunks of physical activity in to your everyday life.' The charity's survey showed 41 per cent of people admit they are worried about the effect that their current diet and exercise habits has on their health . Cardiovascular disease accounts for one in four of all UK deaths and around seven million people are living with it. The charity's campaign comes after a leading expert said the Government's official guidelines on exercise are impractical and can seem an impossible task for many people.

"Arsenal remain favourites to sign Petr Cech from Chelsea should they pay the £7million asking price. AC Milan, Roma and Real Madrid have all shown an interest while his agent maintains Liverpool are also in the frame. Cech, 32, who starred for the Czech Republic last week, wants to play regularly after being displaced by Thibaut Courtois as Chelsea's No 1. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho dismisses 'Mickey Mouse' Petr Cech rumours . Petr Cech has been displaced as Chelsea No 1 by Thibaut Courtois and is available for transfer . Courtois (right) has established himself as one of the world's finest goalkeepers . However, speaking at Chelsea's press conference on Friday, ahead of this weekend's Premier League clash at home to West Brom; Blues boss Jose Mourinho revealed he hasn't received any offers for Cech. 'On my desk, normally from my board's desk the information arrives, I have zero. Zero proposals. At this moment, Petr Cech is our goalkeeper and has a contract for two more years,' Mourinho said. 'He's a fantastic professional and puts the team's interests first. Not once has Petr Cech knocked on my door to inform me of his desire to accept some proposal. This is my truth. Nothing more I can say.' Cech's agent Viktor Kolar last month said: 'He [Cech] wants to be at a club that regularly plays in the Champions League and this is his highest aspiration. He wants to return to being a protagonist in a great squad at a great club.' Milan have already taken Michael Essien, Fernando Torres and Marco van Ginkel from Chelsea, albeit the latter two on loan, but signed Diego Lopez from Real Madrid in the summer. Lopez was a firm favourite of Mourinho's at the Bernabeu and there are rumblings he could be offered as a makeweight in any deal. However, Lopez is eager to remain No 1 himself. Wojciech Szczesny (centre) is Arsenal's first-choice keeper but has suffered from inconsistent form . VIDEO Cech issues Chelsea threat . Arsene Wenger has long placed his trust in Wojciech Szczesny, but the Poland keeper has suffered spells of inconsistent form and has been criticised for crucial losses of concentration. Cech, meanwhile, is a proven winner, boasting a bulging medal haul including three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the 2012 Champions League and 2013 Europa League following 10 years at the core of Chelsea's team. Cech's agent Viktor Kolar says a January move for the Chelsea goalkeeper is unlikely unless one of Europe's top sides suffers an injury to their first-choice keeper. Speaking to the Czech media on Friday, Kolar said a switch is still in the balance. 'In the football world you can never rule out anything definitively, however if you put together the facts with Petr's ambitions of a top-class goalkeeper, you will not be left with too many options,' said Kolar. 'If we add to this the actual little need of these few clubs to search a new goalkeeper in the winter's transfer window, then you will find out that the chance of a transfer in the next weeks or months is not very high.' Cech's asking price is low at £7m but reflects Chelsea's respect for one of their club legends .","Petr Cech now second choice at Chelsea behind Thibaut Courtois .

"Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, is revealing details from the couple's wedding - and the touching phrase he had inscribed inside her wedding ring. 'One of the lines in our wedding vows was, 'I will remind you who you are when you forget,' revealed Taya in an interview with People, which hits newsstands this Friday. She then added that inside her wedding ring, Chris, the subject for the new film American Sniper, had inscribed; 'All of me. My love, my life.' Scroll down for video . The widow of Chris Kyle, Taya (above), is revealing details of the couple's wedding . They areportrayed by Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller (above) in the new film American Sniper . This after Taya says she spent most of the time her husband served overseas afraid he would not return home to her and their . 'I had so much practice of being afraid Chris was dead, hearing the gunfights on the phone when I called him overseas,' she explains. That being said, he still amde time for romance, with Taya saying he would send emails that said; 'I just want to be home with you.' His commitment to his work also made life difficult for her and the couple's two children, with Taya admitting they sometimes 'felt like we were less important than the military.' Things also became difficult when Chris returned home. 'There were times we did not think we were going to make it,' says Taya. Now, Taya is at work on her own book, American Widow, and wishing that Chris were still around to see the response to Sniper, which was recently nominated for six Academy Awards, including nods for Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Chris. 'It makes me emotional when i think about how he would react, because I want him here.' And while Taya is sure Chris would be in awe of the film, she also feels her humble husband would feel a little weird as well with everyone talking about him. 'I can see him being uncomfortable with all the attention,' says Taya. 'All of me. My love, my life,' wrote Chris inside Taya's weddign ring (above with Cooper at the film's premiere) 'I will remind you who you are when you forget,' said Taya to Chris (above) in their wedding vows . The film tells the story of her husband who was raised in rural Texas and started out working as a cowboy. He applied to join the SEALs but was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms. However, in the late Nineties, the unit relaxed its entrance requirements and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper. Spotting his obvious talent, the military sent him to SEAL sniper school, where he was taught how to perform warfare's loneliest and most controversial job. In 2004, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, and it was during the battle for that city where he first made his mark. However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Mr Kyle gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs. One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole. Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry. In February 2013 he and a friend, Chad Littlefield, took 25-year old Eddie Ray Routh to a remote shooting range in Glen Rose, Texas. Before they reached the range Routh, 25, shot both men dead and stole Kyle's customized pick up truck. Routh's family claimed he was suffering from PTSD and had mental issues. His trial on two murder charges begins in February.","In a new interview, Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, is revealing details of the couple's wedding .

"Newly crowned Masters champion Bubba Watson was heading back to be with his newly-adopted baby son today - hours after putting on his green jacket. The golfer, 33, and his wife Angie celebrated adopting a one-month-old boy called Caleb just a fortnight ago. Bubba, a big-hitting golfer, last night won the Masters after hitting a dramatic 250-yard shot on his way to victory on an extraordinary final day at Augusta. Baby joy: Bubba Watson with his wife Angie and their new adopted son Caleb who is now six-weeks old . He defeated South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen on the second hole in a play-off to win his first major title. And it was double joy for the golfer from Bagdad, Florida, who became a father for the first time after adopting because his wife Angie is unable to have children. After sealing a dramatic victory, Bubba said he was looking forward to going home to see his boy - but admitted he had not yet changed a nappy.

He said: 'I can't wait to get back. I haven't changed a diaper yet so probably going to have to change a . diaper pretty soon. 'I don't want to change a diaper. Hopefully this will give me a week or two to just watch her again. Maybe . not, though.' The golfer won $1.44million . (£900,000) in prize money as he won his first major.

Yesterday he broke down and cried hard on his mother Molly's shoulder as they embraced on the 10th green.

Garry introduced him to golf when he . took him to a golf course aged six. And despite becoming a dedicated . player he never had a formal lesson in his life. He doesn't employ a coach or a sports psychologist to improve his game - and his go for broke playing style is unique. Bubba, a committed Christian, said after his Easter Sunday win: 'My dad's not here, but he's watching in heaven.' The golfer, who has one of the longest drives in the sport, has always been regarded as a poor putter.

Winner: Bubba Watson of the United States walks up the 18th fairway during the final round of the 2012 Masters Tournament .

Oosthuizen who looked set to win by making four consecutive birdies on . holes 13 through to 16.

Just tap it in: Bubba Watson sinks a birdie putt on the 16th green on his way to victory in Augusta, Georgia yesterday . Masters champion Bubba Watson was given his unusual name by his father. Although he was named Gerry when he was born he has always been known by his more folksy name. The golfer claimed his father Garry named him Bubba because he was a fat and ugly child. Garry Watson - who first introduced his son to the sport he conquered yesterday - died from throat cancer in 2010. Bubba said it was his father who gave him his unusual name. 'I’d say 10 seconds after I was born, my . daddy took a good look at me,' the golfer said in a previous interview. 'He said I was so fat . and ugly, ""Let's call him Bubba.""' The nickname Bubba is given to the oldest male child in a family in some southern U.S. states. For some the nickname sticks. It is an endearing name sometimes given to overweight men - which is probably why Bubba's father gave him the name when his large baby was born. Former President Bill Clinton was given the nickname Bubba in many of the southern states. Watson and his wife Angie started the process of adopting four years ago. 'It finally came to this winter that we could do it,' he said. 'We got turned down a couple times, but on the Tuesday of Bay Hill (three weeks ago) we got a call, on the Wednesday we made the decision and the Monday after we were down in South Florida, picking up little Caleb.' Bubba's wife Angie, a former Olympic-standard basketball player, stands head and shoulders above other golfing WAGs at 6ft 4in tall. She met Bubba when they were both at the University Of Georgia and they got married in September 2004. The basketball player told Bubba on their first date they she would never be able to have children. When injury finally put paid to her professional career, she decided to do become her husband's agent. Asked if he had dreamed about a putt to win The Masters he added: 'I dreamed about it - I just never made the putt.' He won the tournament with a tap in from six inches. 'I wanted to make sure I focused hard . on that putt, because I knew how delicate these situations are and how . this may never happen again.' Oosthuizen was trying to become the . first South African winner in five years after Trevor Immelman and last . year's champion Charl Schwartzel.

"President Barack Obama played down the rocky relationship he and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have had throughout the Pentagon chief's two-year tenure at a retirement ceremony on Wednesday afternoon. 'In an era of politics that too often descends into spectacle, you’ve always served with decency and dignity. And in a town of outsized egos, you’ve never lost your Midwestern humility,' Obama said of Hagel, a Nebraska native. 'You’ve always been frank and honest and said what you thought. And I have so profoundly benefited from that candor,' Obama added. Scroll down for video . Fondly recalling their time serving in the Senate together and calling outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel a 'friend,' Obama sought to avoid turning a celebration of the former combat soldier's 30 years of service into a haranguing today . Fondly recalling their time serving in the Senate together and calling Hagel a 'friend,' Obama sought to avoid turning the celebration of the former combat soldier's 30 years of service into a haranguing. A military man turned politician, Hagel represented Nebraska in the U.S. Senate for two terms before leaving the upper chamber in 2009 to work in academia. Obama plucked him out of retirement from public service in 2013 to serve as one of his top military advisers. The relationship between the two men of opposing political parties soon soured, however, and less than two years after taking the position, Hagel resigned, reportedly under pressure from the president himself. Obama said at a ceremony announcing the departure in November that it was Hagel's decision to leave. But the White House has since maintained that he and Hagel 'arrived together at the determination that new leadership should take over' at the Pentagon. A senior Pentagon official told NBC News at the time that Hagel was asked to step down because the president no longer had confidence in his ability to lead the military as it struggled to defeat Islamic extremists waging war in the Middle East. 'He wasn’t up to the job,' the official said. Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters that wasn't true and that Hagel 'has been the right person for the job, and he has performed to the president's expectations in a way... [that] will contribute to the ongoing effort that has made the US military the most powerful force for good in the world.' Still, Earnest admitted that the challenges now facing the Pentagon are different that those that were at the forefront when he was nominated for Defense Secretary. At that time, Earnest said, 'the threat that was posed by ISIL was not nearly as significant as it is now.' 'The priorities of the department, or at least of the new secretary, have changed given changes in the international community,' he said. 'It doesn't mean that Secretary Hagel hasn't done an excellent job of managing these crises as they have popped up,' Earnest continued, but it does mean 'that another secretary might be better suited to meet those challenges - that was something the two of them agreed.' Less than two years after being nominated to lead the Pentagon, Hagel resigned in November, reportedly under pressure from the president . Today Earnest's stand-in, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz, said 'friction' between the White House and the Pentagon is 'something that predates this administration.' Asked specifically about Hagel's predecessors, Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, both of whom wrote scathing critiques of their time in the Obama administration once they'd exited the president's service, Schultz said the president and his staff 'always deeply value and respect the input of our military leadership.' 'That's something that is placed at paramount value here at the White House and something that goes into every consideration the President makes as Commander-in-Chief.' Schultz said the White House believes it has 'good relationships with the military leaders.' 'And most importantly the President has an open ear, and values their input around the table or over the telephone,' he stated. The president has nominated former Pentagon official Ash Carter to serve as the next Secretary of Defense. He's expected to undergo a smooth confirmation process. Senators on the Armed Services committee will question Carter next week. A vote of the full Senate on his nomination will likely come soon after that, allowing Hagel to finally leave his post more than two months after formally offering the president his resignation. Hagel said today that he'd 'cherished' leading the Department of Defense, but 'of all the opportunities my life has given me, I am most proud of having once been a soldier' Despite alleged differences that ultimately cost Hagel his job, Obama had nothing but praise for the 68-year-old veteran at this afternoon's ceremony. Thanks to Hagel's 'guiding hand,' Obama said today, the Pentagon is 'better positioned for the future.' His 'greatest impact' perhaps,Obama said, 'a legacy that will be felt for decades to come' is the example he set for the nation's men and women in uniform. 'It’s not simply that you’ve been the first enlisted combat veteran and the first Vietnam veteran to serve as Secretary of Defense. It’s how your life experience - being down in the mud, feeling the bullets fly overhead - has allowed you to connect with our troops like no other Secretary before you.' Obama said he's 'grateful to Chuck on a very personal level.' 'Exactly 10 years ago this month, I joined you in the United States Senate, along with the Vice President,' he recalled. 'I was new and green; you were a veteran legislator. I was the student, and you shared some of the lessons of your service. I was young and you were....well,' he trailed off, eliciting laughter from attendees. Speaking before the president, Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, heaped on Hagel's 'incredible' and 'remarkable' record of service. 'His resolve is simply as solid as steel,' Dempsey said, 'but his love of his country is even stronger.' Vice President Joe Biden, another former colleague of Hagel's in the Senate, said the outgoing Defense head has the type of 'integrity' that everyone who has ever served with him in any capacity agrees 'is recognizable immediately.' Biden, a close friend of Hagel's who reportedly opposed his ousting, said he was 'truly going to personally miss' working with his friend. 'Thank you for all you've done....all you've done for me, all you've done for the country,' Biden said. 'I'm proud to call you a friend' he said, 'and I'm proud to stand by you as a Secretary of Defense about to retire.' Hagel told Gen. Marting Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right, 'I have been very fortunate to have you as my partner in this job. especially during those spirited ""self-help"" and ""educational"" opportunities called congressional hearings' After Obama's remarks, Hagel took the stage and thanked Obama for allowing him to serve on his cabinet for the last two years. To Dempsey he said, 'I have been very fortunate to have you as my partner in this job. 'Especially during those spirited ""self-help"" and ""educational"" opportunities called congressional hearings,' he joked. He additionally thanked his wife, Lilibet, and replacement Ash Carter, whom he commended for his previous service at the Pentagon and 'for his continued commitment to public service.' Hagel also set aside a few minutes of his speech to offer his view on international affairs. 'We must recognize that there is not an immediate answer to every problem', he said that some challenges require the 'patience to seek higher ground' to get the intended results. The world is not 'moving toward less complicated' challenges, he said, in fact, challenges are becoming more global, and countries need to focus on how to 'solve problems through coalitions of common interests.' 'With all of the world's trials and problems it is still a hopeful world, this I believe,' he concluded. Hagel said he'd 'cherished' leading the Department of Defense, but 'of all the opportunities my life has given me, I am most proud of having once been a soldier. 'The lessons from my time in uniform about trust, responsibility, duty, judgment, and loyalty to your fellow soldier...these I have carried with me throughout my life,' he remarked.","'I have so profoundly benefited from that candor,' Obama said today in a speech commemorating Hagel's 30 years of service .

"A 18-month-old girl was pulled from the wreckage of a car crash without a scratch, despite four passengers including her mother dying in the horror accident, an inquest heard today. Holly Hind was the only person to survive when the family car she was travelling in smashed head-on into a tanker and flew into the air. Holly's mother Alison Hind, 28, was tragically killed along with her uncle Martyn Pugh, 47, after a summer trip to the seaside. Miracle toddler: Holly Hind was the only person to survive when the family car she was travelling in smashed head-on into a tanker at 50mph and flew into the air . Mr Pugh's parents-in-law John Kehoe, 72, and Margaret, 65, who had joined them on the outing, were also killed in the accident, which happened on a country road near Aberystwyth, Wales. An inquest heard how van driver Marcus Stallard, 42, pulled Holly from her car seat while surrounded by the twisted wreckage and her dead mother. Mr Stallard said: 'None of the doors would open and there was silence, just silence. 'Then I heard a child starting to cry and realised there was someone still alive in the car. Tragic: Holly's mother Alison Hinds (L) who died in the crash, pictured with Holly's father Steve Hughes who is currently caring for her . 'I tried to open the doors but couldn't, so I ran to my van and grabbed a hammer. I started smashing the windows to help the child and I managed to get her out of the car.' Holly miraculously survived the crash with just a faint red mark on her forehead - despite the family Ford Focus travelling at around 50mph when it collided with the tanker. Mr Stallard took Holly in his arms and tried to comfort her until an Air Ambulance arrived at the scene on the A44  in Llangurig, near Aberystwyth, and flew Holly  80 miles to hospital. Scene: The 'dangerous' A44 in Powys was closed for 12 hours after the tragic crash . Died: Martyn Pugh, Holly's uncle, was driving the Ford Focus when it collided with the tanker at 50mph on a country road near Aberystwyth, Wales . Also killed: Mr Pugh's parents-in-law John Kehoe, 72, and Margaret, 65, who had joined them on the outing, also died in the accident . Holly's father Steve Hughes, 36, raced to her bedside at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and is now caring for her with the help of remaining family members. Witnesses said they saw the Ford Focus 'stand up' on its front end with the force of the crash before smashing back down on to the road and spinning into the path of Mr Stallard's Ford Transit van. The inquest at Welshpool, Mid Wales, heard that the cause of the crash remained a mystery. PC Richard Jessop said it could have been a 'momentary lapse of concentration' by Mr Pew which cause him to veer across the road. PC Jessop examined all three vehicles after the crash and said none of them showed any sign of defects or mechanical problems. Lost her mother: Holly (right) was pulled from the twisted wreckage of the car with her dead mother Alison (left) just inches away from her . Point of collision: The Ford Focus was travelling on the A44 in Llangurig, near Aberystwyth, when it hit the tanker head on.  An inquest at Welshpool, Mid Wales today recorded verdicts of accidental death . Neither van driver Marcus Stallard or the tanker driver John Knight were injured in the horror smash. Powys coroner Andrew Barkley said: 'We will never know the cause of the crash but it could have been a momentary lapse of concentration by Mr Pew or a distraction from inside or outside the car.' Mr Barkley recorded verdicts of accidental death. Traumatic: An inquest heard how van driver Marcus Stallard, 42, pulled Holly from her car seat while surrounded by the twisted wreckage and her dead mother Alison . After the inquest family member Tony Kehoe said Holly, now two, was being looked after well by her father in close knit village of Llanidloes. He said: 'Holly is being well looked after by her father and members of the family. 'She is coming on well and doesn't seem to have been affected by the tragedy.

"A 22-year-old Florida man was acting out song lyrics with a 17-year-old Monday evening, when he discharged a gun and killed the teenage boy, deputies said Tuesday. Rodney Clay Patrick Jr. faces manslaughter, tampering with evidence, and possession of a controlled substance charges, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office (BSCO) said in a release. Deputies said the shooting of Douglay Trey Winslow took place at Patrick's Merritt Island home. Deputies told WESH that the duo were acting out Wacka Flocka's 'Bustin At 'Em.' The television station pointed out that the song includes the line 'Shoot first, ask questions last.' The line 'Pow, pow, pow, pow' is also uttered repeatedly throughout the song. Shooting: Deputies have charged Rodney Patrick Jr., left, in the shooting death of Douglas Winslow, right . Shooting: Deputies have said that the duo were acting out Wacka Flocka's 'Bustin At 'Em.' Patrick's Facebook profile includes several photos of him posing with a gun in a bathroom . In a 911 call obtained by WKMG, Patrick says 'I handed my little brother my gun, and I didn't know it was loaded, and he shot himself in the head.' He later explains to the operator that the victim is actually the younger brother of his girlfriend. 'It was a Colt, it was my 45,' Patrick says on the call. 'He just wanted to see it, he thought it was so cool. I thought I had cleared it and everything.' 'Oh my God, that poor kid,' Patrick says at one point. 'He had so much to live for and I'm stupid for handing him that f****** gun.' The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said in a release 'The investigation determined that the two men were at the residence listening to music when Patrick picked up the firearm, which he thought was not loaded and started acting out the lyrics of the song, which included pointing the firearm at the victim when it discharged, killing the victim.' The sheriff's office also stated that  Patrick is being held without bond. Gun selfies: Patrick is seen facing a bathroom mirror in these gun selfies. They were uploaded to Facebook in March 2013 . Victim: Deputies say Douglas Winslow was killed by Rodney Patrick. Patrick is now facing a manslaughter charge, as well as charges for tampering with evidence and possession of a controlled substance . Scene: Deputies said the shooting took place at Patrick's Merritt Island home . Speaking to Florida Today, Major Todd Goodyear with the BSCO said 'It's a terrible accident, but there are consequences to your actions. You have to take responsibility. [Patrick] pointed that gun at a person and pulled the trigger.' 'Patrick tried to make it look like the victim shot himself and moved things around,' Goodyear said. Florida Today noted that Patrick's Facebook profile includes several photos of him posing with a gun in a bathroom. Those photographs were uploaded in March 2013. Patrick's grandmother Virginia Hudmon told the newspaper 'I talked with [Patrick] yesterday and he's real upset about what happened. It was accidental and he was very, very close to that boy.' Humon also said 'I tried to talk with Patrick by phone yesterday and he told me he would tell me later...he said ""Mom, you know it was an accident. You know I loved Trey.""'","Rodney Patrick was acting out song lyrics with Douglas Winslow when he discharged a gun and killed the teenage boy, deputies said .

"An adult son of southern Nevada rancher and states' rights advocate Cliven Bundy said he spent a night in a southern Utah jail after sheriff's deputies accused him of resisting arrest when he appeared in a justice court for an unrelated code violation summons. Ryan Bundy, 42, said on Wednesday that a judge in Cedar City freed him without bail and set a court date in March on the misdemeanor resisting charge and a misdemeanor case of interfering with an animal control officer that Bundy thinks stems from 2013. 'Interfering with what? I didn't understand it,' Bundy said. He said he pleaded not guilty to both charges. Night in jail: Ryan Bundy, the son of southern Nevada rancher and states' rights advocate Cliven Bundy, spent a night in a southern Utah county jail after sheriff's deputies accused him of resisting arrest . Resisting authority: Cliven Bundy's home and melon farm in Bunkerville hosted a tense standoff last April between well-armed backers of the ranching family and federal agents trying to round up Bundy cattle from public land in a grazing fee dispute . The Salt Lake Tribune reported that the animal control officer case stems from allegations that Bundy improperly removed a horse that had been impounded after it was found loose near Cedar City Regional Airport. Bundy was booked into jail on Tuesday after scuffling with deputies and telling them he wouldn't be arrested, Iron County sheriff Sgt. Nik Johnson said. Bundy, a rancher and former construction company owner, said the summons was for a code violation relating to a vehicle parked on property he owns in the southern Utah county of Iron County. He said he now lives in Bunkerville, Nevada, about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Bundy's family home and melon farm is in Bunkerville. It was the scene of a tense standoff last April between well-armed backers of the ranching family patriarch and federal agents trying to round up Bundy cattle from public land in a grazing fee dispute. Federal Bureau of Land Management agents withdrew, and Cliven Bundy became a symbol for resisting authority. Another Bundy son, Cliven Lance Bundy, 34, is jailed in Las Vegas and faces two to eight years in Nevada state prison at a Clark County District Court hearing February 4 after having been dropped from a court diversion program for violating probation. Lance Bundy pleaded guilty February 2013 to felony burglary and weapon theft charges but had remained out of prison while he was enrolled in the drug user counseling and diversion program.

"Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain uncorked a scathing attack on anti-war protesters who interrupted an Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday, earning applause by barking, 'Get out of here, you low-life scum!' Activists with the far-left pacifist group CodePink stood with banners when former secretary of state Henry Kissinger entered the room, accusing him of committing war crimes during his tenure as America's top diplomat and as the national security adviser. They shook handcuffs in his face and chanted 'Arrest Henry Kissinger for war crimes' while McCain, who chaired the hearing about global threats to the U.S., sat dumbfounded and embarrassed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CODEPINK, AGAIN: Interruptions by the liberal group are an increasingly common sight during military-related Capitol Hill hearings, and they returned on Thursday to hassle former national security adviser and secretary of state Henry Kissinger (left), while his fellow former top diplomat George Shultz (right) watched . Sen. John McCain uncorked a tirade against CODE PINK activists who chanted 'Arrest Henry Kissinger for war crimes!' Calm: Kissinger, 91, remained in his chair throughout the protest, which saw handcuffs being waved at him . Intervention: As the angry group approached the front of the hearing to get close to Henry Kissinger, George Schultz got to his feet to remonstrate with them . Salute: George Schultz, 94, and Madeleine Albright, 77, both rose to their feet to applaud Henry Kissinger as the protesters were removed . Kissinger has long been accused by liberals of presiding over war crimes in Cambodia and Laos during the Vietnam War. He presided over America's withdrawal from the conflict and won the Nobel peace Prize for his efforts. McCain became visibly angry on Thursday when police weren't on the scene immediately to remove the protesters from the hearing chamber. 'Could I ask our Capitol Police to help instill order here? You know, someone find out where the Capitol Police is?' he asked from his spot on the dais. 'You know,' he told the group of pink-clad agitators, 'you're going to have to shut up, or I'm going to have you arrested.' One man, being escorted from the room by a uniformed cop, shouted something back at the senator. 'Get out of here, you low-life scum,' McCain replied before the audience erupted in applause. McCain offered an apology to Kissinger for the distraction. 'I've been a member of this committee for many years, and I have never seen anything as disgraceful and outrageous and despicable as the last demonstration that just took place,' he said. 'ARREST HENRY KISSINGER FOR WAR CRIMES!': Part of the left's historical narrative casts Kissinger as a criminal for helping expand the Vietnam war to neighboring Cambodia and Laos . Young and angry: Two of the anti-Kissinger protesters who had their palms painted red to imply that the former secretary of state had blood on his hands for his actions in office . Capitol Police eventually removed the protesters and McCain apologized for the disurbance . Accusation: The Code Pink group campaigns against any military involvement overseas and says Henry Kissinger should be prosecuted for civilian deaths in Cambodia . Sitting protest: Some of the group stayed in their seats as the demonstration went on and displayed red hands . Power trio: Henry Kissinger, George Schultz and Madeleine Albright were asked in front of the committee to give their views as former secretaries of state . 'From all of my colleagues ... I'd like to apologize for allowing such disgraceful behavior towards a man who served his country with the greatest distinction. I apologize profusely.' When Kissinger began to speak, the remaining protesters erupted a second time. His fellow former secretary of state George Schultz, who also testified, stood to salute him as more applause ensued – which drowned out the CodePink members. 'I salute Henry Kissinger for his many contributions to peace and security,' Shultz said. McCain praised Kissinger as someone 'who served his country with the greatest distinction.' The group, Code Pink, claims to be an organization for women to oppose 'the global militarism'. It claims it is 'rooted in a network of local organizers, online supporters and generous donors, with an emphasis on joy and humor'. And it says: 'Our tactics include satire, street theater, creative visuals, civil resistance, and directly challenging powerful decision-makers in government and corporations. And of course, wearing pink.' Its next planned event is to protest at a screening of American Sniper in Hollywood. The movie has attracted criticism from anti-war activists over its portrayal of the conflict in Iraq, but been a huge box office hit. McCain said in a statement after the hearing: 'Code Pink's typical protest tactics include interrupting Congressional hearings with chanting and sign-holding, which while disruptive and improper, do not represent a threat to witnesses. 'What happened today was far different. As Dr. Kissinger entered the hearing room to take his seat, a group of Code Pink protesters rushed up to the witness table to confront him, waving handcuffs within inches of his head. 'Some senators were concerned enough for Dr. Kissinger's safety that they came down off the dais to support the witnesses. With no U.S. Capitol Police intervening, the episode went on for several minutes.' CodePink is embracing their latest nickname as delivered by Sen. John McCain on Thursday . Reactions on Twitter ranged from shock to awe, but many said they enjoyed watching McCain uncork his anger .","Arizona Republican was slamming CodePink activists for condemning the former secretary of state and shaking handcuffs in his face .

"Chilling surveillance footage shows a Florida State University graduate entering the school's library and starting a shooting spree - leaving one student paralyzed from the waist down and another critically injured. Gunman Myron May is seen calmly walking around the Stozier Library in Tallahassee on November 20 last year in a baseball cap with horrified students running from the library's entrance and staff cowering behind desks. The 31-year-old had already fired one shot at student Jason Derfuss, who was remarkably saved by a book he had stored in his backpack. May, who was said to have been suffering from mental health problems at the time, is seen walking over to a desk and firing at two staff members at point blank range. Minutes later May walked out and was shot dead by officers on the library steps. Scroll down for video .

Footage from another angle shows Scott hobbling through the entrance to the library holding the gunshot wound on his leg. A picture released after the shooting showed him holding his injured leg on the floor behind a tables. Minutes after the shots were fired, armed first responders were seen flooding the lobby and securing the scene. By this point May had been shot and killed on the steps of the library by waiting officers. A report filed by the Tallahassee Police department states police opened fire because he made a rotating motion towards them. It also revealed that he had a shotgun and more ammunition in his car. May left Farhan 'Ronny' Ahmed paralyzed from the waist down after shooting him three times. The 21-year-old was studying for his finals at the time when he was hit in the spine.

After the deadly shooting police unearthed journals and videos that showed May believed he was being targeted. A former girlfriend also believes that he had developed a severe mental disorder and was taking medication. May sent a Facebook message to nine former classmates before the shooting that he need help to 'expose' what was happening to him and was sending them packages. One was picked up by the FBI when it reached Texas. Officers believe they could contain recordings and notes made by May on a thumb drive. On his Facebook page, he often wrote biblical verses and made a number of references to Christianity.

"The pilots of a helium-filled balloon who have embarked on a daring flight across the Pacific Ocean have drawn closer to North America as they attempt to break two world records. Troy Bradley of Albuquerque and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia are expected to cross into North America sometime Thursday evening. The accomplished balloon pilots are on course to break a distance record that has stood for more than three decades. They're also looking to break the flight-duration record set in 1978. Scroll down for video . Flight: Troy Bradley of New Mexico and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia set off from Saga, Japan take off in their quest to pilot their helium-filled balloon from Japan to North America . However, they still have a way to go before completing the journey. During their voyage, they will cross over the Canadian Rockies and land somewhere in the northern U.S., possibly Montana or North Dakota, on Saturday morning. The last time that anyone crossed the Pacific Ocean in a gas balloon was in 1981. But to break the distance record, the balloonists need to exceed the current records by one percent to claim a new world record. That means they need to travel 5,260 miles to break the mark. Another important record is the duration of the flight, set in 1978 when Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson and Larry Newman made the first trans-Atlantic balloon flight. That record of 137 hours in the air in a traditional gas balloon is considered the 'holy grail' of ballooning achievements. The pilots on the current flight are at about 100 hours. Pilot: Bradley  and Tiukhtyaev will pilot their helium-filled balloon from Japan in a bid to  break a distance record of 5,208 miles (8,381 kilometers) If they get that far, the team will notify the National Aeronautics Association of its claim within seven days of landing. All the documentation will be forwarded to the Federation Aeronautique Internationale for consideration. The process can take weeks, but the team will have plenty of data to present since the balloon is outfitted with an array of monitors and other instruments. In a visible sign of the progress, the tracking monitors at mission control in Albuquerque switched to showing U.S. cities as the closest landmarks Wednesday. Record breaking: The pilots also want to break the flight-duration record of 137 hours set in 1978 when Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson and Larry Newman made the first trans-Atlantic balloon flight . 'That just made it very real that we're getting close,' team member Kim Vesely said. But not even the pilots know where they will land. It depends on the winds encountered along the way. The balloon's speed has slowed significantly, which is something forecasters had expected. The balloon, made up of a massive envelope and a specially-designed carbon fiber-composite capsule, is capable of staying aloft for as many as 10 days. The team says the very last task will be a safe landing since there's no certainty about where the balloon will touch down. A network of balloonists have been established across the U.S. and in southern Canada who can serve as chase crews, those who are on the ground to help with tethering the capsule and rounding up the balloon's envelope as it deflates. The volunteers are ready to travel within a 200-mile radius once the landing spot becomes clear.","The pilots of a helium-filled balloon have drawn closer to North America .

"Britain's youngest competitive bodybuilder has revealed that the secret to his muscular body is down to sibling rivalry. Cosmo Taylor, 15, from Inverness, Scotland, has competed in a major national competition and is more likely to be honing his abs in his local gym than gaming on his Playstation. But Cosmo's unusual passion for the sport is something that runs in the family with his sister and father providing healthy competition for the young athlete. Scroll down for video... Cosmo Taylor (right) is Britain's youngest competitive body builder and he says the secret to his honed body is stiff competition with his sister Bronwyn who is a prize-winning powerlifter . Bronwyn, 19, is a prize-winning powerlifter and Andrew, 47, is a bodybuilder. And while the brother and sister duo continually push each other to improve their personal bests, Cosmo admits that there is some bubbling sibling rivalry between the pair. 'I'm very competitive with Bronwyn.' says the 15-year-old. 'If she's going to do 12 reps on something, I'll do 15. It's a sibling thing.' At just 14 Cosmo took part in his first national competition in Aberdeen in November 2014 . As well as his sister providing plenty of stiff competition, Cosmo's father Andrew, left, is also a body builder . Andrew says that when the siblings visit the gym together they will often challenge one another . Their father says that although Bronwyn is lighter than Cosmo she is probably stronger and provides a fair amount of competition for her younger brother . Cosmo also admits that although his family offers him plenty of support their competitive streak can also become a nuisance. 'My dad and sister were a big inspiration, but sometimes my sister can be a big irritation.' And the rivalry has not escaped the attention of dad Andrew who says that he often sees the siblings go head to head while working out. The siblings with their mum Florence (centre) with the pair's daily diet which includes plenty of protein . 'Sometimes in the gym there can be a competitive edge to them, depending on who's working what particular exercise that night, and if they both happen to be working the same exercise, they will feed off each other.' He added that although Cosmo is heavier than his sister that does not stop her from providing some stiff competition for her younger brother. 'Bronwyn being that bit older, although she's a girl and lighter than Cosmo, she will often just reel Cosmo in,' he said. As a competitive family, their living room is littered with trophies from the family's achievements . 'She'll let him go so far, but then she pulls it right back because she's got a lot more experience than Cosmo. 'Pound for pound she's probably just as strong and in a lot of events she's still actually stronger than Cosmo, something that Cosmo finds difficult to accept at times. But that's just the way it is because Bronwyn does tend to catch everyone out with the way she looks.' Breakfast: Scrambled eggs and porridge oats . Mid-morning: Roast chicken and salad . Lunch: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with vegetables and brown rice . Dinner: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with salad and sweet potato . Andrew added that you shouldn't be fooled by Bronwyn's feminine looks. 'She's very slim, slender, tall, elegant, but you put weights on the ground and she will outlift most people, even Cosmo, and that's something he's got to live with for a little while.' Bronwyn, who competes at national and international powerlifting events, works for the family's removals business - and Cosmo is more than happy to lend a hand when he can. She says: 'Doing removals keeps me mobile but I wouldn't class it as training, it's a different type of strength but it allows me plenty of free hours to pursue my interests that I wouldn't have with a nine to five job.' Cosmo, who started training informally at the age of 11, competed in his first show, the Silver City Classic Bodybuilding in Aberdeen, in November 2014, and has plans to enter more competitions in the future. Cosmo says that he is enjoying all the attention his muscles receive at school . The siblings combines muscles come in handy for lending a hand in the family's removal business . But for now Cosmo says that he is enjoying the attention that his super-sized muscles bring him at school. 'Some people want to see my abs, see my arms, they think it's really cool. Some people even want me to be their personal trainer! 'I think it's quite funny, but they're always supportive, asking me if I've got any events coming up, there's a really good atmosphere.' And while some people have expressed concerns about Cosmo competing at such a young age, he is adamant that he is not putting himself at risk. 'I've been training for almost four years now and I've been injury free. If you're going to do something stupid, that's how you're going to injure yourself. It's the same with any sport.'","At 15 Cosmo Taylor is Britain's youngest competing bodybuilder .

"British women are officially the most overweight in Europe. A quarter are obese – so fat it threatens their health – according to alarming figures. This is a far higher proportion than in the other countries of Western Europe. Obesity levels in the UK are far worse than Germany, Italy and France . British men are doing almost as badly, with more than one in five classed as obese, according to the authoritative figures. Experts are especially concerned by the young age at which so many women here are developing serious weight problems. A disturbing 16 per cent of young women aged 18 to 24 are obese – up to 16 times higher than many other European countries where the rate is between 1 per cent and 3 per cent. Young men are doing better, around 6 per cent are obese, but a worrying one third of men aged 45-64 are obese in the UK. The deeply troubling figures are contained in a report from Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, which compares obesity levels in 19 countries from 2008/2009. Only the U.S. and Ireland, which are not included in the league table, have higher obesity rates in the developed world. The latest table shows that only the former Soviet states of Latvia and Estonia – where one in five women is obese – approach the UK’s unenviable league-topping figure of 23.9 per cent. Women in Malta are catching up fast with rates of 22 per cent. Fifteen per cent of women in Germany are obese, while they are slimmer still in France (12.7 per cent) and Italy (9.3 per cent). The report says it is ‘particularly . significant’ that a third of men in the UK are obese between the ages of . 45 and 64. Overall, 22 per cent of British men are obese – and twice as . many are overweight, say experts. Neville Rigby, director of policy and . public affairs at the International Obesity Forum, said the British led . the field in obesity – but in almost all developed countries two-thirds . of adults are overweight or obese. ‘Levels of fatness are increasing all . the time,’ he said. ‘They go from overweight to obesity and affect more . than 60 per cent of adults in most countries. ‘The recession is likely to make . things worse, as people find they cannot afford the expense of buying . healthier foods and fill up on fatty and sugary junk foods.’ The National Audit Office estimates . that obesity causes at least 30,000 deaths a year in the UK, through . conditions such as cancer, heart disease, strokes and diabetes. It is shown to shorten lifespan, with individuals carrying 4st extra in weight at risk of losing three years in life expectancy. The Body Mass Index measurement is . used to calculate whether an individual is a healthy weight or not. This . is calculated by dividing weight (in kilos) by the square of his or her . height (in metres). Under 18.5 is underweight, 18.5-25 is a . healthy weight, 25-29.5 is overweight, 30-35 is obese and over 35 is . very obese. It means, for instance, a 5ft 6in woman weighing 14st would . have a BMI of 30 and would be seen as obese. A 6ft man weighing 16st . also has a BMI of 30. The formula has been criticised . because it may penalise those who have a lot of muscle, said Mr Rigby, . but he added: ‘Everyone knows when it’s fat.’ The report follows estimates made . earlier this year in The Lancet medical journal which found that if . current trends continue, the size of the obese population in the UK will . increase by 11million over the next two decades – up from 15million at . present. By 2030 the problem will trigger a startling number of illnesses. There will be almost half a million . more cases of heart disease and there will be around 700,000 extra cases . of diabetes, with 130,000 more developing cancer as a consequence of . their weight. Experts blame abundant energy-dense . food, too little exercise and lack of will by policymakers to curb . over-consumption. The Eurostat report links obesity with levels of . education, saying that the better educated tend to be . slimmer. Percentage of population classed as clinically obese: . Figures were not available for Denmark, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Finland and Sweden . Experts have been calling for ‘fat’ taxes on unhealthy food and a ban on advertisements aimed at children. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum campaign group, said education was key to fighting obesity. ‘Until the UK puts domestic science . properly back into the school curriculum, many women will continue to . rely on cheap, ready meals and fast, processed foods for their families . and themselves,’ he added.","Obesity levels far worse than Germany, Italy and France .

"The CIA officer credited with saving Hamid Karzai's life during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 has been named director of the National Clandestine Service, the agency's spying arm. The officer, a former Marine who is under cover and whose first name is Greg, was recently the head of the Special Activities Division, the CIA's elite paramilitary force. He has twice been station chief in Afghanistan, where in December 2001 he jumped to shield Karzai when the U.S. military accidentally bombed the position of the man who would become Afghanistan's president.  He earned Karzai's trust, and the Obama administration asked him to troubleshoot the fraught relationship with the Afghan leader in 2012, when he again served as station chief in Kabul. The CIA confirmed that a new top spy had been chosen but declined to name him. Current and former officials identified him on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose his name. The AP generally does not name covert intelligence officers unless there is a compelling reason. Blocked: In December 2001, the officer jumped to shield Hamid Karzai when the U.S. military accidentally bombed the position of the man who would become Afghanistan's president. Karzai is seen here in a December 2001 file photo . He was identified in the 2007 memoir of former CIA Director George Tenet as 'Greg V.' According to Tenet, he identified Karzai as the only credible Taliban opponent from Afghanistan's southern region and urged that he be protected. The new chief replaces Frank Archibald, who abruptly resigned as director of the clandestine service earlier this month after telling colleagues he opposed a major reorganization of the CIA being contemplated by Director John Brennan.  Archibald is retiring from the CIA. One idea under consideration by Brennan would break down the walls between the agency's spying and analysis arms, combining operations officers and analysts in 'centers' devoted to specific subjects.  The centers would be modeled after the Counter Terrorism Center, which oversees the drone killing program and is seen as one of the few success stories in what has been a difficult decade for American 'HUMINT,' or human intelligence.  Such centers could focus on cyber warfare, China, or other subjects that now fall under multiple disparate elements of the sprawling spy agency. 'The former Director of NCS announced last week that he planned to retire from the agency after a long and distinguished career at CIA,' CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said in a statement. 'We thank him for his profound and lasting contributions to both CIA and to our nation.' Trapani described the new director as 'one of CIA's most gifted and versatile leaders,' who has 'developed a remarkable range of expertise throughout his career and a keen understanding of what it takes to run effective operations, even in the most difficult conditions.' The new director supports Brennan's proposed re-organization, say former CIA officials who know him well.

"Twice as many state secondary schools are now considered to be underperforming compared with last year after a crackdown on the exams system. League tables, published yesterday, show 330 schools fell below the Government’s ‘floor target’ for GCSE results in 2014, up from 154 in 2013. In those schools, fewer than 40 per cent of pupils gained at least five C grades at GCSE, including English and maths. Pupils were also judged to have made poor progress in these two subjects. Scroll down for video . Eton (pictured) Harrow and Marlborough failed to get a single pupil to attain the Government's benchmark of five GCSEs at grades A*-C, including maths and English . Schools that fall below the threshold – the Government’s minimum acceptable standard – could face action, including being closed down and turned into an academy, or being taken over by a new sponsor. The increase is because of new Government rules which ban schools from including results from re-sits and poor-quality vocational courses. They remove the incentive for schools to encourage students to re-sit exams and study easier subjects. The league tables are based on data provided by the Department for Education and show how every school and college in England performed at GCSE, A-level and other academic and vocational qualifications in 2014. The number of pupils entering the English Baccalaureate rose by 71 per cent compared with four years before, meaning that there are now 89,874 more youngsters taking it than in 2010. Britain's top private schools have plummeted to the bottom of the league tables because of new rules governing which qualifications count. Around 335 schools – including Eton, Harrow and Winchester – registered 0 per cent for the proportion of pupils gaining at least five C grades at GCSE including English and maths. Under the shake-up, some English GCSEs and some international GCSEs do not count in the rankings. Many private schools favour IGCSEs, saying they are more rigorous. The Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents 270 independent schools, said the decision to drop IGCSEs means the tables ‘have become a nonsense’. A DfE spokesman said: ‘We have stripped out qualifications that were of little value.’ More than 300 schools fell beneath the Government's minimum target  to ensure that enough pupils get five good GCSEs following former Education Secretary Michael Gove's reforms . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said some schools appear to have been 'caught out' by the change in the way standards were measured . The EBacc is a performance measure of core academic subjects that recognises students who achieve at least a C at GCSE in English, maths, two sciences, history or geography and a language. The changes to the exam criteria were criticised by the National Association of Head Teachers, which said they had ‘tripped up’ secondary schools. General secretary Russell Hobby said: ‘Many of these changes disproportionately affected schools working with the most disadvantaged students. ‘It is now time for the Government to stop interfering in examinations on ministerial whim and let schools focus on teaching.’ But David Cameron told LBC Radio: ‘What we’ve done as a government is we’ve been more intolerant of failure in schools, and we’ve raised the bar. ‘That’s why the figures do show some results that are disappointing, because we’re being frank and saying look, let’s not hide problems, let’s identify schools that are not working properly and let’s turn them around.’ Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘For too long pupils were offered courses of no value to them and schools felt pressured to enter young people for exams before they were ready.’ Sixth-formers are now studying more A-levels in rigorous subjects favoured by leading universities. In what will be seen as a vindication for Michael Gove, an increasing number of pupils appear to be shunning softer choices for ‘facilitating subjects’. These subjects, which are required most often by Russell Group universities, include English literature, maths, physics, biology, chemistry, geography, history and languages. Figures from the Department for Education show that overall there were 407,600 A-level entries in these subjects in 2014, up 20,000 compared with four years before. The figures also indicate a rise in the number of students – particularly girls – studying maths and the sciences. There were just over 79,000 entries for maths last year, up 9,000 compared with 2010. Among girls alone, 6,423 took physics A-level last year, up from 5,689 in 2010, while the percentage of teenage girls taking maths was up 7.3 per cent on 2010. The results come after a drive to encourage state school pupils to study more rigorous subjects, which was led by Mr Gove when he was education secretary. Addressing his critics while still in post, he said: ‘Academic rigour is liberating, not limiting. Students with good passes, especially in traditional subjects, have more opportunities in life.’","League tables show 330 schools have fallen below Government targets .

"What did the humans enjoy drinking  - and use to get merry - 9,000 years ago? That’s the question an ‘alcohol archaeologist’ has been attempting to answer, by tracing back some of the world’s most ancient brews. By analysing the residues found on fragments of pottery and studying references in texts, he has managed to recreate a number of ancient beers and wines that were all but lost to history. Dr Patrick McGovern from the University of Pennsylvania Museum has been creating ancient alcoholic drinks. He collects residues from containers to recreate the drinks. The oldest he has made so far dates back 9,000 years in China, while another called Midas Touch (shown) is believed to have been drunk by King Midas himself . The beverages were brewed by Dogfish Head Brewery in Delaware, who worked with Dr Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. To reveal what ingredients were needed, Dr McGovern analysed residues found at various archaeological sites around the world. He detected traces of various ingredients left by the drinks - including barley, honey, herbs and spices - using a number of methods including liquid chromatography, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The first drink that he recreated is named the Midas Touch, and is based on molecular evidence from residues found inside a Turkish tomb, believed to have belonged to King Midas, dating back to 700 BC. A variety of alcoholic residues have been found inside important tombs around the world - suggesting that they were drinks used during celebrations or rituals and perhaps even to wish good luck to the dead in the afterlife. The sweet and dry Midas Touch beer is made using honey, barley malt, white muscat grapes and saffron. The oldest beer that Dr McGovern brewed is entitled Chateau Jiahu, the ingredients for which were discovered inside a 9,000-year-old tomb in China. Midas Touch . Somewhere between beer, wine and mead, this drink is based on molecular evidence found in a Turkish tomb believed to have belonged to King Midas, dating back to 700 BC. It’s a sweet yet dry beer made with honey, barley malt, white muscat grapes and saffron. Chateau Jiahu . This 9,000-year-old Chinese drink is made with hawthorn fruit, Chinese wild grapes, rice and honey. It is the oldest known fermented beverage in history. Theobroma . Found in Honduras, Theobrama is brewed with artisanal dark chocolate from the ancient cacao area of Soconusco, honey, chilies, corn and annatto or achiote (fragrant and reddish, imitating sacrificial blood). It dates back 3,400 years, based on chemical analysis of pottery fragments found in Honduras which contained the earliest chocolate beverage from the Americas.. Ta Henket . The ingredients of this drink are based on chemical and botanical analyses of Egypt's oldest known wine (about 3150 BC) and other sites dating back 18,000 years, in addition to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions and artistic depictions of brewing. It uses an ancient species of wheat (einkorn) for hearth-baked bread, with added chamomile, doum palm fruit and Middle Eastern herbs. Birra Etrusca Bronze . This 2,800-year-old drink uses two-row malted barley and an heirloom Italian wheat. It heralds from Italy and also contains speciality ingredients such as hazelnuts, pomegranates, Italian chestnut honey and wildflower and clover honeys from Delaware, and myrrh. The Dogfish version was brewed with bronze (replicating the ancient vessels made of this metal alloy); the Italian versions were brewed in replica Etruscan pottery jars and oak barrels. Kvasir . Chemical, botanical and pollen evidence are the basis for this 'Nordic grog,' which is attested at sites in Sweden and Denmark from the Bronze Age to Roman times. The contents of a 3,500-year-old Danish drinking vessel exemplifies this drink. The vessel was made of birch bark and found in the tomb of a leather and woollen-clad woman, who was possibly a priestess. The ingredients are sourced from the far north: red winter wheat, lingonberries, cranberries, bog myrtle (Myrica gale), yarrow, honey, juniper, and birch syrup. Imported wine from southern and central Europe was also added to the bracing northern brew. It is made using hawthorn fruit, Chinese wild grapes, rice and honey, and is the oldest known fermented beverage in history - older even than wine. While most simply involve the mixing of ingredients for fermentation, others required slightly more bizarre production methods. For example, to make Chateau Jiahu, corn must be milled and moistened in the maker’s mouth to convert starches in the corn into fermentable sugars - before it is ‘spat’ into the beer. ‘All the drinks are centred around natural products of the regions,’ Dr McGovern told MailOnline. ‘These drinks represent speciality upper class beverages, used in kinds of ceremonies, religious rites festivals. 'But in some places and periods, such as the more democratised Neolithic, the general populace seem to have enjoyed them, too.' White muscat grapes, stock image pictured, are used in the creation of the Midas Touch drink - along with honey, barley malt and saffron - to create a sweet yet dry beer . Dr McGovern is pictured left, with Sam Calagione from Dogfish, in the process of making one of the ancient drinks. Shown right is a birch-bark bucket found in Denmark, which archaeobotanical evidence revealed to contain 'Nordic grog' dating back up to 1,500 years . The oldest drink made by Dr McGovern and Dogfish is Chateau Jiahu (shown), the ingredients for which were found in a 9,000-year-old tomb in China. It is made from hawthorn fruit, Chinese wild grapes, rice and honey, and is the oldest known fermented beverage in history - older even than wine . Dr McGovern likens them to expensive cocktails today. In particular, in northern Europe it was not possible to make wine, so it had to be imported from central or southern Europe, making it an expensive beverage. ‘You had a great deal of social elite value to it,’ he said. ‘Just like today, you serve a fancy bottle of wine, but only certain [people] can afford it to impress the neighbours, it was the same thing in antiquity.’ With regards to finding the recipes to make the drinks, Dr McGovern has scoured texts to find out the various ingredients. But he also gathers residues from certain ancient containers. ‘Sometimes I’m just fortunate [in finding them], sometimes it took me on a grand tour,’ he said. The residues aren’t always visible, though; most get absorbed into pottery, and must be extracted in a complicated process using solvents. The drink called Ta Henket relied on ingredients from Egyptian hieroglyphics. It uses an ancient species of wheat for hearth-baked bread, with added chamomile, doum palm fruit (shown) and Middle Eastern herbs . Pictured is an ancient Roman imported drinking-set, comprised of a bucket (situla), a ladle and strainer-cup nested together, and several 'sauce pans' or drinking cups, from a hoard under the floor of a settlement at Havor, Sweden in the southern part of the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea, from the first century AD . A young blond woman, believed to be a priestess, was buried in an oak trunk coffin under a mound at Egtved in Jutland, Denmark between 1500 and 1300 BC. She was found with the birch-bark bucket pictured earlier. Wrapped in a cow hide, she wears a dancer’s tasseled dress with a large bronze bronze disk . A 30-year-old woman was laid to rest in a wood coffin at Juellinge, Denmark around 200 BC, shown. Together with cosmetic items and jewelry, the woman held a long-handled bronze strainer-cup in her right hand, part of an imported Roman wine-set, including a bucket, ladle and incised glass beaker behind her head . Dr McGovern said his favourite is Chateau Jiahu, the oldest of the lot he has made, dating back 9,000 years. ‘That’s the one that I identify with most,’ he said. 'It goes well with Asian food, it has a sweet and sour profile.' Based on botanical evidence, Dr McGovern believes there may be an even older Egyptian drink from 16,000 BC that could be made, and that it is likely humans have been making alcoholic drinks for much, much longer. ‘All animals are attracted to sugar and alcohol: insects, fruit fly, elephants,’ he said. ‘Humans would have known how to make an alcoholic beverage right from the beginning.’","Dr Patrick McGovern from the University of Pennsylvania Museum has been creating ancient alcoholic drinks .

"A police officer has been jailed for 15 months after he stalked a string of girls and young women and sent one naked pictures of himself. Special constable Ryan Reid, 27, wept and shouted 'I love you mum' as he was sentenced to prison at Lanark Sheriff Court today. He terrorised his victims - one as young as 15 - by turning up at their homes and workplaces, as well as inundating them with sexual messages on Facebook . Reid also used his position with the police to access confidential data about other people and share it with his friends. Jailed: Ryan Reid has been sentenced to 15 months in prison for stalking multiple young women . The defendant, from Lesmahagow in Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty to seven charges involving five different women. Sheriff Nikola Stewart ordered that Reid be put on the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years and banned from approaching two of his victims in addition to his prison sentence. He admitted two charges of stalking women, three under the Communications Act and one under the Sexual Offences Act, as well as one offence under the Data Protection Act. Reid carried out the offences between 2010 and 2013 - in one case, he repeatedly turned up at the petrol station where his victim was working alone. He loitered outside the home of another young women, as well as approaching her outside a pub sending her online messages over a six-month period. After he was charged, Reid wrote on Facebook that he was only trying to be a 'nice guy' and claimed to be the victim of sex discimination. He wrote: 'I am willing to explain things to people if they ask me. 'If anyone has formed an opinion of me without actually speaking to me about things fair enough that's their problem, and if you don't want me on your Facebook anymore just f***ing delete me. Too hard to be a nice guy any more.' Weeping: Reid cried in court and shouted 'I love you mum' after he was jailed today . He added: 'Every time a woman drops their trousers - promotion. Every time a man drops theirs - disciplinary action. Where's the equality in that?' Joseph Cahill QC, defending, said in court: 'He fully accepts he did commit these things and he has full responsibility for them. 'I can tell you that he is sitting there terrified about the possibility of a custodial sentence. 'In respect to messages sent on Facebook, he says that at the time of sending them he was unaware of the impact these were having on the complainers. 'He misread the situation he was in, he was suffering mental health issues and was drinking but that is not an excuse.' Jailing Reid, Ms Stewart said: 'The most distressing aspect of this is that he is a police officer and made it known to his victims. He was interested in grooming young girls. 'These numerous offences all displayed a course of criminal conduct which was intended for your sexual gratification and you were willing to cloud yourself with the status and office your position gave to you. No 15-year-old would report a serving police officer. 'This is not just a case about you letting down your uniform by your actions. I have listened to everything that has been said on your behalf but there is no alternative to custody in this case.'","Ryan Reid, 27, turned up at the homes and offices of five young women .

"Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned that the new Cold War will become a 'hot' armed conflict between Moscow and the West if the EU expands sanctions against Russia. The EU is preparing to impose further sanctions against Russia as Ukraine's warring parties announced fresh truce talks after a surge in fighting between Kiev and Kremlin-backed rebels today. Pro-Russian militants pulled out of peace talks last week and announced a new offensive that was followed by a rocket attack on the strategic port of Mariupol, southeastern Ukraine, in which 31 civilians died. Scroll down for video . Former Preisdent of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, pictured in Berlin last November, has warned that further sanctions threaten to spiral the new Cold War into open conflict with global repercussions . Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, appeared to pin the blame on the West for the worsening situation. He said the sanctions, which had cut Russian access to US and European capital markets, threatened to spiral into open warfare with global repercussions. 'Where will that lead all of us? A Cold War is already being waged openly. What's next?' the 83-year-old Nobel peace prize winner said. 'Unfortunately I cannot say for sure that a Cold War will not lead to a 'hot' one.' The West says Russian forces are in Ukraine supporting the rebels, a charge the Kremlin denies, and has urged Moscow repeatedly to respect the terms of a peace deal signed in the Belarussian capital Minsk in September. In a new development, the contact group of representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE will hold further peace talks in Minsk on Friday, the Belarus foreign ministry said. Ukraine's western-backed President Petro Poroshenko had earlier called for urgent talks in Minsk, saying they should lead to an 'an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact.' Washington and its European allies believe Russian President Vladimir Putin backs the rebels in revenge for last year's ousting of Kiev's former Kremlin-backed government. Workers try to repair the city of Mariupol, southeatern Ukraine, where rebel shelling killed at least 30 people . The rebels have made good their threat to push into the important eastern industrial lands that still answer to Kiev, with fears that they could open up a land corridor linking Russia to the annexed Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. Poroshenko's office said US Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday 'expressed his firm support for the Ukrainian president's actions and spelled out the possibility of expanding sanctions against Russia in case of a further escalation.' Western sanctions combined with a slump in oil prices have plunged Russia into recession and seen Standard and Poor's slap a 'junk' rating on Moscow's debt. During talks in Brussels, EU foreign ministers looked set to overcome opposition from Greece's new radical government and add to a blacklist of individuals who face travel bans and asset freezes over the conflict. 'We are going to reinforce the sanctions that target the separatists and those who support them, including in Russia,' France's European affairs minister Harlem Desir told reporters. The bombing of Mariupol (pictured) is the latest attack since fighting sparked up again in Ukraine . European Union leaders ordered ministers to discuss new sanctions after fresh fighting in the key port city of Mariupol that threatened to turn the nine-month conflict in eastern Ukraine into all-out war. Ministers may recommend extending through to September sanctions initially imposed on Russian and Ukraine figures after Moscow annexed Crimea in March 2014, according to a draft document seen by AFP. They could also examine the possibility of widening much tougher sectoral measures hurting the Russian economy which were introduced after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July. Greece's new government has so far refused to go along, reviving fears that the closeness of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's Syriza party to Russia could lead it to block further measures. EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said she would 'work to keep our unity and exercise the maximum of pressure to stop the fighting and to reach a ceasefire.' Kiev and local officials said six civilians and five Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the last 24 hours, adding to the UN's confirmed death toll of 5,100 for the conflict in the former Soviet state.","Mikhail Gorbachev said sanctions threatened to spiral into open warfare .
