"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . An overweight blogger has documented her amazing body transformation after dropping four stone - in just 100 days. Sophie King, 26, gave up on sport and fitness after suffering a series of illnesses and watched her weight balloon to 14 stone. But the primary school teacher created a unique plan to guarantee that she slimmed down in exactly 100 days. Sophie, from Newquay, Cornwall, shunned supplements and diet pills and decided to stick with a healthy balanced meals combined with daily exercise. Scroll down for video . Sophie put on several stone (left) after several illnesses, including a broken ankle, an abscess and glandular fever. But after 100 days she slimmed down dramatically to a size 10 (right.) But more than three months, she also meticulously charted her journey on her blog, posting photos of her meals and activities while attracting an incredible 10,000 followers. And at the end of her '100 Healthy Days' challenge - her version of the '100 Happy Days' internet craze - she stripped off to reveal her bikini body and amazing four stone weight loss. Sophie was a healthy body shape when she lived in Cheshire in her teens but gave up sports after breaking her ankle when she was 17. She went on to graduate from Durham University but suffered a bout of glandular fever and was later in and out of hospital battling a painful leg abscess for nine months. At her heaviest she weighed 14 stone. Sophie said: 'I broke my ankle at 17 and had pins put in it. I used to play sport but after that I couldn't and that was the start of me putting on weight. Sophie King documented the healthy meals she was eating on her blog for 100 days during her weight loss . 'When I got to university I was really unhealthy and ended up with glandular fever. 'Then nine months of hell with the abscess was a bit of a wake up call. 'I moved to Cornwall because I wanted to be somewhere I can enjoy the outdoors and to be fitter and healthier. 'I have been much more conscious of my health and this challenge has been a way to share it with other people. Sophie also posted snaps of her daily exercise in the Cornish countryside . 'Over the past 100 days so much has changed, it might not sounds like a long time but there is so much you can do in 100 days. 'I feel fitter, healthier and so much more confident.' Despite finishing her 100 Healthy Days challenge, Sophie has decided keep up with her blog because of the requests and messages she gets from her thousands of followers. She has also begun using her new-found love of fitness to raise funds for the RNLI by taking part in the Big Swim Cornwall and Castle2Castle swim. Sophie added: 'The blog was all about sharing everything about diet and fitness, so the next step is going to be more along the lines of well-being, healthy mind and healthy spirit. Sophie King managed to lose four stone in 100 days, going from 14 stone (left) to 10 stone (right) 'I've had so many people say that they don't want me to stop, so I don't feel like I should stop. I've had so much lovely feedback. 'There is the danger with exercise that it can become addictive, so the blog will be about how to balance exercise with a happy life. 'When I moved to Cornwall, swimming in the sea was a particular fear of mine, but setting challenges has helped me overcome that and I now swim in the sea regularly. 'I haven't run in 10 years and I went on a treadmill to see what would happen and managed to do 10k no problem. 'So now I'm attempting a triathlon - a whole new world has opened up in front of me. 'It's all about taking a small step every day - at the end of 100 days it adds up to a whole new you.'","Sophie King, 26, gave up fitness after suffering from glandular fever .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A Chinese street food seller and father-of-one was executed today in China, despite a backlash from thousands of people. Xia Junfeng's death sentence was carried out today, despite two appeals, after the man was convicted of murdering two officials who were stopping him from trading. After losing his job at a government-run factory, Xia had taken to grilling kebabs and sausages on a street in Shengyang, north-eastern China. Executed: Xia Junfeng, pictured here in court, was executed in China today . He was found guilty of the murders by Shenyang Intermediate People's Court, which dismissed claims that he had acted in self-defence after heavy-handed officials repeatedly beat him. A group of 25 human rights lawyers in China objected to the punishment, saying that the case was too uncertain and that the Chinese Supreme Court should have stopped the sentence. It said: 'We protest that the Supreme Court ratified the death sentence and ordered an immediate execution in a case where doubts remain.' Family: Xia is here pictured with his son, now 12, and his wife Zhang Jing . Emotive: The couple's son has painted pictures showing his parents, which have been disseminated over the internet . Xia's wife Zhang Jing led a vocal protest against her husband's punishment, including a failed appeal to the Chinese supreme court. Images painted by their 12-year-old son showing cartoon versions of himself and his father together were widely shared in social media posts protesting his innocence. Today Zhang said :'I swear I will not cry again, so that my dear man can go in peace.' Distraught: Zhang Jing, pictured, posted of her resolve when she heard the news about her husband . Xia stabbed the two officials - known as chengguan - in May 2009 after he was taken into a room by the men, whose job it is to regulate street traders. His business did not have a licence. He claimed that the chengguan - who are known for being heavy-handed in their work - provoked him to the attack by beating him on the street. But the court threw out the claim and convicted him of murder, saying it could see no evidence that he was beaten. Death sentences in China must all be approved by the Supreme Court, but a passionate appeal by his family, which argued that there are still too many unanswered questions in the case, was quashed. A statement released today by the Shenyang court which convicted Xia said that the Supreme Court approving the death penalty was proof they considered his crime 'vile' and 'extremely cruel'. However, the move provoked a huge backlash, leading to Xia's name being the most-searched topic on Chinese social media site Weibo today. Those who disagree with the harsh sentence have contrasted Xia's case with that of Gu Kailai, the wife of prominent politican Bo Xilai, who was last week sentenced to prison for corruption. Contrast: Politician's wife Gu Kailai pleaded guilty to murder, but was given a suspended sentence . Gu pleaded guilty last year to the murder of Neil Heywood, a British businessman with whom she said a commercial disagreement. Despite admitting that her murder was premeditated, it is likely Gu's death sentence will be reduced to life in prison. Yao Bo, a prominent commentator in China, said: 'I am no legal expert, but I know a simple rule: If Gu Kailai can be spared of her life for a premeditated murder, then Xia Junfeng should not die.' Author Yi Chen declared 'justice is dead' in response to the punishment, adding: 'His life and death are more than just a legal matter, but a bellwether of the era, with the tsunami-like public opinion firmly on the side of Xia Junfeng'. Legal experts have pointed to holes in the prosecution's case, including contradictory statements and a lack of credible witnesses. Wang Jianxun, a professor at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, said the outcome amounted to 'legal regression.' 'The legal system clearly has taken the side of the urban management,' Wang said. ‘This is an unjust verdict.'","Xia Junfeng was executed today despite protests and calls for leniency .

"By . Emily Crane . and Candace Sutton for Daily Mail Australia . The Christian missionary who allegedly tried to wrestle the controls from a young pilot mid-air has been charged after the plane was forced to make an emergency landing. Les Nixon, 82, was arrested when he was released from hospital late on Wednesday after a 23-year-old pilot was forced to subdue him when he allegedly grabbed the controls of the four-seater Duchess light aircraft as they were flying over the Blue Mountains in NSW on Monday. Pilot James Chandler told police Mr Nixon started switching off fuel lines and pushing control buttons, forcing an emergency landing near Oberon, west of the Blue Mountains. Following a police investigation, Mr Nixon, from Georges Hall in Sydney's south-west, was charged with prejudicing the safe operation of an aircraft. Scroll down for video . Pilot James Chandler, 23, had to make an emergency landing after an 82-year-old passenger allegedly switched off the fuel lines over the Blue Mountains in NSW on Monday . Les Nixon, pictured here with his wife Martha, was a Christian missionary with more than 50 years of flying experience. He was charged by police late on Wednesday following an investigation . Mr Nixon's friend of 40 years, Phil Lamb, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that his erractic behaviour was totally out of character and could offer no explanation why he would allegedly try and ditch the plane. 'I can't even imagine what would have happened in that plane. It certainly comes as a surprise,' Mr Lamb said. 'It would have been very out of character for him to do anything that wasn't professional.' Mr Nixon has been flying for 50 years to isolated corners of Australia as part of the Christian outreach program he started with his wife Martha, Australia's Outback Patrol. 'That Duchess he flew was his favourite plane. He knew that Duchess (plane) inside and out,' Mr Lamb said. 'He used to hire a twin engine out of Bankstown to maintain currency so that means he would have been familiar with every switch inside,' Mr Lamb said. A dramatic recording of the cockpit emergency revealed audio of the pilot struggling with Mr Nixon in the light plane as they flew over the Blue Mountains. 'Pan pan pan pan pan, bravo foxtrot papa, bravo foxtrot papa, my passenger is trying to take over,' Mr Chandler shouts into the aircraft's speaker, according to an Air Traffic Control recording obtained by the Nine Network. Mr Nixon, the sole passenger on the flight, had allegedly reached over to switch off the fuel supply to the plane's single engine and then tried to take control of the joystick, causing Mr Chandler to shout 'We... whoah, whoah. My passenger's taking... the engines.' A dramatic recording of the cockpit emergency revealed audio of the pilot struggling with Mr Nixon in the light plane as they flew over the Blue Mountains . Mr Chandler punched Mr Nixon repeatedly in the face to subdue him, breaking the 82-year-old's nose . Mr Nixon had chartered the flight - allegedly his first on a light plane - from Australian By Air to take him from the NSW Central Coast over the Blue Mountains to Cowra, 350km to the south-west. Mr Chandler punched Mr Nixon repeatedly in the face to subdue him, breaking the 82-year-old's nose. At the same time the pilot - who has just two years' flying experience - managed to shut off the craft's mechanics and glide it down at about 3pm on Monday into a flat paddock run with sheep on a property known as Bloomfield, near Oberon. Mr Lamb said he couldn't comment on his friend's health during the mid-air incident. 'He’s getting medical assessments and I guess when those are available, more will be discovered of his physical condition,' he said. 'Obviously, there’s speculation about what’s happened. But unless someone else was on board, it’s impossible for us to understand. 'There’s two sides to the story. There’s a young pilot who is relatively inexperienced and a pilot who has been flying for 50 years. Whether there has been a miscommunication, I guess that will be revealed in investigation.' Mr Nixon, 82, is recovering in hospital after the pilot was forced to subdue him when he allegedly grabbed the controls of the four-seater Duchess light aircraft in which they were airborne . Pilot James Chandler safely landed in a sheep paddock at Oberon, west of the Blue Mountains, where a Royal Australian Navy helicopter was first on the scene to come to his aid . 'The pilot's done really well to land the plane safely,' a NSW police officer told Daily Mail Australia. 'With this bloke fiddling with the controls. It could have been much worse, a real disaster.' Australia By Air CEO, David Trevelyan, who said the elderly man was a first time customer with his company, told Nine News Mr Chandler's flying skills were paramount in avoiding a crash. 'I would like to praise the actions of the pilot. He showed fantastic skill,' Mr Trevelyan said. 'He did an excellent job in an amazingly difficult scenario ... and under tremendous pressure.' Mr Chandler was treated briefly in hospital before being released. Mr Nixon had headed the Australia's Outback Patrol program with his wife Martha since 1961. 'He was a lovely, fine man. He has had a 50 years long carer serving other people. He started a mission whose aim was to use the plane in isolated communities,' Mr Lamb said.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . The screams of 13-year-old Nicholas Dillon could be heard throughout his pitch black house when the earth shook and the falling bricks hit him. His mother, who later called it the worst night of her life, could not get to him. 'I should be dead,' said Nicholas, whose pelvis was broken in several places when part of a chimney collapsed on him in the magnitude-6.0 earthquake that struck Napa in California wine country. 'I thought I was paralysed,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle from his hospital bed. 'I couldn't feel my legs. I couldn't feel my back.' Scroll down for video . 'Worst night of my life': 13-year-old Nicholas Dillon's mother was devastated when she couldn't help her son . Nicholas was having a sleepover with a friend, who was not hurt, and had pulled a mattress into the living room to sleep. At 3.20am on Sunday, the shaking started. 'I felt the first jolt of the earthquake and I spun around and yelled my friend's name four times,' Nicholas said. 'The chimney collapsed on my back and I stumbled a little forward on the floor. I was lying there. I was screaming my mom's name and she fell twice trying to get to me.' His mother, Catalina Dillon, said she was petrified. 'It was the worst night of my life,' she said. 'When I heard him screaming and yelling and I couldn't reach him and couldn't see where he was. I was so scared.' 'I should be dead': Nicholas had a lucky escape when a chimney collapsed on him during the earthquake . Nicholas said he thinks he escaped greater injury or death because he tried scooting toward the door when the shaking started. 'If I hadn't moved, I'm telling you, I shouldn't be here right now,' he said. 'I didn't black out. I remember the whole thing.' With phones out, his grandfather ran to a fire station and paramedics eventually came to take him to a local hospital before he was flown to University of California, Davis Children's Hospital, where he underwent nearly ten hours of surgery. He is now listed in fair condition, and doctors say it will be five to six months before he can put weight on his legs, though as a keen footballer, his goal is to walk in four. The friend who was staying with Nicholas, Imanol Villanueva, had been given the sofa to sleep on. He told NBC Bay Area: 'All I remember was he started yelling my name and then I yelled his and I saw the bricks coming down on him.' His mother said the family lost its home during the recent recession and was worried about how they would pay his medical bills. But Nicholas said he will try to stay optimistic. 'I'm still a little scared,' he said. 'I really don't know what to expect. Either way I will stay on top of things. I'm not going to worry about it because it's not going to help me out if I start being negative and start worrying about it. I'm not going to let it get to me. I'm just not.' The earthquake injured more than 100 people - three seriously, including Nicholas - but no one was killed. It was the biggest in the region for 25 years, and left historic buildings and homes in the town of Napa, north of San Francisco damaged, and caused power cuts and water outages.","Nicholas Dillon, 13, had his pelvis crushed by a chimney during earthquake .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A 7ft criminal who escaped a jail sentence because he is too tall for prison beds has appeared in court for breaching his curfew. Jude Medcalf, 23, spent 75 days on remand earlier this year for stealing food and Christmas presents from an NHS office and firing a BB gun at a woman. But a judge at Exeter Crown Court ordered his release in March because he suffers from Klinefelter Syndrome, a growth disorder meaning he’s too big for standard prison beds and uniforms. Scroll down for video . Jude Medcalf, 23, who was released from jail earlier this year because he was too tall for the beds, has been back in court accused of breaching his curfew . Medcalf was instead given a 12-month community order and six-month curfew after he pleaded guilty to possession of an imitation firearm and a bladed article, criminal damage and burglary. But Medcalf - who is nicknamed Tiny - was back in court today after breaching his curfew. Medcalf, whose condition and means he is still growing and is only capable of adolescent emotions, was supposed to be at home between midnight to 6am every night. However the court heard Medcalf worked at a fairground and his bosses sometimes asked him to stay late without warning. His lawyer said he only breached his curfew because he was so desperate to keep his job. Judge Graham Cottle decided to lift the curfew six weeks early so Medcalf of Newton Abbot, Devon, could carry on working. The judge said: 'A curfew is designed to address a case where people are out committing crimes in the evening and it seems like Mr Medcalf isn’t. 'I’m going to remove this curfew as it is not serving it’s purpose.' Medcalf spent 75 days in custody earlier this year after he stole Christmas presents from an NHS office, took steak from a pub, and shot a BB gun at a woman . Video courtesy of Andrology Australia . Medcalf was arrested after he terrified an innocent woman by firing a BB gun at her, and then went on to steal £30 of Christmas presents and £20 tea money from an NHS office. He was later found with stolen food - including a large amount of rump steak, which was taken from The Sloop pub in Newton Abbot while it was open and staff were distracted. Sufferers of Klinefelter Syndrome,  often develop enlarged breasts, have sparse facial and body hair, small testes, and an inability to produce sperm. Men with the condition often grow to 6ft or 6ft 2in, but only of two men - including Medcalf - have grown to 7ft. Sufferers also tend to have gender issues because they have an extra 'X', or female, chromosome, and may also suffer skeletal problems.","Jude Medcalf released from jail because of growth disorder earlier this year .

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Revellers who urinate in public in the Czech Republic face being named and shamed around the world - after a businessman threatened to post their antics on YouTube. This picture, which was posted to Twitter and has quickly gone viral, shows men what they can expect if they decide to baptise the streets with their own holy water. Beneath the illustration of a stick man spraying the ground has been added an extra message in the universal language of pictograms - threatening to video-record the act and publish the clip on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Innovative: A sign in the universal language of pictograms issues an innovative threat to men who wee in public . Marek Sotak posted the image to Twitter last week after finding it on a Czech-language discussion forum, and it has been retweeted more than 5,000 times and chosen as a 'favourite' by more than 3,000 users. The sign is in Mikulov, a wine-making tourist town sitting on the southern border of the Czech Republic and Austria. The three-stage pictographic message presents a stark message to anyone thinking of relieving themselves away from designated (preferably plumbed-in) areas. Whip out the old fella and start to spray, it warns, and your act will be caught on closed-circuit television camera. This footage will then be taken and uploaded to YouTube for the world's amusement. Mr Sotak's Tweet suggests that the approach is typically Czech. He writes: 'In Czech Republic, this is how you threat people (sic), so they don't to bad things...' The innovative deterrent has caught the imagination of people across the world, with news websites from London to Boston reporting it and calling for the policy to be adopted in their own home towns. Beautiful: Marek Sotak says the sign was put up by an irate hotelier in Mikulov, pictured, Czech Republic . But responding to a Tweet from MailOnline, Mr Sotak admitted the initiative was not official public policy in Mikulov. Asked if the sign was genuine, he responded: 'Yes it is, but it is not the government who put that up, an upset hotel owner did.' iDNES.cz quotes Petr Marcinčák, the hotelier in question, as saying: 'If I wanted to, I could argue with someone every day [about peeing against his walls], so I came up with the warning.' No videos have yet emerged on YouTube of people peeing outside Hotel Marcinčák, But Mr Sotak added that he thought the hotelier was willing to carry through on the threat. 'I think the owner meant it. It was not a joke,' he said.","Sign is outside a hotel in a picturesque town near the border with Austria .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . This is the moment a frustrated man snapped - bringing the bloodied corpse of a dead male koala into the offices of his local council. Darren Mewett, from Thornlands, southeast of Brisbane, decided to take the gruesome stand because he was upset with how council has failed to protect local wildlife from becoming roadkill. He told local newspaper The Redland City Bulletin no one had addressed his concerns when he previously reported a koala fatality. 'This time, I decided to take the koala in to council because no action was taken the last time I reported a dead koala and my comments were not taken seriously,' Mr Mewett told the paper. Scroll down for video . He's had enough: Redland resident Darren Mewett stormed into his local council offices wielding a bloodied dead male koala. A concerned woman watches on as Mr Mewett waits patiently in the customer service queue at Redland City Council. Donned in workwear, Mr Mewett stormed into the council chamber holding the koala in his right hand. In he goes: Mr Mewett enters the Redland City Council building. 'This council operates under a fallacy, spruiking there are koalas here and they are protected but it is all just talk.' After storming into the offices, Mr Mewett stood patiently in the customer service queue alongside other local residents. Councillor Lance Hewlett, the local government's environment spokesman, told Daily Mail Australia many staff found the display over the top. 'It was quite confronting, I think, for some of the customer service staff,' he said. A council spokesman said it has had 'ongoing discussions' with Mr Mewett about his road safety concerns. Signs have been erected warning motorists of wildlife in the past. The spokesman said council will investigate if further action should be taken. Redland is part of the so-called 'Koala Coast' which includes the Moreton Bay Regional Council and Redland City Council areas. More than 1300 koalas are estimated to live in Redland, according to council figures released last year. That makes it one of the biggest urban koala populations in Australia. Mr Mewett brought the dead koala into the Redland City Council offices. Fellow locals appear unimpressed at Mr Mewett for his stunt.

"By . Sam Webb . As someone who's famous for her role as an indestructible cheerleader on TV sci-fi show Heroes, Hayden Panettiere may seem an odd choice to become a pro-democracy campaigner in a former Soviet state. But yesterday she addressed protestors in Kiev's Independence Square with her fiance, Ukrainian boxing champion Vladimir Klitschko.

He has successfully defended his title 11 times, most recently in September 2012, and plans to have one more bout before he retires. He still spends several hours a day training. Now Klitschko must prove that he has as much stamina in the political arena.","Heroes actress spoke to crowd and told them to 'keep fighting'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Last year Snapchat famously turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook - a decision that left many stunned considering the company was - and is - yet to make any serious revenue. But the move seems to have paid off, as Snapchat’s owners are set to become billionaires with reports that the company is now valued at £6 billion ($10 billion). In a recent round of funding, investors promised millions to the company in a move that sees the company jump significantly in value within less than a year. The California-based owners of Snapchat (Evan Spiegel left, Bobby Murphy right) are set to become billionaires following reports that investors have promised the company millions. And the latest funding gives the company a valuation of £6 billion ($10 billion) Venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byer has agreed to invest in the fast-growing messaging startup Snapchat at a valuation close to £6 billion ($10 billion), reports the Wall Street Journal. Instagram has launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt. The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. The venture-capital firm had committed to invest up to £12 million ($20 million) in Snapchat in May, the Journal cited one source as saying. And apparently at least one other strategic investor has committed to joining the latest round of funding. If the deal goes through, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £6 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB. Snapchat lets users send photo-messages that vanish within seconds, but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services. This may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users. Though Snapchat and other similar mobile messaging apps don't have established business models yet, their rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so. The valuation put Snapchat (California HQ shown) in an elite group of super-rich tech startups. More than 700 million snaps are sent a day but the company is yet to make any serious revenue. However it apparently has plans to monetise the app in future. This may include allowing people to transfer money to other users . Snapchat is continuing to grow in popularity, with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day. In June Facebook launched a similar app called Slingshot in the hope of replicating Snapchat’s success. The app allows consumers to exchange photos and videos, which will later disappear, without requiring Facebook accounts. But despite its rapid growth, Snapchat has had a number of obstacles to contend with. The group this year settled charges with US regulators, which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time. According to the Federal Trade Commission at the time, photos sent on Snapchat could, in fact, be saved by recipients using several methods, such as taking a screenshot.","California-based owners of Snapchat are set to become billionaires .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . For many people living in towns and cities, growing flowers, fruits or vegetables is out of the question. But a team of inventors from San Francisco has unveiled a device that makes it possible, via an indoor greenhouse that can be controlled by a smartphone. By connecting their phone to the greenhouse, people will be able to grow fruit and vegetables in their homes without needing access to a garden. Scroll down for video . A team in San Francisco has invented the world's first greenhouse that can be controlled by a smartphone (shown) - so wannabe gardeners can grow fruit and veg in their own homes. The indoor gadget boasts a built-in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth . The device uses a fully automated hydroponic system, with sensors and actuators, to simulate real environmental conditions. To start growing, a user just tells the app what sort of plant has been selected. A programme specific to that plant will then load, initiating a lighting and irrigation sequence and the right conditions for the type of plant and its stage of growth. As it grows, the app will ask for feedback, for example, ‘can you see any leaves?’ The software will then adjust its settings based on this feedback to provide an even better environment for your plant to thrive. The company claims you can grow almost anything that will fit in the tray. This includes house plants, flowers, vegetables, several kinds of fruits and various herbs. However you can’t grow root vegetables just yet, although this will be available in the near future. In a week the standard sized greenhouse can grow three to five tomatoes, two to three peppers and one lettuce at peak function. Source: getniwa.com . The indoor gadget uses a built-in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth. The glass-sided device uses special sensors to pick up these readings, which then automatically activate different parts of the machine. And the device warms up, cools down, turns on a light or waters the plants autonomously without input from the user. The contraption, called Niwa, can be used to grow flowers, fruits, vegetables or herbs. It will come in three sizes and is delivered in an easy-to-assemble kit. Once a user has planted their desired seeds they simply choose which crop it is from a list on the Niwa smartphone app. The machine then adjusts the settings to match the requirements for that specific plant. Niwa is the brainchild of San Francisco pair Javier Morillias, 32, and Agnieszka Nazaruk, 27. Mr Morillias said: 'I kept seeing trucks filled with different vegetables ready to be delivered to various countries and it made no sense to me. 'I started wondering what happened, why the production had gone that far from the consumer. 'The answer I found was because we just can't grow them ourselves because of the lack of time, space, conditions or skills. 'I decided to start using technology to make the whole process simple and to enable everyone to grow their own food wherever they are.' Video courtesy of NIWA .

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could increase the risk of a child suffering ADHD . Women who take antidepressants while pregnant could be driving the rise of children with short attention spans. Scientists found the risk of a child developing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder - ADHD - was raised if their mothers had been prescribed pills for depression during pregnancy. The research, conducted by doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the U.S., looked at 7,800 children aged between two and 19 years old. They found that those children who had been exposed to antidepressants in the womb were more likely to have ADHD, a condition linked to impulsiveness, restlessness and hyperactivity. If the mother had stopped taking the drugs before they became pregnant, however, the risk of ADHD was significantly reduced. Around one in seven women suffer depression during pregnancy. Although many cases are minor, an estimated 20,000 women each year take antidepressants - around 4 per cent of all British pregnancies. The NHS advises that doctors only prescribe the drugs to pregnant women if the risk of depression is higher than the risk of any harm caused. ADHD is a problem that is rapidly growing in the UK. Prescriptions for the condition rose from 92,100 in 1997 to 786,400 in 2012, NHS figures show. Some doctors think the figures are partly explained by a greater awareness of the condition, but the new research may suggest a link to the drugs taken by mothers. The research, published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, warned that the risk of ADHD had to be balanced against the risk of depression. The authors wrote: ‘Maternal depression during pregnancy is associated with health complications for both the mother and child.’ ‘Discontinuation of antidepressants during pregnancy can increase the risk of relapse fivefold.’The authors looked at 2,200 children with ADHD and 5,600 healthy children. They found a ‘modest risk’ of increased chance of ADHD in children whose mothers had been prescribed antidepressants during pregnancy. The study also found there was no heightened risk of a child having autism if a pregnant mother had taken antidepressants - disproving previous beliefs that the drugs were linked the social disorder. Roy Perlis, who led the research, said the findings should not dissuade mothers-to-be from taking the prescribed medication. He added that the end to speculation about the link to autism was particularly significant. However the report authors warned the risk of ADHD had to be balanced against the risk of depression - which also brings health complications for both mother and child . Dr Perlis said: ‘We know that untreated . depression can pose serious health risks to both a mother and child, so . it’s important that women being treated with antidepressants who become . pregnant, or who are thinking about becoming pregnant, know that these . medications will not increase their child’s risk of autism.’ NICE - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - advises that antidepressants are not recommended for most pregnant women, especially during the early stages of a pregnancy. But they say exceptions can be made depending on the severity of the depression. If a woman is already depressed, withdrawing any treatment could make it far worse. Experts today welcomed the new study - but said far more research is needed. Dr Celso Arango, scientific director of the Spanish Centre for Biomedical Research in Mental Health, said: ‘This is a nice study, however, a more robust piece would be an epidemiological cohort study in which subjects were not chosen specifically because they were depressed. ‘It is not clear how big the effect of antidepressant use is. Certainly it is minimal compared to genetic factors. ‘From the child’s perspective it is likely that the potential harm caused by any increased risk of ADHD or autism would be much less than the potential harm of having a mother suffering from depression. ‘And of course, that is without even mentioning the issue of depression causing mothers to die by suicide during pregnancy.’","Children exposed to this medication in womb were more likely to have ADHD .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . The number of parents who can correctly identify their children as overweight or obese has fallen over the past two decades . Obesity is skewing the way we view those who are overweight - and could be wreaking havoc on children's health, a study has warned. New research has revealed that between 1988 and 2010, the number of parents who could correctly identify their children as overweight or obese went down. And the increasing trend of weight underestimation is extremely alarming, the researchers caution. 'Today, almost one out of every three children is overweight or obese,' said senior author Dr Jian Zhang of Georgia Southern University. 'They are at significantly increased risk of a number of diseases as they grow older, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis and cancer.' And the first step to dealing with any problem is being aware of it, he told Reuters Health. Dr Zhang and his team examined height and weight data on 2,871 children - aged between six and 11 - from the 1988 to 1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the U.S. Then they assessed 3,202 similar youngsters from the 2005 to 2010 cycles of the survey. In all cases, the children’s parents were asked if they considered their child ‘overweight, underweight, just about the right weight, or don’t know'. In the 1988 to 1994 data set, 78 per cent of parents of an overweight boy and 61 per cent of parents of an overweight girl, wrongly identified the child as ‘about the right weight.’ That number increased to 83 per cent for boys and 78 per cent for girls in the 2005 to 2010 period. Similarly, for obese boys, 26 per cent of parents said they were ‘about the right weight’ in 1988. This is compared to 37 per cent in 2010, according to the results, published in the journal Pediatrics. Like their parents, many children also identify themselves as about the right weight even if they are overweight or obese. And these youngsters are also less likely to try to lose weight. Commenting on the new findings, Dr Zhang said:  'Studies overwhelmingly show that parental perceptions of their child’s weight influence family readiness to foster healthy behaviours. 'Increasingly underestimating puts more kids at the risk of becoming overweight or obese.' One reason for it might be that parental perceptions might be . changing over time as obesity becomes more common, since people . generally judge themselves (and their children) against the people . around them. It's also possible that more parents are . unwilling to admit their children are overweight due to the increasing . stigma of obesity, said Dr Zhang. Experts say part of the problem is that parents are also overweight - so they don't see the extent of their child's weight problem . Other studies have shown that overweight adults are increasingly not perceiving themselves as overweight, said Mary Burke, a senior economist in the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who was not involved in the study. The misclassification rate was quite high for both time periods, she points out. 'For six to 11 year old children, a lot of parents could say ""I’m waiting to make a pronouncement because kids are always changing - and they grow out of it"",' she said. 'And ""about the right weight"" could reasonably include some kids who are slightly overweight but close to the healthy weight category.' It is the misperception that a child is not obese that's important, she stressed. And though it seems logical that parents who more accurately perceive their kids’ weight will be more ready to try to change an overweight child’s behavior, it may not be that simple, she said. 'It’s not clear that if a doctor hammers home that a child is overweight, the parent will have more readiness to help child engage in more healthful behaviors. 'Do you really need to change parental perception first? It may be more effective to promote healthier behaviors among all kids.'","U.S. researchers looked at data from 1988-1994 and 2005-2010 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . For animal lovers, the chance to see majestic creatures such as whales in their natural habitat is often the high point of a holiday. But conservationists have warned that boat trips to watch whales and dolphins might be stressing them out and putting their survival in jeopardy. Minke whales off the coast of Iceland have been observed breathing heavily and speeding away from tourist boats, while populations of bottlenose dolphins in New Zealand on popular boat routes have plummeted. Some experts think is because they are being driven from their preferred feeding grounds by well-meaning tourists eager to see their favourite animal. Scroll down for video . Not so green after all: Conservationists have warned that boat trips to watch whales and dolphins (stock image) might be stressing them out and putting their survival in jeopardy . Boat trips have been considered an example of 'friendly' eco-tourism, but some routes are affecting cetacean behaviour and even causing deaths by collisions, conservationists at the International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC) in Glasgow, were told last week. Scientists are most concerned about disruption causing marine animals to expend extra energy or failing to eat in their preferred areas, Nature reported. David Lusseau of the University of Aberdeen showed that minke whales swimming in Faxaflói Bay in Iceland sped away from whale-watching boats. Earlier this year he also reported that the whales breathed more heavily in the presence of a boat trip – just like they do when they are stressed and encounter a predator. David Lusseau of the University of Aberdeen showed that minke whales swimming in Faxaflói Bay in Iceland sped away from whale-watching boats . Minke whales off the coast of Iceland have been observed upping their speed and breathing heavily when boats came near - indicating stress. A stock image of the whales in Antarctica is pictured . Many people may think – why not stop eco-tourism boat trips all together? But they offer jobs to locals who may traditionally have hunted the animals. Such trips also spread an important message of conservation. By attracting tourists, they also become a valuable commodity to be kept safe. The number of people taking eco-tourism boat trips is thought to be around 13 million across 119 countries. The 2008 figure shows a massive rise in popularity compared with 1991, when four million people in 31 countries took the trips. In 2008, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, estimated the eco-tourism industry was worth a staggering $2.1 billion (£1.3bn). While a new study will note that numbers of whales have not been affected by boat trips in the area, Dr Lusseau has shown that similar trips have led to depleted bottlenose dolphin populations in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. He fears the animals could become extinct in a matter of decades, as they appear to be driven away from feeding grounds by the tourist boats. In order to tackle the problem, Dr Lusseau thinks scientists must work out which populations are most at risk, by looking at the short-term effects of eco-tourism and modelling them over long periods. This way, they could separate adaptations from long-term threats. He thinks that measures such as minimum distances between animals and boats could help, if they are standardised and enforced. Some scientists are concerned that eco-tourism trips are killing animals one at a time and say that boat trips could prove to be the nail in the coffin for struggling species that have previously been threatened by hunting. Bottlenose dolphins could become extinct in a matter of decades in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand (mapped) as they appear to be driven away from feeding grounds by the tourist boats, experts said . Dr Lusseau has shown that eco-tourism boat trips have led to depleted bottlenose dolphin populations in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. A stock image of bottlenose dolphins is pictured . A sound that has baffled scientists since the 1960s - a strange, rhythmic noise heard underwater and similar to a slightly robotic duck quack - was recently revealed to be that of a minke whale.The bio-duck sound had been recorded at various locations in the Southern Ocean, but its source remained a mystery until April. The mysterious sounds were thought to be made by submarines, by some oceanographic phenomenon, or even by fish. In February 2013, an international team of researchers deployed acoustic tags on two Antarctic minke whales in Wilhelmina Bay off the western Antarctic Peninsula. These tags were the first acoustic tags successfully deployed on this species and the acoustic data they provided was analysed by scientists at NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Centre (NEFSC). The identification of the Antarctic minke whale as the source of the sound now indicates that some minke whales stay in ice-covered Antarctic waters year-round, while others undertake seasonal migrations to lower latitudes.","Boat trips have been found to stress minke whales and bottlenose dolphins .

"By . Louise Boyle . A husband murdered his wife and then killed himself after the couple were accused of abusing their baby - when she suffered from an undiagnosed, fatal genetic condition. David O'Shell shot his wife Tiffany in the face while she slept before turning the gun on himself. The tragic murder-suicide happened the night before they were to meet with investigators who were looking into allegations that the couple had harmed their three-month-old daughter Alyssa. Two weeks earlier, Alyssa had been taken from her parents after the child was found to have 11 fractures by doctors. Tragic events: David O'Shell shot his wife Tiffany before killing himself at their home in Colorado after he was wrongly accused of abusing his daughter Alyssa who had a rare genetic condition . The couple's bodies were found on June 30, 2008 at their home in Lakewood, Colorado by Tiffany's father Paul when he could not reach them by telephone. It was the same day that Dr Joyce Oleszek at Children's Hospital Colorado began to suspect that Alyssa was suffering from a rare disease and ordered genetic testing. A week later, the fears were confirmed  - the baby was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, a fatal condition in babies. The condition meant that Alyssa was unable to develop muscles needed for sitting up, supporting her head or standing. It also meant her bones broke easily. Alyssa died in her grandfather's arms on October 28 just a few months after her parents. The child's maternal grandparents Paul and Jackie . Cuin spoke out about their family tragedy to raise awareness of their late granddaughter's genetic disorder. They told the Denver Post about the despair the young couple, both police officers, had gone . through when their baby was taken away by social services and placed . with a foster family. Devoted: The couple were devastated when their daughter was placed in foster care at three months old while they were investigated . Mr Cuin told the Post: 'The last thing she [Tiffany] said to me was, ''Please help me save my husband and my family''... nobody would listen.' He struggles to forgive his son-in-law for his actions. However Mrs Cuin told the Post: 'I get it. I understand. He loved her too much. He was going to lose his wife. His job. His military service. He . was never going to get Alyssa back.' The last thing Tiffany said to me was, 'Please help me save my husband and my family'... nobody would listen. Paul Cuin, father . The Cuins believe that Colorado social services were 'overzealous' when it came to the case. Tiffany Cuin had studied at the University of Northern Colorado and originally planned to work with children who have special needs before deciding to become a police officer. She worked with the Lakewood Police Department, where she met her future husband William David O'Shell. The couple married and had their first baby - a daughter named Alyssa. Three months after she was born, Tiffany noticed that her daughter cried when she lifted her leg while changing her nappy. The next day, Alyssa's leg appeared swollen so the couple took their baby to the doctor where an X-ray revealed a possible fracture. In pain: Three-month-old Alyssa was discovered to have the fatal genetic condition spinal muscular atrophy . At hospital, 11 fractures were found in the baby's legs, causing staff to call social services. Alyssa was taken away from her parents and placed in foster care while the entire family came under scrutiny as child abuse suspects. Several people questioned the allegations, including several doctors who wanted a bone specialist to test Alyssa and a social worker who noted the lack of bruising or other external injuries. Torn apart: Tiffany and David O'Shell with their daughter Alyssa . The couple were only allowed a supervised visit for one hour with their newborn. Mr O'Shell became the main suspect because he had once picked the baby up by her legs to kiss her belly. His mental state deteriorated as he heard he could face felony charges and be imprisoned, causing him to lose his job and his family. On June 30, 2008 the couple missed an . 8am appointment with the hospital about their case and never showed up to . meetings with their lawyers later in the day. They were later discovered . dead at their home. On the same day, Alyssa's foster mother . brought her to the hospital because she was concerned about the . baby's lack of development and difficulty breathing. After burying their daughter and . son-in-law, the Cuins launched a legal battle and were finally given . custody of their granddaughter in July. They looked after Alyssa around the clock as her condition worsened. After her death a few months later, a short obituary read: 'Alyssa, 7 months old, rejoined her parents on Oct. 28, 2008.' Although . the grandparents sued the child protection investigators, they lost the . case after authorities argued that their actions had not been willfully . or wantonly wrong.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A four-year-old was diagnosed with leukaemia when her worried mother researched her symptoms on the internet, having been told by a doctor the toddler had an ear infection. Alia-Grace Birch is now facing two years of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy after tests confirmed she had the blood cancer last month. Her mother, Michelle, first suspected something was seriously wrong when her daughter kept falling asleep at nursery. The 23-year-old took her daughter to a local GP, who diagnosed the toddler with a viral infection and sent her home with antibiotics. After being told her daughter Alia-Grace was suffering a viral infection, Michelle Birch felt it was something more serious and took to Google to research the four-year-old's symptoms . After taking Alia-Grace to A&E, tests revealed the four-year-old had an extremely high white blood cell count, leading doctors to diagnose her with leukaemia . But Ms Birch, from Bentilee in Staffordshire, was convinced there was something more to Alia-Grace's condition, and turned to the internet to research her symptoms. Days later she rushed her daughter into A&E where tests revealed the four-year-old was suffering an aggressive form of leukaemia. She was admitted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire before being transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she started chemotherapy. Ms Birch, who has shaved her head in support of her daughter, said: 'It's horrible, you never expect something like this to happen to your baby girl. 'We're all in this together and we just hope my little girl will get better. 'I took her to the GP because she had been falling asleep at nursery and she said she had earache. 'I kept taking her to the doctors who gave her antibiotics as they thought it was a viral thing. 'I went onto the internet and put her symptoms into Google and a number of medical websites suggested it could be cancer. 'Then when she fell asleep at nursery again, I knew I had to bring her to the hospital - but you still don't expect to be told your baby has cancer. 'It still feels like a dream but, if I am strong, then Alia is strong. I didn't want her to feel left out, or feel like the only person, so I shaved my hair. 'I don't think she fully understands. She knows she's poorly but not how serious it is. 'She was always having bruises and wasn't herself.' Alia-Grace first fell ill at the beginning of July, suffering an ear and throat infection. Ms Birch and her daughter pictured before Alia-Grace fell ill . Alia-Grace first fell ill in July with an ear and throat infection. But when she kept falling asleep at nursery, her mother became really concerned . Ms Birch, who has shaved her hair to support her daughter, said Alia-Grace is facing two years of chemotherapy and radiotherapy as doctors try to treat her disease . Blood cancer is an umbrella term for cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow and lymphatic system. The diseases can be life-threatening, partly because they stop the immune system working properly. When a person's immune system is badly damaged, they can die from an infection their body could normally fight off. Every 20 minutes, someone in the UK is told they have a blood cancer - that is 70 people a day, or 25,000 people a year. Many more live with debilitating – and sometimes life-threatening – blood disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Some types of blood cancer are more common than others: .

Two weeks later, on July 15, Ms Birch took the four-year-old to hospital where tests revealed an extremely high white blood cell count and she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The next day, she was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she was given steroids, antibiotics and started chemotherapy. Alia-Grace has now been allowed home but she needs drugs every day and a lumbar puncture - where a needle is injected into her spine - once a week. Alia's grandmother Joanne Horton-Birch, 42, said: 'At first she wasn't happy when we said she's going to lose her hair, because it was really long and she thought she was Rapunzel. 'Bits had been coming out, then the day it all came out in a big clump she looked in a mirror and said, 'it's okay, it will grow back'. 'If it hadn't been for Alia, how she's coped, I think we would all be in bits. 'Seeing how strong she is with everything she's going through, she still smiles. She makes us strong. 'Getting the diagnosis was devastating. Michelle had been putting the symptoms into the internet, as a lot of parents do, and that was one thing that came up. 'I told her to shut up, it's not going to be that. It's going to be a viral infection as the doctor thought, or she's anaemic. So we were all devastated. 'Usually when children are diagnosed with leukaemia, they do a lumbar puncture to confirm it. 'Alia's white blood count should be between eight and 10 but it was 300 so they knew straight away. 'It was fortunate Michelle took her to hospital when she did because it meant they could start treatment straight away. We are keeping positive for Alia's sake.'","Alia-Grace Birch fell ill with an ear and throat infection in July .

"By . Simon Jones for MailOnline . Nikola Zigic is the surprise name being linked with Arsenal as Arsene Wenger searches for a solution to Olivier Giroud's injury. The 6ft 8in striker is a free agent having left Birmingham when his lucrative contract finished in July. Reports in his native Serbia say Zigic is due to travel to London for a medical ahead of signing a one year deal. The one obstacle will be whether he can gain a work permit as Zigic has not played for his national side in recent months. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger refuse to rule out buying a striker . Shock: Nikola Zigic has been linked with a move to Arsenal as Arsene Wenger tries to solve his striker shortage following the injury to Olivier Giroud . Big man: At 6ft 8in, Zigic would certainly present problems in the air should he join the Gunners . Nikola Zigic signed for Birmingham for £6million in 2010. He scored against Arsenal in the 2011 Carling Cup final, which the Blues won 2-1. He scored 32 goals in 132 league games in two different divisions at St Andrew's . The striker’s agent told Serbian papers on Wednesday: ‘Wenger called me on Tuesday and stressed his desire to sign Zigic. ‘He was offered a contract until the end of the year, with a view to it being extended to 2015 – we’ll see what happens.’ Zigic, who is 34 next month, joined Birmingham in 2010 and scored against Arsenal in the 2011 Carling Cup final. He also played a part in Birmingham's great escape from relegation at the end of last season. The Blues needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Saviour: Zigic spent last season at Birmingham, where he helped them avoid relegation from the Championship . Shortage: Arsene Wenger is light on firepower up front and is looking to bring a striker in . Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Zigic scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Paul Caddis, who headed home to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status. Wenger surprised many with his move for midfielder Kim Kallstrom in January but this could surpass that deal for shock value. On Tuesday, he said: 'We have plenty of players at centre forward. In England as soon as you have a problem, people want you to buy.' Arsenal had an interest in Radamel Falcao but agent Jorge Mendes, fresh from finalising Angel di Maria's transfer, went from Manchester's Lowry Hotel to Monaco on Tuesday to discuss his client Falcao's move to Real Madrid. Giroud may not make another appearance until next year after suffering a serious ankle injury in the dying moments of Saturday's 2-2 draw at Everton, shortly after scoring Arsenal's equaliser.

"By . Amanda Williams . A man has stabbed to death two government workers in China after they told him they couldn't register his fourth child, it has today been claimed. Four other workers were injured in the incident, including one whose hand was severed. They had told the man they were unable to record the birth because he had not paid a fine for breaching China's 'one child only' family planning laws, it has been reported. Footage of the unnamed father outside a family planning office in southern China's Guangxi region, still brandishing a machete as police tried to subdue him has emerged. A man is seen waving a machete after allegedly stabbed to death two government workers in China. It is believed they told him they couldn't register his fourth child because he had breached family planning policy . It comes after a months of protests against authority in China that have turned violent in recent months. Thirty years ago the China introduced highly unpopular family planning rules which limited most urban couples to one child and rural families to two - if the first is a girl. Family planning officials have confirmed that a man and a woman at the office died in the attack and four other workers were injured, including a woman who had her right hand cut off. An official from the Family Planning Commission of Fangchenggang city said the suspect was certified mentally disabled. Police wearing helmets and armed with long metal battled to bring the man them under control, according to footage broadcast on Guangxi TV. Associated Press reports that the suspect has now been detained. The official Xinhua News Agency, said staff at the Dongxing City Family Planning Bureau - which comes under Fangchenggang city - had refused to register the man's fourth child for a hukou, or resident's certificate, because he hadn't paid a social compensation fee. Four other workers were injured in the incident, including one whose hand was severed. It is believed they told the man they couldn't record the birth because he had not paid a fine for breaching China's 'one child only' family planning laws . The man is believed to be a villager and has one son and three daughters. He was said to be trying to register a second son . The fine is levied on parents who break family planning laws and can be up to 10 times a family's annual income. A child without a hukou faces problems registering for education, health care and government benefits . The man - named only by his last name He - is believed to have broken into the government building and attacked the six victim. The man is believed to be a villager and has one son and three daughters. It is not known whether he has previously paid a social compensation fee. China has been besieged by cases of people who have turned to violence to attract attention to their fights for justice. On Saturday, a motorcycle taxi driver detonated a homemade bomb at Beijing's main airport after eight years of frustration trying to seek redress for an attack by city guards that left him paralysed and in debt, according to his brother. And last month, a 60-year-old man reportedly chronicled online his unsuccessful efforts to get a local police station to correct his age so he could be eligible for social security payments. A day later he reportedly set fire to a crowded commuter bus, killing 47 people.","Four moreworkers were injured including one whose hand was severed .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Weight-loss surgery can also reap positive effects on brain activity, new research suggests. The team of scientists behind the study also said there is evidence the operations could reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They found the procedures can curb changes in the brain associated with weight gain and improve cognitive function involved in planning, strategising and organising. A new study by scientists in Brazil has found evidence that weight-loss surgery can help improve brain function. They found gastric bypass procedures can curb changes in the brain that are associated with obesity . Bariatric . surgery is generally used as a last resort to help people who are . dangerously overweight. It involves either reducing the size of the . stomach or shortening the distance food travels through the digestive . tract - limiting the time it has to be absorbed. The procedures, available on the NHS, are known to be highly effective in cases of serious obesity. But they also appear to have a positive influence on brain activity, according to the new findings. A . study of the impact of bariatric surgery on 17 obese women found it . produced distinct improvements in mental functions linked to planning, . strategy and organisation. Professor . Cintia Cercato, from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, said: 'When . we studied obese women prior to bariatric surgery, we found some areas . of their brains metabolised sugars at a . higher rate than normal weight women. 'In . particular, obesity led to altered activity in a part of the brain . linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease - the posterior . cingulate gyrus. Since bariatric surgery reversed this activity, we . suspect the procedure may contribute to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's . disease and other forms of dementia.' Past research has shown that obese individuals are 35 per cent more at risk of developing Alzheimer's than people of normal weight. The new . research focused on a procedure known as a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass . (RYBG) which combines the two types of bariatric surgery. Brain scans and a range of psychological . tests were used to assess its effect over a period of six months. Results . from the obese women were compared with those from a 'control' group of . 16 lean women who did not undergo bariatric surgery. The researchers also noted evidence the surgery reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease . The . scans showed that the excessive brain activity regarding sugar seen in the obese women . disappeared after the procedure. Six months post-surgery, brain . metabolism levels were similar in both groups of women. In addition, bariatric surgery seemed to improve the performance of the obese women in a test of 'executive function'. This . is the brain's ability to connect past experience and current action, . and is involved in planning, organising and making strategic decisions. Other tests measuring various aspects of memory and thinking ability showed no change after bariatric surgery. The results appear in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, published by the Endocrine Society. Professor Cercato said: 'Our findings suggest the brain is another organ that benefits from weight loss induced by surgery. 'The . increased brain activity the obese women exhibited before undergoing . surgery did not result in improved cognitive performance, which suggests . obesity may force the brain to work harder to achieve the same level of . cognition.' Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, the UK’s leading dementia research charity, said: 'Although obesity has been linked to an increased risk of dementia, this very small study doesn’t tell us whether weight loss surgery could prevent the condition. 'This research involved people in their 40s and did not look at dementia, and we don’t know whether the changes in brain activity seen in this study would affect a person’s risk of developing the condition. 'The people included in this research were severely obese, so it’s hard to know how these results might relate to people whose obesity does not warrant this type of surgery. 'Continued investment in research is important if we are to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the links between obesity and increased dementia risk. 'A better understanding of how factors such as obesity may affect our risk of dementia could give us important clues for preventing the condition. 'In the meantime, research shows we can lower our risk of dementia by eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, and keeping blood pressure and weight in check.'","Scientists in Brazil found gastric bypass surgery can affect brain activity .

"By . Matt Morlidge for MailOnline . Follow @@MattMorlidge . All eyes are on Arsenal on Wednesday night as the Gunners look to progress to the Champions League group stages yet again. Standing in their way at the Emirates Stadium will be Besiktas, who are by no means out of the tie after a 0-0 in the first leg in Turkey. We all know about former Newcastle and Chelsea striker Demba Ba, but here Sportsmail looks at three other stars who could trouble the Gunners. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Oxlade-Chamberlain: We weren't great technically in 1st leg . Star man: Demba Ba is an obvious threat for Besiktas against Arsenal on Wednesday night . Worry: But who else could trouble Arsene Wenger's side as they look to progress to the group stage? Oguzhan Ozyakup . Position Central midfielder . Age 21 . Former clubs AZ, Arsenal . Apart from Ba, Ozyakup was Besiktas' most dangerous player in the first leg. Operating in the hole just behind the striker, the youngster picked passes intelligently and found space to worry Mikel Arteta. Looking at his technical style, its no wonder the Turkish-born playmaker used to ply his trade in North London. Ozyakup came through the ranks under Arsene Wenger, but managed just one Capital One Cup substitute appearance with the Gunners well stocked in his position. Wenger allowed him to jump ship, and admitted he was happy to see the youngster progress. Talent: 21-year-old Oguzhan Ozyakup was impressive in the first leg, avoiding Aaron Ramsey who was sent off . 'He was educated by us and we saw that he had top quality and technically he is very good,' Wenger told the club website. 'Physically he can run all day, he has very good stamina and a good final pass. 'I always thought he could make a career but at our club he had big competition in front of him and that is why we let him go. 'It is good to see he has made it to the top level and is now an important player in Turkey.' Back again: Ozyakup is a former youth product at Arsenal, and will be looking to haunt the Gunners . Olcay Sahan . Position Winger . Age 26 . Former clubs Borussia Monchengladbach, Duisberg, Kaiserslauten . After paving a career for himself in Germany, the place of his birth, Sahan has impressed at Besiktas since his move in 2012. A hard working left-winger, who has a decent turn of pace, he has since received call ups to the Turkish national team. Tracked Mathieu Debuchy well in the first leg, only once or twice letting the energetic Frenchman out of his sights. Also capable of playing further in-field. Unlucky: Olcay Sahan was dangerous in the first leg on the left wing . Ramon Motta . Position Left back . Age 26 . Former clubs Internacional, Vasco de Gama, Corinthians . Your typical Brazilian full back. Motta bombed forward in the first leg, often looking to unleash a shot towards goal with his left foot. Motta impressed on a loan deal last season, so much so he was given a permanent contract, but his attacking prowess can also turn into a defensive liability. In the first-especially, Alexis Sanchez exploited the space on the right-hand side Motta left vacant, and whoever plays there for Arsenal on Wednesday night will be looking to do the same thing. Dangerous: Ramon Motta was impressive going forward from left back, but there will be space to exploit . Remember him? Kerim Frei, 21 . The former Fulham wonderkid shot to fame in West London with several impressive displays, including a man-of-the-match performance against local rivals Chelsea. Fell out of favour under Martin Jol, though, and was eventually sold to Besiktas for around £2million via a loan spell at Cardiff. Of Austrian descent but has now played four times for Turkey.

"By . Leon Watson . Updated: . 05:03 EST, 15 December 2011 . A street sweeper casually rakes leaves from a path before ducking behind a bush. Seconds later he emerges with a bazooka and gets a clear shot on a Syrian army tank. It is blasted into oblivion. This is what is happening in the war-torn city of Homs, and it is mirrored across the country. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE VIDEO . A bazooka is fired at a tank in the Syrian city of Homs as violence erupts around the country . Street fighting has broken out as President Assad orders a crackdown on anti-government protesters . Today, activists said Syrian forces fired on a funeral and charged a U.S.-born blogger with trying to incite sectarian strife. After a bloody day of attacks that left at least 28 people dead yesterday five passengers in a car were also killed before anti-government insurgents hit back attacking a army convoy and killing eight soldiers. Razan Ghazzawi is the latest among dozens of activists, journalists and bloggers who have been detained since the revolt against President Bashar Assad began nine months ago. The brutal crackdown that followed has now killed more than 5,000 people and put thousands into security lockups, the U.N. said. Blogger Razan Ghazzawi was traveling to Jordan to attend a conference on freedom of the press in the region when she was arrested, her friends said . Ms Ghazzawi, 31, had been documenting human rights abuses in recent months, and was arrested on December 4 at the border while on her way to Jordan for a conference on press freedoms. On Monday, she was charged by Syrian authorities with trying to incite sectarian strife, spreading false information and weakening national sentiment. It is a charge often leveled against those who challenge the Syrian regime, according to rights activists, and could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years. The Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression in the Arab World where Ghazzawi worked said today that Ms Ghazzawi denied all the charges. 'We demand the immediate and unconditional release of our colleague Razan Ghazzawi as well as an end to her trial and the annulment of the completely baseless charges against her,' the SCM said. Despite growing international pressure on his regime, Assad has forged ahead with his crackdown, unleashing security forces and the army on cities in a bid to crush an uprising inspired by similar revolts across the Arab world.

The Syrian regime and opposition activists traded accusations over the explosion . On Tuesday, regime forces fired on thousands of people taking part in a funeral procession in the northern city of Idlib, killing two people and pushing the day's death toll to at least 28. The flare-up of violence near the Turkish border is fresh evidence that the Syrian uprising is growing into a full fledged insurgency. Military defectors known as the Free Syrian Army have recently been fighting back with increasingly sophisticated attacks. It has given many protesters hope of a fighting chance against President Assad's fiercely loyal forces, but also complicating an uprising that was once largely peaceful. Troops opened fired on a car traveling through central Syria today, killing all five passengers inside, activists said. The Local Coordination Committees . activist network and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human . Rights said five people were traveling near the village of Khattab in . the countryside of the central Hama province at dawn, when their car . came under a barrage of gunfire from Syrian soldiers. The groups did not say why the car . was targeted, but security forces frequently target suspected . anti-government activists in the restive area. The Observatory also reported heavy . gunfire in Hirak village in the southern province of Daraa as troops . backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers hunted for activists. Three anti-regime military defectors were wounded in clashes with Syrian . security forces in the area, it said. In retaliation, gunmen believed to be army defectors opened fire on a military convoy in . central Syria, killing eight soldiers, an activist group said. The vehicle 'exploded in a ball of fire,' said Rami Abdul-Rahman, . director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which . relies on a network of activists on the ground inside the country. The defectors have found shelter in . cities and villages among sympathetic Syrians, their presence giving the . regime a pretext to crack down even more strongly than before. Authorities . have also used the attacks by defectors to support their official . narrative that the unrest in Syria is the work of armed gangs and . terrorists, not true reform seekers. The U.S., EU and the Arab League have imposed economic sanctions on Syria, and Washington and its Western allies are pushing for U.N. sanctions as well on Assad's regime.

Security Council - have resisted the idea, and on Tuesday Russia's foreign minister accused the West of taking an 'immoral' stance on Syria and ignoring violence by the Syrian opposition. Sergey Lavrov added that armed groups attacking Syrian government forces are 'aiming to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe and get a pretext for demanding an outside interference into the conflict'. Tuesday's violence began in two villages near the Turkish border, after security forces entered and shot dead two civilians, according to Rami Abdul-Rahman of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Regime forces also swept through villages in the area and attacked infiltrators at the border. Residents of the villages of Maaret Musreen and Kfar Bahmoul responded by closing a main road with rocks and burning tires to the Syrian troops, who then opened fire at random, Mr Abdul-Rahman said, killing 11 civilians and wounding 26. Message: Demonstrators protesting against the regime gather in Kafranbel, near Adlb, last week . 'These are intentional killings by the terrorists gangs of the regime,' said Mr Abu Mohammed, a resident of the nearby town of Maaret al-Numan, said, . 'We will not abandon our demands,' he said. 'We want the downfall of the regime and we want the president to be put on trial, because he is behind the killings that the Syrian people are being subjected to.' Under fire: Syrian President Bashar Assad has ordered a crackdown on protesters that has left an estimated 5,000 people dead . Army defectors later retaliated by attacking a security convoy in the nearby town of Bab el-Hawa with AK-47s and rocket propelled grenades, killing seven troops, activists said. Mr Abdul-Rahman said security forces also killed three other people in the provincial capital of Idlib and two in the central province of Homs. The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, gave a similar death toll. Syria's state media reported that border guards intercepted 15 gunmen trying to sneak into the country from Turkey on Monday night. It said two were killed in the ensuing firefight and others were wounded. It was the second such infiltration attempt from Turkey in a week. Members of the Free Syrian Army have found shelter alongside thousands of Syrian refugees on the Turkish side of the frontier, making use of mountainous terrain, local smuggling networks and support among villagers on the Syrian side to stage cross-border attacks. SANA also reported that 'armed terrorists' - its usual term for regime opponents - shot and killed Brigadier General Ghanem Ibrahim al-Hassan, who teaches at the Assad Military Engineering Academy in the town of Saraqeb in Idlib. Since the revolt began, the Assad regime has blamed the bloodshed on terrorists acting out a foreign conspiracy to divide and undermine Syria. Until recently, most deaths appeared to be caused by security forces firing on mainly peaceful protests.

"By . Luke Salkeld . One of the three remaining  survivors of the Great Escape has died at the age of 92. Les Brodrick was among 76 men who managed to tunnel out of a Second World War prison camp beneath the feet of their German captors. Mr Brodrick, an RAF flight lieutenant, and 72 others were recaptured. Fifty of them were executed on Hitler’s orders but he survived. Hero: Les Brodrick, pictured left during the Second World War and right in his later years, has died aged 92 . Only three prisoners made it to safety in the breakout from Stalag Luft III, which was immortalised in the 1963 Hollywood film The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson. London-born Mr Brodrick spent the rest of the war in captivity before becoming a teacher in Canvey Island, Essex. He emigrated to South Africa in 1956 and died near Durban on Monday. He leaves a widow Teresa, 92, sons Roy, 67, and Duke, 70, and two grandchildren. His death leaves only two survivors from the Great Escape, Dick Churchill and Paul Royle. Mr Churchill, 93, an RAF Squadron Leader, was on the run for three or  four days before being recaptured. He lives in Devon. Mr Royle is 99 and lives in Perth, Western Australia. Flt Lt Brodrick was 22 when his  Lancaster bomber was shot down near Amiens, northern France, in 1943 on  the way back from a bombing raid on Stuttgart. Four of the seven crew died in the crash-landing. Escape: The tunnel system Mr Brodrick and 75 other troops used to break out of Stalag Luft III . Lucky: Although the Flight Lieutenant was recaptured, he was spared the firing squad unlike 50 comrades . Mr Brodrick was sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, now part of Poland, 100 miles east of Berlin.There, more than 600 prisoners of war were involved in the construction of three tunnels codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry. Mr Brodrick was appointed ‘trapfuhrer’ – he was responsible for the entrance to Dick, opening it for the tunnellers to enter, sealing them in and keeping watch as they worked. Dick and Tom were abandoned but Harry, which was 111 yards long was used on the night of the escape on March 24, 1944. Priority was given to higher-ranking captives and those who could speak German. Family: Mr Brodrick with (left to right) sons Duke and Roy, and wife Teresa on the couple's 65th wedding anniversary; he settled in South Africa after the end of the war . Mr Brodrick was 52nd to emerge out of the tunnel of the 76 who managed to escape before guards spotted them and raised the alarm. He and two colleagues, Henry Birkland and Denys Street, travelled at night until they came to a cottage. They tried to ‘spin a yarn’ to the occupants – only to find the men  were German soldiers. They were arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo. Mr Street was among those who were shot. Mr Brodrick was sent back to the camp until it was evacuated in January 1945 as Allied forces approached. He was among those liberated by British troops near Lubeck on May 2 and was flown back to England in a Lancaster from his old 106 Squadron. His cousin John Fishlock, who has researched the Great Escape, said Mr Brodrick had become a forgotten hero because he moved to South Africa after Canvey Island was flooded by a tidal wave in 1953, and spent the rest of his life there. He was not depicted in the film, in which most characters were composites of the real-life escapers.Mr Fishlock said yesterday: ‘He was a remarkable man who deserves recognition. ‘He never knew why he was spared the firing squad – it was simply luck of the draw. ‘His son Duke was just six months old at the time and he used to say that Hitler must  have heard about that and  spared him.’ Legendary: The story of the Great Escape was made into a Hollywood blockbuster starring Steve McQueen .","Les Brodrick was shot down in France aged 22 and sent to Stalag Luft III .

"By . Alex Peake-tomkinson . Found just off the buzzing Kings Road near Sloane Square in Chelsea, No 4 Royal Avenue is a proper ‘Downtown’ address. So it was, perhaps, the perfect home for legendary singer Petula Clark, whose classic chart hit Downtown has become something of a signature tune. Indeed, Petula loved the house so much that she kept an eye on it after she moved out, even asking its new owners if she could have a look round. Petula lived in the five-bedroom townhouse in the 1980s – and wasn’t the street’s first famous resident. Royal Avenue is the fictional home of James Bond, while architect Richard Rogers, who designed the Lloyd’s building and the Millennium Dome, lived at No 18. Royal spot: No4 Royal Avenue, off the King's Road, is a five-bedroom property on the market for £5.85million . The Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti rented No 36 for his mistress Fanny Cornforth, and American film director Joseph Losey lived at No 30. One of his best-known films,  The Servant, which starred Dirk Bogarde, James Fox, Sarah Miles and Wendy Craig, was set in an empty house opposite. No 4 is now owned by financial adviser Michael Berry, 58, and  his wife Sherifa, 52, who moved there in 1998. Their daughter Carina, 26, was living there when Petula, who had downsized a few streets away, called. ‘She was nice; the house must have meant a lot to her,’ Carina says. Inspired: The light and airy first-floor sitting room of the Chelsea property in West London . And though Petula, now 81, has sold 68 million records, appeared  in 30 films and had a new album out last year, Carina admitted: ‘I didn’t know who she was!’ But it’s no surprise that Petula had fond memories of her former home. It is an impressive early Victorian, stucco-fronted, five-bedroom, four-bathroom family home offering bright, flexible and spacious accommodation. The house benefits from a commanding position by the gravelled open space originally intended as a carriageway leading to the Royal Hospital. It has a large south-west-facing terrace. Mr Berry is now selling it with a price tag of £5.85 million, as his three daughters have moved out. Memories: Petula Clark, seen in her heyday, lived in the townhouse . He says: ‘It is an empty nest really, now  that my youngest daughter has just gone  to university.’ The property’s unusual garden arrangement is a major feature. Mr Berry says: ‘It had its garden built over, so we’ve got a roof terrace at a mezzanine level between the ground and the first floor, which, in many ways, is better than a garden because it’s less gloomy.’ He says he can grow apples and tomatoes on this raised patio, whereas ‘the only thing you can grow at ground level here are ferns’. The first-floor sitting room has a Venetian theme. ‘We’re both very fond of Venice and we’ve got quite a lot of Venetian things, . ’ Mr Berry says. ‘We’ve been to Venice twice in the past year.  My wife always likes to go and bring back things.’ The lower ground floor of the house, which used to be servants’ quarters, can be used as a separate flat. Mr Berry says: ‘It’s the perfect family house because we can live quite separately and then  come together.’ ‘My wife can watch television in one room and I can listen to music  in another.’ The Berrys, like Petula, have become ‘downtown’ fans, after moving to Chelsea from Vauxhall in South London, and won’t be going far. Mr Berry says: ‘I think three bedrooms would suit  us but it has to be in Chelsea. It can’t be anywhere else. It’s my wife’s stipulation; she likes the buzz.’ Guy Gittins, sales director at Chesterton Humberts Chelsea, says: ‘This traditional Chelsea townhouse will make an ideal family home or – for  our international buyers – a rather opulent pied- a-terre.’ Chesterton Humberts Chelsea, 020 7594 4740 .","Singer Petula Clark lived in the Chelsea townhouse in the 1980s .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Images have been released allegedly showing rockets being fired from Russia into Ukraine, and heavy artillery being rolled across the border to be used by pro-Russian rebels in the country's ongoing civil war. The U.S. government released the images today, which support claims that Russia has been providing heavy arms to rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk - parts of Ukraine under separatist control. A four-page document released from the State Department seems to show blast marks from where rockets were launched and craters where they landed. Officials said the images, sourced from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, show heavy weapons fired between July 21 and July 26. 'Proof': The U.S. State Department release and annotated the above image, dated almost a week ago. It seems to show rockets within Ukraine - and therefore operated by the rebels - firing rockets at Ukrainian positions close to the Russian border . 'Shelling Ukrainians': The above image, taken on Wednesday shows Russian artillery vehicles firing over the border towards a Ukrainian position, which is surrounded by shell holes . Such evidence will also fuel suspicions that the rebels could have been given a surface-to-air missile by Russia which was then used to shoot down flight MH17 near the Russian border more than a week ago. The theory is widely accepted by Western powers, but the rebels in Donetsk have defended themselves from the charges by claiming they had no weapons which could possibly reach high enough to touch a passenger jet at 33,000ft. The U.S. images claim to show multiple rocket launchers fired at Ukrainian forces from within Ukraine and from Russian soil. One shows dozens of craters around a Ukrainian military unit and rockets that can travel more than 7 miles. In a memo attached to the images, U.S. officials said: 'The wide area of impacts near the Ukrainian military units indicates fire from multiple rocket launchers'. 'Russian-backed attacks': The above before-and-after image purports to show a Ukrainian unit after it has been shelled by separatists . Tensions have run high around Ukraine since Russia seized Crimea in March. Washington has also been highly critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin's behaviour concerning the handling of the MH17 crash, as well as the rest of the conflict in Ukraine. More recently, U.S. intelligence officials have said they have what they call a solid circumstantial case that Russian-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine are responsible for downing the Malaysia Airlines plane. Citing satellite imagery, intercepted conversations and social media postings, officials say a Russian-made SA-11 surface-to-air missile hit the plane on July 17. Moscow angrily denies any involvement in the attack. U.S. officials said they still don't know who fired the missile or whether Russian military officers were present when it happened, and had previously declined to share any proof that the separatists had the technology to down a plane.","Government releases satellite shots from the past week it says show artillery and rocket launchers being moved .

Sportsmail can reveal that a four-year contract has been presented to the out-of-favour Manchester United midfielder and that he was close to reaching agreement on it as he prepared to fly to Dortmund for a medical.

Struggle: The 25-year-old failed to impress the three managers he worked for at Old Trafford . Jurgen Klopp repeatedly made it clear Kagawa would be welcomed back with open arms, and the Dortmund boss will get his wish after an unhappy spell at Old Trafford for the attacking midfielder. He struggled to make his mark after being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 for £12million - plus £5million add-ons - and became even more marginalised under David Moyes last season. When it became clear chances would continue to be limited under current manager Louis van Gaal, Dortmund seized their chance to lure him back with an offer of €8million up front, with a further two million to follow in add-ons. Sportsmail revealed last year how Klopp responded to a tearful farewell by Kagawa in the Dortmund dressing room by draping an arm round him and telling him the door was always open, should his United venture not go to plan. It remained in the forefront of Kagawa's thoughts and made a Dortmund reunion his preferred option, despite interest from Valencia. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page.

"By . James  Nye . It's the nation's favorite burger chain, more secret than In-N-Out and with only 11 restaurants outside of California, even rarer. Founded in Santa Barbara in 1969, The Habit Burger Grill was crowned America's best fast food burger in a recent survey, trumping the hugely popular and fashionable In-N-Out, despite having little to none brand recognition. Indeed, after the publication of the Consumer Reports findings earlier this month, The Habit's website crashed, presumably due to millions of Americans trying to discover how they could get their hands on the nation's best burger. Number 1: The Habit Burger Grill's Charburger is the nation's favorite according to a recent survey published in July . The Consumer Reports survey was notable for the fact that McDonalds came last in addition to the fact that In-N-Out didn't take the top spot. The comprehensive survey included 65 chains at which 96,208 burgers, chicken sandwiches, subs, sandwiches and burrito's were eaten. The survey posed this simple question, 'On a scale of  1 to 10, from least delicious to most delicious you’ve ever eaten, how would you rate the taste?' With The Habit's cheesburgers scoring above eight on the scale, California's best kept fast-food secret suddenly became an obsession for East Coasters everywhere. Table: The burger survey in its full glory reveals that McDonald's in last place . Besting famous chains like Five Guys and East Coast favorite Shake Shack, The Habit is known for its signature Charburger and has only recently expanded into Utah and Arizona. However, unlike In-N-Out, who steadfastly refuse to come to the East Coast, The Habit is opening a restaurant in New Jersey, just 30 minutes from New York City. Its burgers have no gimmick and do not look fancy. In fact the Charburger is a classic patty with 'mayonnaise, pickle, fresh tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun.' West AND East Cost: The Habit began in California in 1969, but is now coming to the East Coast . Toppings: The burgers come with mushroom toppings and bacon and have been voted the best in the country . Also on the menu are a fresh grilled albacore tuna sandwich, salads and shakes, sundaes and cones. The Consumer reports survey  found 21 other burgers more palatable than McDonald's Big Mac. The 2014 results show a shift in American fast-food preference, with diners placing a new importance on quality over convenience compared to the 2011 report. 'Fast-casual dining in places like Chipotle and Panda Express lets the consumer guide the staff to prepare their meal just the way they like it, Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, a food-service research and consulting firm, told the magazine. Chains like Noodles & Company and Panera, which serve meat produced without antibiotics, also ranked higher on the lists. This change in eating habits may be influenced by the millennial generation, the magazine says, who are eating at cheap fast-casual restaurants in order to dine out more often. Bottom: It may be the world second largest fast-food franchise, but McDonald's serves up the worst fast-food burgers in the United Stats according to a new survey .","The Habit Burger and Grill triumphed in recent survey to find nation's favorite fast-food burger .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A giant tortoise known as 'Pepe the missionary' after he spent time living with Franciscan missionaries on the Galapagos islands has died aged 60. During his life Pepe became famous as a mascot for the missionaries and was a favourite with tourists who came to visit and take photographs with him. Pepe, who ended his days in a corral at the Galapagos National Park's Interpretation Center, died yesterday of natural causes, said the park ecosystems director Victor Carrion. Pepe the tortoise, who became famous as the mascot for Franciscan missionaries in the Galapagos Islands, has died aged 60 of natural causes . Pepe was first adopted from the wild by by a family from San Cristobal island in the 1940s before being given over to the mission in 1967. He lived there until 2012 when he was given over to the national park following the death of Lonesome George, another giant tortoise who was thought to be the last of his species left. George was thought to be around 100 years old when he passed away, which only made him a young adult, as the species can live up to 200 years old. While it is not known exactly why Pepe died at such a young age, Mr Carrion  said that several of his organs had been slowly failing, adding that Pepe was also overweight. Park director Arturo Izurieta paid tribute to the tortoise on Twitter, saying: 'After 60 years of life, Pepe the Missionary will remain in our memories forever. Giant tortoises still exist in the wild on the Galapagos islands, near Ecuador. The unique and diverse range of flora and fauna on the islands were studied by Darwin as he developed his theory of evolution . After the death of Lonesome George (pictured), who passed away at an estimated age fo 100 in 2012, the missionaries handed Pepe over to the Galapagos National Park's Interpretation Center . 'The disappearance of Pepe the tortoise does not put his species in danger.' Pepe was a member of the Chelonoidis becki species native to Wolf Volcano on the island of Isabela. About 2,000 tortoises from the same species still live in their native habitat. The Galapagos Islands are famous for their unique flora and fauna studied by Charles Darwin as he developed his theory of evolution.","'Pepe the missionary' has died aged 60 of natural causes in Galapagos .

Having served Everton with distinction as both a player and a manager, Royle will now take a role on Roberto Martinez’s backroom staff with the specific brief of helping young players make the transition from the Academy and Under-21 ranks into the first team. It is an important appointment as a number of changes have taken place behind the scenes at Goodison this summer, with Academy Director Alan Irvine leaving to take over as manager at West Brom and Alan Stubbs, who had been in charge of the Under-21s, taking the Hibernian manager’s job.

I’m looking forward to using my experience to help the players we have here. ‘I was happy with my role at Norwich City and wouldn’t have considered an offer from any other club than Everton. It’s like coming home for me. I’d like to thank Norwich for their co-operation and understanding with this situation and I wish Neil Adams and everyone at Carrow Road all the best for the new season.’ Royle later tweeted: 'Thank you all for the kind comments. So excited to be back. I have been going to Goodison since I was 8 years old & truly honoured.’ Martinez, who has taken his squad to Austria for warm weather training, added: ‘Everyone knows the incredible influence Joe has had at our football club, both as a player and a manager. He is a true Evertonian and we all welcome him back to Goodison Park. ‘We are all very excited with the talent coming through in our Academy and we pride ourselves on the work we do with the young players.

"By . Neil Sears . Despair: Townshend said he considered suicide in his revealing new autobiography . He insisted at the time that he had simply been conducting ‘research’ when he paid £7 with his credit card in 1999 to access a website bearing the message ‘click here for child porn’. Despite his denials of harbouring depraved desires, he accepted a police caution, and was duly placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. His image has never fully recovered, although he did play at the Olympics closing ceremony this summer, along with The Who’s only other surviving original band member, lead singer Roger Daltrey. He has now broken his silence on the issue, as he promotes his new autobiography, Who I Am. Speaking to The Times, Townshend said that he had struggled to express himself in the book because his actions seemed ‘insane’, even to him. He said that when the police raided his home in 2003 after combing through the records of a US company hosting child porn sites, his main concern was just that they would  read his diaries, featuring dilemmas about which yacht or flash car to splash out on, and think he was ‘a self-obsessed prat’. Instead, he found himself condemned as a paedophile around the world. Embroiled: Mr Townshend was one of 3,744 people arrested in the UK as part of Operation Ore, a nationwide police crackdown on internet perverts, but was later cautioned for the incident . Who they were: One of British pop's finest back in 1964, from left to right: . Roger Daltrey, Pete Townsend, Keith Moon and John Entwistle . Still rocking: The Who performed a string of their hits at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony in August. Mr Townshend's memoir is out next week . Speaking out: The Who's Pete Townshend has admitted he was 'insane' to pay to access a child porn site 'purely to see what was there' in 2003 . Asked why he chose not to go to court to . declare his innocence, he said he was simply ‘exhausted’ at the time . and had been given just half an hour by officers at Kingston police . station to decide whether to accept the caution. He said he and his lawyers were ‘surprised’ by the police’s decision because they had all believed he would be let off. He added that he thought prosecution lawyers would ‘****ing rip me apart’ if he went to court. In his autobiography, he describes how the media storm about the scandal began, saying: ‘If I’d had a gun I would have shot myself, just to escape the lynching.’ Asked how seriously he considered suicide, Towns-hend said it was ‘only for a  moment’ but added that he had despaired because he was not given any sense that the truth behind his actions would come out. He added that he had since been plagued by fears that the publicity could lead to baseless further accusations. Townshend explained: ‘Imagine three or four girls coming along and saying, “I had sex with Pete in the Sixties, when he was 25 and I was 12”. I know it didn’t happen, but when you’re a pop star people say all kinds of things. ‘I get lots of pictures of children with big noses who claim I’m their dad.’ Keith Richards famously claimed it was 'tiny' in his memoir Life. Now Mick Jagger may be relieved to hear that Pete Townshend has added quite a different description of the Rolling Stone's manhood in new memoir Who I Am. According to The Times, Townshend describes Jagger as 'very well-endowed' after clocking him in loose pyjama-style trousers without any underwear in 1969. Speaking about the revelation, Townshend said: 'I did do that very deliberately. Let’s hope it gets the same amount of publicity second time round. The songwriter said that he had been . seeking to help victims of sexual abuse since 1976, which is when he set . up the Double-O charity. In . his autobiography, Towns-hend details how when he was six, his musician . parents sent him from their London home to live with his mentally ill . grandmother Denny in Westgate On Sea, Kent. He claims she was promiscuous and invited a succession of men to the house. He recalled: ‘She wouldn’t let me have a lock on my door, which was terrifying. 'She . had one guy that looked like Adolf Hitler, with a little moustache, his . hair brushed to the side and a withered arm. He would sit me on his lap . and I had to call him Uncle. ‘I . don’t want to say I was sexually abused just because it’s convenient to . explain why I’m so ... complicated, but I also don’t want to deny that . what feels to me happened did happen. ‘Not that I was brutally raped, but something very creepy was going on.’ The . experience may have been a spur for ‘wicked Uncle Ernie’, the . disturbing paedophile character in the 1969 Who album and later cult . film, Tommy.

"Latest probe said to have found signs of short-circuiting and overheating . By . Matt Blake . Airbus will drop Lithium-Ion batteries and switch to traditional nickel-cadmium batteries for its new A350 passenger jet in the wake of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's 'exploding battery' mystery. Airbus said it had taken the decision to prevent further delays in initial deliveries of the A350 amid uncertainty over whether investigations into Boeing's battery problems would lead to a regulation overhaul. It comes weeks after all 50 of Boeing's brand new Dreamliners were grounded indefinitely following two on-board fires, believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries. Concerns: The Airbus construction facilities in Hamburg. Airbus said it had taken the decision to prevent further delays in initial deliveries of the A350 amid uncertainty over whether investigations into Boeing's battery problems would lead to changes in regulations .

Airbus will use Lithium-Ion batteries for initial test flights due to start in the summer of 2013 but make the switch to the traditional and slightly heavier nickel-cadmium battery before the plane enters service. French company Saft makes the Lithium-Ion battery that has been ditched for the A350 and supplies traditional nickel-cadmium ones to the rest of Airbus product range. Link: Investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery occured in both incident . Damage: A ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred, frayed and broken . A Saft spokeswoman said on Friday that Airbus was expected to use Saft nickel-cadmium batteries to replace the Lithium-Ion batteries it has been developing. Saft shares were off 0.17 percent at 20.11 euros at 0851 GMT while EADS shares were down 0.43 percent at 34.74 euros.","Comes after Boeing's 787 Dreamliner fleet grounded amid safety concerns .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . She is the fading Southern belle at the centre of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. Now, a London-based theatre critic has revealed that she was the inspiration behind Blanche DuBois. Blanche Marvin, who will turn 90 in two months, claimed the U.S. playwright used both her first and maiden names for the iconic character and her sister in the 1947 Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Inspiration: Theatre critic Blanche Marvin (left) has revealed that she was inspiration behind Tennessee Williams's iconic character Blanche DuBois (portrayed, right, by Vivien Leigh) in A Streetcar Named Desire . She also said an off-the-cuff remark provided him with DuBois's most famous line: 'I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.' 'Tennessee fell in love with my name, . which was then Blanche Zohar,' she said. 'Zohar means ""star"" and the name of the . sister, Stella, also means star. He would take . things out of conversation and would transpose it into a play. That was the . genius of the man.' American-born Ms Marvin, who was awarded an MBE for services to theatre four years ago, is a successful critic who spends most nights attending theatre performances. She became a close friend of Williams in . 1944 after meeting him when he was struggling with rehearsals on . Broadway for his breakthrough play, The Glass Menageries. Playwright: Ms Marvin, who will turn 90 in two months, claimed that Williams (pictured in 1978) used her first name for the main character in the 1947 play. She also said she provided him with DuBois's most famous line . Ms Marvin told The Independent on Sunday the pair were introduced by the play's director Margo Jones, saying: 'We began to talk and there was a real affinity between us. The two of us ended up crying on each other's shoulders.' Explaining how she came to inspire DuBois's iconic line, she added: 'He talked about living in hotel rooms all the time . and was unhappy. He said he was always living with . strangers. I said, ""I've known only kindness from strangers, and so can . you"".' A Street Car Named Desire, which first . opened on Broadway in December 1947, tells the story of fallen DuBois, . who moves into her sister's apartment and is tormented by her brutish . brother-in-law. Play: A new adaptation of the play, starring former X-Files actress Gillian Anderson (pictured), will open at London's Young Vic theatre tomorrow. Ms Marvin will be among the audience. It will run until September 19 . The original 1949 London production starred Vivien Leigh and was directed by Laurence Olivier. A new adaptation will open at London's Young Vic theatre tomorrow.

"By . Jennifer Newton . This is the moment a Turkish woman was left with metal railings through her shoulder after trying to hop over a spiked fence to grab some mulberries. Ceyda Oruk, 35, had been walking with her five-year-old daughter down a street in Adana, a city in the south of Turkey when the little girl spotted the fruit. Ms Oruk then decided to keep her daughter happy by grabbing a handful of the berries but as she climbed over the fence she slipped, impaling herself on the spikes. Ceyda Oruk was left with part of a metal fence stuck in her shoulder after she tried to climb over it to grab some mulberries for her daughter . Emergency workers were unable to free her at the scene and she still had part of the fence in her shoulder when taken to hospital . The mother was left impaled on the fence in the grounds of a school in Adana, southern Turkey for 20 minutes before rescue workers arrived . The mother was left impaled for 20 minutes before rescue workers arrived and realised it would be difficult and dangerous to remove her there and then from the fence. In the end they were then forced to cut the post free and send her in an ambulance with a section of the fence still attached to her arm. Ms Oruk explained: ‘My daughter spotted the mulberries and she really likes them and asked me if I could get some. Rescue workers help to free Ms Oruk, but they soon realised it would be difficult and dangerous to remove her there and then from the fence . Ms Oruk said the experience was agony adding that she couldn't scream as she didn't want to scare her daughter . The railings were eventually removed from the woman's shoulder in hospital, where she is recovering and is in good health . ‘All the ones that you could reach from . the road had been grabbed, but I realised if I hopped over the fence I . could probably grab a handful to keep her happy. ‘But the bars were really close together and I slipped, and suddenly found myself impaled on the spikes. ‘It was agony, but I couldn't scream because it didn't want to scare my daughter any more than she already was. I tried to be brave and told her not to worry, and managed to get my mobile phone and call for help.’ The accident happened near the grounds of a school in the Ismail Safa Ozler Anadolu Lisesi neighbourhood and teaching staff were able to console the young girl during her mother’s ordeal. The woman was taken to hospital where the railings were removed and according to doctors, she is in good health and is likely to be released within 24 hours.","Ceyda Oruk tried to hop over fence to grab some mulberries on other side .

"By . Mark Prigg . The 'eyes' of the laser weapon, which can track an object the size of a bullet, and hit a drone from two miles away . One of the most powerful laser weapons ever fired has successfully shot drones out of the sky from two miles away. The groundbreaking weapon uses a high powered 50kW laser, and is powerful enough to cut through a steel girder from 1km away, yet accurate enough to hit a target the size of a mortar round. Rheinmetall Defence, the firm who developed it, say it could eventually become commonplace on the battlefield, and are developing a smaller version that could be taken to the front line to protect troops. The latest test was conducted at Rheinmetall’s . Ochsenboden Proving Groud (EZO) in Switzerland, in snowy conditions and . blinding sunlight, and engineers are already drawing up plans to double the power of the laser before its next test. 'The demonstration delivered compelling evidence for the 50kW weapon technology,' a spokesman said. 'A . massive, 15mm-thick steel girder was cut through at a distance of 1,000 . metres, and the successful shooting down of several nose-diving target . drones at a range of two kilometres formed the second major highlight.' The team were also able to use the system to track and blow up a ball bearing the size of a mortar round. 'A steel ball measuring 82 mm in diameter . and travelling at approximately 50 m/sec, the target replicated a mortar . round, the firm said. 'The Skyguard fire control unit immediately detected the target, . followed by mechanical tracking with the 30kW laser weapon station. 'At . this point, the BFU of the laser weapon module took over, optically . tracking the target, which was then engaged and destroyed in flight, . leaving no doubt as to the tactical viability of using laser weapons.' The system is currently mounted of a series of large metal containers. However, the firm is developing a smaller, portable version that could easily be transported to the battlefront. The system uses a radar detection system called Skyguard to spot targets and track them. Once the target is acquired, the two laser weapons use their 'beam forming units' to focus and fire the laser beam on a 'fire sector' the system works out. In the most impressive test, the German defence firm used the high-energy laser equipment to shoot fast-moving drones at a distance. The system, which uses two laser weapons combined to form a single beam, was also used to cut through a steel girder a kilometre away. The system used a radar to detect the drones. 'Though they were flying at over 50 metres a second, the Skyguard radar had no trouble detecting the incoming unmanned aerial vehicles at a distance of three kilometres . 'Then the 30kW weapon station used the Skyguard data to carry out rough tracking mechanically.' The optical tracking system in the Beam Forming Units (BFUs) in the individual laser weapon modules performed fine tracking of the UAVs. After reaching the programmed fire sector the laser weapon modules engaged the UAVs immediately and destroyed the incoming UAVs within a few seconds. The third highlight: detection, pursuit and successful engagement of an extremely small ballistic target. One of the two laser systems used in the test, which are powerful enough to cut a steel girder from 1,000m away .","High powered laser is powerful enough to cut through a steel girder from 1km away .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . CNN was attacked last night for broadcasting a picture of Baroness Thatcher with paedophile Jimmy Savile in its coverage of the former prime minister’s death. The U.S. broadcaster used an image from February 1980 of the disgraced BBC DJ presenting her with a cheque for £10,000 in aid of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Global TV networks broadcasted tributes yesterday to Lady Thatcher, who died aged 87 following a stroke in bed at the Ritz Hotel in central London, where she had been staying since after Christmas. Report blunder: CNN used a 1980 image of paedophile Jimmy Savile presenting Baroness Thatcher with a cheque for £10,000 in aid of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children . But the unfortunate image was captured by Neal Mann, New York-based social media editor of the Wall Street Journal, and posted on his Twitter feed - before it was retweeted more than 4,000 times. He said at 1:20pm UK time, shortly after Baroness Thatcher's death was announced at 12:48pm: 'Oh dear someone at CNN obviously didn't get the memo - runs obit pic of Thatcher with Jimmy Savile.' Donal Blaney, CEO of campaign group Conservative Way Forward, said on Twitter: 'Next time you are told Fox News is biased, just remember what tawdry CNN did to Margaret Thatcher yesterday.' Other Twitter users described the image's use on CNN Starting Point as 'ridiculous' and 'not ideal'. A CNN spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on the matter from MailOnline. Spot: The unfortunate image was captured by Neal Mann, New York-based social media editor of the Wall Street Journal, and posted on his Twitter feed - before it was retweeted more than 4,000 times . Last December a letter thought to mark the beginning of the warm relationship between Lady Thatcher and Savile was made public, but other correspondence between the pair was censored. The Top Of The Pops presenter sent an adoring letter to the then prime minister in 1980, singing her praises and declaring his love for her. She responded by inviting the now-disgraced DJ to lunch at Chequers, spending 11 consecutive New Year’s Eves with him and overseeing his knighthood. The letter, part of a Savile file released under the 30-year rule by the National Archives at Kew, revealed how well connected to the establishment he was. More than 450 people have made allegations of abuse by the DJ, who died in October 2011 aged 84.","CNN used 1980 image of Savile presenting Thatcher with NSPCC cheque .

"By . Alex Greig . The Justice Department wants to seize money paid to convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort, the real-life Wolf of Wall Street, for the rights to his story. The former stockbroker was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to his victims as part of his sentencing in 2003, but so far, he has paid just $11.6 million - and most of that came from sales of his property. Red Granite Productions paid Belfort, 51, $1.045 million for the rights to his story in 2011. But according to government documents, Belfort paid just $21,000 in restitution that year. Cashing in: Jordan Belfort was paid handsomely for the rights to his story and claims to have handed the whole amount over in restitution to his victims - a claim the government refutes . Belfort served 22 months of a four-year prison sentence for securities violations. Upon his release, he was ordered to pay 50 per cent of his gross income in restitution. According to Belfort himself, he hasn't profited from his story. 'I am not making any royalties off the film or the books, and I am totally content with that. My income comes from new life, which is far better than my old one,' Belfort wrote on his Facebook page on December 29. 'For the record, I am not turning over 50% of the profits of the books and the movie, which was what the government had wanted me to do. Instead, I insisted on turning over 100% of the profits of both books and the movie, which is to say, I am not making a single dime on any of this. This should amount to countless millions of dollars and hopefully be more than enough to pay back anyone who is still out there,' he added. New career: The former stockbroker owes victims $110 million and should be paying 50 per cent of his income as a public speaker in restitution . Prosecutors say Belfort is living off book royalties, the money from the film rights and fees from his burgeoning career as a motivational speaker. In addition, say prosecutors, Belfort has skipped the country to Australia, complicating the government's efforts to track his income. 'We want to set the record straight,' Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn told the Wall Street Journal. 'Belfort's making these claims, and they're not factual. He's in Australia and using that loophole to avoid paying.' 'The government has seen nothing to suggest that even 100 per cent of Belfort's profits from his book and the movie Wolf of Wall Street would yield, in his words, ""countless millions,"" much less the approximately $100 million that is still owed to the victims,' he said. Belfort's lawyer denies that charge, saying his client traveled to Australia for work reasons but lives in Manhattan Beach, California. Dispute: Prosecutors say Belfort and his partner have relocated to Australia to avoid paying back what he owes, but his lawyer says the pair are based in California . Belfort's Facebook page tells a different story: photographs appear on his page dated from April 10 2013 through May and June. He then appears to head to London and Los Angeles before arriving back in Australia in November, where he's apparently spent most of his time up until now. His most recent posts all come from Melbourne, Australia. The U.S. government contends that . Belfort must continue to pay 50 per cent of his income in restitution, . but Belfort's lawyer says he is no longer obligated to comply with . the court-ordered payment plan because his supervised release period is . now over. Belfort's lawyer, Nicholas De Feis, told the Wall Street Journal that his client has paid every restitution payment he owes. Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, in which he is played by Leonard Dicaprio, is now being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s . 'He's made payments as he was required to make payments and as he earned income,' said De Feis. 'He has never run from his obligations.' Prosecutors went public with their frustrations this week after Belfort's claims on Facebook. They have asked the court to hold him in default. The Hollywood Reporter reveals that Belfort has also been shopping around a reality television series - which could cause further financial disputes if picked up. The Wolf of Wall Street documents Belfort's time at the Stratton Oakmont brokerage house in the 1990s. He was eventually convicted of money laundering and securities fraud. Last night, Leonardo DiCaprio won a Best Actor Golden Globe award for his portrayal of Belfort at the height of his Wall Street career.","Jordan Belfort was paid $1.045 million for the rights to his memoir, The Wolf of Wall Street .

"By . Ollie Gillman . A couple 'taking a selfie' on the edge of a cliff died when they fell hundreds of feet while their young children watched. The Polish couple died after falling from the rocky edge in Cabo da Raca, west Portugal. Police say the pair, who are yet to be named, may have been trying to take a photo of themselves moments before they fell. The children, aged five and six, saw their parents fall to their deaths 'while taking a selfie' The cliffs at Cabo da Roca, where the pair fell, are known for their fantastic views of the Atlantic Ocean . The couple's children, aged five and six, witnessed the accident and are now undergoing psychiatric care. The parents apparently crossed a safety barrier in order to reach the cliff edge, but the police are still investigating their final moments. Captain Dario Pinto Moreira, who is in charge of the port at nearby Cascais, told Portuguese news channel CMTV that the Poles slipped. Emergency services were alerted on Saturday evening by a Spanish couple, but attempts to recover the bodies were suspended until Sunday because of the rising tide. Monika Dulian, Poland's consul in Lisbon, said the family had lived in Portugal for several years. Relatives have been informed and are on their way to Portugal. The couple are believed to have crossed a safety barrier before attempting to take a photo of themselves . Emergency services had to wait overnight for the tide to go out before recovering the two bodies . The couple would not be the first to die while taking a photograph of themselves. Russian 17-year-old Xenia Ignatyeva plunged 30ft to her death as she climbed on a railway bridge to take a selfie. She fell and was hit by 1,500 volts when she tried to grab live electrical wires. Similarly, Italian teenager Isabella Fracchiolla fell 60ft on to jagged rocks while trying to take a selfie on a seafront in the town of Taranto, in south-eastern Italy. The 16-year-old schoolgirl suffered serious injuries and could not be saved by doctors.","Polish couple fall to their deaths while taking photo by Portuguese cliff edge .

"By . Sara Malm . While his country is reeling from a military coup, the heir to the throne of Thailand is hiding out in a five-star hotel in a quiet village in Hampshire. Maha Vajiralongkorn, 61, only son to 86-year-old King Bhumibol, arrived at Tylney Hall in Rotherwick a week ago, before the army, in which he holds the rank of general, overthrew the Thai government. Taking over a wing of the extravagant hotel, where rooms start at £250-a-night, the crown prince has brought an entourage of 'about 30', including several guards and security staff. Scroll down for video . Royal stay: Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 61, only son and heir to the frail 86-year-old King Bhumibol, arrived with an entourage of 30 at Tylney Hall in Hampshire last week . Did he know? Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, a general in the Thai Army that now rules the country, has been staying at the luxury hotel since before the coup . Riding it out: Rooms at the extravagant five-star 18th century hotel starts at £250 per night for the cheapest alternative, and the prince has taken over a whole wing . The prince arrived at the Hampshire luxury hotel with what has been described as ‘hundreds of boxes’ several days before the military took charge of Thailand in a non-violent coup on Thursday. A marquee has been set up in the gravel car park in front of Tylney Hall in order to provide cover for two top-of-the-range Mercedes, assumed to be belonging to the prince – one has the number plate THAI 1. ‘The Thai prince is staying here, he has about 30 people with him,’ a hotel employee confirmed to the Evening Standard. ‘We have hardly seen them as they have been very private. They are staying for ten days. ‘ . Meanwhile, the Thai junta has banned more than 150 prominent political figures from leaving the country, as it attempts to bring order after Thursday’s coup - but one group in particular is unimpressed with their establishment of martial law.

Others complained about the TV broadcasts, with parents asking for the return of children's channels: ‘Can I have my TV back? At least the cartoon channel for my kid? It won't hurt national stability,’ said one father. Thai military staged its second coup in eight years on Thursday, suspending the constitution and the Cabinet. On Friday it summoned the former prime minster Takshin Shinawatra, who was sacked by the Constitutional Court earlier this month for nepotism, her replacement and more than 100 others to report to ta military compound in central Bangkok. The military said it was summoning the high-profile figures ‘to keep peace and order and solve the country's problems’, however, CNN correspondent Saima Mohsin, reported that the military had 'summoned foreign diplomats and banned 155 politicians and activists from leaving the country' under threat of arrest. The new martial law rules, which includes banning gatherings of more than five people and a nationwide curfew between 10pm and 5am, applies to both tourists and Thais and breaking them results in immideate arrest, the military has warned. For seven months, anti-government protesters have been calling for the removal of the powerful Shinawatra family and its alleged corrupting influence from Thai politics. Ms Shinawatra and her temporary replacement Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, arrived at the army compound in Bangkok by midday Friday, Yingluck's aide confirmed.

A pro-government protester points at a soldier during a cleanup at a pro-government demonstration site on the outskirts of Bangkok today . The international community, including the United States, Japan and Australia expressed concern and disappointment over the coup, with the U.S. saying there was ‘no justification’ for the takeover. The coup was launched Thursday while the military hosted a meeting of political rivals for what was billed as a second round of talks on how to resolve the country's political deadlock. After two hours of inconclusive talks, armed soldiers detained the participants, including four Cabinet ministers, and army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha appeared on national television to announce the takeover. General Prayuth justified the coup as a necessary move to restore stability and ‘quickly bring the situation back to normal’ amid increasing spasms of violence that together with controversial court rulings had rendered the government powerless and the country profoundly divided between the wealthy urban elite who disdain the Shinawatra family and their supporters among the rural poor majority. The military suspended the constitution and the Cabinet and banned gatherings of more than five people — a risky bid to end half a year of political upheaval that many fear will only deepen the nation's crisis. Thursday's dramatic events were the latest response to a societal schism laid bare after the 2006 coup deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck and a billionaire tycoon whose populist movement has won every national election since 2001. Thaksin lives in self-imposed exile to avoid corruption charges, but he still wields enormous influence over Thailand's political affairs and remains at the heart of the ongoing crisis. It is a divide that has led to upheaval multiple times in recent years. The latest crisis alone has left 28 people dead and more than 800 wounded since November.

"By . Sean Poulter . A 33-year-old Royal Navy veteran has died after drinking a pear drink manufactured in the Caribbean which contained a lethal amount of cocaine. Joromie Lewis, of Gosport, Hampshire, became ill immediately after drinking the pear fruit drink in Southampton. He died within hours at Southampton General Hospital on December 5. Killed: Joromie Lewis who died after drinking a pear drink manufactured in the Caribbean which contained a lethal amount of cocaine . A Hampshire police spokesman said that one of its lines of inquiries was that the drink had been used to smuggle cocaine into the UK in a liquid form. Drug traffickers often try to smuggle cocaine as a liquid because the powder form is highly soluble. Half a kilogram can be diluted into a litre of water. It is then easily returned to its original state as 90 per cent can be decantered and filtered. Drugs . authorities in different countries have found liquid cocaine smuggled . in tins of pineapples, coconut milk, tequila and even soaked into . clothes . In May . 2009, a 63-year-old taxi driver, Lascell Malcolm, from Haringey, north . London, died after he drank from a bottle of Bounty Rum which had been . used to smuggle cocaine into the country. The . father-of-two, who had been given the bottle as a present in lieu of . payment from an unknowing friend, died after drinking from the bottle . that had been used to smuggle 246g (8.7 oz) of pure cocaine dissolved . into the alcohol. Just a teaspoon of the liquid could be fatal. Drug . smuggler Martin Newman of Romford in Essex, aged 50 at the time of his . conviction in 2010, was convicted of Mr Malcolm's manslaughter at . Croydon Crown Court and sentenced to 20 years to run concurrently with . 15 years for the importation of cocaine. Later . in 2010, scientists from the Universities of Bradford and Leeds . developed a portable laser light, called a Raman, which can detect the . presence of cocaine through glass and was hoped could help prevent the . drug being smuggled into the country in this manner. Customs officials otherwise have to open bottles to test for cocaine. Mr Lewis' widow, Jayrusha Lewis, said her husband was a 'selfless and devoted family man'. She said: 'Joromie Lewis was a Royal Navy veteran, originally from St Vincent and the Grenadines. 'He was a devoted family-oriented man with a selfless attitude to help others, and always knew the right words and advice to give. 'His exemplary conduct and actions touched the lives and hearts of many. 'He was a member of the Bridgemary Family Church.' A Hampshire police spokeswoman said: 'It appears from police inquiries that Mr Lewis ingested a small amount of liquid in the belief he was drinking a genuine pear drink.' A post-mortem examination was carried out on Saturday, December 7. The results are inconclusive and toxicology tests are being carried out. The spokeswoman continued: 'On Wednesday, December 11 police received laboratory test results which showed that the liquid in the juice bottle contained a lethal amount of cocaine. 'Police now have established that the bottle of Cole Cold Pear D fruit drink was manufactured in the Caribbean and the company did not export this drink to the UK.' The Food Standards Agency said: ‘The presence of cocaine renders the product a very serious health risk. This makes the product unsafe for consumption.’ The product packaging lists the manufacturer's name as S.M. Jaleel & Co Ltd, Otaheite, Trinidad. However, the company has said that the Cole Cold Pear-D product has not been exported to the UK and that the label was last produced in September 2013 for the local Caribbean market. Despite investigations by the enforcement authorities, it has not yet been possible to obtain any distribution details for this product. Investigations are ongoing. An investigation has been launched by Hampshire police. The Food Standards Agency has issued an alert to all local authorities to contact retailers to withdraw Pear D if it is found. Drink: Cole Cold Pear D fruit drink manufactured in the Caribbean which contained a lethal amount of cocaine . Detective Superintendent Richard Pearson, who is leading the police investigation called Operation Crab, said: 'We are working closely with partner agencies, including Southampton's Regulatory Services, Public Health England, the Food Standards Agency and other law enforcement agencies, including the National Crime Agency, to minimise any risk to the public and to investigate the circumstances leading to the tragic death of Mr Lewis. 'We are supporting his family and linking closely with public health departments. 'We have taken clear advice from partner agencies and, in light of the analysis of the contents of the bottle, a decision was made to issue the public alert by the Food Standards Agency. 'Inquiries to date have not identified any further incidents or similar bottles. 'The investigation suggests that this was likely to be a rogue bottle from a consignment of drugs stored in plastic juice bottles. 'If anyone finds a bottle of Pear D juice, do not open the bottle. 'If sealed, the bottle is perfectly safe. Take the bottle to the nearest police station, and we will examine the contents if appropriate.' Anyone who finds they have a bottle of Pear-D should take it to their local police station and are advised to contact the Food Standards Agency on 020 7276 8448.","Joromie Lewis became ill immediately after drinking the pear drink .

"By . Harriet Arkell . When identical twin sisters Darlene and Diane Nettemeier went to a twins' festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, one man stood out by himself amongst the sea of twins. Tall, dark and handsome Mark Sanders caught their eye, but there was only one of him and two of them. Luckily for them, Mr Sanders was also a twin, and he called his identical brother, Craig, down from their hotel room to meet the 'neat' blondes. Instant attraction: The twins (Craig and Diane are left) said they fell for each other immediately when they met in Twinsburg, Ohio . Soon afterwards, the pairs of twins fell in love, got married, and then went on to produce another set of identical twins. Now the Sanders family - Craig and Diane, and Mark and Darlene - live in houses next door to each other in Texas, and have five children between them. Today they appeared on a U.S. talk show to discuss talk about their unusual family set-up. Craig, 44, said that he felt an 'instant attraction' to just one of the blonde twins, Darlene, despite them looking the same. Fateful day: The twins when they met at Twin Day festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, in 1998 . Double dating: The two sets of twins both spend a night out together . 'When I went downstairs I was instantly attracted to the one on the right. Diane was standing on the right and Darlene was standing on the left and I was instantly attracted to Diane,' he said on the Jeff Probst show. After meeting in 1998, the boys went to visit the girls at their home in St. Louis, Missouri, and took them on a double date to a baseball game.

The two couples hit it off, got engaged on the same day, and decided to share a wedding. 'We had a double wedding and Darlene and I decided that we wanted to wear the same dress and then our dad walked us both down the aisle at the same time,' Diane said. The families built their houses on . adjoining plots and took out the fence between the two to create one . enormous garden that they could all share.

"By . Sophie Tedmanson . A Japanese man who has spent more than 45 years on death row will this week have a new appeal heard which could possibly lead to a retrial. Hakamada Iwao, who was once a professional boxer, was sentenced to death for the murders of four people – his boss and the man’s family – by the the Shizuoka District Court in 1968. Now 77, he is believed to be the world’s longest serving death row inmate, having spent more than half of his life in prison including 30 years in solitary confinement waiting to die. The court ordered a retrial for Mr Hakamada, a former professional boxer, who was sentenced to death in 1968 . There has long been speculation Hakamada was innocent, and in 2007 one of the three judges who originally convicted him publicly declared he had thought Hakamada was innocent. Amnesty International claims new DNA tests undertaken in 2012 point to Hakamada’s innocence. A spokeswoman said a hearing is expected to begin in Japan later this week to decide whether or not there will be a retrial. A decision is expected by the end of March. Amid news of the new hearing, a rally was held in Japan earlier this week involving some well-known local personalities and Mr Hakamada’s 80-year-old sister Hideko, who has spent decades speaking out on behalf of her brother’s plight. Waiting to die: Iwao Hakamada has spent 30 years in solitary confinement during his time behind bars . In an interview last year Hideko Hakamada said she was worried about the mental state of her brother, who now ‘talks nonsense’. ‘What I am worried about most is Iwao's health. If you put someone in jail for 47 years, it's too much to expect them to stay sane,’ Hideko Hakamada told AFP last year. She added: ‘I truly believe Iwao didn't do it. But once police suspect you for a crime, that's the end of the story. It was like that back then, it is like that now.’ Japan carries out a handful of executions every year. Japan's 134 death-row inmates are usually confined to their cell with little or no contact with other inmates. Prisoners are typically notified about their impending deaths just hours before they are hanged, and their families are told only after the execution. Sara Saleh, spokeswoman for Amnesty International Australia, said Hakamada’s supporters are hopeful that a retrial will be granted. ‘Imagine making history by having this overturned, it would be great,’ Ms Saleh said. ‘For a man who has been waiting to die for 45 years, we have some serious concerns for his mental health and that he has spent so many years in solitary confinement. Despite all of that though we are extremely hopeful with this development.’","Hakamada Iwao was sentenced to death in Japan for four murders in 1968 .

"By . Lee Moran . Updated: . 14:29 GMT, 16 February 2012 . The three bungling Iranian bombers detained in Bangkok after they accidentally set off their explosives were planning to attack Israeli diplomats, Thailand's top policeman has revealed. It is the first time Thai officials have confirmed the group, including one man who blew his leg off when a bomb bounced back at his feet after he threw it at police, was plotting attacks in the country. The allegation came after days of accusations by Israel that Iran was behind the botched plot as well as two others in India and the former Soviet republic of Georgia this week.  Iran has denied the charges. Marked men: CCTV of the three Iranians, before they were caught with explosives in their Bangkok home . Mistake: Iranian Saeid Moradi, who is still alive, had his legs blown off after a grenade he hurled bounced back onto him, as police closed in on him outside a Bangkok school . But citing the similarity of bombs used in New Delhi and Tbilisi, national police chief General Prewpan Dhamapong said Thai authorities now 'know for certain that (the target) was Israeli diplomats'. He said: 'This issue was about individuals and the targets were specific. This was something personal.' Israel has accused Iran of waging a covert campaign of state terror and has threatened military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran has blamed the Jewish state for the recent killings of Iranian atomic scientists and has denied responsibility for all three bomb plots, including an explosion on Monday in New Delhi that tore through an Israeli diplomatic vehicle, wounding the driver and a diplomat's wife, and a foiled attempt the same day in Georgia. Detained: Mohammad Hazaei (centre) speaks to police after he was arrested at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on Tuesday night . Explosion: Bomb disposal experts work on the Bangkok house rented by three Iranian men, which was blown up on Tuesday . Israel's Foreign Ministry said today it has stepped up security for diplomats posted overseas. The plot in Bangkok was discovered on Tuesday only by accident, when explosives stored in a house occupied by several Iranian men blew up by mistake. One of the Iranians, Mohammad Kharzei, was paraded before journalists today wearing a striped short-sleeve shirt, his apparently handcuffed hands covered by a dark sheet. Prewpan said Kharzei had 'partially confessed' and acknowledged knowing one of the other suspects, Saeid Moradi, whose leg was sheered off by an explosive he was carrying as he fled police in the Thai capital's busy Sukhumvit Road area. Surveillance video released by police already links the suspects: it shows them leaving their destroyed house just after the first blast. Investigation: A Thai bomb disposal expert analyses the damage following the blasts in Bangkok on Tuesday . Carnage: A bomb disposal expert checks out the damage, which also hit a police car, on Tuesday . Moradi was the last to exit, and as he walked out with a heavy backpack over his shoulder, a small crowd that had begun to gather backed away, clearly terrified. Kharzei, grim-faced, did not speak as he stood before reporters, but Prewpan described him as 'stressed out' and another official said he was having trouble eating. The third Iranian, Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, was detained in Malaysia and police said he was being investigated for terrorism-related activities linked to the Bangkok blasts. A Bangkok court has approved arrest warrants for all three suspects, as well as an Iranian woman named Leila Rohani who rented the destroyed house. However, Rohani has left Thailand and is now in Tehran, according to top immigration police official Lt Gen Wiboon Bangthamai. All four now face criminal charges including possession of explosives, attempted murder, attempted murder of a policeman and causing explosions that damaged property. Warning: Israel and the U.S. have told their citizens to be alert in the capital . Destruction: Saeid Moradi lies on the ground, by a telephone box, after his legs were seriously wounded in the blast . Prewpan said he believed there already was enough evidence to prosecute them. The Israeli ambassador to Thailand, Itzhak Shoham, declined to comment on reports his staff had been specifically targeted. He said the Israeli Embassy was open and functioning as normal. Shoham said earlier this week that the similarity of the bombs found in Bangkok and New Delhi had led Israel to believe the plots were linked. Prewpan also said that two homemade 'sticky' bombs found at the blast site on Tuesday matched the devices planted on Israeli diplomatic cars in India and Georgia a day earlier. Thailand's acknowledgement that terror attacks were being planned on its soil stood in contrast to its denials of that last month, when police arrested a Lebanese-Swedish man with alleged links to Hezbollah. At the time, authorities insisted Thailand was only being used as a staging ground for attacks, but was not the target. Fireball: The Bangkok blasts came the day after Israeli diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also blamed on Iran. A bomb attached magnetically to a car in the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli official and two bystanders . Closer examination: Indian security and forensic officials examine the car on Monday - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately blamed Iran for the attacks . The man led police to a warehouse near Bangkok packed with more than 4,000kilos of fertiliser and other materials that could be used to make bombs. After that incident, Israel and the United States warned their citizens to be alert. The U.S. Embassy said foreign terrorists may have been looking to attack tourist areas in Bangkok and Thai media reported the attacks were aimed at Israeli targets, including the Israeli Embassy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the violence. 'If this aggression isn't halted, ultimately it will spread to many other countries,' Netanyahu said in Israel's parliament. He convened his Security Cabinet to discuss terrorism against Israel and 'Iran's involvement in repeated attempts to attack Israeli targets,' his office said. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast called the allegations baseless and said Israel was trying to damage his country's relations with Thailand and fuel conspiracy theories. Iran has blamed the Jewish state for the recent killings of Iranian atomic scientists.","First time Thai officials confirm group was plotting attacks in country .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Grand Theft Auto V, one of the most eagerly-anticipated video game releases is expected to smash sales records after going on sale worldwide today. Stores across the UK opened their doors at midnight for the special launch of Grand Theft Auto V, which reportedly cost around £170 million to make and market and retails at £35. Online seller Amazon has already sold out of the game and copies have started appearing . on eBay, with some sellers asking in excess of £90 for the standard . version and £170 for the Collector's Edition. Scroll down for video . Awfully popular: One day after its release, Grand Theft Auto V had made a record $800 million in sales . Zohair Ali from London, pictured, was the first in the queue to pick up a copy of Grand Theft Auto V at the flagship Game store in Westfield Stratford City in London. Gaming site IGN.com discovered that 46 per cent of fans said they booked the day off as holiday to get their hands on the game . Experts estimate it could generate £1 billion during its first year on sale when gamers are predicted to snap up some 25 million copies - breaking current records. Grand Theft Auto V has received rave reviews from critics across the board who have labelled it 'one of the very best video games ever made.' But the launch of the latest iteration in the Grand Theft Auto series has not gone as smoothly as planned. The . Scottish creator Rockstar launched an investigation into whether . copies of the game were dispatched days ahead of its official release. Some gamers claimed to have received their copies as early as Friday following Amazon deliveries. Fans expressed their delight on Twitter where one user wrote: 'Thank you Mum and Amazon GTA 5 here today. So excited.' MailOnline's gaming expert Talal Musa awarded the game five stars: 'This is clearly a well-thought-out and . intelligent title - a far cry from the meaningless violence many wrongly . (and unfairly) infer from its 'Grand Theft Auto' label. 'The visuals excel in both art design and graphical fidelity. From deep-sea diving to dog fighting . in the skies, every inch of GTA V's world has been given equal, . immaculate care and attention. 'Every . excursion is a surprise, and coupled with an improved check-pointing . mechanism - you're now no longer punished for attempting missions in . different ways. 'Cars all 'feel' different, and have . lost the wayward steering that plagued the last game. Missions no longer stick to the oft . rigid GTA formula of driving somewhere and shooting something.' Stuff Magazine's Guy Cocker wrote: 'Grand Theft Auto V aims ridiculously high and despite those ethical missteps manages to deliver on all of its towering ambitions. 'It’s a game that pushes the boundaries not only of what’s possible in open world games, but what’s possible on the current generation of consoles. 'In GTA V, the incredibly detailed world, compelling characters and varied missions combine to create an experience that will live on in your memory long after you've finished playing.' The Metro's David Jenkins added: 'A staggering technical achievement that is matched only by the depth and ambition of its gameplay – this is not only the best-looking GTA ever but by far the most fun to play. 'Impossibly good visuals, in terms of scope and attention to detail. Excellent and varied mission design. Great car handling and much improved gunplay. Yet wasn't entirely positive: 'The story is as vague and meandering as usual, with not a single virtuous character in the whole cast. Gunplay could still be better and helicopters are a pain.' Keza MacDonald, games editor at . IGN.com, said: 'Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously . enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire . of contemporary America,' she added. 'It represents a refinement of . everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It's . technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it's also . tremendously ambitious in its own right. 'No . other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and . there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for . mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story . without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed . adventures through San Andreas. Another . joked: 'I refuse to disclose whether Amazon has dispatched my pre-order . copy of GTA early in case it prevents them from doing so again in the . future.' Edinburgh-based Rockstar said it was looking into how any copies of the game may have been released early. 'We are in the process of investigating early 'sales' to determine how and why that is occurring,' a spokesman told the Games Industry International website.' In a message on its website, Amazon warned any orders placed after last Friday may not arrive until after today's release date because of high demand. 'Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox 360)--Stock Update. Please note--due to high demand, orders placed for Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox 360) from September 13 will be shipped as soon as we receive inventory.' Around a quarter of the poll participants who owned gaming devices said they were likely to buy Grand Theft Auto V, pictured, when the new consoles come out. While 22 per cent said they would pick up a copy of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Ghosts game . Rockstar released Grand Theft Auto V worldwide on Tuesday. This billboard is on the side of the Figueroa Hotel in Los Angeles . Tom Butler, social media editor of gaming site IGN.com, said thousands of workers have taken the day off for the launch or plan on calling in sick. 'Grand Theft Auto V will be the biggest entertainment launch of the year and possibly all-time with levels of consumer anticipation outstripping Harry Potter and Twilight,' he said. 'With gamers queuing at midnight to be among the first to play and the developer boasting thousands of hours of game play, there's no surprise that we're likely to see an outbreak of GTA flu this September.' Shoppers arrive at HMV in Wimbledon, London, to buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto V at midnight. Copies of the game are already selling on eBay in excess of £90, despite retailing for £35 . The gaming site polled 10,995 readers to ask whether they would take time off work today when the GTA V goes on sale. According to its findings, 5,059 readers (46 per cent) said they booked the day off as holiday. Another 2,012 (19 per cent) said they would phone in claiming to be unwell while 3,884 (35 per cent) said they would wait to get their hands on the game. The Grand Theft Auto series has accumulated sales of 135 million copies since its 1997 debut. GTA IV has reportedly sold more than 25 million copies since its 2008 release.","Amazon warns pre-orders will be delayed due to stock shortages .

"By . Rebecca Evans for the Daily Mail . Rick Parfitt has told how he came an ‘inch away from dying’ of a heart attack that has convinced him to finally tame his hard-living ways. The Status Quo guitarist, 65, was still drinking a bottle of wine a day and smoking 30 cigarettes, despite a long line of serious health scares. But it was not until he suffered his second heart attack three weeks ago that the father of two young twins finally received the wake-up call he needed to give up alcohol and cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Rick Parfitt, with his wife Lyndsay and twins Tommy, left and Lily Rose, right, pictured at home in Spain . ‘I’ve made a pact with myself,’ he said. ‘That part of my life is over as I do not want to die, I want to live.’ Speaking for the first time about the ordeal, Parfitt described how he was lying alone in the cabin of his luxury tour bus near the Croatian city of Pula when he felt the first telltale pains in his chest. It had been less than eight hours since the multimillionaire had finished a sell-out gig in Austria and in that time he had drunk a bottle of wine and smoked ten cigarettes. ‘I was an inch away from dying,’ he said. ‘I remember the bus stopping at about 4.30am in the middle of nowhere and I started to feel very ill. ‘I felt a terrible pain, in my chest and down both arms and across my shoulders. I didn’t know if it was a heart attack or not but I suspected it was. It felt like an elephant starting to sit on your chest. ‘You don’t know whether you’re going to die or not. You lay there in incredible pain not knowing what to do with yourself. There’s no relief, you just hope you don’t die, because I was lying there dying I guess.’ Parfitt – who had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, a throat cancer scare in 2005 and his first heart attack in 2011 – managed to wake up his personal assistant Paul Ashcroft, who called an ambulance. Before his last heart attack, the 65-year-old was still smoking 20 cigarettes a day and drinking a bottle of wine . The musician, who along with Francis Rossi helped found the hugely successful British rock band 47 years ago, was taken to a local hospital before being flown back to the UK in a private jet for emergency surgery. While on the operating table, he had another heart attack. It meant Status Quo, who have had a string of hits including Rockin’ All Over The World and opened the Live Aid concert in 1985, were forced to cancel a number of gigs across Europe. Parfitt, who lives in Marbella with his third wife Lyndsay, 54, and six-year-old twins Lily and Tommy, said: ‘I’ve had 50 years of smoking and drinking and abusing my body. ‘There comes a time when you have to look at yourself and think, “Right, that’s it, it’s now time for a change”. All my life I’ve defied the doctor’s orders, thinking that I’m made of steel. Rick Parfitt, pictured with his first wife Marietta, left and his second wife Patie, right, at Live Aid . ‘But as stupid as this may sound, I’m pleased I’ve had this heart attack because I couldn’t see a way out of my bad habits.’ Parfitt enjoyed a hedonistic lifestyle throughout most of his years as a rock star – at one point spending £1,000 a week on cocaine and drinking at least a bottle of vodka a day. He stopped taking drugs 11 years ago but continued to smoke and drink heavily, even after having a stent fitted three years ago. He was released from hospital four days after falling ill on August 2 and was due to perform a few days later. But at the insistence of his doctor, Parfitt pulled out of the gig. Speaking from a boutique hotel in Kingston, Surrey, he said: ‘It was the first time ever that I’ve missed a gig and it was a very odd feeling because even though I wasn’t there, I lived the gig in my mind.’ Parfitt, right, with his third wife Lyndsay, said he has not touched a drop of alcohol in three weeks . Parfitt has now abstained from alcohol or cigarettes for three weeks – the longest time since the age of 15 – and he says he has never felt better. ‘There are so many advantages I never realised to being sober,’ he added. ‘When I wake up in the morning I want to get up and get the day going and I can’t tell you how much better I feel. ‘My wife has been begging me to sort myself out, telling me “You’re going to die if you don’t stop”. I realise now for the first time in my life that if I carry on I will die. I don’t regret the things I’ve done but I look back and it’s incredibly frightening the way I’ve lived my life. ‘In the light of sobriety now, sitting at home in Spain with my feet up out on the terrace on lovely warm evenings, thinking, “God, you just didn’t realise”.’ ‘I’ve always loved the fun side of life and had a good sense of humour and the fact you don’t drink doesn’t separate you from your natural sense of humour.’ The musician, who is performing tonight with Status Quo in Norfolk, added: ‘I’m going to enjoy my life so much more now. I’m ready to rock, I can’t wait.’ Status Quo tour the UK in December. Tickets are on sale from LiveNation.","Rick Parfitt was smoking 30 cigarettes a day and downing a bottle of wine .

"By . Martin Robinson . Row: Rihanna is said to be threatening to sue Topshop over the use of her face on a popular T-shirt . Rihanna is threatening to sue Topshop after claiming they sold T-shirts with her face on it without asking permission. The superstar's team is said to have told the high street clothing chain run by billionaire Sir Phillip Green to stop selling them, and is reported to be asking for £3million in compensation at the High Court. The legal threat comes despite the What's My Name singer having dined with Sir Philip and music mogul Simon Cowell while on her Christmas break to Barbados in 2010. The star, who last year signed a deal worth a rumoured £800,000 to design a range with High Street rival River Island, tweeted about the Boxing Day meal they had together, saying: 'Just had dinner w/ Simon Cowell Philip Green @ Sandy Lane! Great night!' She has also spent time with Sir Philip's daughter Chloe while holidaying at the same time in the Caribbean two years ago. It was even rumoured she might follow in the footsteps of Kate Moss and design a range for Topshop, but the two parties could now face each other in court. Last year Topshop released a T-shirt featuring a picture of Rihanna from her 'We Found Love' music video, which sold out quickly afterwards. It is understood this is the garment at the centre of the row. In Britain companies could argue that by buying the image from the photographer, they do not have to pay licensing fees to the star pictured. A source close to the singer said the 25-year-old was offered a small . sum of cash and Topshop told her management 'we do what we want', according to Page Six.

'Rihanna’s management asked Topshop a number of times to stop selling her image,' the source said . 'What is most offensive for Rihanna is that they basically told her, ""Go to hell. We don’t care""; we are going to continue selling you. 'Even though the UK laws don’t protect the artist, she has decided to . move forward and sue Topshop. She has spent almost $1 million in . litigation at this point. She says it’s the principle, and wants to make . a statement about it. They are taking advantage of artists. It is just . exploitation. What they are doing is wrong.' Row: Rihanna is said to have instructed a British law firm to deal with the case with Topshop on her behalf, as she says they should pay to use her image . Topshop is a British retail powerhouse which is trying to expand in America, setting up stores in New York, and said it would not comment today. But a company source said: 'This issue is related to a T-shirt provided to Topshop by a third party supplier. 'We have been informed that the claimants documents do not mention any specific level of financial damages so any numbers referenced are fictitious'.","Pop superstar is said to have claimed Topshop should pay to use her image .

He was arrested and taken to Lithgow Police Station, where a breath analysis returned an alleged reading of 0.133. He was charged with mid-range PCA and booked for not properly restrained, child not restrained as prescribed, and not displaying P plates on his vehicle. His driver's licence was also suspended. When questioned by Channel Nine News outside the court room on Thursday Matthews wasn’t so sure of the amount he had consumed. ‘I don’t know - a fair whack the night before,’ Matthews said.

"By . Sean Poulter . Updated: . 01:11 EST, 21 October 2011 . GM crops have failed to deliver higher food yields but have created dangerous super weeds, a report warns. Health and conservation groups from Africa, Asia and Latin America say that the fast-growing weeds smother other crops planted in fields near where GM crops have been grown. GM crops were first sold in the U.S. about 15 years ago, and are now grown in 29 countries, over approximately 3.7billion acres. Biohazard: Intensive farming of genetically modified crops is creating dangerous, spray-resistant superweeds, a new study has claimed . Biotech companies have claimed that GM farming will lead to higher food yields, fewer pests and weeds and less chemical use. But Vandana Shiva, head of the Indian organisation Navdanya International, which co-ordinated the report, claims that we are yet to see any benefits. He writes: 'We have been told that genetically modified crops will save the world. However, the GM emperor has no clothes. All of these claims have been established as false over years of experience all across the world.' The Global Citizens' Report on the State of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) refers to American and Australian studies which found that conventional crops outperformed GM crops. It also warns that when crops are modified to withstand herbicides, nearby weeds can develop a resistance to the chemicals. The extremely hardy pigweed, which grows at a rate of an inch per day, is a particular concern. The problem is so severe that farmers . have had to resort to the expense of hiring labourers to tour fields . with scythes to clear them. Franken-food: A farmer shows two corncobs of genetically engineered corn MON810 by U.S. company Monsanto, right, and two normal corncobs. Recent research suggests some of the toxins included in GM food plants have reached the bloodstreams of pregnant women and their unborn babies . The . so-called perfect super-weed is extremely hardy, produces 10,000 seeds . at a time and will smother commercial crops in the same field. Other crops such as maize and cotton have also been altered to make them resistant to certain pests. However, . recent research suggests some of the toxins included in GM food plants . have reached the bloodstreams of pregnant women and their unborn babies. The harms this may cause are not yet known. Expense: Indian farmers work in a paddy field. Indebtedness among them is thought to be a main reason for a high suicide rate in recent years . The authors of the Global Citizens' Report on the State of GMOs said: 'The genetic engineering miracle is quite clearly faltering in farmers' fields.' It said the biggest issue is the greatly increased use of synthetic chemicals as part of the farming regime. The study reported that, in China, where insect-resistant Bt cotton is widely planted, populations of pests have increased 12-fold since 1997. A 2008 study in the International Journal of Biotechnology found that any benefits of planting Bt cotton have been eroded by the increasing use of pesticides needed to combat them. Opposition: A Greenpeace protester sprays milk-based paint on a research soybean field near Atlantic, Iowa, in this October 1996 file photo . It is claimed that pesticide use in India has increased 13-fold since Bt cotton was introduced . And soya growers in Argentina and Brazil have been found to use twice as much herbicide on their GM as they do on conventional crops. The report highlights the fact that GM technology has allowed three biotech firms to gain a stranglehold over large elements of farm production. Monsanto, Dupont and Syngenta, the world's three largest GM companies, now control nearly 70 per cent of global seed sales. This allows them to charge high prices both for seeds and the chemicals used with them. The study accuses Monsanto of gaining control of over 95 per cent of the Indian cotton seed market and pushing up prices. High levels of indebtedness among farmers is thought to be behind many of the 250,000 deaths by suicide of Indian farmers over the past 15 years. Vandana Shiva, director of the Navdanya International, added: 'The GM model of farming undermines farmers trying to farm ecologically. 'Co-existence between GM and conventional crops is not possible because genetic pollution and contamination of conventional crops is impossible to control. 'Choice is being undermined as food systems are increasingly controlled by giant corporations and as chemical and genetic pollution spread. 'GM companies have put a noose round the neck of farmers. They are destroying alternatives in the pursuit of profit.' Dr Mark Buckingham, deputy chairman of the GM industry's Agriculture and Biotechnology Council insisted the technology has huge potential benefits. He said: 'From India to South Africa, millions of farmers already value the positive impact GM technology can have on their operations. 'The world's population is set to reach nine billion by 2050. Significant increases in crop yields are required or policy makers will struggle to address the most vital need of hunger and nutrition, particularly in developing countries. 'From additional vitamins in key food crops such as rice to disease-resistant crops, GM technology is providing additional tools for farmers to tackle some of the challenges they face. 'Drought tolerance technology is also being developed, which will allow crops to withstand periods of low soil moisture.'","GM has allowed biotech firms to gain a stranglehold over farming, report claims .

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . The Australian Federal Police were left red-faced after it was revealed sensitive information relating to criminal investigations had been publicly available for a number of years on parliamentary websites. Specific information relating to the targets of investigations, the reason why they were being monitored, their communications, addresses and names of AFP officers not known to the public were some of the details published, according to The Guardian Australia. It comes as the AFP and Federal Government look to drum up support for a data retention policy that would require telecommunications companies to keep a record of what customers did on phones and the internet for two years. This data would be used by Australian law enforcement, anti-corruption and national security agencies to investigate crimes without a warrant. Scroll down for video . In August, the Australian Federal Police were made aware of a privacy breach on parliamentary websites . An AFP spokesman said the information had since been removed after they were alerted to it on August 27. The information was released as part of an answer to a parliamentary question on notice. The spokesman told Daily Mail Australia they took these types of breaches 'very seriously' and had put into place steps to fix the problem after they had reported it themselves to the Australian Privacy Commissioner. He said the AFP had also apologised to those who had been affected by the breach. Targets of investigations, why they were being monitored, their communications, addresses and names of AFP officers not known to the public were some of the details published . According to the spokesman, the details were 'hidden behind electronic redactions within the document' but 'one phone number and an address could, under certain circumstances, be accessed'. This is the latest in a series of blunders that have raised questions over the government's proposed data retention policy. Most notably were Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Attorney-General George Brandis unable to clarify what data would be covered under the policy. In a Sky News interview earlier this month, Mr Brandis was repeatedly asked to clarify what information would actually be captured. 'What you're viewing on the internet is not what we're interested in...what the security agencies want to know, to be retained, is the electronic address of the website that the web user is visiting,' he said. But then Mr Brandis went onto to admit the data collected under the proposal would include the website. After clarification, he explained that the sites visited by a browser would be retained, but not the content that was viewed on the site.","It comes as the government looks at introducing a data retention policy .

"By . Erin Clements for MailOnline . The way that couples interact with a doll filled with rice can predict future parenting behavior, a new study has found. Researchers at Ohio State University asked 182 couples in the third trimester of pregnancy to play with the doll - consisting of pajamas filled with 7lbs of rice and a green fabric head - treating it as though it were their future child. The participants exhibited similar behavior when they were videotaped interacting with the doll, and then caring for their own baby nine months after giving birth. Baby talk: The way that couples interacted with a rice-filled doll (pictured) predicted future parenting behavior in a study at Ohio State University . 'The extent to which couples support or undermine each other’s interactions with the doll predicts their co-parenting behavior a year later,' Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan, a professor of human sciences who co-authored the study with doctoral student Lauren Altenburger, said in a press release. According to Dr Schoppe-Sullivan, some of the couples had a positive attitude, complimenting each other on their parenting style with both the doll and the child. 'With the doll they might say ""You’re going to be such a great dad."" After the birth of the baby, their talk would be very similar: ""You’re such a natural,""' she said. However, those who expressed negativity around the doll were also critical of each other when the baby arrived. 'They might say things like “You’re not going to hold the real baby like that, are you?”' she said. The research took place in the couples' homes, where an assistant acting as a nurse presented the doll to each couple. Child's play: Researchers asked 182 couples in the third trimester of pregnancy to play with the doll - and found that they behaved similarly with their real baby one year later . During each five minute session, the participants played with the doll alone, then with their partner, and then discussed the experience. Dr Schoppe-Sullivan tells MailOnline that some couples laughed and 'looked a little embarrassed' when they were initially presented with the doll. But, she says, 'For the most part, the silliness faded and they were able to get into the situation and take it seriously. ' Researchers later viewed the footage to examine the expectant couples' levels of cooperation, playfulness and family warmth, as well as the structure of the play and the extent to which they showed intuitive parenting behaviors. The study's authors hope that their research will help resolve potential conflicts for future parents. 'When parents fight and undermine each other’s parenting, the child suffers' 'When parents fight and undermine each other’s parenting, the child suffers,' Ms Altenburger said, adding: 'If we can identify couples who may have problems with their co-parenting before their baby is even born, we may be able to intervene.' Dr Schoppe-Sullivan says that even though she believes that the co-parenting relationship begins to develop before childbirth, she was still surprised by the study's results. 'It still amazes me that five minutes of play with a doll can predict co-parenting behavior with the real infant one year later,' she says. 'The association between prenatal and postnatal behavior is modest in size, but it is definitely there. I plan to use this doll-play situation in my future research, because I think it really provides a unique opportunity to watch families develop from the earliest stages,' she adds. The study was conducted as part of the New Parents Project, which is examining how dual-earner couples adjust to becoming parents.","Researchers at Ohio State University asked 182 couples in the third trimester of pregnancy to play with the doll, pretending it was their future child .

And he said the ITV1 show encourages men to try to take advantage of such women on nights out. He said: 'Has TOWIE made an impact? I think it has. The councillor pinpointed TOWIE stars as a reason why women are dressing in revealing garments. Pictured are the reality show stars Lucy Mecklenburgh and Sam Faiers (right) Chris Hossack is urging taxis to reduce their fares . 'They come down to buy clothes from their shops and wear them on the night, trying to make themselves look more attractive. 'My wife read Amy Childs' comments about the need to be responsible but she’s part of the problem as far as I’m concerned. 'The businesses she’s chosen to go into have been built on her attractive looks.' The politician denied that the idea of dropping fares would encourage more women to copy the dress code and added: 'To be honest I don’t think it can get any worse. They can’t possibly wear any less. 'Our key priority is to keep young people safe and stop anti-social behaviour on the streets at night.' His comments were slammed by Victim Support who said: 'It must always be remembered that a victim is just that. 'It should never be suggested that a victim makes themselves open to crime because of what they wear or how they act. 'Where a crime is committed, it is always the perpetrator who must be brought to book.'","Brentwood Borough Council considering urging taxis to drop fares for women in revealing clothes to prevent them becoming a target .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Smiling angelically, Abbie Keers shows the incredible progress she has made since her face was left scarred by a drunken yob who flung a beer bottle. The nine-year-old gymnast was nearly blinded after the Budweiser bottle was hurled on to a dual carriageway by Matthew McCrea – who was yesterday jailed for assault. Six months later, her scars appear virtually healed. Scarred for life: Abbie Keers's face was left scarred (left) by a drunken yob who flung a beer bottle on to a dual carriageway in Stanley, Co. Durham. Six months later, the nine-year-old's scars appear virtually healed (right) But inside, her family say she is still struggling to come to terms with the trauma. ‘She gets really upset and angry and that’s not Abbie,’ said her grandmother Sandra Webb. ‘She is normally such a placid little girl. Her character has changed.’ Earlier, McCrea, 24, received an eight-month sentence at Durham Crown Court for throwing the bottle through a car window in February after drinking 15 lagers. Abbie – who was being driven by Miss Webb on the A693 in Stanley, County Durham – was showered with glass when the front passenger window of her Fiat Punto shattered. Jailed: Matthew McCrea, 24, received an eight-month sentence at Durham Crown Court for throwing the Budweiser bottle through a car window . The schoolgirl was left with injuries to her nose and both eyelids. She was taken to hospital where she had plastic surgery. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Miss Webb said Abbie was still in pain every day and had asked if she was ugly. ‘She looked in the mirror and she said she doesn’t look the same,’ the statement added. McCrea, from Stanley, had admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the basis that he inadvertently hit the moving vehicle. The prosecution said it did not accept that basis for his plea but was not in a position to disprove it. Paul Newcombe, prosecuting, said there were too many variables to scientifically analyse exactly what had happened. Liam O’Brien, defending, said McCrea was ashamed of his actions, which were not premeditated. ‘He and his family are shocked and appalled he could be responsible for the terrible injuries that were caused to this poor young girl,’ Mr O’Brien added. ‘He has learned a terrible lesson, but he has learned it well.’ Outside court, Miss Webb said Abbie had become much quieter since she was injured. ‘She is a lot more within herself but we are trying to rally around her and build up her confidence,’ she added. Sergeant Michael McGowan said: ‘We hope that the sentence will bring some closure to Abbie and her family and allow Matthew McCrea the opportunity to consider the consequences of his actions.’ Impact: Abbie was in the car with her grandmother Sandra Webb (left), her mother Clare (centre) and sister Lexie when the car window was hit by McCrea's bottle .

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . The dream home of a respected architect hangs in the balance today as a judge decides whether it is too modern for its historic neighborhood and should be torn down. Attorneys for architect Louis Cherry and his wife Marsha Gordon, along with a council board backed by some of their neighbors, presented closing arguments to Superior Court Judge Elaine Bushfan on Tuesday. Mr Cherry had been given approval to build their sleek two-story home in the Historic Oakwood neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina almost a year ago. However six months into the project, the council revoked their permission after complaints that the design was ruining the look of the surrounding area. Scroll down for video . Architect Louis Cherry and his wife, Marsha Gordon, stand in front of their home in the Historic Oakwood neighborhood of Raleigh, N.C. in March. A decision on whether the couple may have to demolish the unfinished home because of a neighbor's challenge that it doesn't meet guidelines for the historic district is expected shortly . A sign in front of a Victorian home marks the boundary of the Historic Oakwood District in Raleigh, N.C. The clash over whether a modern house under construction fits in with its older neighbors may finally be over after a judge heard closing arguments on Tuesday . The final word rests with Superior Court Judge Elaine Bushfan. It is not clear when her decision will be made but when it comes, it will be the end of months of bitter fighting in the moneyed streets. If the judge favors the Historic Development Commission, Mr Cherry and Ms Gordon can complete their unfinished home, according to newsobserver.com. However if she upholds the Board of Adjustment’s later reversal of that decision, the house will be torn down. The couple have been unable to continue with the project, and money that could have been spent on finishing their dream home was swallowed up by legal fees. 'It was very much our intention to design and build a house that people would really like and accept,' Mr Cherry, who had already dug the foundation and spent more than $100,000 on building materials, said earlier this year. 'It was very surprising to us that there's been this reaction, as if this is some crazy, modernist intervention.' This  inside of the home at 516 Euclid Street which is facing demolition after neighbors complained about its appearance . The home has an open-plan design in keeping with its modern, minimal values. It could be worth $500,000 on completion... if a judge allows it . Mr Cherry's dream home (pictured here) is under threat after town planners in Raleigh, North Carolina said its design was too radically different from the surrounding neighborhood . Out of options: Nearly six months into construction, with the home roughly finished, Mr Cherry and wife Marsha Gordon faced the possibility that they might have to tear down their dream house . The dispute began last September, when the Raleigh Historic Development Commission issued a certificate of appropriateness, or COA, for the proposed 2,100sq ft house. A few days later, Gail Wiesner, who lives across the street, filed a notice of intent to appeal against the house, that could be valued at as much as $500,000 when finished. But Mr Cherry and Ms Gordon proceeded with construction, saying the city advised them the appeal was merely 'procedural'. Ms Wiesner, a real estate agent, argued that the commission's COA-panel violated several procedures. She called the design 'garishly inappropriate' and said the couple had 'failed to meet their burden of producing competent, material, and substantial testimony and evidence to show that their proposed project preserves the special character of the Oakwood Historic District'. 'The structure as proposed is incongruous to the Oakwood Historic District,' Ms Wiesner, whose home was built in 2008, wrote. 'It will harm the character of the neighborhood and contribute to erosion of the neighborhood's value as an asset to its residents, to the surrounding communities, to the businesses it supports, to in-town and out-of-town visitors, and to the city as a whole.' Oakwood is an eclectic mix of 19th and early 20th century architectural styles - from ornate Italianate mansions and mansard-roofed Victorians, to quaint bungalows and brightly-painted shotgun houses. Houses in the area sell for about $450,000 and the historic district was created in the 1970s, when residents banded together to stop a proposed highway that would have cut through its center. Although Mr Cherry has built a career out of modern architecture, he says his Oakwood home was sympathetic to the surrounding neighborhood, and was simple in design. 'Cherry’s house is an example of modern architecture trying hard, very hard, to be on its best manners - in essence, to be a good neighbor,' Vanity Fair reported. September 2013: The subcommittee of the Raleigh Historic Development Commission votes 3-1 to approve Louis Cherry and Marsha Gordon's new build. The commission, which is appointed by the Raleigh City Council is supposed to judge whether new homes meet the historical guidelines architecturally. Construction started in October 2013. February 2014: Neighbor Gail Wiesner appeals to the Board of Adjustment and it votes 3-2 to revoke the approval for the house. Their justification is that the commission failed in their duty to apply the proper guidelines. The secretive board usually handles permits for day-care centers and minor city code violations. August 2014: If Cherry and Gordon do not win their appeal - their $500,000 home will be torn down. In February, the city's Board of Adjustment voted 3-2 to overturn the certificate of appropriateness. The panel sent word to city hall to issue a 'stop work' order. Word soon spread beyond Oakwood's borders. In early March, Oakwood Modern House launched its own Twitter account, which has more than 2,000 followers. Its raison d'etre reads: 'I'm a modern house fighting for my life in a Victorian neighborhood.' 'Nails hurt. But no love hurts worse,' one tweet read. 'Why does that ugly green house keep staring at me? Stop it,' another said, in reference to Ms Wiesner's home. More recently messages have become even snarkier. 'You'd think neighbors would have something better to do than complain about me, but I guess thinking doesn't always get you far in Oakwood,' one tweet read. 'In the future, every house will be famous for 15 minutes,' another reads. 'I like big [moving] trucks and I cannot lie', it went on, along with: 'I would use this courtroom recess to take a bathroom break, but indoor plumbing is a modern infrastructure yet to be approved in Oakwood.' Will Hillebrenner, an engineer who has been restoring his First World War-era bungalow, is one of many Oakwood residents who believe the historic development commission failed to stick to its own standards. 'The guidelines clearly state that any home, any new construction in the historic district should blend in and not stand out,' he said. 'And a home whose very intent is a living piece of art is intended to stand out.' Many of the architect's neighbors have complained because they feel his modern home does not sit well with their period homes . This is one of the homes directly opposite the Oakwood Modern House designed by Louis Cherry in Raleigh, North Carolina . Mary Iverson, who owns four historic homes in the neighborhood, says the Cherry house is beautiful, but it doesn't belong in Oakwood. 'That is a leap of 100 years of design architecture,' she said. 'So that's not an evolution. That's a, ''So let's go to another planet.''' Gene Conti, whose 1875 Victorian was in the path of the proposed highway, likes the modern house but hates what this fight is doing to Oakwood. 'I think it's been unfortunate ... to have this kind of acrimony all across the neighborhood and have people arguing one side or the other in a very mean-spirited way,' he said. 'Oakwood is a historic neighborhood by designation. But it doesn't mean all the houses are frozen in time.' Ms Gordon and Mr Cherry said that what is happening to them is a violation of Oakwood's spirit. 'You can't build an old home,' Louis Cherry said. 'Forty years of preservation wisdom show that building copycat homes diminishes the value of historic homes. It doesn't really honor them.' 'And it creates a Disneyland kind of community, which is not what Oakwood is,' Ms Gordon said. Oakwood Modern House Twitter account was set up in defense of the modern home and now has more than 2,000 followers . The posts have become snarkier as the neighborhood gripes gathered steam over the past year ending up in a courtroom battle .","Architect Louis Cherry built a home in historic Oakwood that has riled his well-to-do neighbors because it stands out from period properties which are valued around $400,000 .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . She famously shed her baby weight within weeks of having her second child and with a fitness DVD, an OK! health column and a London Triathlon under her belt since the birth of her son AJ in February, Michelle shows no signs of slowing down. So how does she do it? 'I don't know!,' she told MailOnline. 'A very understanding husband maybe and a lot of will power to get up early to work out. I do a lot of my projects at night when the kids are asleep. It's a balancing act. I don't have nannies or family nearby but we make it work.' The fitness-crazed mother-of-two, who recently shared an envy-inducing picture of her toned stomach on holiday, said exercise is extremely important to her. Fitness fanatic: Michelle Heaton has a serious passion for fitness and told FEMAIL that she loves to get a work-out in early in the morning before her children have even woken up . 'It gives me energy and makes me feel good on the inside and out and a happy mum is a happy home,' she said. Michelle, 35, revealed that she works out between four and five times a week and it's always on an empty stomach before her two children, Faith, two, six-month-old son AJ, even wake up. 'I mix up my work outs up so my body is always guessing and never gets used to what I'm doing,' she said of her fitness regime. What's her secret? Michelle, who proudly posted the picture above on Twitter, tries to have a balanced diet and mixes up her work-out regime to keep her body guessing . New campaign: Michelle, who is currently promoting the Care ViraSoothe Sing-along competition, is an extremely hands-on mother and loves singing at home with her children . When it comes to food, she says that she's tried every type of diet in the past but nothing works for her other than when she's eating really healthily at home. 'I very rarely slip up with my food in the house but I reward my hard work with date nights and eating out at weekends,' she said. 'It's all a balancing act with maintenance, if you’re good 70 per cent of the time you should enjoy the other 30 per cent. 'However, if weight loss is your goal then there's no 30 per cent margin - it's called a diet for a reason so you need to put in the hard work and have patience to lose weight effectively. It doesn’t happen overnight.' Michelle, who is currently promoting the Care ViraSoothe Sing-along competition, is an extremely hands-on mother and loves singing at home with her children. Future popstar? Michelle shot to fame in pop group Liberty-X so will  Faith be a star one day too? Michelle says she will guide her daughter as best she can in whatever she chooses to do . Little one: Michelle, pictured with baby boy AJ, says that every day is a challenge and she learns something new about her children all the time . So would she want little Faith to follow in her pop star footsteps? 'She's definitely a star in my eyes, whether it translates in later life who knows. I will let her decide and guide her as best as I can along the way,' said Michelle. Michelle, who won Disney's Mum of the Year Award back in March, said to win an award which was voted for by the public was an 'unbelievable feeling'. The former Liberty-X star shared what she thinks makes a great mother, saying: 'I personally think what makes a good mum is patience, nurturing and listening to your child's wants and needs instead of imposing your own ways that you may have read about in a book - every child and family is different. 'Every day is a challenge; you learn something new about your children or parenting or even yourself. It's challenging but rewarding all at the same time as you see these beautiful people growing up before your eyes. I love learning about my children, it's fascinating.' Girl's night out: Michelle Heaton recently took a few hours off mother duty and enjoyed a night out in the city at wine experience Vinopolis, as part of the Summer Of Love events calendar, and newly opened restaurant Forge with gal pals including fellow singer Liz McClarnon, Gemma Bissix of Hollyoaks fame, Nicola Stapleton most recently on EastEnders and Melanie Cameron . Michelle was diagnosed as a carrier of the deadly cancer gene BRCA2 gene in 2012 and subsequently announced that she would have a full hysterectomy to avoid the risk of ovarian cancer, which she said she would be doing for the sake of her family. Aside from that, she is about to start filming a documentary and she has some projects coming up with the Lorraine show. She added: 'I’m also going on a trek next year in Morocco for the Genesis Trust – it’s in support of women in a similar position to me who’ve been though similar experiences. Come and join me; there are still places left!'. Finding fame: Michelle shot to fame with Liberty X, here she is pictured in 2007 .

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . Fast food restaurants, with their focus on dollar-menus, questionable agriculture practices and ever-cheaper deals, will soon become a thing of the past, according to the chief executive of Chipotle. The chain is poised to change the face of fast food in America, according to Monty Moran, and the way consumers think about what they eat. Moran blasted fast food chains - without naming names - for their treatment of employees and the food itself. Big plans: Chipotle's growth and popularity show that 'traditional' fast food chains are becoming irrelevant, according to CEO Monty Moran . 'By traditional fast food I mean where the predominant goal is the cheapening of the raw ingredients, the automation of the work such that anyone could do it... so that they turn over their employees without any care for them, where it’s a game of value meals and cheapening and cheapening the food experience,' Moran said in an interview for The Street. 'That is traditional fast food, and we think that's going away. We, and others like us, will replace that.' Despite being deemed 'irrelevant' by Moran, traditional fast food chains are still goliaths compared to Chipotle. According to Business Insider, Chipotle has 1,700 locations that generated $3.21 billion in revenue last year. Vision: Chipotle CEO Monty Moran says the company wants to 'change the way people eat fast food' By comparison, McDonald has 35,000 locations worldwide which brought in $28.1 billion. However, with plans to open more Chipotle locations and two new concepts in the works - Asian-inspired ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale - Moran's brag could prove prescient. And while Chipotle remains small compared to multi-national chains such as Burger King and McDonald's, it's outstripping them in terms of growth. Chipotle's gross profit margins were 66.6 per cent to Starbucks' 57.1 per cent and McDonald's 56 per cent. 'Our mission is to change how people eat fast food,' Moran told The Street. Founder Steve Ells opened the first Chipotle restaurant in Denver in 1993. It was a means to raise money to open his own fine-dining restaurant but when the concept took off, he switched focus to expanding the chain. All Chipotle restaurants are company-owned - there are no franchises. 'Our vision is that any concept we are involved with will benefit from our unique people culture. We think that the people culture and food culture, as well as the unit economic model, are what yields the extraordinary success that we've had, and are keys to any concept going forward,' Moran said.","Chipotle CEO Monty Moran has deemed 'traditional' fast food restaurants 'irrelevant'

"By . James Tozer for the Daily Mail . A farmer who knocked down his neighbour in his tractor in the culmination of a three-year feud over access to his property has walked free from court. Frank Ainsworth, 64, was accused of deliberately trying to mow down Colin MacDiarmid, a policeman, after spotting him digging holes in a gravelled lane next to his cottage. The 43-year-old sergeant claimed the sheep farmer had threatened to ‘drive over him’ if he didn’t stop what he was doing. It came after as many as 20 incidents were reported to police amid a dispute over access to Mr Ainsworth’s remote farm. Scroll down for video . Frank Ainsworth (pictured right) allegedly moved down his police officer neighbour, Colin MacDiarmid (left) A court heard that the farmer accused his police officer  of digging holes at the side of the gravelled lane in the rural Turn Hill area of Rossendale, Lancashire . The tractor caught Sergeant MacDiarmid’s leg at what he claimed was 20mph before crushing his wheelbarrow. Mr Ainsworth insisted that he had simply failed to spot his neighbour as it was getting dark but he was brought before court this week to face charges of assault and criminal damage to the £50 wheelbarrow. However, the officer was not present after being seconded to Cardiff ahead of next week’s Nato conference. Magistrates insisted that the case go ahead and the prosecution was forced to offer no evidence. The farmer maintained that the collision had been an accident and described the prosecution as a ‘phenomenal’ waste of everyone’s time. Mr Ainsworth, who was awarded his costs, said he had reported Sgt MacDiarmid to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his conduct. The house where Colin MacDiarmid lived for three years. He was locked in a three year dispute with his neighbour, Frank Ainsworth, regarding the track leading to his farmyard (pictured far right) He claimed that his 25-year-old tractor would have struggled to reach 20mph ‘going downhill’ even in top gear. ‘This has been a phenomenal amount of police time and a waste of taxpayers’ cash,’ he said. ‘As regards his injury, I have had worst grazes on my hands catching sheep. ‘I was doing 5mph on my tractor and he was digging in the road in the dark – I simply didn’t know he was there.’ Details of the fracas last February emerged as Mr Ainsworth appeared at Burnley Magistrates’ Court. The farmer, who has reared sheep on a hillside near Rossendale, Lancashire, for three decades, sold cottages on his farmland with conditions that buyers sign covenants granting him right of way to get to his farm, the court heard. Frank Ainsworth said after the hearing: 'This has been beyond being a nightmare. Life will be better now' Video courtesy of the DSCV . But trouble began around three years ago after Sgt MacDiarmid, an officer with Greater Manchester Police for 17 years, and his wife moved into one of the cottages with their twin daughters. Sarah Johnson, prosecuting, said the altercation followed a verbal dispute during which Mr Ainsworth – who was on a quad bike – was said to have threatened to drive his tractor over Sgt MacDiarmid. After the officer warned him he would be committing a criminal offence the farmer was alleged to have said: ‘I don’t give a f***.’ The farmer drove off but returned soon after in his tractor and the collision occurred. Nick Dearing, defending Mr Ainsworth, said: ‘This was not a serious injury – more similar to an injury sustained in rugby practice. At the end of the day this is a trial with a broken wheelbarrow and a graze. ‘He maintains it was an accident down a narrow dark lane late at night and without any malice.’ Sgt MacDiarmid, who was commended in 2011 for his role in rescuing a girl who fell from a 150ft viaduct, has since moved out of the cottage. He was unavailable for comment. The prosecution blamed his absence on an ‘admin error’.

An armed fugitive wanted for nearly two decades on cocaine trafficking charges was wounded during a shootout with deputy U.S. marshals and finally arrested. Oswald Lewis, 44, who is also a suspect in a violent stabbing, was tracked down to an apartment in Queens, New York, on Tuesday evening. Wearing a bulletproof vest and armed with two semi-automatic handguns, Lewis fired several rounds at the officers moments after they entered the apartment, police said. The task force returned fire and hit him once in the hand before he surrendered, according to authorities. Investigators say Lewis only gave himself up after running out of ammunition. He was then taken to Jamaica Hospital in New York. Lewis was wanted on federal and state cocaine trafficking charges in Virginia from the 1990s. The Guyana native allegedly used a false name to evade authorities after his last arrest in North Carolina in 1995, police said. He is expected to appear in federal court in Brooklyn later this week to face the charges. Neighbour Stacey Barnett said: 'I hear the suspect himself screaming, 'They're going to kill me, they're trying to kill me. Before I know it, it was over.'

Like magic: When the anatase titanium dioxide coats the fabric, any stain - from dirt to coffee and even red wine - on its surface will be eliminated after being placed in light for 24 hours . What's more, lead scientist Walid Daoud says that the finished fabric will only bump up the price of cashmere by one to 1.5per cent. Not only is the invention the ultimate in smart technology, but it's also beneficial to the environment. 'On the one hand, clothes that can clean themselves are regarded as smart material,' said Mr Daoud. 'And on the other hand ... we also have less consumption of energy, of water, of chemicals.' The coating was actually first developed in 2002, but applying it to cashmere has proved difficult since the delicate fabric is especially prone to damage.

"By . Simon Tomlinson for MailOnline . If Russian soldiers were in any doubt where their country was on the map, they can rest a bit easier now. In response to claims that Vladimir Putin's troops stumbled into Ukraine 'by mistake', Canadian NATO officials have posted a mocking tweet complete with a primary school-style geography lesson. The message contains a rather helpful map which is colour-coded and marked in block letters to clearly show that Ukraine was 'NOT RUSSIA' and that Russia was indeed 'RUSSIA'. Scroll down for video . Canadian officials at NATO posted this sarcastic tweet with a map showing that Ukraine was 'NOT RUSSIA' and that Russia was 'RUSSIA' in response to claims that Russian soldiers found themselves in Ukraine by mistake . In a further broadside at the Russian president, the area marked 'NOT RUSSIA' includes the Crimea peninsula, which was controversially annexed by Moscow in March. In a message dripping with sarcasm, the tweet said: 'Geography can be tough. 'Here's a guide for Russian soldiers who keep getting lost & ""accidentally"" entering #Ukraine.' It came in response to claims by the Kremlin that ten paratroopers captured in Ukrainian territory earlier this week had accidentally crossed the border because it was 'poorly marked'. The version was widely disbelieved in Kiev, which claims it has faced repeated attacks from Kremlin troops in a conflict which has seen almost 2,300 deaths. The crisis in Ukraine escalated further today when president Petro Poroshenko accused Russia of a military invasion. Prisoners: These pictures show two of the ten Russian paratroopers who claimed they entered Ukraine by accident because the border was poorly marked, a version which is being mocked by Canadian NATO officials . The Kiev leader - who changed his plans shortly before leaving Kiev's Boryskil airport - demanded an urgent meeting of the UN security council as one senior aide called on him to impose martial law. 'The Russian Federation's troops have entered Ukraine,' said Poroshenko less than two days after shaking hands with Vladimir Putin on a peace roadmap. 'The world must give an assessment of the sharp aggravation of the situation in Ukraine,' he said. 'I have taken the decision to cancel the visit to Turkey due to the sharp deterioration of the situation in the Donetsk region, particularly in Amvrosiyivka and Starobesheve, as Russian troops have been sent into Ukraine.' Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko (left) today accused Vladimir Putin (right) of a military invasion as he abruptly cancelled a trip to Turkey to meet his top security officials . Poroshenko urgently summoned a meeting of his National Security and Defence Council. Senior Interior Ministry adviser Anton Heraschenko warned: 'The incursion of Putin's Russian Federation regular army into Ukraine is an accomplished fact.' He claimed there was a need for martial law in Ukraine and urged EU countries to halt buying Russian oil, gas, timber and other natural resources, and also to discontinue granting of any credits, and freeze Russian state companies' assets in the EU. The Ukraine has now called for urgent and 'large-scale' military assistance from EU countries amid Kiev's allegation of a Russian invasion.","Canadian chiefs troll Russia with Twitter message dripping with sarcasm .

Captain Mike Utley, the 22,000-tonne ship's commanding officer, said they bade farewell with a mixture of sadness and pride. He said: 'It has been a great honour to be the final commanding officer of HMS Illustrious. This is a symbolic day in the history of the Royal Navy as we lower the ensign for the final time on the Invincible class.' Illustrious, which was rushed into service for the Falklands War, is being replaced as the nation's helicopter carrier by HMS Ocean that has recently undergone a £65 million refit. It will eventually be replaced by two new 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales.

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . A video texting service confirmed today that an audio recording - which appears to contain the sound of shots fired by Officer Darren Wilson when he killed unarmed Michael Brown - is authentic. Chaim Haas, head of communications at Glide, verified  the tape recorded by an unnamed individual in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9. An estimated 11 shots are heard to ring out in the background of the recording with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four. Glide released a lengthy statement on their website today which said the user had been live video-messaging  with a friend when the gunshots that killed Michael Brown were caught in the background audio. Scroll down for video . Glide, an app which provides a real-time video texting service, said on Thursday that the audiotape was genuine and that it was now in the hands of the FBI . The statement continued: 'Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second. In this case, the video in question was created at 12:02:14 PM (CDT) on Saturday, August 9th.' Officer Darren Wilson shot dead Michael Brown on August 9. On a new audio at least ten shots can be heard . Glide confirmed to MailOnline today that the FBI had been in touch with them regarding the audio recording. The start-up business also said in the statement that it was proud of their app user for turning over the video message to the FBI investigation. Experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson. In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots crack in the background - seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four. Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown. 'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Ms Blumenthal. 'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.' A police expert also said that the recording could cause problems for Officer Wilson who is on leave from the force while a federal investigation is carried out. 'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN. 'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.' If  the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on August 9. The medical examiner of behalf of the Brown family released this autopsy drawing which revealed Brown had been shot six times including once in the head . At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head. Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling the opening of his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'. Johnson then alleged that Wilson continued to fire on the 18-year-old. Photographs surround the casket of Michael Brown before the start of his funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St Louis on Monday. The unarmed teen was killed on August 9 . Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire. Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture. But CNN reported last Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury. Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source. Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries. Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime. He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him. Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox. Michael Brown's funeral was held on Monday at a St Louis church in front of thousands of mourners.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A bid to win favour at a  strip club went disastrously wrong for a man who claimed he was Spike Lee's son - when staff realised the boy in question is only 17. Despite wielding a fabled American Express black card, the mystery partier was reportedly thrown out of the New York venue as soon as curious bouncers looked up the teenager on Google. According to the report in the New York Post, the spurned clubber shouted: 'I’m not going to be arrested. No one’s going to arrest me!', before racing to a waiting car. Bold: A man reportedly claimed he was Jackson Lee (right), the son of Hollywood director Spike (left), to get into a strip club - but he was busted when staff looked Jackson up on Google and realised he is only 17 . Hollywood legend Spike Lee, 57, whose directing credits include Malcolm X (1992) and He Got Game (1998), has two children with his wife of more than 20 years Tonya Lewis Lee. His daughter Satchel was born in 1994 while his son Jackson was born in 1997, putting both well under the legal drinking age of 21. A source told the newspaper the party-goer dropped Jackson's name when he arrived at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club in the early hours last week, and showed an ID which said he was 22 years old. Then, the report claimed, he placed the $60 entry fee on an American Express Centurion card, better known as the invitation-only 'black card' whose users earn an average of $1.3million. Its users must spend at least $250,000 a year - and even then it'll cost them an annual fee of $2,500 along with a $7,500 initiation fee. But Jackson's mother told the Post the man at the club was not her son, adding any suggestion that he was would be a 'bald-faced lie'. What a hustler: The man flashed an American Express Centurion card at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club in New York . It would not be the first time a fake celebrity has caused a stir in New York City.

It worked - and he caused a crush of 300 people while posing for photographs with groups of giggling girls. He later said it was a 'social experiment,' which showed 'how our culture is so obsessed with celebrity and fame'. Widely hailed as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation, Spike Lee has devoted his film career to tales of urban poverty, inequality and race relations. He has twice been nominated for an Oscar, the first for Do the Right Thing (1989) and the second for 4 Little Girls (1997).","Report claimed man flashed fake ID and Amex black card at Manhattan club .

The covert camera footage, which formed a key part of the sting, offers a rare insight into the secret world of the Calabrian Mafia and its unusual rituals. Translated from Italian, Nesci starts the meeting by announcing: 'I baptise this place - as it was christened by our Spanish knights, Osso Mastrosso and Carcagnosso' who arrived in Calabria 'with irons and chains'. He then tells the men 'You can work in everything – extortion, cocaine, heroin' after officially baptising the meeting as part of a bizarre tradition . Roughly translated, he later insists 'we are clean, clean – it has taken years to build up this reputation… I repeat again, the society of Frauenfeld is one of honour, wisdom and dignity' He then unashamedly talks about the gang's extortion rackets and murders - not included in the video. Swiss police have called Nesci's gang 'heavyweight operators' heavily involved in hard drugs and weapons dealing. Nesci, among those arrested last week, is thought to answer directly to the jailed 'Ndrangheta leader and so-called 'boss of bosses', Domenico Oppedisano, 83. The small town of Frauenfeld, just north of Zurich in Switzerland - where the Mafia meeting took place . Oppedisano was arrested with 300 other Mafia suspects in Italy in 2010 and is currently serving a 13-year sentence. Police obtained evidence with which to convict him after bugging the trees in his Calabrian orange grove. Italian police say the Frauenfeld cell was directly answerable to the 'Ndrangheta's rulers in Calabria and there are rumours Nesci also led Mafia operations in southern Germany. Police investigators bugged a meeting at a pizzeria in the south German town of Singen in 2009, during which a similar 'baptism ceremony' was held. Prosecutors in Italy have complained about a lack of action from other European countries in dealing with the 'Ndrangheta, which is now seen as the Mafia's most powerful group. They claim it took six Italians being brutally executed outside a restaurant in Duisburg in 2007 for German authorities to wake up to the threat.","Sinister secret meeting in small Swiss town of Frauenfeld, north of Zurich .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . After six months sheltering in the warmth and security of his mother's pouch, this cute baby joey is taking his first peek into the big bad world. The fluffy little Matschie's tree kangaroo and his much larger mother both have thick woolly coats, so look more like bears than traditional kangaroos. This male Joey, named Rocket, was born in captivity at the Saint Louis Zoo in Missouri to his mother Kasbeth and father Iri, and will remain in Kasbeth's pouch for another two months before actually taking his first tiny steps into the outside world. Peek-a-boo! Tiny joey Rocket takes his first look at the outside world from the safety of his mother's pouch . Room for a little one: The baby Matchie's tree kangaroo has been in the pouch for six months . Matschie's tree kangaroo joeys tend to stay and develop in pouches for the first eight months of their lives, and also return to them frequently for milk in the following two months, before being let loose for good. Little Rocket was incredibly small when he was born - just the size of a butter bean - but has now grown to the size of a small cat. Visitors have been flocking to the zoo to catch a rare glimpse of him peeping out of his pouch, but only few are lucky enough to spot the little joey, as he pokes his head out and admires his new surroundings. Bear necessities: The tree kangaroos seem to resemble bears rather than their kangaroo cousins . The Matschie's tree kangaroo is highly endangered, and can only be found in the wild in the mountainous forests of Papua New Guinea - some of the last undisturbed rainforest habitat in the world. They spend most of their time in trees, and can live at heights of up to 11,000 feet. They are vegetarian, and eat mostly leaves, as well as bark, flowers, moss and ferns. A joey will stay with its mother until it is about 18 months old, before leaving to set up a home  of its own. They are believed to be polygamous and fairly solitary creatures, with the only real bond seen between mother and baby.","Rocket was born in captivity at the Saint Louis Zoo in Missouri, USA .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Jonathan O'Callaghan . The power of Twitter has been highlighted once again after its users selected a new entry for the Collins English Dictionary. Collins scoured the microblogging site to find emerging . words and the winning term, which will be added to its official dictionary later this year, was 'adorkable'. The term, which means 'adorable dork' was first used on Twitter in March 2007 before peaking in January 2012, and was the most-voted word from a shortlist drawn up by the publisher. Twitter users were asked to vote on new words to enter the October 2014 edition of the Collins English Dictionary. Entries were tweeted using a hashtag and the winning word was 'adorkable', which means a person who is 'dorky in an adorable way' (stock image pictured) According to Collins, adorkable is an adjective that is slang for a 'socially inept or unfashionable person that conducts themselves in a charming or endearing way'. It is a blend of 'adorable' and 'dork'. The researchers said it has . now settled into a 'steady and rising pattern of use.' The shortlisted words were crowdsourced, drawn from those submitted by members of the public on www.collinsdictionary.com. Analysis of the words, to define levels of usage, was carried out in the Collins Corpus and on Twitter to ensure that all of the words under consideration were in general use, before they were included in the shortlist. Using Twitter data to measure a word’s popularity is a natural extension of the established process by which Collins English Dictionary is compiled, the company said. It analysed word usage across a range of UK and international print and digital media held in the Collins Corpus - an enormous database of over 4.5 billion words that is constantly updated. To vote, users needed to tweet using a hashtag of their favourite word - such as #adorkable - with Collins then seeing which words had the most mentions. The winning word, adorkable, will enter the October 2014 edition of the Collins English Dictionary. 1. Adorkable, which means dorky in an adorable way, won the day with 30 per cent of the vote. 2. Felfie, or a farmer selfie, achieved 22 per cent of the vote. 3. Fatberg, which is a large mass of solid waste or grease clogging up a sewage system, won 13 per cent of the vote. 4. Nomakeupselfie  - a selfie of a woman without her make-up, posted online to raise awareness for a charity - was coined during a social media craze started by Cancer Research. 5. Gaybourhood is a gay-friendly . neighbourhood such as Castro in San Francisco. Use of gaybourhood on Twitter has grown steadily . since its first appearance in a tweet in March 2006. Adorkable underwent a huge surge in popularity after the TV show New Girl, starring Zooey Deschanel (pictured in May 2014), was launched on 20 September 2011. She is often described using the term, which led to it storming to the front of the 'Twictionary' competition run by Collins . 'We are excited about using Twitter because it offers open, accessible public data for us to monitor and analyse through its APIs (application programming interface),' said Andrew Freeman, Associate Publishing Director for Collins. 'Twitter is a news site with robust patterns of usage and reactions to events and growing movements which lend themselves to language development and invention. 'Twitter's limit of 140 characters per message puts a focus on language, meaning users have to come up with new words and language to make the most of the platform. 'This is the first activity of its kind - using social media to compile dictionary entries - and we would be keen to work with a range of social media channels in the future. The animation above shows how the usage of three of the shortlisted words varied over time around the world . The company said using Twitter to choose a new word is a natural evolution of the process usually used to select new words. Fracktivist, for example, is a word growing in popularity used to describe someone who protests against fracking, but it didn't make the final five words (stock image pictured) Lucy Mangan, who blogs on collinsdictionary.com and is a contributor to Collins English Dictionary, added: 'The people - or at least the tweeple - have spoken! ‘Adorkable is the word they can't be without. 'Into the dictionary it goes, allowing Collins to close the gap between the recording of a living language and its movements in the real world more than ever before.' 'At last the internet starts giving something back to word nerds.'","Twitter users were asked to vote on new words for the 'Twictionary'

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . An incredible hyperlapse video showing President Barak Obama's Marine One helicopter landing has been captured - on a mobile phone app. Oliver Cox, an associate producer at NBC news, claims he filmed the US President arriving at the White House using Instagram's new app feature. The Hyperlapse footage - available for the iPhone and iPad - shows the helicopter coming into land on the grass - although the President is not seen. President Obama has a fleet of helicopters and decoys that are often employed for security purposes. Marine One coordinates with the Marines, the New York Police Department and the Secret Service to ensure his safety. The Instagram app uses a similar principle to time-lapse photography which combines thousands of shots into a video. Subjects include clouds crossing a sky, a flower opening or fruit rotting as the gradual movement can be speeded up. An Instagram spokesperson said: 'Since launching nearly four years ago, it has always been a priority to bring the Instagram community simple yet powerful tools that let people capture moments and express their creativity. Marine One comes down to land on the South lawn at the White House. NBC news producer Oliver Cox is on hand with his iPhone snapping away . Mr Cox used Instagram's new hyperlapse feature to create the video on his iPhone . 'Hyperlapse from Instagram features built-in stabilization technology that lets you create moving, handheld time lapses that result in a cinematic look, quality and feel — a feat that has previously only been possible with expensive equipment.

"By . Associated Press . Prisoner Clayton Lockett was killed by drugs and not a heart attack during his botched execution, a report revealed today . A death row inmate who died following a problematic execution succumbed to the lethal drugs he was administered, not a heart attack, after the state's prisons chief halted efforts to kill him, an autopsy report released Thursday says. Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton had said inmate Clayton Lockett died from a heart attack several minutes after he ordered the execution stopped. But the autopsy report performed for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said all three execution drugs were found throughout Lockett's system. A medical examiner declared that the cause of death was 'judicial execution by lethal injection.' Oklahoma put executions on hold after Lockett gasped and writhed against his restraints for several minutes after his April execution began. Lockett was poked several times as medical technicians tried to find a vein before settling in using one at his groin. Gov. Mary Fallin has ordered public safety officials to review the events surrounding Lockett's death, including state execution protocols that had been changed in the weeks before Lockett's execution. The state Court of Criminal Appeals agreed to not schedule executions for six months. Three are set for mid-November and early December. A spokesman for Fallin, Alex Weintz, said the autopsy report will be part of the DPS review. 'We suspect they are in the final stages of that process,' Weintz said. He said Fallin still supports use of the death penalty despite the problems encountered with Lockett's execution. 'But we want our executions to be successful,' Weintz said. 'She has asked DPS to make recommendations on what possible updates to the protocols we can pursue.' The autopsy report details Lockett's cause of death and does not include recommendations about the state's execution protocols. The gurney in the execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. Oklahoma put executions on hold after Lockett gasped and writhed against his restraints for several minutes after his April execution began . Under the protocols, Oklahoma used the sedative midazolam for the first time. The drug was also used in lengthy attempts to execute an Ohio inmate in January and an Arizona prisoner last month. Each time, witnesses said the inmates appeared to gasp for air moments after their executions began and continued to labor for air before being pronounced dead. Patton, the director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, called for a complete 'review/revision' to the execution protocols in Oklahoma following the Lockett execution, and said he was willing to adopt other states' protocols to 'ensure the Oklahoma protocol adopts proven standards.' Among his concerns were that the state's current protocol puts all the responsibility and decision-making in the hands of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary warden, who is responsible for overseeing executions. Patton, who came to Oklahoma from the Arizona Department of Corrections, didn't specifically mention the drug midazolam or any other formula approved for use in the Oklahoma death chamber. Midazolam is part of a three-drug and a two-drug protocol in Oklahoma. Lockett's execution used a three-drug protocol —midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. The state also has a protocol that would use midazolam with hydromorphone, the same combination used in the problematic executions in Ohio and Arizona this year. Lockett was sentenced to death for the killing of 19-year-old Stephanie Nieman 15 years ago in Oklahoma. Neiman happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time – she stopped at the home to drop off a friend in the middle of the robbery Lockett was committing. All witnesses agreed to secrecy except Neiman, Lockett had a solution. ‘Let’s take them out in the country and leave them,' Lockett recalled saying. They said, ‘No. We can’t do that. We’ll still get caught. 'I said, ‘The only thing we can do is take them to the country, and kill them... I couldn’t convince her not to tell.' Lockett shot Neiman twice with a sawed-off shotgun and watched two other men bury her alive, he confessed. 'I could hear her breathing and crying and everything,' Lockett says in the video made public by KFOR while casually smoking a cigarette. The footage was shot only two days after a break-in led to the shocking murder.

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A beloved grocery chain CEO who was ousted from the company by his cousin - causing a six week standoff between management and thousands of workers - has struck a deal  to return to the helm. Arthur T. Demoulas has reportedly made a $1.5 billion offer to buy out the part of the New England-based chain Market Basket controlled by his cousin, Arthur S. Demoulas. When Arthur T. - whom employees likened to George Bailey in 'It's a Wonderful Life' for putting people before profits - was ousted by a board of directors controlled by Arthur S. Demoulas in June, workers refused to work and marched the streets in protest. 'Words cannot express how much I appreciate each and every one of you,' Arthur T. said from the back of a pickup truck out the store's headquarters in Tewksbury, Masachusetts on Thursday morning. 'You are simply the best.' Scroll down for video . Joy: Arthur T. Demoulas, the CEO of New England grocery chain Market Basket, pictured Thursday, has struck a deal with the company's board after he was ousted 6 weeks ago - sparking protests from workers . Thankful: The restored CEO speaks to employees at company headquarters in Tewksbury on Thursday . He continued: 'As I stand here, there is very little that I could ever add to your brilliant work, your extraordinary display of loyalty, and the power of your enduring spirit over the past several weeks.' For weeks, warehouse employees had failed to make deliveries to the stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, leaving shelves bare and costing millions in lost revenue. But on Thursday, tractor-trailers bearing the Market Basket logo and laden with the tons of food it will take to restock the chain's 71 stores, pulled up to loading docks. Just hours before, Market Basket said that Arthur T. would be returning to the company and that he and his management team would handle day-to-day operations while the purchase is completed. The company's two current CEOs, Felicia Thornton and Jim Gooch, will remain in place until the deal is closed, the statement said. The closing is expected in the 'next several months'. 'All associates are welcome back to work with the former management team to restore the company back to normal operations,' Arthur T. Demoulas said in a statement. Happiness: Meat manager Bob Dietz hugs cashier Mary Olson after watching a televised speech by their restored boss on Thursday. Staff had been fired for refusing to work - but Arthur T. has reinstated them . Emotional: Market Basket employees Rosimeire Farias, left, and Luz Medina, of Revere, watch his speech . Support: The workers at a store in Chelsea, Massachusetts celebrated the return of their former CEO . 'I feel like I won the lottery,' Market Basket truck driver Buddy Wemmers told The Boston Globe. Gary Sessa, a front end manager at the chain's Tewksbury store, told WFXT-TV that company bakers came in at midnight after hearing the news and started baking cakes that say: 'Welcome back Artie T: Market Basket Strong.' In a joint statement on Wednesday, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan said: 'We are delighted that the parties have reached agreement on terms of sale and resolution of operating authority, so that employees can return to work and customers will once again be able to rely on these stores to meet their needs.' The uproar over Arthur T. Demoulas' firing prompted massive protest rallies outside the company's Tewksbury headquarters. After the company fired eight supervisors who helped organize the revolt, public support for the workers intensified. Back to work: Employees embrace near a poster welcoming customers back to the stores on Thursday . Stocking up: Luis Morales, of Boston, makes a food delivery to a Market Basket on Thursday morning as the standoff came to an end and employees stocked the shelves after six weeks of refusing to work . Restocking: Employees put produce back on the once empty shelves, happy that their boss is back at the helm . Thousands of customers, as well as more than 160 mayors and legislators in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, signed petitions agreeing to boycott Market Basket. The chain has about 25,000 employees and 71 stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. The stores, usually jam-packed with shoppers attracted by the chain's low prices, have had only a trickle of customers for weeks. The company's new co-CEOs had repeatedly urged employees to return to work, but they refused and insisted on the reinstatement of Arthur T. Demoulas. Business analysts said the worker revolt was remarkable at a family-owned, non-union company - particularly because the workers were not seeking higher wages or better benefits, but instead were calling for the return of their former boss. The workers credit Arthur T. Demoulas for treating them like family, keeping prices low and leading the company's success. Family business: After Arthur T. was ousted from the company, which has 71 stores across Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, workers refused to return to their jobs in a show of solidarity . Uproar: Market Basket employees and supporters jeer at a car driving into the supermarket's headquarters in Tewksbury, Massachusetts last week - the fifth week of revolts - after their boss was ousted . Empty: Warehouse workers refused to make deliveries or restock shelves in a show of solidarity - a move that led to many being fired and a loss of tens of millions in revenue for the company . 'You know the movie, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" He's George Bailey,' said Tom Trainor, a district supervisor who worked for the company for 41 years before being fired over the protests. Feud: He had been ousted by a board of directors led by his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas (pictured) 'He's just a tremendous human being that puts people above profits. He can walk through a store, and if he's met you once, he knows your name, he knows your wife, your husband, your kids, where they are going to school.' Renee Mulhane, a part-time Market Basket employee in Tewksbury, said late on Wednesday she was hoping an agreement was reached so that she could return to the job she held for 13 years before being laid off two weeks ago. 'It has been inspiring the amount of support the public has shown' the workers, she said. The situation has 'been draining, but inspiring'. In its statement, Market Basket said: 'All associates are welcome back to work with the former management team to restore the Company back to normal operations.' Infighting in the Demoulas family has gone on for decades, but this was the first time the family's squabble had such a deep impact on Market Basket stores. Market Basket stores have long been a fixture in New England. The late Arthur Demoulas, a Greek immigrant who was the grandfather of Arthur T. and Arthur S., opened the first store in Lowell nearly a century ago. Over the years, Market Basket became a favorite of frugal food shoppers. Today, the chain has 71 stores and about 25,000 employees. Beloved: Arthur T. was likened to George Bailey, right, in the film It's A Wonderful Life. Employees said that the beloved CEO put people before profits and always remembered everything about his workers .","Arthur T.

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . An English-language magazine published by Al Qaeda's media arm calls on Muslims around the world to use homemade car bombs on targets including Las Vegas casinos, New York's Times Square and UK department stores. The online publication, entitled Palestine: Betrayal of the Guilty Conscience Al-Malahem, also includes a nine-page spread with instructions on how to 'make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom.' There is also a timeline of terror attacks, including 9/11 and the Boston bombings that includes a blank entry marked '201?' implying a terror attack on American soil is planned for the near future. Terrorist's handbook: 'Palestine: Betrayal of the guilty conscience' is an English-language online publication that encourage extremists living in Western countries to carry out acts of terrorism . The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) first flagged the publication. 'The timeline concludes with the date 201?’ and blank spaces and question marks for the photo and information of the next attack - implying that it is coming soon,' MEMRI Executive Director Steve Stalinsky told Fox News. The guide to making a carbomb comes complete with step-by-step photographs, a shopping list, and admiring words about the Tsarnaev brothers, the 'Boston brothers.' 'My Muslim brother: we are conveying to you our military training right into your kitchen to relieve you of the difficulty of traveling to us,' it reads. Terrorism timeline: The blank entry at the end of this timeline implies another attack is expected . Haunting: The disturbing publication ends with the words, 'We are coming' 'If you are sincere in your intentions to serve the religion of Allāh, then all what you have to do is enter your kitchen and make an explosive device that would damage the enemy if you put your trust . in Allāh and then use this explosive device properly.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It might be the happiest place on earth, but your wallet won't be feeling any happier after splashing out even more to 'experience the magic' of Disney. The cost of going to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World just got more expensive. Although Disney won't specify the reasons behind the increase, the Florida parks are home to the . company's new high-tech wristband-based ticketing and ride reservation . system, called MyMagic+ which cost the company $1.5 billion. Better start saving: The price of a one-day ticket to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom is now $99. That's a $4 increase from the previous price hike announced in June 2013. The price hike went into effect Sunday . Extra costs: MyMagic+, includes wristbands, dubbed MagicBands, which are outfitted with radio-frequency identification chips that interact with scanners throughout the park . Known as MagicBands, they function as all-in-one theme-park tickets, hotel-room keys and credit cards. The bracelets allow reservations to be made for individual rides to be made from home for as many as three attractions a day in a single theme park — or four in the Magic Kingdom. MyMagic+, which Disney began developing more than five years ago cost close to $1.5 billion according to the Orlando Sentinel and is likely to be a major factor behind this weeks price increase. Disney expects to recoup the large . investment by encouraging guests to spend more on things like souvenirs . and foods and by getting them to spend longer in the parks. Is it worth it? Walt Disney Co. faces growing questions from Wall Street about when the company will see financial returns from the sweeping technology project, which Disney hopes will ultimately get visitors planning more of their vacations in advance and spending more time and money on its property . How it works: MyMagic+ is designed to allow visitors to book ride times weeks before their vacations, and the MagicBands act as all-in-one park tickets, room keys and credit cards . By collecting more personal data about visitors, from their favorite characters to their spending habits, Disney hopes to develop more effective sales offers customized for individual families. Not only did the annual increase on admission take place earlier than expected, but the news was quietly released less than 24 hours before the changes took effect. Previously, Disney has announced such information on its official blog. The price increase also comes shortly before Magic Kingdom will complete its New Fantasyland expansion by opening of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train; that opening will occur in time for early summer crowds. Disney World has raised the one-day ticket price to the Magic Kingdom by $4 so that it now costs $99 before taxes for visitors over age 9. Costly: Some analysts estimate that Disney has spent more than $1 billion on MyMagic+, which Disney once hoped to have fully launched last year . Single-day tickets for the resort's other parks — Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom — also went up by $4. It now costs $94 to get into those parks for visitors over age 9. For children under age 10, the cost is $93 to get into the Magic Kingdom and $88 to enter the other parks. Disney spokeswoman Kim Prunty says the pricing reflects the high quality of the parks. She also says that most guests buy multi-day tickets, which are considerably cheaper per day . This is the second price hike in less than a year. 'It's all about supply and demand,' writes Deb Wills, editor-in-chief of AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. 'Attendance is going up, not down; so as long as people keep paying the prices, Disney (any business) will keep raising them.' Magic Kingdom: While last year's price hikes hit visitors to Walt Disney World as well as Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim, the latest increase appears confined to Florida . The prices are hard to swallow  especially may be a bit hard to swallow, since Disney posted record profits during its previous fiscal quarter. It’s also hard for families, since they also have to pay for high-priced food and expensive souvenirs. Universal Orlando also raised its prices last summer where a one-day, one-park ticket is $92.","Disney's Magic Kingdom prices are going up .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A care worker who scooped £1 million on the lottery told today she bought the lucky scratch card in desperation - after discovering she was down to her last £20. Bride-to-be Jackie Murphy won the bumper payout on a Millionaire 777s scratch card on August 23 after finished a 12-hour minimum-wage shift. The shopper had just £11.52 in her bank account when she took a punt and spent £5 of the £10 note she had in her pocket on the lucky scratch card. Scroll down for video . Jackie Murphy, right, was down to her last £20 when she bought the lucky scratch card last Saturday from a local newsagent, pictured alongside her fiance John Potter, left, who she plans to marry next month . The happy couple, pictured, had been saving for months for their budget wedding but are now having a free bar . And she said she hasn't stopped beaming since scooping the jackpot, but won't let the money change her life. The 61-year-old, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, is to wed fiance John Potter next month. But the thrifty pair say their new found riches wont change their marital plans as her bridesmaids will accompany her down the isle in dresses from Matalan. Ms Murphy, who bought the scratch card from News Express in their home town, said: 'You cannot change the habits of a lifetime. 'I earn the minimum wage as a carer. It takes me an hour to earn gross the cost of the scratchcard so it isn't something I buy frequently. I don't know why I decided to last Saturday. 'We won't be splashing out on things but we will be able to be a bit more secure. 'At first I thought, well if I don't win anything at least I will get my fiver back as that is a given on the Millionaire 777s. 'But when I saw I had won £1 million I just could not believe it. I had to sit down and take a deep breath. 'I decided to buy a scratchcard on Saturday afternoon from News Express in Shawbury. 'I got back in to the car, scratched it and just sat there in disbelief before dashing back in to the store to get it checked. 'I gave it to the shop assistant who scanned it for me before asking her if it was really worth £1 million. 'Her smile got bigger, before she said it was worth a million at which point I started to get a bit weak at the knees. 'The store manager and another chap who was fixing the phone lines at the shop helped me in to the office before the manager phoned the National Lottery for me. 'We couldn't immediately confirm all the details, but it didn't take too much longer to get the amazing news that I was indeed a millionaire. 'I asked my fiance to come home as soon as possible but he said he couldn't as he hadn't patched the hole in the roof. 'I told him I had won £1 million but he didn't believe me. 'I then panicked because I thought about the fact he was on a roof and asked the shop manager to speak to him. Needless to say everything was fine. 'Since winning on Saturday we have both lost about half a stone each in weight as we have just been too excited to eat.' The couple, who have been together for 10 years, had been busily preparing for their wedding next month prior to the win. The couple have said that their good fortune will not change them, apart from driving a new Peugeot sports car . Her mother, Alma Green, 89, had bought Ms Murphy's wedding dress in the Monsoon sale, her shoes are from Tesco and the bridesmaids will be wearing dresses from Matalan. They will be getting wed at a registry office with a reception held at a nearby hotel and they are not changing their plans for the wedding - apart from a free bar for all the guests. Ms Murphy, who has splurged on a new £25,000 Peugeot RCZ sportscar, added: 'I have really enjoyed organising the wedding. 'I know that what we have organised will be wonderful so why change it just because we have won this money? 'I have decided to splash out on wedding flowers and posies and balloons which I wasn't going to have but that and the free bar is all that has changed.' The couple, who were presented with their winning cheque in front of friends and family including John's daughter Katie, 28, and son Joe, 24 , and Jackie's sons Carl, 41, and Steven, 39, at the Albrighton Hall Hotel, near Shrewsbury, had saved tirelessly over the past few months but haven't booked a honeymoon prior to the win as they could not afford one.","Jackie Murphy had just completed a 12-hour shift when chanced her luck .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . It's the viral campaign that's taken social media by storm with world-wide support from celebrities and dignitaries alike. Thanks to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, Motor Neurone Disease Australia has received more than $832,000 worth of donations when the campaign came down under on August 10. And the figures continue to be mind-blowing as Daily Mail Australia can reveal the donations recorded from the past couple of weeks are 26 times more than funds from last year. Scroll down for video . Celebrities partake in the ALS ice bucket challenge, which has gained worldwide support . Aussie singer Kylie Minogue and fashion designer Stefano Gabbana jump on board the ice bucket challenge . Actor Chris Hemsworth takes on the viral challenge which launched in Australia on August 10 . The viral challenge for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), which is known as MND (motor neurone disease) in Australia, kicked off in the U.S. late July. Dr Moira O'Connor says it's a long way until a cure for MND is found . Since it launched in Australia just over two weeks ago, a grand figure of $832,450.20 was donated to MNDA by 20,419 people. 'It's been absolutely mind-blowing,' a MNDA spokeswoman said, noting that it's been by far the biggest year of donations for the organisation. With about 1,900 Australians affected by MND, researchers and families finally feel as though they've been given a voice through the highly successful awareness campaign for the progressive and terminal neurological disease. Half of the donations will go towards MNDA's research arm, the MND Research Institute of Australia. 'MNDRIA allocates funds to the best research with the greatest chance of increasing our understanding of MND, and moving us closer to finding an effective treatment and cure for the disease,' Janet Nash, MNDA's Executive Officer Research, said. While Perth senior researcher Dr Moira O'Connor says 'effective treatment and a cure is inevitably a long way off', more research is needed into providing support for MND patients and also families. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young tipping the bucket on herself in Canberra . Australian plus-size model Robyn Lawley accepts the ice bucket challenge . 'MND gradually weakens the muscles as people lose their ability to talk, walk, swallow and eventually lose their ability to function,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Dr O'Connor, from Curtin University's School of Psychology and Speech Pathology, is focusing on the psychological effects to support the emotional well-being of both patients and carers. 'While patients feel flat and loss of hope carers also feel depressed because they have little control of the unpredictable symptoms and the physical burden of the job is quite demanding,' she said. 'There are good services available but always room for improvement to ensure a positive journey for all and to ensure people don’t fall through the cracks, maintaining positive attitude . Dr O'Connor said about five to 10 per cent of cases are inherited with the disease commonly affects males and those in the 50 to 60 age bracket. 'We hope the donations keep on coming, even when the viral campaigns fades out,' she said. 'We're still a long way from finding a cure so we hope MND isn't forgotten and people keep their ongoing commitment.'","Motor neurone disease  is a progressive and terminal neurological disease .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Michael Jones, 55, has been charged with murder after allegedly smuggling methadone-laced underpants into jail and handing  them to a cellmate, who police say overdosed . An inmate at a jail in Kentucky has died after eating methadone-soaked underwear that was smuggled into prison by a cellmate. Michael Jones, 55, was let out on day release from Jessamine County Detention Center, Nicholasville, and allegedly brought back the drug-laced underpants, which went undetected by prison guards. Police believer Jones cut up the briefs and shared them with his cellmates, including Corey McQueary, 33, who was found unresponsive on Thursday morning. McQueary was pronounced dead later that day. The results of his autopsy are yet to be released but police suspect he died of a drug overdose. Jailer Jon Sallee told CNN: 'When somebody comes in the facility either from a furlough or any other occurrence, they're searched, their clothing's searched, strip searched, any other type of search that we feel is necessary. 'If something is in their garment and it's colorless, odorless, it would be very difficult, almost impossible, to detect from the naked eye.' Jones, who was on a furlough to attend a funeral, was arrested and charged with murder after the incident. It is believed that McQueary was in the Kentucky detention center awaiting trial for manufacturing methamphetamine. Methadone is an opiate drug which is used both as a painkiller and as a heroin replacement for users trying to wean themselves off the substance. It slows down body function and reduces physical and psychological pain. When taken properly by heroin addicts, the dosage of methadone is slowly decreased over time so the user avoids withdrawal symptoms. Overdosing on methadone can cause users to fall into a coma, suffer respiratory failure and die.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Roberto Calderoli has reignited a race row after claiming he had been placed under a curse following his remarks comparing the country's first black minister to an orangutan . An Italian politician who faced calls to resign after comparing the country's first black minister to an orangutan has now claimed to have been put under a curse by her father. Roberto Calderoli, deputy speaker of Italy's Senate and former minister of the anti-immigrant Northern League party, made the remarks  about Integration Minister Cecile Kyenge last year. After inviting widespread criticism and condemnation with the comments the politician said he had no intention of resigning and offered only a qualified apology. Mr Calderoli, who is currently facing prosecution over the remarks, has now caused further outrage after he blamed a series of misfortunes on a curse and claimed he needs to find an exorcist. According to The Telegraph, Mr Calderoli tweeted: 'I don't know if I should put an advert in the paper or call (Pope Francis) directly, but I must absolutely find an exorcist.' The politician has said he has suffered a series of unfortunate events, including the death of his mother and six hospital operations, since Miss Kyenge's father led a ceremony in the Democractic Republic of Congo. During the ceremony, which was filmed by gossip magazine Oggi, Clement Kyenge, 75, prayed to God to free Mr Calderoli of evil thoughts and attempted to contact the village's ancestors. Mr Calderoli told Oggi, as cited by The Independent, that the the video was 'unsettling'. According to The Local, Mr Calderoli said: 'I’ve never been superstitious but after this, things started happening more and more.' Mr Kyenge has denied placing a curse on Mr Calderoli. After sparking outrage with the remarks in July last year, Mr Calderoli offered only a qualified apology. He said: ‘I did not mean to offend and if minister Kyenge was offended I am sorry, but my comment was made within a much broader political speech that criticised the minister and her policies.' After hours of nearly universal condemnation and extensive coverage by the international media, Mr Calderoli called Ms Kyenge in the evening to apologise directly. Cecile Kyenge, a Congolese-born doctor who has lived in Italy since 1983, became Integration Minister in April last year . She had done well to become a minister, he said, but ‘perhaps she should do it in her own country’. Ms Kyenge is a Congolese-born doctor who has lived in Italy since 1983 and became a minister in April last year. Italy's then-Prime Minister Enrico Letta denounced the comments as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘beyond every limit’. Several ministers also said Mr Calderoli should step down from his Senate position.","Roberto Calderoli caused outrage by comparing Cecile Kyenge to orangutan .

Alongside middle-aged men in unsightly Speedos and the obligatory lobster-coloured Britons, visitors to the island have been shocked to see a seal languishing on sun loungers or frolicking in the waves. While monk seals normally choose quiet caves and peaceful coves as resting sites, this seal - named ‘Argiro’ by local fishermen - prefers the company of humans and has chosen a spot on some of the most bustling beaches on the island, even upgrading herself to a sunbed, on occasion. Scroll down for video . Beach goers are surprised to learn they will be sharing the sand with a monk seal called Argiro . First spotted in March, and one of only 450 remaining monk seals worldwide, at first the team from the Archipelagos Institute attempted to deter attention and minimize human disturbance for Argiro. However Argiro’s sociable nature made this impossible, and the Archipelagos Institute team and its volunteers is therefore using Argiro’s presence to raise awareness of the endangered species and the conservation work they are undertaking to protect it. The team hope Argiro will return to her natural habitat of her own accord, but in the meantime, they are on hand to advise visitors to the beach on how to behave around Argiro as a means of protecting her. Any efforts to minimise Argiro's contact with humans has been scarped by her sociable nature . The team hope Argiro, who is one of only 450 monk seals, will return to her natural habitat of her own accord . Efforts to minimise human contact have involved close collaboration with an extensive network of volunteers from the local community including fishermen, farmers, tourism professionals, students and teachers, as well as valuable assistance from the local port authorities. ‘The Archipelagos Institute will do everything it can to ensure the protection of Argiro. This seal has served as an excellent ambassador for her species and reminds us that, as in ancient Greece, all wildlife – particularly seals and dolphins – can coexist in harmony with humans,’ says Archipelagos Institute director, Thodoris Tsimpidis.","A seal has been enjoying the beach next to tourists in Samos, Greece .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Mark Yeeles was jailed for six years at Newcastle Crown Court . An internet blackmailer forced a teenage girl to perform an eight hour rape reenactment with her friend over webcam, threatening to send her family naked photographs of her if she refused. Mark Yeeles was jailed for six years for preying on the victims who have been left in need of psychiatric care. The 20-year-old from South Shields was told he had 'ruined their lives' as he was jailed for the sickening incident. Newcastle Crown Court heard how Yeeles threatened 'your family are going to love a naked picture or two' when the girl tried to ignore his requests. The teenager was on the brink of suicide when he ordered her to carry out the eight-our rape re-enactment online. He admitted blackmail, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and possessing indecent images. Judge Guy Whitburn said the man had 'ruined' the girls' lives. 'It is quite clear you were reminding her from time to time of the power you held over her to post naked pictures of her where her friends and family would see them. 'It is clear she knew she was being blackmailed. 'It was well thought out, it was deliberate and utterly heartless.' 'These girls who are particularly vulnerable, very young, they have to be protected from the consequences of their own folly.' The court heard Yeeles approached his young victim over the internet after coming across a photograph of her in her underwear. He used the image to threaten her into taping sordid videos, promising to delete them all once she had done what he told her. When he told her to involve a friend, he instructed: 'convince her, for your sake'. The 20-year-old was jailed for six years at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) by a judge said he had 'ruined' the lives of the young girls . Prosecuting Gavin Doig said: 'The defendant manipulated her, promising he would leave her alone if she complied then failed to do so. 'They both performed for Yeeles, he was instructing them what to do. 'He was continuing to threaten to publish images if not satisfied with their performance.' Afterwards, he sent one of the girls a photograph of the event, but did not make other contact for around a year. When he resurfaced they called the police. Vic Laffey, defending, said: 'He would not say boo to a goose but under the cover of the internet he was able to present himself as something he simply isn’t. 'There is no doubt he feels genuine remorse. 'He didn’t realise the torment he was putting people through but he does now.'","Mark Yeeles threatened girl with photograph of her in her underwear .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A Banksy artwork which was stencilled on a wall outside a cash-strapped youth club has been sold to a private collector for £403,000. Mobile Lovers, showing a couple embracing while checking their mobile phones, appeared next to Broad Plain Boys' Club in Bristol in April. The piece, attached to a piece of wood and screwed to the wall, was removed by members of the youth club with a crowbar. 'Mobile lovers': The stencil created by Banksy, that mysteriously appeared next to a boys' club in April, has sold for £403,000 to a private collector in the UK . Emerged: The artwork was completed overnight next to the Broad Plain Boys' Club, Bristol. It was identified as a Banksy piece when the artist posted an image on his website . Club owner Dennis Stinchcombe then moved the piece to a corridor and invited members of the public to come and view it, with donations optional. The  youth group, who needed to find £120,000 just to stay open after struggling due to the recession, insisted Banksy wanted them to have it and planned to sell the work to fund the future of the club - which has been open for 120 years. But within days, police removed the stencil and handed it to the city council, which put it on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery while its ownership was established. The exhibition attracted more than 10,000 people in its first weekend. Display: Members of the cash-strapped club removed it with a crowbar and placed in a corridor. They then invited the public to view the piece, with donations optional . 'Blessing': After the artwork was moved to the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, the club's owner Denis Stinchcombe received this letter from the artist, saying they could do 'what you feel is right' with the piece . However, Mr Stinchcombe then received a letter from the elusive artist, stating that 'as far as I'm concerned, you can have it'. It read: 'As you know I recently painted on a doorway near the club. This was mean to be a small gift to the area but apparently a financial one would have been more useful. 'I don't normally admit to committing criminal damage, but seeing as it looks like charges won't be brought any time soon, you have my blessing to do what you feel is right with the piece.' The following day the city's Mayor George Ferguson received a similar letter confirming it was genuine. After confirming the origin of the correspondence, Mr Ferguson tweeted: 'Just received confirmation by #Banksy that note to #Bristol Broad Plain Boys Club is authentic.

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . and Reuters . Harold Hamm is an unlikely billionaire: the 13th child of Oklahoma sharecroppers whose identity as a self-made man could just be his downfall in his impending divorce battle. Hamm, the founder and CEO of Continental Resources, is the world's 34th-richest person in the world, with a personal fortune of an estimated $20.3 billion. The oilman is in the second week of a divorce hearing from his wife of 25 years, Sue Ann, and experts say the only way he can avoid paying half of his assets - and possibly losing a controlling share of his company - is to argue that his fortune is the result of sheer dumb luck. Oil baron: Harold Hamm, Oklahoma oil man and 68 per cent stake holder in Continental Resources Inc., stands to lose up to $8.5 billion in his divorce settlement . Power couple: Harold Hamm and Sue Ann Hamm attend the TIME 100 Gala celebrating TIME'S 100 Most Influential People In The World. In order to hold on to his fortune, Hamm will claim that his fortune was acquired through luck rather than business acumen . The amount divisible in the divorce settlement is $17 billion. Legally, if Hamm can prove that the appreciation of the marital assets was passive, rather than an active attempt by him to increase his wealth, then they will remain his property. 'You have a piece of vacant land before you get married, a separate property. If you do nothing about it and by passive acts it increases [in value], for instance they build a railroad next door or a road, fine, it’s passive,' prominent New York divorce attorney Raoul Felder told Yahoo Finance. 'But if you make a victory garden on there or you build a house, it’s now active.' In essence, for Hamm to keep the $17 billion in question, he would have to contradict the popular image of himself that he has projected for decades as an astute businessman and innovator and instead say he simply got lucky. The analysis of Kenneth Button, an expert witness hired by Hamm's wife Sue Ann, was laid out in court testimony and in a document provided to Reuters by Oklahoma County Judge Howard Haralson. It is one of the first pieces of financial testimony to be released from the trial, which has been conducted mostly in secrecy. Unusually for a divorce case, Haralson has barred the public from the courtroom on most days and sealed most of the evidence. He says he is trying to protect shareholders in Hamm's Continental Resources from the release of confidential business information. Through his 68 per cent stake in Continental, a leading driller in North Dakota, Harold Hamm is believed to own the most oil in the ground of any American. The family also worked to keep word of the divorce from going public. The case was originally titled Jane Doe vs. John Doe when Sue Ann filed the suit in 2012, alleging that her husband was unfaithful. The identity of the parties was only discovered in March of 2013. The couple was married in 1988 and has two daughters, Jane and Hillary, from the marriage. The family split its time between four homes, including a two-mansion family enclave in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma, with its own combination basketball and tennis court, which the couple bought in 2009. Harold Hamm also has three children from a marriage that ended in divorce in 1987. Behind closed doors, the case has had its own sensationalistic highlights. Sue Ann went through the trouble of installing surveillance equipment in the home beginning in 2007, according to court documents. One bill alone was to the tune of $9,866.09. Lawyers for Harold are demanding the 'home video or audio recordings' be turned over, in an attempt to show their separation effectively occurred before 2012. Sprawl: The son of a sharecropper, Harold Hamm eventually amassed a large enough fortune in the Bakken oil fields to buy two adjoining mansions in a posh area of Oklahoma . On the range: Harold and Sue Ann Hamm have two daughters, Jane and Hilary (pictru . The recently introduced document, a trial exhibit marked 'confidential business information,' is a 122-page report compiled by Button, a PhD economist. Haralson released the report after determining it isn’t subject to the protective order he has placed in the case. Button's report contends that up to $15 billion of the growth in Continental's market capitalization during the period he studied is 'active' marital capital, or subject to division between the spouses. Button crunched data from the years between the couple’s 1988 wedding and February 2014. Since then, Continental's value has grown by nearly $4 billion more, adding to the wealth the court may divide, Button said in court earlier in August. About $2.6 billion of that appreciation would accrue to Harold through his 68 per cent stake in Continental. All told, Button's analysis suggests that the marital capital subject to division could add up to some $17.6 billion. If Judge Haralson accepts Button's reasoning and awards Sue Ann a significant share of the marital estate, the Hamm split could yield the largest divorce settlement ever. If Hamm has to sell Continental shares to finance a large settlement, his control of the company could be eroded. Attorneys for Harold Hamm and for Continental didn't respond to questions from Reuters. Harold's witnesses will testify later in the trial, which began last week and is expected to end in October. What caused Continental's increase in value is critical to the outcome. Under Oklahoma law, any increase in the Hamms' net worth resulting from the active efforts of either spouse during the marriage is considered part of the marital estate. Sue Ann Hamm's legal team contends that this growth resulted largely from the active leadership and astute decision-making of Harold. He is widely credited as a pioneer in developing the Bakken Shale formation of North Dakota, America's largest oil discovery in decades. Harold's attorneys will try to show that Continental's growth resulted mostly from factors beyond his control. They signaled this strategy in their cross-examination of Button, pressing the economist to consider that external forces, such as higher oil prices and new drilling technologies, were decisive factors in Continental’s success. Button is trying to undercut Harold's position by comparing Continental's spectacular growth with that of rivals. The margin by which Continental's financial returns outpaced those of similar oil and gas companies should be considered Continental's 'active' appreciation, the Button report says. It compares Continental's financial returns to those of 76 other publicly traded U.S. independent drillers. Continental and these 'peer companies,' the report says, faced similar risks, opportunities and market conditions - such as fluctuating oil prices, choices among technologies and drilling locations, and methods to raise and deploy capital. Continental's return on investment was at least 44,271 per cent during the Hamm marriage, Button wrote. The average return among peers - extrapolated over the same period - was a relatively modest 691 per cent, the report says. Continental's outsize returns compared to its competitors are 'likely the results of difference over time in the specific operational decisions and actions of the management of these companies.' Hamm founded Continental in 1967, two decades before his marriage to Sue Ann, a former attorney at the company. Continental has said the divorce is a private matter that hasn't affected the business and isn't expected to. At the same time, Continental attorneys have submitted hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in the trial in support of Harold. They also have repeatedly persuaded the judge to seal evidence and close the courtroom to avoid damaging Continental's interests.","Harold Hamm and his wife Sue Ann are divorcing after 25 years of marriage .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A 41-year-old woman battered her musician boyfriend to death with a guitar stand during a drunken row, a court heard. Samantha Adeokun, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her partner Peter Davegun, 42, in a brutal attack on December 23 last year. Stafford Crown Court heard she flew into a rage and beat her boyfriend by kicking and punching him as he curled up in a ball to protect himself. Samantha Adeokun, 41, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her on/off partner of six years Peter Davegun, 42, (above) by punching, kicking and beating him with a metal guitar stand until he fell unconcious . He suffered multiple injuries to his head and body after also being bludgeoned with a metal guitar stand leaving behind 'a bloodbath', jurors were told. Emergency services arrived at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after Adeokun waited one hour to dial 999. She claimed her partner had fallen and hit his head on a TV stand after tripping on a mat. Paramedics arrived just before 2.45pm and found Mr Davegun's body lying in the foetal position on his bedroom floor. The court heard he had extensive bruising and bite marks on his body and had suffered severe internal injuries and seven fractured ribs. He was pronounced dead at the property at around 3.20pm. Adeokun went on trial yesterday accused of murdering her on-off partner of six years following the drunken row. Prosecutor Deborah Gould, opening the case, said: 'The prosecution case says the defendant literally beat him to death using her fists, feet and part of a guitar stand. Stafford Crown Court heard how 41-year-old Adeokun allegedly attacked her partner at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire (above) on December 23 last year during a drunken row. Mr Davegun died from his injuries . The court heard how Adeokun waited nearly one hour before calling emergency services after the alleged attack. When police arrived, Mr Davegun was found unconscious in a pool of blood and was pronounced dead . 'At least part of the time she was doing this, she was bleeding and standing above him. 'She struck him repeatedly, causing significant internal bruising and bleeding. She struck him from behind and from the front. 'You will hear from the pathologist that there's evidence he was struck while on the ground in the foetal position. 'After the attack, the defendant telephoned her daughter and said she was sorry. She said she and the deceased had a fight. 'She said she had been defending herself and Mr Davegun was, at that stage, unconscious. 'When her daughter asked if she had called 999, the defendant said she hadn't because she needed to get dressed because she had blood on her. 'She changed out of her clothing. Then, nearly an hour afterwards, she called paramedics, claiming Mr Davegun had fallen, hit his head and been unconscious for 40 minutes.' Adeokun denies murdering Mr Davegun and claims he fell and hit his head after tripping on a mat at the flat . The jury also heard a recording of the 999 call Adeokun made during which she described the scene as a 'bloodbath'. She told the operator: 'We had a big argument earlier on and he's just fell. 'I cut my finger and it looks bad. I cut my finger and it looks like I've killed him.' Adeokun denies murder. The trial continues.

"By . Paul Harris for the Daily Mail . For more than two years her greatest pleasure in life has been feeding the birds in the garden. Pensioner Frances Cheatham watches every morning with binoculars from her kitchen window as they tuck in to the seeds and nuts she puts out for them. Most days the 71-year-old former driving instructor also enjoys listening to the birdsong that echoes around the communal grounds and sheltered accommodation she shares with other residents. Heartbroken: Frances Cheatham, 71, has been banned from feeding the birds in the garden of Leyfield Court in Chester, because the housing association said they were 'health hazards' But the kind-hearted Bird Lady has found herself in a showdown with her neighbours and authorities – after being ordered to stop. An investigation involving police, an environmental health specialist and housing trust officials highlighted potential ‘health hazards’ and concluded she risked spreading disease. She was then called to a housing trust meeting attended by a police officer to discuss the bird feeding and neighbour complaints. Yesterday Miss Cheatham accused officials of ‘bullying’ tactics and refused to take down her hanging feeders at Leyfield Court in Lache, Cheshire, which is run by the Chester and District Housing Trust. She told the Daily Mail it was a ‘harmless pastime’ that had given her years of enjoyment – and pledged she would stand her ground. She added: ‘I’ve got about five feeders on the go. I take good care of them and spend lots of happy times feeding the birds. So I couldn’t believe it when I got this letter telling me to stop doing it, and inviting me to a meeting. ‘I found out that one of the housing officers even phoned my brother – I think they wanted to find out if I had any mental issues. Well, I haven’t got any mental issues – I just love birds. I feel I’m being persecuted for doing something that millions of people do every day.’ Miss Cheatham, a divorcee, conceded there had been long-running hostility after a neighbour objected to and removed two bird tables she had installed. Since then she has set up hanging feeders in the garden, which she claims hardly anyone else ventures into. Miss Cheatham accused officials of 'bullying' tactics claiming that it was 'a harmless past time' Stunned: The pensioner, who lives alone in the retirement flats, received a letter from Chester & District Housing Trust (CDHT) saying she was 'spreading disease' RSPB spokesman Chris Collett said: ‘As long as people practise good hygiene with their feeders, there shouldn’t be a problem. It’s a very positive thing to do.’ A spokesman for the housing trust’s parent company, Sanctuary, said police were at the meeting because of ‘wider issues’ arising from neighbours’ allegations and complaints about other matters. Sanctuary executive Christa Ripley said in a statement there had been ‘numerous’ complaints about the feathers, droppings, dust and seeds in the communal garden. ‘We fully appreciate that she enjoys her time feeding birds, but using the communal area to do so is causing a disruption to other residents, which we need to consider.’ 'Only enjoyment': Mrs Cheatham has been feeding the birds with her own money. She says one of her 'few pleasures' in life has now been taken away from her .","Frances Cheatham, 71, lays out food every day in Leyfield Court, Chester .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . It seems that a simple face lift or sprinkling of Botox just doesn't cut it in the quest for perfection that's gripping our society. This year has been all about the bacial (that's a bum facial), ear-tox (yes, Botox for your ears) and freckle removal. And if you thought those were strange, it's about to get a whole lot weirder. Cosmetic doctors believe that Brazilian bum sculpting, knee peels and 'Cinderella surgery' - Botox for your feet - will take our vain nation by storm next year. Whatever next? Cosmetic doctors believe that Brazilian bum sculpting, knee peels and  Botox for your feet are going to be everyone's favourite way to beautify in the coming years . One treatment already making waves in the cosmetic world is ear-tox. The latest beauty craze may be music to your ears…or more specifically, your earlobes, if you've always loved dangly earrings. Ear rejuvenation, also known as ‘ear-tox’, is a new cosmetic surgery procedure which uses dermal fillers injected into the earlobe to plump them back up where heavy earrings may have left them saggy and wrinkled. The procedure is proving popular with women over 40, with many who have had the procedure claiming that it has 'changed their lives'. Dr. Carolyn Berry, Medical Director and Founder of Firvale Clinic, Southampton, said: 'Women who haven’t had the confidence to wear their hair up for years suddenly have that option. I would never have believed that it was possible to make that much difference to their self-esteem until I saw the results myself.' For the image-conscious men out there,  the newest beauty trend is laser side burn removal, and according to clinics, it’s becoming increasingly popular. Is that really necessary? Ear rejuvenation, also known as 'eartox', is a new cosmetic surgery procedure which uses dermal fillers injected into the earlobe to plump them back up . Samantha Munoz, Aesthetic Practitioner at Juvea Aesthetics, Harley Street, said: 'Laser hair removal uses light energy to destroy the hair follicle and ensure it doesn't grow back. We recommend around six treatments for permanent hair reduction. 'If you are worried about the pain, then don’t - the popularity of this treatment is a testament to the fact that it is effective and causes minimal discomfort. Many who have undergone this treatment say that it feels like the snap of a rubber band.' ‘Cinderella Surgery’ is another procedure that aims to cure the most common problem faced by heel-lovers - a condition known as ‘Stillettotarsal’, which occurs when pain hits the soft tissue on the ball of the foot. The cure? Botox in the feet. Some women are even going so far as to have fat inserted into the soles of their feet to allow them to walk more comfortably in heels. We like big butts: Brazilian bottoms have been the major cause of envy, and this has resulted in a new bottom enhancing surgery craze that claims to make the derrière 'bouncier' It is also reported that some have requested (and been denied) liposuction on their toes. Foot fillers have also become increasingly popular among women in a bid to make heels more comfy - adding an extra cushion to the ball of the foot along with so-called ‘Cinderella Surgery’, a procedure which alters women’s feet to improve their appearance. If women aren't fretting over their feet, they're preoccupied with their bottoms. Brazil suffered a humiliating defeat when Germany annihilated them 7-1 in the semi-finals of The World Cup, but the South American country is a sure winner of the battle of the behinds. Brazilian bottoms have been the major cause of envy, and this has resulted in a new bottom enhancing surgery craze. Renowned for their big, round bottoms, more and more women around the world are opting for cosmetic procedures in order to compete with Brazilian babes. Dr. Raj Tanna has noticed a huge surge in popularity from British ladies at his Suffolk practice. He said: 'Different people want different bums. Some want a flatter bum, some want a bigger bum, some want theirs lifted, some want theirs lowered. 'More and more women all over the world are opting for cosmetic procedures to make their bums big and bouncy just like the Brazilians; also known as butt sculpting. 'Butt sculpting can be achieved by a new machine called Lipofirm Plus, which permanently removes fat cells as well as tightening and firming the skin around your butt. Improving ourselves: It seems that a simple face lift or sprinkling of Botox just doesn't cut it in the quest for perfection that's gripping our society - and we are going to extreme lengths to achieve beauty . 'I use liposculpting with the Lipofirm Plus machine over the lateral parts of the bum, combined with radiofrequency to lift it. I also sculpt the saddlebag area and thighs to ensure the bum looks the best it possibly can. A lot of practices only sculpt the thigh area, with hopes that it will make the bum look better, but I prefer a more rounded approach - excuse the pun.' Peels for the face used be all the rage, but now, women have taken to knee peeling. Many Caucasian women have pink knees, while many women of colour have brown or even greyish areas on their knees, say Harley Street doctors. Aneequa Bhatti, skin specialist at Juvea Aesthetics explains: 'Many people with ethnic skin types may find that areas such as the knees or elbows are slightly darker than the rest of the body and wish to lighten them for a more even skin tone all over. This can be due to dryness as well as melanin in the skin. 'Knee peels are also a great way to reduce mild scarring or blemishes on the knees too.'","Botox and fillers for your feet will be big news, claim surgeons .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Blinded: Burglars sprayed Jack the border collie as they looted his owners' home in Shaw, Greater Manchester, earlier this month . Burglars blinded a puppy by spraying ammonia in its face as they ransacked its owners' house for £10,000 worth of valuables. It is thought the criminals attacked Jack the border collie when he began barking at them as they looted the home of Graham and Jean Wharmby in Shaw, Oldham, Greater Manchester earlier this month. After spraying the one-year-old dog with the toxic liquid, the burglars took off with £10,000 worth of valuables, including three laptops, a mobile phone and Mrs Wharmby's mother's wedding ring - which had been in her family for four generations. Police are now looking for the criminals, who targeted the two-bedroom bungalow while Mr and Mrs Wharmby, both 60, were out grocery shopping. Mrs Wharmby, who is terminally ill following treatment for cancer, said: 'It's unbelievable the depths some yobs will stoop to simply to rob people's homes. 'It's . a wonder he's not blind and if we had been any longer Jack could have . passed out from power the fumes. 'It's just wrong what these people did . and so s cruel. They must have gone in the kitchen looking for stuff . because he is in there when we go out. 'They could have quite easily . have left him. He would have barked at them when he heard them and would . have jumped up. They must have got him first to get him away. 'We were . only out of the house for just over an hour and it was the first time . I'd been out for four months due to illness. They must have been . watching the house. 'It was so callous. I doubt these yobboes have any conscience whatsoever. ' Jack was treated by a vet before returning home, where Mrs Wharmby said he is now recovering well from the attack. Tests revealed that his blindness was only temporary. The raid took place between 10.30am and 11.30am on 15 August after Mr and Mrs Wharmby went out to buy groceries. It is thought the burglars forced open a dining room window before creeping into the house. Mrs Wharmby, a former professional cake maker, added: 'When we came back we could smell the Ammonia straight away and we could see all the cupboard doors were open and the bedrooms ransacked. 'Jack was still wagging his tail and came to the door but it was clear he couldn't see properly. They had come armed with this and taken it back with them. 'Ammonia was all over the floor in the kitchen and we couldn't come into the house until the fire brigade had come. Loyal: Mrs Wharmby said that one-year-old Jack was still wagging his tail when she returned home with her husband. The burglars took £10,000 worth of valuables in the raid . 'Jack was trying to wipe his eyes but his paws had been in it - his eyes were all ulcerated especially his left one. They even got ambulance for Graham because of the fumes. The fire brigade came in with all the breathing equipment, we couldn't go in the house for an hour. 'Jack's coat was covered in ammonia and he had to be put outside. The RSPCA came and he had to have his eyes cleaned. They put a dye in to see how bad it was. His eyes were a bluish colour. 'It has made his eyes discoloured and we thought he would be blinded. He is a poor defenceless animal. Now if he hears any noises or if people pass he barks, he's very protective of me. 'He is only 12 months old, he is still only a puppy. He is very nice natured. I dread to think what they might have done if I was there.' Irreplaceable: The burglars took a gold watch belonging to Mrs Wharmby's grandmother as well as her mother's wedding ring, which had been in her family for four generations . She explained that the beloved dog now has to have eye drops four times a day. She said that the police had never known an animal to be targeted in a similar attack. She continued: 'They had ransacked the bedrooms and taken all my jewellery from the boxes and safety boxes including my mum's wedding ring. They had broken open the boxes with a screwdriver. 'The jewellery was sentimental but it was Jack who we were more bothered about. He has been such a good companion to me and he doesn't like me being on my own. He has helped with my illness. I couldn't bear to think of life without him. Recovering: Jack the border collie, pictured at 12 weeks old, was treated for the painful injuries he suffered to his eyes before returning home, where he is now recovering well from the attack . 'They have taken my grandma's gold watch and my emeralds and diamonds and sapphire rings. 'They also took my mum's wedding ring which was four generations old as she had my great grandma's, my grandma's wedding ring melted to make hers. There was also three laptops and an i-Phone. 'I think they must have seen us coming back and left. One of the neighbour's saw two men round the back, a young one with a hoodie and an older one. I'm now too frightened of going out.' PC Tom Nicholson of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Not only did the homeowners come back to see their house had been broken into but their beloved dog had been needlessly sprayed in the face with ammonia. Desperate: Jack, pictured at six months old, was rubbing his eyes with his paws when an inspector from the RSPCA arrived at the two-bedroomed bungalow. She said that the pet looked like it was in great pain . 'The dog was in a lot of pain, had injuries to the eyes and was temporarily blinded.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A thief who allegedly set three buildings alight tried to escape on a pensioner's canal cruiser - but was forced to give up when he became entangled in Britain's longest lock system. The man had apparently jumped on board the cruiser to try and flee the trail of destruction he had left behind him. But he got stuck when he approached the Caen Hill lock, near Devizes in Wiltshire, Britain's longest lock system, which takes up to six hours to clear. Scroll down for video . The canal cruiser (pictured) belonging to Lionel Gordon, 77, was stolen and then set alight . A thief who stole a canal cruiser got stuck when he approached the Caen Hill lock (pictured) in Wiltshire . Despite clearing four of the 29 locks, the fugitive allegedly turned the boat around and then set it on fire. Pip Flowers, watch manager in charge of Devizes fire station, said: 'It was a very strange night. I don't think we have ever had a trail of arsons quite like it. 'It seems the arsonist thought they could escape on the boat but hadn't reckoned with the Caen Hill flight. 'They went through about four locks leaving them open so that water was escaping and then decided to turn around. 'When we got there it didn't take a lot of putting out. We used the hose reels and two guys in breathing apparatus went inside.' The man reportedly first set alight a bag of rubbish inside a derelict outbuilding in the grounds of St Peter's School, Devizes, on the evening of July 4. A shed was then set alight, which saw the fire spread to the roof of an old stables building, before a third blaze was started on a petrol mower in the early hours of the morning. The thief then allegedly left two violins and a bicycle on a bed and breakfast driveway, before the boat was taken from its moorings at the bottom of the garden. Caen Hill Locks are a flight of locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal, between Rowde and Devizes in Wiltshire . Boat owner Lionel Gordon, 77, said he was 'very upset' his prized possession had been stolen then torched. He said: 'I was asked if I knew where my boat was. It was then I found out it had been stolen. I was very upset as I was preparing it to go to a number of regattas. 'From the outside the boat does not look too bad but when you go down in the cabin everything is burnt and blackened.' Mr Gordon, who is a great-grandfather, bought the boat six years ago when he moved to Devizes. Among the possessions destroyed was his Merchant Navy cap and badge he earned when he signed up as a 15-year-old. 'I was very sad to lose those and other things such as the flags from the boat were stolen,' he added. 'The boat is my pride and joy. I don't know how long it is going to take to repair.' A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson, burglary and theft of a motor vehicle. He has been released on police bail. Completed in 1810, the two mile stretch of 29 continuous gates are a flight of locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal, between Rowde and Devizes in Wiltshire. The locks have a rise of 237 feet and form a two mile stretch. The lower seven locks run from the Foxhangers Wharf lock to the Foxhangers Bridge lock. The next 16 locks form a steep flight in a straight line up the hillside. This flight of locks was engineer John Rennie's solution to climbing the very steep hill, and was the last part of the canal to be completed. A picture of the  lock in 1977 when it was closed - it re-opened in 1990 after a major restoration effort . Each side pond holds a million gallons of water - about two Olympic-sized pools worth. The locks are one of the 'Seven Wonders of the Waterways'. They take five to six hours to travel in a boat and lock 41 is the narrowest on the canal. The locks became derelict in the 1950s, but after a strong campaign against closure of the canal, followed by a major restoration effort, were reopened by The Queen in August 1990. The wood from the old gates was donated to Glastonbury Festival and used to build a new bridge which was named in honour of Arabella Churchill, one of the festival's founder.","A thief who allegedly set three buildings alight tried to escape on a pensioner's canal cruiser .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . A father-of-two left with horrific face and body injuries in a random acid attack has told how his life has been devastated. Darren Pidgeon, 27, was seriously injured in what police believe was a completely unprovoked assault as he drove through a town centre late at night. A stranger approached his car in Rayleigh, Essex in June and sprayed acid through his window. The attacker then repeatedly punched  Mr Pidgeon, who fell out of his car screaming after managing to fight off his assailant. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Darren Pidgeon was the victim of a completely unprovoked late-night acid attack in Essex earlier this summer . He says the random attack, which hospitalised him for a month and almost left him blind, has ruined his life (pictured left just after the attack, and as he appears now right) Doctors expect the healing process to take two years, but Mr Pidgeon says the scarring he has been left with from the attack has ruined his life . The ordeal left him with scarring down his entire right side and injuries that will affect him for the rest of his life. He feared he may never see his children's faces again but, luckily, he was not blinded by the corrosive liquid. Police said they can find no motive for the attack  and are appealing for more witnesses. Mr Pidgeon, a carer from Rayleigh, said: 'It was just an unprovoked attack and it has really ruined my life. 'It has put me out of work and now I have to wear make-up to cover the scars. It's embarrassing. When I was attacked I had no idea what was happening and I was confused more than anything. Mr Pidgeon was hospitalised  for a month. Skin had to be taken from his leg to repair his face, and he was left with scars covering the rest of his body . He has now told how he feared he would never see his children's faces again following the horrific attack (pictured just after the attack, during his recovery, and as he appears today) 'I didn't know why this guy was doing it. I was just screaming ""my eyes, my eyes"" and I was in excruciating pain.' He added: 'At first I thought it might have been pepper spray but it was much worse than that. 'It was just a burning feeling. I felt like my face was just melting off. I can't understand why someone would want to do that to another human being.' The attack left Mr Pidgeon hospitalised for a month and he had multiple skin grafts with tissue from his leg used to rebuild his damaged face. He is currently undergoing physiotherapy to heal his arm and must exercise his face to prevent him losing his facial expressions. Doctors expect the healing to take two years but Mr Pidgeon, who has now moved to London due to the attack, said the effects will last a lifetime. He added: 'Part of me feels like there's no reason to go on anymore. I've got permanent scars and it is all down my face, my arm, my shoulder, my back. Medical experts fear the scars to Mr Pidgeon's face and side will take at least two years to heal . Police initially believed the attack was related to a road rage incident, but have since ruled that out . Mr Pidgeon is undergoing physiotherapy to retain movement in his arm, and must exercise his face otherwise he will lose the ability to make facial expressions . 'My skin feels like rubber now. I touch it and I think I have a mask on or something. 'I have lost my job, I have had to move out because my mum gets upset and we argue. Everything has been destroyed. 'I've got no money so I can't afford any plastic surgery but the thing I want most is just for this guy to be caught. If you are going to let this happen to somebody you have got to suffer too.' Police initially thought the incident was a road rage attack after an altercation at a roundabout but they have since ruled out that theory. They are now appealing for information about a suspect who is 5ft 8ins to 5ft 10ins tall, slim with short, light coloured hair. He was wearing a light grey polo shirt, blue denim jeans and a black hoodie. Det Sgt Mike Calvert said: 'This was an unprovoked attack, which has caused appalling injuries to the victim.'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . According to the film Back to the Future Part II, 2015 is supposed to be the year of the flying car. But if you're thinking that flying cars arriving as early as next year sounds a bit far-fetched, then you might want to check out proposals from Eduardo Galvani. He claims his design, known as the Fly Citycopter, could be the air-borne method of transport we were promised by Doc Brown and Marty McFly's time travelling exploits. We have all imagined the concept of flying cars whizzing past us in the future. This idea has been explored by scientists and certainly in futuristic films, however Eduardo Galvani has taken the idea a step further with his creation called the Fly Citycopter (pictured) The Fly Citycopter is essentially a personal helicopter designed to transport us around cities in a much more efficient and eco-friendly way than relying on driving or waiting for a bus. Portable nuclear fusion reactors . Flying cars . Self-tying shoes . Changeable window scenery . Weather forecasts accurate to the second . Self-drying clothes . Automated petrol stations . Hoverboards . Galvani said for now, he hopes that this concept will inspire creative people working within the transportation industry to consider developing alternative means of eco-friendly travel in crowded places. The designer noticed that urban traffic is becoming increasingly busy and starting to overflow as the urban population in busy cities continue to grow. 'The pollution caused by CO2 emission is making the urban atmosphere worse each time,' he says. 'In Paris, this year, government provided public transportation for free and asked people to not use their cars for three days in an attempt of battle against the intense pollution of the air. 'Also in this year, in Beijing, giant LCD panels were used to show a virtual sunset to pedestrians, while the city was evolved in a very dense and polluted atmosphere hiding the natural horizon.' Look familiar? The concept of a flying personal vehicle with a spherical roof was popularised by the cartoon The Jetsons, which had some rather fantastical visions of the future on Earth . The Fly Citycopter is essentially a personal helicopter designed to transport us around cities in a much more efficient and eco-friendly way than relying on driving or waiting for a bus . Galvani said for now, he hopes that this concept will inspire creative people working within the transportation industry to consider developing alternative means of eco-friendly travel in crowded places . The inventor points out how cities across the world, including London, experienced terrible fog and pollution in April this year. Dimensions: 20.8 x 17.1 x 18 feet (6.34 x 5.20 x 5.49 metres) Weight: 2,450 pounds (1,110 kilograms) Max Altitude: 12,000 feet (3,600 metres) Max Speed: 120 miles (190 kilometres) per hour . Range: 300 miles (480 kilometres) Baggage loading: 210 pounds (95 kilograms) Ready to fly in 1 minute . However he believes that we are experiencing a 'strong wave of green energy', representing a human effort to challenge global warming. And he claims that his personal helicopters could be part of this green revolution, providing people with greener and easier ways of getting to work. Using fans and electric engines, the portable vehicles would limit the creation of pollutants. By simply blowing air, Galvani hopes they would help to alleviate the waste chemicals that are leaked by cars in urban centres at the moment. The vehicle would be powered by electricity and recharged by the sun using solar cells. It would be similar in flight and handling to a helicopter, albeit cheaper, easier to control, quieter and smoother thanks to its multiple fans according to Galvani. While it can be controlled manually, it can also apparently go into autopilot mode for take-off, flight and landing. It would be made from carbon, aluminium and titanium, with its side coated in solar cells. However, he isn't in the process of building the vehicle at the moment. For now, he says the concept is 'just to inspire creative people from the industry of transportation about another possible way to make a new reality come true'. 'The pollution caused by CO2 emission is making the urban atmosphere worse each time,' says Galvani. 'In Paris, this year, government provided public transportation for free and asked people to not use their cars for three days in an attempt of battle against the intense pollution of the air'","Designer Eduardo Galvani has unveiled his concept for air vehicles .

Six months on, a year long deep sea search for the Malaysian airlines plane, missing in the Indian Ocean, will commence in September. The southern part of the search zone will be prioritised looking for MH370 and will see towed vehicles equipped with sonar . and video cameras, dragged along the sea floor, off the coast of Perth. In Canberra, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss met with his Malaysian and Chinese counterparts and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered. Scroll down for video .

Crew aboard the Australian defence vessel, Ocean Shield, as they look for the missing Malaysian airlines plane MH370. A year long search will commence in September . Mr Truss said analysis of the airline's failed satellite phone call attempt to Flight MH370 suggests the plane might have turned south earlier than previously expected. 'A failed satellite telephone conversation was attempted between Malaysia Airlines on the ground and the aircraft, and . that has suggested to us that the aircraft may have turned south a little earlier than we had previously expected,' Buzzfeed reported Mr Truss saying. In Canberra, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (pictured left) met with his Malaysian (middle) and Chinese counterparts (right) and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered. The 1.1 million square kilometres search zone remains the same size but authorities have been able to make refinements with satellite data. 'The (data) expanded our knowledge of the area, indicating depths up to 1500 metres deeper than previously known, and . the identification of two underwater volcanos,' said Mr Truss. The expensive $52 million pricetag will be split between Australia and Malaysia. 'We have so far committed and spent about $15 million (AUD) and we are also going to match the Australians in the . tender cost for this search for MH370. We need to find the plane, we need to find the black box to come to a conclusion,' said Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai. MH370 Underwater search areas planning map. A year long deep sea search for the missing Malaysian airlines plane will commence in September . Buzzfeed reported that Australia had budgeted up to $90 million over the next two years to find the plane but there's question over whether . it would be extended over that period. 'Malaysia’s pledge continued and unwavering support in response to the unprecedented nature and scale of this event  through our financial commitment, technical expertise, equipment, and stamina in our search for answers,' said Mr Truss. But It's a race against time. More than 200 people have been employed by Dutch surveying group Fugro to get the job done as quickly as possible. They have a one-year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, before they will be forced to move on by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). Fugro must follow the lead provided by the ATSB. Forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months. ‘We know the time frame we have is about a year, after that we’ll be working in a new box as provided by the ATSB – they’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it (the plane wreckage) may be further south or north, they can order us to move at any time,' said Fugro Managing Director, Steve Duffield. ‘There’s certainly no time to waste.' Scroll down for video . On board with the Fugro Equator as crews prepare surveying equipment for the next stage of the search for MH370 . ‘We’ve got one year to search inside our designated box, if you like, before moving on.' The images (below) of the search process which have been provided to Daily Mail Australia by Fugro, give a sense of what the Dutch team is up against. The Fugro, which is 65 metres long, is highlighted by the small circle, dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern Indian Ocean. It has just returned to the area after a crew change. In a setback for the operation, Mr Duffield said the sister ship, Furgo Discovery, has had to be diverted via West Africa and away from the Suez Canal 'because we were worried about pirates, even though we went through the process of hardening the boat'. That included placing barbed wire right about Discovery to try and prevent any potential hijacking. It should arrive in mid-September, about 10 days later than expected. 'I’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success,' Mr Duffield said. Surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea-bed ahead of sensors being sent down. In some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down. Using its advanced survey vessel, the Fugro Equator, fitted with state-of-the art multibeam echosounder equipment, Fugro is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area. The seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off Western Australia. Fugro will spend more than $52 million in the next year in the search for MH370. 200 personnel will work on the project and are 'finding equipment from factories all around the world' Mapping work continues in the area designated by the ATSB, as Fugro try to make the most of every possible minute. ‘They (the ATSB) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate,’ he said. That ‘box’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean, an area approximately the size of Tasmania, 1600 kilometres off the West Australian coast. ‘We are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches,’ Mr Duffield said. Optimistically, he added that ‘we expect to see a debris field’. ‘We are also expecting, in a worst-case scenario, that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object. Inside the control room on board the Fugro Equator where teams will monitor the progress of search equipment scouring the sea bed of the southern Indian Ocean for debris from MH370 . The Equator with a new crew on board is now on its way out to the southern Indian Ocean for a third mission searching for the wreckage of MH370. Fugro has 200 people working on the project, around the world . ‘We’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn, so to speak. That's when we tow our sensors along the bottom. 'That's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the Blue Fins were unsuccessful - it's very deep water we're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places. ‘But our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date, is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea-bed. ‘I’m not really sure how this will search will end up, it’s a massive area about the size of Tasmania and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task.’ The search conducted by the Dutch firm Fugro will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre stretch of the Indian Ocean off the WA coast .

MH370 went missing on March 8 on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, including six . Australians and 153 Chinese nationals. Initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following its disappearance indicated it most likely crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,500km south-west of Perth. But despite an international search effort led by Australia and operated out of the Pearce Air Force base in Perth, no debris from the plane has been found. Troubled carrier Malaysia Airlines is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17 . The first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas, conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships, which concluded on April 28. An acoustic search, accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted, also without success. The ocean floor search was completed on May 28. As part of a major restructure, the Malaysian Government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private. Significant job losses are expected. The overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of MH370 and MH17. Mr Truss and Mr Lai also discussed ongoing recovery efforts for MH17 - the Malaysia Airlines jet downed by a missile . strike over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing 298 people, including 38 Australians.","A year long deep sea search for MH370 to start in September .

"By . Associated Press . A Connecticut man fatally shot himself in the head during a game of Russian roulette that was seen by a friend during a video chat. Armand Cyr, 38, was at another friend's apartment in Vernon, about 13 miles east of Hartford, when he put a .38-caliber revolver to his head and pulled the trigger on the evening of July 13, court records revealed this week show. Cyr, who had a young daughter, shot himself after being handed the gun by the other friend, John Dybowski, 26, who had put the gun to his own head and pulled the trigger without a bullet discharging, police said. Dybowski was arrested last week after police said they found guns and drugs in his apartment. Tragic: Armand Cyr (right), 38, died in July while playing Russian roulette with John Dybowski (left), 26. A third friend, who was chatting with them online, watched in horror as Cyr shot himself . Authorities said the fatal game was seen by an unidentified friend from East Hartford who was having an online video chat with the two men. Dybowski told police he gave Cyr an unloaded revolver and a single bullet, but said he was in another room when Cyr shot himself, according to the affidavit. The friend at the other end of the video chat said he saw Dybowski put the revolver to his head and pull the trigger, then told Dybowski and Cyr that what they were doing was ""crazy,"" the affidavit says. The friend then saw Cyr shoot himself and slump back lifeless on a couch. He initially thought it was a joke. Police said they found two more guns as well as marijuana, heroin, pills and cocaine residue in Dybowski's apartment, resulting in his arrest. Authorities said they also found photos on Cyr's cellphone of him and Dybowski with drugs and guns shortly before the incident.

"By . John Hall for MailOnline . This is the moment a young elephant was sent flying after unwisely attempting to intimidate a huge buffalo bull. The over-confident calf was among a herd of elephants refreshing themselves at the Spekboom lagoon in Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa when the mature buffalo walked towards the water to join them. While the adult elephants seemingly paid little attention to their new drinking partner, the calf was clearly put out by his presence - charging towards him in the bizarre hope that his tiny frame would somehow scare the massive buffalo into leaving the area. Needless to say, the bull  wasn't intimidated in the slightest and casually waited until the young elephant was within striking range before shoving him with his huge horned head. The poor calf was thrown several feet into the air before crashing back down on to the South African savanna. The whole sorry incident, which took place in March this year, was caught on camera by local wildlife guide Conrad Cramer. Mr Cramer said that although the calf's pride was undoubtedly hurt, he escaped physical injury and spent the rest of the day hiding behind his mother. 'What surprised me was that the other elephants were in no way disturbed by the chain of events, but rather seemed to see it as a life lesson that the youngster had to learn,' Mr Cramer said. Scroll down for video . Taking a tumble: After making the unwise decision to challenge a mature buffalo more than twice his size, the self-assured elephant calf was sent flying several feet into the air by a single shove of the larger animal's massive head . Over-confident: The calf was clearly put out by the presence of the mature buffalo at the watering hole and decided to charge towards him in the bizarre hope that his tiny frame would somehow scare the huge bull into leaving the area .

Brace: While the adult elephants seemingly paid little attention to their new drinking partner, the calf decided it would be a good idea to try and intimidate the massive bull . Crunch: The bull wasn't intimidated at all and casually waited until the young elephant was within striking range before using his massive head to shove him away . Going down: The calf is likely to have had second thoughts as he closed down on the buffalo, but by that point it was too late. As the unlikely enemies came together, the young elephant's body twisted in a painful-looking way before he wound up in an embarrassing pile on the grass . Ouch: The young elephant ends up in a heap on the floor after his unwise decision to start a fight with a mature buffalo more than twice his size. The whole sorry incident, which took place in March this year, was caught on camera by local wildlife guide Conrad Cramer . Lucky:  Wildlife guide Conrad Cramer said that although the calf's pride was undoubtedly hurt, his thick skull and sturdy body ensured he escaped serious physical injury . Aftermath: The bull buffalo continued to hang around in the area after the distinctly one-sided fight, completely unfazed by the presence of the young calf's herd. For their part the elephants also showed little interest in the dispute - almost as if they had shrugged off the calf's unwise attempt at intimidation as a valuable life lesson .","Over-confident elephant calf was flung up into the air after challenging a mature bull buffalo to a fight .

Donna Tithecott, 54, from Lifton in Devon failed to tell the authorities she part-owned three properties in Spain whilst claiming for housing benefit, council tax and income support. And it is expected her debts will take ‘130 years to repay’ after she was set a payment rate of £2.50 a week to the Department of Work and Pensions and £5 a week to Torridge Council. She was found guilty of all seven charges of failing to notify changes in her circumstances and dishonest representation when she appeared at Exeter Crown Court today. Despite that Judge Graham Cottle told her she would not have to serve an immediate prison sentence. The court heard that the properties were bought by her ex-husband –who she never lived with - using money he had borrowed from her. Defence lawyer Paul Grumbar said that Tithecott did not benefit from these deals and did not put any money in or take anything out of them. However her name was on the deeds for ‘a rather ordinary house’ and two barns in Spain. He agreed with the judge that it was ‘an odd case’ and said benefit fraud is normally committed by people who ‘want to enrich themselves, have a bit of luxury and a nestegg’ but Tithecott, who lives in Broadwoodwidger, Torridge, was not in these categories. Judge Cottle said she had been married for ‘only five minutes’ and her husband had worked and lived abroad almost all the time’. Speaking of the Spanish property he said: ‘You paid nothing towards it and took nothing from it.’ He was told she was in ‘very poor health’ and had just £40 a month to live on and her financial state was ‘dire’. He jailed her for nine months, suspended for two years saying it was a ‘very odd and unusual case’. The court heard the Spanish house was bought in 2004 for almost £36,000 or 45,500 euros and in 2012 was worth £94,500 (111,000 euros). The two barns were derelict and of nominal value. However the judge said to confiscate money from Spain would be complicated.

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Peter Williamson admitted assaulting taxi driver with his walking stick after fearing he was late for opera . An opera lover beat up a taxi driver with his walking stick because he thought he was going to ‘miss a performance of Puccini’. Peter Williamson, 69, flagged down a cab while he was on his way to see the open air opera in Holland Park, west London and told the driver he would need to stop for cash. A court heard the retired doctor became irate with driver Kevin Johnson, fearing he was late and shouted: ‘Where are we you f*****g c***’. Mr Johnson stopped his taxi at a cash point on Kensington High Street and watched as Williamson walked past the machine. He climbed out the car to point him in the right direction but Williamson raised his stick above his head and struck him with the handle – leaving the driver bleeding and needing stitches. Physicist Williamson, who is a fellow with the Royal Institution, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court today. Prosecutor Helen Clutton said Williamson was picked up in Wimbledon on June 17 after he flagged down a taxi in the street as he wanted to go and see a performance of Puccini’s lesser known works ‘The Girl of the Golden West.’ But he had become infuriated by the time they had reached Warwick Road near Earls Court. ‘He shouted at the victim ‘where are we you f*****g c***’ and demanded ‘Where are you f*****g taking me’, said Ms Clutton. ‘The victim could not understand why Dr Williamson was getting so irate and wanted to get him out of the taxi as soon as possible. ‘They got to Kensington High Street where the victim pulled over and stopped by Sainsbury’s which is directly opposite a cash machine. ‘There is only one machine, he walked towards the machine and there was man there already using the machine. ‘Dr Williamson did not make any effort to join the queue behind the man.’ Mr Johnson climbed out of the taxi as Williamson walked past the man using the cashpoint, the court heard. ‘Mr Johnson got out of the taxi and showed Mr Williamson where it was, he said: “Look, you have just gone past it, it is over there”,’ said Ms Clutton. ‘They got almost parallel with the cashpoint machine and the victim turned around to check Dr Williamson was coming with him. ‘Dr Williamson lifted his walking stick straight over his right shoulder and struck his victim over the head,’ she said. ‘It was similar to a hammer hitting a nail,’ said Ms Clutton. Williamson admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court (above) today . Williamson is said to have struck him twice with the ornate heavy handle of his walking stick in the ‘repeated assault’. ‘Mr Johnson reached up to touch his head with his right hand and when he brought his hand down it was covered in blood.’ The driver sustained a two inch wound and had two stitches after the unprovoked attack. District Judge Denis Brennan noted the defendant’s good character but said he was still ‘at risk of a custodial sentence’. The hearing was adjourned for a pre-sentence report to be prepared and Williamson, from Wimbledon, is due to face a sentencing hearing at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court on September 18.

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . An author who wrote her own Fifty Shades of Grey-style novel has accused a council of being 'judgemental prudes' after she lost her job at a children's centre over her erotic fiction. Bettina Bunte, 51, said her book 'The Lost Soul' was loosely based on her affair with a married middle-aged man when she was a teenager. She has been promoting the novel in the local press but after complaints from parents about some sexually explicit passages  Kent County Council had her sacked. Ms Bunte's inspiration for the book came from her 15-year romance  classroom technician when she was 18. In shock: Erotic fiction writer Bettina Bunte has lost her job in a children's centre on the Kent coast over her Fifty Shades of Grey-style book . She later fell pregnant with her daughter but when he refused to leave his wife for her their relationship ended. She wrote under the pseudonym Cass E Ritter and published the book herself - but her detailed of descriptions of sex have caused upset and she was forced from her post at Joy Lane Children's Centre in Whitstable on the Kent coast. 'I told the council they were judgemental prudes,' she said. 'I doubt the people who decided to sack me have read Fifty Shades of Grey, let alone my book. The Lost Soul is described as 'a journey to remember' for main character Nina who discovers 'lasting friendship, forbidden love and sizzling passion' with 'a man who cannot be hers' 'They obviously just see it as pornography, but it is not - it is just explicit sexual descriptions of what adults think about and do every day. 'The council told be that it could not be seen to be promoting ""this sort of thing"" and that was the end of it - I'd lost my job.' The Lost Soul is described as 'a journey to remember' for main character Nina who discovers 'lasting friendship, forbidden love and sizzling passion' with 'a man who cannot be hers'. It is being sold on Amazon in its erotica section. Ms Bunte had recently been offered a permanent position to join the centre after four years working for an agency and said she was shocked at losing her job. She said: 'They called me during work in the morning to attend a meeting in the afternoon. 'I asked what it was about but all they said was it is something about the book. 'We discussed it at the meeting where they asked me a number of questions. I was told KCC cannot be seen to promote this sort of thing. 'They felt it was a problem as it had damaged the reputation by making the link between the book and children's centre. 'I had applied and was offered a permanent position which was then withdrawn and my employment was terminated. 'I was shocked, extremely shocked. I tried not to say anything rude. I felt their reaction was out of proportion and judgmental.' Kent County Council said they took action after concerns were raised by staff and parents after the novel's release. On the attack: Ms Bunte, who is writing a sequel, says that Kent County Council are 'judgemental prudes' A spokeswoman said: 'Ms Bunte was employed through an agency to work at one of our children's centres. 'Following the publicity around her self-published novel and the issues discussed in the article, concerns were raised by staff and parents. 'Managers met with Ms Bunte to discuss these issues and, following this meeting, continued to have concerns about her suitability to continue working at the centre. 'It was felt that the most appropriate action was to stop her employment as agency cover. She will no longer be working for us.' German-born Bettina said she took legal advice in the hope of challenging her dismissal but is unable to as she works for an agency as opposed to a company. She added: 'They did what they did because they can. I was working in a very good team with a supportive manager but I have no comeback against them.' Bettina, who grew up in Munich before moving to a school in Kent, said the illicit romance helped her through her troubled teens when she was estranged from her family. She said: 'I was a loner at school. He took the trouble to be kind and we became friends. It was a safe place for me to go with no fighting or strife. 'This friendship helped me to build my own new life without my family - a life where I was worth something and didn't feel constantly criticised.'","Bettina Bunte, 51, said Kent County Council are all 'judgemental prudes'

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . A two-star U.S. Army general who failed to investigate claims of sexual assault against a colonel on his staff has been stripped of his rank and forced to retire. The Army has announced that Major General Michael T. Harrison will be retired as a brigadier general after being suspended from his duties as commander of U.S. forces in Japan. Under federal law, commissioned officers retire at the highest rank in which they are determined to have served satisfactorily. Major General Michael T Harrison, who has been stripped of his rank and forced to retire after failing to investigate claims of sexual assault against a colonel on his staff . But after a decision by Army Secretary John M. McHugh, a brief statement was released confirming that his highest grade of satisfactory service was a brigadier general. An inspector general's investigation . report released in April said that in March 2013 a Japanese woman . accused the unidentified colonel on Harrison's staff, who he had known . for 20 years, of sexually assaulting her. But Harrison waited months to report it to criminal investigators, which was deemed a violation of Army rules. In the report it was also said that he failed to treat the alleged victim with dignity and fairness and failed to remove the colonel from his position despite a pattern of allegations, according to Stars and Stripes. But despite his subsequent suspension, the Army brought him to the Pentagon to make him director of programme analysis and evaluation for an Army deputy chief of staff. Senior Pentagon officials, including Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, pictured, have been trying to make commanders more accountable . The Washington Post reported in April that he received an administrative letter of reprimand in December 2013 for mishandling the sexual-assault case and other complaints in Japan, but remained on active duty. His case has been cited as evidence of why sex-crime victims say they don't trust the military to protect them, despite efforts by senior Pentagon officials, including Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, to make commanders accountable. In March the Pentagon turned back an effort in Congress to strip commanders of the authority to prosecute cases, especially those related to sexual assault, and hand the job to seasoned military lawyers. Harrison joined the Army in 1980 and served in numerous capacities around the world. He is due to retire next month but stands to lose a substantial amount of retirement pay.

Cooler, ice box, cool box: Whatever you call it, this mainstay of picnics around the globe has barely been innovated upon for several decades. Not any more, though - Oregon-based Ryan Grepper has unveiled his innovative ‘Coolest’ device that has a host of different features, and it's currently taking the internet by storm. The cooler has become the highest funded project ever on Kickstarter, raising more than $11m . Scroll down for Video . An Oregon-based inventor has designed a new type of food and drink cooler. Known as 'Coolest' (pictured) the product has racked up £1.2 million ($2 million) on Kickstarter in just a few days. The multi-functional product has a number of different features on offer . - 18v battery-powered rechargeable blender . - Removable waterproof Bluetooth speaker . - USB charger . - LED lid light . - Gear tie-down . - Cooler divider/cutting board . - Extra wide easy rolling tyres . - Integrated storage for plates and knife . - Bottle opener . The Kickstarter campaign still has two days to run. 'On August 26, 2014, at around 10:00 PM EST, after 862 days, the Coolest Cooler took over Pebble's spot as the most funded project in Kickstarter history,' said Yancey Strickler, the founder of Kickstarter. Combining Bluetooth functionality, a smartly designed interior, off-road wheels, a blender and more, Grepper is hoping that his innovation is going to change the world of coolers forever. The device can be bought by residents of the U.S. now for £96 ($165), while customers in the EU and Canada can get one for £108 ($185). The release date is expected by February 2015, although higher pledges get access to earlier releases - and for £1,200 ($2,000) the inventor himself will attend a party you host. From the outside the Coolest is similar in shape and size to a regular cooler. On its top though is a blender, which can be used with a supplied jug to mix up drinks and food. A single charge of the device, via the mains, will apparently allow for 27 litres (six gallons) of liquid to be blended. Wireless speakers are also included on the exterior, which can be connected to by a Bluetooth-enabled device. These are also waterproof, preventing them becoming damaged from spillages or the rain. Other features of the multi-purpose cooler include a USB charger, LED lights inside to light up when it’s dark and a tie-down to hold equipment on top. Beach-ready tyres make it easy to drag over rough terrain, while an interior divider can keep surplus ice separate. The final feature of the jack-of-all-trades device is a bottle opener on its exterior. The Pebble Watch, a smartwatch developed by Pebble Technology.

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . and Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . New details about repeated calls made to Malaysian airliner MH370 shortly after it disappeared from radar suggest the missing plane turned south earlier than previously thought and may alter the planned search area. A year long deep sea search of the Indian Ocean is set commence in September, six months after the plane first went missing. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the search area could be extended farther south based on analysis of the calls airline officials made to plane from the ground. Scroll down for video . In Canberra, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (pictured right) met with his Malaysian (pictured left) and Chinese counterparts and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered with a one year deep sea search to begin in September . Crew aboard the Australian defence vessel, Ocean Shield, as they look for the missing Malaysian airlines plane MH370. A year long search will commence in September . Investigators have only recently worked out a way to analyse the call data despite having access to it for months, Associated Press reported. Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Martin Dolan said he would meet with international experts next week to decide whether the 60,000 square kilometre (23,000 square mile) targeted search area should be extended or shifted further south based on the new analysis. 'We think we may extend that area farther south; that's the thing we're currently considering,' he said . The new analysis applies to satellite data from the first of two satellite phone calls Malaysia Airlines ground staff attempted to make to Flight 370's crew. In Canberra, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (pictured left) met with his Malaysian (middle) and Chinese counterparts (right) and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered. By the time the calls were attempted, the plane had become invisible to civilian radar. It had flown west without communications past Sumatra and beyond the range of Malaysian military radar. Mr Dolan said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar. 'Previously, there was the possibility that it could have been quite a bit later, so we had to do our modelling based on a range of possibilities as to where the aircraft turned,' he said. 'We're now more confident that it turned comparatively early. That does make a difference to how we prioritise the search along the seventh arc,' he added, referring to the area where satellite information from a jet engine transmitter suggests the plane ran out of fuel and crashed. The southern part of the search zone will be prioritised looking for MH370 and will see towed vehicles equipped with sonar . and video cameras, dragged along the sea floor, off the coast of Perth. In Canberra, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss met with his Malaysian and Chinese counterparts and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered. The 1.1 million square kilometres search zone remains the same size but authorities have been able to make refinements with satellite data. MH370 Underwater search areas planning map. A year long deep sea search for the missing Malaysian airlines plane will commence in September . 'The (data) expanded our knowledge of the area, indicating depths up to 1500 metres deeper than previously known, and . the identification of two underwater volcanos,' said Mr Truss. The expensive $52 million pricetag will be split between Australia and Malaysia. 'We have so far committed and spent about $15 million (AUD) and we are also going to match the Australians in the . tender cost for this search for MH370. We need to find the plane, we need to find the black box to come to a conclusion,' said Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai. Buzzfeed reported that Australia had budgeted up to $90 million over the next two years to find the plane but there's question over whether . it would be extended over that period. 'Malaysia’s pledge continued and unwavering support in response to the unprecedented nature and scale of this event  through our financial commitment, technical expertise, equipment, and stamina in our search for answers,' said Mr Truss. But It's a race against time. More than 200 people have been employed by Dutch surveying group Fugro to get the job done as quickly as possible. They have a one-year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, before they will be forced to move on by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). On board with the Fugro Equator as crews prepare surveying equipment for the next stage of the search for MH370 . Fugro must follow the lead provided by the ATSB. Forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months. ‘We know the time frame we have is about a year, after that we’ll be working in a new box as provided by the ATSB – they’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it (the plane wreckage) may be further south or north, they can order us to move at any time,' said Fugro Managing Director, Steve Duffield. ‘There’s certainly no time to waste.' ‘We’ve got one year to search inside our designated box, if you like, before moving on.' The images (below) of the search process which have been provided to Daily Mail Australia by Fugro, give a sense of what the Dutch team is up against. The Fugro, which is 65 metres long, is highlighted by the small circle, dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern Indian Ocean. It has just returned to the area after a crew change. In a setback for the operation, Mr Duffield said the sister ship, Furgo Discovery, has had to be diverted via West Africa and away from the Suez Canal 'because we were worried about pirates, even though we went through the process of hardening the boat'. That included placing barbed wire right about Discovery to try and prevent any potential hijacking. It should arrive in mid-September, about 10 days later than expected. 'I’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success,' Mr Duffield said. Surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea-bed ahead of sensors being sent down. In some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down. Using its advanced survey vessel, the Fugro Equator, fitted with state-of-the art multibeam echosounder equipment, Fugro is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area. The seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off Western Australia. Fugro will spend more than $52 million in the next year in the search for MH370. 200 personnel will work on the project and are 'finding equipment from factories all around the world' Mapping work continues in the area designated by the ATSB, as Fugro try to make the most of every possible minute. ‘They (the ATSB) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate,’ he said. That ‘box’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean, an area approximately the size of Tasmania, 1600 kilometres off the West Australian coast. ‘We are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches,’ Mr Duffield said. Optimistically, he added that ‘we expect to see a debris field’. ‘We are also expecting, in a worst-case scenario, that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object. Inside the control room on board the Fugro Equator where teams will monitor the progress of search equipment scouring the sea bed of the southern Indian Ocean for debris from MH370 . The Equator with a new crew on board is now on its way out to the southern Indian Ocean for a third mission searching for the wreckage of MH370. Fugro has 200 people working on the project, around the world . ‘We’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn, so to speak. That's when we tow our sensors along the bottom. 'That's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the Blue Fins were unsuccessful - it's very deep water we're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places. ‘But our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date, is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea-bed. ‘I’m not really sure how this will search will end up, it’s a massive area about the size of Tasmania and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task.’ The search conducted by the Dutch firm Fugro will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre stretch of the Indian Ocean off the WA coast .

MH370 went missing on March 8 on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, including six . Australians and 153 Chinese nationals. Initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following its disappearance indicated it most likely crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,500km south-west of Perth. But despite an international search effort led by Australia and operated out of the Pearce Air Force base in Perth, no debris from the plane has been found. Troubled carrier Malaysia Airlines is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17 . The first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas, conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships, which concluded on April 28. An acoustic search, accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted, also without success. The ocean floor search was completed on May 28. As part of a major restructure, the Malaysian Government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private. Significant job losses are expected. The overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of MH370 and MH17. Mr Truss and Mr Lai also discussed ongoing recovery efforts for MH17 - the Malaysia Airlines jet downed by a missile . strike over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing 298 people, including 38 Australians.","A year long deep sea search for MH370 to start in September .

His claims are made in his new book called Diana: That Night in which he reveals his shock at the standard of the security operation around her and boyfriend Dodi Fayed. An inquest in 2008 heard how an ill-fated plan was devised for off-duty security manager Henri Paul, who had been drinking, to drive the pair away from their hotel in a bid to avoid the paparazzi. Scroll down for video . 'DIY': A picture taken moments before the crash that killed Diana shows the driver Henri Paul (right), bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones (left) with the Princess and her boyfriend Dodi Fayed in the back seat. A former French police officer claims the tragedy happened in part because she had an inadequate security detail that night . CCTV footage shows off-duty security manager Henri Paul arriving at the Ritz hotel in Paris on the night she died. An inquest heard an ill-fated plan was devised to evade paparazzi that night by getting Mr Paul to drive the couple from the back of the hotel while Dodi's usual driver, Philippe Dorneau, remained at the front as a decoy . The hearing ruled they were unlawfully killed due to Mr Paul's 'gross negligence' after the car crashed in a Paris tunnel while being pursued by photographers. In an interview with French newspaper Le Parisien, which has been translated by The Local, Mr Bourdon said: 'My book is not a counter-investigation. 'It reproduces things as they were. Only, according to me, the princess did not have a level of security and protection that an icon like her deserved. 'It was DIY and that allowed a chain of circumstances that had a tragic outcome.' Diana, 36, Fayed, 42, and Mr Paul, 41, were killed in the crash on August 31, 1997, while the Princess's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was seriously injured. 'Icon': Former French police officer Daniel Bourdon says he was shocked at the security operation around Diana and Dodi. His new book claims it was a factor in the chain of events that led up to the Princess's death . The inquest heard how a plan was hatched for Mr Paul to drive the couple from the back of the hotel while Dodi's usual driver, Philippe Dorneau, remained at the front as a decoy. Mr Paul decided to drive the car to Dodi's father Mohamed Al-Fayed's apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye in the early hours of the morning. Mr Paul was reminded moments before setting off that it was not his job to drive the couple but said nothing, the hearing was told. Ritz night security manager Francois Tendil said he had seen no sign that his boss Mr Paul had been drinking that night, although blood tests after the crash showed he was over the drink-drive limit. Mr Bourdon said he was given the task of guarding Diana's body in the morgue at the Salpetriere hospital and spoke to her as he stood there for 15 minutes. 'It was a poignant moment. Her face was magnificent,' he said.","Daniel Bourdon reveals shock at security operation for Diana in new book .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A minibus driver was jailed for five years this afternoon for killing a cyclist while looking at photographs on his mobile phone. Andrzej Wojcicki, 45, was stopped at traffic lights when he took a snap of a vintage sports car which pulled up alongside him. Wojcicki collided with cyclist Owain James, 30, while looking at the photograph he had taken as he pulled away and hit speeds of 50mph. Andrzej Wojcicki, left, was looking at photos on his phone while driving when he killed Owain James, right . Polish born Wojcicki admitted looking at the photo behind the wheel of his three-ton left-hand drive Mercedes minibus but told a court it 'didn't impact' on his driving. Prosecutor Nicholas Jones said: 'The driver never saw the cyclist because he was distracted until after he collided with him. 'Wojcicki was driving dangerously - you do not take pictures while you are driving along and then look at them.' Wojcicki tried to blame Mr James for the accident for swerving in front of him and for not wearing a helmet while cycling his bicycle . Wojcicki was on his way back from a Jehovah's Witness conference with his wife and children when he hit Mr James on the A472 near Newbridge, South Wales. Cardiff Crown Court heard Wojcicki got out of his minibus after the crash and began taking pictures of his victim lying in the road. Wojcicki blamed Mr James, who was not wearing a helmet, for swerving out in front of his silver minibus. The accident happened around 8pm on July 21, 2013. A jury took just seven hours to find him guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. Judge David Wyn Morgan told him: 'You were paying little if any attention to the road in front of you. 'The visibilty was excellent and the traffic was minimal - if you had been looking you couldn't have failed to be aware of the cyclist. 'The distraction which caused this was your use of the mobile telephone for taking pictures of cars. 'The use of a mobile telephone to examine images while driving is every bit as dangerous as texting. 'You were driving a three-ton minibus - Mr James didn't stand a chance.' Wojcicki, of Blackwood, Caerphilly, was banned from driving for 10 years. The accident happened on the A472 near Newbridge in South Wales, pictured, on July 21, 2013 at around 8pm .","Andrzej Wojcicki was travelling at 50mph when he struck Owain Jones .

"By . Tamara Cohen . He once said he had as much chance of becoming Prime Minister as being decapitated by a frisbee or being reincarnated as an olive. But Boris Johnson now appears to regard the top job as not quite such a remote prospect after all. In typically flamboyant style, he declared: ‘If the ball came loose from the back of a scrum, it would be a great thing to have a crack at.’ The sporting analogy marked a change of tone from previous interviews in which he slapped down questions about coveting the top job. 'How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck on a zip wire?' Mr Johnson has been dismissive of questions about his leadership ambitions in the past . Quite apart from his remarks about olives and frisbees, after he was photographed dangling from a zip wire in an Olympics publicity stunt last summer, he said: ‘How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck on a zip wire?’ But some months on, with David Cameron plagued by rumours of leadership plots, Mr Johnson took a more serious tone. He said: ‘I think it’s a very tough job being prime minister. ‘Obviously, if the ball came loose from the back of a scrum – which it won’t – it would be a great, great thing to have a crack at. But it’s not going to happen.’ How little he's changed: The infant Boris (left) in a picture from his family album used in the BBC2 documentary.

Other MPs . closer to London have also been rumoured to be prepared to step aside. Mr Johnson was speaking in a documentary by Michael Cockerell who has profiled Margaret Thatcher, Ted Heath, Alan Clark, Barbara Castle and Mr Cameron. What Mr Johnson says to the documentary maker is quoted in an article by Mr Cockerell in this week’s Radio Times. His sister, columnist Rachel Johnson, tells how as a child Boris told people he wanted to be ‘World King’. His mother – the painter Charlotte Johnson Wahl, who divorced Boris’s father, former MP Stanley, when he was a child – said she thought it was ‘a wish to make himself unhurtable, invincible, and somehow safe from the… pain of your parents splitting up’. Mr Johnson also spoke of his ‘self-loathing’ at the raucous antics of the Bullingdon Club drinking society of which he and Mr Cameron were members at Oxford. As ever, he shrugged off questions about his private life, claiming the public were ‘little interested in that side of things’. Boris Johnson: The Irresistible Rise is due to be shown on BBC2 at 9pm on March 25.","Boris Johnson admits he'd grab the chance to become leader .

"By . John Hall For Mailonline . Chelsea Manning is not receiving hormone therapy treatment for her gender identity condition, despite it being approved by U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. The American Civil Liberties Union and Manning's attorney contacted defence department officials, including Hagel, to notify them that a lawsuit will be filed if treatment is not confirmed by September 4. The former intelligence analyst is currently serving a 35-year sentence at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth for leaking classified documents to the WikiLeaks website. Manning, who changed her name from Bradley after her conviction, has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria - the sense of being a woman in a man's body. Denied treatment: Chelsea Manning is currently serving a 35-year sentence at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth for leaking classified documents to the WikiLeaks website . Manning first sought evaluation and treatment for her gender condition after she was sent to the Fort Leavenworth prison in September 2013. She is asking for hormone therapy and to be able to live as a woman. Military doctors confirmed the gender dysphoria diagnosis and recommended a treatment plan, but she has yet to receive any treatment, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. 'The continued failure to provide Ms. Manning with this treatment is inconsistent with well-established medical protocols and basic constitutional principles,' Chase Strangio, attorney for the ACLU's Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project, said in a statement. Strangio said refusing to treat Manning is 'cruel and unusual punishment' and contended the Army is withholding treatment for political reasons. Convicted: Chelsea Manning, who changed her name from Bradley after being jailed, has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria - the sense of being a woman in a man's body . The lack of treatment puts Manning at risk for serious long-term physical and psychological harm, her advocates said. Manning was sentenced last year for six Espionage Act violations and 14 other offenses after she gave WikiLeaks more than 700,000 secret military and U.S. State Department documents. Manning's request for treatment was the first ever made by a transgender military inmate. It conflicts with a policy that prohibits transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, but Manning can't be discharged from the service while serving her prison sentence.","Manning is supposed to be receiving treatment for her gender condition .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Qantas' record $2.84 billion loss didn't come as a shock for a former flight attendant who worked 12 years for the company. Once known as the high-flying luxury airline, Mr Beddall says the iconic Australian brand fails to meet its high standards. Mr Beddall, who spent his career attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant, told Daily Mail Australia why The Flying Kangaroo is spiralling downhill and will continue to do so until the Australian government addresses 'the white elephant in the room'. Scroll down for video . Owen Beddall, a former flight attendant, wasn't surprised when Qantas announced its $2.84 billion loss . Mr Beddall met Russell Brand (left) and Katy Perry (right) during his time as a first-class flight attendant for Qantas . The little luxuries are missing . Mr Beddall says Qantas used to pride itself in being a luxury brand with 'the whole package'. 'When I started, we gave our amenity packs which had ear plugs, pajamas, face mist sprays, face masks, expensive moisturisers,' he said. 'The economy class got a little kit too and there was even something for the children.' Mr Beddall, who maintains contact with his former colleagues who currently work for the airline, says passengers have to specifically ask for such services which puts them in 'an awkward position'. This is one of the reasons why he believes passengers are no longer getting their value for money. 'Qantas has taken away the little intricacies and although that may not be the stand alone reason why people don't fly with them anymore, people are paying top dollar and they're not satisfied,' he said. Qantas services and staff are failing to meet the expectations of passengers . Staff morale is at an all-time low . Mr Beddall says his colleagues used to be proud of working for such a landmark Australian brand. 'They would put on their uniform with pride - just as if it was like a military uniform,' he said. 'But now they're embarrassed, fearful for their jobs and disheartened with the union.' He says there's an overall dark element surrounding staff and it's affecting passengers and their flight experience. Mr Beddell says management and the board - including Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce (pictured) - should be held responsible . Board and management are terrible … and refuse to take responsibility . And it all comes down to the board and management. Mr Beddell says both should be changed immediately with intervention from the government. 'We need to address the white elephant in the room,' he said. The government needs to intervene to help Qantas financially and also get rid of Alan Joyce [Qantas Chief Executive].' He also made mention that Qantas has 'forgotten its Australian identity'. 'Passengers felt like they were home flying with Qantas - they even got little jars of Vegemite - but that feeling of comfort isn't there anymore,' he said. 'And that's such a shame because Qantas is such a beautiful iconic Australian brand.' The running down of economy class . Mr Beddell says passengers in economy class are getting the short end of the stick if they fly with Qantas. 'With the prices that they pay, the normal passengers should be getting the same respect as business class and quite frankly they're not,' he said. 'Me as a consumer - I wouldn't pay top dollar when you're treated just the same, if not better, on other airlines for a cheaper price.' Qantas no longer has 'the whole package', Mr Beddall said . Poor service and staffing . This also includes the dwindling number of cabin crew on board Qantas flights compared to other carriers. 'There aren't enough staff on board to tend to the passengers and this is another huge factor,' Mr Beddall said. The staff are also 'disengaged' and often miss the attention to detail. 'We used to be an airline with 100 per cent customer satisfaction,' Mr Beddall said. 'Let's face it, it's not like this anymore for both passengers and staff.' So where's the airline going now? 'On a rapid downhill slide,' Mr Beddall told Daily Mail Australia. The retired Qantas flight attendant is now the author of Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley. His tell-all memoir highlights of his 12-year career for Qantas.

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . Meet devout Sikh Avtar Singh Mauni - the proud owner of the world's largest turban. The holy man says his extra large headgear weighs a hefty 100lb and measures a staggering 645m (2,115 feet) when unwrapped - the same length as 13 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The 60-year-old has been regularly adding to it for the past 16 years and it now takes him up to six hours to get it on. Scroll down for video . The Turbanator: Avtar Singh Mauni has a turban that measures an incredible 645m - so big that he is forced to travel by motorcycle as he can't fit inside a car . The 60-year-old has been regularly adding to his turban for the past 16 years and it now takes him up to six hours to get it on . Mr Mauni said: 'I don't consider it to be a burden. I'm most happy when I wear it. 'I just keep putting on the cloth from top to bottom one layer at a time just like you would lay the storeys of a building. 'On the rare times I don't have my turban on I keep getting this feeling of being incomplete, that some part of me is missing. I get afraid that I may fall and I keep wondering ""have I lost something, where is my turban?""' Tight squeeze: Mr Mauni can only just fit through normal doorways . He added: 'Until the time I have no more have strength in my limbs I will carry this turban on my head.' Most other Sikhs wear turbans that measure between five and seven metres, but Mr Mauni, from Patiala, in the Punjab, has decided to take it to a whole new level. The length of the cloth is yet to be officially verified but if proved correct it would overtake current Guinness World Record holder, Major Singh, whose turban measured 400m. To break the record, Mr Mauni says he took the length up in stages from 150m to 250m, 365m and finally a shocking 645m. He says the purple and orange cloth alone weighs 66lb but with the addition of decorative ornaments tips the scales at a whopping 100lb. Wide load: The size of Mr Mauni's turban is even more apparent when he's alongside other Sikhs . In full attire, Mr Mauni also carries a sword and heavy bangles, which weigh an additional 87lb. The height and width of his bulbous headgear makes entering doorways extremely difficult and getting into a car is impossible. So Mr Mauni rides a motorcycle on his regular pilgrimages across the Punjab. Not surprisingly he has become something of a celebrity - but the attention is not always welcome. Accessories: Mr Mauni wears bangles and decorative ornaments that push the weight of his clothing to 100lbs . Intrigue: Mr Mauni interacts with local school children while sporting his huge traditional Punjabi turban  in the Indian town of Patiala . It's a wrap: Most other Sikhs wear turbans that measure between five and seven metres . 'When I go out a huge crowd gathers around me. Some are amazed beyond belief and tell me ""you are great for carrying such a large turban. You must have been blessed with lots of energy"",' said Mr Mauni, who belongs to the prestigious warrior order of Sikhs, known as Nihangs. 'But sometimes all they want is to take a picture, so I loudly tell them to stop. After all it takes me hours to put on my turban and all they want is to take a quick picture and then run away.' However, his efforts are impressing many in the Sikh community. Gurpreet Singh, who affectionately refers to Mr Mauni as Babaji - which means grandfather - says the giant turban has helped reawaken love for their religion among younger people. He said: 'These days many Sikh children choose to cut their hair and have forgotten to wear turbans. But Babaji remind us of its importance, which is very good. 'The Sikh community can learn a lot from him and our children can learn that they should grow their hair and wear a turban.'","Devout Sikh Avtar Singh Mauni has a turban that measures 645 metres .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . It's like tearing down a child's hopes and dreams. Genevieve and Chris Montgomerie, from Mosman Park, in Perth's western suburbs, have been ordered by their local council to remove the DIY cubby house they built for their three children. The order from Mosman Park Council follows complaints that had been made by their neighbours claiming the cubby blocked their views and compromised their privacy. Mr and Mrs Montgomerie started to built the elaborate tree house in their backyard in mid 2013 and have been in a dispute with neighbours and council since October. It started out as a simple DIY project to encourage their three children Hugo, 7, Grace, 5, and Louie,2, to play outdoors rather than watch television or play video games. Scroll down for video . The Montgomerie family built a DIY cubby house and their local council wants to tear it down due to neighbours complaining that it blocks their views . The Montgomerie children love the backyard cubby house that their dad built for them . The couple did not realise that building the child's play area in their Mosman Park home only 20 minutes outside Perth needed council approval.  This was only made clear to them after the neighbours complained. 'What people are forgetting to mention is that there is a four-metre lane way between the two properties,' Mrs Montgomerie told the Today show on Thursday morning. The neighbour's property faces the back of the Montgomerie cubby and a laneway. Mr Montgomerie added a roof, railings and swings to add some safety to the kids play area. Ron Norris, Mosman Park Council Mayor told ABC News he was sympathetic to the Montgomeries, but council has an obligation to act when it received complaints. The cubby house that has caused an uproar in the neighbourhood in Manly Park, Western Australia . 'My attitude to a lot of those things is that people should be able to do what they want in their own backyards without much interference from council, unless it does have some adverse impact on surrounding properties,' he said. 'Living space for the kids outside where they can play is a good thing, but if it adversely affects the neighbours then they are entitled to an opinion as well.' 'In the beginning it was more than one complaint, but we spoke to the neighbour and while she wasn't happy at first she was so moved by the children's love of their cubby house that she came around,' Mrs Montgomerie told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's funny now that the only person complaining doesn't even have a house on the block of land behind the cubby, his house would just be overlooking a laneway not just our yard and cubby.' In the meantime, Ms Montgomerie said she is hopeful an amended plan may give the tree house a last-minute reprieve. Mr Montgomerie started out building the cubby from old wooden pallets and slowly added to the structure his kids love . The railings were added for safety but may need to be removed in order to comply with council . Council has told the family that they may approve the new plans if they remove the railings and other parts of the cubby which were added for the children's safety. On the Today show, Hugo, the oldest Montgomerie boy told Lisa Wilkinson, 'If they tore it down it would be horrible because all of my friends who come over love it and I love it.' Although the family is passionate about fighting the dispute, they do not want it to affect their relationship with their neighbours. 'We tried to do the neighbourly thing and went around to chat to all out neighbours before we knew who made the complaints, because we care so much about our neighbourhood,' said Mrs Montgomerie. 'At the end of the day if it has to come down, it has to come down. We just hope council will reconsider the amended plans,' said Mr Montgomerie. The family will find out the outcome of their retrospective proposal on Tuesday.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A mother fears her 12-year-old son could be scarred for life after a tattoo he had on a family holiday left him with horrific leg injuries. Ethan Crosland, from Rawthorpe, Huddersfield, was allowed the temporary Henna tattoo as a treat while on a family holiday to Egypt. But he was left in agony when it burst into raw blisters and left his leg red and swollen. Scroll down for video . 12-year-old Ethan Crosland was left in agony when his Henna tattoo burst into raw blisters and left his leg red . Ethan's mother, Emma Lindley, has warned others about the risks of getting tattoos on holiday . Doctors are treating Ethan with antiseptic creams and antibiotics, but cannot rule out the tattoo leaving permanent scarring. Now Ethan's mother, Emma Lindley, has warned others to beware of the risks. She said: 'There were young toddlers racing around the hotel complex who had them done and things could really go wrong for them. 'We don't know why Ethan's tattoo has developed as it has but I wouldn't want others to go through what he has done'. Ethan, a pupil at Rawthorpe High School, visited Sharm El Sheikh on August 3 for a two-week holiday with his five-year-old sister Tayler-Mae, mother and her partner, Marcus Pennington. They stayed at the four-star Aqua Blu resort, that boasts the biggest water park in the area. Ethan, pictured with his sister Tayler-Mae and mother, Emma Lindley, was allowed the tattoo as a treat in Egypt . The tattoo came up in huge blisters which were bursting when Ethan returned home from holiday in Egypt . Miss Lindley said: 'Unfortunately after a day or two, I had to take Ethan to the clinic as he had developed an ear infection. 'We think it was from swimming in the pools and the doctor advised him to stay out of the water for a few days. 'There was a salon on the complex with the henna tattoo parlour and as a treat for Ethan, I said he could have one done. 'He had it on his leg and it was fine for a few days. The tattooist said she would top it up the day we left so he went back and had it inked in again. 'But a couple of days after we got home, Ethan said his leg was really itching and we saw that the tattoo had come up in huge blisters which were bursting. 'He has been down to the doctor who has prescribed creams and more antibiotics, but we don't know if there will be any long-term damage'. Ethan has to have the dragon tattoo covered in cream to try and bring down the swelling - and thankfully, the pain has eased thanks to the medical treatment. Earlier this year, seven-year-old Liam Sayer suffered a similar fate when he woke in agony with his back covered in sores and blisters after a reaction to a huge henna tattoo he had on his back. He also had the tattoo done in Egypt during a two-week trip to the Titanic Beach Spa and Aquapark, in Hurghada, Egypt. He was told to avoid the sunshine for the remainder of the summer and doctors warned his worried mother that he may be forced to stay inside for the next two years as his body battles the horrific condition.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . and Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Twitter users normally gauge how their tweets are doing by seeing how many retweets, favourites and replies they've got to a particular post. But now with a new analytics tool they can see how their followers are engaging with their tweets in terms of popularity and views. And the tool can also break down a user's followers, showing where they are from, what interests they share and more. Twitter has rolled out an analytics tool (shown) for all of its users. The tool had previously been available only to advertisers. It lets Twitter users see how many views their tweets have hadIt also gives a breakdown of followers including gender, locations and more . People who use Facebook and Twitter are less likely than others to share their opinions on hot-button issues, even when they are offline. That's according to a survey that challenges the view of social media as a vehicle for debate. The study suggests that sites like Facebook and Twitter might actually encourage self-censorship. The study was carried out by Pew Research Centre in Washington DC in conjunction with Rutgers University in New Jersey. Researchers said they detected what they call the 'spiral of silence' phenomenon: Unless people know their audience agrees, they are likely to shy away from discussing anything controversial. In other words, most people are more comfortable with ice-bucket challenges than political banter. The tool was originally built for advertisers in June but now Twitter has opened its analytics dashboard to anyone, reports Mashable. People can use the tool kit at analytics.twitter.com to hone their impact on the social network. It lets them see how many times a tweet was seen by people, as well as how many times it was favourited and retweeted. The dashboard also reveals how many times people have clicked on the profile, and when and how users engaged with specific tweets. Clicking on a tweet will give its individual statistics.

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . Rosie Batty says she agonises over what she could have done to save her son Luke from his father and Victoria's child protection agencies must do the same. Ms Batty wept as she implored agencies such as Victoria Police and the Department of Human Services (DHS) to be open minded at the inquest into her son's tragic death. 'If I have to look at myself - and I don't have to but I do everyday, as his mother - how could I have protected him, if I have to live with that analysis then I'm sure organisations have to as well,' she said. Scroll down for video . Rosie Batty is appealing for an inquest as to what could have been done to prevent her son Luke's death . 'This is about saving children's lives. It is not about agencies or services protecting themselves from what legally they might get hauled over the coals about.' Greg Anderson, 54, was shot dead by police after he killed 11-year-old Luke during a custody visit at cricket training in the Victorian town of Tyabb in Victoria in February. Anderson had been playing with his son when he struck the boy in the head with a cricket bat and stabbed him at the Tyabb cricket oval, the only place where he was legally allowed to visit his son due to an intervention order. Rosie Batty, the mother of murdered 11-year-old boy Luke Batty, becomes emotional as she speaks to the media outside the Coroners Court in Melbourne . State Coroner Judge Ian Gray on Thursday ruled the inquest will focus on the final 18 months of Luke's life and what police and the DHS knew about the family violence threat posed by Anderson and what they did in response. The intervention orders taken out against Anderson, which initially restricted access to Luke but were later changed to allow limited access, will also be investigated. Ms Batty had requested that the inquest examine police prosecutors and their handling of bail applications made in court by Anderson. Luke Batty was killed by his father after a cricket game last year . The Victorian Coroners Court heard police initially opposed Anderson getting bail in April 2013. But they did not oppose his bail at another hearing in mid 2013. Anderson had breached an intervention order and was caught with child pornography, the court heard. But Judge Gray ruled the bail issue was not relevant, given the matters were not serious enough to have kept Anderson in jail until the time he killed Luke. Ms Batty said the child protection system was failing to protect women and their children in Victoria and called for change. Batty was attending a directions hearing for an inquest into the death of her son who was beaten to death by his father . 'Whether it's police or a child protection person, they go to work every day trying to do their best. But there are systemic failings,' she said. 'Children have very little voice and the coroner's inquest is about Luke's voice and it's about making sure Luke is heard and respected and honoured because I don't want him to have died in vain.' The court was told a report into the tragedy by the Commission for Children and Young People is unlikely to be finished in time to be considered by Judge Gray. But commissioner Bernie Geary later confirmed the report would be finished in time. The inquest will begin on October 13 to be followed by an inquest into Anderson's death.

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Spargo For Mailonline . The former child model who accused several Hollywood figures of sexually abusing him, including X-Men director Bryan Singer, can dismiss his lawsuit, but he has the option to re-file it later, a federal judge ruled Wednesday. Michael Egan III said in a previous court filing that he wanted to dismiss the lawsuit, not because it lacks merit, but because he can't find a new lawyer to represent him. Egan's last lawyer, Jeff Herman, left him when he backed out of a $100K settlement from Singer at the eleventh hour last month. Scroll down for video . Michael Egan III, who previously dropped three of the four lawsuits he filed against four Hollywood figures, is now able to dismiss his lawsuit against director Bryan Singer, but can refile it later . Singer sought to have the case dismissed with prejudice so it could not be re-filed, but his request was denied. U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway said Singer didn't prove that Egan's voluntary dismissal would damage the director's reputation, and that the money spent defending himself doesn't constitute legal prejudice. 'Any alleged damage to defendant's reputation may well be ameliorated by plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of the action,' she said. TMZ had reported last month that Singer's  settlement payment would be far less than he would spend in legal fees defending against the claims and would be viewed as a nuisance payment. In his initial suit, Egan claimed he began being sexually abused when he was 14 or 15 and moved to Los Angeles with his family to start his acting career. It was in LA that he was introduced to Hollywood powerplayer Marc Collins-Rector and his lover Chad Shackley when he was invited to a party at Collins-Rector's home. These parties allegedly 'featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys,' according to Egan, but he maintains he 'never freely' consented to the advances. It was two or three months after Collins-Rector began allegedly abusing Egan that he was introduced to Singer at one of the parties. Egan claims Singer performed oral sex on him when he was a minor, allegations Singer has denied . Former network TV executive Garth Ancier, who was named in Egan's lawsuit, is seeking punitive damages after he claims he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars defending himself against Egan's claims . Egan said he was in the pool, and nude, when Collins-Rector approached him and ordered him out to hug Singer, who allegedly grabbed his bare buttocks. He claims Singer later said he was 'sexy' and went on to masturbate the underage boy and perform oral sex on him. The director then told Egan to do the same to him, but he says he resisted. Singer has denied these allegations. Egan previously dropped three similar lawsuits against other entertainment figures, including former network TV executive Garth Ancier, who is currently seeking punitive damages after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars defending himself against Egan's claims. The lawsuits were filed under an unusual state law in Hawaii that created a window for civil cases in sex-abuse cases when the statute of limitations has passed. Singer's attorneys couldn't immediately be reached for comment. An attorney who Egan has said is advising him, but is not legally representing him, didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment.","Michael Egan III will be able to dismiss his lawsuit against director Bryan Singer, but can refile it later .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . An ex-Disney World princess who has played the characters of Pocahontas, Mulan and Silvermist, has submitted herself to an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit. Kristen Sotakoun, an actress and entertainer who now works on cruise ships, describes her former job warmly as bringing 'unlimited magic feelings forever.' When she wasn't being hit on by kids' older relatives that is. 'I was hit on as Pocahontas more than Mulan or Silvermist, and it definitely has to do with the amount of clothing she's wearing,' Ms Sotakoun writes. 'There's always the family that makes the grandpa or the dad get a picture alone, and they'd whisper how pretty I was, or ask when I got off of work.' A less than magical moment: Kristen Sotakoun, an ex-Disney World princess (pictured as Mulan) has revealed that 'dads and grandpas' hit on her more or less depending on how much clothing her character wore . Ms Sotakoun is quick to add that she was never touched 'inappropriately' and that nothing 'ridiculous' ever happened with regards to creepy adults. The only other downsides of the job, she claims, involved wearing the uncomfortable Mulan costume, which was 'death in the summer,' and the occasional non-believers. She recalls one party of ten kids, all under the age of eight, who accosted her while she was playing Silvermist the fairy. 'Fly right now!' she remembers them squealing. 'See, she can't! She's a liar! Liarrrr!' Another little boy confronted her while she was playing Pocahontas - one of the few Disney characters to actually have once existed - and informed her somewhat awkwardly that that he had once visited her grave. In character: Ms Sotakoun was once accused by a team of young kids of being a 'liar' for claiming to be Silvermist the fairy (left) but not being able to fly. Pictured (right) as Pocahontas . Ms Sotakoun also discusses the rather complex set of steps required to make it as a Disney princess in the first place. First, contenders have to get through the auditions, then they are trained as 'character performers,' which are non-speaking 'fur characters' like Mickey or Minnie Mouse. Only then can employees be trained for a 'face role,' which means they can interact verbally with visitors. Ms Sotakoun writes: 'Day one is watching the movie, learning how to walk, talk and act; and day two is meet and greets with guests.' She adds that training takes longer when special accents are required, such as for British characters like Mary Poppins. She explains that employees are taught how to do their own make-up, which takes an hour or so every day, before being released to delight the children of Disney World for roughly nine-hour shifts. Adult fun: The lively entertainer (pictured) now works on a cruise ship, but speaks largely favorably about her former career at Disney World in Florida . So many autographs! Ms Sotakoun recalls that there were times she would accidentally sign credit card receipts with 'Mulan' Many children who were 'dropped' into her lap were too shy to say much, Ms Sotakoun informs her captive internet audience. 'In all honesty, I've had thousands of conversations with people where I'm the only one talking. I'm proud of that,' she remarks. Of her former colleagues, Ms Sotakoun says they were mostly 'nice,' sometimes 'nasty,' and that the Disney princes were almost always gay. And the fun and games didn't always end when employees stepped behind the curtain and out of character. 'One time in the break room, I saw Cinderella and Snow White fit comfortably under Tiana's dress,' she writes. 'When Belle came around the corner they popped out and scared her.' Asked if it was sometimes difficult to leave her characters behind her, Ms Sotakoun recalled that indeed, there were times she would accidentally sign receipts with 'Mulan.'","Kristen Sotakoun was once accused by kids of being a 'liar' while playing Silvermist because she couldn't fly .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Michael William Lutts, 50, is accused of groping a baby boy's genitals while masturbating on camera . A paediatric nurse in San Diego, California has been charged with molesting his two-month-old foster child. Michael William Lutts, 50, pleaded not guilty in federal court yesterday to a charge of sexually exploiting a child, said Darrell Foxworth, an FBI spokesman in San Diego. Court documents graphically tell of how Lutts allegedly groped the boy's genitals while masturbating, videoing the whole event. And pictures show the boy still had his hospital tag attached to his leg as he was being abused. The documents say that Lutts then taped himself again a week later, masturbating in his living room with the baby nearby. He began molesting the boy on the day he was given custody of him, and recorded images and video on a phone that was seized during a search at his College Grove home on Tuesday, an FBI agent stated in the criminal complaint. Time stamps on the images indicate that the boy was molested for at least 10 days. He can be heard crying during many of the videos, FBI agents said. Lutts is a paediatric nurse in San Diego County, and was given custody of the prematurely born boy on August 4. 'In my 28 years of being an FBI agent, it's one of the more disturbing cases,' Mr Foxworth said. 'You look at the age of the victim here. This is a helpless child.' The FBI began investigating Lutts after he was linked to an email account that authorities believe was used to send indecent images of children to a suspected distributor. FBI investigators found  hundreds more pictures and videos depicting sick images of children on computers, hard drives, CDs and other media, according to the criminal complaint. Mr Foxworth said investigators plan to examine the material to identify other possible victims, and because Lutts' job gave him access to children, they are also were asking anyone with information to come forward. Authorities  intend to look at the process by which Lutts was given care of the foster baby, who is now in protective custody. Lutts' employers, medical group Kaiser Permanente, told NBC San Diego: 'At Kaiser Permanente, our first priority is to keep our patients safe as we address their health care needs, and nothing is more important than assuring the appropriate care of our young patients. 'We hold sacred the trust our patients place in Kaiser Permanente. We will not tolerate any employee or physician abusing that trust.'","Michael William Lutts, 50, pleaded not guilty of sexually exploiting a child .

He was snapped enjoying a jazz concert at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland, on shopping trips in Illinois and tackling rides at Six Flags in Chicago. 'How did I let them talk me into this,' he wrote beneath an image of a rollecoaster at Six Flags. 'Oh well, here it goes.' Other images on his Facebook page show him at jazz concerts and food fairs in Chicago, sipping margaritas, dinners of steak and shrimp and discussions about getting a new cell phone and car. Investigators later matched up the dates of the trips on Facebook to the charges to the credit cards, the Washington Post reported. In total, he spent $4,600 on the cards, which he set up in Mutamba's name after taking his Social Security number and other details from the 26-year-old employee's file. Trips: He used the money to take trips and then posted about them on Facebook, which ultimately led to his arrest, according to reports. He shared this photo of Six Flags in Chicago in July 2012 . Having fun: He also headed to food fairs and jazz concerts and uploaded the photos to Facebook . He took the information to open up a credit card for himself, another for his niece and a Wal-Mart account, prosecutors said. After a year of his spending, bill collectors began calling Mutamba to demand the money. Investigators quickly linked Hasson to the spending. Mutamba, who moved to the U.S. from Congo six years ago, said Hasson had opened 16 accounts in his name, the Washington Post reported. 'He messed up my credit, and I am still working on trying to clear everything up. I can't get an apartment. I can't buy a house, all because of him,' Mutamba said. At work: Hasson, who has a criminal record stretching decades, is pictured outside the D.C. Checkers . Records show that Hasson has a long criminal history, including arrests and charges in Illinois, Maryland and Virginia for crimes including theft and credit card fraud, forgery and misuse. Most recently, he spent six years in prison for credit card theft and was released in 2010. Despite his lengthy record, just 10 months after his release, Hasson was employed by Checkers as a regional training manager. On Facebook, he was pictured eating ice cream outside the Washington store. In court, he explained that he had been struggling because of child support. Prosecutors said they believe there could be another victim after an employee at the same Checkers reported there had been $16,000 of fraudulent credit card purchases in her name, but Hasson and his attorney said they had not heard of the allegations.","William Hasson stole the Social Security number and other details of one of his employees to set up as many as 16 credit and store cards in his name .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . As one of the most dominant figures in British political history, his mastery of propaganda and ruthlessness have been well documented. But it seems Thomas Cromwell, the trusted chief minister of Henry VIII and pioneer of the dissolution of hundreds of the Catholic church,  also had a wild side. Previously unpublished documents, unearthed by a royal historian, have revealed the Machiavellian's taste extravagance and penchant for gambling. Previously unearthed documents revealed the political figure had a taste for expensive wines and exotic animals . Evidence of overflowing wine and food and a harem of exotic animals has been discovered by Tracy Borman, joint chief curator of Historic Royal Palaces, who has pored over his personal life to expose the intricacies of his character. Among her findings was mention of a £1,000 costume, purchased purely for the entertainment of the King, and the trail of £400 - the equivalent of around £120,000 today - on cakes and wine. Her research will be published alongside other previously unseen historical documents in Thomas Cromwell: The Untold Story of Henry VIII'S Most Faithful Servant next month. During his meteoric rise to power, Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth, and their two daughters died of the plague. His son, Gregory, survived and was married to a sister of Jane Boleyn. As for the deaths of his wife and daughters, we know nothing of Thomas's heartbreak. He never remarried, instead devoting himself to the court and the transformation of Britain's religious history. It shows a more boisterous character than the one portrayed in Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall and in television dramas. 'Piecing together details found in the many letters, notes and accounts that were seized upon his arrest, a fascinating and very personal portrayal emerges,' she told the Guardian. 'He's somebody that you'd quite like to have at a dinner party. He's great fun.' It was revealed he kept around 100 horses, a 'cage of canary birds' and greyhounds, and had a particular appetite for gambling with dice. Born the son of an alehouse keeper around 1485 very little of Cromwell's early life is known other than that he hailed from Putney, west London. The political adviser, depicted in a sketch from 1530, was executed after failing to save the marriage of King Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves . Cromwell, portrayed by James Frain in the Tudors (pictured right) in fact enjoyed extravagant parties and gambling . It is unclear what, if any, education he received but that he became fluent in Latin and Italian after fighting as a mercenary in the Italian wars of the early 16th century. After amassing a small fortune in the Netherlands, he returned to England to become a lawyer. Cromwell was executed at the behest of King Henry VII (depicted) in 1540 . Paying his way through the Inns of Court, he advanced to become Master of the Rolls and was given the attention of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, for whom he would go on to become legal secretary in 1520. Three years later he became a member of parliament and began dissolving monasteries. His mentor, Cardinal Wolsey, fell out of favour with Henry VIII after failing to grant him a divorce from Catherine of Aragon. To spite him, the King broke from Rome and announced himself head of the English Church. As a result of the fall out, hundreds of religious houses and monasteries were closed under Cromwell's dutiful eye. He was appointed to the Order of the Garter, the highest order of chivalry, for his service and made Earl of Essex in 1540. That year he convinced Henry VIII to marry Anne of Cleves after the execution of his second wife, Anne Boleyn and the death of his third, Jane Seymour. It is purported by historians the monarch hoped the union would bring him support against the Catholic church - his new bride a member of a Protestant defensive alliance. Neither the marriage or the alliance succeeded, and Henry VIII was forced to reveal why it hadn't in embarrassing detail in order to get an annulment. Furious with Cromwell, the marriage's fixer  who was already disliked with many members of the court, he withdrew his support. He was swiftly charged with heresy, treason and corruption for his efforts to protect Anne of Cleves, and executed to the joy of the Duke of Norfolk at the Tower of London in July 1540.","Documents reveal thousands was spent on cake, wine and costumes .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A five-year-old told she would never walk unaided has undergone pioneering surgery and now been offered a place at Britain's top ballet school. Matilda Duncan was born with cerebral palsy but had an operation paid for by a fundraising campaign launched by her best friend Casey Burke - who also has the debilitating condition. Now, just 13 weeks later, she is well on the road to recovery, and has been offered a place at the prestigious English National Ballet School. Best friends: Four-year-old Casey Burke, pictured far left and far right, and Matilda Duncan, 5. Casey and her family helped raise £40,000 to fund her best friend Matilda's operation . Matilda and her brother Matthew playing together after her operation significantly improved her ability to walk . Her . Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure - an operation that improves mobility by cutting nerves in the lower spine - was funded by a campaign started by . her best pal Casey, five, who suffers from a form of cerebral palsy . that cannot be fixed by the operation. The . procedure, which was carried out on May 23 at Great Ormond Street . Hospital, is not currently fully available on the NHS, so Casey, with a . little help from her mum, launched a campaign to get 25,000 people to . each donate £1 to cover the cost of the pre and post-op care. Matilda, who is also known as Tilly, said: 'I always wanted to grow up to be a dancer or a footballer, and now I can. I can't wait to start dancing, and I can play with my brother now too. 'I have Casey to thank for this. She'll be my best friend forever.' The girls, who became best friends when they met at nursery, were both born prematurely, and both have perfectly healthy twins. Matilda has an able-bodied twin brother Matthew, who is now delighted he has somebody to play football with in the family's back garden, in Hayes, west London. Mum Rachel Knowles, 41, said the difference was 'astonishing'. 'To be told your child is never going to be able to walk unaided is something no parent should ever have to be told. 'But now that Tilly has had this operation, everything in our lives has improved. 'She's happier than ever, and so is Matthew too. 'They're forever playing out in the garden now. Tilly doesn't get as tired, and neither do I. Matilda and her brother Matthew with their mother Rachel Knowles. Matilda was born with cerebral palsy . 'She still gets a bit stuck sometimes and struggles, but she's improving all the time and it's nowhere near as bad as it was. 'We've been told that in about two years, it'll be like she never had any mobility issues. 'And for her to be offered a place at a ballet school is just amazing. If anybody had done that this time last year, I would have thought they were making fun of us. 'But now Tilly's the one making her own fun, and it's brilliant.' Matilda has now been accepted into London's top ballet school . The NHS pay for the operation itself but Great Ormond Street Hospital require parents to fund the expensive rehabilitation. But the 'Walking Matilda' campaign went viral, and raised £40,000 in a little over two days, meaning Matilda's family have been able to pay for her operation, and donate the rest towards another little child's operation. Matilda's shop-worker mother has been with her project manager partner Matthew Duncan, 41, for 18 years. Matilda's family discovered she was eligible for the revolutionary Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure just before Christmas. Her mother said: 'I'm so happy. When we first found out that Matilda could have the operation, and were told it would cost us £25,648, it was bittersweet. 'We never thought we'd be able to afford it. It was heartbreaking. We never would have been able to pay for the operation without Casey, her mum, and all the wonderful and generous people who donated. 'If I could kiss each and every one of them, I would. I can't thank people enough, it's changed all of our lives for the better. 'Now when I cry it's through happiness rather than tears of sadness.' Casey, who cannot have the operation, uses a wheelchair and a walker, and lives with her parents Suzanne and Mike, in Flitwick, Bedfordshire. The English National Ballet School, based in Fulham, south west London, offers a range of classes and courses for children of all ages, and have offered Matilda a place in their juniors class which starts in October. She is now raising money for Tree of Hope, a charity which helps families in similar situations fund the same procedure.

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . and Associated Press . Personal conflict, not religion, was the driving motive behind beard-and hair-cutting attacks targeting Amish, an appeals court panel ruled Wednesday in overturning the hate-crime convictions of 16 men and women. A 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with arguments brought by attorneys for the Amish defendants, who were convicted two years ago in five attacks in 2011. The attacks were in apparent retaliation against Amish who had defied or denounced the authoritarian style of Sam Mullet Sr, leader of the Bergholz community in eastern Ohio. Scroll down for video . Sam Mullet stands in front of his Bergholz, Ohio, home in 2011. He was given a 15-year sentence for attacks on other members of the Amish community . In a deeply divided decision, two of the three judges on the panel concluded that the jury received incorrect instructions about how to weigh the role of religion in the attacks. They also said prosecutors should have had to prove that the assaults wouldn't have happened but for religious motives. 'When all is said and done, considerable evidence supported the defendants' theory that interpersonal and intra-family disagreements, not the victims' religious beliefs, sparked the attacks,' the judges wrote. They said it was unfair to conclude that 'because faith permeates most, if not all, aspects of life in the Amish community, it necessarily permeates the motives for the assaults in this case.' Church leaders, 'whether Samuel Mullet or Henry VIII, may do things, including committing crimes or even creating a new religion, for irreligious reasons,' they wrote. Mullet has served nearly three years of his 15-year sentence, while seven other men in the community are serving between five and seven years in prison. The other eight Amish convicted in the attacks either already served one year in prison and have returned to their communities or are about to be released from two-year sentences. Hearing: (From left) Johnny Mullet, Lester Mullet, Daniel Mullet, Levi Miller and Eli Miller wait to make their pleas in Holmes County Municipal Court in Millersburg, Ohio, in 2011, during the hair-cutting trial. They were all eventually found guilty . Guilty: (From left) Levi Miller, Johnny Mullet and Lester Mullet, of Bergholz, Ohio, all received jail sentences for beard-and-hair cutting . Defense attorney Wendi Overmyer, who represents the Amish, said she likely would be seeking the release of Mullet and the seven other men as the government considers its appeal options. 'Sam and the rest of the defendants pose no danger to the community, they don't pose a flight risk,' she said. 'They're needed at their homes.' U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach said prosecutors are 'reviewing the opinion and considering our options.' 'We respectfully disagree with the two judges who reversed the defendants' hate crime convictions based on a jury instruction,' he said. 'We remain in awe of the courage of the victims in this case, who were subject to violent attacks by the defendants.' Amish, who live in rural communities organized around bishops, dress and live simply and shun many aspects of the modern age such as electricity, refrigeration and computers. They don't drive and often get around in horse-drawn buggies or by paying drivers to shuttle them places. They believe the Bible instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards once they marry. Cutting it is considered shameful and doing so forcibly is considered offensive. In a strong dissenting opinion of the 6th Circuit's Wednesday ruling, Judge Edmund A. Sargus, Jr. wrote that religion was a clear motive for the 2011 attacks and that the hate-crime convictions were appropriate, especially against Mullet. Sargus quoted several statements made by Mullet acknowledging his religious motivations, including in an interview with The Associated Press in which he said that the goal of the hair-cutting was to send a message to the Amish community and that he should be allowed to punish people who break church laws. The convictions of members of the Bergholz community marked the first involving religion under a federal hate crime statute enacted in 2009 in response to the murders of Matthew Shepard because he was gay and James Byrd Jr. because he was black. Attorneys for the Amish defendants have argued that the statute was meant for egregious offenses motivated by race, sexual orientation and religion, not for what their clients did. 'The impetus behind the hate-crime statute, the Matthew Shepard tragedy and James Bird - those are heinous, egregious, tragic crimes, and I think in responding to those crimes, (the statute) is a little overbroad, and I think it can have an effect that perhaps Congress didn't intend,' Overmyer said. 'This is a really good case that exemplifies where that line can be drawn of what is a hate crime and what is not a hate crime.' The ruling will make it more difficult for federal prosecutors to obtain hate-crime convictions, because the court made it clear evidence must show the crime was based solely on religious hatred, said Ric Simmons, an Ohio State University law professor. 'It's always hard to prove state of mind or motive of a defendant,' Simmons said. 'Now it's going to be even harder because you have to prove not only was this a reason why they did it, you have to prove this is essentially the only reason, or the motivating reason.' At sentencing, Judge Dan Aaron Polster said it was clear to him and the jury that the attacks were motivated by religion and that 'anyone who says this is just a hair-and beard-cutting case wasn't paying any attention.' 'These victims were terrorized and traumatized,' he said. '(The attacks) were calculated to inflict the maximum emotional trauma and distress on the victims, and that's what they did.'","Sixteen Amish men and women were jailed in 2011 for attacking other Amish .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A seaside resort is expecting to be hit by swarms of treasure hunters after an artist buried 30 pieces of gold bullion on a beach - worth £10,000. German artist Michael Sailstorfer has hidden the 24-carat gold bars on the Outer Harbour beach in Folkestone, on the Kent coast, as part of the town's arts festival. Although the celebrations don't start until Saturday, Mr Sailstorfer told people to start looking for the gold bricks from 4pm today - because they can keep what they find. Scroll down for video . Some expert treasure hunters arrive at the beach with proper shovels and a metal detector . Dozens of people descended upon the beach as soon as the tide withdrew at 4pm this afternoon . The 10g and 20g gold bars, pictured, have been buried in the Outer Harbour beach in Folkestone . The bricks, of different sizes, have been hidden underneath the sands on the beach by the artist, who is expecting thousands of would-be treasure hunters to show up with their bucket and spade and start searching. The installation, entitled 'Folkestone Digs', is funded by Bristol-based designers Situations. Director Claire Doherty said: 'So often public art funding is spent on a static sculpture or a bauble on a roundabout and part of what we do is to say, actually sometimes a temporary project can have as much impact in the collective memory as something that has been there a long time.' Among those looking to recover part of the £10,000 fortune were families visiting the area . Festival organiser Lewis Biggs added: 'I think we might well have a lot of people. German artist Michael Sailstorfer buried the gold nuggets on the beach in advance of the festival . 'It's a participatory artwork, about people coming to the beach and digging and possibly finding hidden treasure. 'Some people will get lucky, some people will not get lucky. That's life.' The beach where the gold is buried is only accessible at low tide, meaning treasure-hunters only have a small window each day in which to find their fortune. Within half an hour of the sands being exposed by the dropping tide, around 150 eager diggers had crammed onto the small beach, hoping to get lucky. The promise of gold, split into 10g and 20g bars, is expected to bring thousands of people to the beach over the coming days. The shifting tides means that searching was only possible until 9pm this evening. At this time of year, the tide is out on the beach from 6am to 11:30am and from 4pm to 9pm. Berlin-based Michael Sailstorfer, 35, has made a reputation for himself for staging elaborate productions, including gluing every leaf back onto a tree in the depths of winter, and slowly burning a log cabin on a stove until only the metal was left. Treasure hunters took different approaches in seeking their fortune with some more determined than others .

"By . Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia . A hate-filled American church group has labelled Australian comedian Adam Hills 'corrupt' in a vile rant after he decided to donate money to the late Robin William's favourite children's hospital instead of paying for them to fly to Iraq. Westboro Baptist church member, Benjamin Phelps, is angry that Hills did not give money to the church to fly to Iraq and picket ISIS like he originally joked during his British comedy show The Last Leg. 'You idiots can't do anything right ... the only reason you parted with any of your money was out of spite and hatred for Westboro,' Phelps said. Hills has so far raised over $100,000 for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, after his public spat with Westboro Baptist Church last week. He donated the money and urged his fans to do the same. 'Not only will it help a child, it will really piss of a bigot,' he said. Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is an American unaffiliated Baptist church that believes Williams spent his life 'mocking God and promoting sin' and 'pushing flagrant debauchery, and hedonism.' Scroll down for video . Angry: Westboro Baptist church member, Benjamin Phelps, is disappointed that Adam Hills is not giving the church money to fly to Iraq and picket ISIS . The funny man declared his feud with Westboro over in a segment of his comedy show on Channel 4 this weekend after becoming embroiled in a Twitter battle with the church when they claimed 'Robin Williams was in hell' for staring as a gay character in various films and supporting US troops. On Wednesday, in a disturbing video published on YouTube, Phelps said: 'Recently an Australian comedian named Adam Hills threw a hissy fit regarding our comments on the demon-possessed pervert Robin Williams.' Phelps is the eldest grandson of the church's original founder Fred Phelps and in 1995 was convicted of assault and disorderly conduct after spitting upon the face of a passerby during a picket. 'God hates signs': Adam Hills has poked fun at Westboro Baptist Church again but said their war of words is over . Comedian Adam Hills said he is still receiving abuse from people despite donating money to a good cause . In his shocking diatribe he accused Hills of making 'a big show by donating money to St Jude Children's Research Hospital'. After quoting the Bible, he continued: 'He made an oath in front of God and everyone that he would purchase these tickets first class so they least he could do is stop being so stingy with his money.' Phelps claimed he still wants the first flight out to Baghdad from Kansas for his 75 church members on Friday. 'If I'm doing my math right that comes to $904,425. You can't pay your way out of hell Adam Hills, but you ought to put your money where your big mouth is or cough up the fill amount to St Jude's. Amen.' The threat to pick Williams' funeral originally angered Hills and he fired a shot at the church on his television show, offering to fly members 'first class' to Iraq to picket extreme Islamists instead. Shocking: Phelps accused Hills of making 'a big show by donating money to St Jude Chidren's Research Hospital' 'If you really believe in standing up to those threatening the Christian way of life, Westboro Baptist Church, how about putting your money where your mouth is, taking a direct flight to Iraq and picketing the people threatening to behead Christians if they don’t convert?,' he said. Then on Saturday's show he said; 'We did seriously look into this and took onboard the advice of both the US and UK governments, neither of which were too happy about us sending professional s**t stirrers into a war zone.' Westboro Baptist Church seemed enthusiastic about the idea of going to the Middle East. They tweeted Hills saying: 'Cough up the tickets funny man, we got our bags packed. Iraq needs some preaching.' 'These guys are so desperate for attention they make Lady Gaga look like Salman Rushdie.' Hills joked. The Australian comedian said he wants to spread 'love not hate' The Westboro Baptist Church said Hills should provide their plane tickets to Iraq or be quiet . Instead of giving the church the publicity they wanted Hills said he is going to 'fight hate with love'. His Crowd Rise fundraising page, set up by charity Planting Peace, says: 'Our neighbors at the Westboro Baptist Church have announced their intention to protest the funeral of Robin Williams. 'In keeping with our philosophy of addressing acts of hate and intolerance with compassion and love, we are inviting the public to show their respect and support of a man who spent his life making others smile, who was always there for others in their time of need, and who supported the greater good through works of service and charity. In response to Hills rant, the Westboro Church claimed it had picketed in Iraq before . Robin Williams was the subject of an anti-gay video posted by the Westboro Church . 'Please join Planting Peace in counteracting the WBC’s message of hate through a fundraising event benefiting St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a cause Mr. Williams passionately and publicly supported.' Hills said there was one or two things he believed would happen to church members in Iraq, if they chose to fly. 'Either you’ll die while defending your beliefs and you’ll be carried away to heaven by a gold chariot to sit at the right hand of God for all eternity.' 'OR if I’m right, and I’m willing to bet a dozen first class flights that I am, God will be standing at the pearly gates alongside a 5ft 8 hairy American comedian dressed as a middle aged Scottish nanny saying, ‘Heeeellllooooo’. Robin Williams played an openly gay character in the film The Birdcage, one of many gay characters he portrayed. The Westboro Baptist Church members failed to show up to Williams’ memorial service, which was held in San Francisco on Tuesday, but they did respond to Hills on Twitter, saying, 'Iraq here we come.'

Elizabeth police say it appears 32-year-old Maria Fernandes of Newark was overcome by a deadly mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gasoline container. She kept the extra gas in her 2001 Kia Sportage because occasionally she ran out of gas, authorities said. Maria Fernandes of Newark was overcome by a deadly mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gasoline container while trying to rest between one of her four jobs . Lt. Daniel Saulnier tells The Star-Ledger of Newark it sounds like someone who tried desperately to work and make ends meet and met with a tragic accident. She worked four jobs, including two shifts at separate Dunkin Donuts. Saulnier says an autopsy failed to determine the cause of death and police are awaiting toxicology test results. No foul play is suspected. Police believe Fernandes pulled over for a nap in a parking lot early Monday. The Star-Ledger reports she often drove from job to job and caught a few hours sleep on the road between. She apparently left the car running while she tried to rest. Police were called later that afternoon. She was found with the windows and the doors to the vehicle shut, and when emergency workers burst in they reported a chemical odor. Hazmat was called to the scene upon determining Fernandes was dead. Fernandes was found near this Wawa shop with her car's engine still running and a strong chemical odor filling the air . The Star-Ledger notes that Fernandes was only of tens of thousands of New Jersey workers employed at multiple jobs. 'These are folks who would like to work full-time but they can't find jobs,' Carl Van Horn, director of John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, told reporters. 'They wind up in these circumstances in which they are exhausted. More commonly it creates just an enormous amount of stress.' At least 7.5 million people nationwide are working multiple jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. For those who lost their jobs in the recession of 2008, many now working multiple positions still make less than their full-time wages and with little or no benefits. 'The average person who lost their job took a 10 per cent pay cut, (after returning to the workforce),' Van Horn said.","Maria Fernandes, 32, of Newark, was allegedly overcome by mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gas can .

So far the process has involved secret hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Maloney said: ‘I wasn’t born into the right body, I have always known I was a woman. Turmoil: The 61-year-old admits the pressure and confusion caused by her struggles with her identity caused battles with drink, depression and drugs . Out and about: Pictured, the 61-year-old former promoter in June . Kellie says she kept her turmoil in the shadows because she feared a backlash from the notoriously macho world of boxing. Top of their game: Frank Maloney (in Union Flag suit), right, with WBC World Heavyweight Champ Lennox Lewis, left, in Atlantic City in October 1997 . Living a lie: Maloney (left, as a man in 1998) admitted she has felt trapped in a man's body since she was a child. Right, Lennox Lewis and Maloney in 1989. They would go on to reach the very peak of boxing . ‘Living with the burden any longer would have killed me. The feeling of wanting to be like and dress like a woman has always been there. ‘I consciously made the decision that I wouldn’t dress like a woman, but it was a constant urge.’ Maloney, who was known for wearing Union Jack suits, said it would have been impossible to tell anyone in the macho world of boxing – despite making the careers of British Commonwealth and European champions such as cruiserweight title holder David Haye. ‘Can you imagine me walking into a boxing hall dressed as a woman and putting an event on? I can imagine what they would scream at me,’ she revealed. ‘But if they had been in the theatre or arts world nobody would blink an eye about this transition.’ Maloney, who had a box at Millwall football club, described how he told second wife Tracey, 47, about the transition at their home in Chislehurst, south-east London. ‘We were standing in the kitchen and I said, “I have to tell you I have lived with this all my life. I have lived a lie and I really am a female in my head”,’ she said. The promoters: Don King (right), promoting Evander Holyfield, with Frank Maloney, manager of WBC champion Lennox Lewis in 1998 . ‘As the words started to come out I wanted to catch them and pull them back in. I looked at her face and I knew my marriage was over. ‘I went upstairs and I broke down. She came up and I told her I was going to our house abroad. ‘I was not happy when the relationship ended. It had been a security net around me. But it was the first step of me starting life as a woman.’ Maloney insists she doesn’t want a new relationship. Born in Peckham, South London, the former promoter has been politically active in the past. In 2004, Maloney stood as an independent during the London mayoral vote and was the Ukip candidate in Barking, East London, at the 2010 general election. Yesterday, a number of boxers expressed their support. Former WBO cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson said: ‘Ignorance is the problem of others, not yours.’ Former welterweight champion Ricky Hatton added: ‘He’s still a top guy, so I don’t care.’ And Lennox Lewis posted on Facebook: ‘This world we live in isn’t always cut and dried or black and white, and coming from the boxing fraternity, I can only imagine what a difficult decision this must be for Kellie.’ Yesterday both Maloney and wife Tracey both declined to comment. By JANE FAE . Transgender writer and campaigner . While many might be shocked by Frank Maloney’s transition into Kellie, it comes as no surprise to me. There’s no rule which says that hairdressers are more likely to be transgender than sporting professionals. If anything, the opposite holds true. There is so much blame and shame about being transgender that many will do all they can to hide it – often taking up careers that exaggerate their birth gender. So men may be more macho and women more feminine. It can make the transition more of a shock to other people, but not to those who have been through it. For me, that was four years ago. Happily settled with my partner of seven years and two young children, I decided aged 52 that I could no longer live as a man and needed to become ‘Jane’. Support often arrives from unexpected directions. I was working as a science and technology writer, and the atmosphere in the office was laddish. I dreaded returning to work as Jane, but I was surprised and grateful for the nonchalant way my male colleagues reacted. One said of my painted nails ‘the colour doesn’t suit you’, while the rest just got on with work as usual. Friendships endured. Family members were supportive. My partner stood by me. And that’s how it should be. My heart goes out to Kellie. Transition opens the door to public abuse and discrimination – but for some people changing gender is necessary, and my own experience shows it can lead to happiness.","Lennox Lewis' former mentor, 61, now lives as a woman called Kellie .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A new art exhibition at one of Britain's top galleries has been branded racist for using black actors dressed up as slaves. Exhibit B, by South African artist Brett Bailey, features live performers including a black man in a cage and a semi-naked woman with shackles around her neck. An online petition calling for the show to be axed has been signed by 6,000 people since it was launched last week. Exhibit B, by South African artist Brett Bailey, features a semi-naked woman with shackles around her neck . A petition calling for the show to be axed has been signed by 6,000 people since it was launched last week . Community activists are also drawing up plans for a demonstration over Exhibit B outside the Barbican. It is set to take place at the Barbican between September 23 and 27 - and those at the art centre have defended the exhibition, despite the accusations of racism. Already seen in various European capitals, the work has attracted criticism, particularly in Berlin, where it caused fury among anti-racism campaigners, who questioned the authority of a white director to tackle the story of black exploitation. The controversial show most recently ran in Edinburgh until August 25. Mr Bailey's inspiration is the 19th century phenomenon of the human zoo, by which people of colour were displayed as museum objects to white Europeans and Americans. The artist has recruited a number of people of African and Afro-Caribbean origin and arranged them as living sculptures that offer a painful reminder of the appalling history of colonialism and racial hatred. The controversial exhibition will take place at the Barbican from September 23 to September 27 . But the exhibition has been attacked by campaigners and an online petition was organised by journalist and activist, Sara Myers. She criticised the work for the lack of respect it gave to the ancestral children of the enslaved and dehumanised. She said: 'I’m calling on the Barbican not to display it. 'I am a Black African mother from Birmingham. I campaign and work with my community to try to breakdown the stereotypes that black people have to struggle against in society on a daily basis. 'I want my children to grow up in a world where the barbaric things that happened to their ancestors are a thing of the past. 'We have come a long way since the days of the grotesque human zoo - we should not be taking steps back now. 'If Brett Bailey is trying to make a point about slavery this is not the way to do it. The irony gets lost and it’s not long before the people behind the cage begin to feel like animals trapped in a zoo. 'One of the actors in his piece said “How do you know we are not entertaining people the same way the human zoos did?” At the beginning of the petition, she wrote: 'We wish to register our utmost disgust at what we consider to be an outrageous act of complicit racism with the Barbican agreeing to the housing and display of this production. 'White South African Brett Bailey claims his human zoo vanity project is “art”; just how are we as Black African's supposed to respond to this? 'This is simply an exercise in white racial privilege. If it isn’t, then perhaps Bailey can explain why he didn't use white people in his zoo? 'After all, wouldn't him doing so be both more striking and send a clearer message?' Mr Bailey's inspiration is the 19th century phenomenon of the human zoo, by which people of colour were displayed as museum objects to white Europeans and Americans . Activist Sara Myers criticised the work for the lack of respect it gave to the ancestral children of the enslaved . Zita Holbourne, co-founder of Black Activists Rising Against Cuts, said: 'We don't believe that in order to remind people of the horrors of racism, enslavement, apartheid and colonial rule it is necessary to place black people in cages and put them on display in an exhibition. 'This exhibition does nothing to promote race equality.' But Mr Bailey, a white man who grew up in apartheid South Africa, believes that his piece is thought-provoking. He said: 'Exhibit B is not a piece about black histories made for white audiences. 'It is a piece about humanity; about a system of dehumanisation that affects everybody within society, regardless of skin colour, ethnic or cultural background, that scours the humanity from the ""looker"" and the ""looked at.""' And he was defended by the Barbican's Head of Theatre, Toni Racklin. He said: 'We appreciate that the work tackles controversial and sensitive issues. 'However I’d like to assure you that Exhibit B aims to subvert and challenge racial or cultural Otherness, not to reinforce it. 'Exhibit B involves performers demonstrating the brutal reality behind colonisation accompanied by text that reveals the historical context of each scenario. 'The piece aims to explore the relationship between Western powers and Africa, ranging from exposing the abhorrent historical attitudes to race during the colonial era to questioning how far our society has moved on, by holding up a mirror to contemporary issues such as the current treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers. 'It provokes audiences to reflect on the historical roots of today’s prejudices and policies and how these have been shaped over centuries. 'Previous performances of Exhibit B, such as in Amsterdam, Brussels and most recently Edinburgh, have attracted a diverse and politically engaged audience and it has been seen as a watershed work that provokes discussion about racism and the historical roots of prejudices.'","Exhibit B, by artist Brett Bailey, has been branded racist by campaigners .

"By . Catherine Townsend . Over the past year, a dizzying array of BB (Blemish or Beauty Balm) and CC (Color Correcting) creams have stormed beauty shelves across the country. Just when we thought we had finally figured out the alphabet formulas, Juice Generation has launched a 'DD', or 'Dynamic Do-All', skin shot that claims to work from the inside out. We road tested the new shot, which was created with celebrity dermatologist Dr David Colbert and contains green tea and guarana. Taking a shot: The DD mini-drinks by Juice Generation like Aloe Vera, E3 Live and Bee Pollen + Maca all contain ingredients that are meant to give a big nutritional boost in a single sip . In . portion size and possible health benefits, Juice Generation founder . Eric Helms claims that the shots are like 'next generation wheatgrass' - but without the distinctive taste. Priced at $3.95 each, the mini-drinks are becoming a growing trend . among Type A New Yorkers who want a boost before a post-work gym session . or afternoon meeting. The ingredients in the latest DD shot claim to have benefits ranging from easing eczema symptoms to aiding weight loss. When downed the ice-cold mini-drink (it's meant to be kept refrigerated) in one gulp, my first impression was that it tasted a lot like flavored iced tea - perfect for a summer day pick-me-up. It was refreshing and much lighter than the plant-based fresh booster shots I buy at the juice bar. Glowing skin: Miranda Kerr credits her organic diet with helping her achieve an amazing complexion . And while my complexion did not immediately glow like Miranda Kerr's, I did notice that I powered straight through the afternoon without experiencing my usual 4 pm slump. This made sense once I did a quick search of the ingredients, and discovered that guarana is also a stimulant whose seeds contain around twice as much caffeine as coffee plants. Juice Generation has launched six shots previously, all with different ingredients. Among them are Sea Buckthorn, made from a hand-harvested Himalayan berry thought to have beauty-boosting properties, E3 Live, and Bee Pollen + Maca, which Juice Generation calls 'nature's multivitamin.' A spokesperson for the New York Dermatology Group, where Dr. Colbert is based, explained that the nutritional supplements aren't meant to have an immediate effect, but to be used as part of a healthy diet. In addition to his more aggressive beauty treatments like lasers and Botox, Dr. Colbert advises his patients to drink a cup of green tea and take a fish oil capsule every day. The idea is that over time - unlike a tequila shot - DDs can help improve the appearance of skin.","Juice Generation just launched 'Dynamic Do-All', or DD, shots in New York .

A British man died in Thailand after getting high on cocaine then running into a plate glass door, local police said. Police found Jason Flannery, 25, a talented former schoolboy athlete from North Yorkshire, dead in a sixth floor flat in Pattaya, a city popular with tourists, at 3am. His face and chest were covered in cuts, police told local media. It is believed that he bled to death after severing an artery in his neck. Mr Flannery's girlfriend, Janjira Buapae, 23, told police that she returned from work to their flat in the Spanish Place Pattay apartment complex to find Jason in what local media described as 'a serious discussion' with a friend and another woman. Later, she said, Mr Flannery mixed cocaine with water and drank it, before smoking a spliff. Ms Janjira said she rowed with her boyfriend and decided to leave the room. Mr Flannery pursued her into the hallway, according to reports, where their argument drew a crowd of onlookers. Ms Janjira claimed Mr Flannery, alarmed by the crowd, ran back in to his flat and straight into a glass door. He fell down and died soon afterwards. Sawang Boriboon rescue volunteers, Pattaya Police and Bang Lamung Hospital medics were called to the flat but Mr Flannery had already died from his wounds. Mr Flannery, originally from Leyburn, North Yorkshire, was a former pupil at Wensleydale School, where he had won plaudits for his athleticism. As a teenager he won the Yorkshire County AAA 1500m title, scored a hat-trick in five minutes with Richmond Town FC juniors team to secure the Cleveland Challenge Cup and was awarded the John Bowles Cup by his school for outstanding achievement in sport.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A leading German politician has taken a significant step towards implementing an 'anti-stress law' - banning employers from contacting workers outside office hours. Employment minister, Andrea Nahles, has commissioned a report to asses the viability of new legislation in the wake of rising stress levels and work-related mental health issues in Germany. The report will examine the effect of people being in constant contact with their office - a trend blamed largely on the popularity of smartphones. Supporting investigation: German employment minister, Andrea Nahles (above) has commissioned the report to assess the viability of introducing an 'anti-stress law' It is already illegal under German law for companies to ask employees to do any work while on holiday, including answering emails. But Ms Nahles suggests the law needs to go further as high working demands mean people are finding it impossible to switch off when they are at home. She told the Rheinische Post newspaper: 'There is an undeniable relationship between having to be constantly available and the rise in mental illness.' Recent surveys have confirmed that Germans tend to take their work home with them leading to high levels of of stress. Rising problem: Levels of stress and work-related mental health issues are said to be on the rise in Germany, according to recent surveys (man featured is a model) Health insurer Techniker Krankenkasse found in a report last year that stress levels had increased in the last 12 months for 53 per cent of the people their surveyed, The Local reports. And in August last year, a television programme called 'Stressed Germany' also investigated the country's growing problem. The programme revealed that the number of sick days taken as a result of mental illnesses had risen by 80 per cent in the last 15 years. Germany’s coalition government promised that they would improve people's 'work-life balance' in their coalition agreement last year.","Politician Andrea Nahles claims work stress is cause of rising mental health .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A lucky football fan has won £1,250 after accidentally tipping MK Dons to beat Manchester United 4-0. Aviation worker Holly Griffiths, 20, decided to take a punt on United for their second round Capital One Cup clash with League One outfit MK Dons. But instead of placing her £2.50 free bet from bookies Paddy Power on the Red Devils, she lumped it on the Dons. Holly Griffiths (left) won £1,250 by accidentally betting against Manchester United with a £2.50 wager (right) In doing so, she was just one of 14 people in the UK to do so at a cool 500/1, meaning her return was a hefty £1,250. The Manchester United fan, from Manchester, said: 'I put a bet on United last Sunday with Paddy Power, I have the app on my phone. 'Because they lost, I got my money back as a free bet and forgot about it until I was in the pub with my mates last night. 'I don't really bet - only the odd quid here and there - but my mate told me she had put on United to win 4-0, so I thought I might as well do that with my free bet. 'I also put a pound on us to win 3-0 - well I thought I did but I obviously wasn't concentrating and clicked the wrong button so I bet on MK Dons. 'I stopped watching it after it was 3-0 as for me it wasn't much fun anymore. 'It was only when I checked my app again at 3-0 that I realised what had happened, it was a weird feeling.

'My friends were joking around saying I should give them a cut, I have taken the money out of the betting account, but I just don't know what to do with it yet.'

One woman hastily led her child away from the hungry birds as they swooped down on the beach. But the pelicans weren't interested in the humans and made a beeline for the shoal of fish swimming along the shore. While some bathers hurried back to the beach, others are seen wading into the water to catch a closer glimpse of the phenomenon. Almost in formation, the pelicans dive into the water one after another to catch the sardines. Fisherman Maximiliano Ricci, who travelled to Crucita in Ecuador from Italy for a holiday, captured the feeding frenzy on camera.

"By . Reuters . A federal judge signaled on Wednesday he may order the government to release as many as 2,000 photographs depicting the alleged harsh treatment of detainees in U.S. custody at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and other sites. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in New York ruled the U.S. Department of Defense had failed to show why releasing the photographs would endanger the lives of American soldiers and workers abroad. He also said former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta apparently had not considered each individual photograph before determining in late 2012 that all of them should remain secret. Images that shocked the world: Soldier Lynndie England holding a leash attached to a prisoner, known to the guards as 'Gus at Abu Ghraib. She was courts-martialled in 2005. Another image of a prisoner being tortured made the cover of The Economist in 2004. A judge indicated on Wednesday he may order the U.S. government to release more pictures of alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq and at other sites . Hellerstein said he would let the government submit additional evidence justifying its finding before ordering the photographs released. He scheduled a hearing for September 8 on the issue. 'During the course of this litigation, I have reviewed some of these photographs and I know that many of these photographs are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration,' he wrote. The Defense Department did not immediately comment on the ruling. The photographs would be released in redacted form to conceal the identities of any individuals. Former Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut said in 2009 that there were nearly 2,100 photographs, Hellerstein said. The dispute, prompted by a 2004 lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, concerns documents, photographs and videos related to the treatment and death of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad following the attacks of September 11, 2001. A handful of images depicting abuse at Abu Ghraib would emerge in 2004, prompting a public debate over whether the United States had engaged in torture through enhanced interrogation techniques. In 2005, Hellerstein ruled that the government had to release photographs and videos documenting prisoner treatment at Abu Ghraib, a decision that was upheld on appeal. The ACLU, in response to the potential release of images from Abu Ghraib (pictured) and other of detaineess in U.S. custody, said: 'We have a right to know what resulted from senior officials' decision to authorize and tolerate the abuse and torture of prisoners' But before the images became public, then-Iraqi President Nuri al-Maliki urged the U.S. government in 2009 to withhold the photographs to avoid creating further unrest in his country. In response, Congress passed a law that blocked their release if the defense secretary certified it might endanger American lives. Panetta's predecessor, Robert Gates, issued such a finding in 2009 and Hellerstein accepted it in 2011. In 2012, when Gates' three-year certification was about to expire as per the statute, Panetta issued a new certification, but Hellerstein said on Wednesday that circumstances had changed. 'Three years is a long time in war, the news cycle, and the international debate over how to respond to terrorism,' he wrote. Lawyers for the government argued Hellerstein is not entitled to review Panetta's decision, a position the judge rejected. Marcellene Hearn, an ACLU attorney, said in a statement that the photographs were disturbing, but should be made public. 'We have a right to know what resulted from senior officials' decision to authorize and tolerate the abuse and torture of prisoners,' she added.","Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled the Department of Defense failed to show why releasing photos would endanger lives of U.S. soldiers and workers abroad .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . This shows the  split second before the nine-year-old girl shoots Charles Vacca in the head. She appears to have lost her double handed grip on the Uzi as it recoils after firing . Just hours after a nine-year girl accidentally shot and killed her gun instructor, the National Rifle Association tweeted ‘7 ways children can have fun at the shooting range’. The 'ill-timed' tweet posted by NRA Women, which linked to an article on Women’s Outdoor News, was deleted without an apology or explanation. It has been criticised as ‘tasteless’, as the article was shared less than two days after a young girl in Arizona lost control of a sub-machine gun, striking 39-year-old Charles Vacca. A shocking recording from the Bullets and Burgers shooting range in White Hills, Arizona, shows the moment the nine-year-old girl shot Mr Vacca with an Uzi on Monday. The video, taken by the girl's parents and released by police, shows Mr Vacca standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode. His last words to the girl are: 'Alright, full auto.' The nation's largest gun lobby has now come under fire for posting a ‘tasteless’ tweet on Wednesday, so soon after this accident. In the article, parents are encouraged to introduce different types of targets to engage young shooters who have grown bored with the standard bull's-eye. Mutants and zombie targets are among those suggested, with author Mia Anstine saying: ‘We’re not sure if they will frighten young children, or if they can imagine they’re getting rid of the monsters from their nightmares. Regardless, they do look like lots of fun.’ The article itself is dated August 20, five days before the tragic Arizona shooting, which occurred at a popular shooting range near Las Vegas. People have taken to social media to criticise the NRA's ill-timed tweet. Scroll down for video . The tweet was posted by NRA Women at 4.51pm on August 27, just hours after the shooting on August 25 . Charles Vacca, a father and veteran from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, teaches the 9-year-old girl how to handle the Uzi at the Bullets and Burgers shooting range in White Hills, Arizona . Director at Equality Missouri, Aaron Malin, tweeted: 'This is not the best timing'. Mark Follman said: 'In the wake of the horrible Arizona Uzi killing, the NRA tweets about 7 ways for kids to have fun at the gun range'. Vicky Baker said: 'These are not enough words to describe how insensitive this is.' Sarah Felstead tweeted: 'This is incredibly tasteless. Could there be worse timing?' In the video of the accident, Mr Vacca is seen  instructing the girl to hold the weapon with two hands at all times and to take a perpendicular stance to the target. Then Mr Vacca asks her to fire one shot for him, which she does. He then tells the girl to adjust her stance and squeeze the trigger to let off a volley, but something goes wrong when she fires a second time. The girl loses her two-handed grip on the weapon and it pulls to her left, striking Mr Vacca in the head. Charles Vacca,  a staff sergeant, passed away on Monday night after helping a nine-year-old at a shooting range . The Israeli-made submachine gun can fire almost 30 rounds per second, according to the manufacturer. Mr Vaca from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, was airlifted to hospital on Monday morning after the little girl shot him but died that evening. Mohave County Sheriff Jim McCabe said the full video of the incident was 'ghastly'. He said that the girl had successfully fired the weapon several times before when it was set on 'single shot' mode. However, the horrific accident unfolded in a split second when the Israeli made weapon was set to 'full-automatic mode' and caused Mr Vacca his fatal injuries. 'The guy just dropped,' Mr McCabe said of the former soldier, who suffered more than one gunshot to the head. Mr McCabe told the Las Vegas Review Journal that no charges will be filed because Bullets and Burgers is licensed and legal as an operation. The nine-year-old girl, who has not been identified, was not injured. She was with her parents as they passed through the area on vacation from New Jersey. The range operator at Bullets and Burgers told KLAS-TV he was shocked by the incident. 'We really don't know what happened. Our guys are trained to basically hover over people when they're shooting. If they're shooting right-handed, we have our right-hand behind them ready to push the weapon out of the way. And if they're left-handed, the same thing,' operator Sam Scarmardo said.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . British military ammunition is being used on the streets of Merseyside . British military bullets are being used by criminals on the streets of Merseyside as new figures reveal 18 guns and almost 2,000 bullets were lost or stolen from the Ministry of Defence last year. Documents have revealed ammunition that can be identified as British military was responsible for 46 per cent of the bullets discharged in the Merseyside area between April and October 2012. This comes as new figures show 18 firearms and almost 2,000 Ministry of Defence rounds of ammunition were lost or stolen last year. The Times reported an internal army document as stating the availability of ammunition on Merseyside streets was good - evidenced by incidents where there were multiple bullets fired. A former soldier also told the paper that army divers had recently discovered thousands of live rounds in a pond at a Northumberland firearms training area. He said: 'At the end of a range session you have two official ways to dispose of ammunition. 'Either you've fired it so it's spent, or it has to be accounted for, signed back in and dealt with as fairly high-security stores. 'There is a third option where you dispose of it some unofficial way, either bung it in a pond or sell it to gangsters.' However, Merseyside criminals are not the only ones benefiting from lost military firearms. The number of British weapons recorded lost during the Afghanistan conflict reached double figures - with a spike of 57 automatic weapons lost and never recovered in 2010. While no weapons were earmarked as lost or stolen during the conflict in 2006, that year more than 2,100 rounds of ammunition disappeared. In December 2007, the Ministry of Defence revealed the gun used to shoot WPC Rachael Bown, 24, in the stomach in Nottingham in 2006 had been stolen from the Army. The Browning 9mm pistol used in the attack had been stolen from a British military base or smuggled by troops from Afghanistan or Iraq and sold to thugs by a soldier.

She knew things that normally people wouldn’t know,' Cole recalled to the National Post about the phone call from Parent Finders. Brothers: Duncan Cumming (right) has left Canada to live in his wife's home island of Guernsey in the English Channel. Cole (left) lives with his wife in Saskatchewan. They have planned a reunion for September . It turned out, Cumming had reached out to the group in an effort to find his birth mother. Parent Finders then tracked down Cole. 'I started to listen.

Their parents even vacationed once together and, by some incredible coincidence, they'd each saved the same black and white photo of the two of them aged 11 or 12 standing seaside.

There's something very grounded about Jennifer that seems to gel with Chris . And with a 13-year age gap - Jen's 24, Chris is 37 - can this really work long-term? The naysayer's say no. With more than a decade between them, what points of reference do Chris and Jen have? They've grown up with different music, TV, movies, what do they talk about? Chris has two children already, won't Jen want to have hers with someone who'll experience it with her for the very first time? What about the power dynamic? Jen's the younger partner and in the 'pupil' position. Chris has lived longer so probably (hopefully) knows more. Tracey says acceptance levels of age-gap relationships has never been higher . The power's automatically on his side: won't Jen view him as a teacher or parent, someone to hide things from if she's been 'naughty'? As the older partner, won't Jen's lack of experience and wisdom be frustrating for Chris? He's been through all the experiences she's about to and who really wants to go back for round two? Do age-gap relationships ever really work long-term? Well, actually, yes they can - and do! Being around the same age is a rough predictor of having common ground but it doesn't guarantee synchron­isation. We are all a sum of totals. Our true maturity depends very much on what we've accomplished, our personality, genetics, life experiences, expectations and morals. There might be 13 years between Chris and Jen but, to my eye, they appear to have a lot more in common than Chris and Gwyneth ever did. Jen might glam up for the red carpet, but off duty she's parked firmly in the no-makeup and scruffy jeans camp. One reason Gwyneth and Chris didn't work out was she loved getting glammed for the LA premieres and being seen in all the right places. He reportedly detested it. Gwyneth is fanatical about health and diet, Chris decided he wasn't vegetarian quick-smart post break-up. Which is rather handy since Jen's fond of fast food and burgers. Both women are bright and undeniably elegant (who didn't fall for Jen when she so oh-so-gracefully tripped on her way to receive an Oscar). But there's something very grounded about Jennifer that seems to gel with Chris' consistent shying away from the limelight. In the face of all that common ground, does it really matter he's been on the planet for 13 more years? We constantly focus on ways society is failing us but acceptance levels of age-gap relationships has never been higher. This not only shows maturity of attitude, it's practical too! God knows, it's hard enough finding a soulmate without having to make sure you're both matching bookends. I like this new pairing and that Chris and Jen haven't let age get in the way. May I suggest they relax and enjoy - and if need be, get a few tips from Calista Flockhart and Harrison Ford (22 years difference, together 12 years) and Vivienne Westwood and Andreas Kronthaler (25 years difference, together 24 years) along the way.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A pair of Canadian fighter jets were forced to escort a flight full of holidaymakers back to Toronto after two drunk women disrupted the Cuba-bound flight and made threats against the plane. The two passengers, believed to be in their 20s, drank a large amount of duty free alcohol in the toilet, before setting off the smoke alarms by lighting a cigarette and getting in a fight. They ended up making threats against the plane, which were 'considered non-credible given their condition'. A Sunwing plane similar to the one diverted back to Toronto after two drunk women made threats against it . The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled two CF-18 fighter jets from Bagotsville, Quebec as a 'precautionary measure', diverting the Sunwing Flight 656 back to Toronto. A flight headed to Paris out of Miami had to be diverted to Logan Airport in Boston last night because of an unruly passenger interfering with flight crew. American Airlines Flight 62 flew out at around 6.40pm and was headed for Charles de Gaulle, but was back on the ground in Boston by 10pm. Massachusetts Port Authority said state police arrested a man and charged him with interfering with a flight crew. No one was injured. Sunwing said in a statement that it was 'reported that the passengers consumed a significant quantity of their duty free alcohol purchase in the lavatory and lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke detector alarm,' NBC News reported. They then 'proceeded to get into a physical altercation with each other and made a threat against the aircraft, which was considered non-credible given their condition.' NORAD said in a statement: 'Once the aircraft was safely on the ground, the Canadian fighters returned to their home base.' The flight headed out for a second time with a new  crew to Varadero via Manzanillo, Cuba last night. Sunwing had a similar problem at the end of last month, when another flight from Toronto had to return while en-route to Panama after threats from a passenger.","Sunwing Flight 656 was headed to Cuba from Toronto on Wednesday .

"By . Gerard Couzens for MailOnline . British police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are set to return to Portugal next month after petitioning authorities for more help . Police probing Madeleine McCann's disappearance have formally petitioned for more help, Portuguese authorities have revealed. Another international letter of request has been received from Scotland Yard, Portugal's Attorney General's Office confirmed. The news comes as  officers prepare for a new trip to the Algarve next month following ground searches for missing Madeleine and interrogations of four suspects earlier this summer. Officials have declined to comment on the content of the new letter of request. It was not clear last night if public prosecutors on the Algarve coordinating the separate Portuguese inquiry into Madeleine's May 2007 disappearance have yet approved the request. Previous requests - which sparked digs at three sites in and around the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine vanished as well as the police quizzes - were submitted in July last year and January, February and May this year. A spokesman for the Lisbon-based Attorney General's Office confirmed last night: 'During the last few weeks Public Prosecution Services received from the British authorities a new Letter of Request in the context of the investigations related to the disappearance of young Madeleine McCann. 'The content of the request presented by the British authorities is classified, therefore the Prosecutor General's Office have no comments on such matter.' Reports at the weekend suggested British police working on Operation Grange - the new probe into Madeleine's disappearance - want to conduct interviews with more key suspects. Four men were interviewed as 'arguidos' - normally translated as 'formal suspects' - in July. Only one of them - Russian-born Sergey Malinka - is understood to have had his arguido status removed. British police questioned them through Portuguese colleagues in the hope of confirming their theory they were part of a burglary gang who panicked after killing Madeleine during a bungled break-in at her family's holiday apartment and dumped her body. Scroll down for video . Seven years on, Madeleine's parents are still desperate to find out what happened to their daughter . Metropolitan Police officers visited Praia da Luz earlier this summer and searched an area of wasteland . But all four men insisted they had nothing to do with her disappearance and were released without charge. A string of witnesses were also quizzed at Faro Police Station. South Wales-loaned sniffer dogs were used in June to search waste ground in Praia da Luz in a fruitless search for clues to her whereabouts and are subsequently thought to have swept the car of one of the suspects' relatives. Portuguese police have privately dismissed the latest British police work as 'senseless.' They believe Madeleine was snatched by a foreigner no longer in Portugal, although they have still not ruled out the involvement of an ex-drug addict burglar who died in a tractor accident in 2009, three years after being sacked from the holiday club where the British youngster disappeared. Euclides Monteiro's widow Luisa Rodrigues has insisted her recovering drug addict partner, a convicted burglar, had nothing to do with Madeleine's disappearance. Sniffer dogs were used in the search of the area in June but are not believed to have turned up any clues .","Metropolitan Police send latest international letter of request to Portugal .

Just two weeks after her son's disappearance, tragedy struck the family again. Melinda agreed to a televised interview with Nancy Grace and, after coming under scrutiny and being slammed by the former prosecutor for her lack of information and specifics about her son's disappearance, she killed herself the next day. In her suicide note, the 21-year-old mother wrote, 'I love [Trenton] and only wanted him safe in my arms. You created rumors and twisted words. Usually I am strong and what others say does not affect me. However I am young.' 'Nancy Grace and the others, they just bashed her to the end,' Melinda's grandfather Bill Eubanks said at the time. 'She wasn't one anyone ever would have thought of to do something like this. She and that baby just loved each other, couldn't get away from each other. She wouldn't hurt a bug.' Melinda's family and estate later brought a lawsuit against Grace, and CNN, for inflicting emotional distress on Duckett with her interrogation about the missing boy. The suit was eventually settled and required Miss Grace to establish a $200,000 trust dedicated to finding Trenton.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A giant aircraft hangar which once held the world's largest flying boat and was used to film Independence Day and Transformers could soon be transformed into Google's latest offices. The former Howard Hughes Aircraft space is just north of Los Angeles International Airport, and is twice the length for a football pitch and seven stories high. It was where the 'Spruce Goose' was built - the largest ever flying boat and aircraft with the biggest wingspan in history - in the 1940s. The 'Spruce Goose' under construction in the Howard Hughes hanger which could soon be Google's new home . Google is interested in taking on the hangar, the Wall Street Journal reports, and are currently in early discussions with the owners - real estate developer Ratkovich Co. The rest of the former Hughes Aircraft headquarters has already been converted, with companies such as YouTube - who are owned by Google, already based there. And the technology giant hopes to join them, by renting almost all of the whopping 300,000 square foot (nearly 28,000 square metre) space. American business tycoon Howard Hughes was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in 2004 film The Aviator . Howard Hughes' company built the hanger in 1943, and sold the airfield in the 1980s to make room for development. Ratkovich Co. bought it in 2010. Although refusing to comment on Google, chief executive Wayne Ratkovich told the Wall Street Journal that renting out the property 'was faster than we imagined, faster than we expected'. Google already has offices in California, including one in Venice which looks like a huge pair of binoculars from the front. The 750ft (230 metre) long property, called Building 15, is in Los Angeles' Playa Vista neighbourhood out of town. It has drawn a number of technology, advertising and media oriented companies in the last few years, and Ratkovich has had to cater for them as a result. Surfboard racks and barbecue pits have been installed, while food vans also come to the suburb. Despite being the set for scenes in hit sci-fi films, Building 15 is perhaps best known as home of the Spruce Goose. The huge heavy transport aircraft was built for transatlantic transport during World War II, but was not completed in time to be used. It made just one flight - on November 2, 1947. It got its name as it was made from wood - thanks to restrictions on use of aluminium during the war - but was actually built largely from birch rather than spruce. The Google UK headquarters, in Victoria, London, feature a Routemaster bus turned into a conference room . The London offices also have a ping-pong table and table football to help staff relax during shifts . It now sits in the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, where it remains in good condition. The machine was designed and built by the aircraft company of Howard Hughes - an American business tycoon of the time who was also behind hit films such as Scarface. He was an eccentric who became a recluse in later life, before dying on board a plane, his body withered down to a tiny 41kg in weight, he was almost unrecognisable. He was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in 2004 film The Aviator, which won five Academy Awards.

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman . and Alex Greg for MailOnline . The man who shot dead John Lennon outside the Beatle's New York apartment building detailed the intense planning that went into the murder, in a court hearing last week. Mark Chapman stalked the music legend for months before the shooting, shelling out on tickets to and from his home in Hawaii. Last week, the now 59-year-old appeared before a board who decided to deny him bail, perhaps in part because he continued to brag about the murder. When asked why he decided to target Lennon, Chapman said he couldn't resist the fame that would come with the crime. 'That bright light of fame, of infamy, notoriety was there,' he said. 'I couldn't resist it.' Scroll down for full court-hearing transcript . Denied: Mark David Chapman (left, in 2012)shot dead John Lennon (right, in September 1980) on December 8, 1980. He was denied parole for the eighth time at a court hearing last week . 'Incredible planning...incredible stalking': At the hearing last week, Chapman bragged about the plotting that went into Lennon's murder. Above, an excerpt of the court transcript . 'That bright light of fame': Chapman said he killed Lennon in order to gain notoriety after becoming suicidal. Above, another page of the court transcript . 'This wasn't a naive crime': Chapman was even able to convince his suspicious wife that he was only traveling to New York to write a book, and not kill Lennon. Above, a page of the court transcript that details the lead up to the shooting . The court also asked how he was able to financially handle traveling back and forth between Hawaii, where he lived with his wife, and New York where he followed Lennon. He says they sold a Norman Rockwell painting, and he was supposed to give the money to his father-in-law. Instead, he pocketed the money and used it for his trips to New York. Chapman went on to talk about the amount of thought that went into the shooting. He said it took 'incredible planning...incredible stalking' and that it was 'very well thought out'. He finally decided to carry out the crime in December, 1980, when he told his wife he was travelling to New York to get some space and write a children's book. She wasn't concerned at all because 'I was very convincing'. 'This wasn't a, you know, naive crime. It was serious, well thought out crime.'

Chapman also boasted about the media attention he continues to receive from the shooting, saying he's still approached for interviews. 'I haven't had an interview in 24 years and believe me they come. It's not my interest anymore at all... 'Believe me I am not interested in any press whatsoever at all, and there has been many times where I could have and very recently too. I won't mention names, but you would be surprised,' he said. Chapman fired five shots on December 8, 1980, outside the Dakota apartment where Lennon lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side, striking the ex-Beatle four times. Chapman was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. He will be eligible again for parole in two years.

The super-fit amateur athlete died in an air ambulance as he was being flown to hospital near Nice in the South of France, a coroner was told . Mr Evans's devastated girlfriend, Emma Thomson, 31, said they had been talking about getting married when the tragedy happened. The fatal crash happened in the medieval village of Tourrettes-sur-Loup, inland from Nice, at about 9.15am on June 23 last year. Mr Evans's father Nigel, a retired solicitor from Wymondham, Norfolk, attended his inquest in Norwich as Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake concluded it was accidental death. An eye-witness saw Mr Evans swerving repeatedly before he hit the rock. Rob Evans, pictured, was killed in a freak accident as he competed in a tough Iron Man triathlon on the French Riviera, an inquest heard . Mr Evans's devastated girlfriend, Emma Thomson, 31, said they had been talking about getting married when the tragedy happened . A report into the smash found that the talented sportsman may have been going too fast and simply lost control of his bike in the cycling section of the gruelling endurance event. The three winning triathletes held a minute's silence out of respect for Mr Evans on the podium after the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile cycle ride and 26.2-mile Iron Man race. Miss Thomson, 31, who lived with her Norfolk-born partner in London, has since raised more than £8,000 for the East Anglian Air Ambulance in his memory. He had registered to compete in a London triathlon and Amsterdam Marathon - and she took part in those in his place and raised funds for the air ambulance. Miss Thomson, who works as an accountant in London and was not at the inquest, said: 'An air ambulance was there in Rob's time of need in France and the EAAA has become a charity close to my heart. The Ironman Triathlon in Nice begins with a 2.64 mile swim, followed by a 111 mile bicycle ride and a standard 26 mile marathon run (file picture of the event) The fatal crash happened in the medieval village of Tourrettes-sur-Loup, inland from Nice, at about 9.15am on June 23 last year . 'Despite having a high-flying City job Rob was at heart a Norfolk boy and so it seems right that the charity should be EAAA.' She said they had been together eight years after meeting in London and were 'talking about marriage'. 'There are no words to describe how much Rob was loved and is missed by us all,' she added. 'When I remember Rob it is always a smiley, happy, laughing Rob that I think of. 'He was an amazing sportsman and triathlete and always gave 110 per cent in everything he took on. Rob Evans’s death was the latest tragedy to happen at a tough endurance event. An inquest last year heard how an ‘ultra-fit’ police officer died taking part in his first ever Ironman triathlon in New York. Andrew Naylor, from Anglesey in North Wales was pulled from the Hudson River during the swimming leg of the 140-mile event. Andrew Naylor was about an hour into the 2.4 mile swim, the first part of the race, which was due to followed by a 112 mile bike ride, and then a marathon over a 26.2mile course, when he fell ill . A post-mortem examination revealed the father-of-three drowned after a blocked artery caused him to have a heart attack. Earlier this year Robert Berry collapsed 40 yards from the finishing line of the London Marathon and died after suffering extreme heat stroke. The 42-year-old, of Reading, succumbed to hyperthermia where the body, unable to regulate its temperature, overheats and starts to shut down. An inquest heard the father of two had no underlying health problems. In October 2012, lawyer Daniel Bagshaw died yards from the finishing line of the Hong Kong triathlon having suffered from what was believed to have been a timebomb heart condition. The 27-year-old from Accrington, Lancashire, may have suffered an arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. He had previously completed a number of triathlons, marathons, half marathons, an amateur section of the Tour de France and had climbed Mount Everest. Coroner Michael Singleton said a post mortem examination was carried out in Hong Kong, which proved inconclusive and Mr Bagshaw’s death was possibly caused by an arrhythmia - an abnormal heart beat and put his death down to sudden adult death. In February a talented cross-country skier for Dartmouth College in the US died during an event in Vermont. Torin Tucker, 20, from Sun Valley, Idaho, was taking part in a 50 kilometer (31 mile) race at the Vermont Carnival in Craftsbury when he collapsed by the 43 kilometer mark. Attempts to resuscitate him failed and he died at the scene. 'And Rob had time for everyone. 'The thing I remember most about him is the sheer number of people who came up to me after he died and told me that he was their best friend.' Mr Evans was born in Norwich and attended Bignold school in the city before going on to Wymondham High School. He studied at Nottingham University and Imperial College, London. Mr Evans was working as a vice-president at Bank of America Merrill Lynch when he was killed.","Rob Evans died after falling off his bike during Iron Man event in South of France .

"By . Mark Teece . The NFL returns with a bang this Thursday as the Green Bay Packers head west to take on the reigning Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. The Packers will be looking to avenge the infamous ‘Fail Mary’ defeat in 2012, during which the replacement refs awarded the Seahawks a controversial game-winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter. The task is a formidable one for Aaron Rodgers and Co. The Seahawks boast an impressive home record, that's seen them taste defeat just once over the last two seasons at Century Link Field. However, the Packers head to the North West with both quarterback Rodgers and linebacker Clay Matthews fully fit following their injury struggles last season. The return of the pair, who are looked upon as the cornerstones of this Packers team, will no doubt boost Green Bay they look to improve on their 10-6 record over the Seahawks. Up first: The Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks will begin the season against the Green Bay Packers . Unlike many previous Super Bowl champions that have fallen victim to the rigours of free agency and the cap, the Seahawks have retained the vast majority of their stars. Defensive stars Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas penned new deals during the off-season and both will look to continue the formidable legacy of the 'legion of boom'. But it's not all been golden handshakes and smiles in Seattle, with running back Marshawn Lynch holding out for a few days. Coach Pete Carroll’s strength in depth has also been affected with Chris Clemons, Red Bryant and Clinton McDonald moving on. Russell Wilson has been nothing short of outstanding in pre-season and you can be certain that the Seahawks will be opening up the playbook more than we've been used to seeing. Infamous: The contest between these two teams in 2012 saw a controversial win for the Seahawks . Uproar: The Packers were left furious at the decision to award Seattle a game-winning touchdown . Battle: Seattle receiver Golden Tate and Green Bay's MD Jennings both fought over the same ball . Percy Harvin missed the vast majority of his debut season with the team, but with a full pre-season schedule behind him, the former Vikings receiver is set to torment opposition defences with his combination of speed and playmaking ability. Opposite Harvin, Jermaine Kearse has also been a standout during the summer months and should fill the void left by Golden Tate. But the Packers also boast an impressive receiving duo in Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson, who combined for 1747 yards and 12 touchdowns last term, and let’s not forget that their work was complimented by Jarrett Boykin, who contributed 681 yards and three touchdowns. As impressive as the statistics read, the Packers would be forgiven for straying away from the obvious threat thought the air, especially against a passing defense that was ranked No 1 overall, in favour of a punishing ground game. Eddie Lacy carried the team during Rodgers’ absence, amassing 1178 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns at 4.1 yards per carry last season. Lacy has the skills to take advantage of a Seahawks running defense that surrendered an average of 101.6 yards per game. Raring to go: Aaron Rodgers is back for Green Bay after missing a large part of last season through injury . Defensively, the Packers have somewhat addressed concerns within the secondary by re-signing cornerback Sam Shields, who performed at a consistently high level throughout last season. Along with Shields the Packers added first-round draft pick Ha-Ha Clinton Dix, who may be used in rotation to begin with, but if the college tape holds up, it'll be sooner rather than later before he becomes the starting safety. The question still remains for Packers fans - can this team stay healthy for the long haul, and recover from their recent play-off heartbreak? And for the ‘12th man’ in Seattle, is this the beginning of a dynasty? Can Carroll’s charge repeat their success from last season. It’s a tough ask - no team has successfully defended the Super Bowl since the New England Patriots in 2004 and 2005.

During the two minute video, they can be seen punching, kicking and throwing bar stools at the two victims while they lie helplessly on the floor. In a desperate attempt to protect Mr Reeves and Mr Smith, landlord Mr Birch grabbed a wooden pool cue and hit the thugs, who then fled. Violence flared at 11.30pm on February 13 after Quinlan and his friends walked into The Priory pub in Leek, Staffordshire. Despite the video being played in court, the trio all walked free after they were handed suspended prison terms. They had pleaded guilty to charges of affray at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court earlier this month. Quinlan, 30, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was sentenced to a six-month suspended term, Cooper, 20, of Wetley Rocks, Staffordshire, was given three months, also suspended, and O'Neill, 34, of Swindon, Wiltshire, was sentenced to eight months, also suspended. Mr Birch, whose wife Teena, 53, suffered a black eye in the violence, today hit out at the judge for not jailing the men. Mr Birch (left) said the fight was the worst he has ever seen in a pub and slammed the  suspended sentences given to Quinlan (right) and his two friends . Quinlan - seen as one of the top 30 national hunt jockeys in the country - got a six-month suspended sentence at Stoke on Trent Crown Court . Mr Birch said: 'I have no idea why they haven't been locked up, it was horrendous. It's as bad as it gets in a pub fight. 'I've never seen anything worse than that and we've been landlords for more than 35 years. 'This wasn't just your average pub fight, this was a sustained attack on two men who were down on the floor. 'I couldn't believe what was happening because they were on the ground and still being kicked. 'I've been working in pubs and clubs for more than 35 years and I've never seen anything so brutal and so unprovoked as this.' Shocking CCTV images show violence erupting with kicks and punches thrown after a row in the Priory pub . Locals rushed to try and break up the fight as Quinlan and his friends O'Neill and Cooper piled in to the melee . The CCTV shows one of the attackers pick up a bar stool before bringing it crashing down on one of the victims . He added: 'If I hadn't stepped in to try to break it up they could have killed someone.' His wife said: 'It's an insult that they have walked out of court effectively free men. 'The CCTV is absolutely horrific - the police officers said it was some of the worst they'd seen - and even the judge said it was disgraceful. 'If it hadn't been for Barry defending his regulars and himself it could have been much worse. 'The court heard they were responsible people with jobs, quite nice lads who just had too much to drink, but there's no excuse for what they did that night.' Quinlan is considered to be among the top 30 national hunt jockeys in the country and has won thousands in winnings in more than 50 professional races.","Jockey Sean Quinlan and friends started a fight in Staffordshire pub .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . A manhunt is underway in Idaho after an inmate escaped jail Tuesday morning by climbing over the fence. Cameras captured Nicholas Grove, 27, as he scaled the fence at the Payette County Jail's recreational yard then ran across the parking lot to freedom. 'And . within seconds, he was able to scale over and through that razor wire . and to the other side before the detention deputy was able to get to . him,' Payettee County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Andy Creech told KXAN. Authorities are hunting for inmate Nicholas Grove, 27, who scaled the fence at the Payette County Jail's recreational yard then ran to freedom . Nicholas Grove is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, carrying a concealed weapon without permit, and possession of burglary tools . A detention deputy spotted Grove from roughly 50 feet away through an open cafeteria door and chased after him, but was unable to reach him in time. It took Grove just 15 seconds to make it over the fence, including the razor wire top, and while he cut himself while doing it it's unclear if he was hurt badly. 10 years ago an inmate attempted to escape over the fence but was injured so badly in the climb he was easily stopped. Creech said authorities are still trying to understand how he was able to escape so easily. 'The Sheriff's Office is going to review the facility here and the recreation yard and see what we can do to from preventing this from happening again,' Creech said. Grove reportedly cut himself while climbing the fence's razor wire but was still able to flee before guards could stop him . KBOI2 reports Grove was last seen wearing a white tee shirt and black boxers. Grove has been incarcerated since Aug. 15.

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Two illegal immigrants face jail after . being found guilty of using a money transfer service to con customers . out of almost £50,000. Syed Bukhari, 25, and Siyed Asem, 58, ran the legitimate service from a corner shop they set up in Gloucester. But when customers entrusted them with their cash they skimmed hundreds . of pounds a time off the top of the sums. They also offered made up . exchange rates and pocketed the difference. All the while they were staying in the country illegally as 'overstayers' because their visas had expired. Immigrants: Siyed Asem, left, and Syed Bukhari, right, conned customers out of thousands of pounds while running a corner shop . The court heard how the two men set up the shop selling sweets and food as a way to make a living. But soon they began offering the entirely legal money transfer service to customers with relatives in the Indian sub-continent. In all, dozens of customers sending cash to relatives India and Bangladesh were fleeced by the crooks. The pair pleaded guilty at Gloucester crown court to the scam. Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud in that between January and March this year that he made false representations to customers, that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange. Asem admitted 12 similar charges. Lisa Hennessy, prosecuting, said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518. 'They ran a corner shop. One person paid over two sums of £5,000 - a total of £10,000 - and has lost it.' The two illegal immigrants admitted theft when they appeared at Gloucester Crown Court, pictured, and will be sentenced in August . Judge Jamie Tabor QC asked 'Where has all the money gone?' 'There is none left,' said Mrs Hennessy. 'We say their total criminal benefit was £51,000 but they have no assets left. 'The money has been used to keep the cashflow going in the shop. 'Everything seems to have been fine between last October and January when money was being transferred. But from January on it starts to fall apart and it is clear that the money has been used to keep things going and they have spent it. 'There doesn’t appear to be any money left. Fifty thousand pounds has gone in two and a half months.' Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Asem - who was assisted in court by an Urdu interpreter - has already been declared bankrupt. 'Both men are overstayers and both have been served with deportation papers,' she said. 'Mr Asem has significant health difficulties.' Judge Tabor said: 'That’s why he came to this country in the first place.' The judge said he would want to know how the two men were able to set up a corner shop if they were overstayers and had no legal status in this country. The judge remanded Bukhari in custody and Asem on bail for pre-sentence reports. But he warned them both to expect prison sentences when they return to court on August 10.","Victims were sending cash home to relatives in India and Bangladesh .

The more worrying statistic is that 82 per cent of dog owners who live in paralysis tick zones are not treating correctly to protect their dogs from the deadly paralysis tick, which is found along the coast in New South Wales, Queensland and in some parts of Victoria. Dog trainer and behaviour specialist, and Frontline Plus spokesperson, Amy Smith says, 'I see owners getting obsessive about their ‘furkids’ every day.

'It's important to remember that our pets are part of the family and we must be responsible for their well-being. But it’s our responsibility to know what we need to do and make sure it gets done when it comes to the basics of pet healthcare,' said Smith. 'The problem is that many owners just aren’t aware that they live in tick zones, but we know that paralysis ticks are deadly to dogs and cats. Sadly, a third of dog owners who live in a tick zone have had their dog, or a dog owned by someone they know, die from a paralysis tick'. Dog owners who live near the coast in tick hot-spots need to treat their dog every two weeks to effectively protect against paralysis ticks, while cat owners, every three weeks. Pet owners not living in paralysis tick zones should treat monthly to manage fleas and other types of ticks.And those who are in doubt, it is always good to check with your local veterinarian. 'Protecting your beloved pet from fleas and ticks is vital for its health and happiness. Once you’ve got the basics of caring for your pet sorted, then by all means, pamper them as much as you like!' said Smith.

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Police have launched an investigation after it emerged that Scots had been selling votes on eBay . Police have launched an investigation after it emerged that Scots have been trying to sell their referendum votes on eBay for as little as £1.04. Adverts offering the chance to buy a ballot slip for the September 18 vote were spotted by the Electoral Commission and quickly removed by the online auction site. One seller believed to be Chris O'Connor from Glasgow, who goes by the eBay username ‘chrisoc1986’ sold his vote for little over a pound. The listing read: ‘This is my very own unique piece of British History! It is my personal YES or NO vote for the upcoming Scottish Referendum in September. ‘I for one, do not give a flying monkeys about any of this. This could be the deciding vote. Who knows? ‘I am a hard working Scottish citizen with a house, a gorgeous wife and two beautiful kids who are my world. ‘This vote will not change anything in our lives so I have decided not to vote my opinion but instead.....

Another seller named 'catfez' put a £10 reserve on bidding for their vote, and claimed any money raised would be donated to charity. Police Scotland today confirmed officers were investigating the listings. A spokesman said: ‘Our policing arrangements for the referendum are well in hand and will be appropriate and proportionate. ‘Police Scotland's priority is to ensure public safety and security. We will respond appropriately to any issues which arise. ‘We are investigating these incidents and therefore cannot comment on the outcome of these incidents until all inquiries are concluded. ‘Where other incidents are reported they will be investigated and appropriate action taken.’ A spokesman for eBay said the company ‘does not permit’ the sale of certain items.

"By . Mark Prigg . Ebola could have a devastating effect on Africa's gorilla population, researchers have warned. They say the virus has already affected primates - and caused major changes in the way they reproduce. It has even broken up groups and forced infected animals out of their families. The disease can influence reproductive potential, immigration and social dynamics, researchers say . Ecologist Peter Walsh with the University of Cambridge watched 90 to 95 percent of the gorillas he was studying in a Congolese sanctuary disappear in two Ebola outbreaks in the early 2000s. He co-authored a scientific assessment that put the western lowland gorilla on the critically endangered list in 2007. “The combination of bushmeat hunting and disease was really slamming western gorillas,” he said. Walsh and his colleagues estimated that Ebola would wipe out 45 percent of the entire population in just one generation. Researcher studied animals affected by a previous outbreak in the Republic of Congo. The gorillas that were affected by an Ebola virus outbreak shows that disease can influence reproductive potential, immigration and social dynamics. Researchers say it highlights the need to develop complex models that integrate all the different impacts of a disease. This approach requires long-term monitoring of wildlife populations to understand the responses of populations to emerging changes in the environment, according to the Journal of Animal Ecology study. 'Along with the decrease in survival and in reproduction, Ebola outbreak perturbed social dynamics in gorilla populations,' said Dr. Pascaline Le Gouar of the University of Rennes, the senior author of the study. Scientists estimate that in a worst-case scenario, Ebola would wipe out 45 percent of the entire population in just one generation . 'During outbreak, transfers of both males and females between social units increased. 'Some adult females have been observed transferring to non-breeding groups, which is unusual in non-affected population. 'Although, six year after outbreak, most of vital rates returned to pre epidemic rate, recovery of the population is slow, especially because no compensatory immigration occurred after outbreak indicating that the neighboring populations might have been also affected,'","Virus has already infected primates .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A student who claims a former public school classmate tried to rape her has admitted she was drunk when she invited him back to her accommodation and got into bed with him. The 20-year-old woman had been drinking all evening when she went back to her halls of residence with currency trader Archie Read, also 20, and suggested he stay the night. Reed, who met his alleged victim years ago at a top independent school which cannot be identified for legal reasons, is accused of groping the woman as she slept. Former public schoolboy Archie Reed, 20, denies attempting to rape and the assault by penetration of his former class mate after they met at a pub in Warren Street in London where they drank a bottle of wine . A jury at the Old Bailey, in London, heard how he allegedly pulled off the woman’s pyjama bottoms and knickers and pounced on her while she was asleep next to him on October 8 last year. When she woke up, she allegedly felt Reed groping her and screamed for him to get out of her bedroom. She claimed he was so panicked after the incident that he fled her room without his trousers. The court heard how the woman had been to a drinks reception for top law firm Herbert Smith Freehills and had met Reed in a pub in Tottenham Court Road, central London, afterwards. ‘I was drunk - but I wasn’t blind drunk,’ she told the Old Bailey jury. ‘My memory of what happened is a bit patchy.’ By the time they stopped drinking Reed’s last Tube home had gone and the woman invited him back to her accommodation. As they walked back they held hands, had their arms around each other and she kissed him on the cheek. The Old Bailey heard that the alleged victim invited Reed, 20, pictured, back to her accommodation in London as it was late and the Tube had finished . ‘He had come to see me so it seemed only fair that he didn’t have to pay a huge amount of money for a cab home,’ she explained. They had been good friends and the woman said: ‘The reason I kissed him was because we had been talking about how much we had missed each other.’ When they got back to the room Reed stripped down to his boxer shorts and the student took off clothes. She said she was wearing shorts, and a vest top but did not have a bra on underneath. When they got into her bed she said Reed lay on his back and she turned with her back to him. ‘We were not spooning. He did not have his arm around me. I vividly remember this. ‘I didn’t mind him sleeping in my bed. It was meaningless. It wasn’t like we were cuddling. There was a boundary I didn’t expect him to cross.’ Reed claims the student kissed him, moved her bottom into his groin and lifted herself up so he could pull down her knickers. He claims he only touched the woman and stopped when she told him she did not want sex. ‘That not how it was,’ she sobbed. ‘We didn’t kiss in any way once we were back at my halls. ‘I didn’t kiss him. I didn’t spoon him. I didn’t insinuate I wanted to be spooned.’ She said she fell asleep and awoke to find Reed groping her and screamed for him to get out of her bedroom. ‘I was hysterical. I was screaming. I was in utter shock. I don’t think I could remember my own name at that point,’ she said. She said her shorts were off and Reed was panicking and grabbing his clothes. ‘He literally got off me, got his stuff and started swearing. He left. I don’t think he even had his trousers on. ‘He wasn’t upset. He just panicked. I have never seen him like that before.’ She admitted she called Reed after he sent her a text saying: ‘I didn’t do it all I promise x” ‘I wanted to hear his explanation as to what he had done. I felt something had happened. I knew something had happened but I didn’t know what. ‘I wanted to know what he had done to me.’ Later that morning she went to a chemist for the morning after pill and the police were called after she explained what had happened. Reed, a currency consultant at Smart Currency Business who lives in Hammersmith, west London, denies attempted rape and assault by penetration. The alleged victim told police that she awoke to find Reed, pictured, on top of her on October 8 last year . The young woman’s boyfriend said he did not know she had agreed to share a bed with Reed, but said it would not have upset him. Giving evidence, he said his girlfriend had sent him two texts that night, but did not mention whether she was still with Reed. He was unaware she had kissed Reed on the cheek, held his hand as they walked home, and wrapped their arms around each other during a stop at a supermarket. 'That night, did she tell you she told Archie he was able to sleep in her bed', asked Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, defending. 'She didn't tell me that', he replied. The Old Bailey heard that the alleged victim and Reed met up for the first time in a year following a school reunion in mid-September and agreed to meet again. However, the alleged victim denies kissing Reed . However, he said it would not have been a problem even if he had known. 'They had previously shared a bed or a sofa at a house party', he explained. 'I had my reservations about Archie, but they were friends for a number of years.' He said she had kissed friends on the cheek and held other boys' hands while at school and had held hands with Reed on occasions. The boyfriend, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said he received a call at 2.39am from his girlfriend shortly after the alleged attack. 'She was crying and hysterical, and I spent a few minutes calming her down', he said. 'I did say “what happened” and she said Archie came back and she said he could sleep on the floor and get up for work in the morning. 'She just said “I woke up and he was on top of me.”' Sallie Bennett-Jenkins defending Reed said the content of the alleged victims' text messages 'could have been misinterpreted' by her client as she would end her communications with a number of crosses and kisses . Archie Reed, right, tried to call and text his alleged victim after the incident to explain what had happened . He told the jury she did not seem drunk, but conceded he was unaware how much she had drunk that night. 'She was sobbing, she was obviously sniffing, and she was stuttering because she was crying as well as speaking', he said. 'She didn't seem drunk, she wasn't slurring her words.' He said he had been the first to mention the word 'rape' on that phone call. He said to her: 'I want you to be very clear, did he rape you’, and she replied: 'I don't know.' He added that Reed had tried to blame the incident on his girlfriend, when he called her later that night. 'He said it was my fault that it happened, and he said it was my fault I invited him back to my room,’ said the woman, who relayed it to her boyfriend. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Her career has spanned decades, survived fashions and struggled through a variety of public relations disasters. But last night hundreds of die-hard Madonna fans abandoned their Queen of Pop by marching out of London's Hyde Park during her MDNA concert - some branding it the worst they had ever seen. Even a sexy striptease on stage left fans cold- one simply stated: 'When Madonna has concerts in her 50s where she strips herself on stage, you know her career is as dead as myspace.' Scroll down for the video . Shot herself in the foot? Fans branded Madonna's Hyde Park gig the worst concert ever and hundreds walked out . Many fans decided they did not want to stick around to watch the finale as of the poor sound quality, terrible weather and Madonna's failure to perform more of her classic hits. One reviewer even said at one point Madonna screamed: 'We love you Poland', which if it was a joke fell flat on an already less than enthusiastic audience. Others said a 10.30pm curfew imposed by Westminster Council meant Madonna was forced to start her performance early, in broad daylight, which meant the elaborate staging was lost to some of the audience. Raunchy: Even a sensual performance by Madonna and her toyboy lover Brahim Zaibat failed to impress . Istanbul got the nipple, London got the fishnet strip: Madonna performs a strip tease during her concert . 'Worst gig ever': Even Madonna's energetic performances with a variety of props didn't win round many . Earlier her management admitted it had failed to sell all the tickets for the concert - Madonna's first in England for four years.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . Thousands of previously unpublished Boy Scouts of America files that detail suspected sexual abuse by employees and volunteers, including doctors, teachers and priests, have been posted online. The Los Angeles Times published the horrifying database with redacted victims' names on Tuesday, including material that was released earlier by an Oregon Supreme Court judge's ruling. The Boy Scouts kept the files - numbering almost 2,000 - for internal use for nearly a century, and they now reveal the systematic coverups by the organisation, which in turn led to more abuse. Cover ups: Portland attorney Kelly Clark examines some of the previously confidential documents created by the Boy Scouts of America concerning child sex abuse within the organization . The group has only conducted criminal background checks on volunteers since 2008 and finally, in 2010, the organization mandated any suspected abuse be reported to police. In an analysis of the records, which span from 1985 to 1991, the Times found that reports of abuse increased over time, which may be the result of greater awareness of child sexual abuse. The reports are not believed to account for all abuse, because the Scouts say an unknown number of files were destroyed over the years and not all victims report the crimes committed against them. The organization's inaction, and its efforts to keep allegations from police, parents and the public, allowed molesters to continue sexually abusing children, according to The Times. Horrors: Both Edgardo Ortiz, left, and Michael Pitz, right, had criminal records before working with the Scouts . Going public: Tom Stewart, who was abused between the ages of 8 and 18 while in the Scouts, poses with his old uniform outside the Boy Scout Camp Kilworth in Federal Way, Washington . The released files reveal that a Scouts committee chairman of four years, Samuel J. Becker, had a record of child molestation, had served prison time and was on probation for exposing himself. In another file, a Scoutmaster said he had reported suspicions of abuse about Scout Leader Gary L. Findlay of Illinois, but he was ignored by a superior. Findlay was later accused of abusing a 15-year-old in 1986, convicted of sexual abuse and expelled from the Scouts. A review by the newspaper found that . Scouting officials often urged offenders who admitted to carrying out . the abuse to quietly resign while helping others to cover their tracks. In about 80 per cent of cases that the . Scouts learned about, there is no record of officials reporting the . allegations to police, and in more than 100 of the cases, officials . actively sought to hide the abuse, The Times found. Sick example: In one of the files, assistant troop leader William Lazzareschi is kicked out of the Scouts after making a boy perform a sex act on him. There is no suggestion leaders called police . And the examples of what they got away with are horrifying. One case details Arthur W. Humphries, a Scout leader with 50 years of experience and numerous Scouting awards - yet also a serial child molester. Abuser: Assistant troop leader William Lazzareschi, whose file is pictured above . When he was arrested in 1984,  local Scouting official Jack Terwilliger claimed no one had known about Humpries' crimes, yet just six years earlier, Terwilliger had told officials to interview a boy who claimed Humphries had repeatedly performed oral sex on him. 'He then told me to do the same and I did,' the 12-year-old boy said in a 1978 statement. Officials did not report . Humphries' alleged crime to police and even gave him a glowing reference two years later when he applied for a post at a . national Scouting event, the Times found. Humphries continued to work with the Scouts . and abused at least five more boys before police stopped him in 1984 after acting on a tip. He was found guilty of abusing 20 Scouts, some as . young as eight, and was sentenced to 151 years behind bars. He is now deceased. In an earlier case, five Scouts detailed two rapes and other sex abuses by a scoutmaster in Pennsylvania and he promptly resigned, saying he had to travel for work. In response, a troop representative wrote: 'Good luck to you in your new position', adding that he was accepting the resignation 'with extreme regret'. In October, the Scouts unsealed 1,247 confidential files and the organisation offered an apology and counseling to victims. 'We have heard from victims of abuse . and are doing our very best to respond to each person with our utmost . care and sensitivity,' Scouting spokesman Deron Smith said at the time. Vindicated: Kerry Lewis, left, leans into his lawyer, Paul Mones, in a Portland, Oregon, courtroom after a jury found the Boy Scouts of America negligent for sexual abuse by an assistant Scoutmaster in the 1980s . Excuse: Officials previously justified their actions as necessary to protect the good name of the Boy Scouts . But in the years leading up to the files' release, victims said they were the ones who were blamed. At a trial in 2010, an Oregon man alleged that the Scout organisation allowed troop leader Timur Dykes to continue working after he admitted molesting 17 boys in the early 1980s. In a shocking move at the hearing, regional Scouts official Eugene Grant blamed parents for letting their sons go to the man's apartment for merit badge work and sleepovers. 'His parents should have known better,' Grant said of one victim. 'I think it's criminal.' But the jury rejected that assertion, finding the Scouts liable for nearly $20 million in damages. Most of the files opened after 1991 haven't been released. Various pending lawsuits were seeking those files. SHOCKING STORIES OF ABUSE FROM FORMER BOY SCOUTS . Tom and Matt Stewart by be . middle-aged men now, but the abuse they suffered for a decade as Boy . Scouts still haunts them to this day. 'I still have some nightmares to this day of abuse,' said Tom Stewart, pictured, who says the abuse went on from ages 8-18. The . brothers say the Boy Scouts of America turned their backs on them when . they needed support the most, as they were arrested at their home, . during camping trips and elsewhere. They settled out-of-court after suing the Boy Scouts in 2003. In . another shocking case, a scoutmaster admitted to raping a 17-year-old . boy on a camping trip and otherwise sexually molesting two other boys; . the victims corroborated his confession. But no charges were ever filed. The . man was let off with a warning that should he be found with young men . in the future, he was subject to immediate incarceration at the state . prison. The man 'was asked . to leave the parish, and if he was caught around or near any boy or . youth organization, he would be sent to state prison immediately,' a . Scouting executive wrote to national headquarters. 'We are indeed sorry . that Scouting was involved.' In Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in August 1962, a married 25-year-old steel mill worker with a high school education pleaded guilty to 'serious morals' violations involving Scouts. The Scouting executive who served as both mayor and police chief made sure of one thing: The Scouting name was never brought up. It went beyond the mayor to a three-judge panel, who also deemed it important to keep the Scouts' names out of the press. 'No mention of Scouting was involved in the case in as much as two of the three judges who pronounced sentence are members of our Executive Board,' the Scouts executive wrote to the national personnel division. In August 1966, a boy at an unknown Scout camp reported he was molested by a rifle instructor. The camp director didn't believe the boy so he sent the Scout back out onto the rifle range and hid nearby to see what would happen. He saw the instructor molest the boy twice, according to the camp director's memo. Afterwards, the camp director held a meeting with the local scoutmaster. They were joined by the boys' parents. The meeting closed with all parties agreeing that the instructor would be 'quietly dismissed,' and to 'keep our knowledge private.'","The Los Angeles Times published the shocking database on Tuesday .
