"A book shop has come up with a novel way to sell second-hand books - by dispensing them at random from a vintage vending machine. In exchange for a $2 coin, the ‘Biblio-Mat’ gives curious book lovers a novel picked at random at quirky bookstore the Monkey’s Paw in Toronto, Canada. The creative invention holds books that are at least 25-years-old and has proved popular among customers who are left 'amused and mystified' by their purchase surprise. Scroll down for video . The popular 'Biblio-Mat' book vending machine dispenses a random book, that is at least 25-years-old, in exchange for a $2 coin . Store owner Stephen Fowler, 48, said: ‘Most people laugh when they first see it and they're surprised by the intense mechanical sound that it makes. ‘The Biblio-Mat is the ultimate expression of the serendipity that people experience in a second-hand bookshop. ‘You might like what you get, or you might not; but for a two-dollar coin, it's a pretty cheap thrill. Serendipity in store: The machine has an unexpected variety of old books that leaves some 'mystified' or 'amused' by what book they get . Quirky invention: The machine is 'the ultimate expression of the serendipity,' store owner Stephen Fowler says . ‘In our shop, we always try to startle . browsers with the oddest and most unexpected variety of old books so the . idea of a book randomiser was a natural extension of the store's . philosophy.’ It all started when Mr Fowler had to come up with a clever merchandising ploy for a community sidewalk sale. He had suggested a cardboard box hiding an assistant handing out books through a flap but his friend and professional designer Craig Small shunned the idea. Mr Small envisioned the machine and took three months to have it ready in time for the community sale in late October. The machine has proved popular and since the sale, some 60 people each weekend been buying random books from the novel invention. Mr Fowler said: ‘Sometimes people laugh when the see the title they've received or just look mystified. ‘If a person knew exactly what book he was looking for, he'd be better off ordering it on Amazon. ‘To begin with I was just going to call it the Book Randomiser but my wife convinced me to call it something a bit more quaint which is why we ended up calling it Biblio-Mat.’ Inspiration: The invention came about after Mr Fowler had to come up with a merchandising ploy for a community sidewalk sale at his second-hand bookstore (pictured)","The 'Biblio-Mat' dispenses a random book, at least 25-years-old, for $2 .

'This is it. No more. Half a dozen is plenty for us,' Michelle Seals said on Thursday. Each of the quintuplets born in Texas on Tuesday are in good health.

"Football Association general secretary Alex Horne says the total ban on any gambling on football by players or coaches that comes into force on Friday will help the fight against match-fixing. Players, managers, club employees and match officials are now not allowed to place any bet on any football-related matter worldwide. Horne says the ban will remove any grey areas surrounding betting on football - previously players were only banned from betting on a competition with which their club was involved. Confident: FA general secretary Alex Horne believes a new ban on all gambling among football players and staff will help stop match-fixing . Trouble: Tottenham winger Andros Townsend (left) was banned for a month for gambling on football . Last season saw a number of arrests and prosecutions for match-fixing related offences in semi-professional English football, and Horne believes the new rules will target that threat. Horne said: 'We are really proud of the integrity of the game in this country and it is really important that people trust the integrity of what is happening on the pitch. 'There have been some cases and prosecutions [for match-fixing] in this country and we don't want to see it. 'We want to keep our message as simple as possible - and it cannot be more simple that as a player you cannot bet at all on football.' The ban also covers events such as manager appointments and player transfers, and applies to all forms of betting, and players are not allowed to instruct anyone else to place any bet on their behalf. It will cover the top eight tiers of English football, going down to the Isthmian League. A new educational drive will see new videos being produced to drive home the message. These include one from the former Italian player and now Aston Villa academy coach Simone Farina, who won a FIFA award after he called in the police in 2011 after being offered 200,000 euros to influence the outcome of an Italian Cup game that his club at the time, Gubbio 1910, was involved in. Gone: Ronnie Moore was sacked by Tranmere Rovers last season after breaching his contract by betting . Other videos include one making clear that it is also banned to pass on inside information, such as on injuries or transfers, to other people including family or friends. The videos will be distributed to players and clubs by the Professional Footballers' Association, and will also be shown to managers and club captains at pre-season briefings. The FA also believe the betting ban will be so easy to understand that it will cut out any incidents of players being sanctioned for unwittingly breaching rules. Tottenham's England winger Andros Townsend was suspended for a month in 2013 for breaching the rules about betting on a competition with which he was involved, and missed the England under-21 championship in Israel. Darren Bailey, the FA's director of football governance and regulation, added: 'This betting rule change to encompass all aspects of world football provides a simple, clear and straightforward message to all participants concerned, on where the line is drawn.'","Total ban stops players, managers, club employees and match officials betting on any football-related matter worldwide .

"Tim Hauser, the founder and singer of the Grammy-winning vocal troupe The Manhattan Transfer, died Thursday from cardiac arrest, band representative JoAnn Geffen said Friday. He was 72. Hauser founded Manhattan Transfer, who released their debut album in the early 1970s and launched hits such as 'Operator' and 'The Boy from New York City.' They went on to win multiple pop and jazz Grammy Awards. Their critically acclaimed album, 1985's 'Vocalese,' earned a whopping 12 Grammy nominations. Alan Paul, Janis Siegel and Cheryl Bentyne — who joined in 1978 and replaced Laurel Masse — rounded out the foursome. Remembered: Tim Hauser, right, founder of The Manhattan Transfer, passed away Thursday. He is seen in 2008 with other members of the group . Crooner: Hauser (far right), seen with members Alan Paul and Janis Siegel, won multiple Grammys with The Manhattan Transfer . 'It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of Tim Hauser’s passing with you all...,' they said in a statement. 'As many of you know, Tim was the visionary behind The Manhattan Transfer. We spent more than 40 years together singing and making music, traveling the world, and sharing so many special moments throughout our lives... 'It's incomprehensible to think of this world without him. We join his loving wife, Barb, his beautiful children, his family, and the rest of the world in mourning the loss of our dear friend and partner in song. 'Love, Janis, Cheryl and Alan.' Hauser first formed Manhattan Transfer in 1969 with Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, Gene Pistilli and Pat Rosali. They disbanded and Hauser met some of the band's new members as a taxi driver in New York City. He met a conga player while driving who introduced him to Siegel and he also met Masse while driving. Hauser once described a 1956 experience to The Asbury Park Press in which 'This little kid comes over to me with makeup in his hand and it was Frankie Lymon. He asked, ""Do you know where the dressing rooms are?"" and I did, because I used to go to the Boy Scout jamborees that were held at Convention Hall.' '[Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers] sang 'I Promise to Remember' a cappella and I was maybe 18 inches from them if not less sitting there — I could literally reach out and touch them,' he also told the newspaper. 'I swear that was my turning point. That was God's way of saying, 'Here's your gig, son and if you don't get it, it's not my fault.' Hauser was born in Troy, New York. He is survived by his wife Barb Sennet Hauser, his son Basie and his daughter Lily. Manhattan Transfer will continue their upcoming tour despite Hauser's death.

"These extraordinary photographs appear to show a tree hovering in the air after despite having had a section cut out of its trunk.

Floating: This extraordinary optical illusion was created by a pair of German graphic designers . Write caption here . The pair had the idea after being commissioned by clients to spray-paint electricity transformer stations in order to make them blend in to the surrounding environment. They found an appropriate tree by the side of the road, and wrapped part of its trunk in plastic sheeting. The artists then painted a landscape on the plastic designed to imitate the countryside around it perfectly. This gives the illusion that the tree is completely see-through. Work in progress: The artists first applied the plastic sheeting before painting the landscape with spray paint . Close-up: The artwork is somewhat less convincing when viewed from an alternative angle . Mr Schuster explained that the experiment was inspired by their work for design firm Art-EFX, where they are used to making objects camouflaged in their surroundings. 'The majority of customers like the transformer stations hidden so we paint the background on the object,' he said. 'Last December just for fun - we had the idea on our minds and just wanted to try it out - we'd never expected it to cross the world through the internet like this, the feedback is colossal.

"A Channel 7 tennis commentator has caused outrage at the Australian Open after asking Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard to ‘twirl’ on live TV. The 20-year-old was stunned as she was asked by commentator Ian Cohen  during her post-match interview: ‘Can you give us a twirl?’. Bouchard had just won an impressive 6-0, 6-3 match against Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands in just 54 minutes at Melbourne Park. Channel 7 distanced themselves from the interview when contacted by Daily Mail Australia, saying that Cohen was 'working For Tennis Australia'.

The shocked Canadian laughed, twirled and then covered her face with her hands before waving at the cheering audience. Cohen made the request for a twirl after he noticed Bouchard had commented about Serena William’s Australian Open outfit on Twitter. ‘Last night you tweeted that you loved Serena’s outfit. Obviously the fluoro is working for you girls at the moment. She was kind enough to give us a twirl, can you give us a twirl and tell us about your outfit,’ he said. After twirling, Bouchard awkwardly noted: 'I mean I have to say I think Serena's outfit is the best, even better than mine, I have to give her that.’ Last year Bouchard, when was asked at the Australian Open who her dream date was, she replied: 'Justin Bieber'.

"Fishermen have caught 25 dolphins from a pod of more than 250 being held captive on the coast of Japan, it is claimed.

The brutal selection follows an international outcry, with thousands of people having taken to social networking sites during the past 24 hours to express their anger and disgust at the process. Local fisherman and dolphin trainers arrived at a cove in the village of Taiji, on the south-west coast of Japan, shortly after 7am today, according to militant environmental group Sea Shepherd. The dolphins had already been forced to endure an agonising 19-hour wait - with eye-witnesses reporting that the animals could be seen 'thrashing around' in the cramped cove.

Sad: The body of dolphin believed to have died during the selection process is transferred to a butcher's house . Horrific scene: If the remaining dolphins that escape captivity are not killed, they will be 'driven' back to the open ocean by 'banger boats' that force them to travel out to sea using long poles attached to the boat's sides .

"Two young boys who fell from an inflatable bounce house as it was swept skyward by gusty winds remained hospitalized in stable condition Wednesday, one in a medically induced coma with a head injury, according to police. A girl, age 10, and the boys, ages 5 and 6, were playing in the 10-by-10-foot roofless nylon playhouse at a South Glens Falls, New York, townhouse community Monday afternoon when the 38-pound Little Tikes toy product broke loose from plastic anchoring stakes, local police said. Commercial bounce houses rented for parties and other events are made of heavy vinyl, weigh 200 to 250 pounds and are secured by 18-inch steel stakes. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: This May 13, 2014 photo provided by the South Glens Fall Police Department, shows a deflated bounce house that three children were playing in on Monday when it broke loose from plastic anchoring stakes and was swept skyward by gusty winds . The girl fell out immediately and suffered minor scrapes, but the boys didn't tumble out until the toy was 15 feet in the air. Police Chief Kevin Judd told the Glens Falls Post Star that one boy hit a parked car and then the pavement as he fell and suffered a serious head injury. The other suffered two broken arms, a broken jaw, broken facial orbital bone and possible ruptured spleen. The boys, who live in neighboring apartments nearby wher ethe incident happened, were airlifted to Albany Medical Center. The chief said an investigation was continuing but no charges were likely to be filed. He called what happened a 'tragic accident.' There have been other accidents involving windblown bounce houses. In Scottsdale, Arizona, a bounce house outside a McDonald's restaurant was pushed into traffic by a gust of wind in March 2012. No injuries were reported. Nightmarish: This dramatic photo shows an inflatable bounce house that blew to 50 feet in the air before dumping out two boys from around 15 feet and leaving them seriously injured . Way up: The children had long since fallen out when they shocking photos were taken. The bouncy house flew an estimated 50 high and made it past a stretch of woods before finally drifting back to earth and landing behind a local school . In June 2011, strong winds tumbled . three bounce houses with children inside them at a youth soccer . tournament in Oceanside. Minor injuries were reported. Witnesses . watched in horror as the inflatable bounce house was swept into the air . before dumping the boys back on the ground from 15 feet up. In . the nightmarish scene, the children were playing in the carnival staple . when winds spun the bounce house around as if in a tornado before . lifting it up. The boys were hospitalized Monday afternoon with serious injuries. 'It was like a horror movie,' complex resident Taylor Seymour told the Post-Star. 'It just kept going up and up. It cleared our building and the trees.' It was on Seymour's car that one of the children landed. The structure went on to blow a full 50 feet into the air and one witness snapped a shocking picture of it hovering above. Dangerous: The structure was similar to the one pictured and was owned by a resident of the apartment complex in South Glens Falls, New York where the incident occurred. A third child, a 10-year-old little girl, manged to escape just as the structure took off and received only minor injuries . The mother of the little girl agreed. 'My older daughters witnessed it and said it was just horrible,' she said, without giving her name. 'A big gust of wind just blew it right off the ground with the kids in it. It's just sickening.' 'The witnesses said it was a sudden burst of wind and it just lifted off the ground,' Patrolman David Gifford told the Post-Star. 'It was just a freak accident.' Gifford and the little girl's mother said the bounce house was tethered to the ground with stakes but that it was blown loose. The structure was owned by a resident of the complex. It landed behind a nearby school after clearing a stretch of woods. The owner told the Post-Star that she'd set up the Little Tikes brand toy several times in the two years she'd owned it. The mother of the lucky little girl, at least, wasn't not pointing fingers anyway. 'I don't think people know that this can happen when it's windy,' she said.","Two boys aged 5 and 6 were tossed out of the carnival staple and seriously injured, with one incurring a traumatic head injury .

"The parents of a two-year-old girl with a rare blood disorder have urged the Government to pay for a ‘miracle drug’ to keep her alive. Indie Smith is one of just 140 people in the UK who suffer from the disease – for which only one effective and safe treatment has been found, the drug Soliris. But it costs up to £250,000 a year per patient. Indie was among a handful of patients prescribed Soliris on a trial basis. But the trial is due to end and the drug is not available on the NHS. Clare Smith and husband Gavin are fighting to secure funding for a new treatment, Soliris, for their daughter Indie, aged two, who has a rare kidney cancer . A quarter of all people with Indie’s condition – atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) – die shortly after diagnosis. Indie’s parents, Clare, 36, and heating engineer Gavin, 40, of Chelmsford, Essex, were amazed by her rapid improvement on Soliris. ‘Within two days of the first dose she started to become normal again,’ Clare said. ‘Before that, she wasn’t with us at all. Soliris is expensive but it is a miracle drug because what it’s done for Indie is amazing.’ Indie responded to treatment with Soliris (eculizumab) within two days of receiving the first dose during a clinical trial . Clare and Gavin, who also have three sons, now fear for her future when the Soliris trial – funded by the drug’s American manufacturers – comes to an end in October. Last year the Advisory Group for National Specialised Services (AGNSS), a committee of experts which advises Ministers, recommended the drug be approved for use in the UK. But the Government instead referred the matter to the National Institute for Health and Clinic Excellence (NICE), which has no procedures to evaluate it. Tim Goodship, Professor of Renal Medicine at Newcastle University, said: ‘I think Ministers’ primary concern is its affordability.’ A body called NHS Specialised Services commissions drugs for rare conditions. The aim is to protect the budgets of hospitals whose finances would come under severe strain if they were required to fund expensive treatments for small numbers of patients out of their own resources. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We need to make sure NHS resources are used wisely.’","Indie Smith responded to trial drug Soliris within two days of treatment .

"Two rhino poachers have been shot dead at an Indian wildlife sanctuary. The men were caught after Indian Forest rangers heard them trying to shoot the animals in Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Northeastern India. The pair were killed after a gun fight between the poachers and forest rangers. Killed: A dead rhino, who was killed by heavy exchange of fire between a group of five poachers and forest guards is seen at Sundari Camp at Kaziranga National Park . Shot dead: The two men were killed after a gun fight between the poachers and forest rangers. Rhinos, left in file photo,  are killed for their horn, which are extremely valuable and rival their price in gold . Rhinos are killed for their horn, which are extremely valuable and rival their price in gold. Officials said that four poachers had entered the park had shot at a rhino. The shot, which missed its target, alerted forest guards who rushed to the spot. 'A fierce encounter took place between the two sides in which two of the poachers were killed,' park warden N.K. Vasu told AFP, adding that a rifle had been recovered. Targets: Forest guards examining a dead rhino killed by poachers at the famous Kaziranga National Park. Poachers killed 21 rhinos in the park last year . Epidemic: Poachers killed a rhino and took away the horn at Burhapahar Range in Kaziranga National Park on January 28 . Problem: Last week forest rangers engaged in a gun battle with poachers for more than seven hours, but they failed to prevent the killing of another rhino whose valuable horn was gouged out . India's location and array of wildlife makes it particularly susceptible to poachers who can easily export the goods. The horns are than usually smuggled to neighboring China, where it is used as medicine and jewellery. Poachers killed 21 rhinos in Kaziranga National Park last year. An estimated 2,500 out of the world's 3,000 one-horned rhinos live in Kaziranga. Last week forest rangers engaged in a gun battle with poachers for more than seven hours, but they failed to prevent the killing of another rhino whose valuable horn was gouged out. An operation is currently ongoing in the nearby Karbi Anglong hills, in which several poachers have been arrested. The poachers are thought to have links with traders in Nagaland and Burma.","Two men killed after a gun fight between the poachers and forest rangers .

"Rumours are currently flying as to what Tesla’s big announcement, scheduled for later today, will reveal. Last week, the car maker's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the company would unveil ‘the D’ and ‘something else’ on 9 October - although a time wasn't given. One of the announcements is thought to be an upgrade to existing Tesla cars such as driver assist technology, while the other could be a new sports car akin to a Bugatti. Here comes 'the D': California-based Tesla is set to make two major announcements today. Rumours claim they may reveal a sports car that goes 0-60 in three seconds. The development was teased by chief executive Elon Musk on Twitter last week (pictured) In an interview with Aspen Institute’s Walter Isaacson, Musk revealed that one of the features would be something current Tesla owners could just ‘turn on’, reported Vanity Fair. He also confirmed that guesses on the internet were 'directionally correct, but the magnitude is not appreciated yet.' Elon Musk has indicated that one of the announcements might be something existing Tesla users can just ‘turn on’. This may indicate he will reveal driver assists, such as a system to monitor your speed or lane driving assists. This may also be a change in the technology that gives the Tesla greater range. Other rumours suggest they will release an electric supercar that can go 0-60 in three seconds, rivalling other cars like the Bugatti Veyron. This indicates it is a planned upgrade to modern Tesla cars, or perhaps something they can purchase as an addition. Theories about what the other announcement might be range from a self-driving car, a Tesla with greater range or an all-wheel drive vehicle. However according to website Electrek, the announcement will be a new sports car called the P85D that can go from 0 to 60 in less than three seconds. This would be a new ‘supersport’ version of the current Tesla Model S. They claim a source has revealed ‘the D’ will be a supercar, which will be able to compete with other high-end vehicles like Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Ferraris. And Electrek is banking its money on the other announcement being autonomous driving - possibly a form of driver assist. Speculation suggests this may be technology that helps regular a car’s speed, and also warn it of any dangers when moving into another lane. Last week on Twitter Musk said: ‘About time to unveil the D and something else.’ But when internet commenters revealed that ‘the D’ had some rather rude connotations, Musk let slip some more information. ‘I love the Internet. Comments had me literally ROFL. No, it wasn’t intentional. Glad I didn’t mention the other letter!’ However, according to website Electrek, the announcement will be a new sports car called the P85D that  will be able to compete with other high-end vehicles like Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Ferraris.. This would be a new ‘supersport’ version of the current Tesla Model S, and separate to the existing Tesla Roadster (shown) Pictured is a black 2010 Bugatti Veyron on a rural road in England. The Bugatti Veyron has a top speed of 252.97mph (407.12km/h). It was named Top Gear's Car of the Decade from 2000 to 2009 . Based on Musk's next tweet (shown) some have suggested the announcement may be a driver-assisted version of one of Tesla's previous cars, such as the Model S. In the image, the teased car looks to be similar to the Model S. Earlier this year Tesla revealed the 'Model 3' mainstream electric car . Some have suggested the other letter might be a ‘P’, although what either could stand for is unknown. Currently, Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes. Tesla recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set up about 200 more around the world, including Japan, by the end of the year. Earlier this year, Tesla unveiled the Model 3 - a mainstream version of its other electric vehicles priced around £30,000 in the UK and $35,000 in the US. At the time Musk unveiled his displeasure at being unable to call it the ‘Model E’ due to legal action from Ford. The previous two Tesla cars are called the Model S and the Model X, and Musk apparently wanted to spell out the word ‘sex’ with all three. 'We were going to call it model E for a while and then Ford sued us saying it wanted to use the Model E,’ Musk told Auto Express at the time. ‘I thought this is crazy, Ford’s trying to kill sex! So we’ll have to think of another name.’ Exactly what the letter 'D' for the new announcement is trying to spell if anything, though, remains to be seen.","California-based Tesla is set to make two major announcements today .

"For centuries people in the Middle Ages lived in fear of vampires. And now a telling sign of the precautionary measures they took against the mythical creatures has been found in northwestern Poland. The grave of the suspected terror was found in Kamien Pomorski and has all the markings of a vampire burial. The skeleton of a suspected vampire has been found in the town of Kamien Pomorski in northwester Poland. The burial is thought to date back to the 16th century, a time when much of central Europe was fearful of vampires rising from the dead and 'sucking their blood' The body is believed to date back to the 16th century, although the absence of personal effects makes it difficult to date. It was found during a dig in the cemetery next to the town church. Its features are reminiscent of similar vampire burials that have been found in the past. The most obvious sign of this being a vampire burial was the stake through its leg. Many suspected vampires are found nailed or staked to the ground to prevent them rising from the ground. ‘Initially we thought he had suffered a leg wound,’ dig leader Slawomir Gorka told Kamienskie. ‘But from sifting through the earth underneath, we realised there was a hole likely made from a puncture.' The mouth was also found without its . teeth with a piece of brick in their place, which supposedly stopped the . vampire rising and sinking its teeth into victims. The mouth of the burial was also found with a small bit of brick rubble in it, which would have been intended to stop the vampire sinking its teeth into people if it did rise from the dead . The skeleton was found with a stake through its leg, which would have been intended to stop the vampire rising from the grave, said dig leader Slawomir Gorka . Finding vampire burials like this is not uncommon, with several discovered in Poland over the last few years. It is thought that burials of this sort were common in the Kamien Pomorski area from the 13th to 17th century. According to some beliefs, people who were considered bad during their lifetimes might turn into vampires after death unless stabbed in the chest with an iron or wooden rod before being buried. These vampires were often intellectuals, aristocrats and clerics. Upon their death - or even before - locals would take measures to ensure that the suspected vampires did not terrorise their communities by driving stakes through parts of their bodies or removing the teeth from their mouth. Finding vampire burials is not uncommon, with several discovered in Poland over the last few years. It is thought that burials of this sort were common in the Kamien Pomorski (marked) area from the 13th to 17th century . The belief in vampires was widespread throughout Bulgaria and other parts of central Europe throughout the Middle Ages. The word vampire is derived from the original Slavic term opyrb or opir which later appears as vipir, vepir, or vapir. Drunkards, thieves and murderers were all believed to be likely candidates to become vampires. John van Eyssen prepares to drive a wooden stake through the heart of a vampire. The scene was in 1958's 'Horror of Dracula' Appearing . completely normal, they would arrive at a town and live amongst the . people often even marrying and fathering children. But at night they . would wander the countryside in search of blood. These types of vampires could be destroyed with a stake through the heart. One account maintains that a . vampire was the soul of an outlaw who died in the mountains or forest or . along a country road, and whose corpse is eaten by crows, wolves, or . some other such scavengers. Because . such a soul is not permitted to enter heaven or hell it remains on . earth haunting the place where he was killed strangling and drinking the . blood of anyone who comes by. Another . account states a person who died a violent, unnatural death or whose . corpse was jumped over by a cat before burial, can become a vampire. In . such cases during the first 40 days after burial, the bones turn to . gelatin and the vampire performs mischief at night  - releasing animals . from their pens, scattering house hold items, and suffocating people. During . the first forty days it can be destroyed by a Vampiridzhija - a . professional vampire hunter capable of seeing them - or alternatively . devoured by a wolf. However if not destroyed in this time period the Vampire would develop a skeleton and becomes even more fierce.","Archaeologists in northwestern Poland have a found a suspected vampire .

"This is the chilling moment an Australian teenager who raped and strangled his neighbour calmly carried her body out of the building in a suitcase before dumping it in a canal. Today Daniel Stani-Reginald, now 21, was sentenced 45 years in jail for killing Tosha Thakkar, 24, in Sydney. He was ‘studying how to become a serial killer,’ and had planned his crime for months in advance as part of his ‘education’, a Sydney court heard. Scroll down for video . Chilling: Daniel Stani-Reginald, who raped and strangled his neighbour Tosha Thakkar, 24, calmly carries her body out of the building in a suitcase before dumping it in a canal . Sentencing him to a maximum 45 year jail term on Friday, Justice Derek Price said Stani-Reginald had shown no capacity for empathy or any remorse for the cruel and premeditated crime. 'There is documented evidence he had been planning similar offences for a period of years, gradually becoming more focused,' Justice Price said as he set a non-parole period of 30 years. 'Notwithstanding her efforts to survive, the offender strangled her, which was extremely cruel,' Justice Price said. 'The last minutes of her life must have been horrifying. This was a terrible way for the deceased to die.' Jailed: Today Daniel Stani-Reginald, now 21, was sentenced 45 years in jail for killing Tosha Thakkar, 24, in Sydney . In the weeks leading up to the 2011 murder, Stani-Reginald had visited 9,500 online articles and websites dedicated to serial killers and rapists. Stani-Reginald has pleaded guilty to raping and strangling the accountancy student, and is due to be sentenced by Sydney Supreme Court. Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC today urged a judge to impose a life sentence on Stani-Reginald, saying he is capable of seeking notoriety as a serial killer, NineNewsNational reports. Instead of attending university or forging a career, Stani-Reginald 'made a deliberate decision to school himself on how to become a serial rapist and murderer,' Mr Tedeschi said. Miss Thakkar, originally from Gujarat, western India, had moved to Australia two years earlier to take a post-graduate in accounting at the city's Southern Cross University. The brutal killing took place in the home of Ms Thakkar, who lived in the same house as Stani-Reginald in the Sydney suburb of Croydon, on March 9, 2011. Stani-Reginald had spent the morning 'studying' the sentences of serial killers and watching pornography focusing on the 'degradation of Indian women,' the court heard. Macabre education: In the months leading up to the 2011 murder of Miss Thakkar, Daniel Stani-Reginald, then 19, visited thousands of websites dedicated to serial killers and rapists . Brutal killing: Stani-Reginald, now 21, attacked accountancy student Miss Thakkar, stuffed her dismembered body into a suitcase and dumped it in a canal before he went home to read 'Beginnings of a Serial Killer' After the murder, Stani-Reginald jumped in a cab and transported Miss Thakkar's dismembered body, which he had put in a suitcase, to a canal at Meadowbank, Sydney where it was found two days later. After dumping the body, he visited a shopping centre before returning home to continue his morbid studies and even spoke to Miss Thakkar's boyfriend as police investigated her disappearance. Stani-Reginald was not found to have been under any influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the murder and has not shown remorse, Mr Tedeschi said, . 'There's not the slightest suggestion he was horrified by what he had done. The community would be justifiably aggrieved if he were to receive a sentence less than life imprisonment,"" Mr Tedeschi said. The sentence hearing continues.","Daniel Stani-Reginald, now 21, raped and killed Tosha Thakkar, 24, in 2011 .

Critics said the findings showed a ‘huge gap’ in pay levels between boardrooms and ordinary workers. Most British staff have seen their pay lag behind inflation since the financial crash. Wages are expected to rise in real terms this year as the economy picks up – but the increase comes after years of stagnant pay. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show there has been no real terms pay increase in the UK for ten years. The basic salary for most FTSE 100 directors rose last year by 2.5 per cent – just below the 2.8 per cent level of inflation at the time, the IDS report said. But they benefited from a ‘significant boost’ in bonuses and other rewards. Most executives receive shares in their company – on top of a cash bonus – when hitting performance targets. Last year the number of such long-term share schemes paying out rose by 44 per cent. Top directors also enjoyed a 12 per cent rise in bonuses. The findings cover chief executives, finance directors and any executive chairman sitting on FTSE100 company boards. Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS report, said: ‘FTSE100 directors have seen their total earnings jump sharply in the last year, fuelled by a rise in the value of share-based awards. Bonus payments have also recovered strongly following a downturn last year.’ He added that long-term share schemes also ‘give a significant boost to directors’ earnings’. FTSE100 chief executives – who are generally the highest paid in any organisation – receive an average basic salary of £832,000 and an average bonus of £1million. They also benefit from share payouts of around £2million. Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, has faced outrage from investors after his total pay package soared from £17.5million to £30million last year . Since 2000, the average pay for chief executives has increased almost four-fold, the report says, while average wages have risen by just 48 per cent. Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, has faced outrage from investors after his total pay package soared from £17.5million to £30million last year, bolstered by lucrative share schemes. One third of the company’s shareholders refused to back the rewards, which were criticised as ‘lavish’. The taxman has ramped up prosecutions against individuals suspected of tax dodging – but is still accused of letting corporate giants off the hook. The number of court cases HMRC brought for illegal tax evasion rose last year by almost a third – from 612 to 795 – data from Thomson Reuters shows today. The figure is a significant jump from the 302 cases it won in 2011/12. Each case can, however, take months to process, so it is not known how many of the recent cases were successful. HMRC will be granted highly controversial powers that will allow it to raid bank accounts directly in an effort to close Britain’s £35billion annual tax gap. But a history of mistakes and blunders have led to fears that the new powers could lead to innocent people having their savings taken. In the same year that prosecutions soared, 5.5million people were sent the wrong tax bill because of an HMRC mishap. Thousands more were sent incorrect information a second time despite the revenue trying to amend the mistake, it emerged this month. But critics say it has done too little to rein in dodging by big corporations. It is claimed the taxman has done deals with Google that allow the internet giant to avoid paying millions in the UK. The company funnels its revenues through Ireland, paying a fraction in Britain of what tax experts say it truly owes. Other large companies, including Microsoft and Amazon, use similar tactics that have been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs. Critics said there was a ‘gulf’ opening up between boardrooms and office floors. Deborah Hargreaves from the High Pay Centre think-tank said: ‘There’s a huge gap opening up. We’ve seen workforce wages stagnating across the board, while chief executives’ remuneration continues to go up. ‘This is not healthy for our economy, our country or our society. ‘They are getting all the benefits from a company’s success, while everybody at the company should be rewarded.’ Earlier this month the International Monetary Fund called for a radical shake-up of bankers’ pay. The global finance body demanded a ‘better mix of incentives’ for top executives.","Wage is almost 100 times higher than national average wage of £26,500 .

"Gangster: Curtis Warren is the first criminal to be the subject to a High Court order designed to stop him running his empire when he leaves jail . A notorious gangster has become the first to be banned from using payphones, carrying large sums of cash and having multiple bank accounts to stop him running his drug empire when he leaves jail. Curtis Warren made more than £200million through his criminal empire . and is the only drug trafficker to make it on to the Sunday Times Rich . List. The 49-year-old will be released from Belmarsh Prison in 2015 . after he was jailed for 13 years in 2009 over a £1million cannabis . smuggling plot in Jersey. Today Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer took the unprecedented step of applying to a High Court judge in London for a Serious Crime Prevention Order against the former Liverpool nightclub bouncer. Designed to prevent reoffending, it will impose restrictions on Warren’s access to mobile phones and telephone kiosks as well as limitations on bank accounts. The restrictions usually last for five years and Warren would be jailed for a maximum of five years if he breached any of them. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) has already had a serious . crime prevention order granted which allows police to keep tabs on him . and investigate his finances when he is released. Mr Starmer said: 'Organised crime, and persons involved in it, cause real harm to communities and ruin countless lives. It is our duty to take proactive action to limit the abilities of criminals to do this and to make the United Kingdom a much harder place for such criminals to operate. 'Curtis Warren has a long history of serious offending at home and abroad. By agreeing today to this order being imposed, he has admitted that he has been involved in serious criminality. 'There are very real grounds to believe that, without this order being made, Curtis Warren would continue to be involved in serious crime. This order will severely curtail his ability to do so.' Historic: The Order was obtained at the High Court today at the request of the CPS who want to control Warren on release . The exact terms of the order, which comes into effect on Warren's release, will be agreed at a later date. Warren was originally set to contest the application but Mr Justice Turner heard today that he had submitted to summary judgment against him. Warren was jailed in 1997 in the Netherlands when Dutch police seized a haul of drugs and banknotes worth £125m. But he claims to have little cash left after his bank account was frozen in 2011. Between 1997 and 2007, Warren was locked up in the Netherlands' highest security jail after being found guilty of conspiring to import £100m worth of cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and cannabis, as well as firearms offences. His sentence was extended in 1999 after he killed a fellow prisoner in a fight and was convicted of manslaughter. Five weeks after being released he was arrested by Jersey police and accused of being the ringleader of a six-man gang who were trying to import 180kg of cannabis into the island from the Netherlands via a boat from France. Warren is due before the Jersey courts later this month in connection with a £118million drugs deal.","Curtis Warren has made more than £200m through his criminal empire .

"Captain Cook may not have been the first European to settle in Australia after all. A 16th-century-style Portuguese cannon, that was discovered by a 13-year-old boy off a remote beach in the Northern Territory in 2010, has reignited the debate over who first arrived in the country. Research has shown the lead that the cannon is made from is linked to an ancient Spanish mine, meaning the historic artifact could have arrived in Australia before Lieutenant James Cook stepped off HMS Endeavour in 1770. The Portuguese may have even brought the swivel gun to the country before the Dutch made the first official European sighting of Australia in early 1606. Rare find: The 16th-century-style Portuguese cannon (held here by an unknown man) was discovered by a 13-year-old boy off a remote beach in the Northern Territory in 2010 . Teenager Christopher Doukas unearthed the historic swivel gun at Dundee Beach, about 120km southwest of Darwin, four years ago, when tides dipped to exceptional lows in January 2010 meaning he could walk out a long way from shore. He saw the 107cm-long gun, an anti-personnel light artillery piece, poking out of mud, dug it out with his father and took it back to his home. Portugal occupied Timor from 1515 until 1975 and it has long been hotly debated whether Portuguese explorers made it all the way to Australia, about 700km away. Discoverer: In 1770, Captain Cook made the first European landing on Australia's east coast. Here he is shown in a 1776 oil canvas by John Webber, displayed in the Museum of New Zealand . Claimed: Great Britain became the first European power to officially claim any area on the Australian mainland thanks to James Cook . Research by the University of Melbourne has shown that the lead in the cannon most closely resembled metal found at the ancient Coto Laizquez mine in the Andalusia region in Spain's south. The historians compared lead in the cannon to ore samples obtained from 2000 European sources and ruled out the theory that the gun was a later Asian copy of the Portuguese swivel. A Darwin-based heritage group, Past Masters, said yesterday that the findings showed the lead in the gun was mined on the Spanish Iberian Peninsula. 'It is simply likely therefore that the gun is of similar origin. European origin shouldn't be discounted just because it is obvious. 'This truly is the smoking gun of the Portuguese discovery of northern Australia,' a spokesman for the group, Mike Owens, told The Times. Last year, Australian scientist Tim Stone - also a member of the Past Masters - said the find will help rewrite the nation's history. Historical: This is one of the first ever maps of Australia and shows an adventurer's ship and what looks like a platypus off the coast . 'The cannon is one of the most significant historical artifacts ever found in northern Australia,' he said. However, the man who tested the lead - Matt Cupper, of the University of Melbourne - said that even if it was from the Spanish mine, it remained a possibility that the lead could have been recycled from another object and used to make the gun in Asia. 'Lead objects were frequently melted down and recast, so the gun could have been manufactured elsewhere,' he said. The cannon went on display in Darwin this week. Mr Doukas claimed he and his father knew that cannon was 'old' when he found it, back in 2010. 'As soon as we got it back into Darwin my dad got an angle grinder and nicked a little bit of it. We saw it was bronze, so we knew it was old,' he told the Australian Geographic. The cannon isn't the first artifact that has suggested Australia might need to rewrite its history books. Ancient African kingdom Kilwa coins, believed to date from about 1100, came to be discovered on the Wessels Islands off the Northern Territory in 1944 and have long posed questions about foreign visits to far off Australian shores. Aboriginal Australians are thought to have first arrived on the Australian mainland by boat from the Malay Archipelago between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago. Dieppe Maps, 16th-century French world maps which depict a large land mass between Indonesia and Antarctica, have led some to believe that the French then became the first Europeans to discover Australia in the 1500s. French navigator Binot Paulmier de Gonneville claimed to have landed at 'east of the Cape of Good Hope' in 1504, after being blown off course. But the place that he reached, which some believed to be Australia, has now been proven to be Brazil. There have also been persistent theories that Portuguese navigators reached Australia between 1521 and 1524, in part because of the Dieppe maps which are thought to be based on Portuguese charts. A number of relics and remains - including the cannon - have been interpreted as evidence that the Portuguese reached Australia first. What we know for certain, is that Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon made the first documented European landing on the Australian continent in 1606, at Cape York Peninsula. The first Englishman to land on the Australian mainland was William Dampier, a former pirate. He reached the northwest coast, near King Sound, On 5 January 1688 after his ship the Cygnet, a small trading vessel, was beached. Then, in 1770, Captain Cook made the first European landing on Australia's east coast. Great Britain thereby became the first European power to officially claim any area on the Australian mainland.","Portuguese, 16th-century-style, 107cm-long swivel gun was found in 2010 .

"I'm sorry: Shashank Tripathi has now apologised and resigned from the Congressional campaign for Republican candidate Christopher Wight . The rogue Twitter user who falsely claimed during Superstorm Sandy that the New York Stock Exchange was flooded under more than 3ft of water has been unmasked as a Wall Street analyst and political campaign manager. Shashank Tripathi, 29, has now apologised and resigned from the campaign for Republican candidate Christopher Wight to represent New York's 12th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives. He was even threatened with prosecution by New York City Councilman Peter Vallone, who said the tweets could be the digital equivalent of shouting ‘Fire!’ in a crowded theatre. The tweet - ‘BREAKING: Confirmed flooding on NYSE. The trading floor is flooded under more than 3 feet of water’ - was picked up by the National Weather Service and even CNN. It was retweeted more than 600 times. But an NYSE spokesman told ABC: 'It is false. Weather Channel issued an egregiously false report. There is no water in our building.' Responses to his tweet included: ‘that's bulls**t’, ‘What are the sources for your links?’, ‘confirmed by whom?’ and ‘you are a liar’. Mr Tripathi then posted an hour later: ‘NYSE DID NOT FLOOD’. The analyst - who used the Twitter name @comfortablysmug - was outed by the website BuzzFeed, which compared photos censored and posted on the account to unedited versions found elsewhere.

"A pie and mash shop in East London which has fed thousands of hungry cockneys and even survived a World War has been awarded Grade II listed status by Heritage England. Described as 'a unique part of the capital’s history', L. Manze Eel, Pie and Mash Shop on Walthamstow High Street was hailed as a 'unique part of the capital's history' by the conservation charity. The building, which was first opened to the public in 1929, has been given the accolade for its 'beautifully preserved interiors', which have never been replaced or modernised. Historic: L. Manze, which first opened its doors in 1929, has been described as a 'unique part of the capital's heritage' by Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey . Tradition: Pie and mash shops became a hit in Victorian times thanks to the simplicity of the dish, which meant it could be produced cheaply on site and served that day . Opened by Luigi Manze, the acclaimed pie shop was designed by architect Herbert Wright who introduced the traditional gilt lettering, marble counters, white-tiled decor and mirrors which remain to this day. The Manze family ran the east London eatery until 1970 before it came into the hands of Current owner Jacqueline Cooper. She said: 'It’s really a gem of Walthamstow and I’m just delighted because the shop is so beautiful'. Roger Bowdler, designation director . for English Heritage, said: 'This 1920s example, with it beautifully . preserved interior, is among the best of an increasingly rare kind, and . strongly deserves to be listed.' Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey also backed the award, saying: 'Pie and mash shops are as intrinsically linked to London as black cabs and Beefeaters. 'L. Manze’s in Walthamstow is a unique . part of the capital’s heritage and is as relevant and popular now as it . was when it first opened in the 1920s.' Good, honest food: Pie and mash was popular among the working classes of East London, who lived close to the Thames were eels could be sourced cheaply . Familiar: The traditional white tiles and marble surfaces of pie and mash shops are thought to have become standard because they are easy to clean down . Mrs Cooper believes the award has come at the right time for Pie and Mash shops, which she said are enjoying a renaissance thanks to the backing of London-born celebrities such as David Beckham. She said: 'We get all different walks of life coming in. I think it’s becoming a little trendier now - especially with everyone knowing David Beckham eats it.' The popular pie and mash of today is . much different to the dish which was first served up to poor Londoners . in the East of the city during Victorian times. It was a hit with locals because it was both cheap to make and hearty to eat. The eels came at a low cost to producers . because they were easy to source from the nearby Thames. They were one . of the few fish which could survive the polluted waters of the river, . making them a staple for Londoners of the time. Original recipe: Although pie and Mash shops have modernised, early incarnations of the meal were served with eel pies, potato and parsley liquor . Serving suggestion: Staff at L Manze, above, stick to the recommended technique for plating up pie and mash by administering 'liberal amounts' of liquor . The addition of some cheap mashed potato and a home made 'liquor', which came in the form of a green parsley gravy saw pie and mash become a sit down meal for hungry families. It's simplicity meant that shops could mass produce the hearty meal and serve scores of customers a day with fresh produce. After the second World War, eel supplies in the Thames began to dwindle causing their price to soar. This saw the growth in popularity of meat pies filled with cheap mutton or mince. Both variations are still served today. Classic: The simple plate remains a cheap and hearty meal for Brits, with pie and mash shops now popular destinations for tourists .","L Manze is the longest continuously open pie and mash shop in London .

"A man who falsely claimed benefits under his brother's name for nearly three decades has been found living in a holiday resort on Spain's Costa del Sol. Retired joiner Norman Brennan, 70, fled to Mijas from Britain five years ago just as he was due to be sentenced for embezzling almost £120,000 under the name of his brother who lived abroad. Today, as Brennan said he would not return to face justice, Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he would deal with the fugitive fraudster himself. 'This case is outrageous,' the politician said. On the run: Norman Brennan, 70, has been found in Spain after fleeing the UK where he'd admitted fraud . 'No': Norman Brennan told the Sky News reporter that he would not return to Britain to face charges . Brenna, formerly of Netherton, Merseyside, fled the UK in 2008 after pleading guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to seven combined charges of council tax, housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance fraud. For years he had claimed the benefits, which totalled nearly £120,000, in the name of his brother, Leslie, who had lived in Germany for nearly 30 years. Brennan was given bail when sentencing was adjourned, but gave authorities the slip and left the country. It is believed he went straight to Mijas where he is said to have bought two adjoining properties in a golfing resort. Today a television channel tracked down down the pensioner, who has long white hair, a bushy white moustache and uses a stick to walk, to the Spanish village of Mijas Costas. When asked by the Sky News presenter if the thought he should be in the UK, Brennan simply replied: 'No'. No plans to face justice: Brennan has lived in Mijas since he jumped bail in Liverpool five years ago . The pensioner, from Netherton on Merseyside, had long white hair, a moustache, and now walks with a stick . Mr Duncan Smith told the news channel: 'I’m astonished. I’ll certainly take this case away, and I know that I have myself fraud investigators who are out in Spain already. 'We’ll check this case, and I can promise you that if they haven’t done enough, they will now do their level best to get this man back. 'This sort of case is outrageous, and I’ll deal with it.' A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Merseyside Police can confirm assistance was provided to Sefton Council and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) with their original investigation into Mr Brennan. 'Since the issue of an arrest warrant for Mr Brennan in 2008 the force has been working with other agencies to locate and affect his arrest. This work is ongoing.' An international arrest warrant remains in place for Brennan.","Norman Brennan jumped bail in Liverpool court in 2008 and fled to Mijas .

"A Pittsburgh woman is suing authorities after she had to have her arm amputated because police officers used ‘excessive force’ while they arrested her and refused to give her access to a doctor. The mother-of-three, Amy Needham, 35, of Ross, says the officers entered her home to execute an arrest warrant for failing to show up to a preliminary hearing. When sheriff's office employees arrived, Needham said she was using the bathroom, but they broke down the bathroom door. Rough arrest: Police officers shocked Amy Needham, 35, with a Taser, applied arm bars and wrist locks, and put on handcuffs 'that were too tight' before taking her to Allegheny County Jail, pictured . 'Too tight': The handcuffs caused her to suffer compartment syndrome, a limb- and life-threatening condition that occurs after an injury, which resulted in her arm being amputated. (File photo). They shocked her with a Taser, applied arm bars and wrist locks, and put on handcuffs 'that were too tight' before taking her to Allegheny County Jail, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. According to her attorney, Marvin Leibowitz, the tight handcuffs caused her to suffer compartment syndrome, a limb- and life-threatening condition that occurs after an injury. It happens when there is insufficient blood supply to muscles and nerves due to increased pressure within the compartment, such as the arm, leg or any enclosed space within the body. If uncorrected, the lack of blood supply leads to injury in the affected muscles and nerves. Leibowitz says while Needham sat in jail, she made 16 requests to see a doctor for treatment but was denied. ‘They never sent her a doctor. Never . took her to the doctor. She developed a septic shock. The infection went . over and she almost died and they had to take off her arm to prevent . her from dying,’ Leibowitz told KDKA. Asked for help: The victim's attorney, Marvin Leibowitz, says while Needham sat in jail she made 16 requests to see a doctor for treatment which were denied . Needham, who had previously worked in a restaurant, is now waiting for a prosthesis. According to Leibowitz, the woman has had ‘severe psychological problems’ due to the incident. ‘I think she’s been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She doesn’t have an arm. How is she going to get a job?’ Deputies had arrested her for failing to show up at a preliminary hearing on a charge that was eventually reduced to disorderly conduct.

"'Brutal Nazi sadist': An historian has claimed that Gestapo chief Heinrich Mueller (pictured) who oversaw the deaths of millions of Jews during the Holocaust was buried in Jewish cemetery . One of the chief architects of the Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews during WW2 is himself buried in a Jewish graveyard in Berlin, an historian claimed today. Heinrich Mueller, the head of the feared Gestapo secret police who played a key role in the round-up and transportation of Europe’s Jews to death camps in occupied Poland, is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin Mitte, according to history professor Johanne Tuchel. 'Gestapo Mueller', who was one of the participants at the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 in which the extermination programme for the Jews was set in motion, was rumoured to have escaped to South America after the war. His body was never found. Tuchel, who heads the Berlin Memorial to German Resistance foundation, claims he died in the fierce fighting that engulfed Berlin at the end of the war in 1945. 'His body was thrown into a mass grave at the Jewish Cemetery in Berlin Mitte in August 1945,' he said. Professor Tuchel said he discovered the information in paperwork in 'various archives' even though western intelligence agencies for years suspected he had survived. In 1949, there was a sighting of him at the Czech town of Karlovy Vary, formerly the German spa resort of Karlsbad. 'It tramples on the memory of the victims': Tombstones in the Jewish cemetery in the Berlin district of Mitte where Mueller is allegedly buried in a mass grave . Architect of death: Professor Johanne Tuchel claims documents show Mueller was buried in his general's uniform with his ID papers in the left inside breast pocket of his tunic and his SS card . Heinrich Mueller remains the most senior figure of Nazi regime who has never been captured or confirmed dead. He was a police official under both the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany before becoming chief of the Gestapo. He was called 'Gestapo Mueller' to distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich Müller. As head of the Gestapo, he was present at the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 in which the holocaust was set in motion and later played a key role in the round-up and transportation of Europe’s Jews to death camps in occupied Poland. He was last seen alive between 1am and 2am on May 2, 1945 when he left a military hospital at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. There were rumours he had fled to South America and in 1949, there was an apparent sighting of him at the Czech town of Karlovy Vary, formerly the German spa resort of Karlsbad. But his body has never been found. But Professor Tuchel claims documents . show he was buried in the Jewish cemetery, near to the Luftwaffe . ministry of Hermann Goering, in his general’s uniform with his ID papers . in the left inside breast pocket of his tunic. Included in the paperwork was his SS identity card. The death certificate turned up by Professor Tuchel states on it that Mueller was a Wehrmacht - German army - soldier. In the confusion of the fall of Berlin, and in the administration of the divided city afterwards, the mistake went unnoticed until discovered by him earlier this year. The likely scenario was that Mueller was interned in one grave near the Reich Chancellery shortly after his body was discovered and re-buried at the Jewish cemetery some months later. The grave of Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn is near the site where Mueller is allegedly buried. Dieter Graumann, leader of the Central . Council for Jews in Germany, said: 'One of the most brutal Nazi sadists . precisely being buried in a Jewish cemetery is a tasteless monstrosity. 'It tramples on the memory of the victims.' He was last seen alive between 1am and 2am on May 2, 1945 when he left a military hospital at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Blood on his hands: As head of the feared Gestapo secret police, Mueller played a key role in the round-up and transportation of Europe¿s Jews to death camps in occupied Poland (above) Hitler had killed himself two days previously in his bunker. Tuchel produced a document, reprinted by the Bild newspaper, dated March 31, 1948, from the Berlin Register Office Centre which states: 'He fell in the Reich Chancellery, is buried in the Jewish Cemetery.' His address on the death notice was given as Nr 8 Prinz Albfecht Strasse - the wartime HQ of the Gestapo. A gravedigger called Walter Lueders said: 'I compared this photo with the face of the corpse. I can say that the person shown on the photo was identical to the body.'","Heinrich Mueller rounded up Jews and sent them to death camps in occupied Poland .

"The space shuttle Atlantis has been officially cleared for its final journey. Officials at the U.S. space agency have approved the craft for a cargo run to the International Space Station on July 8. The trip will be the final flight in Nasa's 30-year-old shuttle programme. Lift-off of the shuttle, manned by a minimal crew of four astronauts, is set for 11.26am (3.26pm GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. One more mission: Nasa has approved shuttle Atlantis for a final run to the ISS on July 8 . The 12-day flight was added to the shuttle's schedule last year to buy time in case Nasa's newly hired cargo delivery companies have problems getting their spacecraft into orbit. Atlantis will be delivering a year's worth of food, clothing, science equipment and supplies to the orbital outpost, a $100billion project of 16 nations that circles 220 miles (354 km) above Earth. 'This flight is incredibly important to the space station. The cargo that is coming up on this flight is really mandatory,' said NASA's spaceflight chief Bill Gerstenmaier. Earlier on Tuesday, the threat of an orbital debris impact interrupted the station's preparations for Atlantis' visit. NASA learned that an unidentified piece of space debris was likely to pass close to the station and told the crew to seek shelter in the station's two Russian Soyuz escape capsules. Typically, the station manoeuvres to avoid potential debris impacts, but the notice came just 14 hours before the closest approach, too late to plan and conduct an avoidance manoeuvre. 'We think it came within about 1,100ft of the space station. It was probably the closest object that's actually come by the space station,' Gerstenmaier said. Lift-off of the shuttle, manned by a minimal crew of four astronauts, is set for 11.26am (3.26pm GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . Final preparations: Atlantis astronauts Sandra Magnus, Doug Hurley, Commander Chris Ferguson and Rex Walheim pose for the press last week . The six station crew members divided . into two groups of three and sealed themselves into the Soyuz capsules . about 20 minutes before the object came closest to the station, which . occurred at 8:08 a.m. EDT (1208 GMT). It . was only the second time in the station's history that crews had to . seek shelter in their ""lifeboats"" for an orbital debris threat. The . station's two U.S. crew members are preparing for a spacewalk during . shuttle's Atlantis' eight-day stay, a job normally undertaken by the . visiting astronauts. Nasa, . however, has been trying to keep the Atlantis crew's training as simple . as possible, as the four shuttle astronauts already are tasked to do the . work of the six or seven people normally assigned to shuttle flights. The . U.S. space agency pared down the crew size to accommodate the smaller . Russian Soyuz spacecraft that would be used to fly the Atlantis . astronauts home in case the shuttle is too damaged to attempt landing. Long history: Atlantis in orbit, as seen from the Russian Mir space station in June 1995 . Soon-to-be-retired: Atlantis undocks from the International Space Station in September 2006 . Since . the 2003 Columbia accident, Nasa has had a second shuttle on standby . for a rescue mission if needed. Atlantis, however, is the 135th and last . shuttle to fly, with no backup shuttle in waiting. The . U.S. is ending the shuttle programme to save its $4billion annual . operating costs and use the money to develop spaceships that can travel . beyond the station, such as to the moon, asteroids and eventually to . Mars. Space Exploration . Technologies and Orbital Sciences Corp. are scheduled to begin cargo . deliveries to the station next year. NASA is hoping commercial companies . will be able to fly astronauts as well, though those spaceships are not . expected to be ready for at least four to five years. Meanwhile, Nasa will pay Russia to fly its astronauts to the station at a cost of more than $50million per person.",Shuttle to launch from Kennedy Space Center on July 8 .
"The Duchess of Cornwall gave a bottle of gin to a 94-year-old war veteran at the Royal Chelsea Hospital today. Camilla . presented John Ley, who is an in-pensioner at the hospital, with a . bottle of Highgrove Gin in a box decorated with ribbon to add to his gin . collection. The Duchess was . at the home of the Chelsea pensioners for the annual Founder's Day . Parade which commemorates the founding of the hospital by King Charles . II in 1682. Camilla met Chelsea Pensioners today as she visited the Royal Hospital Chelsea to review The Founder's Day Parade while her husband Charles presented an army regiment of  500 soldiers with their new colours . Mr Ley invited Camilla into his room where she handed over the 'special' gift. 'I've brought you a little present. It's very special,' she said, as she presented him with the gin. 'I hope you're going to make the most of it. 'A little bird did tell me that you like it very much,' she said. Mr Ley said he felt 'very honoured' to receive the gift from Camilla, adding: 'I shall certainly do it justice. 'It's very good. Well, it would be, wouldn't it?' While . in his room, Camilla noticed a photograph on the wall of Mr Ley with . Prince Harry who attended the Founder's Parade previously. Commenting on how he believed Harry would be a great officer, Camilla agreed with Mr Ley and said he is an 'excellent officer'. Mr Ley added: 'He won't let us down.' The parade commemorates the founding of the hospital by King Charles II in 1682 . The Duchess of Cornwall attended the annual Founder's Day Parade at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, London . Camilla also met George Bayliss, who . turns 92 next week, and admired his flower arranging while also . commenting that she too likes to work with flowers. 'I love doing flowers too. It's a wonderful thing to do. It keeps you very calm and happy,' she said. Adding: 'I hope somebody has taken a nice photograph of this. It's very impressive.' Mr . Bayliss, who joked that he was '21 and a bit', said the flower . arranging was 'all my own work' and described Camilla as 'quite nice'. Wearing . a green Fiona Clare coat dress and a matching Philip Treacy hat adorned . with feathers, Camilla met a number of the 300 in-pensioners as well as . staff at the hospital, both in the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary and in . the grounds at the parade. Wearing a green Fiona Clare coat dress and a matching Philip Treacy hat adorned with feathers, Camilla met a number of the 300 in-pensioners as well as staff at the hospital . She said that of the 111 pensioners who fought in the Second World War, some may have fought alongside her father in North Africa . Camilla shared a joke with many of the staff at the hospital in London . After . the parade, which featured a large number of the Chelsea pensioners and . took place in glorious sunshine, Camilla made a short speech. 'As . the proud daughter of a highly decorated soldier I am honoured to be . here today to review the parade at this very special event. '331 . years ago this great institution was opened to be a home to old or . disabled soldiers but surveying your resplendent scarlet ranks I can . only see evidence of soldiers,' she said. She . said that of the 111 pensioners who fought in the Second World War, . some may have fought alongside her father in North Africa. With . a nod to the servicemen and servicewomen who will join them in future, . she said: 'Before too long you will no doubt welcome those who recently . served in the Gulf, and eventually in Afghanistan.' Referring . to those who acted as a guard of honour at Margaret Thatcher's funeral, . she said they were a 'salutary reminder to the public, of the . importance of service to one's country'. After the parade, which featured a large number of the Chelsea pensioners and took place in glorious sunshine, Camilla made a short speech . Meanwhile her husband Prince Charles donned his ceremonial attire and presented an army regiment of  500 soldiers with their new colours. The Prince of Wales, as Colonel-in-Chief of The Mercian Regiment, formally presented each of the unit's four battalions - three regular, one territorial - with their new silk colours today at the Sixways Stadium in Worcester, Worcestershire. During the ceremony, an affair rich with tradition, he addressed the troops parading for the occasion and told them, 'I am endlessly proud of you all', adding that the regiment's history had shown the qualities of its soldiers' values, 'service, selflessness and sacrifice'. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief The Mercian Regiment presents New Colours to all four Battalions of the Regiment at Sixways Stadium . The Duke of Cornwall presented new regimental and Queen's colours to each battalion, wearing the black number one ceremonial dress of The Mercians, in front of hundreds of members of the regiment's extended family, including young children and veterans. It is the first time the unit has held such a presentation since its formation in 2007. Traditionally, the flags would form a . rallying point for the men of the regiment on the battlefield, and are . emblazoned with the names of famous campaigns in which the unit has . fought. Addressing the parade, Charles said: 'Today symbolises a special and historic moment of the whole Mercian regimental family, something serving soldiers, veterans, families and friends will all equally feel proud to be part of. 'As your Colonel-in-Chief I am also endlessly proud of you all and especially pleased to be able to share this day with you.' He said the regiment's history had shown the qualities of its soldiers' values, 'service, selflessness and sacrifice'. The Duke of Cornwall said: 'As your Colonel-in-Chief I am also endlessly proud of you all and especially pleased to be able to share this day with you' The Prince added: 'The last few years have seen tremendous courage, professionalism and self-sacrifice from those who have served on a whole succession of operational commitments.' He also praised the families for their 'support and resilience' while the regiment has served abroad, most recently in Afghanistan. 'Today, it is right that as a regiment we remember with gratitude and pride those who tragically are no longer with us and we also remember their loved ones whose lives will never be the same again and who are with us on this occasion,' he said. 'We salute those who were wounded in action and acknowledge the consequences of operational services and pledge ourselves anew to support those who bear the cost.' He said: 'Today, it is right that as a regiment we remember with gratitude and pride those who tragically are no longer with us and we also remember their loved ones whose lives will never be the same again and who are with us on this occasion' Charles added: 'The colours I have just presented continue to represent the heritage, fighting spirit and soul of this fine regiment. 'Each of you will also have your own special thoughts as to what makes the regiment of today what it is. 'That might be a friend you made for life, a time of challenge, a moment of desperate sadness, one of utter joy or something you have found enriching and which you have experienced with colleagues and loved ones.' Speaking to the 500 soldiers, the Prince said: Charles added: 'The colours I have just presented continue to represent the heritage, fighting spirit and soul of this fine regiment' He also said he was aware the regiment faced 'real challenges' and 'sadness' at the planned loss of its 3rd battalion, when its soldiers return from a tour of Afghanistan in 2014. The battalion is being cut as part of a shake-up of the Army, previously announced by the Ministry of Defence. He added: 'I wish you all every possible success and good fortune for the future.' Before the parade Charles met officers from the regiment, but also had time to have his photograph taken with Second World War veteran 93-year-old Brigadier Michael Dauncey, a glider pilot on the ill-fated Operation Market Garden attack on Nazi-occupied Europe in September 1944. He piloted his glider to Arnhem where British troops were aiming to capture a bridge, and despite being blinded in one eye fought on and was later decorated for his bravery.","Camilla was with the Chelsea pensioners for Founder's Day .

"It was one of the boldest plans of the Second World War, the biggest airborne operation in history. Nine thousand British and Allied tropps, dropped from the skies in a valiant bid to seize control of eight bridges in German occupied Holland. But the battle of Arnhem - later immortalised on screen in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far - was to prove too much for British forces, who were overcome by an elite enemy force. Now, a desperate telegram calling for reinforcements - sent from Major General Roy Urquhart on the front line to his commander Lieutenant General Frederick Browning - has come to light. The telegram that spelt the end of the doomed A Bridge Too Far battle of the Second World War has come to light nearly 70 years later . Operation 'Market Garden' (the Battle For Arnhem) was too much for British forces, who were overcome by the enemy's forces . Brave British Paratroops at Osterboek, Holland, September 1944, in the battle for Arnhem . The message was dated 9.14pm September 24, 1944, and few copies of it were made. After receiving the note, it was decided the 1,900 British paratroopers left standing at Arnhem should withdraw. They were successfully evacuated across the Rhine under the cover of darkness - and the noses of the Germans 24 hours later. It was General Browning - husband of author Daphne du Maurier - who coined the phrase 'A bridge too far' when assessing the reasons for the overall failure of the operation. The Allied troops had dropped into occupied Holland to break into Germany. Major General Roy Urquhart, pictured outside his headquarters, and the men of the British 1st Airborne Division, held a shrinking bridgehead at the Rhine River for nine days . Market Garden's architect, Field Marshall Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery (above left), and Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, who coined the phrase 'a bridge too far' (and husband of author Daphne du Maurier) The plan was for paratroops to take and hold valuable bridges - seizing them before they could be destroyed - while a column of armoured vehicles and reinforcements broke through enemy lines and used the bridges to drive into the heart of Germany. General Urquhart and his men . held a shrinking bridgehead at the Rhine River for nine days and faced a . hopeless situation as ammunition ran out. His radio message, through General Browning, was for Field Marshal Montgomery - the architect of the operation codenamed Market Garden. In the message Urquhart warned that the remainder of his dwindling ranks faced ‘complete disintegration’ unless reinforcements didn’t come quickly. The message fatefully reads: 'All ranks now exhausted. Lack of rations, water, ammunition and weapons with high officer casualty rate. British prisoners captured in the suburbs of Arnhem, September 26, 1944 . Thousands of British airmen were dropped from the skies in a bid to seize control of eight bridges in German territory . Out of the 9,000 British men, who were meant to hold Arnhem Bridge from the Germans for three days before being reinforced, 1,174 were killed and 6,000 were captured . 'Even slight enemy offensive action may cause complete disintegration. If this happens all will be ordered to break towards bridgehead rather than surrender. 'Have attempted our best and will do so as long as possible.' 'So not to damage the Allies’ morale anymore than it had been, he ended the message: 'NOT for general distribution.' Out of the 9,000 British men, who were . only meant to hold Arnhem Bridge from the Germans for three days before . being reinforced, 1,174 were killed and 6,000 were captured. The . telegram was handed by Monty to his adjutant officer, Captain Noel . Chavasse, who retained important and historic documents from the war in . his own archive. A Bridge Too Far: Sean Connery starring as Major General Roy Urquhart, commander of the 1st Airborne Division in Holland. The 1977 film, directed by Richard Attenborough, graphically depicted the heroic failure of Operation Market Garden . Captain Chavasse’s father was Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse, who is one of only three people to be awarded a Victoria Cross twice. The bold Allied operaton - codenamed . Market Garden, to get across the Rhine and into Germany - involved the . seizing and holding of several bridges in northern Holland. Thousands . of paratroopers were dropped over Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem to . take the bridges, while the Guards Armoured Division (XXX Corps) made its way along a . 60-mile road to link up with them. Arnhem was the furthest point from the tank division and thus proved to be ‘a bridge too far’, a term coined by Lieutenant General Frederick Browning. The . main problem the British men faced was the unexpected encounter of two . elite German Panzer tank divisions that happened to be resting in . Arnhem. The operation was . immortalised in an epic all-star movie that starred Sean Connery as Urquhart and . Dirk Bogarde as Browning. Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, Edward Fox, . Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, James Caan, Ryan O’Neill and Laurence . Olivier. Captain Chavasse’s daughter has now made the document available for sale at auction. The 15ins by 11ins piece of paper has previously been stuck to a piece of card and on the reverse is a signed photo of Monty. Bernard Pass, of auctioneers Bosley’s of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said: 'It isn’t the most valuable document but it is very historical. 'It spells out in black and white the grim and hopless situation the British found themselves in. 'This was one of the last radio dispacthes to come out of Arnhem and it was a ‘come and get us or we’ve had it’ message. 'The men staged a rearguard action for as long as they possibly could before the decision was taken to evacuate them in absolute silence and under the cover of darkness. 'It was only when the Germans woke up the next morning that they realised the British had gone and had left behind the wounded. 'The message was sent from Urquhart to Browning, who was in overall command of the British Airborne Division and had his headquarters close by in Holland. 'There couldn’t have been many copies of the radio message made up. One for Browning and one for Montgomery but not many more.' The document has a pre-sale estimate of £400 and is being auctioned on November 6.","Battle of Arnhem was biggest airborne operation in history at the time .

"A wallet and passport belonging to a British tourist have been found in Switzerland – 18 years after they were lost during a trip to the mountains. The man lost his leather wallet – containing his British passport, credit cards and receipts – while travelling by train from Zurich Airport to Geneva in 1996. Back then, John Major was still the UK's prime minister, pop group Take That announced their break-up and England hosted Euro ‘96. A British tourist's wallet has been returned to him 18 years after it was lost during a holiday in Switzerland . After 18 years the man’s wallet was finally handed in to police when it was found on the floor of a shopping centre in the picturesque town of Chur last month. Local police announced this week that they have tracked down the unnamed man via the internet and returned the wallet to him. The British man now resides somewhere in the US and he told police: 'If only my wallet could speak.' A police spokesman told Switzerland's SDA news agency: ‘We have no idea how it found its way from the train to a shopping centre. Police say they have no idea how the wallet found its way from the train to the town of Chur (pictured) ‘But the man was surprised and delighted to have it back, although the passport and credit cards had of course long expired.’ Even though it was missing for nearly two full decades, it appears the mysterious wallet contained all of its original contents, based on a photo provided by police. Police said it remained in good condition with little signs of use.","Man lost his leather wallet while travelling from Zurich to Geneva in 1996 .

"New York is deserted today on what should be one of its busiest weekends for tourism of the year, as businesses count the cost of a four-day city shutdown after Hurricane Irene forced people indoors. Retailers will . make heavy losses because of a shutdown on one of the last weekends before children go back . to school - and one of the most popular times for tourists to visit. But it might have been worse for New York City, as a direct . hit by the damage-wreaking hurricane could have cost it up to $35billion in . damage and increased the chance of a double-dip recession. No sales: Fifth Avenue looked deserted in New York while it was on shutdown during Hurricane Irene . However C. Britt Beemer, of America's Research Group, told . MailOnline losses will be ‘catastrophic’ for businesses, as this weekend would . have seen 10 per cent of back-to-school shopping. ‘It's catastrophic because you basically lose all the volume you were going to do,’ he said. ‘Many people in the U.S. are getting ready for the . kids to go back to school.’ Around 85 per cent of revenue shops would have taken this . weekend will ‘evaporate’, and it is especially bad because back-to-school is the year’s second largest shopping event, he said. One tenth of shopping ahead of school restarting would . have happened this weekend, as many parents would be taking their children on . holiday for Labor Day next weekend. As well as lost sales, damage is an issue as flooding is a separate . policy on most home insurance - so consumers will be left with less . disposable income after they have spent money on repairs. This weekend was going to see bumper sales for retailers - until Hurricane Irene came along. Parents would have been shopping for children ahead of the return to school next month. And New York City was expecting to be full of tourists visiting during the summer holidays. But all that lost revenue will cost the city's economy billions of dollars, experts say. 'It’s going to be tough,' Jon Taylor, president of Babylon Village Chamber in Long Island, New York, told Patch. 'We just don’t need this after having to weather the economy.' The total clean-up cost through 10 East Coast states is estimated at up to $13billion by Kinetic Analysis Corporation because of the widespread flooding in low-lying areas, reported ABC News. University of Maryland professor Peter Morici said up to $45billion of damage has been caused on the East Coast, factoring in physical damage and the loss of two days of economic activity. Around four million people have been left without power and more than 10,000 flights have been cancelled, while train services across the East Coast region remain indefinitely suspended. Wet, wet, wet: A view of a nearly deserted 7th Avenue near Times Square in Manhattan as Hurricane Irene closed in on the New York City, shutting down America's financial capital and most populous city . But in New York, a hurricane hitting at . around 100mph would have flooded the subway and acres of pricey real . estate in the five boroughs - as well as costing the city half of its . annual budget. The city would have required state and . federal assistance and recession fears would have been heightened from a . damage response cost of around one per cent of the total U.S. output. Governor Chris Christie said he expects damages from Hurricane Irene to run into billions of dollars along New Jersey's Atlantic coast and from inland river flooding. 'I've got to imagine that the damage estimates are going to be in the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars,' he told NBC. He said state damage assessments along the coast would begin on Sunday afternoon but that inland damage may not become obvious until river flooding subsides as late as Tuesday. One possible scenario was that the hurricane came ashore 50 miles east of Manhattan on Long Island, which would have caused around $10billion in damage, reported the New York Times. If an even stronger storm with speeds of at least 111mph was to have directly hit Manhattan it could have caused $100billion damage, according to estimates. A Category 3 storm could have rivalled the $235billion economic damage that the Japanese earthquake and tsunami was estimated to have caused earlier this year. A Category 4 hurricane seems physically impossible but if it was to happen in theory it could cause trillions of dollars of damage, reported the New York Times. Very quiet: As rain from Hurricane Irene falls, a single NYC Taxi Cab passes through Times Square in New York City, ahead of what is expected to be a quiet Monday morning as workers stay at home . Any hurricane hitting New York is . such a big issue as the city’s annual gross domestic product is . estimated at $1.4trillion, which is around 10 per cent of the whole U.S. output. This means a long-term non-functioning economy could cause a national and even global meltdown, and could make it one of the most expensive natural disasters the world has ever suffered. ‘We're looking at a multibillion-dollar event - that's almost certain. We're not looking at a hurricane as strong as a Katrina or a Hurricane Ike. But we are looking at a storm that will move over an area that has much greater population than an area like New Orleans or South Texas' Insurance expert Bob Hartwig . New York City’s real estate value is around $800billion, so analysts can only imagine what would happen if even a small percentage of this was to be destroyed by freak weather. The major cities affected by Hurricane Irene are New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massacusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; and Washington D.C. These account for a huge 16 per cent of U.S. national output and 14 per cent of employment, so a storm that disrupts work for several days could have a serious impact, reported The Fiscal Times. Insurers are expecting to suffer huge losses due to the hurricane, airlines are reeling as thousands of flights have been cancelled and shops cannot open so they losing sales. Clouds gathering: Manhattan is seen as Hurricane Irene approaches. A direct hit on New York City could have cost the economy up to $35billion in damage and significantly increase chances of a double-dip recession . The 1938 Category 3 hurricane that hit almost 40 miles from Central Park at speeds of 120mph caused the equivalent of around $45billion in today’s money, estimated meteorologist Roger Pielke. 'Any kind of severe weather tends to get insurance companies nervous. When they get nervous, their number crunchers take another look at what their exposure is and whether they’re charging enough and that may lead to rate increases'Consumer advocate Amy Bach . Other estimates from Kinetic Analysis suggest the hurricane could have threatened up to $14billion in insured losses and $20billion in overall economic loss, reported Bloomberg. Big problems include lost hours at work, power outages and a shutdown in sea and air traffic. ‘Any kind of severe weather tends to get insurance companies nervous,’ consumer advocate Amy Bach told The Fiscal Times. ‘When they get nervous, their number crunchers take another look at what their exposure is and whether they’re charging enough and that may lead to rate increases.’ Protection: Workers board up windows ahead of Hurricane Irene in the South Street Seaport area of New York, with companies expecting the hurricane to threaten up to $14billion in insured losses . Hurricane Katrina cost an eye-watering . $134billion in damage, as well as 1,800 fatalities, and although Irene . is a much weaker storm it is wreaking havoc over a significantly larger . area. Despite the horrendous weather and shut subway, the New York Stock Exchange still expects to open as usual on Monday morning. It has backup generators and can run on its own, but a spokesman said the exchange may change opening plans depending on the severity of the storm. With many traders living outside of Manhattan, a suspended transport network means it's unclear how many traders will get in to work. ‘We're looking at a multibillion-dollar event - that's almost certain,’ insurance expert Bob Hartwig told NPR. ‘We're not looking at a hurricane as strong as a Katrina or a Hurricane Ike. ‘But we are looking at a storm that will move over an area that has much greater population than an area like New Orleans or South Texas.’ There was expected to be damage to buildings and transport infrastructure from storm surges and heavy rainfall, as well as damage to vehicles and beaches, reported the Huffington Post. Petrol supplies fell as drivers filled up before leaving or just topped off their tanks as a precaution before the storm hit, with some pump prices rising around $0.03 per gallon overnight. Down: A power line pole lies on the street after being felled by high winds kicked up by Hurricane Irene in Montauk, New York, as the area was battered with heavy winds and driving rain on Sunday .

A washout could have a huge impact on retailers' top and bottom lines, as estimates were made that  Irene will stop around 80 million shoppers from hitting the malls this weekend across the U.S. ‘This is a worst-case scenario,’ Mr Beemer added. ‘This was supposed to be a prime weekend for apparel retailers.’","Last weekend of August is usually key for New York's $1.4tn annual output .

"Video has emerged of the moment a Playboy was hit in the buttocks with a golf club be a radio host at a 2012 golf outing sponsored by the magazine. Elizabeth Dickson, 28, is suing Playboy Enterprises and radio host Kevin Klein for $500,000 plus punitive damages after he whacked her in the behind with a golf club while trying to hit a ball off a tee placed between the cheeks of her buttocks during an amateur golf tournament in California. The model claims in a copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline that she gave no consent for the ball to actually be hit and that she has suffered pain, worrying and anxiety as a result of the incident - but she appears in the video to have a better sense of humor immediately after being hit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Not the best idea: Liz Dickson lying down with the tee placed in her butt cheeks before the shot (left) and with a giant welt on her buttocks after the poorly aimed swing (right) Better times: 28-year-old Dickson (right) smiles while out at a bar outing with friends . Dickson was invited to the Playboy Golf Finals held March 30, 2012 at the Industry Hills, according to the complaint. Klein is a co-host of the Playboy Morning Show. She complied with a request early in the day to lie ‘flat on her stomach with her buttocks partially exposed for a photograph’ with Klein, the suit first reported by TMZ alleges. ‘A golf tee was then placed between the cheeks of her buttocks and a golf ball was balanced on top of the tee,’ the suit continues, and the video shows. Fore!: Klein tees off, but catches almost as much of Dickson as he does the ball . Dickson was led to believe that the . pose would include only a depiction of Klein hitting the ball of the tee . for a picture, and not him actually swinging the golf club – but he did . swing the club, and he missed badly. The video shows Klein line up the shot and first miss it, causing someone to place it back on the tee. His second swing hits the ball, but it also leaves a divot in Dickson's backside. The model can be seen and heard writhing in agony as another woman tells her she has a welt on her behind. In agony: Dickson screamed out in pain as the woman at left told her she had a welt on her buttocks . In the rough: Off-cue radio host Klein, who's being sued along with Playboy by Dickson . Klein attempts to interview her for the radio show, but the conversation is drowned out by loud music. ‘[Dickson] sustained severe bodily injuries, a portion of which are permanent,’ according to the lawsuit. The suit claims Dickson was an ‘unwilling participant’ in his ill-fated swing and that it caused severe emotional and physical trauma.

"In the moments after Liverpool’s 3-2 victory at Norwich last April, Brendan Rodgers crowned Raheem Sterling as the best young player in European football. Sterling had scored twice and laid on another for Luis Suarez in a thrilling win at Carrow Road, increasing Liverpool’s lead over Chelsea to five points and six over eventual champions Manchester City. ‘Raheem is arguably the best young player in European football at the moment,’ claimed Rodgers after his exhilarating performance. ‘If he doesn’t win PFA Young Player of the Year it is ridiculous.’ Negotiations over a new Liverpool contract for Raheem Sterling have been going on for some time . Sterling's representatives are trying to get the best deal possible for their client . They've been sitting round the table trying to thrash out terms on a deal for the next five years . A month later Eden Hazard, four years his senior, won the award after scoring 14 times in 35 appearances in the Barclays Premier League for Chelsea. Hazard will soon sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge after agreeing, in principle, to a five-year deal worth £200,000 a week. So what is Sterling, promoted to England’s squad for the World Cup last summer and the recipient of the European Golden Boy award in December, really worth? Unfortunately there is no set formula. By amortising Sterling’s current valuation in the transfer market - say, for example, £35m - over the period of his proposed five-year contract, he could make a fairly solid case to be paid £7m a year (£134,000 a week). Liverpool’s offer is a long way short of that. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists there is a 'wonderful' offer on the table in front of Sterling . Sterling will be laughing all the way to the bank as he can expect a huge pay rise with his new deal . An alternative is for the club’s managing director Ian Ayre to ask around and build a picture of the salaries commanded by some of Europe’s best young players. For instance should Sterling, 20, earn more than Paul Pogba, the ‘Mona Lisa of football’, according to his bellicose agent Mino Raiola? Pogba has scored 18 goals in 80 appearances in Serie A for Juventus and earns £70,000 a week, but he plays in a country that no longer has the same commercial pull as the Premier League. More than Luke Shaw, who joined Manchester United for £28m last summer from Southampton and is paid £120,000 a week at Old Trafford? Shaw is still only 19 and his form has dipped markedly. Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard is set to pen a new Chelsea deal worth around £200,000 a week . Hazard has also been taking his time over talks on ha new contract to extend his stay in the Premier League . Certainly more than Wilfried Zaha, who signed a contract worth £40,000 a week when he returned to Crystal Palace following his disappointing spell at Manchester United. How about Martin Odegaard, the 16-year-old Norwegian who opted to sign for Real Madrid last month and is commanding £1m a year net at the Bernabeu? As much as Philippe Coutinho, who committed his future to Liverpool on February 2 by signing a contract, laced with incentives, worth more than £60,000 a week? The problem when you ask around in football about players’ salaries is that everyone, in the words of one agent, ‘puts a bit of VAT on them’. On that basis, these figures may not be accurate. To put Sterling’s career in England into context, two of the best young talents in Brazilian football earn around £10,000 a month each at Fluminense. Kenedy, a 19-year-old winger at Flu, and Marlon Santos, a defensive midfielder at the same club, are two of the most promising players in Brazil’s Serie A. How much is Sterling worth if Luke Shaw (above) is on £120,000 a week at Manchester United? Brazilian Philippe Coutinho (centre) has committed his future to Liverpool on a new deal . In the recent South America Under 20 tournament in Uruguay, Kenedy came to prominence when he scored a beauty for Brazil against Venezuela. Like Sterling, he belongs in the special talent category. If Kenedy and Marlon make it in to the national team, they will soon be heading to the Premier League for the really big bucks. Sterling is operating in a different environment, a place where money talks for the top talent in the English game. Sterling’s progress has been so rapid, speeding past various milestones in his young career, that he is now in a position to become the highest-paid young player in Europe. The problem for any club, even for an institution like Liverpool, is that when players are put on a pedestal the club becomes a hostage to fortune. Comparisons have been made with Sterling and Paul Pogba as two of the biggest young talents in Europe . Kenedy (left) will rake in the big bucks if he continues to develop and makes his way to the Premier League . Everybody appears to be in agreement that this is one of the most talented young players in the game. Liverpool’s offer, as Rodgers revealed in a briefing before Tuesday's Premier League clash with Tottenham at Anfield, is ‘wonderful’ and ‘incredible’. That is certain to be the case, but Sterling, who missed the game with Spurs though injury, is entitled to wait. Age is a constant theme in the negotiations with frequent reminders that Sterling is only 20. Look at it from Sterling’s position at the negotiating table and he will be entitled to remind Liverpool that he will be in his 26th year by the time this contract ends. He is in a strong position, particularly because he still has an ace up his sleeve in the form of the incoming television deal. If Sterling opted to run down his contract at Anfield, by the time the next round of negotiations with his agent takes place, the numbers swilling around the Barclays Premier League will be on their way up again. Whatever happens, this is a golden age for Sterling. Sterling will be in his 26th year by the time his new contract comes to an end so he must plan ahead .

"A health visitor with a first class honours degree in nursing was found hanged after she became tormented by her severe skin condition. Hollie McEwen, a dedicated professional, first suffered psoriasis as a 12-month-old but it eased with treatment. However, it later reappeared due to stress and the 28-year-old became so depressed she took her own life at home. Her father Andrew told an inquest: 'Her condition played a large part in what she decided to do. 'She was a beautiful, vibrant young woman who felt she couldn't deal with the condition. She felt this was the only way out.' The Doncaster hearing was told she had suffered from bulimia as a teenager. Her family believed the eating disorder  stemmed from her ongoing issues with her skin condition. Her mother Wendy said: 'Her skin condition played a large part in her problems as a teenager and when older I feel this was at the root of all the problems.' Hollie McEwen, 28, hanged herself just two days after she had sought medical help for her depression . Ms McEwen, pictured, had been prescribed drugs to help combat her depression . Hollie's body was found just two days after she had sought medical help for her depression. She had spent a long time writing several letters to loved ones which were found in a bin. Her father, who saw her the evening before the tragedy said: 'She was a happy, young woman who enjoyed her work and social life but she kept everything very close to herself. We had a good laugh on that last night and there was no indication she was unhappy.' Mrs McEwen said her daughter, who lived in Scawsby, Doncaster, had treatment for psoriasis over the last few years involving hospital stays and steroids after suffering anxiety attacks. Hollie had enjoyed a family holiday in Turkey but was 'down' after being given an anti-depression drug by her GP which failed to lighten her mood. 'She was an intelligent, determined and organised young woman,' she said. 'I told her to keep going with the tablets and give it time.' When told about her daughter's death she said: 'I was in absolute shock. Her death has left a large hole in our family. I still can't understand why this has happened.' Hollie's brother Andrew told the inquest: 'She was a happy young woman who enjoyed her work and social life. She kept everything very close to herself.' Assistant Doncaster coroner Fred Curtis said Ms McEwen's family was 'most loving' and 'really cared for her' He said there was no indication that she was unhappy the evening before she died. He added: 'As a teenager she was always conscious of her skin condition and it worried her greatly.' Hollie's neighbour Elaine Lunn found a note from her on the morning of Friday, May 23 asking her to call the emergency services so Hollie's family would not find her body. She said: 'I believe she had planned it. There was nothing to suggest prior that she was going to do anything like this. I feel totally distraught.' She added: 'She was a very attractive young woman. She was energetic, thoughtful and caring and studied to further her career. She was very bright and intelligent.' Nurse and friend Angelina Deighton, who trained with Hollie at Sheffield Hallam University, said she knew her psoriasis had worried Hollie and she said she was having treatment and counselling. 'She was always the life and soul of our friendship group,' she said. 'She was always bubbly. She had a boyfriend for a few months in 2013 but it fizzled out and she wasn't concerned about it. 'Lately she described being tired, down and just not coping. She had been to her GP for anti-depressants but she didn't think counselling would help her and she tried to help herself. 'I tried time and time again to get her to seek help. She had many friends who thought she would never do anything like this.' Behavioural psychotherapist Jessica Dunn, who had a session with Hollie just two days before she died, said Hollie had started to feel anxious and overwhelmed at having to plan a friend's hen party. The inquest heard Ms McEwen, pictured, had been avoiding her friends because her mood was so low . 'She was well presented with immaculate hair and make-up,' said Miss Dunn. She had 'dark thoughts' but had no intention of carrying them out. 'She told me ""I wouldn't put my family through that"".' Hollie had been avoiding her friends and not socialising because her mood was so low. After breaking down in tears in the witness stand Miss Dunn said: 'I had no concern for her safety.' Dr Elena Pamphilon, Hollie's GP for ten years, said she had come in for repeat prescriptions for medication to treat her psoriasis which she managed herself. She attended with depression and anxiety towards the end of 2013 and again this year. 'In May she said she was finding things overwhelming but did not mention any particular trigger.' The skin condition — characterised by raised flaking, itching red patches on various parts of the body — affects around 1.8 million people in Britain, most of them first affected before their 40th birthday. It is an immune condition that causes the body to produce too many new skin cells. The extra cells accumulate and cluster in red, inflamed patches, thickening the skin, which often has a ‘silvery scale’ appearance. A virus or infection such as tonsillitis — when the immune system is weakened — can trigger the condition in those with a genetic predisposition, as can a stressful event. Around 30 per cent of people with psoriasis get painful joints — sometimes the joint pain comes before the skin condition appears — because the immune system targets the joints, triggering psoriatic arthritis. The severity of the condition varies from person to person, for some causing a minor irritation, while for others it has a major impact on their quality of life. The condition is not contagious, so cannot be spread from person to person. There is no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can be used to improve symptoms and the appearance of the affected skin patches. In most cases a sufferer will be prescribed creams and ointments to ease the symptoms. The doctor gave her sertraline, an anti-depressant drug, but a fortnight later Hollie's mood had worsened and she went back. 'She may have had to wait longer to see the benefits of the drug,' said Dr Pamphilon. 'There isn't a drug to give more immediate relief.' Assistant Doncaster coroner Fred Curtis said: 'She was a young lady who has achieved well in just about everything she has done.' Although suffering from psoriasis and bouts of anxiety and depression she was 'happy and active' until her mood began to change towards the end of 2013. 'She had the most loving of families - a family that really cared for her,' said the coroner. 'They were aware of some of the problems but never the full extent thereafter not because of any fault on their part because Hollie did not reveal the full extent of the depression she suffered at times.' She never told her family, doctors or friends about her suicide plans. 'During the spring of 2014 her mood was at all times lower than that recognised by anyone,' said the coroner. 'That's not to criticise her family or health services. It may be down in part to the fact that she cared for so many people she didn't want them to believe she had a very low mood and didn't want to distress them.' He said her death involved planning 'which she kept from everyone.' Recording a suicide verdict he extended his sympathies to the family and said: 'She had been successful and had a good future ahead of her.'","Hollie McEwen fell into depression after suffering from severe psoriasis .

"Leading . GPs have called for all school nurses to be able to give the morning-after pill to teenage girls. NHS trusts in some areas have already introduced the scheme in an attempt to reduce the number of unwanted teenage pregnancies. But now GPs including Dr Anne Connolly, chairman of the UK-wide Primary Care Women’s Health Forum, have called for the scheme to be introduced nationwide. Pills: Nurses are being urged to reveal children's medical histories to their parents (picture posed by model) Dr Connolly said: ‘It’s a great idea. Giving out emergency contraception should not be done in isolation, but as part of a wider programme.’ The call comes after doctors in Scotland expressed a similar view. Current Scottish policy requires school nurses to direct pupils seeking contraception to reproductive health or sexual health clinics. But family campaigners fear that giving young girls easier access to the morning-after pill will only lead to increased promiscuity. Conservative MP Philip Davies thinks that if teenagers are given the contraceptive pill that their parents must be told . Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘Schemes like this are giving girls as young as 13 a licence to engage in illegal sexual activity and denying them the protection of the law that the age of consent is intended to give. 'Health workers who provide under-age girls with contraception without the knowledge of their parents are seriously undermining the role of those parents.’ Tory MP Philip Davies said if teenagers were given morning-after pills or contraceptive injections by school nurses, their parents should be told. School nurses can currently issue the morning-after pill to girls in some schools in Bristol, Northumbria, Peterborough, Oxfordshire, County Durham, West Midlands and Berkshire.","GPs want school nurses to be able to give out the pill .

"I don't think I need to use the populist modern phrase 'spoiler alert' here when I point out that as far as the BBC telly audience is concerned, the sports personality of 2014 was Lewis Hamilton. Although, now I mention it, I wonder if these are also the actual words that flash up on his dashboard when he has a problem with part of the bodywork on his Mercedes? But I digress. Because the point is, as far as the people who perhaps favour ITV are concerned, their man who wears the crown of the top sport celebrity of this year is in fact a former Superbike racer from Lancashire. Lewis Hamilton (left) celebrates his award from the BBC while Carl Fogarty (right) won I'm A Celebrity . Fogarty was one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time in his heyday . Hamilton won the F1 title this season, beating his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to the championship . Carl Fogarty was the king of the jungle on I'm A Celebrity, which came as a bit of a surprise to many. Not least of which, Foggy himself . And no doubt a few TV channels and production companies have Jimmy Bullard lined up to be the next Phil Tuffnell. Foggy, in fact, expressed his incredulity with a rather colourful speech at the British Comedy Awards. Especially, as he pointed out, he'd managed to get through an entire title-laden career without anyone noticing. And it is true that as far as high profile telly is concerned, four wheels are most definitely better than two. But it wasn't always necessarily that way. As the first man profiled in the new series of Racing Legends on BBC2 on Sunday evening, proved. Indeed, of the six legends featured in the programmes, Barry Sheene is the only man who did it with the engine clamped between his thighs. For this episode, Jim Moir aka Vic Reeves does the honours as the celebrity host charged with bringing his hero back to life. Reeves has a great track record profiling the likes of pirates and murderers in documentaries, but sportsmen has never really seemed part of his brief. But this is what Sheene was all about; exceeding his sporting boundaries. Or as Jim puts it so eloquently himself, Barry was a '200 miles per hour pop star'. Obviously with a man like Moir at the helm, this was never going to be a story told through a furrow-browed stare. Vic Reeves on the BBC2 show Racing Legends (left) and Barry Sheene with F1 star James Hunt in 1977 . But to think he wasn't taking it seriously would be to underestimate Jim's commitment to the Sheene cause. Which, as we discover, goes all the way back to his teen years when he, with his dad who had raced Nortons in the Fifties, first saw the youthful Sheene in action at Oliver's Mount, near the Moir's home in Scarborough. And Oliver's Mount is where the programme culminates, with our slightly nervous, but excited host taking Sheene's famous championship-winning bike for its first spin since 1977. In between that, though, is a mixture of interviews and excellent archive material that reminded us of just what impact Sheene had, in particular during his championship years in the mid-seventies. By then he had his long-time partner Stephanie McLean as part of his team. And Suzy Perry here perfectly describes this handsome couple as 'the first Posh and Becks - they epitomized the decade'. Jim chats convivially with Stephanie in the film. As he also does with Barry's sister Maggie, former fellow rider Steve Parrish and mechanic Martyn Ogborne. And they all freely give a personal in sight into a man who they all knew believed in his talent, worked at it with a sense of destiny and would enlist any one or do anything to realise it. 'He was incredibly demanding. Incredibly selfish. Some days I hated him,' recalls Ogborne of the man for whom he built the machine that Jim says 'was born out of obsession'. Sheene was a world champion and raced for almost 20 years before retiring in 1984 . Sheene married glamour model Stephanie McLean and went on to have two children with her . But Ogborne also freely admits it couldn't have been, and he wouldn't have had it, any other way. A point perfectly reiterated by his then nemesis on the track, the great Kenny Roberts. 'I got up every day to beat Barry Sheene,' he tells us. And clearly it was a rivalry that was fuelled by both an unswerving will to win and total, mutual respect. The footage of Roberts and Sheene going at it is epic. Just as the shots of him crashing and recuperating are shocking and compelling. But equally as revealing are the home movie images of this good-looking young fella who liked playing to the camera - from a schoolboy with his family to the teenaged novice with an impressive Mod haircut and his first Bultaco racing bike. Something that Jim also got to ride and which he describes as 'a thing of charm and beauty' that also happens to send 'vibrations up through your hands and into your mind'. But the main event was Moir on Sheene's Suzuki RG back at Oliver's Mount.

"This is the dramatic moment a three-month-old baby is rescued from heavy flooding that has so far killed at least 40 people in the Balkans. Members of the Slovenian military winched the baby into a helicopter as floodwater ravaged the northern Bosnian town of Šamac on Saturday. The rescue was part of a wider mission to deliver food and equipment to people affected by floods in the region. The Slovenian armed forces helped 52 people to evacuate the severely flooded area during the mission. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Rescued: A three-month-old baby is winched into a helicopter by a member of the Slovenian military as floodwater ravages the Bosnian town of Samac . Bosnia's government says more than one . million people have been affected by the flooding and landslides after . days of the heaviest rainfall recorded in the Balkans since records . began 120 years ago. The . video emerged as authorities warned of a new threat of disease from the . corpses of thousands of tonnes of livestock which drowned in the floods. With the rainfall stopping and temperatures rising, the withdrawing floodwaters revealed a harrowing sight: thousands of dead cows, pigs, sheep, dogs and other animals that were left behind after their panicked owners fled rapidly advancing torrents. 'There are tons of dead animals that we must dispose of,' Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic told a government meeting Tuesday. The rescue was part of a wider mission by the Slovenian military to deliver food and equipment to people affected by floods in the region .

Authorities are also warning that many . of the more than 100,000 remaining landmines dotted across Bosnia have . been dislodged by heavy rain, flood waters and hundreds of landslides, . shifting beyond their markers. Mine . removal experts estimate that more than 120,000 landmines remain . planted across Bosnia, the legacy of a war that killed 100,000 people . and displaced more than a million. Bosnia's .

New threat of disease: A Bosnian farmer prepares to take away dead cows from a farm near the town of Bosanski Samac along the river Sava, 200kms north of the capital Sarajevo . The withdrawing floodwaters have revealed a harrowing sight of thousands of dead cows, pigs, sheep, dogs and other animals left behind after their panicked owners fled rapidly advancing torrents . The record flooding in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia in past week has forced half a million people out of their homes and led to at least 40 deaths: 20 in Serbia, 18 in Bosnia and two in Croatia. Authorities say the death toll still could go higher. Bosnia declared Tuesday a day of mourning while Serbia said it would hold three days of mourning for flood victims from Wednesday to Friday. Witnesses say the waters in some areas rose within hours, racing into yards and homes without warning and flooding entire towns. In many cases, farmers did not have time to unleash their livestock or let them out of barns to try to swim to safety. Only some were pulled out in time. A Bosnian holds dead livestock near the town of Samac which has reported losing 450 of its 500 cows . Distressing sight: A dead pig lies at the side of the road near the Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac . Authorities in Bosnia have asked for . international help to deal with the animal carcass problem, while . governments in both Serbia and Bosnia have set up special phone lines . for people to reach sanitary teams to pick up dead animals. Serbian . state television on Tuesday showed army teams spreading out to . decontaminate and disinfect flooded areas to prevent possible diseases. Residents . also have been given special sanitary instructions: they are not to . return to their homes before disinfection and not to eat any food from . flooded gardens, orchards or barns. 'Dead . animals are a special problem. Those have to be removed and destroyed . properly or at least dug deep into the ground and covered with calcium . oxide,' said Bosnia's chief epidemiologist, Dr Zeljko Ler.

Several swollen livestock could be . seen along the roads leading toward Serbia's hard-hit town of Obrenovac, . outside the capital of Belgrade. The animal carcasses were apparently brought over from fields and barns for veterinary teams to pick up. In . Obrenovac itself, dozens of stray dogs and others abandoned by fleeing . owners were roaming the town's muddy streets, looking for food among the . scattered debris. Ler . warned that acute stomach ailments and other diseases - including . hepatitis and typhoid - often occur in the aftermath of the flooding.

'We are warning the population to drink only boiled or bottled water,' he said. 'There are still no mass infections (yet) but for some diseases the incubation period is 14 to 21 days.' In neighboring Croatia, authorities said they managed to save 7,500 livestock from eastern flooded areas and transport them to safety. The floods are still threatening Serbia's biggest power plant, located in Obrenovac, while in Bosnia, many areas faced new land mine dangers after hundreds of landslides hit, shifting mine fields left over from the country's war.

Water levels in the mighty Danube were also rising Tuesday and Serbian authorities ordered the evacuation of two villages along the banks of Europe's second-largest river. Both Serbia and Bosnia have appealed for international help, saying damage from the flooding will be measured in billions. The two countries still have not fully recovered from wars of 1990s, which claimed 100,000 lives and left millions homeless.","Infant rescued by Slovenian military as floods kill at least 40 in the Balkans .

"A mother of four who lost her feet and part of her legs after being trapped in the wreckage of her mangled car for six days has spoken about her harrowing ordeal and how she never gave up hope that someone would find her. Doctors believe Kristin Hopkins, 44, was just eight hours from death when she was finally found on May 4 by two passing motorists. Hopkins endured six days trapped in the wreckage of her vehicle 140 feet down a remote Colorado ravine off Highway 285. Kristin Hopkins, 44, lost her feet and part of her legs after being trapped in the wreckage of her mangled car for six days after her vehicle fell 140 feet down a remote Colorado ravine off Highway 285 . Speaking for the first time about her horrifying ordeal, Hopkins said her first thoughts after her accident were for her four children. ‘The first thing that came to my mind was, ""Oh my God, I have to go pick up my kids, it's a school day. It's Monday, it's my day to pick up the kids,'"" she told Good Morning America. The crash happened on April 27 sometime after Hopkins had left work, but her first memory was waking up the next day, upside down. ‘It was daylight and I wasn't in my seatbelt. [I] was lying on the roof of the car because the car had flipped. I had no idea where I was, what happened or anything.’ Speaking for the first time about her horrifying ordeal, Kristin Hopkins said her first thoughts after her accident were for her four children . Hopkins quickly realized she was trapped without access to food, water or her cell phone. ‘[I] tried to go out frontwards. I couldn't get out that way and then I was exhausted [and] took a little nap,’ she said. ‘Then I mustered the energy and tried to go out backwards and couldn't get out that way and kind of took another little nap.’ As Hopkins drifted in and out of consciousness, she can recall only fleeting moments of the more than 100 hours she spent trapped in the wreckage. At one point she found her red and white umbrella and scribbled messages on it with a Sharpie she found in her purse. On the white panels of the umbrella she wrote: ‘Thirsty + hungry … Six days no food or water … Please help. Can't get doors open … Need doctor. Hurt and bleeding.’ After six days stuck inside the wreckage of her vehicle, Hopkins was rushed to hospital in a critical condition to undergo double amputation surgery . ‘The one door I could open this much, I got the umbrella out and I opened it and it stayed there. …I don't remember what day that was,’ she said. Even as the days went by, Hopkins she didn't give up. ‘I never had that death thought in my head,’ she told KUSA. ‘It was more or less ... “when will somebody find me?'"" ‘I'm a mom, I had kids to worry about, kids to take care of. I had to keep going because they needed a mom. I couldn't leave my kids.’ She was finally discovered on May 4 by a couple who stopped after noticing some glare from the crashed vehicle, they never expected the car's passenger to still be alive. In a critical condition, Hopkins was rushed to hospital to undergo double amputation surgery from which she is continuing to improve. Cry for help: At one point Hopkins found her red and white umbrella and scribbled messages on it with a Sharpie to try and attract attention . ‘The first time I went from the bed to the wheelchair, I sat there and cried because I was like, “Oh dear God, this is going to be hard,”’ she said. Then, Hopkins said, she drew upon the reserves of strength and determination that had got her through her ordeal. She told herself: ‘Get over it, because this is your life...’ She is now focused on battling through painful physical therapy sessions. She started rehabilitation on Friday and will be fitted for prosthetics in a few weeks.","Kristin Hopkins was trapped in her wreckage of her vehicle for six days after it fell 140 feet down a remote Colorado ravine .

"Troubled country singer Mindy McCready is allegedly under investigation for any possible role she played in her live-in boyfriend’s shooting death, as new claims emerge that he was cheating on her and possibly threatened to leave her on the day that he died. The latest folds in the saga surrounding the death of McCready’s boyfriend David Wilson come as the National Enquirer alleges that he had been cheating on the singer and that brought out her jealous side. ‘David had been carrying on an affair . for many weeks before the shooting. When Mindy found out, it fuelled a . lot of very heated fights,’ an unidentified source reportedly told the magazine. Mourning: David Wilson, seen here with his country singer girlfriend Mindy McCready, was found with a gunshot wound on Sunday night and pronounced dead hours later . ‘The tension in their household became so unbearable that David packed up and left. He returned several days later to tell Mindy that he was going to leave her for good.’ Police in Heber Springs, Arkansas, have not said that there are any suspects in the case and their initial report on the shooting said that he died of wounds sustained by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In all previous reports, it was never clear if Mindy was in the house at the time that her beau shot himself on Sunday January 13, but in the Enquirer article, they allege that she was actually the one who made the 911 call. According to the magazine, she told investigators that she did not hear the gunshot because the volume on the television set was too loud and that the emergency operator even heard a man moaning in the background when she was making the call. In the business: Wilson ran Dave Wilson Productions and was also a songwriter . Picturesque: Wilson was found shot in the home he and Mindy shared on Fox Chase Road in Eden Isle neighborhood just off Greers Ferry Lake in Arkansas . Scene of the sorrow: David Wilson died at his Heber Springs home in an idyllic part of Arkansas . ‘There [seem to be] a lot of elements to the case that police feel simply don’t seem to add up,’ a source told The National Enquirer. He shot himself to death at the idyllic $180,000 home in Heber Springs, Arkansas, that they shared together. The revelations raise further questions as to why Wilson - with whom McCready had a son, Zayne, nine months - took such drastic action at a time when he appeared on the surface to be so happy. Close friends told MailOnline that they were clueless as to what could have gone wrong with a man they knew as ‘always in good spirits’. Troubled: Mindy McCready, 37, has waged a public battle with drug addiction since her career peaked in 1996 . Custody: Mindy had been fighting for custody rights over her elder son Zander (pictured) for years and allegedly was just awarded the landmark decision . The couple were reportedly in a good mood dating back to December because the troubled singer had finally been awarded custody of her elder son, Zander. McCready had taken her case to the Supreme Court which ruled in mid-December that she would be the sole guardian of five-year-old Zander, whom she had with her ex-husband. ‘Zander had come out of care and they were together. He was reunited with his mother. She was enjoying being a family,’ McCready’s spokesman Kat Atwood said. ‘Under the circumstances she is doing the best that she can. Her family are coming to her in Arkansas to make the final arrangements’.","David Wilson, 34, was McCready's live in boyfriend and her 'soul mate'

"Evidence emerged on Monday that President Barack Obama's transition team was notified five years ago that Veterans Affairs medical centers' official wait-list times bore little resemblance to reality and were sometimes denying military heroes critical health care. The Washington Times discovered through a Freedom of Information Act that waiting times at veterans' medical facilities were known to . be wildly inaccurate at the end of the George W. Bush administration. By the time Obama's transition team got a post-election briefing from . the VA at the end of 2008, scheduling failures were already reaching a . critical point.' 'This report and prior reports indicate . that the problems and causes associated with scheduling, waiting times . and wait lists are systemic throughout the VHA,' the briefing said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the White House 'learned about' the growing VA scandal 'through the reports' in the news, contrary to a report released on Monday that shows Obama has known about the scandal since he was elected . First of many flashbacks: Facing revelations that his IRS had played political favorites and intentionally hamstrung tea party groups, Obama said that he 'first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this.' That was also the White House's excuse today for not acting to improve veterans' care sooner . The American Legion and other veterans advocacy groups are hopping mad about an under-the-table waiting list scandal that appears to have cost dozens of lives in just one Phoenix medical center . Suicides: Psychiatrist Margaret Moxness told Fox News on Monday that she believes a West Virginia VA hospital?s appointment system was so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives . Obama's . transition team was told that nine of the VA Inspector General's . recommendations from 2005 to 2007 had not been implemented. 'Although . VHA has recognized the need to improve scheduling practices and the . accuracy of wait times data, no meaningful action has been taken to . achieve this goal today,' officials said. The briefing stopped short of saying managers and VA hospitals were lying about wait times, while admitting that they were manipulating the data they sent to officials in Washington. White . House Press Secretary Jay Carney wound up with egg on his face Monday as . he told reporters that President Obama first learned from a TV . news report that his Veterans Administration was denying medical care to . vets with secret off-the-books-waiting lists. A CNN reporter asked Carney on Monday when the president was 'first made aware ... of these fraudulent lists that were being kept to hide the wait times' at VA medical centers. 'You mean the specific allegations,' Carney asked, 'that I think were reported first by your news network out of Phoenix, I believe?' 'We learned about them through the reports. I will double check if that is not the case. But that is when we learned about them and that is when I understand Secretary Shinseki learned about them, and he immediately took the action that he has taken.' Obama has . come under fire before for saying he was made aware of scandal-worthy . shortcomings in his own administration by watching television, including . the IRS tea party-targeting scandal that rocked Washington 12 months . ago and the Operation Fast and Furious saga that has tainted his Justice . Department for years. After the Operation Fast and Furious scandal broke, Obama responded to national outrage in an interview broadcast by CNN's John King on October 12, 2011, similarly saying he was out of the loop until he turned on his television. 'There have been problems, you know,' the president said then. 'I heard on the news about this story that – Fast and Furious, where allegedly guns were being run into Mexico, and ATF knew about it, but didn't apprehend those who had sent [the guns].' A few months into his presidency, Obama's White House approved an unannounced New York City  flyover by Air Force One, with a fighter jet following closely, in order to capture a photograph of the iconic plane over the Statue of Liberty. Some buildings were evacuated and emergency phone lines were jammed as panicked New Yorkers feared a terror attack was imminent. 'It was a mistake,' the president said on April 28, 2009, the day after the flight. 'It was something we found out about along with all of you. And it will not happen again.' Last year on May 14, Carney told reporters that Obama had learned about his Department of Justice seizing two months' worth of Associated Press journalists' phone records 'from news reports yesterday, on the road.' 'We don't have any independent knowledge of that,' Carney insisted. That punt came just one day after Obama himself told the Washington press corps during a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister David Cameron that he was in the dark – until it hit news reports – that the Internal Revenue Service had targeted . conservative nonprofit groups for special inquisitions when they applied . for tax-exempt status. 'I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this,' he said in the East Room of the White House on May 13, 2013. 'I think it was on Friday.  And this is pretty straightforward.' 'I've got no patience with it,' Obama said moments later. 'I will not tolerate it. And we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.' Human face: This month Army veteran Kryn Miner was buried in Essex, Vt. His widow Amy Miner, third from left, believes the Veterans Affairs health system should have done more to help him as he struggled with PTSD. He was shot to death by one of their children in April after he threatened to kill the entire family . In 2011 Obama told CNN that he first 'heard on the news about & Operation Fast and Furious, where allegedly guns were being run into Mexico, and ATF knew about it' The president told reporters in 2009 that he found out along with reporters that his administration has approved an unannounced Air Force One flyover in NYC that spooked commuters and lit up 911 phone lines with terror-attack fears . White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told Sunday . morning talk show audiences the following weekend that Obama was first informed 'when it came . out in the news.' A year later, accused IRS targeting instigator Lois Lerner has been held in contempt of Congress and her fate rests with Attorney General Eric Holder. A criminal investigation in the  Department of Justice, which has issued no findings, is being managed by an attorney who donated thousands of dollars to Obama's political campaigns. Obama's reputation for using the news media as his own coal-mine canary reached comic proportions that week when 'The Daily Show' host Jon Stewart carped that 'I wouldn’t be surprised if President Obama learned Osama bin Laden had been killed when he saw himself announce it on television.' Some Republicans are fearing déjà vu as the VA medical scandal gathers steam. 'This is becoming a pattern,' a senior Republican Senate aide told MailOnline on Monday. 'The president supposedly learns about it while channel-surfing, tells us how outraged he is, and then what? Buries it?' Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki is under fire as his agency's health system seems to be coming apart at the seams and the White House claims it didn't know . 'That might wash with the tea party, but not with veterans. No one around here is inclined to let that happen.' The Veterans Affairs Department briefing given to Obama's transition team after his first presidential election victory warned specifically that its own medical appointment scheduling practices were putting lives in danger. 'This is not only a data integrity issue in which [Veterans Health Administration] reports unreliable performance data,' the transition report read; 'it affects quality of care by delaying – and potentially denying — deserving veterans timely care.' It also recommended a series of tests that would compare doctor appointments in veterans' official medical records with appointment times recorded in the VA's computer system. As the VA scandal gathers momentum, doctors are beginning to put a human face on the tragedy. Dr. Margaret Moxness, a whistle-blowing psychiatrist, told the Fox News Channel on Monday that she believes a West Virginia VA hospital where she once worked had an appointment system so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives. Bureaucrats, she said, 'don't really experience what the doctors and nurses are experiencing, which is the suffering and the pain and the death.' Moxness explained that her patients often had to wait months for follow-up appointments after she prescribed antidepressant medications that require check-ups after 10 days. Some couldn't wait out their psychological pain and committed suicide. VA Undersecretary for Health Robert Petzel resigned on Friday a day after telling a congressional committee that he was aware of a 2010 memo warning about the problems, which materialized in a Phoenix, Arizona VA medical center when as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting critical care. Computer records indicated that the vets were not on a waiting list at all. Carney hinted Monday that Obama is likely to address the new scandal. 'I'm sure you'll hear from him at some point on this issue soon,' he said.","VA .

"A celebrity chef told yesterday how she was attacked by a hammer-wielding gang of robbers whose crime spree brought terror to the streets of Hampstead. Children’s food guru Annabel Karmel thought she would die after being ambushed by muggers on mopeds who grabbed the 5ft 1in blonde and held a hammer to her head as they ripped her £12,000 gold Rolex from her wrist. The businesswoman spoke out for the first time yesterday after the robbers, who targeted celebrities and millionaire homeowners in North London’s luvvieland, were jailed for a total of 23 years. Scroll down for video . Corrie Moroney, 23, pictured left, was involved in all 12 robberies and jailed for 10 years, plus an extra 12 months for a separate assault.  Ellis Parkinson, 21, pictured right, was jailed for eight years . During a three-month crime spree, Corrie Moroney, 23, Alan Fitzgerald, 20, and Ellis Parkinson, 21, preyed on well-heeled residents living within three miles of Hampstead Heath. They snatched luxury watches, designer handbags and gold jewellery from their victims who were threatened with a hammer, knives and a Taser. They selected targets due to their ‘outward show of wealth’. One of their victims was newspaper executive Stan Myerson, the joint managing director of Northern & Shell, which owns Express newspapers, who was attacked in his driveway and stripped of his watch and cash. Alan  Fitzgerald, 20, was sent to a young offenders institution for four years . But the gang were finally caught after robbing Mrs Karmel who helped bring them to justice. The 51-year-old mother-of-three was mugged in broad daylight after parking on a side street in St John’s Wood where she planned to go shopping. She recalled: ‘I opened the boot and suddenly these guys on mopeds with helmets on were there on the pavement. ‘One held a hammer over my head and said in a really vicious way “give us your watch”. ‘I screamed, I thought they were going to hit me with the hammer. ‘It was so scary, I just knew they would use the hammer. They grabbed my arm, I couldn’t move. They cut my arm as they ripped off my watch. Then they took my shopping bag.’ The attack on June 20 last year lasted just minutes but Mrs Karmel was able to note the number plate of the moped. She reported the registration to police but was astonished when the Flying Squad were able to track down the offenders just 90 minutes later after following their movements using undercover officers and the police helicopter. Detectives showed her photographs of a moped they had recovered which still had Mrs Karmel’s £150 designer Henri Bendel canvas shopping bag in it. The evidence proved to be crucial in convicting the gang who later pleaded guilty to 12 robberies.

Corrie Moroney, 23,  pictured left, showing off on his moped, and Alan Fitzgerald, pictured right . Mrs Karmel told the Mail the ordeal continues to affect her: ‘It was terrifying… It has made me feel wary. Now I am more careful and worry about getting out of my car. I run into my house. I don’t wear a nice watch or fancy jewellery.’ Corrie Moroney, pictured, was involved in all 12 robberies . Blackfriars Crown Court heard how most of the victims were mugged on their driveways by the thugs who shattered car windows with hammers before stripping the terrified occupants of Rolex and Cartier watches worth up to £60,000 each, rings worth thousands and designer purses. The thieves – dressed in black, with their faces disguised by helmets, balaclavas and scarves – struck so frequently that residents in the wealthy North London district hired ex-gurkha soldiers as private security guards to patrol the roads. The first robbery happened on March 5 last year when a pensioner was ambushed outside his Hampstead home as he got out of his Bentley. The 70-year-old was hit with a hammer several times by the robbers who threatened to smash his kneecaps unless he handed over his watch. One girl of nine whose mother was mugged wrote a poem telling of her fear at the sound of motorbikes. The gang were finally snared after a two-week surveillance operation by the Yard’s Flying Squad who studied CCTV footage and witness statements to identify the robbers. Ringleader Moroney was sentenced to ten years in prison plus an extra year for an assault in a betting shop. Parkinson received eight years and his accomplice Fitzgerald four years.

"Record numbers of Americans are unable to afford their homes, new data shows. Housing is considered unaffordable when more than 30 per cent of the household's income is spent on rent or a mortgage, and according to a report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, more than 40 million American families - 35.3 per cent - were in that category at the end of 2012. The proportion of renters who pay more than 30 per cent of their income on housing rose 12 percentage points over the past decade, reaching 50 per cent in 2010. Crisis: Despite a slight decline in 2012, the number of households that pay unaffordable rents is high . Among them are 27 per cent of renters whose housing is termed a 'severe burden' by the researchers, meaning they pay more than half of what they make on rent. This problem is especially severe for low-income earners. More than 80 per cent of households who made less than $15,000 in 2011 paid more than 30 per cent of it on housing - and 71 per cent paid at least half. Those households also spent $130 less on food - 40 per cent less than those households without the housing burdens. 'Housing affordability is thus clearly linked to the problem of hunger in America,' note the report's authors, adding that these households also spend significantly less on healthcare and retirement savings plans. 'These cutbacks seriously undermine the basic well-being of low-income households,' the report says. Nowhere to go: In the 1970s there was a surplus of affordable housing, but now there is a shortfall of 5.3 million . Between 2004 and 2013, renting has increased across all age groups bar those aged 75 and older. Rentership for households aged 30-64 are now at their highest in the last 30 years and expected to continue to grow, while families with children are almost as likely to rent as single people. And while in the 1970s there was a surplus of low-cost rental propertie, there is now a deficit of 5.3 million units. Since the recession the number of households with very low incomes (defined as not exceeding 50 per cent of area median income) has increased by 3.3 million, but the number able to obtain housing assistance has expanded by only 225,000. Presently, only 23.8 per cent of households who need assistance receive it. The crisis especially affects minorities. In 2012, 27 per cent of black households, 24 per cent of Hispanic households and 21 per cent of Asian households were paying more than half their incomes for housing, compared to 14 per cent of white households. 'For renters, this is indeed a crisis of affordability,' says the report.","35.3 per cent of American households spend more than 30 per cent of their income on rent, a proportion that is considered unaffordable .
The proportion of renters who pay 30 per cent more for housing rose 12 per cent over the last decade .

"Barack Obama's controversial Israel policy was today blamed for a stunning Republican election victory in a Democrat stronghold which is 40% Jewish. In a devastating turnaround, Bob Turner last night became the first Republican to win New York's ninth congressional district since 1920. A special election was held in New York . City for Anthony Weiner's seat after he was forced to quit over Twitter . 'sexting' in June. Experts say the loss was New York giving President Barack Obama a bloody nose. Victory: Republican Bob Turner, centre, with his wife Peggy after winning the poll . Popular: The Crowd cheers Mr Turner as the Republicans celebrated an unexpected victory . Anthony Weiner speaking to the press in June after the scandal broke . Mr Turner, a retired media executive who called the election a repudiation of Mr Obama, won by six points - . 53 per cent to 47 per cent. This is despite Democrats outnumbering . Republicans in the area by three to one, a ratio that should have . assured a win for candidate David Weprin. According to the New York Times, Turner . took advantage of discontent among the Jewish community with Obama’s . policy toward Israel and the Middle East peace process. Mr Obama has been seen as taking a hard line stance towards Israel, opposing settlement building and putting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during peace talks. In doing so he has faced heavy criticism and accusations from the Jewish community that he is appeasing Arab countries in order to change the regional balance of power. Former Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, endorsed Turner in July as a way to 'send a message' to Obama on his policies toward Israel. And Weprin was challenged on his support of a proposed Islamic center and mosque near the World Trade Center site, in lower Manhattan. The victory is a further set back for Mr Obama who is facing dwindling support as he begins his campaign for re-election next year. The president, who has seen his approval ratings plunge to 44 per cent, is trying to shore up confidence in his leadership which has been battered by the economic crisis. Last week, he unveiled a $450billion package of tax cuts and spending plans aimed at creating jobs and encouraging growth. The election result came as a new . poll showed Mr Obama's approval rating has fallen below 50 per cent in . California, a state assumed to be an easy win for him next year. He carried California in the 2008 . election but Field Poll findings show people there disapprove of his . handling of the economy and just 46 per cent now say they support his . performance as president. It . is the first time since Mr Obama took office that his approval rating . has slipped below 50 per cent in the poll and it has fallen down 8 per . cent since June.

"Dozens of MPs are boosting their taxpayer-funded salaries by tens of thousands of pounds by taking second jobs. The new analysis found that as well as drawing their MPs salary of £65,738, many are juggling their political work with jobs in careers such as law, consulting and business and making up to 13 times their annual pay. In some cases, MPs are spending up to 20 hours a week working outside Westminster raising questions about their ability to serve their constituents properly. The Times examined the annual earnings of all MPs declared on the register of members’ interests as well as the numbers of hours worked by each. Extras: Dozens of MPs have been found to be earning tens of thousands more by having second jobs . It found that 68 MPs now make more than £10,000 a year each from outside earning - making over £6million between them. A total of 18 MPs earned more than £100,000. MPs must declare more details of their outside earnings from today under new rules in 2009 as part of the previous Government’s bid to ‘clean up’ politics in the wake of the expenses scandal. GORDON BROWN, LABOUR £900,286: Speeches, academic, and charity work . DAVID MILIBAND, LABOUR £410,171: Consultancy and public speaking . GEOFFREY COX, CONSERVATIVE £405,729: Legal work as QC . STEPHEN PHILLIPS, CONSERVATIVE £329,297: Barrister and crown court judge . SIR MALCOLM RIFKIND, CONSERVATIVE £246,359: Director of farming and asset management firms and consultancy work .

They are now required to reveal how much they earn from other jobs, how many hours they worked for it and who paid them - even if the work does not relate to their political role. Previously, they only had to name their outside employers and directorships in the Register of Members’ Interests, and give an indication of how much they were paid if the work was related to their job as an MP. Following the expenses scandal, few MPs ratcheted up more than a few thousand pounds outside Parliament. But the analysis found that six-figure sums have now become more commonplace. Many of the MPs made a robust defence of their work insisting that their experience of the real world makes them better politicians. Others insisted that it meant that they were more confident of speaking their minds without fear of losing their jobs. Senior figures on the list include the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown who has registered earnings of more than £900,000 from speeches, academic posts and policy work. However, Mr Brown does not personally gain from any of the money. It instead goes towards the running costs of the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown, which has donated over £500,000 to charity. Neither Mr Brown or his wife receive any salary, dividends or profits from the office. Another big hitter with high outside earnings includes the former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, who earns over £410,000, from consultancy work and speeches. Tory MP Tim Yeo reaped nearly £212,000 for working an average of 51 hours per month. Mr Yeo is facing calls to quit as chairman of the Commons environment and climate change committee after it emerged nearly £140,000 a year comes from green companies. The former environment minister is facing a threat from colleagues to depose him from the chairmanship due to his outside interests. Activists and MPs have said that he should be forced to choose between his leadership of the powerful select committee and his other jobs. But barrister and Tory MP Geoffrey Cox, who earned more than £400,000 over 12 months, insisted: ‘I believe it enriches Parliament. It allows you first and foremost to have independence of mind. I’m not dependent on the whips because my career is outside as well as inside. Highest paid: Prime Minister Gordon Brown, with his wife Sarah. The former PM earned £900,000 last year on top of his salary but says that he does not benefit from the cash . David Miliband has been blasted after it was revealed he received £14,000 for making a speech. Fellow MPs say anyone who wanted to pay that much to hear the former Foreign Secretary speak had 'more money than sense'. The Labour MP for South Shields received more than £116 a minute for a two-hour speech to a law firm at Claridge’s Hotel in London on June 14. The payment is outlined in Mr Miliband’s declaration on the latest register of MPs’ financial interests. He collected £441,821.60 in outside earnings since June last year on top of his £65,738 annual salary as an MP. Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who represents Blyth Valley, said outside earnings were wrong as it raised concerns about exactly who big-earning MPs were working for. He said anyone who wanted to pay money for a speech had 'more money than sense'. Mr Miliband received a total of £75,000 for 10 days work as vice-chairman and non-executive director of Sunderland football club between June 2011 and February this year. For making speeches around the world, the South Shields MP earned £120,258, while as an adviser to several firms and organisations, he earned £185,875.60 for 12 days’ work. Five days of teaching at America’s Stanford University last September brought in £25,027, with travel and accommodation worth £3,834 covered. A spokesman for the South Shields MP said: 'David Miliband’s job as MP for South Shields comes first, as shown by his speeches in Parliament.' ‘The trend is regrettable towards the professionalism of politics. If you want machine politicians, by which I mean party machine, we are going in the right direction.’ Tory MP Mark Field, who earns £49,240 as an adviser, said: ‘I think it’s actually quite healthy for MPs to keep abreast with the outside world’. Fellow Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who earns £122,000 as a partner in an investment management firm, added: ‘If you spend too much time on outside interests that is now declared so the voters can see that. If they think you are doing your job, they can re-elect you or otherwise.’ Liberal Democrat John Hemming, who earns £150,000, said: ‘If you upset the hierarchy, you can find you lose your job as an MP.’ Tory MP and chic-lit author Louise Mensch, who recently announced she was quitting Parliament to spend more time with her family, registered earnings of nearly £76,000 from publishing fees, royalty and media work. But campaigners questioned the nature of some of the work warning that it might ‘distract’ some MPs from serving their constituents properly. Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s nothing wrong in principle with Members of Parliament having outside sources of income, so long as their constituents know what they are up to and feel they are getting value for money. ‘The last thing taxpayers want is a House of Commons jam-packed with career politicians without experience of the world outside Westminster. ‘However, any other jobs they do should not distract them from their primary focus of serving their communities as MPs, and if voters think they have been badly represented for whatever reason, at the moment they clearly still have the option of voting for someone else come the next election.’","Majority of top earners get extra cash from legal work, consultancy, company directorships and public speaking .

"Former Labour minister Denis MacShane is facing a fresh police investigation after he resigned as an MP yesterday for fiddling his expenses. Scotland Yard last night vowed to examine a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards which found Mr MacShane guilty of submitting 19 false claims ‘plainly intended to deceive’ Parliament’s expenses authority. But he could still dodge criminal charges because evidence submitted to Parliament is inadmissible in court. Former Europe Minister Denis MacShane today quit the Commons, hours after a parliamentary demanded he be suspended for a year for claims which were claims were 'plainly intended to deceive' The former Europe Minister announced . he was quitting after MPs on the Standards and Privileges Committee . banned him from the Commons for a year for what they described as ‘the . gravest’ breach of expenses they have seen. Mr MacShane claimed thousands in . travel expenses so he could jet around Europe and for consulting . services using fake invoices from a front organisation that he had set . up. ‘The bills were signed with a “nom de plume” purporting to come from . a general manager who did not in fact exist,’ the MPs said. The former MP for Rotherham also . claimed thousands of pounds for computers and laptops, including one . which he allowed an intern to keep after they stopped working for him. The total Mr MacShane claimed on expenses for computers was £5,968. He even submitted the same invoice twice for one computer he bought. He also used his parliamentary expenses to ‘entertain his European contacts’ and claimed for ‘extensive’ book purchases. Commons expenses watchdogs said his claims for extensive European travel, including air fares, hotels and meals were of the ‘utmost gravity’. Mr MacShane claimed for eight computers on parliamentary expenses, and gave one to an intern when they stopped working for him . Labour leader Ed Miliband moved quickly to suspend Mr MacShane from the party today . In total the claims made between 2004 and 2008 were worth . £12,900. The Standards and Privileges Committee said it was impossible . to say how much Mr MacShane claimed ‘outside the rules’, but it ‘may . have been in the order of £7,500’. One MP on the committee said: ‘Based on what I have seen I think he should be in jail.’ Here is Denis MacShane's full resignation statement: . 'In the light of the Parliamentary . Commissioner's decision supported by the Committee of Standards and . Privileges to uphold the BNP complaint about expenses claimed in . connection with my parliamentary work in Europe and in combating . anti-semitism I have decided for the sake of my wonderful constituency . of Rotherham and my beloved Labour Party to resign as an MP by applying . for the Chiltern Hundreds or as guided by the House authorities. 'I have been overwhelmed by messages . of support for my work as an MP on a range of issues but I accept that . my parliamentary career is over. 'I appreciate the committee's ruling . that I made no personal gain and I regret my foolishness in the manner I . chose to be reimbursed for work including working as the Prime . Minister's personal envoy in Europe. 'I want to thank the people of . Rotherham for allowing me to serve as their MP and the Labour Party for . allowing me over the years to fight for the causes I believe in. 'I have received so many messages . supporting me from Labour and Tory MPs as well as members of the public . but I love the House of Commons and I hope by resigning I can serve by . showing that MPs must take responsibility for their mistakes and accept . the consequences of being in breach of the House rules.' Mr MacShane resigned as an MP after the Labour Party kicked him out and pronounced his career ‘effectively over’. A source close to Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Denis has done the right thing.’ But the affair is hugely embarrassing for Mr Miliband since he had only re-admitted him to the Labour Party in July. That came after the police announced that they were not pursuing fraud charges against Mr MacShane. But last night Scotland Yard said they . had not closed the case but had simply decided to take ‘no further . action’ after advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. Police did not previously have access . to evidence used by the Standards Commissioner since it was subject to . Parliamentary privilege. A Met Police spokesman said the force would now . consider the contents of the Commons report. Mr MacShane could still avoid charges . because letters in which he makes a number of frank statements about his . expenses claims submitted to the inquiry could not be used as evidence . in court. The Commons Clerk of the Journals, . Liam Laurence Smyth, who is responsible for parliamentary privilege . issues, confirmed that he believed none of Mr MacShane’s correspondence . or other evidence would be admissible. But he said police may now be . able to use the letters as a ‘map’ to further their own inquiries. Tory MP Philip Davies has written to . Scotland Yard calling on them to reopen their inquiries. He proclaimed . the findings ‘astonishing’ and said they ‘raise serious questions about . whether Mr MacShane is guilty of criminal behaviour’. He said: ‘If someone has committed an . offence then they should face the full force of the law and to be . protected by parliamentary privilege is most unsatisfactory.’ A second . letter calling for the case to be reopened has also been submitted by . blogger Paul Staines, who runs the Guido Fawkes website. Police will now examine the evidence . that between 2005 and 2008 Mr MacShane submitted 19 invoices from a body . called the European Policy Institute (EPI) for work including ‘research . and translation work as agreed’ and ‘research and translation . consultancy’. During part of that period he was a European envoy to then . prime minister Tony Blair. But the EPI had ‘no formal structure’. Names given on letterheads for general manager, an acting director and . four associate directors were old friends of Mr MacShane. The . organisation had no office and there had never been any salaried staff. The bank account was controlled by Mr MacShane himself. 2004: A visit to Madrid to inspect how Spain's new Government would impact British politics. 2005: January: Trip to Switzerland to meet MPs. Summer: Trip to France and the Netherlands     ahead of referendums on EU treaty followed by a visit to Warsaw ahead of Poland joining the EU. 2006: February: A visit to Poland to report on the country's politics. March: A visit to Berlin. Spring: Two visits to Switzerland to meet diplomats followed by trips to Paris and Pristina. 2007: Spring: A trip to France ahead of Presidential election. May: France again. November: A trip to Berlin, Paris, Frankfurt and Genoble. 2008: December: A trip to Warsaw for EPI meetings. The MPs on the Standards and . Privileges Committee said Mr MacShane’s expertise on Europe ‘does not . excuse his behaviour in knowingly submitting 19 false invoices over a . period of four financial years which were plainly intended to deceive . the parliamentary expenses authorities. This is far from what would be . acceptable in any walk of life.’ While Mr Macshane repaid the wrongly claimed expenses, the report found his actions went 'far beyond what was allowable' under paliamentary rules. Mr MacShane, a BBC journalist before he entered the world of politics, last night appeared to be . in denial, issuing a bizarre statement blaming his plight on the British . National Party, which submitted the initial complaint about his abuse . of expenses. He claimed his transgression was ‘the . manner I chose to be reimbursed for work including working as the prime . minister’s personal envoy in Europe’. Tory MP Philip Davies today asked the police to 'to consider reopening the investigation into Mr MacShane' Dear Sirs, . As you will be aware, today the Parliamentary Committee on Standards and Privileges has published its report regarding the expenses claims of Denis MacShane MP. The findings are astonishing and raise serious questions about whether Mr MacShane is guilty of criminal behaviour. I note Section 17 of the Theft Act 1968 below: . False accounting. (1)Where a person dishonestly, with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another,— . (a) destroys, defaces, conceals or falsifies any account or any record or document made or required for any accounting purpose; or . (b) in furnishing information for any purpose produces or makes use of any account, or any such record or document as aforesaid, which to his knowledge is or may be misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular; he shall, on conviction on indictment, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. (2) For purposes of this section a person who makes or concurs in making in an account or other document an entry which is or may be misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular, or who omits or concurs in omitting a material particular from an account or other document, is to be treated as falsifying the account or document. I understand that the evidence collected by the committee during its investigation was subject to parliamentary privilege, and thus could not be used by the CPS. Now that the report has been published, and parliamentary privilege no longer applies, I would ask you to consider reopening the investigation into Mr MacShane. Yours faithfully .

"Fightback: In response to the pink, flabby tubes of paste we serve our . children, foodies have launched a movement for real frankfurters - or 'haute dogs' Want to lose your appetite for hot dogs? Then visit a frankfurter factory. It’s an unpleasant business. In vast metal vats, tons of pork trimmings are mixed with the pink slurry formed when chicken carcasses are squeezed through metal grates and blasted with water. The mush is mixed with powdered preservatives, flavourings, red colouring and drenched in water before being squeezed into plastic tubes to be cooked and packaged. It is a disgusting process, for the hot dog is arguably the ultimate in processed, industrial food. In response to the pink, flabby tubes of paste we serve our children, foodies have launched a movement for real frankfurters — or ‘haute dogs’. Next month sees the opening of Bubbledogs, a London restaurant specialising in hot dogs and Champagne. The new generation of sausages are lovingly made from quality cuts, gently seasoned and smoked in the traditional German way, and smothered with gastro sauces and relishes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Originally hailing from the city of Frankfurt, they were simply pork  sausages served in a bun and doled out to the watching public for free during imperial coronations. Various German immigrants then claimed to have introduced the popular snack to America in the 19th century. From there, they have mutated into the processed sausage we know today. Charlie Powell from the food lobby group Sustain, said: ‘Cheap frankfurters are highly processed and have little in them that will improve your health. 'If they are eaten on a regular basis, they cannot be good for you. They are one of the least natural foods I can think of.’ And cheap hot dogs don’t just taste awful. Eaten in excess, they can be disastrous for your health. There is now scientific evidence that hot dogs — like all processed meats — increase the risk of bowel cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund recommends people avoid all processed meats — or cut down if they can’t give up their bacon, ham and sausages. The fund’s Dr Rachel Thompson said: ‘If everyone ate less than 70g a week — or two hot dogs — it would mean there would be 4,000 fewer cases of bowel cancer in the UK each year.’ So just what goes into the hot dogs to make them such a target for real food campaigners? Meat . Traditional hot dogs are made from pork trimmings — the pieces left over after chops, bacon and ham has been cut away — along with chicken or turkey. The meat is ground into a paste and mixed with water, preservatives, flavouring and colours. Many UK hot dogs have a similar meat profile. But not all. Appetising? In vast metal vats, tons of pork trimmings are mixed with the pink slurry formed when chicken carcasses are squeezed through metal grates and blasted with water . The Red Dogs varieties on sale at Tesco contain very little real meat. Instead, they are made up of 64 per cent mechanically-recovered chicken. Only 17 per cent is pork. Mechanically-recovered meat is the slimy paste created when a carcass — stripped of all traditional cuts — is forced through a metal sieve or blasted with water. The process is banned for beef after the BSE scare of the Nineties, but is permitted for pigs and poultry, and the meat produced is ten times cheaper than normal meat. Perhaps surprisingly, there is nothing particularly unhealthy about the product, and it’s approved by the Food Standards Agency. But under EU food rules, it is not classed as meat and must be labelled as mechanically recovered. Water . Much of the water in a hot dog is added to create the right consistency for the mushy paste, which is then squeezed into tubes and cooked. It’s also needed to hold together the frankfurter after cooking. Starch . All sausages — from the cheapest, nastiest brands, to the luxury free-range organic ones — are bulked out with carbohydrate starch. Hot dogs usually contain potato starch, wheat flour or rusk mixed with salt, baked and crumbled. Starches give more volume to a hot dog. They also bind ingredients together, and make the mechanically-recovered meat and pork trimmings feel more pleasant on the tongue. Salt . Hot dogs contain around 2 per cent salt and if eaten in excess can . increase your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease . Hot dogs contain around 2 per cent salt, which means they are classed as high-salt foods — and if eaten in excess can increase your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. A single 35g frankfurter has up to 0.6g of salt — one tenth of a teaspoon and one tenth of an adult’s daily recommended amount. Children aged four to six should have no more than 3g of salt a day, according to the Department of Health, while children up to three should have no more than 2g. According to Consensus Action On Salt, salty diets increase the risk that children will suffer high blood pressure as adults, and increase the risk of brittle bone disease, asthma, stomach cancer and obesity. Milk protein . Adding powdered milk proteins to the meat slurry also helps to bind it. There’s no health risk, unless you are allergic to dairy products. Some hot dog manufactures use pea and soya protein, which can also bulk out the hot dog, while adding to its protein content. E250 — Sodium nitrite . Processed meat increases the risk of bowel cancer and sodium nitrite is thought to be largely to blame. It is added to hot dogs to stop them going grey, and keep microbes at bay. Studies on animals have linked sodium nitrites to an increased risk of cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund carried out a global study on the dangers of processed meats and found that people who regularly consume 50g of processed meat a day — equivalent to one-and-a-half hot dogs — increase their chances of getting bowel cancer by 20 per cent. The charity believes nitrites are largely to blame. In the body, nitrites can react with protein-rich foods such as meat to produce N-nitroso compounds, or NOCs. Some types of NOCs damage the DNA in our cells and cause cancer. In 2006, scientists analysed more than 60 studies and found that nitrites are also linked to higher risks of stomach cancer. Flavours . By law, hot dog packets don’t have to say what flavourings are used in them. Many use artificial smoke flavouring, herbs, spices, celery and garlic powder. A few brands use the chemical monosodium glutamate — MSG, or E621 – to enhance the flavour. MSG gives food a ‘meaty’ feel and is used in soups, sauces and, infamously, Chinese takeaways. MSG has been accused of causing allergies, headaches and dehydration. However, despite the health scares, there is no hard evidence that MSG is bad for you, and it is found naturally in broccoli, mushrooms and tomatoes. E451 — Potassium and sodium triphosphates . Popular: A few brands use the chemical monosodium glutamate - MSG, or . E621 to enhance the flavour. It is particularly popular in Chinese cuisine . These are synthetically produced colourless salts that act as a ‘stabiliser, buffer and emulsion’. They give a hot dog a firmer texture, keep it at the right acidity and allow the oils and fats to mix with the water. E451 is also used in detergents as a water softener, and is added to flame retardants, paper, rubber and anti-freeze. There are no known health problems from consuming them. E452 — Polyphosphates . Another additive common in food. E452 is an emulsifier and stabiliser, improving the texture of the hot dog and stopping fat going rancid. It also helps prevent food-poisoning bugs. In the human body, E452 breaks down into phosphate and there is no evidence of a health risk. E301 — Sodium ascorbate . A form of vitamin C, sodium ascorbate is an antioxidant and acidity regulator that stops meat losing its red colour and which speeds up the curing process. At the low doses in hot dogs, it causes no problems. But when taken in large doses as a vitamin pill it can cause skin irritation. E120 — Carmine . Carmine is another word for the red food dye cochineal, which has no health effects, as long as you are not allergic to insects. For cochineal is made by crushing up the shells of small beetles. The shells are boiled in ammonia or sodium carbonate and the colour filtered off. The colour, found in supermarket curries, yoghurts, lipstick and pink icing, can trigger allergic reactions and even anaphylactic shock in some people. E160c — Paprika extract . Another natural food colouring, this time made from the dried pods of Indian red chillies. It is often added to cheese, orange juice, sauces and sweets. And finally... Even if you buy only the finest, most natural hot dogs, you’re not out of the woods. For hot dogs are one of the most dangerous foods you can give to young children. In America, they account for an extraordinary 17 per cent of all child choking cases and kill around 80 children a year. They are particularly risky for children under four because they easily get lodged in the airway and are difficult to shift. VIDEO: Don't watch before eating!

"Jahi McMath, the brain dead 13-year-old at the center of a battle to turn off her life support machine, may not 'make it through the day' after hospital treatment left her weaker than first thought, her lawyer told MailOnline. Chris Dolan said Jahi, pronounced brain dead after a tonsil operation, had 'deteriorated' more than expected because her body had been 'starved' while on a ventilator at Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California. Jahi was released from the hospital into the care of her family last night after a bitter and high profile battle with doctors treating her. Scroll down for video . Fears: The condition of Jahi, left, who was handed over to her family on a ventilator after a high-profile battle has deteriorated overnight . Dolan added that she had arrived at a secret facility this morning where she was receiving the best treatment available. But he said it was touch and go whether she 'would make it'. 'Jahi is in worse shape than we thought,' Dolan said. 'The hospital’s withdrawal of nutrients has caused her to deteriorate more rapidly than we thought. It is just sad. They have starved her.' Asked whether doctors hired by the family were going to fit a feeding tube, he said that they were assessing the situation right now. 'Because of the amount of damage to her throat she is not doing very well,' he said. 'Jahi is in very bad shape. Right now we don’t know if she is going to make it. The doctors are doing everything they can to help her make it through the day.' His comments came after the family finally moved Jahi from the hospital where she has been on a ventilator since suffering complications on December 9. The hospital had wanted to turn off the ventilator after she had been pronounced brain dead by three doctors and the local coroner had issued a death certificate. Devastated: Jahi's parents fought to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery last December . But the family, led by her mother Nailah Winkfield and uncle Omari Sealey, refused to accept there was no hope and agreed to take 'full responsibility' for Jahi if the hospital released her. They claimed that with the right care she could make a recovery. But the hospital insisted the girl could not be be rehabilitated. Spokesman Sam Singer yesterday criticized the family's decision to give Jahi 'nutrients' to maintain her brain at optimum efficiency. 'This is a deceased young woman,' Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer told ABC 7. 'No amount of food, medicine, medical machinery, time or hope is going to bring back her back. So it's really wrong and unethical for Mr Dolan to mislead the family and the public that there's any amount of hope or any food that could possibly bring back this deceased young woman.' Jahi left Oakland's Children’s Hospital & Research Center about 7.50pm in a critical care ambulance to the home of her mom, Latasha Winkfield. Before today's turn of events, the teenager's uncle said the family was 'ecstatic'. Hope: Jahi's parents are hoping to transfer the little girl to a permanent care facility. While the exact center is unknown, Allyson Scerri, who runs New Beginnings Community Center in New York has offered her services . Inspiration: Scerri founded the facility after her father, Al Barone, sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007 . 'I was with her when she left the hospital and the family is very grateful for this day,' Omari Sealey said. 'We are pleased she is away from Children's Hospital which has been trying to pull the plug on my niece since December 12. 'We fought and we fought to make sure she had a chance at recovery. 'She will now be treated like the precious little girl that she is.' The hospital last night said it wished the family 'closure' over the traumatic affair. 'Our hearts go out to the family as they . grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace,' they said in a statement. The . news comes after the girl's family yesterday said they had ‘everything . in place’ to move Jahi from the hospital to a long term care facility. Dolan said his clients had medical staff, transport and a . new home for the teenager and were just about to ‘get it all in motion’. While it is not clear where the girl . will be moved to, a New York facility run by a woman whose father suffered . severe brain trauma in 2007 has offered its services. New Beginnings Community Center founder Allyson Scerri said the outpatient rehabilitation facility has been named as a potential care center for Jahi. 'We . are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open . our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care as an inpatient, . long-term facility for Jahi with the required and appropriate medical . staff that she depends upon,' Scerri said in a letter included in court . documents last week, according to Koco.com. War of words: Children's Hospital Oakland . spokesman Sam Singer (right) has accused Christopher Dolan, the lawyer . representing Jahi's family (left), of misleading people about Jahi's . likely recovery . According to the facility's website, Scerri founded the facility after her father, Al Barone, sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007. Seeing . her father, a man of great strength and independence, inadequately . cared for was an unacceptable frustration for Scerri, the website says. The businesswoman told CNN she believes McMath could get better, with appropriate care. 'Her . brain needs time to heal. It's a new injury,' Scerri said. 'We believe . in life after injury, all of us here at New Beginnings have first-hand . experience because we have a loved one that was in the same situation as . Jahi.' Jahi's family has raised more than . $47,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her.

"Challenge: Mr Conville honed his skills in Scotland, where he was an adventure activities instructor . He was the climber whose love of Scotland’s mountains inspired his attempt on the feared Matterhorn - an Alpine adventure that ended in  tragedy and left his body locked in a tomb of ice. When Jonathan Conville plunged from the 14,690ft peak in 1979, the odds against finding his body were as high as the vertical challenges he lived for. But, 34 years on, melting glacial ice - a result of global warming - has revealed his remains, which have finally been reunited with his family. The 27-year-old ex-paratrooper was an instructor at an outward bound centre at Loch Eil, near Fort William, Inverness-shire, when he set out to conquer the Matterhorn – only to join the 250 mountaineers whose bodies have never been recovered from its perilous north face. Now his family - who founded a  charity in his honour - are preparing to scatter the ashes of the English former public schoolboy. Mr Conville had overcome troubled times to find peace in the Highlands. Honing his craft on the demanding peaks, he became a highly respected mountaineer. A few days after spending Christmas with his family, the Marlborough College ex-pupil set off for Switzerland with a Dutch friend. The path to his final adventure had been long and often troubled. He was not regarded as a model pupil at his school and left under a cloud, developing a drug problem in his teens. But after leaving school he travelled to Nepal, where he turned his life around. Ambitious: Mr Conville made his attempt on the Matterhorn, alongside a Dutch friend, in 1979 . Feared: The ominous Matterhorn in the Alps, viewed from Zermat . Once back in Britain, he joined the Parachute Regiment, developing a passion for the outdoors and learning to ski and climb. He left the Army in the 1970s and studied to be an outdoor instructor, eventually working for the Outward Bound Trust at Loch Eil. Scotland provided his ‘role in life’. Mr Conville’s sister, Katrina Taee, recalled yesterday: ‘He loved the Scottish mountains and the charity we founded in his honour to help young climbers continues to have very strong ties to the Highlands.’ Adventurous: Mr Colville was foiled by bad weather as he descended the Swiss peak . The Alpine colossus stands at 14,690ft on the Swiss-Italy border . It was in the Highlands that  he was reunited with childhood friend David Tidmarsh and together they took on harder and harder challenges. Mr Tidmarsh said: ‘As climbing partners we challenged ourselves on the classic routes. His death was hard to deal with at the time.’ Mr Conville’s quest for challenges led him to attempt one of the world’s toughest ascents. But bad weather closed in on him and his climbing partner as they descended the Matterhorn. Mr Conville disappeared and his friend had to be rescued by helicopter. The legendary Matterhorn, pictured right in 1937, is one of the most celebrated mountains in the world, and legendary in the sport of mountaineering. The Alpine colossus stands at 14,690ft on the Swiss-Italy border and with its four steep sides is one of the most photographed mountains in the world. But its reputation comes from being one of the most dangerous peaks for climbers, with 500 having perished attempting to reach the summit. In fact, so awe-inspiring is the Matterhorn that no climber visited its summit until 1865 – pretty late in Alpine terms. Of the seven men who reached the summit . in that first successful ascent of 1865, four met their maker on the way . down, courtesy of a broken rope. The mountain still claims a . regular supply of victims . Mont Blanc was first conquered in 1786, while the Grossglockner (Austria's highest peak) was crested as early as 1800. His remains were finally located by Swiss rescue helicopter pilot Gerold Biner, who was flying near the peak’s north face last month when he spotted abandoned equipment. Searchers then discovered bones and clothing bearing the dead climber’s name. The remains were taken to a forensic laboratory involved in the investigation in 1991 of ‘Otzi’, the 5,000-year-old ice age ‘mummy’ also revealed by the ‘retreat’ of glacial ice. The pathologists contacted the Jonathan Conville Memorial Trust website and Mrs Taee and her sister, Melissa, travelled to Switzerland to identify their brother’s  equipment and provide DNA samples. Mrs Taee said: ‘It was poignant. There was a mummified hand, with nails and skin, and cupped, as if it was waiting to be held. ‘It was 34 years on and I was holding my brother’s hand. It was bittersweet but wonderful. It took ages for the DNA results to come through but they confirmed what we already knew.’ Mr Conville’s remains have since been cremated and the family are still deciding where to scatter his ashes. Mrs Taee added: ‘It will be somewhere in the mountains he loved.’","Former paratrooper Jonathan Conville plunged from the Matterhorn in 1979 .

"Tea Party members in a boisterous crowd have provoked outrage and comparisons to 'Roman gladitorial combat' after suggesting people who can't fund their own healthcare should be left to die. Republican contenders were facing off at a CNN/Tea Party in Tampa, Florida, on Monday night when the most liberal of all the candidates, Ron Paul, was asked the question by host Wolf Blitzer. Mr Paul, a physician and opponent of federal healthcare, disagreed with just letting sick people die, but the calls from members of the audience suggest some Tea Party members think it’s a good idea. Scroll down for video . Debate: Texas Representative Ron Paul speaks during the CNN/Tea Party head-to-head on Monday in Florida . Meanwhile, Rick Perry’s ratings have slipped in three weeks as Barack Obama extended his lead to 11 points, beating the Texas governor 52 per cent to 41 per cent, a Public Policy Polling poll said. This follows his suggestion last week that Social Security is a ‘Ponzi scheme’. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney fares better as he is behind President Obama 49 per cent to 45 per cent. In the debate, Mr Blitzer suggested an uninsured young man could fall into a coma. Mr Paul said in return that he should ‘take responsibility for himself’ and people should be ‘taking your own risks’. It was then that Mr Blitzer asked him: ‘Congressman, are you saying that society should just let him die?’. This was followed by shouts of ‘yeah’ from the audience, reported the Los Angeles Times. Scroll down for a video from the debate, which shows the exchange and the audience's reponse. Many conservative Christian voters agree with Mr Paul’s idea that individuals and churches should have authority over healthcare, as many are worried about federal funding directed to birth control. Face off: Republican presidential candidates former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney (L) and Texas Governor Rick Perry (R) gesture during the debate . ‘We've given up on this whole concept that we might take care of ourselves and assume responsibility for ourselves, our neighbours, our friends, our churches would do it,’ he said. 'None of the Republican candidates on stage expressed a word of disapproval as the tea party audience literally clapped for blood. This was a spectacle one would have expected back in the gladiatorial combat of ancient Rome, not at a presidential debate' Eddie Vale, Protect Your Care group . ‘The cost is so high because we dump it on the government. It becomes a bureaucracy. It becomes special interests. It kowtows to the insurance companies, then the drug companies.’ Eddie Vale, of the Protect Your Care group, told the Los Angeles Times he was outraged by the audience’s ‘disturbing’ reaction. ‘None of the Republican candidates on stage expressed a word of disapproval as the tea party audience literally clapped for blood,’ he said. ‘This was a spectacle one would have expected back in the gladiatorial combat of ancient Rome, not at a presidential debate.’ Census data released on Tuesday showed that the number of uninsured people in the U.S. went up to almost 50 million last year. Fighting back: U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann waves as she is introduced during a GOP presidential debate sponsored by CNN and The Tea Party Express at the Florida State fairgrounds in Tampa, Florida . In the debate on Monday night, Michele Bachmann came out fighting in the Republican presidential debate tonight to put herself right back in the race with frontrunner Governor Perry. The Tea Party darling was all but written . off before the Florida showdown after being overshadowed by Governor . Perry’s dramatic rise in recent weeks. 'The cost (of healthcare) is so high because we dump it on the government. It becomes a bureaucracy. It becomes special interests. It kowtows to the insurance companies, then the drug companies' GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul . But in what was seen as a make-or-break opportunity for the Minnesota Congresswoman, she roared back into contention with outspoken attacks on two main targets, President Obama - and Governor Perry. Most of the candidates took potshots at Mr Perry, hoping to sabotage his hopes of cementing his position at the top of the standings, with former Massachusetts governor Mr Romney tangling with him on Social Security just minutes into the debate. But it was Mrs Bachmann who set the favourite back on his heels with a thinly-veiled attack on the motives behind one of his most controversial decisions as Texas governor. Until then, Mr Perry got the biggest cheers from the staunchly conservative crowd, refusing to back down from jibes made by Mr Romney and former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman. Pledge of Allegiance: Republican presidential candidates (L-R) U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, Mitt Romney and Texas Governor Rick Perry stand on stage before the start of the presidential debate this evening . But he was first cornered into apologising over a mandate he pushed through in Texas enforcing a cervical cancer jab for young girls as young as 12. 'What was driving me obviously was making a difference in young people's lives,' said the governor. 'Cervical cancer is a terrible way to die.' Mrs Bachmann would have none of it, saying: 'Little girls don't get a mulligan. They don't get a do over.' She then launched on the offensive, questioning Mr Perry's motives for ordering the injections and calling the human papillomavirus vaccination order 'flat out wrong.' 'We cannot forget that in the midst of this executive order there's a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate,' she said, adding that a former top aide to the governor was a lobbyist for the drug company. 'The question is, was it about lives or was it about millions and potentially billions of dollars for a drug company,' she added. In the running: Republican presidential candidates (L-R) Jon Huntsman, Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann, Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum . Mr Perry, taken aback by the allegation, said the company, Merck, made a $5,000 donation to his campaign while he raised over $30 million. 'If you're saying I can be bought, I'm offended,' he said. 'I am offended for the little girls and their parents who didn't have a choice. That's why I am offended,' shot back Mrs Bachmann. The only woman candidate also went after Mr Perry for signing the Texas DREAM Act in 2001, which granted in state tuition for some children of illegal immigrants, saying: 'That's not the American way.' The audience seemed to agree. The loud cheers greeting his earlier remarks turned to boos from some in the Tea Party-dominated crowd. In a recurring theme that played out through the evening, she also lashed out at 'Obamacare' and said that if she wins through to the White House she would 'pull it out by root and branch'. 'This is the election that's going to decide if we have socialized medicine in this country or not,' she added. The Texas governor came out better in skirmishes with some of the other six candidates on the panel. He . stood by his earlier claims that the Social Security is a 'Ponzi . scheme' and that it was a 'monstrous lie' to tell young workers that the . pension system would still be there as a safety net when they retire. Candidates: Republicans Ron Paul, left, Newt Gingrich, centre, and Rick Santorum, right, debate during the CNN Tea Party Republican show in Tampa, Florida, on Monday . And he sparred over job creation with Mr Romney, who conceded Mr Perry's advantages in Texas with no income tax, lots of oil and a Republican legislature, but added: 'If you're dealt four aces, that doesn't necessarily make you a great poker player.' Both men, until last night regarded as the most likely rivals for the nomination, exchanged bitter glances as they argued back and forth over Social Security and other issues. 'The real question,' said Mr Romney, 'is does Governor Perry continue to believe that Social Security should not be a federal program, that it's unconstitutional and it should be returned to the states?' Mr Perry hit back claiming Mr Romney was 'trying to scare seniors' over the issue. Mr Huntsman and former Pennsylvania lawmaker Rick Santorum also clashed over immigration with Mr Perry, whose insistence that a fence along the Texan border with Mexico was impractical was unpopular with the other candidates. Libertarian Ron Paul got the loudest boos of the night for his argument to slash military funding. He was blasted by Mr Santorum for claiming America's actions around the world had prompted al Qaeda's 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. The debate was the fifth involving the Republican candidates, but the first forum to feature questions from members of the Tea Party, which co-sponsored the event with CNN.

"Huge amounts of dissolved iron currently being released into the oceans from melting ice sheets might cancel out some of the negative effects of global warming, it has been claimed. A UK team has discovered that summer meltwaters from ice sheets are rich in iron. This can cause an increase in growth of phytoplankton - which capture carbon, they say. Figures released earlier this week show the Antarctic Ice Sheet is now losing 159 Gigatonnes of ice each year, enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 millimetres per year. A UK team has discovered that summer meltwaters from ice sheets are rich in iron, whihch can cause an increase in growth of phytoplankton - which capture carbon, they say. It is well known that bioavailable iron boosts phytoplankton growth in many of the Earth's oceans. In turn phytoplankton capture carbon – thus buffering the effects of global warming. The plankton also feed into the bottom of the oceanic food chain, thus providing a food source for marine animals. The researchers say this could effectively 'buffer' the effect of global warming. The plankton also feed into the bottom of the oceanic food chain, thus providing a food source for marine animals. The findings, reported in the journal Nature Communications, give new insight into how global warming is affected out planet's ecosystem. 'The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets cover around 10% of global land surface,' said Jon Hawkings of Bristol University, the lead author. 'Iron exported in icebergs from these ice sheets have been recognised as a source of iron to the oceans for some time. 'Our finding that there is also significant iron discharged in runoff from large ice sheet catchments is new.' The team, comprising researchers from the Universities of Bristol, Leeds, Edinburgh and the National Oceanography Centre, collected meltwater discharged from the 600 km2 Leverett Glacier in Greenland over the summer of 2012, which was subsequently tested for bioavailable iron content. Meltwater means that the polar oceans receive a seasonal iron boost as the glaciers melt, researchers say . Despite the catasprophic effects of climate change of some parts of the world, researchers say there are some positive effects. they include . Increased land for agriculture: Presently, vast swaths of the Earth — the northern half of Canada, for instance, and the majority of Russia’s land area — aren’t suitable for agriculture . Longer growing seasons - and even two harvest . Less energy needed for heating . Arctic resources become available . Boost in alternative energy research . The researchers found that the water exiting from beneath the melting ice sheet contained significant quantities of previously-unconsidered bioavailable iron. This means that the polar oceans receive a seasonal iron boost as the glaciers melt. 'This means that relatively high iron concentrations are released from the ice sheet all summer, providing a continuous source of iron to the coastal ocean,' said Hawkings. 'This is a substantial release of iron from the ice sheet, similar in size to that supplied to the oceans by atmospheric dust, another major iron source to the world's oceans. 'At the moment it is just too early to estimate how much additional iron will be carried down from ice sheets into the sea. 'Of course, the iron release from ice sheet will be localised to the Polar Regions around the ice sheets, so the importance of glacial iron there will be significantly higher. 'Researchers have already noted that glacial meltwater run-off is associated with large phytoplankton blooms - this may help to explain why'","Polar oceans receive a seasonal iron boost as the glaciers melt .

"New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen on Tuesday became the latest Democrat to find herself in the awkward position of having to distance herself from President Barack Obama in order to pacify her electorate. At a debate last night against her Republican opponent, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Shaheen was asked a 'yes or no' question about whether she approves of the job that President Barack Obama is doing. Shaheen completely ignored the 'yes or no' premise of the question, and replied, 'In some ways I approve, and some things I don't approve.' Her dodge drew roars of laughter from the audience. 'Like most questions that we deal with as policy makers, there aren't simple answers, yes or no,' she quickly added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen waves to supporters as she arrives for a live televised debate on Tuesday in Concord, New Hampshire. On Tuesday Shaheen  became the latest Democrat to find herself in the awkward position of having to distance herself from President Barack Obama in order to pacify her electorate . Democratic candidates' level of coziness with the president and his polices has become a critical issue in the midterm elections. Republicans have sought to capitalize on the president's unpopularity by tying their opponents to him in every way possible, and Democrats have tried to avoid Obama without denouncing him. Brown has made Shaheen's history of supporting the president's agenda a key part of his offensive in the New Hampshire Senate race. His favorite line of attack against his former colleague is that she's voted with the president 99 percent of the time. Early in Tuesday night's debate Brown trotted out the allegation and claimed 'it means she was the deciding vote for Obamacare.' 'She’s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time,' Brown added. Later in the debate Shaheen was given the opportunity to respond, and she didn't deny Brown's claim about support for Obama's agenda. Instead, she pivoted to her record of creating jobs in New Hampshire. A fact-checking website in New Hampshire said last year that it's 'mostly false' that Shaheen was the 'deciding' vote in favor of the president's health law, but it ruled yesterday that Scott's accusation that she votes with the president 99 percent of the time is 'mostly true.' The main discrepancy in the claim seems to be that earlier in her career she only voted with Obama 98 percent of the time, according to Politifact's analysis, though she's voted for his policy proposals 99 percent of the time since. The attack on Shaheen is particularly poignant given that 55 percent of Granite Staters are unhappy with President Obama's leadership, according to an Oct. 10 poll. Shaheen's opponent, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, accused her of voting with the president 99 percent of the time. Shaheen neither confirmed nor denied the claim. Instead she began talking about her record of creating jobs . President Obama made it even more difficult for Democrats in close races -  like Shaheen - earlier this month when he claimed that while his name isn't on the ballot, his polices are - 'every single one of them.' On Monday he put vulnerable Democrats back in the hot seat when he claimed that even the members of his party running away from him 'vote with me.' 'They have supported my agenda in Congress,' he said. The White House tried to downplay the significance of Obama's comments on Tuesday, saying that it's individual candidates whose names are on the ballot at the end of the day. Furthermore, the president's remarks were meant to help excite his core fans to vote this fall, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. 'The fact of the matter is... Democrats who are running in red states, blue states and in so-called purple states, are going to need the strong support of those voters who supported the president in his reelection campaign,' Earnest argued. Polls show Shaheen leading Brown by three points on average. Taking the surveys' margins of error into account, the race could be tied, putting Scott in striking distance of a political comeback. After losing his Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren in the 2012 general election, Brown relocated to Massachusetts' neighbor state New Hampshire in order to challenge Shaheen, who is up for reelection this November. Democrats have accused Brown of being a carpetbagger whose only interest is getting elected to public office. National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring said on Tuesday that Brown's ability to keep the race between he and Shaheen close is telling. 'Since August, Democrats have thrown the kitchen sink and everything under it at Scott Brown, and he is now in a statistical dead heat against Jeanne Shaheen,' Dayspring said. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee laughed off the possibility of a Brown win on Tuesday, however, and characterized him as a has-been. 'Scott Brown was a good candidate for 15 minutes five years ago, and now he acts like he’s Bill Murray in Groundhog Day,’ Matt Canter, DSCC spokesman, told Politico on Tuesday. 'Every morning he wakes up and pretends it’s still January 2010.' That January Brown was competing in a special election to fill late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's seat. His Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, made a number of missteps in the shortened campaign season, and Brown improbably won the election. Brown won't be so lucky this time, however, Canter said. 'The fact is that Jeanne Shaheen is one of the most popular senators in the country, and every poll shows voters know that Brown is out for himself and not the people of New Hampshire,' the Democratic Party spokesman said.","New Hampshire Sen.

"Rick Santorum believes U.S. military plans to allow more women to serve closer to the front-line could compromise missions because men have ‘protective emotions’ towards the opposite sex. New Pentagon rules will continue preventing women from serving as infantry, armour and special operations forces - but they will formally allow them to serve in other jobs at the battalion level.

A Gallup poll now shows him tied for second place across the U.S. with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, although former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney remains slightly ahead of both.

It was just so great to be home last night and get a chance to spend a lot of time with her and the rest of the kids.’ For the past decade women in the U.S. military have served, fought and died on the battlefields in Iraq and . Afghanistan. But Pentagon rules were catching up a bit with reality on . Thursday. War has already propelled women to the . front lines - often as medics, military police or intelligence officers . - but they couldn't be assigned as an infantryman in a unit going out . on patrol. But they could fly the helicopter . supporting the unit, or move in to provide medical aid if troops were . injured. Defence officials said the new rules will change that. They will formally allow women to be . assigned to a battalion and serve in jobs such as medics, intelligence, . police or communications officers, with the greatest effect on the Army . and Marines. Teamwork: U.S. Marine Female Engagement Team members Lance Corporal Shloss, right, Sergeant Perez, centre, and Corporal Kelsey Rossetti, of Derry, New Hampshire, wait to begin their patrol in Helmand . They ban women from more jobs than the . Navy and Air Force do - largely because of the infantry positions – but . there long has been opposition to putting women in combat. 'When you have men and women together in combat, I think men have emotions when you see a woman in harm’s way' Rick Santorum . Critics ask if they have the strength . and stamina, or if their presence might hurt unit cohesion, and suggest . Americans would be unhappy to see large numbers of women coming home in . body bags. But the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, . where battlefield lines are blurred and insurgents can be around every . corner, have made it almost impossible to keep women clear of combat. Thousands have served in the two wars, . and more than 150 have been killed. But a 1994 combat exclusion policy . bans women from being assigned to ground combat units below the brigade . level. Improving: Rick Santorum, pictured today with his family in Washington D.C., has risen from a non-contender to a major candidate in little over a month to do battle with Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney . Father and child: Rick Santorum, left visited his sick three-year-old daughter Isabella, right - who suffers from genetic disorder Trisomy 18 and is currently fighting pneumonia - in hospital on Thursday evening . A brigade is roughly 3,500 troops, and is . made up of battalions of about 800 soldiers. This means a woman serving . as a communications or intelligence officer can be formally assigned to . a brigade. 'She’s doing great. She was on the mend when I (last) left (her). It was just so great to be home last night and get a chance to spend a lot of time with her and the rest of the kids' Rick Santorum on Isabella Santorum, 3 . But she can't be assigned to the smaller battalion. The military has got around this by ‘attaching’ women to battalions, meaning they could do the work without the credit for being in combat arms. While the new rules won't open up the Navy SEALS or the Army Delta Force to women, former U.S. defence secretary Robert Gates said in 2010 that the military may eventually be open to that. Admiral Mike Mullen, ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said in November 2010 that 'large segments of women returning will have been exposed to some form of combat' in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"Britain's black and ethnic minority communities could account for almost a third of the population by 2050, according to a report published today. The number of people from minority groups could as much as double by then, it says. One in four children under the age of ten in the UK is already from a minority group and over the next few decades the proportion will soar, according to think-tank Policy Exchange. Melting pot: The minority population could double, researchers say . Currently, eight million people, or 14 per cent of the UK population, are from ethnic minorities. But they now account for 80 per cent of population growth, while the white population remains constant. Experts predict that as a result, by the middle of the century between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the population – up to 16million people – will be from a minority community, the report says. Ethnic minority communities predominantly live in three main cities, with 50 per cent living in London, Manchester and Birmingham alone. They are seven times more likely to live in an urban area than someone who is white. But over time, ethnic minorities will move out of deprived inner city areas and into suburbs and surrounding towns, echoing the way that white groups migrated in the past with the growth of the middle classes, the report predicts. Ethnicities are increasingly mixing: one in eight multi-person households contains people from more than one ethnic group. The report draws on survey, census, academic and polling data to build up a comprehensive picture of the five largest black and minority ethnic (BME) groups in the UK – Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Black Caribbean. The report says people from ethnic minority backgrounds also have a far stronger association with being British than the white population . Eight million people, or 14 per cent of the UK population, are from ethnic minorities . Indians are he largest minority group in the UK, with 1,412,958 people accounting for 2.5 per cent of the population. Britain is home to the second largest Indian population in the western world outside India, after only the US. There are 989,628 Black Africans in the UK. They are the fastest growing of the main ethnic groups, and also the most diverse, coming from countries both inside and outside the Commonwealth. There are 1,124,511 Pakistanis in the UK, 447,201 Bangladeshis and 594,825 Black Caribbeans. Minorities account for only 5 per cent of the total over-60 population, but 25 per cent of those under ten. Almost 30 per cent of pupils in state primary schools and around 25 per cent of pupils at secondary schools are classified as being from a minority ethnic group. 'With such a youthful age structure, it is likely the UK's BME population will represent a larger proportion of the UK's population over time,' the report says. All groups except Indians have unemployment rates that are more than double the rate of the white population. People from ethnic minority backgrounds also have a far stronger association with being British than the white population, the report says. It argues that politicians should stop treating ethnic minorities as one homogeneous group and start appealing to the varied political views and concerns of non-white Britons. Rishi Sunak, co-author of the report, said: The UK is now home to a melting pot of different cultures and traditions. These communities will continue to become an ever more significant part of Britain, especially in future elections. 'However, ethnic minorities are not one homogeneous political group. From education to employment, housing to trust in the police, politicians from all parties must understand the different issues affecting individual communities.'","One in four children under ten is already from a minority group .

"Soviets may have spent up to $1billion on unconventional psychology research from as early as 1917, it has emerged. A new report uncovering previously classified information has revealed how the USSR worked tirelessly to come up with a mind control programme that would rival that of the U.S. The paper by Serge Kernbach confirms for the first time that Soviets used methods to manipulate test subjects' brains. Dr. Bill van Bise, electrical engineer, conducting a demonstration of Soviet scientific data and schematics for beaming a magnetic field into the brain to cause visual hallucinations . The work titled 'Unconventional research in USSR and Russia: short overview' details the experiments researchers called 'psychotronics'. Kernbach, of the Research Centre of Advanced Robotics and Environmental Science in Stuttgart, Germany, based the work on Russian technical journals. He reveals how Soviets developed a device to generate and store high-frequency electromagnetic radiation called 'cerpan'. 'If the generator is designed properly, it is able to accumulate bioenergy from all living things - animals, plants, humans - and then release it outside,' writes Kernbach. The pyschotronics program or 'parapsychology' as it was called in the U.S. involves unconventional research into mind and control and remote influence, reports news.com. The new information sheds light on Soviet efforts to research the phenomenon of mind-control using unconventional methods. (Image taken from Secrets of Russia, a German documentary) The original scheme of transmitting and receiving bio-circuitry of the human nervous system as depicted in the report . While the two countries worked on their relative projects in secrecy, the report reveals much of what they were investigating was the same. Indeed the psychotronics program draws similarities to America's MKUltra - a human research operation experimenting in the behavioral control of humans through the CIA's Scientific Intelligence Division. The program was introduced in 1950 - some 30 years after the Soviets' efforts in parapsychology research. Though paper reveals the USSR's early research into the subject, it does not disclose the results of such experiments or whether or not similar work is ongoing in Russia today. An example of a generator from the psychotronics program of which very little was known in previous years . Unlike the Soviets' research, Project MKUltra has been well documented since being shut down in 1973. The program was officially sanctioned in 1953, and carried out much of its research illegally by enlisting unwitting subjects who were, on occasion, subjected to taking drugs without their knowledge. Researchers used various methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as various forms of torture. As many as 80 institutions carried out the research including universities, hospitals and colleges. It was first brought to the attention of the public in 1975 by the U.S. Congress, but all files relating to the research had been destroyed under the instruction of former CIA director Richard Helms in 1973.","Report uncovers previously classified Soviet research into mind control .

"An incredibly rare coin bearing the head of Edward VIII has sold for a record £516,000, the highest sum ever paid for a British coin. It is one of only two ‘proof’ gold coins that were struck ahead of the production of commemorative sovereign coins to mark the king’s coronation in 1937. But in December 1936 Edward abdicated in order to marry US divorcee Wallis Simpson, before the sovereigns were made, making the coins redundant. Today the coin collector who bought it said he would have bid another 50 per cent to secure the coin he called 'the greatest and most famous British coin of all.; . Record: This coin with the head of Edward VIII has sold at auction for £516,000 . Happy buyer: Auctioneer Ian Goldbart, with Jordan Lott, right, of Regal Rare Coins, holding the sovereign . Jordan Lott, of Regal Rare Coins, based in Chester, told MailOnline: 'I was the first to place a bid and I was determined to be the last. 'In the world of coins, it's the coin's story that makes it important, and this coin has the most fantastic story. 'It's also beautiful and in mint condition - I would have paid another £50,000 to make sure I got it.' Mr Lott, whose firm is part of the Regal Group which is featured in Pawn Stars UK, the British version of the hit TV series Pawn Stars, says he will hang on to the coin, which he believes will be a good investment. He said: 'It last sold in Tokyo in 1984 for £40,000 and I wish I'd bought it then.  British coins are seriously undervalued.' Only six of the coins were ever made to show the King: four are in museums, one is in a complete set of rare sovereigns, and this is the sixth. After some fierce bidding it eventually sold for £430,000, but with fees the total hit £516,000. Abdicated: King Edward VIII stepped down from the throne in 1936 to marry a divorcée . The price represents a world record for a Royal mint coin produced in the UK. Ever controversial, Edward refused to follow coinage tradition and . have his head face the opposite direction to his predecessor, his father . King George V, who had faced left. This tradition started in the 17th century with King Charles II who wished to face the opposite way to Oliver Cromwell and has been followed ever since. Edward sat for portraits and presentations of plaster models for the coin in February 1936, a month after he became King. On the reverse of the gold coin is St George slaying a dragon with his sword and the year of 1937.","Coin is one of two gold 'proofs' struck before planned 1937 coronation .

"Civil War solider 1st Lieutenant Alonzo Hersford Cushing will be awarded the Medal of Honor next month, 151 years after his valiant death in the Battle of Gettysburg at the age of 22 . More than a century and half after his valiant death in the Battle of Gettysburg, a Civil War soldier will be awarded the Medal of Honor. The White House announced today that President Obama approved the nation's highest military accolade for 1st Lieutenant Alonzo Hersford Cushing after a hard-fought campaign by his descendants and Civil War historians. Congress granted a special exemption for Lt Cushing, as the medal usually has to be awarded within three years of the act of heroism. Lt Cushing was killed while standing his ground during Pickett's Charge on the third and final day of the battle in July 1863, aged just 22. His platoon was defending the Union position against Pickett's Charge, a major Confederate thrust that could have turned the tide in the Civil War. Lt Cushing was wounded by a bullet to the head as his small force came under artillery bombardment as nearly 13,000 Confederate infantrymen waited to advance, but he continued to fight despite his grave injuries. 'The Confederate cannon sent volleys over the heads of their advancing troops into the Union lines,' ABC News cited the Waukesha Freeman as saying in 1911. 'Cushing and his neighbors replied with never ceasing spirit, in spite of a constant rain of shot and shell, with horses and men falling all around. 'Cushing was shot several times but kept on firing. He served his last round of canister, was struck in the mouth by a bullet and fell dead.' Confederate soldiers advanced into the Union fire but eventually retreated with massive losses. The South never recovered from the defeat. Lt Cushing was among 51,000 deaths during the fierce battle near the town in Pennsylvania. President Barack Obama will award Lt Cushing and two Vietnam War veterans in a ceremony in September. Here the President is pictured awarding the medal to Army Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta in 2010 . The White House announcement said: 'Refusing to evacuate to the rear despite his severe wounds, he directed the operation of his lone field piece continuing to fire in the face of the enemy. 'With the rebels within 100 yards of his position, Cushing was shot and killed during this heroic stand. The Medal of Honor is the highest military award for U.S. servicemen. It has been awarded to 3,450 people in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard since it was introduced in 1863. 621 of these medals were given out posthumously, including 523 since the outbreak of World War II. Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta (pictured above) was the first living soldier to receive the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War. More than 1,500 medals have been given to Civil War soldiers. 124 were handed out to World War I servicemen, 464 to those in WWII, and 16 to soldiers in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Only one woman, Mary Edwards Walker, has been awarded the medal. She was a Union Army surgeon in the Civil War. 19 people have received two Medals of Honor in their lifetime. Nine Unknown Soldiers have been awarded the medal, including the British Unknown Warrior. 'His actions made it possible for the Union Army to successfully repulse the Confederate assault.' The medal is given to members of the U.S. armed forces who risk their own lives in acts of great personal bravery. Lt. Cushing, who was born in Delafield, Wisconsin, and brought up in New York, commanded about 110 men and six cannons during the Battle of Gettysburg. More than 1,500 soldiers from the Civil War have received the Medal of Honor, but despite a campaign since the 1980s by descendants and admirers of Lt Cushing, he was never chosen for the honor. The White House also announced that Obama will award the medal to two Vietnam soldiers - Army Command Sergeant Major Bennie G. Adkins and Army Specialist Donald P. Sloat - in a ceremony on September 15. Sgt Adkins, who served for 22 years and was deployed to Vietnam three times with the special forces, plans to receive his medal in person. He is being awarded for actions in combat on his second tour, in 1966, when he ran wounded through enemy fire to drag wounded comrades to safety. Mr Sloat, from Oklahoma, was killed in action in Vietnam in 1970, aged 20. He picked up a live grenade triggered by a fellow soldier and used his own body to shield the blast and save his fellow soldiers.

"They were nicknamed les poilu, meaning the hairy ones. And given the brutal, unrelenting hardships French soldiers had to face in the First World War, that was perhaps understandable. Now a collection of glass plates has emerged giving a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of the French as they defended their homeland between 1914 and 1918. It was amassed by a viscount in the Armoured Cavalry Branch . of the French Army, who left behind several boxes containing more than . 600 plates taken by an unknown photographer.

He was employed as staff officer for French General Joseph Joffre and as part of his duties travelled along the front visiting troops. It is not known how he came upon the images, previously . unseen by the general public, but they appear to document life around the front during . World War One. The collection was found in an attic by a relative of Paris-based Reuters photographer Charles Platiau, who described them in a blog post. Mr Platiau said: 'Fortunately . most of the plates have indications of the location and date when they . were taken, which have helped us identify people and sites when . captioning the photos. 'I checked the information written on the plates with documents available from public sources to verify their accuracy. 'In . my opinion, even if the photographs are not the best of the actual . conflict, many of them document the vision that the generals and . politicians wanted to present of the war – they show resting soldiers . who were well-fed, well-housed and well-treated. 'As . I look at these plates, I think of my own ancestors who fought at . Verdun and wonder how many soldiers in these photographs survived the . battle. I wonder if some of these soldiers were killed days after being . photographed.' The photographs do not show casualties, but they do show the reality of life in the trenches: mud, shell-holes, make-shift defences and the imminent prospect of death. They also show the soldiers' sense of humour: a bath-house offers 'free massages for ladies' and the board outside calls it a 'thermal spa', while a dug-out is called 'the chalet'. And it shows that some aspects of French life were unaffected by the war, with the soldiers going to mass in one scene, and in another, Genral Joffre, the French commander in chief awards medals with a kiss on the cheek. The scene is at Verdun and in the background is the road to the battleground which became known as 'the sacred way' because of the scale of sacrifice of French troops there. It has been calculated that every square centimetre of ground was hit by four shells. French officers inspecting trenches on the Argonne front, eastern France, in May 1916 .

"Two days before a series of shootings in Canada's capital, the nation's national security agencies elevated their alert level in response to specific threats from ISIS – the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham – and a confirmed jihadi car attack that killed one soldier and injured another. Martin Couture Rouleau, a 25-year-old Muslim convert, mowed down the military men in a parking lot after lying in wait for them for two hours. Canadian Police shot him dead after a high-speed chase. In Ottawa on Wednesday morning, a gunman killed a Canadian soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial; minutes later police reportedly chased him in the the halls of Parliament where he fired dozens more shots, injuring three people. The parliamentary sergeant-at-arms shot the assailant dead. It's unclear whether the attack was related to ISIS or the larger global Islamist movement. A friend of Rouleau, the homicidal driver who died Monday, told reporters that he had acted in response to an October 13 ISIS directive calling on its foot soldiers to mount attacks 'in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The RCMP has been on elevated alert since Monday when a Muslim convert deliberately ran over two soldiers, killing one of them . The gunman killed a soldier at Canada's War Memorial . 'The citizens of crusader nations should be targeted wherever they can be found,' the group wrote in its glossy magazine, 'Dabiq.' The friend told The Toronto Star that 'he wanted to be a martyr. ... The caliphate called all the Muslims on earth to fight. He listened to what they had to say and he did his part here.' The directions Rouleu followed did not name Canada as a specific country where Islamists should mount attacks. But it did call it 'very important that attacks take place in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State. ... The citizens of crusader nations should be targeted wherever they can be found.' Separately, on Sept. 21 ISIS released a video message that singled out Canada and three other nations. 'If you can kill a disbelieving American or European – especially the spiteful and filthy French – or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be,' the message read in an English translation. The same video urged Muslims to 'strike their police, security and intelligence members, as well as their treacherous agents.' That command let the Ontario Provincial Patrol to put all its officers on high alert. A bulletin to its personnel warned that 'this demonstrates clear intention to target, kill and decapitate frontline officers and that prior planning was involved.' Indications of potential terror ties surfaced on Twitter in the hours following Wednesday's attacks in Canada. Fox News reported that a translation of one tweet reads: 'soldiers of #Islamic_state who are everywhere around the globe [have] declared war on the coalition countries.' America's neighbor to the north found itself in the ISIS crosshairs shortly after agreeing to participate in the multinational anti-terror coalition. Shops in downtown Ottawa, Canada were on lockdown throughout the morning as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police secured the crime scene and interviewed witnesses . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the White House wasn't in a position to classify the shootings as terror-related . Canada raised its terror threat level just two days ago after a jihadi ran down two soldiers – killing one – and then was shot and killed by police following a high-speed chase .

Six Canadian warplanes departed for the Iraq combat mission Tuesday as this country joins the air campaign against Islamic State militants. The CF-18 Hornets will be directly involved with offensive strikes in Iraq. In the U.S. on Wednesday, the FBI quickly directed field offices to raise their threat levels. Canada's embassy in Washington, D.C. was locked down. And President Obama had a brief phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. 'Obviously, we're all shaken by it,' Obama told reporters later in the day. 'But we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're standing side by side with Canada during this difficult time.' 'It's very important I think for us to recognize that, when it comes to dealing with terrorist activity, that Canada and the United States have to be entirely in sync,' Obama said, speaking from the famed Oval Office. But he cautioned that 'we don't have enough information yet' to determine the motive behind the deadly shooting. 'So as we understand better exactly what happened, this obviously is something that we'll make sure to factor in the ongoing efforts we have to counter terrorist attacks in our country.' Obama visited the Canadian parliament just weeks after his first inauguration in 2009. He noted Wednesday that the news hit him personally. 'I'm very familiar with that area and am reminded how warmly I was received,' he said, 'and how wonderful the people there were.' Asked if the Ottawa attacks were an ISIS operation, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that he was 'not in a position to render judgment' on the 'tragic situation.'","The RCMP already had Canada on elevated alert because of a fatal jihadi attack just two days earlier .

"Chelsea and Arsenal's hopes of signing Sami Khedira suffered a blow after Carlo Ancelotti insisted the German midfielder would not be leaving Real Madrid this season. Despite the World Cup winner's contract expiring at the end of the season, Ancelotti is desperate to keep Khedira at the Bernabeu - although the Champions League holders are reportedly willing to listen to offers of £10million. Both London clubs have been linked with moves for the 27-year-old, with Chelsea understood to be willing to offer him a lucrative pre-contract before signing him on a free transfer next summer - while Arsenal could prepare another bid in January. Sami Khedira (L) trains with Real Madrid teammates as he continues to recover from a knee injury . Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti insists that the German will not be allowed to leave this season . However, Ancelotti has ruled out a mid-season move in the hope he can convince Khedira to stay, despite the player rejecting two offers of a new contract. The Italian coach told the Evening Standard: 'We have until June to reach an agreement with him. If he wants to sign an extension, the club will renew him. If not, he will leave the team at the end of the season.' The German World Cup winner has rejected two offers of a new deal to stay at the Bernabeu . As well as their recent touchline histrionics, Arsene Wenger (L) and Jose Mourinho (R) could soon be fighting over the signature of Khedira . Khedira was not used during Real Madrid's 5-0 victory at Levante on Saturday as he continues to recover from a knee injury that has sidelined him since September, but he could be in contention for Wednesday's Champions League clash with Liverpool. 'Khedira has come back really well, he trained with the squad and he's ready to play. Of course he's not in optimal condition after missing the last 40 days, but he's an important player for us,' added Ancelotti.","Sami Khedira is wanted by Premier League clubs Arsenal and Chelsea .

"A judge on Thursday sentenced a former Colorado sheriff to 15 months in prison for repeatedly violating his probation in a meth-for-sex case, saying the lawman, who was once regarded as a hero, had exhausted his opportunities to reform. Patrick Sullivan was sentenced two years after pleading guilty to plying young men with methamphetamine in exchange for sexual favors. The 71-year-old was once named the nation's top sheriff and won praise for his leadership of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department in the Denver suburbs. 'I have a drug problem, and I have had a drug problem for some time,' Sullivan said in court on Thursday, apologizing before Judge William Sylvester issued his sentence. 'I have only myself to blame.' Scroll down for video . Fallen: A one-time America's Top Sheriff, ex-sheriff Patrick Sullivan, 71, from Arapahoe County, Colorado has since been jailed in a detention center named in his honor and subsequently violated probation several times over in the meth-for-sex case . Snapped: Sullivan was once labeled a hero for his anti-drug campaigning, now he's serving time after meth bust . Sullivan was arrested in December 2011 after authorities arranged a sting that revealed he was trading methamphetamine for sex. Months earlier, a 911 caller reported Sullivan was at his house trying to get three recovering addicts back on drugs. He later pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine and solicitation of a prostitute. Sylvester sentenced him to 30 days in jail and two years' probation. The courtroom erupted in applause on Thursday as deputies handcuffed Sullivan and took him into custody, though some had hoped for a harsher sentence. Sullivan told the judge he was benefiting from an in-patient drug treatment program he recently enrolled in after missing or failing dozens of drug tests. Hauled away: Patrick pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine and solicitation of a prostitute in 2012 and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and two years' probation. He served his term in the since renamed Sullivan Detention Center in Colorado . Overhauled: After Sullivan was caught in a meth-for-sex sting, he was placed in . the prison bearing his name; a commission voted unanimously to change . it . What's in a name? The jail was named after Sullivan in 2002, the year after he was named the nation's top sheriff . But his . probation officer, Hallie Miller, said his purported efforts to reform . were a front, and he continued to lie and make excuses for his risky . behavior. He blamed positive meth tests on everyone from a doctor who . prescribed him pills to a neighbor who he said drugged him at a . barbecue, Miller said. In January, Sullivan left the state without permission. In May, he tested positive again for meth. 'He sees himself as above the law,' Miller said. Before . his arrest, Sullivan was known as an anti-drug crusader with a record . so distinguished the county named its jail after him. The National . Sheriffs' Association tapped him as its 'top sheriff' in 2001, and he . continued to command respect even after he resigned the following year . to oversee security for a school district. Meth-for-sex: Footage from the sting shows the former sheriff trying to get a friend to buy meth, but only if the friend has sex with him . Friendly: Sullivan appears to get more and more comfortable in the footage as he strips to an undershirt, offers the friend a pair of underwear and lounges on the friend's bed . Bad leg: Police rushed in to nab Sullivan as the friend appeared to cover his face. Sullivan easily complied but asked that the police respect his bad leg . In 1989, Sullivan was hailed as a hero. During a gunman's rampage, he rescued two deputies after crashing his truck through a fence and protected them while they were loaded into the vehicle. But his court case revealed a darker picture. He would develop relationships with vulnerable young men, help them find jobs and get out of jail, and then provide them the drug. Unlike other addicts, Sullivan was 'on the forefront in the 1990s as one of the most vocal critics of the meth epidemic,' said First Assistant Attorney General Robert Shapiro. 'He of all people, the first time he tried it, knew it was nothing more than a poison. ... Mr. Sullivan chose this substance for no good reason whatsoever.' His attorney, Kevin McGreevy, argued he had been unfairly scrutinized by probation officers because of his position. Some who had worked with him hoped that probation would let him redeem his tarnished image. 'I'm not shocked anymore,' former Boulder County Sheriff George Epp said Wednesday. 'What it tells me is a switch flipped somehow and it hasn't flipped back.'","Patrick Sullivan was once considered an anti-drug crusading hero as the Arapahoe County, Colorado Sheriff .

"Healthcare company Allergan who produce Botox are looking to release Latisse - a product to boost weak eyelashes - in UK . Has already been used by over 4m people in America, Canada and India . Works to help Trichotillomani which causes her to pull her eyelashes out . Claims to make lashes 18% darker and 25% longer in just eight weeks . It's coming: The people behind Botox are creating a product to help boost eyelash growth . When Botox became available as a beauty treatment six years ago it was hailed by many as nothing short of a miracle. A-listers such as Simon Cowell, Nicole Kidman and Sharon Osbourne have admitted to trying the popular treatment that promises to turn back time in just one session. And now the people behind the face-freezing phenomenon are focusing on developing a product to boost our eyelashes. Healthcare company Allergan have . developed a product called Latisse, which is described as 'a . prescription treatment for hypotrichosis (inadequate or not enough . lashes) to grow eyelashes longer, fuller, darker.' It . was first discovered when it's main ingredient bimatropost, which was . used to treat glucoma (where high pressure in the eye damages nerves), . notably increased growth and thickness of eyelashes as a side-effect. Now, . the new product which contains bimatropost, has already been used by . over 4million women in American, India and Canada and is currently being . tested out by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory . Agency approval process, reports Sunday Times Style magazine. Loss of lashes is often common in older women and that is where Latisse works well because it slows down eyelash loss. It is also great for people who, like The Only Way is Essex star Sam Faiers, suffer Trichotillomania - a disorder which causes people to pull out their real eyelashes. And it appears to work. Research has proven that it doubles eyelash thickness and makes lashes 18 per cent darker and 25 per cent longer in just eight weeks after being swept onto the lashes once daily like an eyeliner. Useful: The Only Way is Essex star Sam Faiers who suffer Trichotillomania - a disorder which causes people to pull out their real eyelashes- could benefit from the product . The way it works is with an active ingredient called bimatoprost, which is one of the first chemicals to show promised hair growth. 'Latisse Is 0.93% bimatoprost, an eye drop liquid that is used to treat hypotrichosis which is a reduced growth of hair in a specific area. 'It is used topically on the affected area and over about 16 weeks, boosts hair growth. 'Bimatoprost is usually used for glaucoma treatment in higher concentrations. However, it may have unpleasant side effects. Hence it's use is strictly by prescription,' said Raina Zarb Adami, one of Allergan's county ambassadors. Fan: Simon Cowell admits to using Botox so could he be tempted by the latest craze? Get the look: It even works on eyebrows so you could get the Cara Delevingne heavy brow look . On the company's website, side effects are cited as: 'Increased brown pigmentation of the colored part of the eye which is likely permanent.' It also states: 'Eyelid skin darkening may occur and may be reversible. Hair may grow on skin that Latisse frequently touches. Common side effects are itchy and red eyes.' Another downside is the price and at £80-£100 for a month's supply, it doesn't come cheap. Also. if discontinued, lashes gradually return to their previous appearance. Alex Karidis, Cosmetic Surgeon to the stars, said: 'This product is very effective and I do think it will be big in the UK because which women don't want fuller eyelashes? 'Most women use false eyelashes and appreciate longer lashes so I think it will appeal brilliantly. 'There have been some known side effects but these can be minimised by applying it accurately. 'It even works on eyebrows.' Cara Delevingne watch out.","Healthcare company Allergan who produce Botox are looking to release Latisse - a product to boost weak eyelashes - in UK .

"Sergio Aguero's attempts to follow compatriot Diego Maradona by scoring his own 'glove of God' backfired as the Manchester City striker's handball subterfuge was spotted, punished and left him public enemy number one at Stoke's raucous Britannia Stadium. Despite putting in a match-winning performance for his title-chasing side and his first goals since December 3, Aguero will be remembered for something other than an impressive return to form following a knee injury. True, he didn't try to con the referee with an over-the-top celebration as Maradona did when he rose above Peter Shilton to score the first goal against England at the 1986 World Cup with his palm. Sergio Aguero (16) handled the ball into the net in similar fashion to fellow Argentinian Maradona . The goal was disallowed by referee Lee Mason and Aguero became the target for boo's from the Stoke fans . The City striker could have headed it in following good work from David Silva but put the ball in with his hand . Aguero's goal was reminiscint of the 'hand of God' goal scored by Argentinian compatriot Diego Maradona . Nevertheless, the striker did clearly use the fingers inside his gloved left hand for a final touch on a goal that would have put Manchester City 2-1 ahead on the stroke of half-time. As Manchester City players loudly acclaimed the goal awarded by referee Lee Mason, a sheepish Aguero kept quiet as Stoke players vented angry protests, particularly from Marc Muniesa, the defender closest to the action. In the end, Mr Mason was persuaded to consult with his assistant and having clearly gleaned the correct information, disallowed the goal. Stoke City's Glenn Whelan (left) confronts Aguero following the incident at the Britannia Stadium . The 26-year-old (16) was then booked by Mason for his misdemeanor despite his arguments . Aguero wasn't allowed to forget his indiscretion by the Stoke fans, regarded as among the most partisan in the Premier League. When the whistle blew for half-time with the score still at 1-1 moments later, every step he took towards the dressing-room was greeted with widespread boos and the occasional howl of abuse. The odd thing is Aguero didn't even need to handle to score. Silva's low cross flipped up in the air and Muniesa tried to intercept, Aguero's first touch with his head was goalbound but only a yard from goal his left arm seemed to involuntarily move up and his hand gave the ball a final shove. Presumably the forward will claim he couldn't get his hand out the way but even so he will now go alongside other South American greats Luis Suarez and Maradona. Silva and Aguero celebrate his goal before realising the referee's decision to disallow it . Of course, Aguero's sleight of hand won't be remembered in 30 years time like Maradona's because it was ruled out and didn't prove decisive in any case – largely because he scored twice anyway. Aguero had failed to find the net since returning from a knee injury sustained against Everton but a cold Wednesday night in Stoke proved the time to put the cobwebs away. City's goal to open the scoring after half-an-hour was brilliant. Aguero outmuscled Muniesa on the halfway line to collect a punt from James Milner, accelerated past Phil Bardsley and shot cleanly across Asmir Begovic. Aguero (right) was impressive throughout and scored a splendid double to help City to victory . Peter Crouch then equalised with a trademark header past Joe Hart to deservedly level the scoreline. Milner then headed the visitors in front and when Manchester City were awarded a penalty, Aguero rifled it into the roof of the net for his 21st goal of the season. Stoke fans might not like him but his own fans chanted 'Sergio, Sergio' as he made way for Edin Dzeko with the game won. The exciting thing for City is Aguero can only get better with new signing Wilfried Bony due to line up alongside him in their next game in 10 days time. Barcelona, who await in the Champions League, will be worried. Even without his hands, Aguero is deadly.

"The Django Unchained actress who accused police of racially profiling her for kissing her boyfriend in public has refused to apologize - despite calls from civil rights activists. Daniele Watts claimed she was harassed by the Los Angeles Police Department, who arrested her as she made out with Brian James Lucas in a car parked on the street last week. However, police maintained there was no racial element to the incident, prompting civil rights experts to accuse the actress of 'crying wolf' to cover her own back. But despite the backlash, Watts last night refused to apologize for her comments in a statement. Scroll down for videos . 'Crying wolf': Daniele Watts is pictured sobbing next to an officer from the Los Angeles Police Department, who arrested her as she made out with her boyfriend, Brian James Lucas, in a car parked on the street last week . Couple: Police maintain there was no racial element to the incident, while civil rights experts have accused the actress of 'crying wolf' to cover her own back. Above, Watts is pictured with Lucas before the incident . Although she made no mention of race in the document, sent via her publicist, Watts maintained that she was not obligated to present identification to police. She said: 'It is a constitutional right that we do not have to present ID to any member of law enforcement unless we are being charged with a crime.' Watts and Lucas were questioned last week by officers investigating a report of lewd conduct. Watts, who is black, refused to provide identification and was briefly handcuffed until police identified her. An audio recording, obtained by MailOnline, reveals the hysterical actress confronting police in a heated exchange during which she uses the N-word, and claims legal expertise from her experience playing a cop on TV. The fallout from the incident led to prominent civil rights activists decrying Watts in public and saying that she was harming their cause. Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President Earl Ofari Hutchinson, who initially rallied behind Watts, told reporters: 'I for one was very outspoken about it. Silver screen: Last night, Watts refused to apologize for her comments in a statement that was sent via her publicist. Above, the actress as Coco in Django Unchained (left) and speaking with officers in handcuffs (right) 'We take racial profiling very seriously. It's not a play thing. It's not trivial.' But he said that, in this instance, there was a 'provable cause' for Watts's detention, explaining: 'You must have your facts. You can't rush to judgment. If you do that, you have no credibility.' According to NBC, he added: 'It's like crying wolf - after a while, it has no meaning.' Project Islamic Hope President Najee Al also spoke out against the actress, who played Coco in the 2012 film Django Unchained. He told CBS: 'She should be embarrassed She's the one that told the lie. She came and stated she's a victim of racial profiling. We found out later on based on new information that she wasn't.' 'I played a copy on TV!' Watts played police cadet Angela Mullen (pictured) in the Showtime comedy 'Weeds'. In her statement, she maintained that she was not obligated to present identification to police when they asked . The newly-unearthed audio file came shortly after still images showed Watts straddling Lucas in a parked car. Recordings captured the moment that police slapped handcuffs on Watts after she walked away from an officer who asked to see her identification. Watts and the officers involved disputed whether her ID card was necessary, followed by Watts bringing her acting experience into the fray. In the audio recording, Watts sobs after being cuffed. An officer can be heard trying to calm her down. Under fire: Watts, pictured with her boyfriend, has come under fire from civil rights activists due to her claims . Attacks: Watts did not get an easy ride on social media, as the above tweet by radio host Larry Elder shows . She tells him through tears: 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me. 'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' Sgt Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend. Sgt Parker said he's witnessed first hand many of the department's most dramatic moments - including the 1992 riots over the beating of black motorist Rodney King and the 1997 North Hollywood shoot out. Offended: Sgt Jim Parker (pictured), a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Miss Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend . Throughout his career, he says he has watched the LAPD become dramatically more sensitive to race relations and diversity. Watts and Lucas maintain they were doing nothing wrong - and that they were only making out, not having sex. Sgt Parker said he fears that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers. 'She picked the wrong person to make a public incident out of a private matter,' he said. The LAPD has said it is conducting a review of the officers' behavior, but all three remain on the streets. A spokesman yesterday said the department had no response to Watts's statement. The actress's publicist, Bill McCoy, said she is not planning to take further action.","Police stopped Daniele Watts and boyfriend after reports of lewd conduct .

"In one of the more memorable scenes of the iconic 1980 film ‘The Blues Brothers,’ the title characters drive through shopping mall with police not far behind as shocked shoppers run for safety and the whole place ends up trashed. Throughout the madcap chase, deadpan stars Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi calmly point out stores like Disco Pants and Haircuts and an unrecognizable Pier One Imports. They leave behind them a completely wrecked suburban shopping center and that’s how the place stayed forever after. Failed: Built in 1966 and closed after only 13 years, Harvey, Illinois's Dixie Square Mall became memorable for good reasons and bad . Or at least almost forever after. According to Jalopnik, the memorable moment took place in Harvey, Illinois’s Dixie Square Mall. And after Hollywood left it in shambles, they left town without even cleaning it up. A reader called Jonrev, who appears to have personally documented the mall’s skeletal afterlife as well as its demolition, told the automotive blog the mall had actually closed down in 1979. Hilarious: Aykroyd's character (right) notes dryly to John Belushi's (left), 'Lots of space in this mall,' in the indelible scene from the classic movie . Iconic: The suburban behemoth was the perfect setting for an indoor car chase in the 1980 classic . The 800,000 square foot behemoth had only been built 13 years prior, in 1966 on top of what was once a golf course. A spike in crime in the area caused it to shut down just before director John Landis dressed it up for the famous scene and left without picking up after himself. ‘Once the crew left,’ wrote Jonrev, ‘(the mall in a disastrous state that was never repaired, despite a lawsuit that was ultimately tossed), the mall was briefly used as a school, then left to rot from 1981 onward.’ What was once a sprawling, $25 million mall with three anchor stores and over 60 merchants total became a ‘bombed out shell.’ Trashed: The mall was dressed up then wrecked for the scene and left that way for over 20 years by the movie crew and director John Landis . 'Bombed-Out Shell': The 800,000 square foot mall was closed due to a crime spike in the area and quickly went from suburban dream to crime riddled nightmare . Dangerous: The mall, seen here in its heyday, had 4 anchor stores at 60 merchants but became a magnet for gang activity in its decline . For around 20 years, the hot bed of gang activity and vandalism sat untouched. By 2003, Dixie Square had become a favorite of photographers and blogs like Dead Malls who were fascinated by the monument to the suburban dream turned rotting nightmare. After at least one murder, a rape, arsons, roof collapses, and a failed $76 million redevelopment attempt, the Chicago suburb had enough of its infamous landmark. The mall was torn down in 2012 using $4 million in disaster relief funds given to the state of Illinois after Hurricane Ike, to be replaced by stand-alone shopping retail stores and restaurants. Failed: Several attempts were made at revitalizing the mall, including a $76 million attempt in 2006, but all of them failed . No more: By 2003, the mall had become a favorite of photographers and bloggers. It was finally torn down in 2012 .","Dixie Square Mall, one of the first of many more to come in suburban America, began as a bustling center of commerce but went bust after only 13 years .

"With the roars of the crowd and all of Britain in his ears, Andy Murray, Britain's first Men's Wimbledon Champion in 77 years, climbed into the stands to shake hands and share the moment with everyone who made it possible. In a Wimbledon tradition, Murray climbed into the player’s box where he first hugged coach Ivan Lendl, then girlfriend Kim Sears, along with other members of his team, but he then turned to climb back down to the court - completely forgetting his mother directly behind him. His gaffe was brought to his attention and he quickly ran over to Judy Murray, 53, and gave Britain's proudest mother a hug and a kiss, to the delight of the wildly cheering crowd.

Her joy and pride was plain for all to see as she beamed at her son, after so much pressure, so many dashed hopes, fulfilled the dream of Britons everywhere. She broke down in tears and could be heard to say 'finally' as she hugged other supporters in the box. She said: 'It's the best feeling ever to see your son win Wimbledon. 'This is what he has talked about winning since he was a little boy, it was a dream that has become a reality now for him.' Murray admitted she found it hard to watch her son's triumph. Stalwart: Judy Murray has been behind her son every step of the tournament . 'I have been shaking for the last three hours,"" she added. Should Andy Murray be given a knighthood for winning Wimbledon? Should Andy Murray be given a knighthood for winning Wimbledon? Now share your opinion . 'I am fine now but 15 minutes ago (just before Murray won) I was an emotional wreck. 'I can't remember exactly what happened. I know he was 40-0 up in the last game and then it went to deuce, but he gutsed it out. 'There were some outrageous points in the final game. 'They had been out there for three hours and it was so hot, but he was so determined to win it.' Murray was seeded second for the tournament behind Djokovic, but his mother always suspected her son would go on to become the first British man since Fred Perry to triumph at the All England Club. 'I had a good feeling,' she said. Victors: Judy Murray grins as her son rewrites the history books (left).

'You have to play your A game to win and Andy brought a pretty decent game today.' After her moment with her son she was congratulated by the parents of his vanquished opponent Novak Djokovic. The Murray matriarch has passionately supported her son throughout the tournament, and indeed throughout his entire career. Joy: Before the match Judy Murray, was seen laughing with Ronnie Wood of The Rolling Stones and smiling, but during the game she admits she was an 'emotional wreck' She has also brought . laughter to the BBC commentary box by light-heartedly flirting with a . presenter earlier in the tournament. For her son’s last two matches, Judy . Murray, 53, has sat with Radio 5 Live’s George Riley, most recently in . the players’ box on Centre Court. They were seen giggling, whispering and sharing a bag of sweets. And they have also been exchanging jokey Twitter messages. In February she revealed she has been the victim of hate mail sent by fans of her son. Critics describe her as a constant domineering presence, a woman who refuses to cut the apron strings. Even tennis legend Boris Becker has joined in, blaming her attendance for her son losing last year’s final of the Australian Open.

"Once a symbol of the golden age of air travel, a Douglas Super DC-3 airplane lies hollow and forgotten on a deserted black beach in Iceland - untouched since it crashed more than four decades ago. The United States Navy cargo plane is now no more than a husk - dented and bruised by 41 punishing years of arctic gales and rain. Its tail and wings are gone and its windows are all smashed in since it was forced to crash land on Sólheimasandur beach on Saturday November 24 1973. Amazingly, the crew all survived the impact, but the plane was abandoned rather than recovered, meaning the weather-beaten remains are still standing at the crash site. These incredible shots of the aircraft were taken by Eric Cheng, 38, photographer and director of aerial imaging at drone manufacturer DJI, who visited with his wife Pam.

'My wife is a huge airplane buff, so it was pretty clear that I had to find it so I could show it to her.' The exact reason for the crash is not known, although some sources suggest the plane simply ran out of fuel after the pilot switched to the wrong fuel tank. And even the date of the crash is shrouded in mystery - while the Aviation Safety Network reports that the DC-3 went down on Saturday, November 24, 1973, an Icelandic newspaper published on November 22 suggests the plane actually crashed on November 21, 1973.

The plane is located around six miles off the main road west of Vik on Sólheimasandur Beach, meaning Cheng had to hunt down GPS coordinates online and drive to the crash site in a 4x4. 'Once we left the main road, it was about 15 minutes of driving on a huge black-sand beach, which was pretty incredible in itself,' the San Diego-born snapper said.

Alien landscape: Eric said the terrain in Iceland is otherworldly and felt as if he was 'roaming around on alien landscapes' 'The terrain in Iceland is otherworldly-often during the trip, I felt as if I were roaming around on alien landscapes. 'Finding the wreck would have been tricky without having GPS coordinates. There is mound of sand in front of it, which effectively hides the wreck until you are a couple hundred meters away. 'I felt like I was going to reach the ocean without finding it, but once we made it to the top of the mound, the wreck was suddenly there in front of us.

"Some feared Andy Murray would be scuppered by the ‘curse of Cameron’ – but it may have been lucky number seven that sent him into seventh heaven. For superstitious tennis fans were quick to observe that his victory in the men’s final at Wimbledon came 77 years after a Briton last secured the title, with Fred Perry’s success in 1936. Yesterday was of course the seventh day of the seventh month. Scroll down for video . He's done it! David Cameron roars with delight as Andy Murray clinches the championship winning point yesterday . Agony: The PM suffers with every lost point on court . And keen observers will have noted that Murray broke Novak Djokovic’s serve in the seventh game of every set. Those who pooh-pooh the concept of the lucky number might be swayed by the fact that while Murray and Djokovic are both 26, our Scottish hero was born seven days before yesterday’s loser. And surely only hardened cynics would ignore the fact that Britain’s last singles title winner, Virginia Wade, had her moment of glory in 1977. Belief that seven is a lucky number goes back centuries – while the ‘curse of Cameron’ had only gained credence in recent months. Cameron blows out his cheeks as the tension mounts... but is soon gripped again . Phew: He wipes away away a tear as mother Mary looks on . The Prime Minister had been accused of being a bad omen after his hopes of victory heralded failure for sports stars including female tennis player Laura Robson, cyclist Mark Cavendish and diver Tom Daley. He sent his best wishes to British number one Laura Robson, 19, shortly before her fourth-round exit last week. But Mr Cameron defied those begging him to stay away from this year’s final by sitting in the Royal Box at Centre Court and  clapping enthusiastically at every point Murray won. Before the match Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the whole country has been incredibly impressed, not just with his skill but with his courage and his mental courage in coming through to the final yet again. ‘The whole country is right behind you Andy – go for it.’ Murray had defended Mr Cameron’s good luck messages and seemed unperturbed by the ‘Jonah’ Premier being present.","PM's jinx may have been lifted by the mystical power of the number seven .

"Andy Murray will be recommended for a knighthood for ending Britain’s 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men’s title, it emerged last night. Downing Street sources indicated that the Government would pass his name to the Honours Committee because he had matched the achievement of cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who was knighted for winning the Tour de France – Britain’s first victory in the event’s 100-year history. As it emerged the Queen had sent a private message of congratulations to the triumphant Scot, David Cameron further fuelled speculation Murray would be awarded a knighthood with the remark: 'I can't think of anyone who deserves one more.'

Sheer relief: Andy Murray collapses to his knees after beating Novak Djokovic in three straight sets . A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘I . can confirm that the Queen has sent a private message to Andy Murray . following his Wimbledon victory.’ David Cameron, who watched the match from the Royal Box, is a tennis fan and is understood to support plans for ‘Sir Andy’. Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, another keen tennis player, said he would also back a knighthood. Murray was awarded an OBE in the New Year’s honours list for services to tennis after he won Olympic gold and triumphed at the US Open last October.

She can't believe it: Kim Sears was ecstatic as Murray won the championship point at the end of an action-packed Wimbledon men's singles final . A jubilant Mr Cameron – who was previously accused of cursing  British sporting performances – compared Murray’s achievement with Britain’s golden Olympic summer of 2012, which also saw knighthoods awarded to cycling team boss Sir Dave Brailsford and sailor Sir Ben Ainslie. He said: ‘It was fantastic, it was an absolutely brilliant performance, an amazing day for Andy Murray but also an incredible day for British tennis and for Britain. ‘He was magnificent. In the Royal Box we were jumping up and down. It felt like the Olympics.’ The Prime Minister added: ‘It felt like one of those moments when the whole country is watching and there is just an amazing sportsman who’s dedicated his life and had wanted to win so badly and then just producing a performance that was exquisite.’ Sportsmanship and glory: Murray is congratulated by Novak Djokovic of Serbia after their hard-fought battle .

"North Korea has a notoriously sullied human rights record but following the Ferguson protests earlier this week they described the United States as 'a tundra of human rights.' A foreign ministry spokesperson cited the Ferguson protests, in which a police officer was not charged for shooting an unarmed black teenager, and said it is evidence of racist America. 'This is clear proof of the real picture of the US as a tundra of human rights, where extreme racial discrimination acts are openly practiced,' said the spokesman to North's official KCNA news agency. Scroll down for video . Condemning America: North Korea, lead by controversial figure Kim Jong-Un, has called the United States a 'tundra of human rights' following the racially charged Ferguson protests . This statement comes just one week after the UN pushed the Security Council to take North Korea and leaders like Kim Jong-Un to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for an indictment on crimes against humanity. The resolution is drafted by both Japan and the European Union and states that North Korea's human rights abuses are 'without parallel in the contemporary world.' Pyongyang has struck back at the resolution and said they were controlled by the US to humiliate leader Kim Jong-Un . 'The great irony is that the US tries to measure other countries with its wrong human rights standard, though it is a typical human rights abuser,' the foreign ministry spokesman said.

"A 15-year-old boy accused of helping the alleged killer of two female police officers claims he's innocent. The boy was held on suspicion of assisting Dale Cregan after officers swooped on his school on Friday. He was interviewed for six hours before being bailed and is due to be questioned again next week. Scroll down for video . Court sketch: As one of Britain's most-protected suspects Cregan, with a beard and his Onyx left eye, stood in the court today absolutely swamped by police, including some with machine guns . Crowd: Cregan was rushed into Manchester Magistrates' Court in this van (centre) morning sandwiched by a fleet of six police vehicles . Standing guard: Officers armed with machine guns stood in the rainy dank conditions as Cregan was swept to face magistrates . Cregan, 29, appeared in court on Friday charged with the murders of Pc Fiona Bone, 32, and Pc Nicola Hughes, 23. The boy was arrested at 2.30pm as he sat in a class at his school, in Hattersley. He was handcuffed in the corridor in front of stunned classmates before being taken away by three plain-clothes officers. The boy told the Manchester Evening News that he couldn't understand why he'd been arrested. Dale Cregan will spend the weekend at Manchester’s infamous Strangeways prison (above). His . police van sped him to the jail only a mile away from the magistrates . court in central Manchester that he appeared before this morning. The judge told him he would be remanded in custody and will appear at the crown court on Monday, where he could ask for bail. Its . famous design has a central snowflake shaped building, with two blocks . and ten wings of cells running from it with a famous giant watchtower . rising upwards. It has . housed various infamous killers who have appeared at Manchester . Magistrates Court and were remanded in custody there to await trial. Ian Brady, the Moors Murder was held there as was ‘Dr Death’ Harold Shipman. Strangeways . has more than 1,200 prisoners and was originally built in 1868. It was . also one of the first in Britain to have permanent gallows, used to hang . more than 100 people up until 1964. Many were buried in the grounds of . the prison in unmarked graves. Much of the prison was damaged or destroyed during riots by inmates there in 1990 (above) Between . April 1 and April 25 almost 150  and 47 prisoners were injured - . including one death  among the prisoners. It needed £80m of Government . cash to rebuild it and Strangeways was then renamed Her Majesty’s . Prison, Manchester. He added: 'I was scared. I didn't know what was going to happen to me and I still don't know why they'd want to arrest me.' The boy's father added that he wanted to 'get to the bottom' of why he'd been arrested. Assistant Chief Constable Garry . Shewan, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'We have arrested a . 15-year-old on suspicion of assisting an offender. 'This remains a complex and sensitive . investigation and we continue to ask the public to search their . conscience and urge anyone who has any information to contact us.' In court on Friday, there were only a . few paces between the door to the cells and his place in the dock, but . Dale Cregan still managed to walk them with a swagger. Five policemen stood so close to him . they were almost touching, and four more carrying sub-machine guns . watched him constantly from the well of the crowded court. This . was the one-eyed murder suspect’s first appearance before a judge after . being arrested over the savage deaths of two policewomen. He marked it . with a yawn. It happened just before the first mention of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in  the charges that were being read to him. He glanced around the room with his one good eye. Every police officer stared back. In . one of the biggest security operations ever mounted for a magistrates’ court appearance, the man whose face had appeared on wanted posters and . billboards around Manchester was finally seen in public. He had a full beard now and looked . considerably thinner than in that now-familiar photograph. The false eye . was the same – an onyx one in his left eye socket, giving him a . pronounced squint. In a tight-fitting, dark blue . sweatshirt  and tracksuit trousers, he had the appearance of a . bodybuilder – but compared to  the burly officers who surrounded him . behind half inch-thick glass in the dock, he looked tiny. There was a seat in the dock and he went straight towards it and sat down. Instantly, . the judge told him to stand. He spoke only once to confirm his name and . date of birth and stood mostly with his unshackled hands folded in . front of him. Two minutes later, it was all over. The . comparatively low-key performance of the man accused of two murders . that horrified the nation was in dramatic contrast to the operation . deemed necessary to bring him to Manchester city magistrates. The . two policewomen were mown down in a gun and grenade attack on Tuesday, . and police had already said they could not rule out the possibility that . more grenades were in criminal hands in the city. So . on a dark, miserably wet morning, roadblocks were set up around the . court building and officers carrying Heckler and Koch carbines took up . positions inside and out. A heavily-armed convoy brought him to court in a van more than  two hours before he was due to appear. Meanwhile in a tiny courtroom on the fourth floor, every seat was taken. Among . those in the public gallery was a young man wearing a grey jacket . bearing printed portraits of Mark Short, another of Cregan’s alleged . victims, above the words ‘RIP Mark’. Driven: Police officers stand guard as Dale Cregan arrives in an armed convoy to face charges of murder and attempted murder . Visitor: Michelle Short, widow of David Short . and mother of Mark Short, was in court while another family member wore a . hoodie with a tribute to Mark on it . Sitting alongside him was Michelle Short, widow of Mark’s father David Short, who is also alleged to have been killed by Cregan. Neither . of the PCs’ families attended, according to court staff, and if any of . Cregan’s relatives or friends were in court, none was identified. Downstairs, . two officers with sub-machine guns, flak jackets and black armoured . outfits monitored everyone coming through the security search. Even . inside, they wore their jet black protective glasses. In a scene rarely witnessed in Britain, four officers brought their weapons into the courtroom and stood guard. Whatever . unseen arrangements were made to get the defendant securely into the . dock, it took more than five minutes to put them into operation after . district judge Jonathan Taaffe ordered him to be brought. Proud: Father Bryn Hughes hugs PC Nicola Hughes - who was murdered last Tuesday in a gun and grenade attack . Victim: Fiona Bone, left, with partner Clare Curran. The couple were planning their civil partnership ceremony . Convoy: Cregan, held in the police van with the blue roof, was swept quickly out of court after his hearing with huge police protection . Custody: Cregan was driven to the nearby Strangeways prison, where the gates were already open, allowing the van to speed straight into its huge complex where he will be held until Monday . Cregan was charged with four counts of murder and four of attempted murder. Apart . from the killing of the two PCs, he is accused of killing Mark Short at . the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden, Tameside, on May 25 and his father . David in an attack at his home in Clayton, Manchester, on August 10. He is further accused of attempting . to murder Michael Belcher, Ryan Pridding and John Collins, who were in . the pub at the time; and Sharon Hark on August 10. The judge ordered him to be remanded in custody and to appear at Manchester Crown Court on Monday. A police convoy duly took him to the city’s Strangeways jail to await the next stage of what is likely to be a lengthy legal process. Ten miles away on the Hattersley estate where Fiona, 32, and Nicola, 23, fell, forensic officers were still working at the scene. The floral tributes and messages of condolence continued to arrive.

"Explorers have recovered Apollo 11 engines from the Atlantic Ocean floor. First recovered in March, experts have now confirmed the rocket engines recovered from three miles below the ocean surface by Bezos Expeditions are Saturn V first stage F-1’s used by the rocket that put the first men on the moon. The announcement came one day before the 44th anniversary of Neil Armstrong’s historic first steps on the lunar surface. Found!: Explorers confirmed they have recovered engines used to put Apollo 11 on it's historic voyage to the first lunar landing . The confirmation was made by conservators from the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center, who confirmed the engines’ origin by scanning their surface with black lights designed to notice even the smallest markings. They were able to discern the serial number ‘2044’ stenciled on the side of one of the thrust chambers, according to Jeff Bezos. ‘2044 is the Rocketdyne serial number that correlates to NASA number 6044, which is the serial number for F-1 Engine #5 from Apollo 11,’ Bezos explained. Further sleuthing led the team to find ‘Unit No 2044’ stamped into the base of the thrust chamber, wrote Bezos, providing additional confirmation. The recovery was made using highly advanced Remotely Operated Vehicles designed to withstand the immense pressures brought by the extreme depths at which the engines were found. They were tethered to a vessel on the surface via fiber-optic cables used to transmit data and power, according to Bezos. Identified: The serial number 2044 from the Saturn V F-1 engines used by the Apollo 11 was found using black lights to scan the engine's surface . Remarkable discovery: More than 43 years of corrosion from being on the floor of the ocean made identifying the engines difficult . The team believes it has enough components to assemble two complete engines from the historic voyage. The recovered engines powered the Saturn V rocket for just over two minutes in actual flight time, according to Ars Technica, burning more than four and a half million pounds of fuel. Once empty, the engines detached and were returned to earth by retrorockets designed to pull them away from the climbing spacecraft and into the waters off the Florida coast. Historic: The confirmation that the engines are from Apollo 11 comes on the 44th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's moon walk . Fixer upper: Bezos said it will take significant work to restore the engines to their original glory . Apollo 11’s celebrated flight to the moon took about four days from launch to landing, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Touching down July 20, 1969 on the moon’s surface at Tranquility Base, Neil Armstrong famously announced ‘the Eagle has landed.’ Bounding out of the spacecraft a few hours later, Armstrong famously said ‘that’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.’ Buzz Aldrin soon joined Armstrong on his famous moonwalk as millions around the world watched in awe. Less than 24 hours after landing, the astronauts began their journey back to Earth, making a splash landing in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. We have liftoff: The Saturn V carrying the Apollo 11 launching from Kennedy Space Center July 16, 1969 .

"Printing your own smartphone covers, jewellery and even replacement parts for your broken washing machine at home just became a cheaper reality. Electronics store Maplin has become the first major high-street retailer in the UK to sell 3D printers and is selling the Velleman K8200 for just £700. Previously, 3D printers were mainly available online and cost from around £1,800 up to £10,000. Electronics store Maplin has become the first major high-street retailer in the UK to sell 3D printers and is selling the Velleman K8200, pictured, for £700. The printer can print smartphone covers, jewellery and even replacement parts for your broken washing machine at home using plastic . The K8200 3D printer is around the same size as a standard paper printer. It is built with an aluminium frame, and comes with Repetier software for . product design and five metres of polylactic acid (PLA) — the 3mm . plastic wire used to create the desired 3D objects. 3D printing works by melting plastic filament and creating solid objects by building them up in very fine plastic layers. 3D printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file. They work in an extremely simple way, by building up a 3D object from layers of material. Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base. Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Shoes, jewellery and even dresses have been created, with designs often sold online. Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms . allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a . replacement part for a broken household appliance. The first step is to create the 3D object design by using digital software on a computer. This design is then transmitted to the 3D printer which begins to build up the design layers in plastic. The length of time it takes to print a 3D object depends on the size and complexity of the design. For example a phone case takes around 30 minutes to print, while larger and more complicated items would take longer. The ornament, pictured left, and a mini figure of Buddha, right, were printed using Maplin's Velleman 3D printer. They were made from polyactic acid (PLA) which is the 3mm plastic wire used to create 3D objects . A 3D-printed model of a human face, pictured, printed on Maplin's Velleman K8200 printer. The printer costs £699.99 and that includes the Repetier software for product design and five metres of PLA. 3D printing works by melting plastic filament and creating solid objects by building them up in very fine plastic layers . In theory, anything that can be designed using the Repetier software can be printed using a 3D printer. According to Maplin, the only limit with the K8200 is the size of the 20cm x 20cm x 20cm printable area. Oliver Meakin, Commercial Director at Maplin, says: 'We have been excited about 3D printing technology for a long time, as its principles of innovation and creation sit perfectly with what Maplin has been doing for over 40 years. 'Until now, the cost of 3D printers limited their use to the professional market. 'However, the Velleman K8200 kit has enabled us to introduce 3D printing to the mass market. A Maplin employee, called a Maplineer, stands next to the Velleman printer and holds a 3D-printed Maplin logo. In-store Maplineers are technical experts in 3D printing and can help customers interested in buying the printer, according to a Maplin spokesman . Customers could soon design their own items, go into a supermarket and have them printed in 3D. Tesco is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores. Ideas include digitally making clothing, furniture, personal gifts and even food in their shops. The project could also see Tesco stores repair broken items or print spare parts for a product that has already been purchased. 'We selected this model primarily because it offers high performance printing at an affordable price, making it accessible to our customers. 'Our in-store Maplineers are technical experts in this field and therefore we are in a great position to assist our customers in understanding this product, which for many will be completely new. 'This is only a first step for Maplin into the world of 3D printing and we look forward to developing this category further in the future.” The Velleman K8200 3D printer kit will go on sale in selected stores this week priced at £699.99. It can also be ordered online from the Maplin website.","The Velleman K8200 is available from electronic store Maplin for £700 .

"Arsenal have opened talks with Theo Walcott over a second new contract in two years. Walcott made his first Arsenal appearance in 10 months following a serious knee injury, coming on as a late substitute in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Burnley. The England forward would enter the final year of his contract at the end of the season, a scenario Arsenal are keen to avoid, and they have held initial discussions regarding an extension. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Theo Walcott returns to Arsenal training ahead of Anderlecht . Theo Walcott, who made his injury comeback against Burnley, could be handed a new deal at Arsenal . Walcott is back in first-team training after recovering from a serious knee injury . Manager Arsene Wenger wants to pre-empt any uncertainty over Walcott’s future by signing him to a longer deal. Walcott ended a saga by signing a three-and-a-half-year extension in January 2013 worth around £90,000 per week. Just 38 appearances later, Walcott is on course for another. Wenger confirmed: ‘We are starting to sit down with him. He has one and a half years to go in December. It is never an easy job with him. 'It should be his best years from now because he is 25, so hopefully we can profit from that. ‘He is a unique player, a player who has been here a long time and who gives us something different. He has been tremendous for the last few seasons. To have him back can only be a bonus for me.’ Walcott could feature again from the bench in the Champions League clash against Anderlecht. The former Southampton man’s return to fitness comes as a huge boost to Wenger, who is without six first-teamers due to injury, including Mesut Ozil, Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy. Despite Walcott’s lack of match fitness the Arsenal manager says he is happy for him to report for international duty next week ahead of England’s clashes against Slovenia and Scotland. ‘I’m happy for him to go with England, he needs competition and games,’ said the Frenchman. ‘For us, he needs hard training. Will I use him from the bench against Anderlecht? I haven’t decided yet.’ The Arsenal winger replaced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, pictured, against Burnley on Saturday . Walcott will be hoping to feature against Anderlecht after coming on for the last 10 minutes at the weekend . Provided results go their way, Arsenal can secure their passage into the Champions League knockout stages with two games to spare by beating Anderlecht, but Wenger insists his side will not take their foot off the gas during the final two group games as they look to clinch top spot above Borussia Dortmund. Arsenal have finished second in their group in the previous two seasons, and both times they have been eliminated in the last 16 by Bayern Munich. In 2011 they also finished second and ran into a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona in the first knockout round. Wenger is determined to reduce the chances of meeting one of Europe’s superpowers in the next round by finishing top of the group. ‘Before, we played Bayern twice, we played Barcelona as well,’ said Wenger. ‘It is always better you finish first because in some way you feel guilty if you don’t finish first and you think, if you are punished, it is down to you because you finished second. ‘Let’s do the job against Anderlecht and then we will see. I believe every win makes you strong and every defeat makes you weaker, so no matter what happens we will try to play until the end. 'It will be satisfying for me to qualify after four games, it will be job done. We want to take that opportunity, we are on a good run and we want to take advantage of that. Arsene Wenger has revealed he wouldn't stop Walcott linking up with Roy Hodgson's England  later this month . Jack Wilshere . Laurent Koscielny . David Ospina . Mesut Ozil . Mathieu Debuchy . Oliver Giroud . ‘They gave us a tough game in the first match. We had a bit of a miraculous win in Anderlecht, needing to go into the last minute, but that was our quality in the game. ‘We have been warned. We learned a lot from the first game and now we want to win the game at the Emirates.’ Wenger will go into Tuesday's clash without Jack Wilshere who has picked up a virus. The England international, who is also suffering from a minor knee injury, missed Monday's training session but did report to the club’s London Colney HQ. The midfielder is expected to be fit for Saturday’s clash against Swansea and for England duty next week. Wenger revealed that Aaron Ramsey has also been ill over the past few days but said that no other Arsenal players have been affected by the bug.

"Patricia Hewiston was unwittingly growing cannabis in her garden after a rogue seed from a bird feed fell and started thriving . It didn’t look out of place among the petunias in green-fingered grandmother Patricia Hewitson’s front garden. The 5ft plant had plenty of foliage, pretty patterns on the leaves, and it seemed to thrive in a spot where others had perished. There was just one problem. It was a cannabis plant. And her unwitting cultivation of such a fine specimen brought the attention of the law after she had it identified by her local radio gardening programme. Mrs Hewitson sent a picture of the mysterious plant to the BBC’s appropriately named Potting Shed, after suspecting all was not as it seemed. The show’s resident experts immediately recognised it as cannabis – and the programme dutifully forwarded the photo to police. ‘Oh dear,’ Mrs Hewitson was heard to say on air when told what she had produced. Yesterday the 65-year-old retired health visitor had chopped up the rogue plant and was preparing to dispose of it in accordance with police instructions. Mrs Hewitson and her husband John, a 70-year-old retired marine biologist, first noticed the plant in July in the front garden of their home in Exmouth, Devon. ‘It popped up between my petunias,’ Mrs Hewitson said. ‘I just left it there and it grew and grew ... and grew. ‘It was quite useful because it filled a rather difficult space, but in a couple of months it was almost as tall as I am.’ Scroll down for video . The former health visitor sent a photograph of the plant in to The Potting Shed (right) so experts may be able to identify it . The plant is thought to have sprouted from a hemp seed in an RSPB-approved mix the couple used in a bird feeder. It took root in a flower-bed less than 15ft from the pavement – in full view of passing pedestrians. None commented on what it might be (‘And no one asked me to sell them any,’ Mrs Hewitson added). But she did notice ‘a sickly sweet pong’, and became suspicious. The grandmother of five posted a picture of it on Facebook and invited friends to identify it. ‘They all said, “No, no, it’s not cannabis”, and sent me the names of all sorts of plants they thought it could be. I wanted to be sure so I emailed a photo to the Potting Shed team. ‘I don’t mind that they told the police – it actually put my mind at rest. They accepted that I wasn’t intentionally cultivating it and said I wouldn’t be prosecuted if I destroyed it. ‘I did get an email asking if they could come and look in my loft though – but I live in a flat, and I haven’t got a loft.’ Police confirmed that although an offence had been committed, there were mitigating circumstances, and no charges would be brought. Mrs Hewitson said she had no idea the plant would be able to flourish in 'dear old Devon' but had once seen it in South Africa . Cannabis plants are usually grown indoors in the UK with the help of fluorescent lamps and a controlled temperature gauge. But they can  tolerate slightly harsher conditions and will thrive as long as they remain sheltered from the elements. The growing season in the UK is rather short as cannabis is essentially a tropical plant. Cannabis is induced to flower when the daylight has reduced to about 13 hours per day. This happens  during September, but the plant has only six to 10 weeks flowering time before the first frost kills the plant. September and October can also be cold and wet, increasing the chances of fungus and disease ruining the crop. There are varieties bred especially for outdoor growing in Northern Europe, but these tend to give poorer results than the best indoor or greenhouse types. The ideal grow site should get unrestricted sun for as much of the day as possible and protection from strong winds. With excellent growing conditions, Cannabis has been known to grow six inches a day, although the rate is more commonly one to two inches. The optimum temperature is 27C to 30C, so this is possible during the height of summer in the UK. Under the advice of local police the plant has been removed and destroyed. Mrs Hewitson will not be prosecuted .

"For more than half a century James Bond has always drunk Vodka Martinis - 'shaken, not stirred'. But now Bond actor Daniel Craig has swapped his traditional beverage for a bottle of Heineken as he stars in a controversial new advert. Although the movies have long been filmed with carefully placed products, by filming a standalone advert 007 has gone a stage further.

Neither shaken, nor stirred: Bond, played by Daniel Craig, drinks a bottle of Heineken with co-star Berenice Marlohe .

Omega watch in a commercial - but now he has swapped his traditional drink to promote a lager. He is also seen drinking Heineken in the new movie out next month.

'We have relationships with a number of companies so that we can make this movie,' Daniel Craig told website Moviefone. 'The simple fact is that, without them, we couldn't do it. It's unfortunate but that's how it is. This movie costs a lot of money to make, it costs nearly as much again if not more to promote, so we go where we can.

"Nigel Farage is planning a series of appearances alongside black and ethnic minority candidates in an attempt to show Ukip is not a racist party. As more damaging details emerged about his candidates, the Ukip leader conceded that too many ‘idiots’ had slipped through the party’s vetting procedures. He said he planned to ‘fight back’ against the negative impression they had made on voters. Campaign trail: A smiling Nigel Farage in front of his party's most recent billboard advert . Two days ago it emerged that a candidate in Stockport had been suspended after calling Islam ‘evil’ and saying Pakistan should be ‘nuked’. Mr Farage said yesterday the party had ‘made mistakes’ but should not be judged by a ‘handful of people’ saying ‘idiotic things’. He insisted : ‘These people are not representative of Ukip at all. Not only am I adamant that we are a non-racist party, this week we are going to fight back against it. ‘You will see our election address for the local elections this year and you will see a lot of black ethnic minority candidates who are proudly standing for Ukip. I am going to approach this differently in future.’ Sources said Mr Farage was planning to appear alongside ethnic minority candidates, including Amjad Bashir, a business spokesman for the party, and Steven Woolfe, an economics spokesman who is of mixed race. However, he risked further controversy as he ramped up his party’s anti-immigration message in the European Parliament election campaign – saying people should be worried if immigrants from Eastern European countries moved into their neighbourhoods. Farage and Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband appear on The Andrew Marr Show. The Ukip leader conceded today too many candidates had slipped through the party vetting process . ‘The question was, you know, “If a whole load of Romanian men moved in next door to you, would you be concerned about it?”. Perhaps you would, yes,’ Mr Farage told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. He insisted the Eastern enlargement of the EU had allowed criminals to enter Britain. Liberal Democrats are braced for a wipe-out at the European elections with a poll putting them in fifth place behind the Greens. Nick Clegg has been warned his party has a chance of losing all its 12 MEPs in the elections this month, in which Ukip are widely predicted to top the poll. A big loss of seats would be a bitter disappointment for the party, especially after Mr Clegg hoped to drum up support for their pro-European position by holding two televised debates with Nigel Farage. Deputy leader Malcolm Bruce defended their policy agenda yesterday, saying it was still the party’s view that joining the euro could be in Britain’s long-term interests. The latest YouGov opinion poll puts the party on just 7 per cent of the vote, behind the Green party on 8 per cent. The Conservatives are poised to finish third with 22 per cent, Labour on 28 per cent with Ukip in the lead on 29 per cent. YouGov analysts predict the Lib Dems will keep between three and five MEPs – although there are concerns among party activists of a total wipe-out on May 22. Mr Bruce conceded Europe has ‘a lot of issues to sort out’, and that the Lib Dem 2004 manifesto claim that ‘being outside the euro would lead to job losses and reduced prosperity’ was wrong. He said Lib Dem MEPs were ‘the most hardworking’. ‘We have opened up the doors to countries that have not recovered from communism and I’m afraid it has become a gateway for organised crime. Everybody knows that. No one dares say it.’ Meanwhile, Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg repeated his call for an electoral pact between his party and Ukip, which would see each agreeing not to field candidates against each other in certain seats. He told Sky’s Murnaghan programme: ‘It is tremendously important because actually Ukip and the Conservatives both want one big thing in common and that is a totally new relationship with the European Union.’ He added that ‘both our interests are allied in doing some sort of a deal’. But Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Every party has to manage who their candidates are, I think it is pretty apparent by this stage that Ukip have not done that. They have a remarkable string of individual circumstances which add up something bigger which does lead you to have concerns about some of the people involved in that party.’ Ukip was mired in further controversy after it emerged candidate in Liverpool had suggested homosexuals are ‘ten times more likely’ than ‘normal men’ to be child abusers. Paul Forrest also said the ‘end of Islam is coming’ and that its followers who refuse to ‘turn to Christ’ will be ‘gone’. Former Labour minister David Lammy said the country was ‘on the cusp of a serious bit of self-mutilation’ in backing Ukip. ‘Many of its candidates are saying terrible things about people of colour, terrible things about people who are gay,’ he said.","Farage to make pose with black and ethnic minority candidates .

"A Dutch patient has become the first in the world to be given a total skull replacement. During a 23-hour operation the 22-year-old woman was given a 3D printed plastic skull. The customised skull was implanted by neurosurgeons Dr Bon Verweij and Dr Marvick Muradin at University Medical Centre Utrecht. A 22-year-old woman in the Netherlands has become the first person in the world to have the whole of the back of the skull replaced with a 3D printed version (pictured) The patient, who has not been named, suffered from a condition which caused her skull to become progressively thicker. This caused her to suffer from headaches and put increased pressure on the brain. In this patient’s case, it was also causing her eyesight to deteriorate and she was losing the ability to form facial expressions. Her skull was almost five inches thick while a normal skull is about one to one and a half centimetres thick. As her skull continued to thicken, the pressure on her brain continued to build and, without the surgery, she would have eventually lost crucial brain functions and died. The surgery saw neurosurgeons replace the whole of the back of her skull - from her hairline to the top of her neck and from one ear to the other. Dr Bon Verweij carried out the surgery on the patient who had a condition which caused her skull to get progressively thicker, meaning pressure was put on her brain. The surgery (pictured) was so successful that the patient is now symptom-free and has returned to work . They replaced the bone with the plastic implant which was attached to the remaining bone. The surgery went well and, three months on, the patient is completely symptom-free. She has also fully regained her sight and has returned to work. She is not expected to need further treatment. Dr Verweij said: ‘It is almost impossible to see that she’s ever had surgery.’ Doctors have previously used 3D printed implants to replace parts of the skull – but they have never before replaced the full back part of a skull. The surgeons say the technique could also be used to treat patients with severe skull injuries or tumours.","Woman had a condition that caused her skull to get progressively thicker .

"Predator: Ryan Chambers, 19, had been living in his father's flat on his own and used it as a place to have sex with the girls . A 'very dangerous and predatory' teenager who sexually abused four girls he met on Facebook has been jailed for three years and nine months. Ryan Chambers amassed the names and phone numbers of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 15 years by making flattering remarks about their profile pictures on the social networking site. The 19-year-old would bombard the girls with chat up lines in the hope they would 'rise to the bait' before inviting them round to the flat where he lived alone and have consensual sex with them. He was found guilty of eight counts of sexual activity with a child, involving four girls, after a two-and-a-half week trial and was jailed yesterday. Judge Ronald Moss heard that the 'manipulative loner' was in brief relationships with some of his victims. Judge Moss, sitting at Aylesbury Crown Court, said: 'You were in a relationship with one of the victims but not for long because you jumped from pillar to post using Facebook on a frequent manner. 'Despite your young age you are a sexual predator. What you did by using Facebook was hope that somebody would rise to the bait and would be flattered by your comments. You would then chance your arm with them. 'You flattered them, all were young under the age of 16 and somewhat immature. They welcomed you flattery and you were quite practiced in giving it.' When the girls tried to break free from the controlling relationship, Chambers would guilt trip them into staying with him, the judge said. Judge Moss added: 'You threatened to burn the house down of one of your victims if they stopped contact with you. And on more than one occasion you threatened to commit suicide yourself.' Police were alerted to Chambers by the mother of one of his 14-year-old victims who was concerned her daughter was being groomed over the internet. Predator: Ryan Chambers amassed the names and phone numbers of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 15 years by making flattering remarks about their profile pictures on the social networking site . Officers raided Chambers’ flat in June, last year, and arrested him after finding lists featuring more than 1,000 names and mobile phone numbers. Chambers had been living in his father’s flat in Akerlea Close, Milton Keynes, Bucks., on his own and used it as a place to have sex with the girls. While on bail for these offences police found Chambers at the flat with a 14-year-old girl who had been reported missing by her worried parents. He was remanded in custody and analysis of his Facebook use found he had set up 11 profiles on the site under variations of his name. They also found four videos on his mobile phone of oral sex with two of the victims. Judge Moss said: 'These offences were serious, carefully planned and caused a great deal of anxiety, not necessarily for the victims, but for their parents.' Hearing: Judge Moss, sitting at Aylesbury Crown Court, said When the girls tried to break free from the controlling relationship, Chambers would guilt trip them into staying with him . Defence counsel Nadia Chbat said Chambers’ judgement in using Facebook had been flawed. She said: 'His use of Facebook became prolific. The addictive nature of Facebook gave the illusion that these people were friends. It took bite of this young man in a catastrophic way.' He was sentenced to three years and nine months in total and was banned from using a social networking site for six years as part of a sexual offences prevention order. He was also placed on the sex offenders register for life. Speaking after the case investigating officer Detective Sergeant Sally Kestin, of the Child Abuse Investigation Unit at Thames Valley Police, said: . 'Ryan Chambers is a very dangerous and predatory young man who has a prolific desire to groom his victims in order to sexually abuse them. 'He would use a number of profiles set up on Facebook to contact girls and request they add him as a friend. 'If a girl accepted his friend request he would initiate conversations with them through Facebook as a ploy to obtain their phone numbers. 'His ultimate aim was to entice them around to his home where he would encourage them to have sex with him. 'The sheer number of girls involved meant we had to carry out a thorough and sensitive investigation, working closely with local schools and relevant agencies from MK Council, who were very supportive of our enquiries. 'We sent out a letter to more than 800 parents asking them to speak to their children to see if they had made contact with Chambers through Facebook or by text between summer 2010 and July 2011. 'We had a fantastic response from parents who were pleased police were dealing with a case like this and provided us with information crucial to our inquiry. 'As a result of the investigation we established Chambers had sexually abused four girls, all aged between 13 and 15 years old, and I would like to pay tribute to their bravery in disclosing the offences against them.'","Ryan Chambers, 19, had been living in his father’s flat in Milton Keynes, Bucks., on his own and used it as a place to have sex with the girls .

"A father has organised his own funeral, pre-booked a burial plot and made memory boxes for his young children because he has just months to live. Andrew Hickie, 42, father to James, six, and Alexandra, four, has skin cancer which has spread around his body. Yet the council worker, who is married to Victoria, 39, has vowed to remain optimistic and enjoy the limited time he has left. Heartbreaking: Andrew Hickie with son James, six, and daughter Alexandra, four, has skin cancer which has spread around his body but he's determined to enjoy the time he has left with his family . Battle: Mr Hickie, pictured with his children, was diagnosed with cancer in 2012 after an innocuous blister tucked under a toe turned out to be cancer. After it was removed he discovered the cancer had spread . He is also keen to raise awareness of the dangers of skin cancer. Mr Hickie, from Kenton Bankfoot, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'The speed of the cancer progression has been devastating for me, my family, friends and colleagues.' Skin cancer cases have soared seven-fold in the past 40 years. The shock rise is blamed on the legacy of sunshine package holidays which became popular in the 1960s. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn in their youth, experts said this week. And they warned the continuing obsession with sporting a tan will mean the toll keeps rising. Sunbeds were singled out for criticism for fuelling the huge increase in all types of skin cancer, especially among young women. New figures from Cancer Research UK show that more than 13,000 people a year develop malignant melanoma – the most deadly type of skin cancer. The total is expected to surge to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. Malignant melanoma has become the fifth most common cancer in Britain, killing more than 2,000 people a year. It is also the most common cancer in women in their 20s. If caught early, it is treatable. If it spreads, even chemotherapy has little effect. 'I remain positive about the time ahead to try and prolong my life and will enjoy every day. My main sadness is the time I will miss with my family in time to come, something one takes for granted, like walking my daughter down the aisle or seeing my son become a man.' Mr Hickie's nightmare began in August 2012 after an innocuous small blister tucked under a toe on his left foot turned out to be melanoma. Medics removed the tumour and Mr Hickie lost two toes as a result of the surgery at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. He continued to get regular checkups . and things were going well as 10 months later he was promoted to service . director for economic and housing growth at Gateshead Council. However, . within the first week of starting his new role he found a lump on his . groin and a subsequent CT scan revealed that the cancer had spread to . his abdomen, right lung and some lymph nodes. Mr . Hickie had an operation to remove his left groin lymph glands and was . recently told that the cancer had spread to his skull and soft tissue . behind his left eye. There is now no cure and he has lost 95 per cent vision in one eye. Mr Hickie was part of a clinical trial . at the Sir Bobby Robson Unit, but was removed from the programme as he . was not responding to treatment. He . is currently undergoing intensive radiotherapy and hopes to receive the . life-extending drug Ipilimubab with the aim of giving him a few . precious extra years with his family. Mr . Hickie said: 'It is the hardest conversation you can ever have telling . your children what's happening. There are two things that upset me the . most. Mr Hickie said telling his children was the hardest conversation and he is devastated that he won't be able to see them grow up past their 10th birthday. He's also been very moved by the kindness towards his family . Look out for new moles, freckles or patches of skin that have suddenly changed colour or size and get them checked by a doctor. In particular pay attention to moles which are asymmetrical – the sides being different. You should also get moles checked out by medics if they are wider than 6mm across, which is a quarter of an inch. Moles which have jagged edges or show uneven colour should also be seen by a doctor, experts say. Other signs include moles or spots which are itchy or bleed and sores that will not heal. 'The first is the children, as I won't be able to see them grow up and probably won't see them past their 10th birthday. The second is the general human kindness that has been shown towards me and my family, as it has been a huge support. 'I'm able to handle my situation because I have a very positive mindset and I am determined to get through this without dwelling on things. I live each day as it comes.' Over the last few weeks, he has been undertaking the heartbreaking tasks of sorting his will, organising his own funeral arrangements and making memory boxes for his children. 'It's going to be very difficult for my wife on her own and I want to put things together to make it as easy for her as possible,' he said. He continues to look to the future and has a number of milestones that he wants to reach, including going to see his favourite football team Arsenal play in the FA Cup final at Wembley next month, celebrate his ninth wedding anniversary on May 28, and see his wife turn 40 on July 5. He added: 'My family, friends, neighbours, work, children's school and medical staff have all been so supportive and have helped me immensely. I am so proud that I have been part of my children's formative years as it is really important to be there when they are a young age. To see how they've developed fills me with joy.'","Andrew Hickie, 42, said the speed of his skin cancer has been devastating .

"David Cameron has agreed to debate with Ukip leader Nigel Farage ahead of the general election. The prime minister has been dogged by criticism for months as he repeatedly ignored calls to go head-to-head with his political rival. Finally, he has conceded to one televised debate featuring Farage, as well as Labour leader Ed Miliband, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, and the Green party leader Natalie Bennett. Conceded: David Cameron has finally accepted a potential debate format featuring Ukip leader Nigel Farage . But voters will have to wait until October, after party conference season, for his aides to decide on a satisfactory format, sources claim. The revelation comes eight months after the Conservative leader told Andrew Marr he did not believe Nigel Farage should be allowed to join the three leaders' in a general election debate. He told the BBC interviewer: 'I think the debates predominantly should be about people who have a prospect of becoming Prime Minister.' Marr replied: 'And you think that Nigel Farage is not going to be our next Prime Minister?' 'I don't think so, no,' laughed Cameron. As the least known leader at the three, Lib Dems' Mr Clegg was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates against Labour PM Gordon Brown and Cameron, with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels . His remarks sparked a wave of criticism, as Ukip gain momentum, swinging Tory voters with their stance on Europe. Today, in a dramatic turnaround, sources close to the prime minister told The Sunday Times he will now 'consider' a format featuring the Ukip leader. 'We are prepared to consider a range of possible line-ups including Nigel Farage,' a source told the paper. 'We're open to debates. We're just not going to start negotiating now.' Addition: Sources close to Cameron claim he will only face up to Nigel Farage in a televised debate if Green Party leader Natalie Bennett is also on the panel . Cameron notoriously lost out to his Coalition partner Nick Clegg in the first TV debates ahead of the 2010 general election. As the least known leader at the three, Lib Dems' Mr Clegg was seen as the big . winner of the first of the three debates against Labour PM Gordon Brown and Cameron, with his poll ratings . rocketing to record levels. Since taking office, the prime minister has made clear he found the debates to be a distraction to the election. But in recent months, Cameron has come under increasing pressure to agree to a debate. In . January, Farage - who is wooing the Tory Right with his strict . anti-immigration campaign - began threatening to broadcast a rival show . to voters if Cameron excludes Ukip from the debates. He . told the BBC’s Daily Politics: ‘Politics has changed a lot since 2010. We’ve seen radical change in Scottish politics in the last decade, in . Northern Irish politics and English politics is going through a big . change. ‘I remember in 2009, when Ukip came second in the euro . elections, being told it can never happen in domestic politics and in . this year’s English county elections, we got nearly a quarter of the . vote. ‘The point is, Ukip is now a significant force in British . politics; we’re polling double what the Lib Dems are and I think . frankly, to exclude Ukip from these debates would probably give us the . benefit of the underdog because it would look like the political class . closing ranks on itself.’","Prime minister made clear he wants Farage to be excluded from debates .

"Tennis was a game made for three, according to the first Victorian rule book. Our ancestors started playing the game outdoors for the first time thanks to a Birmingham lawyer who experimented with the sport. Instead of the Wimbledon as we know it with strict singles and doubles teams - and no mixing of the sexes - the early Victorians were more liberal. First rules: The . 1874 ‘Lawn tennis or Pelota rules of the game’ by Thomas Henry Gem was . the first of its kind . History: Fairlight House in Ampton Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, where the first ever game of lawn tennis was played in 1859. The modern game is now played by millions all over the world . In a version called the Unicorn one player could play against two opponents. And while ladies were discouraged from playing in general, they were permitted to battle against the men. This means if Wimbledon were played the Victorian way we could see a big female name like Serena Williams play the likes of Murray and Djokovic. Tennis experts insist the 1874 Lawn tennis or Pelota rules of the game by Thomas Henry Gem was the first of its kind. How to play: In a version of the game called the Unicorn one . player could play against two opponents. And while ladies were . discouraged from playing - they were permitted to battle against the . men . Former PE teachers Sue Elks, 69, and . Christopher Elks, 68, from Wythall in the West Midlands explained the . difference the modern game has with the tennis of yesteryear. 'The version of tennis where two people against one was called the unicorn match. Classic: Pictured is old-style tennis gear at the grave of Major Thomas Harry Gem, who invented to modern game . 'The game could be played with a racket from the old real version of tennis that was indoors, a wooden bat from the old medieval game five, or simply with the hand. 'The scoring was to 15, where whoever reached this figure first in single points would win the game.' There are several contenders for the title of ‘inventor of tennis’. The game was patented by Major Walter C. Wingfield in London and the game became a global sporting phenomenon shortly after this - with tennis courts popping up from the US to China. By 1877 the All England Club held the first tournament at Wimbledon. However, the game evolved from a combination of real tennis - which was played with a ball and net, but was the exclusive preserve of the aristocracy - and rackets which was popular with the working classes in pubs and prison yards. Ms Elks, Christopher and a host of other tennis-buffs believe the true pioneer of the game was Thomas Henry Gem, who brought the game outside thanks to the new innovations in technology at the time. He is understood to be the inventor of lawn tennis. Thomas Henry Gem created the game of lawn tennis with friend JBA Perera in a back garden in Edgbaston, Birmingham, before forming the first lawn tennis club in Leamington Spa in 1872. 'For the first time the newly developed India rubber allowed balls to bounce on grass,' said Ms Elks. 'Also the invention of the lawn mower meant that grass was now in such well-kept state that play was possible on the lawn. 'It’s only thanks to these new types of technology that the game of tennis as we know it could evolve.' The game we now recognise as tennis was formalised in the 19th cenutry as 'lawn tennis'. Bouncy rubber balls and well-kept lawns were now available across the land to enable what we previously an indoor sport to move outside. But early version of the game have existed since the 12th century, where French monks would play at hitting balls back and forth with their palms. The so-called jeu de paume (game of the palm) took centuries to develop into a game involving nets and rackets. By the 16th century, the game was popular in both England and France, and would be played with solid rackets, much like the offshoot sport known as real tennis today. Modern: Tennis changed significantly in the decades to come - pictured in Andy Murray about to take a shot in the semi-final of last year's Wimbledon tournament . The name tennis comes from the French word tenez - an instruction to 'hold!' or 'receive!' which players would shout to their opponent before serving. It was a favourite of Tudor King Henry VIII, whom some accounts say was playing a match while his second wife Anne Boleyn was executed. It's place in English and French history was confirmed during the reign of Elizabeth I, when Shakespeare's Henry V was first performed. Evolution: Tennis fashion has changed over the years, as the above line-up of ladies dressed in the styles of different periods shows . Towards the start of the play, Henry receives a mocking gift of a treasure chest full of tennis balls from the Dauphin of France. The warlike king then promises to 'march our rackets to these balls' and 'play a set shall strike his father's crown' - fulfilled by their clash at the Battle of Agincourt. Tennis societies and associations proliferated across Britain in the late 19th century, with the first Wimbledon tournament played in 1877. The game's popularity continued to swell in decades to come, and by the 1960s international interest was huge, and the top players were huge stars, earning vast sums of money - a trend which today shows no signs of abating.","The .

"Police have revealed they still have no suspects or leads in the case of a missing pregnant woman who mysteriously disappeared without trace more than a week ago. Hawaiian woman Carly Scott was reported missing on February 10 by her mother and was last seen at her sister's home in Haiku on the island of Maui at 8pm the night before. Family members said Scott, who is five months pregnant, left her sister's house to help her ex-boyfriend Steve Capobianco whose car had broken down on Hana Highway, near the eastern shore of the island. Her abandoned and torched truck was found in a dirt track a few days later, along with some of her belongings, but there's still no trace of her. Scroll down for video . No trace: Charli Scott, who is pregnant, was last seen on Sunday night . Officers have so far interviewed people who last had contact with the 27-year-old including her ex-boyfriend who apparently failed a lie detector test - but so far they have no suspects. Speaking at a press conference, Capt. Jakubczak said the investigation continues to be classified as a missing person's case. He said: 'We . encourage the community, the public, to call with any information they . have no matter how minute or how small they believe it is because we'll . follow up on every lead or tip.' Last . Wednesday, Scott's SUV was found torched and was found abandoned on a dirt track. Jakubczak said a private . search party found clothing and other items the following day that . Scott's family identified as belonging to her. Police have the items and . were processing them, he said. Maui . police were also looking for another missing woman, Moreira Monsalve, . who was last seen in January. Jakubczak said there's no evidence the . cases are connected, though they are similar. Monsalve, 46, was also . last seen by her ex-boyfriend. Abandoned: Miss Scott's car was found burnt out and on its side several days after her disappearance . Mystery: Miss Scott's burned out car was found in a remote area near the home of her ex-boyfriend . A team of 50 to 70 volunteers and family members have been searching for Scott since her mother reported her missing. In an exclusive interview with Hawaii News Now last week Capobianco said: 'She picked me up from my house at 8:30pm, drove out to my truck that I got stuck in Keanae and she dropped me off at my truck -- it took me about 10 minutes to fix my truck, 'cause I had extra light tools with me at that time,' 'And then we came back to Haiku. And I'm pretty sure I saw her lights in my rear-view the entire time.' Capobianco says he went home and went to bed and didn't check to see whether Scott until the following morning. The following day Capobianco says he was awoken about 5:30am. by police knocking on his door. They told him Scott's family had reported her missing and had given them his name. Capobianco admits he didn't have the greatest relationship with the family of his unborn baby's mother. Capobianco says he went to the police station and was interrogated by detectives investigating Scott's disappearance. He also says he was given a lie detector test. 'The police told me I failed,' Capobianco said. 'They didn't make me take it again. I'm honestly not convinced I failed, I think they might have just said that as a tactic, but I really don't know - I'm walking around right now without handcuffs on.' But Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa urged the public to allow investigators to do their job. 'Even . though there's an urgency to try and solve these cases, one has to be . very, very patient, those in our community have to be patient, to allow . that process to evolve,' he said. 'Otherwise, we'll jeopardize the . potential of being able to use whatever evidence is being found.' Scott's . mother, Kimberlyn Scott, told the Maui News that . the family would be 'taking a breather' and wouldn't be actively . searching Tuesday. The team . has been conducting daily searches from Haiku to Hana, by foot, on . motorcycles and on all-terrain vehicles. They are armed with maps of the . island and donated support including search dogs and a drone that took . pictures and video of unreachable cliffs and ravines. Red-head Scott, who goes by the nickname Charli, was born in Woodland, California, . grew up in Sacramento and moved to Maui about 10 years ago. Her father, Robert Scott, flew in from Seattle last week. More than a dozen relatives have flown in from the mainland.

"There's just a few hours to go until Christmas Eve and Santa's reindeer in Lapland are getting ready for their biggest job of the year. But much further south in Scotland, the UK's only free-roaming herd of reindeer don't seem to have a care in the world as they wander across the snow-capped hills of the east Highlands. Rather than calling Lapland their home, the 150-strong Cairngorm Reindeer Herd can be found in two locations north of the border - and are now quite an attraction. Forget Lapland...these reindeer are Scottish: The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd is Britain's only herd of reindeer, found free ranging in the Cairngorm mountains in Scotland . Scottish . home: The herd rages on 2,500 hectares of hill ground between 450 and . 1,309 meters and stay above the tree line all year round regardless of . the weather . Hard-going: Eve Grayson, a Reindeer herder of the Cairgorm Reindeer Herd, feeds the reindeer this morning battling heavy snowfall as she goes . Almost ready for Christmas Eve: Reindeer were introduced to Scotland in 1952 by Swedish Sami reindeer herder, Mikel Utsi which has now grown in number . Around 50 animals can be found ranging . the Cairngorm Mountains while the remainder stay the Glenlivet Estate - . some 30 miles away. This morning, Eve Grayson was pictured battling the elements to herd the beautiful animals as snow swept across the landscape. The reindeer were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by a Swedish reindeer herder, Mikel Utsi. He started with just a few reindeer, but the herd has grown over the years. Hardy: Every reindeer regardless of sex or age grows a new set of antlers every year and they have thick winter coats for arctic life . Weather conditions: They have extra wide, splayed hooves so they can spread weight on soft snow to prevent them sinking . Tasty snacks: Reindeer enjoy nibbling on edible mushrooms, lichens and Arctic vegetation - not just carrots - and their calves are born in the spring . It is currently held at between 130 and 150 by controlled breeding, with most deer being born in the summer months. An account of the introduction written by Mr Utsi is featured on the official website for the animals. In . it, he says: 'Looking across Rothiemurchus Forest to the Cairngorms . from the railway bridge at Aviemore on a cold morning in April 1947, I . was instantly reminded of reindeer pastures in Lapland. Friendly: Reindeer can be very friendly and enjoy following people about, however during the rutting season bulls can be threatening . Herding: In Lapland dogs help with the herding of reindeer but at Glenmore in Scotland they are controlled by voice and titbits . 'In . 1952, I brought some of my Swedish mountain reindeer to Scotland as an . experiment, to show that they could live and breed in these . surroundings. 'Official . difficulties which had caused delay were overcome mainly through the . interest shown by the Press and the influence of the Reindeer Council of . the United Kingdom.' The animals are tame and are often drafted in to pull sleighs during the months of November and December. Uses: Reindeer are bred for meat and clothes can be made from the skin or hide. Reindeer hair is often used for weaving into expensive dress materials . Santa's little helper: The hard-working animals are all tame and regularly appear at festive gatherings throughout the winter months . In . winter, a daily visits to the herd departs from the Reindeer centre in . Glenmore - with guides taking visitors to the animals. Some of the friendlier reindeer have been known to search through rucksacks and follow visitors around on their tour. In . the winter months, teams of reindeer are rounded up to visit Christmas . parades around the country - hopefully getting everyone in the festive . spirit. The hard-working creatures also appear at certain promotional events and even work in film studios. Running free: The herd - which have also featured in numerous films and television shows - is kept at around 150 by controlled breeding .","The 150-strong Cairngorm Reindeer Herd are the UK's only free-roaming herd based in the east Highlands .

"Tea Party favourite 'Joe the Plumber' has taken a union job and four days into the role claims he was bullied by a colleague who called him a 'tea-bagger'. Conservative Joe Wurzelbacher, from Ohio, became famous in 2008 during the U.S. presidential campaign when he questioned then-candidate Barack Obama's tax plan in an encounter which went viral. He was dubbed 'Joe the Plumber' by John McCain's campaign, and Samuel 'Joe' Wurzelbacher was held up as an example of an American worker who would be hurt economically by Obama's election. Scroll down for video . Then-candidate Barack Obama speaks to Joe Wurzelbacher as he canvasses a neighbourhood in Holland, Ohio in 2008. The encounter led to him rising to fame as an 'everyman' and conservative campaigner . After his five-minutes of fame he wrote a book and even made an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. But he's recently raised eyebrows by taking a union job and four days into the role at Chrysler Corporation he claims he was bullied while he was taking a cigarette break by a colleague who used a term meant as an insult to Tea Party members. New job: Joe Wurzelbacher has recently taken a role at Chrysler Corporation and claims he was bullied on day four . At the firm all workers must be United Automobile Workers union members. He wrote in a blog post on JoeforAmerica.com: 'I had three days of orientation, and . now I’m 'on the job' over here at Chrysler and on Day 4, I’m outside on a . break smoking a cigarette and right on cue – some guy calls me a . 'teabagger.' 'Now, I . would be remiss if I didn’t mention that Democrats and liberals, who are . supposed to so tolerant and enlightened regarding homosexuals have for . three or four years now, have been using a gay slur to describe people . who they think are associated with the Tea Party.' 'Tea . Bagger' has traditionally been a derogatory slur used to discriminate . against usually gay men. It is also a word which refers to a sex act. Mr Wurzelbacher added: . 'Decorum prevents me from describing it - they got this thing called . 'Google' now for that - but suffice it to say that the double-standard . for what Democrats can say and what conservatives can say continues . unabated, but still I thought to myself, did this guy think I’m gay, or . was he making a statement of my political affiliation? 'I tried talking to him, but he went off about how he was a 'journeyman' and started walking away.' On the controversial union . issue, he wrote: 'Most union workers have not been mean, and quite a few . asked me questions and talked with me and are cool with me.' He also added that he opposes public unions because 'taxpayers are never properly represented at the bargaining table.' As . for private unions, he wrote that 'it's an American worker's right to . unionize for sure, but that being said, don't expect me not to point out . when or if union leadership takes advantage of union members.' Mr Wurzelbacher's reputation suffered after his five minutes of fame when it was revealed the . tradesman was not, in fact, a licensed plumber. He ran for a U.S. House seat in 2012 but lost in the general election. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain is joined by Mr Wurzelbacher in 2008. The Ohio man even ran for presidency in 2012 . However, he has . spoken at conservative gatherings and has worked with a veterans' organization in Alaska that provides outdoor programmes for wounded . soldiers. He has been . an icon for many anti-establishment conservatives. He drew cheers at a . tea party rally in 2007 in Cincinnati when he told the crowd not to let . 'a bunch of liberal pansies' take away their rights. Last . year he sparked outrage with an online comment piece claiming 'America . needs a white, Republican president' and assured readers that wanting a .

"The tower housing Big Ben will be renamed in honour of the Queen under plans supported by the majority of MPs. David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband are among senior figures from all parties who have backed the proposal to call it the Elizabeth Tower. A total of 331 MPs have now signed up to the campaign. It mirrors a tribute bestowed on Queen Victoria, the only other monarch in British history to have a Diamond Jubilee. Tribute: The tower (left) looms over Westminster opposite the Victoria Tower as soldiers stage a dress rehearsal for the Jubilee celebrations . The tower at the other end of the Palace of Westminster, originally known as the King’s Tower, was renamed the Victoria Tower in her honour. Other MPs backing the idea include Tories William Hague, Theresa May and Iain Duncan Smith; Labour’s David Blunkett, Jack Straw and Ed Balls; and Lib Dems Danny Alexander, David Laws and Chris Huhne. The House of Commons Commission, Parliament’s governing body, will meet by the end of this month and, given the degree of cross-party support, is expected to agree that the 316ft Clock Tower should be renamed. MPs accept it will continue to be known colloquially as Big Ben, the name of the bell it houses, but say the tower itself should carry the present Queen’s name in perpetuity. Both the Cabinet Office and Buckingham Palace are understood to support the proposal. Landmark location: Prince Philip looks on as the Queen delivers a speech in Westminster Hall, next to the tower . Support: Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg are among the politicians to have thrown their weight behind the proposals . Tobias Ellwood, a parliamentary private . secretary at the Foreign Office who proposed the idea, said he was . delighted that it had attracted the support of more than half of all MPs . – a key threshold identified by the authorities. Mr Ellwood said: ‘Commemorating an iconic landmark as famous as Parliament is indeed a truly exceptional tribute and I am grateful that the majority of MPs believe the Queen deserves such an outstanding accolade.’ David Cameron said: ‘It is great news that so many MPs from across the House are backing what would be a fitting tribute to the Queen.’ Subject to commission approval, the proposal will be formally presented to the Palace. A renaming ceremony would then be expected, which the Queen would be invited to attend.","Leaders of the three main parties throw their weight behind proposal .

"This is the extraordinary 911 phone call made by Amanda Berry moments after fleeing the Cleveland dungeon she and two others had been held captive in for a decade. Miss Berry, who disappeared in 2003 aged 14, is heard screaming down the phone to an Ohio police operator: 'I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.' The desperate call for help led to the discovery of Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, who were found alive on Monday inside a house in the west side of the city. Ariel Castro, 52, has been arrested and is in police custody in connection with the kidnapping case along with his two unnamed brothers, who are 50 and 54. SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE 911 CALL . Amanda Berry went missing ten years ago in 2003 just one day before her seventeenth birthday . The Cleveland Police Department has released the recording between Amanda Berry and a 911 operator just minutes after she was able . to escape from the captor that had kept her imprisoned for ten years. Berry sounds breathless but she manages to tell the dispatcher her name and of her decade-long plight, which included giving birth in the house. 'Hello it's me, help me I'm Amanda Berry,' she said. After telling the operator that she's been in the news and missing for ten years she says, 'I'm here, I'm free now.' She gives her address as 2207 Seymour. Other cases: Gina DeJesus (left and right) went missing in 2004 on . her way home from school, while other hostage Michelle Knight disappeared in 2002 . When the dispatcher asks if she's actually at 2210 Seymour Amanda informs her that she is calling from across the street. Berry was kidnapped over ten years ago in 2003 when she was fourteen and kept in a dungeon along with Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. In the 911 call Berry implores the dispatcher that she needs the police immediately. After the dispatcher says that she can talk to the police when they arrive Berry tells her, 'I need them now before he gets back.' Berry gives the name of her captor: Ariel Castro. When the dispatcher asks what he's wearing Berry's voice rises to tell her 'I don't know he's not here now.' In the recording the emotional cries from DeJesus and Knight can be heard.

"Members of a Women’s Institute who knitted a miniature village for sick children were told it could not be given to them because the wool was a health and safety risk. The ladies of Sidford WI in Devon spent a year creating the 6ft by 4ft soft intricate landscape - which boasts miniature people, houses, animals, a farm and a church. It was then offered to children’s hospitals, hospices and nurseries to bring comfort to poorly youngsters, but was rejected over fears the wool could not be sterilised. The ladies were disappointed when several children's hospitals and hospices turned away their miniature village for fears it was a health hazard . Around 30 members of Sidford WI in rural Devon had teamed up to knit the intricate creation and used materials deemed safe for children's toys. The group initially offered the village to Children’s Hospice South West who told them they were unable to accept it because they could not sterilise it. They then approached various nurseries and hospitals in the local area who snubbed their gift because it didn’t come with the correct safety certification. The village took a year to create and measures 6ft by 4ft when laid out properly . Marion Baker, president of the Sidford WI, said: 'It has everything you would expect to see in your typical village.' Attention to detail: The kindhearted ladies even made sure the cows had udders when they were putting together this farm section of their soft village . Jean Bridgeman, a 69-year-old grandmother-of-eight who organised the mammoth project in her weekly craft sessions, says it took a whole year to knit. Ms Bridgeman said: 'We were all a bit fed up with knitting scarves so decided to do something a bit different. 'Everyone got involved in the knitting and we all really enjoyed doing it. We really felt it would bring a smile to some young children’s faces. 'But when we tried several nurseries and organisations we were told that the village couldn’t be used because the wool couldn’t be sterilised. The ladies were sure to stick to materials that were deemed appropriate for children's toys when they were knitting . It hadn't occurred to them that hospitals or hospices may turn them away because the wool hadn't been sterilised . 'Apparently, it didn’t have the correct health and safety certificate. It was such a shame as we had always planned to give it to a local children’s hospice or hospital.' Beryl Kingman, 72, another of the creators, added: 'We didn’t think of this ‘health and safety’ when we started it. 'We started with the intention of giving it away to four or five-year-olds to play with. 'But because of health and safety issues it cannot be sterilised or disinfected, so you would have a problem with a children’s hospice or waiting rooms.' The ladies decided to display the village at a local horticultural show where it caught the eye of a charity volunteer. He told them of a South African orphanage he said would be absolutely delighted to have it for the youngsters. The giant toy has now been boxed up in sections, and is ready to be dispatched in the coming weeks. Marion Baker, president of the Sidford WI, said: 'It has everything you would expect to see in your typical village. 'It’s very intricate - there are roses around the cottages and even the cows have udders. 'It will be lovely if the village can indeed be sent over to the orphanage in South Africa as the children there will get so much enjoyment out of it'.","Thirty WI members worked for a year to create the miniature village for sick children .

"The father of a man suspected in the death of a Florida woman missing since September 2012 may have sealed his son's fate by unintentionally pointing police to her body. The elderly man admitted Monday to police he picked up son Jesus Maqueira from a gas station not far from the elementary school Raquel Calderin, 42, worked at the night she disappeared - shattering the suspected killer's alibi and handing them the evidence they needed to prove his involvement. Searchers then found her blue Ford Expedition submerged in a canal not far away. Maqueira, Calderin's estranged husband, had long-been suspected in her death, but the lack of a body made his trial set to begin next month an uphill climb. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Guilty conscience?: Father Felix Maqueira confessed Monday to picking up son Jesus Maqueira at a gas station not far from where the woman's body was found submerged in a canal later that afternoon - she had been missin since 2012 . Investigators uncovered toll records for Felix Maqueira, 81, that showed his car had been on the Florida Turnpike that night, according to the Miami Herald. The elder Maqueira had previously insisted he never left home that night and that he had no reason to lie. He first tried to cover for his son after the records were shown to him by saying he had been for a ride with his wife, but soon came clean. 'I’m going to tell you something — something you want to know,' the octogenarian told detectives. He admitted to meeting his son after receiving a call from him claiming he 'had run out of gas.' Felix Maqueira then admitted to seeing Calderin's Expedition - the one claimed to have been on empty - drive away from the gas station at which he picked up son Jesus Maqueira - police do not believe he saw the woman alive. The interrogator became visibly upset with the Maquiera family patriarch. Body found: Police found an SUV belonging to Raquel Calderin, 42, who hasn't been seen since September 2012. Human remains were discovered inside the car . 'You lied to me. That hurts me,' said the detective. 'I treated you like my grandfather.' When pressed for a reason he did not question the SUV leaving, the 81-year-old said: 'I didn’t ask.' 'You know why you didn’t ask?' The officer pressed. 'Because in your heart, you know something happened and you didn’t want to know.' The interrogation then ended. Police had no further questions for the father of the suspected killer. Diver soon found the submerged vehicle with Calderin's remains inside. Jesus Maqueira, 56, was originally charged with her murder in February 2013 after reportedly admitting to the murder but taunting police, saying they had no proof without a body. Calderin and Jesus Maqueira had been married for 20 years and had three children when she filed for divorce in September of 2012. She was a school custodian who had left her husband in July 2012 and filed for divorce and a restraining order. According to the Miami Herald, friends of Calderin say Jesus Maqueira was a jealous and domineering husband who frequently physically and emotionally abused his wife. In 1996 and again in 2009 Calderin sought a restraining order against her husband for domestic violence. She repeatedly left the home for days at a time, reportedly staying in women's shelters. She only left her husband for good after meeting another man, Dagoberto Vasquez, in a supermarket, according to reports. Jesus Maqueira then began stalking his wife, bombarding her with phone calls and text messages such as 'die whore,' the Herald reported. He would park his car across the street from Gloria Floyd Elementary where she worked as a custodian and stay for hours, according to criminal complaints. Charged: Jesus Maqueira was arrested in February 2013 for the killing of his wife, with whom he had three children . New development: Krome Avenue north of Tamiami Trail, near where Calderin's SUV was discovered submerged in a canal . On the final day Calderin was seen, Jesus Maqueira confronted her at the school with the couple's 15-year-old daughter in tow and tried to convince her to return home. She refused and after Jesus Maqueira had left, her supervisor allowed the shaken and emotional Calderin to leave early, around 9:30pm. Calderin phoned Vasquez, with whom she was living, as she left the school. But at 9:38pm, the call dropped out. She was never seen again. After months of searching for Calderin, Jesus Maqueira was brought into the Miami-Dade Police Department for questioning. Jesus Maqueira's alibi for the night Calderin disappeared quickly fell apart, and his cell phone records placed him near the elementary school that night - but still police could not pin Calderin's death on him with anything more than circumstantial evidence and his mocking confessions. Denial: Despite allegedly confessing to police, Maqueira has since denied having anything to do with his wife's disappearance . Miami-Dade Detective Juan Segovia told the Miami Herald that Jesus Maqueira at one point told police sarcastically, 'Look, I killed her, take me to jail,' and made light of the fact that there was no physical evidence. 'Mr Maqueira laughed out loud at these investigators and stated that without a body there was very little we could do to him,’ Segovia wrote in a report of the interrogation. According to the Miami Herald, Jesus Maqueira had made cryptic comments to friends and family that whoever had killed Calderin 'would never be found because she was probably dead in a canal.' An inmate who had befriended Jesus Maqueira at the Metro West Detention Center who is now a witness against him told detectives that the suspected killer confessed to the murder, saying he hid in the back of Calderin's SUV and beat her to death before driving the car into the canal, reports the Miami Herald. Jesus Maqueira's murder trial is scheduled to begin next month.","Felix Maqueira, 81, confessed Monday to picking his son up at a gas station in the Everglades the 2012 night Raquel Calderin, 42, went missing .

"From headgear to hemline, a woman’s outfit at Royal Ascot is strictly prescribed. Such is the gentility of the racing festival that dresses must be of ‘modest length’, with straps that are not too narrow. But with no rule banning tattoos, even the event’s stringent fashion police cannot do much about extravagant body art. Denise Sanchez was one of several race-goers showing off their inkings on the first day of the festival yesterday. Stunning: Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins looked wonderful in orange silk and was joined by Bollywood favourite, Aishwarya Rai, on day one of Royal Ascot . Lovely: Gary Lineker's wife Danielle was a picture in pale pink lace, while Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears opted for one of her trademark print dresses . The 41-year-old care practitioner, . from Cornwall, has images stretching all the way down her left leg and . arm, including a bear, a naked woman clutching her knees and a pack of . cards. Miss Sanchez . said: ‘I’m proud of my tattoos. I see it as the colour of my skin, so if . they were banned, it would be like discriminating against a black . person.’ In recent years, . it has become a less-than-stylish affair with fake tan, bizarre hats and . micro minis becoming the norm. But two years after imposing strict . sartorial rules, it seems that Royal Ascot has become a contender in the . style stakes once more. Kim Sears, girlfriend of . multi-millionaire tennis star Andy Murray, made a rather quieter . statement by rejecting a designer outfit in favour of the high street. Indeed, in her £155 Whistles dress, . LK Bennett shoes and simple hat, the  25-year-old seemed to have taken . some style tips from the Duchess of Cambridge. Danielle Lineker and Katherine Jenkins both . seemed to be celebrating big wins from the balcony on the first day of . the famous race meet . Famous friends: Princess Eugenie excitably greets Katherine Jenkins  at the opening day of Royal Ascot . Another racegoer leading the charge . was Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins who looked stunning in a sunny . bright orange dress and matching orange and hot pink fascinator by . milliner, Phillip Treacy. Her . daring choice was echoed by many of her fellow race goers, most of whom . plumped for bright hues - perhaps to make up for the miserable squalls . of rain that sent many scurrying for shelter. Jenkins . was joined by Earl Spencer and his Canadian wife, Karen, who looked . beautiful in a low key cream dress and Girls Aloud singer, Sarah . Harding, who picked a slick black dress teamed with a showstopping gold . necklace. Also on hand to get Royal Ascot off to a . flying start was Bollywood megastar, Aishwarya Rai, who chose a subtle . monochrome ensemble, topped with a pretty black and white floral hat. Gary . Lineker's wife, Danielle, looked particularly beautiful in a stunning . pale pink 1930s style frock teamed with a white picture hat, while Andy . Murray's other half, Kim Sears, plumped for trademark prints teamed with . a pair of delicate lemon shoes. In the paddock, a flock of beautifully dressed women in a array of stunning rainbow . hues were drawing admiring glances from male race goers, although the . odd shivering girl in a too-short skirt could also be seen. Hats were big and bold, with floral . motifs spotted . adorning headwear up and down the course. Racegoer . Florence Claridge wore an . artificial pink fuchsia plant on her head complete with dozens of blooms . and a matching shocking pink dress. She said: 'You have to be a trooper . to wear this, it's quite heavy - but I've been coming here for 25 . years.' Fellow guest, . Jackie St Clair chose an enormous pink rose made by milliner Bundle . MacLaren. She said: 'It's made from layers of silk and is fabulous. I've . been . coming to Ascot for 31 years. I like the fashion, the Pimm's and the . quintessential Englishness of it.' Mono mania: Along with Bollywood star Aishwarya . Rai, both Countess Spencer and Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding plumped . for low key black and white combos . Colourful: . Guests arriving at day one of this year's Royal Ascot appeared to have . taken organisers' stern sartorial advice firmly to heart . Striking: Londoner Carrie Colbert and pretty Jackie St Clair (right) wowed fellow racegoers with their stunning floral head wear . No . blooms for the boys!

Crimson classic: The Tootsie Rollers perform on day one of Royal Ascot, dressed in vintage style red dresses teamed with matching fascinators . Hats you win... Blooms have proved to be Ascot's hottest hat trend so far, although for some stylish guests, less was clearly more . Cool couples: The wife of Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford looked fresh and pretty in pale blue while Ruth Langsford (right), wife of Eamonn Holmes, was lovely in lilac . Former Channel 4 racing pundit, John McCririck, was . on typically bombastic form as he wandered in, trademark bowler hat . and cigar firmly in place. Like fellow female guests, McCririck . embraced the floral theme, courtesy of a huge cabbage rose in his . buttonhole, although his wife, in a pretty pansy print dress, had the . edge in the style stakes. Also looking good was Ruth Langsford, wife of veteran Sky News presenter, Eamonn Holmes, who looked radiant in a pretty lilac dress and cream picture hat. Nearby, Ascot's phalanx of dress code . enforcers - tasked with ensuring straps are at least 2.5 inches wide . and skirts are modest - watched beadily, while surveying passing guests. And not everyone made the cut. One unfortunate racegoer - a gentleman sporting a large floral headpiece - fell foul of the Royal Ascot fashion police and was sent home to change. The Queen, joined by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, made a grand entrance processing along the course in a carriage. Although today's races didn't feature a thoroughbred from the Queen's own stables, her filly, Estimate, is one of the favourites for Thursday's Gold Cup -  a race the Queen would dearly love to win. In the foreword to the official programme, the Queen wrote: 'I was fortunate enough too own a winner at last year's royal meeting, so I know what a thrill it is to have success at this wonderful racecourse whether you are a trainer, jockey, or one of the many hard-working stable staff associated with every runner.' Also in the running for the Gold Cup is last year's winner, Colour Vision, and 2010 champion, Rites of Passage. Today's races include the Queen Anne Stakes, expected to be carried off by American horse, Animal Kingdom, followed by the King's Stand Stakes, which will see South African colt, Shea Shea, start the race in pole position with bookmakers. Body art: Claire Brockett sported a glittery dress while her friend Denise Sanchez showed off her tattoos outside the Royal Enclosure . Cheerful: . It takes more than a drop of rain to make veteran racing pundit, John . McCririck, lose his good humour - just ask former employer Channel 4 . Opulent: Racegoer, Anneka Tanaka-Svenska, sports big pink blooms combined with ropes of pearls on her  utterly spectacular hat . Day out: A trio of neatly dressed racegoers make their way towards the entrance carrying a pair of traditional wicker picnic baskets . There's always one! This lady's yellow dress is breaking more than one style rule (left), while Londoner Elisabeth Dana shows how it's done with a chinoiserie cloche hat . Rainbow friends: Colour-matching racegoers arrive in the morning of the first day of the meet . Traditionally dressed greencoats were on hand to assist guests throughout the course (left) and liquid lunches were the order of the day . Dapper: Top hatted, dark suited gentlemen check out the form guide ahead of the Queen Anne Stakes - the first race of the Royal Ascot meet . Last minute tweaks: A trio of unlucky groundsmen are tasked with making sure that no trace of manure remains on the pristine grass of the  racecourse .

"Trayvon Martin's mom has written a letter to the parents of Michael Brown, following the Ferguson, Missouri teen's shooting death by a police officer earlier this month. In the letter to parents Michael Brown Sr and Lesley McSpadden, Sybrina Fulton speaks about losing her 17-year-old son in another senseless act of gun violence and gives advice on how best to cope with the tragic situation they've been thrust into. Fulton lost her son Trayvon in 2012 when he was shot dead in the apartment complex where he was living by resident George Zimmerman, who thought the black teen was a burglar. Scroll down for video . I understand: Sybrina Fulton, the mother of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin, has written a letter to the parents of Michael Brown, who died in a similar case of gun violence . Slain: Trayvon Martin (left) was shot dead in his own apartment complex by resident George Zimmerman, who thought the teen was breaking into a home. Michael Brown (right) was gunned down by a police officer earlier this month in Ferguson, MIssouri . Two years . later, Fulton says she still hasn't come to terms with the loss of her . son, but says she's comforted by the overwhelming support she continues . to receive. She . adds that there is meaningful work in helping other families who have . dealt with a similar loss and in raising awareness of the growing issue . of gun violence. 'Neither . of their lives shall be in vain,' Fulton writes in the letter published . by TIME. 'The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond . the tragedies. While we fight injustice we will also hold ourselves to . an appropriate level of intelligent advocacy. If they refuse to hear . us, we will make them feel us' In mourning: Brown's parents Michael Brown Sr (left) and Lesley McSpadden (right) attend a rally at Greater Grace Church on August 17 . Michael Brown was shot dead earlier this month after a confrontation with St Louis police officer Darren Wilson. An autopsy report released Sunday revealed he was shot six times, including twice in the head. His death has sparked violent protests in Ferguson, where police and protesters have been clashing nearly every night. While Brown's death has become a national issue, Fulton says this is also a deeply personal issue for the teen's parents. 'Michael . is your son. A son that barely had a chance to live,' she writes, . adding that the tragedy is further complicated by the 'fact that the . killer of your son is alive, known and currently free'. However, Fulton says the Browns should expect to receive a 'well of support from all corners of the world'. Tension: Brown's death has sparked violence in Ferguson, where local police have been clashing with protesters nearly every night. Above, a man is arrested during a protest Monday night . She advises them to surround themselves with 'proven and trusted support' and to honor their son and his life - 'not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions'. 'I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed,' Fulton writes. Fulton has devoted herself to supporting the families of gun violence victims through the Trayvon Martin Foundation.","Sybrina Fulton lost her son Trayvon Martin in February 2012, when he was shot dead by George Zimmerman while walking in his apartment complex .

"The Duchess of Cambridge is arguably the most famous woman in the world and has fans and photographers following her every move. But one young woman says she experiences exactly the same as Kate and can't walk around her home town of . Windsor without being mobbed by tourists - because she looks just like . the Duchess. Gabriella Munro-Douglas claims that coach loads of visitors surround the her in the hope of getting a photograph every time she goes out in the royal Berkshire town mistaking her for the famous Royal. Scroll down for video . Kate-a-like: Gabriella Munro-Douglas cannot walk around her home town of Windsor without being mobbed by tourists - because she looks just like the Duchess of Cambridge . The 26-year-old brunette has now decided to cash in on the striking resemblance and secured a job as a Kate-alike. Dressed in a black and white polka-dot dress from Topshop - which the former Kate Middleton was previously pictured wearing and subsequently caused to sell out- it is clear that the resemblance is quite striking. Police outside Windsor Castle regularly ask Gabriella to move on because the crowds block the road when they stop and stare and officers have even asked her for . ID when they feared she could try to sneak past security guards, posing . as the 31-year-old princess. Gabriella, a former public schoolgirl, takes the whole experience in her stride, politely posing, smiling and chatting to admirers. Mobbed: The 26-year-old brunette gets papped by tourists every time she goes out in the royal Berkshire town and even gets id'd outside Windsor Castle in case she breaks in under the guise of Kate . She said: 'It is so much fun being Kate's look-a-like and people are so nice and friendly to me all the time. 'But getting mobbed is quite bizarre and is like a snapshot of being a celebrity. 'In a few minutes I go from being my normal self to putting my dress on and people following me around. 'When they start to crowd around it can be intimidating.' The Kingston University graduate was born and bred in Windsor, where her builder father lives. She says she has always loved the royal family and went to garter ceremonies when she was at Windsor Girls' School. She cherishes the day as a 14-year-old when Prince William held a door open for her at Eton College, where he studied. Double take: Dressed in a black and white polka-dot dress from Topshop - which the former Kate Middleton was previously pictured wearing and subsequently caused to sell out- the resemblance is quite striking . And she said it is now 'weird' thinking about how she looks so much like his wife. However, it does have its downside - especially when she wants to visit Windsor Castle with friends. Wearing a foam bump - to look more like the pregnant duchess - she said: 'Police officers have stopped me when I was with friends and checked my details as thought I was trying to sneak into one of the rooms as Kate.' Speaking about her job as a Duchess of Cambridge look-a-like she said: 'People were saying to me I looked like her and I thought it would be an interesting opportunity and fun.' It is a far cry from her 9 to 5 job as a furniture designer and buyer. Her agency has 120 Duchesses on the books, but Gabriella is in demand and was used by photographer Alison Jackson in recent tongue-in-cheek royal portraits. Almost famous: Speaking about her job as a Duchess of Cambridge look-a-like she said: 'People were saying to me I looked like her and I thought it would be an interesting opportunity and fun' Gabriella can earn up to £1,000 per appearance, but has had to turn down some requests. She said: 'I had people asking if I would pose topless after the Duchess was snapped on holiday in France. 'I don't want to tarnish Kate's image and do not want to do anything to damage mine or her reputation.' Much of her spare time is spent looking at articles on Kate, to see if her appearance has changed and at what clothes she has been wearing. And she takes criticism of the Duchess by friends or in newspaper articles 'personally' as she feels close to her. Big change: The 9-5 furniture designer can earn up to £1,000 per appearance, but has had to turn down some requests . Gabriella says she will 'make hay while the sun shines', and has no idea how long she will carry on as a Duchess look-a-like. She said: 'I thought it would last a year after the wedding, but she is becoming more popular which will continue with the royal baby too. 'Maybe in 20 years I will still be doing it.

'I supported him in 1998 because I think he was the right person at the time but after five (sic) terms it is time to let some fresh air in and leave the place to someone else,' the Frenchman said.

"A pregnant Texas woman has been stabbed multiple times by an intruder as her horrified soldier husband serving overseas helplessly watched the attack play out in real time on video chat. Rachel Poole, 31, was talking to her husband, Justin Pele Poole, on FaceTime Wednesday night when a man identified as 19-year-old Corey Moss broke into their El Paso home and lunged at her with a knife. According to an arrest affidavit obtained by KFOX14, Mrs Poole recognized her assailant as a man who owed her husband money and screamed out his name. Horror show: Rachel Poole (left), who is nine months pregnant, was stabbed multiple times by an intruder in her home as her husband Justin (right), who is deployed overseas, watched in horror on video chat . Ambush: El Paso police say Moss went to the Pooles' home in the 9400 block of Wichita Circle, broken in and waited for Rachel to come home . The 31-year-old mother-to-be, who is nine months pregnant, was rushed to University Medical Center in critical condition suffering from multiple stab wounds and fractures to her body and face. Doctors said her unborn baby girl, who is due in a week, was in good condition. The couple plan to name her Isabella. According to police, the wounded victim was able to call 911 and give the name of the suspect to police. Meanwhile, Justin Poole called the 19-year-old's co-workers, who helped apprehend Moss and seized the knife allegedly used in the attack. Suspect: Cory Bernard Moss, 19, allegedly admitted to the knife attack, which was reportedly sparked by a money dispute . Following his arrest, police said Moss admitted to stabbing Rachel Poole . The teenager has been charged with criminal attempted capital murder and was ordered held on $60,000 bond. Neighbors told KFOX14 they that Moss owed the Pooles money for car repairs because he had borrowed a vehicle from them and wrecked it. According to El Paso police, Moss, a soldier attached to Fort Bliss, went to the Pooles' home in the 9400 block of Wichita Circle to talk to Rachel about the money he owed her husband. The woman wasn't home, so the 19-year-old allegedly forced his way into the house and lay in ambush, waiting for Mrs Poole to return. When Poole came home, she opened the Apple video chat program FaceTime on her phone and began talking to her husband, who is stationed in southwest Asia. Joy and sorrow: Mr Poole (top right) wrote that their unborn baby girl (bottom right) is doing fine, but his wife (left) had lost an eye . A short time later, police say Moss came out of hiding and surprised Rachel Poole from behind, repeatedly stabbing her with a foldout stainless steel knife and beating her. According to the affidavit, the victim instantly recognized Moss as her husband's debtor and yelled out his name several times so Justin could hear it over the phone. Following the attack, police say Moss fled and called a co-worker to pick him up and drive him to Fort Bliss. Meanwhile, Justin Pele Poole called Moss' colleagues to alert them of the suspect’s imminent return to the military base. The 19-year-old's co-workers intercepted him and found the knife in the car where he was riding. Fort Bliss spokesman Joe Buccino said that Army Pvt Poole has been deployed in southwest Asia for the past nine months, HLN-TV reported. Long distance: Army Pvt Pele Poole, pictured left and right with his wife, has spent the past nine months serving in southwest Asia . He is scheduled to arrive home in El Paso sometime today, and is not likely to be sent back to his overseas posting in the wake of the attack on his wife. On Wednesday, a furious Justin Pele Poole took to his Facebook page to express his anger with the situation, writing in part: 'I promised to give my life for this freedom not the other way around. I failed her but never again.’ This afternoon, the soldier wrote on his page that he had the 'hardest conversation' of his life with his wounded wife over the phone. According to Poole, Rachel told him that she had lost an eye in the attack and asked him if it was a 'deal breaker' for him. ‘My wife is my wife til I'm no longer breathing,’ the serviceman wrote. ‘No man can change that and though I was not here to protect her this time it will never happen again that's my word.’","Soldier Corey Moss, 19, was arrested in Fort Bliss, Texas, in the knife attack on 31-year-old Rachel Poole .

Gary Bromige, aged 25, from South Norwood in South London, will appear at South Western Magistrates' Court, Battersea, south London, today charged with causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. PC Andrew Duncan, 47, was pronounced dead in hospital yesterday, less than 36 hours after the hit-and-run crash. Location: A general view of a section of the A217 Reigate Avenue, Sutton, south London, where PC Andrew Duncan was knocked down in a hit-and-run crash in the early hours of Friday morning . The long-serving Met officer and . married father-of-two was injured as he operated a speed trap with a . colleague in a residential area of Sutton, South London, in the early . hours of Friday. He was critically injured as he attempted to stop a fast-moving VW Golf by signalling for the driver to pull over. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe led the tributes: 'Andy was a hard working and courageous policeman. He served the community as both a police officer and as a Scouting volunteer. 'The night he was injured, he was doing a job that he loved and we all had every right to expect he would return safely to his home and family - tragically that was not the case.' Mayor of London Boris Johnson added to tributes to the officer, who served as a beat officer and with riot squads before joining the traffic unit ten years ago. ‘His death is a tragedy and a reminder of the courage and sacrifice shown daily by the men and women who keep London safe,’ he said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said she sent her ‘deepest condolences’. PC Duncan joined the Metropolitan Police in 1990 and was originally posted to Battersea.

"Oxford University psychologists found husbands and wives who kept in touch using social media had less satisfying marriages . Couples who communicate using Facebook could be putting a strain on their relationship, researchers have warned. Oxford University psychologists found husbands and wives who kept in touch using social media had less satisfying marriages. They surveyed the types of social media used by 3,500 couples. These included Facebook, emails, texts, tweets and instant messages. Those using more than five different channels to communicate with their loved one had a 14 per cent drop in average relationship satisfaction. Dr Bernie Hogan, from Oxford Internet Institute, suggested marital disharmony could be triggered by the stress and time pressure of constantly maintaining so many different threads of communication. He said: ‘Using these media is great in moderation. But more is not necessarily better. ‘We need to walk back from the idea that more communication by more media is a good thing. ‘We have been drunk on new media over the past ten years. Now we realise that its absence is bad, but overuse is also bad. ‘It’s important to be accessible without being overbearing’ Britons spend an estimated 62 million hours each day on Facebook and Twitter, according to a new survey on social media habits. The poll, for the bank firstdirect suggests that around 34 million hours are spent on Facebook each day, with a further 28 million hours on Twitter. And almost a third (30%) of the UK’s 33 million Facebook users are on the network for at least an hour a day, with 13% spending at least two hours on Facebook each day.

"Former WAG Lizzie Cundy has gone head-to-head with author Kathy Lette after the writer called footballer wives and girlfriends 'bad role models' who are nothing more than 'life support systems to a pair of breasts'. Lette said such women 'live vicariously' through their partners, while Cundy - who used to be married to footballer Jason Cundy - maintained that supporting one's footballing husband or boyfriend is an arduous and admirable way to live, and should be applauded accordingly. The two appeared today on ITV's This . Morning to debate the question of whether or not young girls should . aspire to be WAGS, and the audience voted overwhelmingly with Lette, who called such women 'sabre-toothed husband hunters whose only skills are sports car alighting with minimum knicker flashing'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kathy Lette, left, and Lizzie Cundy, right, engaging in an animated debate this morning on ITV's This Morning over whether or not WAGS are good role models for young girls . The two women were at loggerheads during the ITV debate about WAGs as role models . The author said: What upsets me is that when they do research into schools, what young girls want to be is famous. Not doctors or lawyers, just famous. WAGS are just life support systems to a pair of breasts. 'Why do people aspire to be with footballers? They all treat women like footballs. They drop them as soon as they've scored.' Cundy admonished Lette for her cliched, stereotypical view of footballer partners, saying: 'Who do you know in the footballing world, Kathy? The majority of the girls I know all have jobs, all work, do so much for charity and do great . things, and what you are saying is absolutely appalling.' 'I write. I have a column in Closer and the Express and I do red carpet work. And I'm in a musical about WAGs. You should come and see it, Kathy.' Kathy Lette and Lizzie Cundy agreed to disagree on This Morning . Kathy said: 'I think WAGs the acronym stands for Worst Acronym for Girls, ever. 100 years since Emmeline Pankhurst tied herself to the railings, at the 2006 Fifa cup we had women aspiring to little more than being a human handbag, draped decoratively over the arm of some knight in shining Armani football player.' Cundy fought back, saying: 'I was at both world cups when . the media yourselves put them up there as WAGs, they named us WAGs they . put them on the front of the papers because they were selling the . papers. People were interested in them, the girls were there to support . their husband and I think that is admirable.' Lette added that her father was a famous footballer so her mother was a WAG: 'But she always had a career and independent identity. What I disagree with is women living vicariously through men and being seen as subservient and decorative.' In the This Morning worm poll, 76 per cent of viewers agreed with Lette that WAGs are not good role models.","Kathy Lette said WAGs are bad role models for young girls .

"When it comes to physical attributes, the women of Britain are happiest with their legs. Those in Birmingham and Sheffield are particularly proud of their slender pins, with 61 per cent saying it was the body part they were most likely to flaunt. Meanwhile, women in Edinburgh are most likely to be getting their stomachs out beneath skimpy crop tops, and those in Woking wearing clothes that show off their bottoms, according to a survey. Women all over the UK say their legs are their best asset, with those in Birmingham and Sheffield most likely to of all to favour theirs . On average, 47 per cent of British women said their legs were their best feature, compared to seven per cent who scored their stomach's highest, according to the survey of 5,000 women by fashion site Dressipi. But while British women were proudest of their legs at a national level, they were also unexpectedly pleased with their behinds. Some 18 per cent of women polled said they dress to show off their bottoms: 42 per cent of women and 31 per cent in Leeds named their bottoms their favourite feature. Manchester is the UK's bustiest city, with 39 per cent of the city's women saying they had an 'ample' bust, a whole 10 per cent above the national average of 29 per cent. Of the 5,000 women surveyed by Dressipi, most were likely to dress to flaunt their legs . The Welsh capital of Cardiff boasted the nation's flattest chests, with only 23 per cent of the city's women putting themselves in the 'ample' category. Tummies were one area which most British women agreed it was best to put away. Nationally, only seven per cent of women considered them a favoured feature, dipping to three per cent in Liverpool. Edinburgh, however, bucked this trend, where a startling 15 per cent of women admitted a penchant for midriff-baring. Nationally, love handles were the feature most feared by British women, with 29 per cent of those questioned saying they dressed to conceal them. Both Manchester and Glasgow suffered from an above average (38 per cent) fear of love handles, but Liverpool was the city where women most dreaded the muffin top at 44 per cent. Preston was the UK's hottest spot for cankles, but even then only five per cent of women said they dressed to conceal them, compared to a tiny national average of two per cent. Preston is also officially Britain's capital of the backless dress: 29 per cent of Preston women declared their backs their best feature, almost double the national average of 14 per cent - and way ahead of Leeds which languished at the bottom of the 'backs are beautiful' league table at 8 per cent. Second only to love handles in the 'put it away' stakes, thighs were rated the least favourite feature of 28 per cent of women at a national level. Problematic thighs were also something which preoccupied more women than usual in London (31 per cent) and Leeds (34 per cent). The UK city most likely to cover up its thighs was Cardiff, where 37 per cent of women said they dressed to conceal their upper legs - even if a greater proportion of local women were happy to show off their lower legs. Dressipi stylist Natalie Theo said: 'Risqué plunging necklines and racy backless dresses are quite high maintenance and best reserved for special occasions whereas dressing those pins to maximum effect can easily be achieved by day or night. For our ""legs eleven"" nation,stylishly flaunting their best leggy assets is not just about rising hemlines. Skinny jeans will do the trick and opaque or statement tights are a perfect alternative for those who would prefer not to adopt the New York front-row fashion week trend of daring-to-go-bare.' 'Whether you're big-busted or more the bootylicious type, there's always a way to make this season's looks work for you' Dressipi co-founder Sarah McVittie concluded: 'The Body Map of Great Britain shows that when it comes to fashion, women have never been savvier. 'Whereas in decades gone by getting a few wise words on how to suit your wardrobe to your own body shape was an informal, hit-and-miss affair, award-winning style advice is never more than a few mouse clicks away. 'It's great to see women around the country putting style advice into practice in different ways. Whether you're big-busted or more the bootylicious type, there's always a way to make this season's looks work for you, and I'm delighted to see fashion recommendation services like ours beginning to help women do just this.'","Those in Sheffield and Birmingham particularly enamoured with their legs .

"It was a scene of horror that has scarred their minds for decades. But now, in their nineties, seven US prisoners of war have returned to Omori, where they were starved and forced into manual labor for four grueling years. The Japanese camp, which was built on a superficial island between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1941, is now a boat racing venue surrounded by office buildings. Today, however, it played host to a small group of men who know the true horrors that took place in that spot. Remembering: US veterans (left to right) Oral C Nichols, 93, William Sanchez, 96, and Jack Schwartz, 99, stand together in front of the Goddess of Mercy statue built over the Omori camp where they were held prisoners . Bill Sanchez, 96, was one of thousands of men put to work unloading cargo for hours. They would work through the night with just a small bowl of rice for food. But in those hungry times, they also were among the luckiest, he claims. '[It] was great work because we had a lot of opportunities to pinch food. We learned real quick,' said Sanchez, of Monterey Park, California, who watched as American fire bombs incinerated nearby neighborhoods. Sanchez joined six of his comrades invited to visit the camp - now known as Peace Island - by the Japanese government. Amazed, he told Tokyo's Temple University how much the country has changed: 'All this land you see was reclaimed by us, the American prisoners of the war and the British prisoners of the war,' Sanchez said. 'And I am amazed at how well they have used the land.' Changed: Sanchez can still remember feeling so hungry he would steal food while unloading cargo . Every single one of the prisoners could still vividly remember their hunger almost 70 years ago. 'In four years, I never had a good meal', said Jack Schwartz, 99, of Hanford, California. Schwartz was a civil engineering graduate of the California Institute of Technology when he enlisted in the Navy Civil Engineer Corps in 1940. Taken prisoner in Guam, he spent much of his imprisonment at the Zentsuji Camp, a 'showcase' camp on western Japan's Shikoku island. 'I arrived two days ago and had my first good meal ever in Japan.' Like the other former POWs, Schwartz marveled at Tokyo's progress since Japan's surrender in August 1945, especially high-tech toilets equipped to warm, wash and dry. 'I sat down on a toilet seat and it was warm!' Oral C. Nichols, 93, of Carlsbad, New Mexico, was working in construction on Wake Island in the Pacific when the Japanese took the island in 1941, capturing 5,000 prisoners. By the time the war ended, he had been moved to Shanghai and then to an open pit iron mine in northern Japan. Peace-making: The seven veterans were invited to the built-over site by the Japanese government . 'But also I was young and had set myself a goal to live, that I was going to live regardless,' Nichols said. During the war, the Japanese held over 30,000 allied force members as prisoners in dozens of camps in Japan, China and elsewhere in Asia, according to the POW Research Network Japan. The former POWs said they understood that the cruelty and brutality they experienced during the war had much to do with the times. One of 91-year-old Darrel Stark's most vivid memories is of a supervisor in the prison camp at Yokkaichi, a copper smelting center in western Japan, who did not retaliate when Stark and another prisoner stole his lunch. 'He came the next day with two lunches, 'One for you, and one for me,'' said Stark, of Stafford Springs, Connecticut. 'If he had reported me, I wouldn't have been speaking to you tonight.'","Seven former POWs invited to Omori Prison Camp by Japan's government .

"Charges have been filed against two law school students accused of decapitating an exotic bird at a Las Vegas casino before playfully throwing around its severed body to the horror witnesses. Justin Teixeira, 24, has been charged with felony killing and felony torturing of an animal while Eric Cuellar, 24, faces a misdemeanour charge of instigating, engaging in or furthering an act of animal cruelty. Police say the students at the University of California, Berkley, were witnessed laughing and throwing around the body of the dead, 14-year-old guineafowl at the Flamingo resort-casino last October. Charged: From left Eric Cuellar, and Justin Teixeira, both 24, are charged with killing an exotic bird at the Flamingo resort-casino last October before playfully tossing around its severed head . 'I (expletive) killed wildlife,' Teixeira said, according to a report by witnesses obtained by LVRG.com. The large bird named Turk was part of . the Flamingo's Wildlife Habitat, a garden area with ponds and streams . that houses many types of birds. 'This was a cruel and malicious act,' Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said in a statement, adding that an investigation is ongoing and could result in criminal charges against others. 'It is important to hold people accountable for their actions.' Surveillance video captured the men chasing the bird into some trees, authorities said, and witnesses told police the two emerged carrying the bird's body and severed head. Richard Schonfeld, an attorney representing Cuellar, said he was pleased prosecutors opted for a lesser charge for his client with the student on track academically to become an attorney himself. 'Eric has an exemplary background and I'm pleased the DA chose to proceed with a misdemeanour,' said Schonfeld, whose client faces up to six months in jail if convicted. 'It's an acknowledgement that he did not physically harm the bird.' Decapitated: The large African bird was a 14-year-old helmeted guinea fowl named Turk seen on video surveillance being chased by the men into trees before emerging severed . If convicted on all charges, Teixeira could be sentenced to prison time. His attorney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Thursday afternoon. Criminal charges - especially felonies - can affect a person's future in the legal field. The State Bar of California, for example, requires applicants to demonstrate good moral character. A statement on the bar's website notes that people convicted of violent felonies or felonies involving moral turpitude 'are presumed not to be of good moral character in the absence of a pardon or a showing of overwhelming reform and rehabilitation.' Gina Greisen, the president of Nevada Voters for Animals and an advocate for the state's newly passed, tougher law against animal cruelty, said those potential consequences are appropriate. Police scene: Police were called to the Flamingo Hotel around 9.30am on October 12 arresting the two men whom police said didn't appear to be on any drugs . 'I don't think you should get to be a lawyer if you do something like that,' Greisen said. 'If you are lucky enough to be a Berkeley law student, you know you have to be above reproach in a lot of ways.' 'According to the security people, the men were laughing and joking about the fact of what they had done,' Sgt. John Sheahan of Metro Police told KLAS immediately after the incident on October 12. Police said they didn't believe drugs were involved. 'Security had allegedly seen these . men chasing the bird into a brushy treed area of that habitat and then . coming out of that area with the bird in two pieces,' said Sgt Sheahan. Witnesses also supported security's claim.","Justin Teixeira, 24, has been charged with felony killing and felony torturing of an animal .

"Oil prices opened Friday morning down more than $4, signaling fallout from OPEC's decision not to cut production levels. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided not to lower production on Thursday in spite of dropping oil prices and pleas from poorer member nations. Around 9 a.m. Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was trading at $69.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a $4.40 per barrel drop from Wednesday. Crude: Oil prices opened Friday morning down more than $4, signaling fallout from OPEC's decision not to cut production levels . Prices had slumped even lower in electronic trading during the Thanksgiving holiday, where oil dropped down to $67.75. The Friday low was a four-year record for US crude prices as uncertainties remain over consumer demand and global economic growth. As consumer gas prices drop, so too does hesitation among Americans to spend more during holiday shopping. 'Tis the season: energy down, consumer up,' said Strategas Research Partners, reports the USA Today. 'The continued decline in the price of crude oil and the resulting savings at the gas pump will likely continue to bolster consumer shares as the market anticipates the positive implications on consumer spending,' said Strategas partner Nicholas Bohnsack. At OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, there was some belief among analysts that the organization would push for compliance with current production levels, held at 30 million a day. Trading: Prices had slumped even lower in electronic trading during the Thanksgiving holiday, where oil dropped down to $67.75 . In October, members had produced an average of 30.6 million barrels daily, according to the International Energy Agency. While there was talk about 'the rapid decline in oil prices in recent months,' an official statement called for 'stable oil prices at a level which did not affect global economic growth but which, at the same time, allowed producers to receive a decent income and to invest to meet future demand.' Thus no action was taken, with OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah El-Badri saying the group would wait until its next meeting in June.","US benchmark West Texas Intermediate traded at $69.29 at the opening of the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday .

'For all the nonsense talked by opponents of hunting, real people are . showing real support for this hunt and the 300 others meeting all over . the country. 'When the hounds rode off down the High Street the cheers from the crowd brought a tear to quite a few eyes.' Chairman of the hunt, Mikey Elliot, . praised the 'sense of community' around the Heythrop and branded the . RSPCA prosecution – which led to a £4,000 fine – 'corrupt bullying'. At the annual North Cornwall Foxhounds in Camelford a mother was injured when a horse slipped and fell on her. Onlookers say the woman's daughter was on the horse, called Honeybell, when it suddenly spun round, fell, and landed on top of her. Witness Peter Glaser said: 'The horse slipped and fell on top of her. Paramedics arrived to treat her and she was wrapped in a blanket to keep warm. It must have been a nasty shock.' Elsewhere, a spectator was taken to . hospital with a head injury after she was kicked by a horse at a hunt in . Rivington, near Bolton.

Mr Paterson, a keen supporter of country sports including hunting, told the Daily Telegraph: 'There's only a point having a vote if you're going to win. 'At the moment, it would not be my proposal to bring forward a vote we were going to lose. There needs to be more work done on Members of Parliament.' He went on: 'It is our clear intention to have a free vote but we need to choose an appropriate moment.' Campaigners say enforcing the restriction wastes police time, and suggest some officers turn a blind eye to breaches of the law.

"American drugs company Pfizer walked away from tabling a new £70billion deal for British rival AstraZeneca yesterday, just two hours before the takeover deadline.

Pfizer is now blocked from making a renewed assault on Astra for six months, but City experts believe Pfizer is likely to return as soon as this cooling off period expires. Withdrawn: US drugs giant Pfizer today officially . withdrew from its attempt to take over AstraZeneca (Macclesfield office pictured) after the UK-based . group repeatedly spurned its advances . The proposed £55-a-share takeover would have been the largest ever of a UK firm by a foreign company. Driving . Pfizer’s ambition was a complex ‘tax inversion’ plan that would have . seen the American company switch its domicile to Britain, slashing the . firm’s tax bill. The deal . was  criticised by scientists, investors and MPs amid fears it could . lead to job losses in the crucial life sciences industry. AstraZeneca . is now under pressure from shareholders - several of which wanted Astra . to talk to Pfizer about a deal – to show it can prosper as an . independent business. Pfizer said in a statement: 'On 18 . May 2014, Pfizer announced that it had made a final proposal to . AstraZeneca to make an offer to combine the two companies. Following the . AstraZeneca board's rejection of the proposal, Pfizer announces that it . does not intend to make an offer for AstraZeneca.' Ian . Read, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, said: 'We continue to . believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full . value for AstraZeneca based on the information that was available to us. 'As we said from the start, the pursuit of this transaction was a potential enhancement to our existing strategy. We will continue our focus on the execution of our plans, bringing forth new treatments to meet patients' needs and remaining responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital.' AstraZeneca last week rejected an improved final offer of £69 billion from Viagra maker Pfizer as at least £5 billion too low. In charge: Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, said the firm will continue to build momentum as an independent company . That was regarded as putting an end to . weeks of intensifying rhetoric over a possible deal ahead of a deadline . today, amid increasing concern over the impact of likely cost-cutting on . UK jobs and the country's science base. The rejection met with discontent from some institutional shareholders, though others supported it. The takeover attempt was formally launched by Pfizer at the end of last month, but hostility to the proposed deal included criticism in some quarters of plans for the newly-merged drugs giant to be redomiciled for tax purposes in the UK while retaining headquarters in New York. And the U.S. drugs giant faced a fierce grilling by MPs in which its Scottish-born chief executive, Ian Read, admitted jobs were likely to be slashed. Many in Westminster are still furious at Pfizer three years after the firm closed its world-leading research plant in Sandwich, Kent - the site where Viagra was invented. Although some jobs were later saved, the 1,500-job cull spelled an end to the careers of many leading scientists. Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, said: 'We note Pfizer's confirmation that it no longer intends to make an offer for AstraZeneca. 'We welcome the opportunity to continue building on the momentum we have already demonstrated as an independent company. 'We are fully focused on the delivery of our strategy. We have attractive growth prospects and a rapidly progressing pipeline. 'In the coming months, we anticipate positive newsflow across our core therapeutic areas, which underpins our confidence in the long-term prospects of the business.' He said the board was grateful to chief executive Pascal Soriot, his management team and to all the company's employees for their dedication and focus over a period of uncertainty. Pfizer had promised to safeguard British jobs in a takeover, but unions dismissed the promise as 'worthless' November 2013: U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer approaches British rival AstraZeneca for first time, and the two firms' senior directors agree to have an initial meeting in January . April 28, 2014: The U.S. firm publicly admits for the first time that it has made an offer for its British rival. An initial bid of £58.7billion had been made in January but was rebuffed . Clash: Pfizer boss Ian Read after a grilling by MPs . May 2: Pfizer sweetens the deal, upping the offer to £63billion. Chief executive Ian Read writes to David Cameron promising to keep jobs in Britain - an offer scorned by unions. Astrazeneca - whose shares have already risen to record levels - rejects the bid after just four hours . May 4: Labour leader Ed Miliband accuses the Prime Minister of 'cheerleading' for the takeover and orders for it to be halted . May 6: Business secretary Vince Cable warns politicians are powerless to stop the takeover because British laws are not robust enough to intervene. Questions are raised over Pfizer's tax status as it emerges the firm paid £118million in corporation tax between 2010 and 2012 – but received a whopping £184million in tax credits . May 10: The Unite and GMB unions announce a mass campaign to block to the bid in the same vein as the campaign against Cadbury's takeover by Kraft . May 13: Pfizer's boss faces a grilling by MPs in which he admits jobs would likely be slashed. At the same time Astrazeneca claims vital cancer drugs could be under threat from the takeover . May 18: AstraZeneca rejects a 'final' £69.3billion takeover bid, sending its own share price plummeting . May 26, 5pm: Deadline for Pfizer to make another final firm offer for Astrazeneca or declare its intent not to do so. Pfizer announces it is walking away from the deal and under British law it cannot try again for six months. Anger: MPs were furious when Pfizer closed its top research plant three years ago in Sandwich, Kent . Mr Johansson said: 'AstraZeneca has a culture of innovation, with science at the heart of everything we do. 'I . believe this will create significant value for our shareholders, . employees and patients who will benefit from our life-changing . medicines.' Tony Burke, assistant general secretary . of the union Unite, said: 'Pfizer failed to convince hardly anyone that . their bid was good for science and would secure skilled jobs and . manufacturing in the UK. 'There can be no room for complacency though. We expect that there will be renewed pressure on shareholders over the coming months with the likelihood that Pfizer could be back in its attempts to take over AstraZeneca. 'The Government needs to use this time to intervene and put a public interest test in place for proposed takeovers of this size, just as other governments do, such as the French, which has strengthened its powers to act to protect strategic industries. 'AstraZeneca's workforce expects shareholders to stand firm, respect their responsibilities and back the board's long-term strategy. 'The future of vital life sciences in the UK and improvements in health are so much more important than the desire of one company to minimise its tax liabilities and wrangles over drug patents. 'This is why we urge the Government to act responsibly and put in place a framework for a public interest test should Pfizer come back for AstraZeneca.'

"A deliberate landslip at a beach in Devon has turned the sea red after tonnes of earth and stone fell into the water. Specialist fire crews helped set off a controlled landslide above the Dawlish to Teignmouth rail track where workmen are battling to reopen the line. The operation has been planned by Network Rail since the storm of February 14 and they have assured the public in the area that there will be no dramatic shift of land. They are working in conjunction with the army who have also been called in to help remove 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes of rock face. The landslip was triggered by pouring water on to the soil and rock above the main railway line so the loose material was brought down and swept into the sea.

"Africa's resources are being exploited by China and it could be a 'disaster' for the environment, a top British wildlife expert has claimed. Chimpanzee expert Dame Jane Goodall compared China to European colonisers when she said the nation is purging the continent of its natural resources, developing mines and oil wells and setting up construction companies. China is also a big market for elephant tusks and rhino horns which has fuelled poaching all over the African continent, she said. Chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall compared . China to European colonisers when she said the nation is purging the . continent of its natural resources, developing mines and oil wells and . setting up construction companies . Dr Goodall, who is almost 80 and made her name researching chimpanzees in Tanzania, said there is little concern for the environment while the rising super-power concerns itself with its own economic growth. However, she did point out that the nation had made changes, highlighting Beijing's recent destruction of illegal ivory stockpiles which, she said, it would never have done 10 years ago. She made the remarks during a series of lectures on threats to earth saying: 'In Africa, China is merely doing what the colonialist did. 'They want raw materials for their economic growth, just as the colonialists were going into Africa and taking the natural resources, leaving people poorer,' she told the AFP news agency. Developing fast: Dr Goodall said China is focused on its economic growth and cares little for the environment . Stockpiles of ivory are seen in Gabon in this undated photo. China is said to be fuelling poaching in Africa . She warned that the impact of the nation's activities on the environment could be 'a disaster' because the country is larger and technology has improved. Dr Goodall is best known for her 45-year study the interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania. She is also the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots & Shoots program, and she has worked to promote conservation and animal welfare issues. In addition, she also works with Chinese children teaching them about conservation and says young people all over the world have a love of nature and animals, including youngsters in China. She also pointed to the 'resilience of nature' and says ecosystems have an ability to bounce back from the brink of destruction.","She said the nation is purging the .

"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. It's a saying that'll be ringing in Queens Park Rangers co-owner Tony Fernandes' ears all summer. The multi-millionaire businessman is due to head into a strategy meeting this week as the club starts preparing for their return to the top-flight. The futures of their current players will be top of the agenda, but their summer recruitment policy will not be far behind. All smiles: QPR's co-owner Tony Fernandes , pictured celebrating Saturday's play-off win, will head the summer strategy meeting . Changes: QPR manager Harry Redknapp knows he has work to do to keep his club in the Premier League . But anyone expecting another money-going-out-of-fashion style spending spree at Loftus Road are likely to be disappointed. Fernandes claims he is wiser after having his fingers burnt during the club's previous Premier League tenure. High transfer fees and high wages spent on the likes of Loic Remy, Park Ji-sung, Julio Cesar and Chris Samba did not work out as planned. Not only that, it has left the club facing a staggering £50million fine for breaching Football League Financial Fair Play regulations. The prospect of such hefty punishment alone will ensure the club are more prudent this summer. Experience: With around 750 club and international appearances Rio Ferdinand would be a high-profile signing . Indeed, sources at Rangers insist the club are keen to stress the days of extravagant spending on high-profile stars are over. The way player contracts are structured is under review, with the club keen to move away from paying high basic salaries; instead moving towards incentive-based deals. QPR officials feel that will help them avoid players who are intent on using Fernandes' riches as a vehicle to earn a quick quid. Such an approach is likely to prove problematic when trying to attract top-level stars to Loftus Road this summer but it is an approach the club are willing to take to ensure they do not sign players who only want a ride on the money train. London: Fulham's Scott Parker could be tempted to join QPR, who can now offer Premier League football . Quality costs nothing: Ferdinand (left) and Joe Cole (right) have both been linked with free transfers to QPR . Manager Harry Redknapp knows he'll need to add some Premier League know-how to his ranks this summer. Fulham midfielder Scott Parker is on Redknapp's radar and out-of-contract stars Joe Cole and Rio Ferdinand could also be targeted. At first glance, QPR would be falling into the same old traps by targeting those three former England players. But the trio have worked under Redknapp before; developing close relationships with the 67-year-old in the process. Gifted: Young talent Ravel Morrison has impressed whilst on loan and could move permanently . Rangers are also considering turning Ravel Morrison's loan deal permanent ahead of next season. Despite not featuring at Wembley on Saturday, there's a willingness to complete a full-time move for the 21-year-old midfielder, who has 12 months left on his West Ham contract. Morrison fits the profile of player Rangers would prefer to target this summer: young, talented and with something to prove. Toon: French striker Loic Remy is unlikely to return to QPR after his loan spell at Newcastle . Before pressing ahead with those moves, Redknapp must decide on which players he wants to keep at the club. Big-earners such as Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermaine Jenas, Bobby Zamora, Stephane Mbia and Andy Johnson are all out of contract this summer. Likewise, players like Remy, Esteban Granero and Adel Taarabt are all due to return to Loftus Road following loan spells away. Remy is set to leave this summer, while Granero and Taarabt are unlikely to feature in Redknapp's plans for next season. There are plenty of questions. We're about to find out the answers. Sales: Both Esteban Granero (left) and Adel Taarabt (right) are unlikely to return at the end of their loan spells .","Tony Fernandes has 'learned lessons' from last time in Premier League .

"'We've all got faults': Mrs Justice Parker, who sits in the . Family Division of the High Court in London, suggested that 'book . learning' was no guarantee of parental success . Intelligence and education do not guarantee good parenting, a senior High Court judge has said. Clever people can make ‘absolutely rotten parents’ and many who fail academically give their children a ‘wonderful upbringing’, Mrs Justice Parker added. In 2006 researchers from Bristol University found social workers had negative attitudes towards parents with learning disabilities – and sometimes broke up loving families with no good reason. Mrs Justice Parker’s warning against assuming the best-educated will make the best parents came during a custody hearing involving a mother with a learning disability. The judge said: ‘Learning disability is not in itself a reason for a parent not looking after a child. ‘Many clever people make absolutely rotten parents and many people who are intellectually impaired … are warm and caring and provide children with a wonderful upbringing. No one is a perfect parent.’ She ruled that the baby in the case should be adopted – not due to his mother’s learning difficulties but because of the ‘emotionally harmful’ effect of his father’s refusal to name him.

Hate crimes against Muslims have soared this year, new figures have shown. Hundreds of anti-Muslim offences have been carried out across the country in 2013, with Britain’s biggest force, the Metropolitan police, recording 500 Islamophobic crimes alone. Many forces reported a surge in the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes following the murder of soldier Lee Rigby by two Islamic extremists in Woolwich, south-east London. And it is feared the figures could be much higher after nearly half of the 43 forces in England and Wales did not reveal how many hate crimes had targeted Muslims - with some forces admitting they do not always record the faith of a religious hate crime victim. Freedom of Information requests were sent by the Press Association to every police force in England and Wales. Of the 43 forces, 24 provided figures on the number of anti-Muslim crimes and incidents recorded. Tell Mama, a group which monitors anti-Muslim incidents, said it had dealt with some 840 cases since April - with the number expected to rise to more than 1,000 by the end of March. This compared with 582 anti-Muslim cases it dealt with from March 2012 to March 2013. Fiyaz Mujhal, director of Faith Matters, which runs the Tell Mama project, said reaction to the murder of Fusilier Rigby had caused the number of Islamophobic crimes to 'significantly jump'. 'The far right groups, particularly the EDL (English Defence League) perniciously use the internet and social media to promote vast amounts of online hate,' he said. Protest: Far right groups such as the English Defence League (EDL) (file photo) use the internet and social media to promote online hate, says Fiyaz Mujhal, director of Faith Matters . Hate: Ukranian born Pavlo Lapshyn murdered of Mohammed Saleem, 82, who he stabbed as . he walked home from prayers, He also planted a series of bombs . outside mosques . Mr Mujhal said tougher sentencing was needed to tackle Islamophobic crime and branded guidelines by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to monitor social media as 'not fit for purpose'. He said: 'They raised the bar of prosecution significantly. Now unless there is a direct threat to somebody on Twitter or Facebook, the CPS will not prosecute. The CPS is just plainly out of sync with reality. 'We also need more robust sentencing. In one case, a pig’s head was left outside a mosque and the perpetrator . came away with a community sentence. Metropolitan Police, recorded 500 . Islamophobic offences from January to mid-November this year, compared . with 336 offences in 2012 and 318 in 2011. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) recorded . nearly double the number of Islamophobic crimes this year - with 130 . offences in 2013 compared with 75 in 2012. The number of Islamophobic offences recorded by Kent police more than trebled this year - from 17 in 2012 to 54 in 2013. Leicestershire Police recorded 31 . anti-Muslim crimes from January to mid-November this year, compared . with 26 anti-Muslim crimes in both 2012 and 2011. Thames Valley Police recorded 39 anti-Muslim crimes to mid-November this year, compared with 20 in 2012 and 31 in 2011. West Mercia Police said 393 race or . faith-related hates crimes were recorded in 2013 which included 25 that . referred to the victim being Muslim. Cheshire Police said they had recorded . seven anti-Muslim hates crimes in 2013 - between April and October - . compared with two in 2012 and one in 2011. Cleveland Police said they were unable . to provide figures for anti-Muslim hate crimes because the information . “is not generally recorded”, as the force records ethnicity not . religion. Merseyside Police recorded 10 anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2013, compared with six in 2012 and eight in 2011. West Yorkshire Police have recorded 37 anti-Muslim crimes in 2013 to November, compared with 24 in 2012, and 17 in 2011. Humberside Police recorded 15 anti-Muslim hates this . year compared with four in 2012 and two in 2011. Warwickshire . Police recorded two anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2013, while City of . London Police recorded three Islamaphobic offences. Nottinghamshire Police saw the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes double this year, from five in 2012 to 10 in 2013. 'When you target a mosque, you are targeting the whole community.' Tell . Mama has called for police forces to introduce a system which improves . monitoring of Islamophobic crimes, after some forces admitted officers . do not always record the faith of a religious hate crime victim. 'There are three problems we come across,' Mr Mujhal said. 'Firstly, there is a lack of understanding of the language of Islamophobia thrown at victims in any incidents. 'Secondly, there is very little training on how to ask relevant questions to pull out anti-Muslim cases. 'Thirdly, recording processes are not in line with each other. One force will allow an officer to flag an incident as anti-Muslim, another force will flag it as religious hate crime. There is no uniformity. 'There must be guidelines for all forces so we can know the level of the problem.' Just five days after arriving in the country, Pavlo Lapshyn, 25, killed 82-year-old Muslim pensioner Mohammed Saleem because he hated 'non-whites' and wanted to start a race war. The PhD student also ordered bomb-making materials online as he plotted mass murder in a series of mosque attacks. Lapshyn told police that he had wanted to stab him in the heart and while he was at large for the killing, he planted three bombs near mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton in the West Midlands. He was jailed for 40 years. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) has previously said 71 incidents were reported to its national community tension team (NCTT) over five days after Fusilier Rigby was murdered on May 22. Superintendent Paul Giannasi, Acpo’s spokesman on hate crime, said: 'We would obviously want overall crime levels to reduce and to see fewer victims, but we welcome increases in reported hate crime, as long as they are a sign of increased confidence of victims to report. 'We are working with local police forces, to help improve the way we respond to hate crime and to provide robust and transparent hate crime data.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'These are despicable crimes that devastate lives and communities. 'The courts already hand out tougher punishments where race or religion are found to be aggravating factors. 'The number of people receiving a custodial sentence for these appalling crimes is higher than ever before.' A CPS spokeswoman said: 'Online communication can be offensive, shocking or in bad taste. 'However, as set out in CPS guidelines on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media, content has to be more than simply offensive to be contrary to the criminal law. 'In order to preserve the right to free speech the threshold for prosecution must be high and only communications that are grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false are prohibited by the legislation.'","Metropolitan Police saw 500 incidents from January to mid-November compared to 336 incidents in 2012 .

The temple is best known for the towering Pyramids of the Moon and the Sun. The complex of pyramids, plazas, temples and avenues was once the center of a city of more than 100,000 inhabitants and may have been the largest and most influential city in pre-Hispanic North America at the time. But nearly 2,500 years after the city was founded - and about 2,100 years after the Teotihuacan culture began to flourish there - very little is known about the identity of its rulers.

No depiction of a ruler, or the tomb of a monarch, has ever been found, setting the metropolis apart from other pre-Hispanic cultures that deified their rulers. Vertical excavations begun in 2009 to reach the mouth of the tunnel suggest it was a ruler's tomb, archaeologist Sergio Gomez said in 2010. Rich offerings were tossed into the tunnel at the moment it was closed up, including almost 50,000 objects of jade, stone, shell and pottery, including ceramic beakers of a kind never found before at the site. The city was abandoned by the time the Aztecs arrived in the area in the 1300s and gave it the name 'Teotihuacan,' which means 'the place where men become gods.'

"A rare British car could fetch a small fortune after being unearthed lying untouched for years in a barn. The Doretti was found by mechanic Martin Hamlyn-White, in Hennock, Devon, who didn’t have a clue how valuable it was. There were only ever 245 Dorettis made by The Swallow Coachbuiding Company of Staffordshire and until a few days ago the whereabouts of just 179 were known.

The Swallow Coachbuiding Company of Staffordshire and until a few days . ago the whereabouts of just 179 were known. The car is pictured in the barn when it was found . That number is now 180 after the shock find by Mr Hamlyn-White. It belonged to a pair of farming brothers who used it up until the mid 1970s. It is now set to be auctioned on February 21 and despite needing restoration could fetch £20,000 or more. It has already attracted massive worldwide interest which is growing. Mechanic Mr Hamlyn-White was called in to assess the vehicle by auctioneers Rendells after the death of the car’s owner. He said: 'I had no idea what the car . was and absolutely shocked to hear they can go for so much money. I was . thinking perhaps it was a few hundred pounds’ worth. It took a while to . find out what it was because they are so rare. 'Eventually . it became clear it was this long lost make of car. It’s not in bad . condition - it has an aluminium body so that’s not corroded. 'I was quite impressed with the chassis. I didn’t think there’d be much left of it to be honest but actually it’s pretty solid. Classic: The car belonged to a pair of farming brothers who used it up until the mid 1970s . Worldwide appeal: The car is now set to be auctioned on February . 21 and despite needing restoration, it could fetch £20,000 or more. It has . already attracted massive worldwide interest which is growing . 'It will be a great project for somebody. It will be fascinating to see how it turns out if it does get restored.' Production of the Doretti ran from 1954-55 with the car based on the Triumph TR2. It was targeted at the Californian market the name a marketing ploy to appeal to the Americans’ love of all things ltalian. The 1991cc engine was a straight four fed by twin SUs and the four-speed gearbox could be had with an optional overdrive. David Ship of Rendells said there had already been interest from Australia, Europe, America and the UK. 'It took us several days to identify it because parts that look like an AC and others like a Triumph,” he said. 'We finally found the paperwork, however, and there’s a lot of interesting ephemera that comes with the car. Auction: Rendells said there had already been interest from Australia, Europe, America and the UK . Rare: The car is right-hand drive which is rare and the car was re-registered in 1965 hence its C-plate . It’s right hand drive too which is rare. Sadly I don’t have the original log book and for some reason it was re-registered in 1965, hence the C plate. 'This is going to be a very interesting project for someone.' He said the thrill of a genuine barn find was rare. 'I’ve only ever had four in my 30-year career. Once I discovered a Lanchester that had been bricked up during the war. 'We couldn’t work out why the garage interior was too short but then we went through the wall and discovered the car which had been put there at a time when everything had to be submitted as scrap metal for the war effort. Project: Auctioneers hope the car will be an interesting project for someone to work on . Restoration: If the car was spruced up it could be worth at least £50,000 to £60,000 . 'It’s always good fun and the best thing when you find something as rare as the Doretti is that there will be international interest. 'I’ve recently seen a badly restored example on offer with a guide price of £11000 to £12000. A Doretti in the States fetched the equivalent of £120,000. 'It’s hard to say what it will fetch but if someone was to spend £20,000 restoring it they would have a car worth at least £50,000 to £60,000 - maybe double that.' Also unearthed at the Hennock property which had lain untouched for years were two rotting Triumph Spitfires, a Reliant Scimitar, a restorable Triumph XR2 and two VW Polos. A Triumph 2.5Pi is still there but the building it’s in has collapsed making retrieval a health and safety nightmare. Elsewhere in the extensive grounds are the remains of several other cars too, now nothing more than scrap.","Doretti was found by mechanic Martin Hamlyn-White, in Hennock, Devon .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans has spoken out saying he is 'ashamed' of his actions - but has expressed no remorse for the crime and continues to protest his innocence. The footballer, who was released from prison on Friday after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a woman in a hotel room, has said that cheating on his girlfriend was 'unforgivable' and that he wishes he could 'turn back the clock'. But the 25-year-old has maintained that the sex was consensual. Scroll down for video . Convicted rapist Ched Evans has said he is 'ashamed' of his actions and wishes he could 'turn back the clock' on the May 2011 hotel room incident, but has continued to protest his innocence . Evans has said cheating on his girlfriend, Natasha Massey, pictured, was 'unforgivable' Spokeswoman for Rape Crisis charity Katie Russell has said Evans' comments are harmful and insulting to his victim, for whom she said he had never shown any regard. Evans, who was convicted of rape by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court two years ago, told the Sunday Mirror: 'It was something that should never have happened. And it is something that I will regret for the rest of my life. I cheated on my girlfriend and had sex with this girl - but it was definitely consensual.' Evans' mother, Helen Roberts said her son was 'buzzing' and will return home with 'all guns blazing to prove his innocence'. His family and girlfriend Natasha Massey - who has a led a campaign to have Evans conviction overturned - were to throw a coming home party for him. Ms Roberts said that her son's critics didn't know all the facts. She told the Daily Star: 'We just hope the feminist gang will soon find something else to go and bang their drum about.' Ms Massey has led a campaign to have Evans conviction overturned; his case is to be reviewed by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks . Evans, who was jailed in April 2012 for the rape in Rhyl, North Wales, admitted having sex with the woman but she told the jury she had no memory of the incident. The prosecution said the 19-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse. An appeal against Evans' conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012 but it is due to be reviewed by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks. Cases normally take several months to be dealt with by the commission, but Evans' case is being fast tracked due to 'issues raised' by his legal team. The commission said that was not a reflection of the strength of his case. The request was in line with their 'policy on prioritisation' and 'the facts of the case'. Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge. Debate has raged during the past week about whether the former Sheffield United player should be able to return to football. Many Blades fans have called for Evans to be rehabilitated but almost 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to take him back. The victim is captured on CCTV at the hotel, where she had initially gone with McDonald . The victim is seen leaving the hotel; Evans case is being looked at by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks and has been fast tracked following 'issues raised' by his legal team . TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm' during a panel discussion on ITV's Loose Women. Her comments caused a wave of criticism, abuse on social media and led to threats being made against her daughter, fitness instructor Chloe. Yesterday Sheffield United said they had not offered Evans a new contract. In a statement, the club dismissed the report as 'speculative' adding: 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long-term decision about Ched Evans.' TV presenter and Sheffield United patron Charlie Webster, who revealed in an interview earlier this year she was sexually assaulted as a teenager, said she will quit her role with the club if they re-sign Evans. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name, under my club or community. 'He says he is innocent, he has shown no remorse.' She was immediately branded a 'hypocrite' by Evans' sister Kylie, who retweeted a message in which the sports presenter posted last month saying she wanted to get a photograph of former heavyweight boxing champion and convicted rapist Mike Tyson. He was convicted of rape in 1992 after an incident the previous year and subsequently served three years of a six-year sentence. Miss Webster, 31, later said she was now 'not proud of' her Tyson tweet. In May 2011, Evans had been out with his brother and a friend of his, along with McDonald. The group went to a bar and then had a kebab. Evans said McDonald decided to go back to his hotel and hailed a cab, at which point the victim appeared and asked to go with him. Evans took a separate taxi with his brother and his brother's friend, but then received a text from McDonald saying he had 'got a girl'.

"A woman who stabbed her boyfriend after a string of temper tantrums was jailed for life for his murder today. Alexia Heckles, 35, got drunk then knifed former boxer Scott Dunne in the heart during an argument after she said she was going on holiday to Spain without him. She was arrested after neighbours heard her screaming and shouting and furniture being upturned and called 999. Murder: Alexia Heckles, 35, got drunk then . knifed former boxer Scott Dunne (both pictured) in the heart during an argument after . she said she was going on holiday to Spain without him. She has been convicted of murder . Police found her so hysterical and aggressive officers had to restrain the mother of two with handcuffs. She was searched and was found to have her boyfriend’s s blood spattered bank card hidden in her bra. Mr Dunne, 41, a father of three - who had been in a relationship with Heckles for three years and had a child with her - suffered fatal injuries in the attack and died at the scene. In the run up to the killing, neighbours in an apartment block where the feuding couple lived in Bradford, West Yorkshire, said they heard so many rows through the paper thin walls, they became used to Heckles’ 'loud angry voice for hour after hour'. A year before the tragedy police had already arrested Heckles on suspicion of assault amid claims she stabbed Mr Dunne in the neck with a smashed wine bottle. Although Mr Dunne told medical staff he had been attacked bye his girlfriend, the case was dropped after he changed his story and said he had been injured when he was 'jumped' while walking home from a party late at night. Assault: A year before the tragedy police had . already arrested Heckles on suspicion of assault amid claims she stabbed . Mr Dunne in the neck with a smashed wine bottle - but this was later dropped . Five months later Mr Dunne himself was arrested outside the flat after Heckles complained he had punched her several times in her bedroom. The case was also dropped after Heckles appeared to taunt Mr Dunne from the doorway of their flat as officer took him away. He later told police: 'She thinks she is the victim. She loses the plot sometimes.' At Bradford Crown Court Heckles denied murder but was convicted after a week long trial. She refused to enter the dock to listen to the unanimous verdict being returned by the jury. The court heard she had 41 previous convictions, and served three jail terms for offences including, robbery, intimidating a witness, wounding and assault. Ordering her to serve a minimum of 12 years in jail the judge Mr Justice Jeremy Stuart-Smith said the killing occurred after Mr Dunne had the knife and dropped it. He added: 'She picked it up and the stabbing occurred moments later. The decision to pick up the knife must therefore be treated as spontaneous. 'I accept that she did not set out that evening with the intent of killing Mr Dunne or casing him serious bodily harm. But this was not a stab that was meant to just wound- it was meant to kill. It was an intention that was formed in the heat of the moment in the context of a prolonged domestic argument. 'I recognise her relationship with him was extremely complicated and volatile and that such relationships may sap a woman's will to get away. 'The physical violence was not just one way. I accept that Mr Dunne abused her physically on occasion.' The killing occurred on January 18 during yet another late night bust up at the couple’s flat. During the evening neighbours heard raised voices and recognised the sound of Heckles shouting and of furniture being tipped over and thrown around. It went quiet for ten minutes and then Heckles was seen outside, screaming and with her hands covered in blood with one eye witness saying it was as if she 'wearing red gloves.' Rows: Neighbours told the court that the pair constantly argued and they often heard screaming and shouting coming from their flat. The killing occurred on January 18 after yet another row at their flat . A 16-year-old neighbour, whose statement was read out in court, said he could hear lots of domestic arguments from the flat. 'There were constant arguments, with screaming and shouting,' he said. On the night of the stabbing, he was woken by a woman screaming: 'No, Scott, no.' He saw her outside her home with blood on her hands, crying and asking for help. The teenager went into the flat to see if Mr Dunne was hurt. He saw him face down on the bedroom floor with a pool of blood seeping from under him. The youth said there was a faint pulse on Mr Dunne’s neck. He shouted his name and rubbed his back to try to revive him, before running back to his flat to get help. When the police arrived, Heckles struggled with officers and was handcuffed. Holiday: Heckles told the jury the couple argued as she was due to fly out to Spain with her mother for a month’s holiday . Later at the police station she was 'aggressive and hysterical, her breath smelt of intoxicants and her eyes were glazed.' She banged her head on the floor and screamed: 'Tell me he’s not dead,' and was also heard repeatedly shouting: 'No, no, no, why would I hurt him. He’s the father of my baby' as officers try to calm her. When she was taken to a cell immediately afterwards, Mr Dunne’s bloodstained bank debit card was found hidden in her bra. It emerged Heckles stabbed Mr Dunne with a kitchen knife with a 19cm blade. Andrew . Kershaw prosecuting said: 'She held it firmly and she used severe force . so that it cut completely through one rib, a part of his lung and . through the left ventricle of his heart, causing a fatal wound almost as . long as the blade of the the knife. She then removed the knife which . would also have needed a severe amount of force.' A pathologist said Mr Dunne died from blood loss after the knife blade pierced his heart with 'severe downward force.' It . was believed she took Mr Dunne’s wallet from his jeans pocket as he lay . dying, removed his bank debit card while her fingers were wet with his . blood, and hid it in her bra. When . interviewed by the police, Heckles said Mr Dunne had pushed her in the . living room. He then came into the bedroom looking angry, with two . knives. She said she had acted in self defence and the wounding was an . accident saying: 'It was tragic, tragic accident in a tight space in a . split second scenario. He came towards me. I protected myself.' Heckles told the jury the couple argued as she was due to fly out to Spain with her mother for a month’s holiday. She said she knew Mr Dunne would be upset and took pleasure in letting him know she was going away. She also told him the relationship was over and repeatedly asked him to leave and then went into the bedroom. She claimed: 'The door flew open and Scott appeared. He had a small knife in his left hand and a large knife in his right hand. I said ‘What are you doing with those knives?’ He threw down the smaller knife. I was in front of the bedside table. He came towards me and I went towards him at the same time. He held the knife in front of him. 'I didn’t really have much time to think. I was scared and I wanted some control of the knife. I went to grab his right arm and he pushed me with his shoulder back on to the bed.' She said he dropped the knife during a struggle and added: 'I picked it up because I was scared of what he was going to do with it,' she added. 'I wanted to remove it and leave the flat. I accept that I stabbed him. It was an accident. I never meant it to happen.'","Alexia Heckles got drunk then .

"A man needed 80 stitches in his face after being hit by a chunk of ice the size of a football which fell hundreds of feet from the New York skyscraper. Barry Negron said he saw ice hanging . perilously off a four-story building near Rockefeller Center last month and tried to warn pedestrians when he was hit in the face with the falling shard. He was left with bloody cuts across his nose and cheek and needed 80 stitches. Mr Negron is one of millions of city dwellers across the U.S. who are risking life and limb from tumbling ice shards, which can fall at speeds of 100mph, as the nation endures one of the most brutal winters on record. Injured: Barry Negron holds a tissue to his face after being struck by ice falling off a four story building in New York. He needed 80 stitches after being hit with a chunk of ice the size of a football . Streets around New York's new 1 . World Trade Center, the nation's tallest building, were recently closed . when sheets of ice were seen shearing from the face of the 1,776-foot . structure. Sidewalks around high-rises in cities . big and small have been cordoned off with yellow caution tape because of . falling icicles and rock-hard chunks of frozen snow. Now experts are warning the situation could get worse over the next few days as a thaw sets in over much of the country. Mr Negron said: 'I . panicked because I saw blood on my hands, and more coming down,' said . the 27-year-old salesman. As he lay on the pavement, he said: 'I heard . two young ladies yelling, 'Oh, my God, oh my God, help! There's a lot of . blood!'' Since then, he's . nervous when he walks around the city and has seen other near-hits. 'I . look at my scars, and I say, 'Why did this have to happen to me?'' Danger: Pedestrians pass a sign warning them of falling ice near City Hall in New York. The ice shards can fall at speeds of around 100mp and have devastating consequences for pedestrians . Joey Picca, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in New York, said: 'The snow starts to melt and the liquid drips off and makes bigger and bigger icicles, or chunks of ice that break off skyscrapers.' New York has had 48.5 inches of snow this winter and several cycles of freeze and thaw. 'Be very, very aware of your surroundings,' he said. 'If you see ice hanging from a building, find another route. Don't walk under hanging ice.' Some architects say newer, energy-efficient high-rises may actually be making the problem worse. 'They keep more heat inside, which means the outside is getting colder and that allows more snow and ice to form.' said engineer Roman Stangl, founder of the consulting firm Northern Microclimate in Cambridge, Ontario. Stangl helps developers opt for shapes, slope angles and even colors - darker colors absorb more melting sunrays —-to diminish ice formation. High-tech materials can be also be used, such as at Tokyo's Skytree observation tower, where heaters were embedded in the glass to melt the ice. Such options are not always possible in older cities with balconies, awnings and stone details. Cordon: Police guard a closed pedestrian walkway next to 1 World Trade Center which was recently cordoned off so pedestrians could avoid injury from falling ice . Exactly how many pedestrians are hit by falling ice is not clear, but dozens of serious injuries are reported annually. It's a perennial problem in St. Petersburg, Russia, where dozens reportedly are injured or killed every year. Seven people were hurt in 2011 near Dallas when huge sheets of ice slid off the roof of Cowboys Stadium. Fifteen people were injured in 2010 by a shower of ice from the 37-story Sony Building on New York's Madison Avenue. Outside Chicago's 100-story John Hancock Center last month, people scrambled with backpacks and purses over their heads to avoid falling ice. On Tuesday, signs warning pedestrians of falling ice stood outside nearly every skyscraper and other tall building in Chicago's Loop as temperatures pushed above freezing for the first time in weeks.  Last week near New York's Carnegie Hall, at the same under-construction condo tower where a crane dangled during Superstorm Sandy, chunks of ice tumbled onto cars and buses. 'This happens all over the country, all over the world, in cold climates,' said architect Chris Benedict, who accounts for ice buildup in designing new structures. New York City's Department of Buildings has issued an alert asking building owners to clear dangerous buildups of snow and rope off sidewalks, and they have issued citations with a standard penalty of $1,000 for those failing to do so. But even the simplest solutions can sometimes be problematic. After ice was seen falling from 1 World Trade Center earlier this month, officials closed a nearby street and the entrance to the underground PATH train station that links New York with New Jersey. That caused a logjam of thousands of commuters with nowhere to go. Anthony Hayes, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey that owns the trade center site, said crews have been removing the accumulation of ice that formed on the 1 World Trade Center and on an external construction hoist that stretches from the ground to the 90th floor. A new covered entrance to the PATH station now protects commuters walking by. 'Hey, what do you want? It's winter, that's what happens — ice,' said Mike McKenna, a 38-year-old management consultant who was under 1 World Trade Center when the chunks first started flying. 'It was a mess,"" he said. ""But I went through 9/11. Falling ice is nothing.'","Barry Negron said he saw ice hanging .

"Killed: Zbigniew Lyson, 43, died at his home in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, on Saturday from severe burns . Firefighters have admitted they might have reacted faster to help a man who died after apparently dousing himself in petrol before setting fire to his home had they not been on strike. Zbigniew Lyson, 43, died from severe burns after he was pulled from the burning building by . firefighters and taken to Whitechapel . Hospital, London. His house, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, was engulfed in flames at 2pm . on Saturday just hours into the latest round of strike action taken by . firefighters over pensions. Several neighbours claimed Mr Lyson started the fire by dousing himself and his family in petrol. Today the fire service admitted it . could have reacted faster if the crew closest to the scene of the blaze . 400 yards away at Welwyn Station hadn't been on strike. It took another working crew 10 minutes to reach the property. A spokesman for the Hertfordshire Fire . and Rescue Service said: 'Had . the strike not been on, the response most likely would have been faster . but the attendance time of 10 minutes is within our targets to respond . from the first call.' 'However, . it is unclear at the moment if the outcome would have been different as . the crew may have been at another incident, or the other side of . Hatfield.' He added that . the Welwyn station, which has one full-time fire engine and a retained . engine, was not 'operational' at the time of the blaze. Mr Lyson is thought to have worked at Ocado and moved to the UK from his home in Andrychów, Poland. It . is believed he poured petrol on himself, locked the doors and windows . and then set the three-bedroom end terraced house alight. Locals said his wife and three children managed to escape but he remained inside. Hertfordshire . Fire and Rescue Service said that the first fire engine reached the . blazing house within its ten-minute target time. They said it was sent from an undisclosed location around two miles away where it was based because of the strike. A spokesman said the initial call was received at 1.59pm and the first engine arrived on scene at 2.09pm. Strike: . Firefighters have admitted that they could have got to the scene of this blaze in Welwyn Garden City faster if they hadn't been on strike. Zbigniew Lyson died on . Saturday from severe burns . Scene: Investigators were today at the site of the fire trying to determine what caused it. Petrol is believed to be involved according to the neighbours . Neighbours said police asked them whether they saw the father-of-three take petrol into the house. Pensioner John Ephgrave, 75, said: 'I heard that he doused himself in petrol and his wife and children. He went upstairs then his wife and children managed to escape. 'There was two loud explosions and it went on for a long time because our fire brigade was on strike.' Mother-of-two . Brenda O'Neill, 47, said: 'It was awful. I came back home while it was . still going on. 'They put the fire out but then it reignited. 'Apparently . he locked all the doors and window. The wife was covered in petrol when . she came out. The police asked me if I saw him bringing petrol in the . house but I didn't see it. 'There was definitely an accelerant in there. We smelt smoke and the next thing you know it was up in flames. 'I would never have imagined that he would do that. They were a nice, quiet family. They always looked happy.' Nearby: Welwyn Fire Station is just 400 yards from the charred house . Idle: Welwyn fire station was not operational when firefighters were called to Mr Lyson's house . Damage: The home was devastated by the fire, which firefighters say they still reached within a 10 minute timeframe . Today police and fire investigators were . at the charred home in the residential street of Heronswood Road, Welwyn . Garden City, Hertfordshire, to find out what caused the inferno. Del Macleod, chairman of the Hertfordshire FBU branch, said striking firefighters were not at the nearby station at the time of the fire. 'Hertfordshire Fire Service does not permit staff to stay on their premises when striking,' he said. Mr Macleod said it was a 'difficult time' for everyone involved and said all the thoughts of the crews were with . the family of the man who died. He added that on a normal day there . was a good chance a crew would have been available to attend to the fire . from the nearby station, but it was 'not guaranteed.' A . post mortem examination is to be carried out on the dead man’s body to . establish the exact cause of his death and an inquest will be opened and . adjourned. Mr Lyson died during Saturday's Fire Brigades Union (FBU) strike, the latest exchange between firefighters and the Government over plans to raise retirement ages. Firefighters across the country walked out from 10am until 5pm over the weekend - the 14th sch strike since a campaign of industrial action started in September. Members of the FBU are protesting plans to hike pension contributions and increase the age of retirement for firemen from 55 to 60. Union leaders say that stringent fitness tests could mean that older firefighters could be forced to quit if they fail, which could lead to their pensions being slashed. Only firefighters in England and Wales took part in this weekend's strike. The FBU has struck a deal with the Northern Irish government, which agreed to keep the retirement age at 55. Services made back-up plans for the strikes, but admitted they would not be able to respond to every 999 call.","Fire .

"A great-grandmother who lost her wedding ring more than 42 years ago is overjoyed after finding it buried just two inches below soil in her garden.

Despite searching for the ring for years, she and husband William finally accepted they would never see it again. Reunited: Marion Reeve, 79, from East Halton, North . Lincolnshire, lost her wedding ring back in 1971, while hanging out the . washing in her back garden but a metal detector found it after 42 years . But almost half a century on, Mrs Reeve has been reunited with the ring - after a family friend asked to try out their new metal detector in her garden. She said: 'It was so emotional when I got my ring back. I just couldn’t believe it. It was brilliant and I honestly thought it was gone forever. 'I was not exactly sure where I had lost it all those years ago. I had been hanging out the washing in the orchard, but it could have been anywhere.' Mrs Reeve lost her wedding ring 15 years after marring farmer William Reeve, and the couple, who have three children, would occassionally search for the ring throughout the years. Lost and found: Mrs Reeve lost her wedding ring 15 years after marrying her husband William Reeve and the couple have three children . Mrs Reeve, who was married to her husband for 54 years, before he passed away four years ago, said: 'People say it is bad luck to lose a wedding ring, but William said it did not matter.' But four decades after losing it, family friend and metal detector enthusiast Chris Blackburn, 34, from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, discovered the gold ring, just two inches below the soil in her back garden. He said: 'It was in remarkably good condition. The family have thanked me, but just finding it was a reward in itself and to see the look on Marion’s face.' Mr Blackburn became friends with Mrs Reeve's eldest son Neville and would regularly scour land belonging to the family with his metal detector- although he only ever found old cans or small bits of metal. During the festive period Mr Blackburn came to have another look and miraculously discovered the missing ring. Mrs Reeve was upstairs sorting clothes when she looked out of the window and saw Mr Blackburn digging. She said: 'I thought ‘Has he found a body?’ 'Then when he came into the house and said ‘Is this yours?’ I went a bit emotional.' Mrs Reeve's son Neville said: 'It had only been a couple of inches in the ground. He struck lucky. He was over the moon. It was in remarkably good condition considering it had been there 42 years. 'It is really good news. It had been lost all those years are we searched everywhere as children and never managed to find it. 'It is a miracle.'","Marion Reeve, 79, and her late husband William accepted they would never see the ring again after she lost it in their back garden .

Hill in Brockworth, Gloucester, today and the main race was won by local . man Josh Shepherd. The . 19-year-old, from Brockworth, said: 'It was really good. I’m over the . moon - it’s thrilling to win an event I’ve grown up watching.' As well as the pride of his village, Josh has also won the 8lb wheel of Double Gloucester cheese to take home and eat. Ryan Fairley, 24, won one of the races for the second year in a row, and walked away with the prize - despite not liking cheese.

An ambulance was called to the foot of the hill as the screaming man was carried halfway down the steep slope. An onlooker said: 'It really looked quite bad. He was in a lot of pain. You could really tell it was broken. It just looked wrong, like his foot was in the wrong place.' Police road closures meant that onlookers had to walk more than two miles to get to the hill. An onlooker said: 'It’s great keeping local traditions alive, and the thousands of people here just goes to show that we want the right to roll cheeses whenever, and wherever, we want. 'The police were a joke, making us park miles away. But nothing will stop cheese-rolling. 'Even last year when we didn’t have any cheese, the event went ahead.'

Last year, the cheese-rolling even used a fake Double Gloucester made from wood when cheesemaker Diana Smart, 87, was banned by police from providing a wheel for the event. Mrs Smart made all seven wheels of Double Gloucester for this year’s event. She said: 'I’ve always thought it was something worthwhile doing. I think it’s a good thing. It was a great shame they felt they had to stop it.' In total, four cheeses weighing around three kilograms each and three smaller ones, weighing around one-and-a-half kilograms, were used in the event, which had a women’s race and a children’s event. A Dutch contingent of cheese makers gathered on the hill with wheels of Gouda they had generously brought for the event, in case there were any difficulties with the Double Gloucester. In 2013, the event was won by American army veteran Kenny Rackers, then aged 27, and injuries included a broken leg. The event was cancelled in 2011 after organisers said they had been threatened with violence after plans to sell tickets costing £20 for a two-day event were announced. A spokesman for Great Western Ambulance said they were not involved in the event, and St John Ambulance declined to comment, as they too were uninvolved.","Several runners were injured during the annual Gloucestershire event where participants try to catch a cheese .

"A young George W. Bush once had a . blind date with the daughter of President Richard Nixon - but the romantic liaison didn't go as well as his father might have hoped. The elder Bush was a member of the House of Representatives . from Texas in the late 1960s when he arranged for his son to take Tricia Nixon to dinner. Bush recalls the incident in an anecdote-filled book being released this week about his father, former president George H.W. Bush, called '41 - A Portrait of My Father.' Scroll down for video . George W. Bush describes the unfortunate blind date his father set up with Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia . He describes how as a young man he made his first-ever . trip to the White House to pick Tricia up - but the date seemed doomed from that point onward. 'During dinner, I reached for some butter, knocked over a . glass, and watched in horror as the stain of red wine crept . across the table,' George W. writes. 'Then I fired up a cigarette, prompting a . polite suggestion from Tricia that I not smoke,' he wrote. 'The . date came to an end when she asked me to take her back to the . White House immediately after dinner.' The book also deals with the heart-wrenching moment that Bush learned that his little sister Robin had died from leukemia aged just three years old. The elder Bush was a member of the House of Representativesfrom Texas in the late 1960s when he arranged for his son to take Tricia Nixon (pictured) to dinner . George W. Bush pictured with his father and his little sister Robin, who died from leukemia aged just three . In an extract published in The Times, Bush writes that he has a 'vivid memory' of that day, when his parents arrived at his school in the middle of the day seven months after Robin had been diagnosed. 'As I sprinted over to the car, I thought that I saw Robin's blond curls in the backseat,' he continues. 'I was so excited that she had come home. But when I got to the car, she wasn't there. 'Mother hugged me tight and told me that she was gone. On the drive home, I saw my parents cry for the first time.' Bush calls the book, named 41 because his father was the 41st president, a 'love story' about his father. George W. Bush is pictured here with his sister Robin as a baby, alongside two of his brothers . In it, he writes of the family's concern when the elder Bush . declared his intention to go on a parachute jump to mark his . 90th birthday earlier this year. Asked what his birthday wish . was as he prepared to jump, George H.W. Bush said: 'Make sure . the parachute opens.' Bush also writes that . his father, who was in the White House from 1988 to 1992 and his staff should have been more active in . explaining to Americans why he broke his 'no new taxes' pledge . as part of a 1990 budget agreement. Bush relays the stories in an anecdote-filled book about George H.W. Bush . The issue seriously hurt the .

'By taking the issue to the people, a president can build up . public support and change minds in Washington,' George W. writes. 'Unfortunately, . George Bush did not do that for the budget agreement of 1990, . and the bitterness that resulted from his broken pledge damaged . his standing within the party.' Another section dealing with Vladimir Putin shows that Bush Snr was continuing to play a part on the world stage well into his 80s. Although the two almost talk politics, George W Bush would still use his father to help host world leaders - such as Putin in 2007, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report. In an excerpt from the book, Bush told how he asked his father to invite Putin to the family compound at Walker's Point, Maine, so the two leaders could talk about missile defense programs. In a surreal episode, Bush Snr, then 83, took Putin into the Atlantic on a speedboat. While the idea 'startled' the Russian leader at first, he 'loved' being driven at top-speed by the octogenarian politician when the time came. Elsewhere the book shows how a shocked Bush Snr told President Nixon to resign after learning he would lose an impeachment hearing over revelations he lied to the American people. Bush Snr, then chairman of the Republican National Committee, sent a letter to Nixon urging him quit for his own good and that of the country, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report. It said: 'I now firmly feel that resignation is best for this country, best for this President... If you do leave office, history will properly record your achievements with a lasting respect'. The elder Bush had a serious illness two years ago. In December 2012, he was hospitalized with pneumonia. The . family feared the worst and gathered at his bedside. The elder . Bush put his hand on granddaughter Jenna's pregnant belly and . said, 'There's death and there's new life.' 'We all left the room sobbing,' Bush writes. George W.

It ‘started with a faint sound like a car pulling up outside the house then sounded like a large truck’, said one resident. Others reported hearing a 'boom' sound. There are 200-300 earthquakes in Britain every year, but most are so small no one notices them. Between 20 and 30 each year are over 2.0 magnitude and can be felt across a wider area.

"Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, worth an estimated $65 billion, is in the process of using all of that money in hopes of extending the lives of others. His next plan of action: eradicating poliomyelitis, a viral disease that has taken a countless number of lives. At 57, Gates, a college dropout, says he wants to do more for others and sees this as one way of giving back to the world that made him so successful. Ambitious man: Billionaire Bill Gates plans to will spend $1.8¿billion in the next six years in an attempt to eradicate polio, a viral disease that has taken a countless number of lives . Emblematic: Gates believes the eradication of polio will inspire countries to take greater efforts to lower child death rates . ‘I’m certainly well taken care of in terms of food and clothes,’ he told the Telegraph in London. ‘Money has no utility to me beyond a certain point. Its utility is entirely in building an organization and getting the resources out to the poorest in the world.’ Gates will deliver the BBC’s Dimbleby Lecture later this month, using the value of young human beings as his central theme. In that speech he will talk about every child having the right to a healthy and productive life. He will also explain how technology and innovation can help the world reach that goal. So far Gates and his wife Melinda, 48, have given away $28 billion of their fortune through their charitable foundation, with more than $8 billion of it to improving global health. ‘My wife and I had a long dialogue about how we were going to take the wealth that we’re lucky enough to have and give it back in a way that’s most impactful to the world,’ Gates told the Telegraph’s Neil Tweedie. ‘We’re focused on the help of the poorest in the world, which really drives you into vaccination. You can actually take a disease and get rid of it altogether, like we are doing with polio.’ Polio vaccination: Nurse Agnes from Bwindi Community Hospital in Uganda prepares a polio vaccination at an outreach clinic in Kitahurira . Polio victim: Bismillah Gul, 12, suffering from polio is carried by his father Masta Gul at the International Committee of the Red Cross orthopedic center on November 19, 2012 in Kabul, Afghanistan . Some 12 million children under the age of five died ten years ago in 1992, while in 2011 the number of child deaths was just under seven million, or 19,000 per day, according to statistics from the United Nations. The leading causes of death are pneumonia at 18 per cent, pre-birth complications at 14 per cent, diarrhoea at 11 per cent, complications during birth at nine per cent and malaria at seven per cent. A September report from the United Nations Children's Fund stated that four-fifths of ‘under-five deaths’ in 2011 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. ‘Given the prospect that these regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa, will account for the bulk of the world's births in the next years, we must give new impetus to the global momentum to reduce under-five deaths,’ UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in the report. For Gates, getting rid of polio is emblematic in that effort. The eradication of the disease that affects the nerves and can lead to partial or full paralysis will inspire countries to take greater efforts to lower child death rates, he believes. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will spend another $1.8 billion in the next six years to accomplish the couple's goal. ‘All you need is over 90 per cent of children to have the vaccine drop three times and the disease stops spreading,’ said Gates. ‘The number of cases eventually goes to zero. ‘When we started, we had over 400,000 children a year being paralyzed and we are now down to under 1,000 cases a year. The great thing about finishing polio is that we’ll have resources to get going on malaria and measles.’ Charitable efforts: So far Gates and his wife Melinda, center, have given away $28 billion of their fortune through their charitable foundation, with more than $8 billion of it to improving global health .","Gates, 57, says he .

"An international poker player has been awarded $340,000 to be paid by four of his former friends over defamatory comments they made following a night out in Las Vegas. Nicholas Polias successfully won the landmark case after comments labelling him a thief were published on Facebook after a misunderstanding about the location of $2000 cash. Mr Polias took Tobin Ryall, Andy Hun Wei Lee, Sandy Jan and Rhys Gould to court for defamation, and has warned others to 'be very careful about what you write on social media.' Nicholas Polias successfully won the landmark case after comments labelling him a thief were published on Facebook after a misunderstanding about the location of $2000 cash . In 2012 Mr Polias travelled to the poker hotspot with friends to participate in a tournament, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The misunderstanding occurred in the room Mr Polias was sharing with one of the defendants, Tobin 'Toby' Ryall, where the sum was misplaced, and later found to be hidden inside a soft toy in the room. Later at The Star casino in Sydney, Mr Polias was involved in a high-stakes game in which he mistakenly short-changed the winner, before immediately rectifying the error. Mr Polias became concerned that his name was being slandered when Mr Ryall published a post implying Mr Polias was a thief. Mr Lee republished Mr Ryall's defamatory Facebook statement, and both refused to take down the posts despite Mr Polias addressing both misunderstandings in the moment. Mr Polias took Tobin Ryall, Andy Hun Wei Lee, Sandy Jan and Rhys Gould to court for defamation, and has warned others to 'be very careful about what you write on social media.' Mr Polias was involved in a high-stakes game in which he mistakenly short-changed the winner, before immediately rectifying the error. On Friday morning Justice Stephen Rotham awarded Mr Polias damages, instructing Mr Ryall to pay $125,000 and Mr Lee to pay $130,000, for what Justice Rotham called 'vicious and malicious' conduct. Justice Rotham said that the charge of aggravated damages fit the conduct of those accused as all four had failed to apologise or remove the post from social media. Mr Polias said 'I'm just elated that my reputation has been restored; it's never really been about the money; it's just been about clearing my reputation,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 'People should be very careful about what they write on social media because it spreads like wildfire and it can be really damaging to someone because it stays on Facebook for a long time,' he said. Mr Polias described his ordeal as 'a battle I will never forget', in a post on his Facebook. 'I would not wish what I have been through on my worst enemy. The judgement was true vindication and I was awarded $340,000 plus interest,' Mr Polias wrote. 'I hope this sets a precedent to those wishing to harm an individual's reputation through the tool of social media. Bullies should mind their words and be very careful who they pick to bully. In this case they surely picked the wrong person.' Justice Rotham said that the charge of aggravated damages fit the conduct of those accused as all four had failed to apologise or remove the post from social media . Mr Lee republished Mr Ryall's defamatory Facebook statement, and both refused to take down the posts despite Mr Polias addressing both misunderstandings in the moment . Two of Mr Polias' other former friends, Ms Jan and Mr Gould, were ordered to pay $50,000 and $35,000 respectively, for spreading the 'malicious' accusations around the tight-knit poker community. Justice Stephen Rothman said although the post reached only a small number of readers, its significance was great. 'In some respects, the confined nature of the readership made the hurt and distress (and the need for vindication) even greater than would be case if it were a publication at large and not to persons who knew and dealt with (Mr Polias) on a regular basis,' Justice Rothman said. 'I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered significant damage to his reputation and felt significantly distressed.' He also ordered that the post, which remains on Facebook, be removed.","Nicholas Polias won $340,000 to be paid in damages after successfully taking four former friends to court for defamation .

"New York City officials tonight issued a desperate appeal for calm after revealing that a Harlem resident has been diagnosed with Ebola. Infected doctor Craig Spencer, 33, rode three subways, went for a jog, ate out, went bowling, and rode in an Uber cab the day before he tested positive for the deadly virus. However, Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the city tonight to insist that the probability of any subway users becoming infected is 'close to nil'. 'Stay calm': Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo told the city there is no need to fear Ebola . He revealed the CDC has been working with the city's health workers for weeks for fear of an outbreak, and a back-up strike team is now on its way to treat Dr Spencer. 'We want to state at the outset that New Yorkers have no reason to be alarmed,' de Blasio said. 'New Yorkers who have not been exposed are not at all at risk.' The mayor said that being near someone in places like a subway car does not put someone at risk because 'Ebola is an extremely difficult disease to get.' 'Every hospital in the city is prepared in the event other patients come forward,' said de Blasio, praising Bellevue as 'the world's finest'. Governor Cuomo admitted the case did not come as a surprise as numerous U.S. health workers based in west Africa have traveled through JFK on their way back home. '[We were] hoping that it didn't happen but also realistic,' Cuomo said. 'We can't say this is unexpected.' Governor Cuomo revealed that four people were considered potentially exposed to Dr. Spencer 'during the relevant period.' 'We're already in contact with the four people,' the governor said. President Barack Obama is offering federal support to New York as it responds to its first Ebola case. Obama spoke Thursday night to  de Blasio and Cuomo. The White House says some officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were already on the ground, with another team expected to have arrived late Thursday. Obama is asking Cuomo and de Blasio to stay in close touch with Ron Klain, Obama's 'Ebola czar,' and public health officials in Washington. He's pledging more help if needed to ensure proper care for the patient and safety for health workers and the public. Spencer, who is originally from Michigan, spent a month in Guinea treating Ebola patients with Doctors Without Borders from September 16 to October 16. No surprise: Gov Cuomo admitted it was no surprise as many doctors commute through JFK from Africa . Flying out, he wrote on Facebook: 'Off to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders,' he wrote. 'Please support organizations that are sending support or personnel to West Africa, and help combat one of the worst public health and humanitarian disasters in recent history.' He was screened when he returned to JFK Airport on October 17 and, according to the city's health commissioner Mary Bassett, he kept taking his temperature twice every day. According to a rough timeline provided by city officials, Spencer felt fatigue Wednesday and when he felt worse Thursday he and his fiancee made a joint call to authorities to detail his symptoms and his travels. EMTs in full Ebola gear arrived and took him to Bellevue in an ambulance surrounded by police squad cars. Addressing a press conference today, Bassett and de Blasio ensured New Yorkers that Spencer did not show any notable symptoms of the disease until Thursday morning when he contacted the health department. 'He did not show any symptoms aside from fatigue until he reported his fever on Thursday morning,' Bassett told reporters. But she was quick to explain: 'Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, the fever was a definite symptom of Ebola.' She said the CDC had been working with Bellevue - where Dr Spencer is being treated - for days before he was admitted for testing on Thursday morning. Dr Thomas Frieden, president of the CDC, told the panel: 'Our concern now is with healthcare workers who are caring for him. 'By coincidence, we already have a team on the ground at Bellevue that has been reviewing the preparations and observing the hospital working. 'We have another team on the way now. 'I also wish to reiterate the case of Mr Duncan in Dallas. Even his household contacts who were with him for several days after he got sick did not get the disease. It is a scary disease but it does not spread easily.' Doctors Without Borders, an international humanitarian organization, said per the guidelines it provides its staff members on their return from Ebola assignments, 'the individual engaged in regular health monitoring and reported this development immediately.' Prepared? This is a press shot of Bellevue staff being trained to tackle Ebola three weeks ago . Fears: Residents in Harlem where Dr Spencer lives (pictured) are petrified they could catch the deadly virus . Travelers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone must report in with health officials daily and take their temperature twice a day, as Spencer did. Spencer works at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. He had not seen any patients or been to the hospital since his return, the hospital said in a statement, calling him a 'dedicated humanitarian' who 'went to an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population.' Four American aid workers, including three doctors, were infected with Ebola while working in Africa and were transferred to the U.S. for treatment in recent months. All recovered. Health care workers are vulnerable because of close contact with patients when they are their sickest and most contagious. In West Africa this year, more than 440 health workers have contracted Ebola and about half have died.","Mayor de Blasio insists it is 'extremely difficult' to catch Ebola on subway .

"First CNN, now Current TV. Former New York state governor Eliot Spitzer is on his way out the door from another television gig - this time due to changes at the top as Middle Eastern media giant Al Jazeera finalizes its deal to buy Al Gore’s Current TV channel for $500 million. Spitzer 'has chosen to step back from hosting,' and will no longer appear on his show ‘Viewpoint,’ a Current spokeswoman said on Sunday. The disgraced politician turned liberal television host confirmed the news, noting that his professional relationship was with the station’s co-founders and not Al Jazeera, which is owned by the country Qatar. Out the door again: Former New York state governor Eliot Spitzer is leaving his gig as the host of 'Viewpoint' as Al Jazeera gets ready to buy Al Gore's Current TV channel for $500 million . Current TV’s mission will be different going forward, he said, emphasizing that the channel’s new owners will focus more on international newscasts rather than liberal analysis of the news. ‘I view Al Jazeera as a very serious journalistic outfit,’ Spitzer, 53, said. ‘They have proven to observers around the world that they are serious and objective.’ His 8pm talk show was the highlight of Current’s fledgling prime-time schedule, according to New York Times TV reporter Brian Stelter. Last winter Current Media’s co-founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt asked Spitzer to take over the channel’s after-dinner slot as its host at that time, Keith Olbermann, was about to be fired. Their offer came right after Time Warner announced its cancellation of Spitzer’s CNN talk show ‘In the Arena’ and put Anderson Cooper in his 8pm spot. New upper management: Spitzer is leaving the show, he said Sunday, noting that his professional relationship was with the station's co-founders and not Al Jazeera . Sudden career changes are all too familiar to the former politician, known for his attacks against Wall Street before he became known for his illegal affair with call girl Ashley Alexandra Dupré. In 2008 Spitzer resigned from his role as New York governor soon after news broke of his liaison with the high-priced prostitute and aspiring pop artist who was 22 at the time. In 2009 Spitzer returned to Washington D.C. as an investor in commercial real estate. That same year he joined the City College of New York as an adjunct instructor of political science. He then got into the media racket making appearances on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher and MSNBC. Spitzer’s Current TV gig was never meant to be a full-time job. His contract with the channel ended after the presidential election in November. Big changes: Al Jazeera says it plans to restructure the company entirely, and launch its own New York-based news channel Al Jazeera America using Current's distribution network . Until further notice ‘Viewpoint’ will be hosted by John Fugelsang, an actor and comedian who has been a frequent commentator and host on Current, the company spokeswoman told MailOnline. Al Jazeera did not return requests for comments about Spitzer’s departure. The Qatar-owned media conglomerate previously said it plans to restructure the company entirely, and launch its own New York-based news channel Al Jazeera America using Current's distribution network. Al Jazeera has said that the progressive talk shows on Current would continue for about three months before changes are put into effect. However, two other Current hosts, the former Michigan governor Michigan Jennifer Granholm and California’s lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom, recently announced plans to leave the company within the next few weeks. Gore and Hyatt founded their liberal media brand as INdTV Holdings in 2002 and re-launched it as Current Media LLC in 2005. The company is presently based in San Francisco, California. Current's origins: Former Vice President Al Gore and co-founder Joel Hyatt started the liberal media brand as INdTV Holdings in 2002 and re-launched it as Current Media LLC in 2005 . Al Jazeera announced that it had purchased the company on Wednesday, January 2. Time Warner Cable, America’s second-largest television operator, dropped Current from its roster after the deal was confirmed, saying the network didn't have enough viewers. As he says goodbye to Current, Spitzer is holding onto his job as a recurring guest on NY1’s political talk show ‘Inside City Hall,’ which he started in July. Washington insiders say he is quietly making a transition back into politics, this time on the national level, according to the New York Post. Temp job: Spitzer's Current TV gig was never meant to be a full-time job. His contract with the channel expired after the presidential election in November .","Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer is leaving his gig at Current TV several days after Al Jazeera finalized its deal to purchase the channel for $500 million .

"The Obama administration gave its full backing to the official film version of the raid to kill Osama bin Laden in apparent attempt to give the President a pre-election boost. Newly released documents and emails show that as far back as June last year the CIA thought 'Zero Dark Thirty' would be a 'winning horse' and gave classified briefings to director Kathryn Bigelow. The film’s screenwriter Mark Boal also was allowed to make 'deep dives' into sensitive information to shape the script as intelligence officials developed a back-slapping and chummy relationship with him. Scroll down to watch trailer . Special access: Officials at the CIA and the Defense Department decided to 'back a winning horse' by giving screenwriter Mark Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow access to classified information . Propaganda: Critics say President Barack Obama was hoping to film would help him capitalize on ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden -- and bolster his reelection chances . The revelation is likely to further anger the Navy SEALs who carried out the raid, some of whom are already furious with Obama for trying to claim too much credit for the assassination of the al-Qaeda leader. In one email a senior CIA official boasted: 'I can’t tell you how excited we all are about the project' -- and apparently vows to keep quiet about free tickets to the premiere. The White House got in on the act as well, making it explicit it wanted to 'have visibility' so it could bask in the glory. Zero Dark Thirty was originally set for release before the election in November, potentially giving President Obama an unfair boost to his popularity. But following an outcry the release date was moved back until after the poll, even though trailers have already been released by Sony. The new documents show discussions taking place before the row erupted and were unearthed after a Freedom of Information request by Judicial Watch, a right wing website. Political: Obama has used the death of bin Laden in his reelection campaign and cited it as a reason he should be given another four years in office . It claims they should have been released months ago but were only made public now after it filed a lawsuit. The haul includes emails between the Pentagon, the CIA, top White House officials along with Bigelow and Boal, who were behind the Oscar winning war drama 'The Hurt Locker.' They make clear that once Obama had decided to support the film, little would stand in the way of making sure it was a success -- and that he wanted part of the action. On June 15 last year, an email from Benjamin Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, mentions that Deputy White House Press Secretary Jaime Smith emphasised that the White House was 'trying to have visibility into the UBL (Usama bin Laden) projects.' Five days later Boal emailed CIA . director of Public Affairs George Little thanking him for 'pulling for . him' at the agency because it made 'all the difference.' Little . responds: 'I can’t tell you how excited we all are (at DOD and CIA) about the project…PS – I want you to know how good I’ve been not . mentioning the premiere tickets. :)' Swift: Bigelow (right) began filming her movie in late February -- less than a year after bin Laden's death . Other CIA colleagues were also on board -- in an email on June 7 last year, CIA spokesperson Marie Harf wrote to a colleague: 'I know we don’t pick favorites but it makes sense to get behind a winning horse… . '...Mark and Kathryn’s movie is going to be the first and the biggest. It’s got the most money behind it, and two Oscar winners on board.' The 'first' referred to the fact that it was going to come out before this year’s election. Another internal CIA memo dated July 14 last year from Harf talks about how Boal has been doing 'deep dives' of information. It reads: 'Kathryn is not interested in doing the deep dives that Mark did; she simply wants to meet the people Mark has been talking to.' Other emails from Pentagon Public Affairs chief Douglas Wilson show that it had given briefings to Bigelow and Boal and that US Defence Secretary Robert Gates 'shared ... admiration for their previous film efforts.' Tommy Vietor, a National Security Council spokesman, dismissed the significance of the documents and said they just showed 'filmmakers trying to do their homework.'","Oscar winners Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal got access to classified information to help make 'Zero Dark Thirty'

"Former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino is unsure whether Lionel Messi will ever hit top form again watching his compatriot struggle to make a impact in consecutive La Liga defeats to Real Madrid and Celta Vigo. Despite scoring seven league goals in 10 games this season, Messi has failed to reach the heights he managed under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola between 2008 and 2012. And Martino, who left Barca at the end of last season after just a year at the club, believes the 27-year-old may no longer be able to play at the level he once did.

Appearances: 11 . Goals: 9 . Assists: 9 . Chances created: 44 . Pass accuracy: 84.5 per cent . Martino told Marca: 'Any comparison with the two-to-three-year period in which he was at his best [is unfair]. It's very difficult to get back to that sort of level after so long. 'I don't know if we'll have the chance to see it happen. It's like when people compare Barcelona now to what they were like under Guardiola.' Messi will look to forget his side's successive defeats in La Liga when Barca take on Ajax in the Champions League at the Amsterdam Arena on Wednesday night.

"Pen pal: Magnotta is writing to letters from 'fans' in his Montreal jail cell . Cannibal killer Luka Magnotta is being sent fan mail to his prison cell where he has been responding to supporters. Magnotta, 31, is being held in the medical wing of the Riviere-des-Prairies Detention Centre in Montreal, Quebec as he awaits trial next September for the brutal murder and dismemberment of student Jun Lin in May 2012. Following the slaying of his lover, Magnotta is accused of having sex with the dismembered corpse before mailing body parts to Canadian political parties. Mail has been flooding in from around the world for the disturbed killer with a special fan site set up to instruct supporters on the correct way to contact him. The former porn actor is reportedly being well-fed and gets time out of his cell which he spends sitting alone in a communal area. He . has been visited by his mother and called by his grandmother, reports revealed. There is . also the piles of mail Magnotta receives from strangers around the . world, according to the Toronto Sun. Magnotta . takes the time to respond to fans, even offering advice to their . problems as he has a 'compassionate side', his friend John McKeller told . the Sun. Brutal death: Magnotta will stand trial next September for the murder of Chinese student Jun Lin who he dismembered and put his body parts in the mail . Delusional: A fan site dedicated to the crazed killer was set up to show 'fans' how to write letters to Magnotta . A blog entitled Luka Magnotta Dedication posted the murderer's prison address and tips on how to get letters passed by tight jail security. 'Fans' are told to use bright cards to catch Magnotta's eye and reminded that he has a particular preference for animal prints. Supporters are also told to avoid talking about his murder case and 'compliment his appearance -  The most important thing to him!' Although fans are told by the site not to expect a reply, Magnotta is still likely to welcome the letters.

Officials in the Canadian province . have said that it is not against the law for inmates to receive mail but . letters they receive are subject to a strict set of regulations. Magnotta's legal team have refused to speak to the media about his case. The trial of a former porn actor is set to begin in September 2014 and is expected to last six to eight weeks.

Magnotta was arrested in June 2012 in Berlin following an international manhunt to track him down. Magnotta faces five charges in connection with the murder and dismemberment of Lin, a 33-year-old Chinese national studying engineering at Concordia University. The case emerged when a package containing a severed foot was found at the headquarters of Canada's Conservative Party last May. That same day, a hand was discovered at a postal facility, in a package addressed to the Liberal Party of Canada. Other body parts were reportedly sent to two schools in Vancouver. Lin's head was found in a Montreal park a month later, around the time of Magnotta’s arrest.","Magnotta, 31, is being held in the medical wing of the Riviere-des-Prairies Detention Centre in Montreal ."
"Ebola is a red hot issue among medical professionals right now, so much so that doctors at one hospitals are using Tabasco sauce in their training of how to treat the deadly virus slowing dripping into U.S. territory. At the Ebola unit at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the staff have been practicing treating fake patients who've been sprayed at random with the spicy pepper sauce, reports ABC. Tabasco sauce is produced out of Louisiana by McIlhenny Co. from red peppers called Capsicum frutescens. When human skin comes into contact with capsaicin, the 'spicy chemical' in the peppers, it will tingle as the brain's pain and temperature receptors are activated at the same time. Bodily hot sauce: Doctors are being trained to treat Ebola by practicing on fake patients sprayed with spicy Tabasco sauce that tingles when it makes contact with human skin . 'In a way, it gives feedback immediately,' Dr Bruce Meyer, an executive vice president at the hospital, tells ABC. The hospital's director of infection prevention, Doramarie Arocha, came up with the idea to replicate Ebola fluids with Tabasco Sauce just recently. Nurse Elizabeth Thomas told ABC that health workers were originally training with ketchup mixed with water. Once workers in training took off their protective gear at the end of the drill, Arocha asked everyone to rub their eyes and touch their lips to determine whether or not they were free of Tabasco sauce which in a more dire circumstance could equal transmission of the deadly virus. 'But we didn't have the burning sensation,' Thomas said. 'So that's how we knew we were doing the right thing.' After Liberian citizen Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, both contracted the deadly virus. It's not evident as to how the nurses caught the illness but they may have been contaminated while removing their protective gear. 'When you have gone into contaminated gloves, masks or other things to remove those without risk of contaminated material touching you and being then on your clothes or face or skin and leading to an infection is critically important and not easy to do right,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a news conference after Pham’s Ebola test came back positive. The test: Once medical workers remove their protective gear after practicing on fake patients sprayed with Tabasco sauce they are asked to rub their eyes and touch their lips to detect for the spicy sensation . Amber Vinson’s family said that her condition has been upgraded from fair to good earlier this week and that hopefully she is on the road to recovery. In the wake of the recent exposures in the medical community in Texas, Governor Rick Perry promised to create two biocontainment units in Texas to treat any new transmissions of the virus. At the moment, The United States houses four facilities with biocontainment units, each of which can treat 11 patients. Texas would be adding two new facilities, and the ability to treat several more patients. Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29 are being treated in isolation units at the National Institutes of Health isolation facility in Bethesda, Maryland, and Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr Craig Spencer, 33, who returned to the U.S. six days ago from Guinea, is the first reported case of Ebola in the most populous city in America. Spencer was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in midtown Manhattan on Thursday and is being cared for in isolation.","At the Ebola unit at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the staff have been treating fake patients sprayed with Tabasco sauce .

"The three pitch invaders who disrupted Tottenham's Europa League match with Partizan Belgrade on Thursday night are serial pranksters whose videos on YouTube and social media have gone viral across the world. Gomes Garcia, Nathan Brown and Dan Jarvis are part of TrollStation, whose previous pranks include turning a Tube carriage into a strip club and faking a kidnapping. All three are still in custody after being arrested following their pitch incursions, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. They added that enquiries are ongoing, with one of the three also arrested for handling stolen goods. YouTube, which recently gave the group an award  for attracting 100,000 subscribers to their channel, are yet to take any action against the group.

Spurs midfielder Mousa Dembele attempts to stop Jarvis, with the trio wearing 'BassBuds' t-shirts . BassBuds posted a statement on social media insisting they had no involvement in Troll Station's prank . The trio ran on to the pitch during the first-half of the Europa League match, attempting to take selfies with the Tottenham players and evading stewards who tried to catch them. Message: Two days ago one of the group's founders tweeted this picture of Nathan Brown holding a YouTube award. The Google-owned company has not taken any action . After the third pitch invasion, referee Yevgen Aranovsky led the players into the tunnel for several minutes on safety grounds. They wore white, long-sleeved T-shirts bearing the logo of audio manufcanturers BassBuds, who sell official branded headphones through Tottenham's merchandise store. BassBuds issued a statement condemning their actions and denying any involvement in the incidents, stating: 'We want to confirm that BassBuds PR did not authorise Troll Station to invade/interrupt the Tottenham game and wear our merchandise for ""Pranks"" of this sort. 'We have worked with Troll Station before and have previously agreed to them giving away our BassBuds FC merchandise including speakers, whistles, earphones, and T-shirts branded with BassBuds FC writing for competitions and in street promotions. 'As you can imagine, we are very disappointed that our product was in any way associated with what they did and we are distressed. 'We would like to confirm we have never been in a contractual agreement with Troll Station. We have terminated our relationship with these irresponsible people, for the unauthorised events of last night (Thursday).' Despite this, Spurs severed links with the company after the stunt and could well take legal action if they are found to have links to it. UEFA confirmed on Friday afternoon that they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Tottenham. The TrollStation video, uploaded to YouTube late on Thursday night, starts with Gomes introducing the prank and his fellow pitch invaders 'Nathan' and 'Jarvis'. He says: 'Today we're going to see who lasts longer on the pitch.' The three pitch invasions are then filmed from the stands, in breach of the ticket terms. Nathan is the first to run on to the pitch, making his way past Jan Vertonghen before stopping to pose for a selfie with a frustrated Kyle Naughton. He then runs past Benjamin Stambouli before  the orange-vested stewards catch him as the crowd egg him on. A tweet by the Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrest of the three pitch invaders - they added that one of the three was also arrested for handling stolen goods . Roberto Soldado did not take kindly to the second pitch invader Garcia, ripping his shirt off in anger . BassBuds, a sponsor linked with Spurs, denied they had anything to do with the incident .

He has his shirt pulled off by Roberto Soldado but continues bare-chested before being dragged to the ground by stewards. Dan Jarvis, the third to run on, sends a steward flying as he climbs over the sponsor boards but is wrestled to the ground by Mousa Dembele. It is at this point the referee leads the players off. In a statement published on their website, Tottenham confirmed: 'Three pitch invaders at tonight's match have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries.

TrollStation were tweeting before the events, saying they were Arsenal fans, and 'planning' their next venture . Mousa Dembele tackles Jarvis to the floor as he sprinted onto the White Hart Lane pitch . A prank last month, which saw them seal off part of a London Underground carriage as a strip dancing club, attracted over 200,000 views on YouTube. Free lap dances were offered to passangers travelling on a Northern Line train through central London with the 'strip club' coming complete with bouncers and a velvet rope. Another prank saw Nathan dancing wildly to techno track 'Sandstorm' by Darude on an Underground platform as unimpressed commuters watched on in bemusement. They also ambushed Russell Brand at one of his recent protests and hid in the changing rooms at a Kent leisure centre so they could ride the flumes after it closed. They also faked kidnappings in a supermarket, a mobile phone shop and a bus stop, complete with 'gangsters' in black balaclavas and hoodies, who bundled the 'victim' into the boot of a car.

"Celebrated architect Cesar Pelli, known for designing some of the world's tallest buildings, has unveiled his latest designs for the 1.5-million-square-foot Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco, California. A new video rendering shows the massive shimmering structure with a 5.4-acre rooftop park, shopping outlets and multiple cyclist and pedestrian passageways lined with greenery. The developers have compared the $4.2 billion project to Grand Central Station in New York City and Victoria Station in London. Scroll down for video . 'Connected': The renderings from architecture firm Pelli Clarke Pelli shows the shimmering transit center filled with busy commuters . State of the art: The glass transit hub will also contain a 5.4-acre rooftop park, shopping outlets and several passageways lined with rich greenery . 'West Coast Grand Central': The developers have compared the $4.2 billion project to Grand Central Station in New York City and Victoria Station in London . Their transit hub will have a few extra amenities, such as the rooftop park designed by Berkeley-based PWP Landscape Architecture, which will be lined with playgrounds and cafes as well as an amphitheater. The above-ground park will be built around three large skylights, which will descend several floors to bring natural light to the underground level of the hub, where BART trains will begin making stops in 2017. The completed hub will replace the current Transbay Terminal at First and Mission streets in San Francisco with a transit center connecting eight Bay Area counties and other parts of California through 11 transit systems, including AC Transit, BART and three city blocks of bus depots. The transit hub will also house a 1,000-foot office tower, which will become the city’s tallest building when construction is completed in 2017. Lots of green: The above-ground park will be lined with playgrounds and cafes as well as an amphitheater . Intricate transit network: The completed hub will connect eight Bay Area counties and other parts of California through 11 transit systems . The transit hub will also house a 1,000-foot office tower, which will become the city’s tallest building when construction is completed in 2017 . Construction on the Transbay project began in August 2010. Since then assessments for risk and vulnerability using federal guidelines have created a few setbacks for the developers, Transbay Joint Powers Authority, and Pelli’s architecture firm, Pelli Clarke Pelli, according to the San Francisco Examiner. A late 2011 assessment found that any glass used on the outside of the structure would have to be significantly strengthened to meet the guidelines, including blast safety in explosions. Authority officials have asked the project’s board of directors to approve studying the use of a perforated metal material instead of glass. If approved, that could end up saving about $17.5 million on material and construction costs, according to the Examiner. As it can be seen now, the design for the new transit center ‘drips with sex appeal, featuring gorgeous architecture with sinuous curves, enriched paving, lush landscaping, and seductive water displays,’ urban designer and writer Darrin Nordahl  wrote when an early set of renderings were shown last year.

"Ayaan Hirsi Al, a vocal critic of Islam and staunch feminist, has today hit back at a Massachusetts university which withdrew its offer of an honorary degree following student protests. Brandeis University announced in a statement yesterday it would not honor the Somali-born activist at next month's graduation ceremony. 'The slur on my reputation is not the . worst aspect of this episode. More deplorable is that an institution set . up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its . own founding principles,' Hirsi Ali wrote in a statement, according to The Boston Globe. 'I can only wish the Class of 2014 the best of luck - and hope that they will go forth to be better advocates for free expression and free thought than their Alma mater.' Scroll down for video . Backflip: Brandeis University in Massachusetts will no longer award Somali feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali (pictured in 2007) an honorary degree after staff and students complained her views were anti-Islamic . Hirsi Ali also distanced herself from the university's claim that she had been consulted in the decision and rejected its offer to participate in on-campus discussions. 'I assumed that Brandeis intended to honor me for my work as a defender of the rights of women against abuses that are often religious in origin,' she wrote. 'For over a decade, I have spoken out against such practices as female genital mutilation, so-called “honor killings” and applications of Sharia Law that justify such forms of domestic abuse as wife beating or child beating. Part of my work has been to question the role of Islam in legitimizing such abhorrent practices.' The university had come under growing criticism in recent days for its decision to honor Hirsi Ali, a member of the Dutch Parliament from 2003 to 2006 who is a vocal critic of Islam. Her comments in a 2007 interview with Reason Magazine were particularly inflammatory. 'Once it's defeated, it can mutate into . something peaceful. It's very difficult to even talk about peace now,' she said of Islam. 'They're not interested in peace. I think that we are at war with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars.' Activist: Somali feminist Ayaad Hirsi Ali (pictured left and right) has been a vocal opponent of some of the most extreme elements of Islam, particularly relating to the treatment of women . Power couple: This is the first time Ayaan Hirsi Ali and historian Niall Ferguson, now married, first met. They were photographed at a Time magazine party in New York in May 2005 . When news of the award circulated, more than 85 of about 350 faculty . members at Brandeis signed a letter asking for Hirsi Ali to be booted . off the list of honorary degree recipients. And an online petition created on Change.org Monday . by students at the school of 5,800 had gathered thousands of signatures . from inside and outside the university as of Tuesday afternoon. 'This . is a real slap in the face to Muslim students,' senior Sarah Fahmy, a . member of the Muslim Student Association who created the petition, said . of the honor before the university withdrew it. Bernard Macy, a 1979 Brandeis . graduate, sent an email this week to Lawrence and several members of the . faculty saying, 'Thank you for recognizing Ayaan Hirsi Ali for . defending Muslim women against Islamist honor violence.' But . Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic . Relations, the nation's largest Muslim advocacy group, said, 'It is . unconscionable that such a prestigious university would honor someone . with such openly hateful views.' The organization sent a letter to Lawrence on Tuesday requesting that it drop its plans to honor Hirsi Ali. 'This . makes Muslim students feel very uneasy,' Joseph Lumbard, chairman of . Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, said in an earlier interview. 'They . feel unwelcome here.' Protest: More than 6,800 people signed an online Change.org petition (pictured) calling for Brandeis University to cancel its plan to award Ayaan Hirsi Ali an honorary degree . Restricted access: Although Brandeis University in Massachusetts (pictured) have withdrawn their plan to award Hirsi Ali an honorary degree, they have invited her to participate in any future academic discussions . Ignored: Hirsi Ali said Brandeis University President Frederick M. Lawrence (pictured) did not discuss the plan to withdraw the honorary degree with her . In a statement on Tuesday, the university announced its decision to withdraw the award. 'She . is a compelling public figure and advocate for women's rights, and we . respect and appreciate her work to protect and defend the rights of . women and girls throughout the world,' the university said in a statement.. 'That said, we cannot overlook certain of her past statements that are inconsistent with Brandeis University's core values.' The statement implied Hirsi Ali and university President Frederick Lawrencediscussed the withdrawal before it was announced. Hirsi Ali was raised in a strict Muslim . family, but after surviving a civil war, genital mutilation, beatings . and an arranged marriage, she renounced the faith in her 30s. In . 2007, Hirsi Ali helped establish the AHA Foundation, which works to . protect and defend the rights of women in the West from oppression . justified by religion and culture, according to its website. The . foundation also strives to protect basic rights and freedoms of women . and girls. This includes control of their own bodies, access to an . education and the ability to work outside the home and control their own . income, the website says. Hirsi Ali, a native of Somalia, has written and spoken extensively of her experience as a Muslim girl in East Africa. She moved to the Netherlands as a young woman, and she was later elected to the Dutch Parliament. She wrote the screenplay for 'Submission', a 2004 film critical of the treatment of Muslim women. Shortly after its release, the director, Theo van Gogh, was murdered on an Amsterdam street by a radical Islamist, who also pinned to the victim’s body a threat to kill Hirsi Ali. Hirsi Ali is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson, who left his wife of sixteen years, former Fleet Street editor Susan Douglas, for the Somali intellectual. He had three children with the former Daily Mail assistant editor. Hirsi Ali and Ferguson are understood to have met at Time magazine’s prestigious 100 Most Influential People In The World party in New York in May 2005.

"A three-year-old Utah boy has been killed after an allegedly drunk driving illegal immigrant rear-ended his family's car while it was stopped at a red light, causing a five-vehicle pile up. Zane Thurber, who was strapped into his car-seat in the back of his dad Matt's Subaru, died instantly in the horrific collision that occurred at a Taylorsville intersection around 8:30 p.m. Saturday. Witnesses said Manuel de Jesus Guinea, 55, was driving at about 70 mph shortly before he slammed into the Thurbers vehicle, and 'smelled like a bar' as he attempted to blend in with the crowd. Onlookers managed to hold him until officers arrived. Because of his immigration status, Zane's family believe Guinea, who is originally from El Salvador, does not have any insurance and fear they will be unable to pay for his funeral and medical costs. Tragic: Three-year-old Utah boy, Zane Thurber, pictured, has been killed after an alleged drunk driver who 'smelled like a bar' rear-ended his family's car while it was stopped at a red light, causing a five-vehicle pile up . Distraught: 'It's a senseless, senseless crime,' said Zane's devastated father Matt Thurber . 'It's a senseless, senseless crime,' the devastated father told The Salt Lake Tribune, where he's employed as a sports clerk. Guinea was arrested at the scene on suspicion of automobile homicide and driving under the influence. Jail booking records also show there is an immigration hold on Guinea, who was being held at the Salt Lake County jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. This means that when local authorities are finished with him, he will be taken into the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which can deport him. Fearing that, as an illegal immigrant, he doesn't have auto insurance, relatives set up a fund at YouCaring.com, where more than $22,000 has already been raised for little Zane's funeral and any medical costs. In addition to Zane's death, the . crash caused Matt Thurber to suffer a concussion, and knocked his . 6-year-old son Holden's tooth out. 'It was just, very, very painful. I . [have been] rear-ended before, but it was nothing like this. It was the . most jolting feeling I've ever had,' Thurber said. Suspect: Witnesses said Manuel de Jesus Guinea, pictured, was driving 70 mph before the crash . Collision: Little Zane, who was strapped into his car-seat in the back of his dad Matt's Subaru, died instantly in the collision, pictured, that occurred at a Taylorsville intersection Saturday night . Scene: Manuel de Jesus Guinea was arrested at the scene, pictured, on suspicion of automobile homicide and driving under the influence . He said the airbags blew and he heard Holden scream for his brother. 'I was hoping that he was just knocked out, unconscious,' Thurber told the Tribune. The dad only learned Zane was dead after arriving at Intermountain Medical Center for his own injuries. Still in shock Monday, Thurber and his wife Aubrie described Zane was an adventurous, outgoing boy who crammed a lot of life into the three years he had. He loved playing Peek-A-Boo, swimming and had 'a real strong connection' with his mom, Thurber said. Unified Police Lt. Justin Hoyal said . it isn't yet known for sure how fast the driver was traveling prior to . crashing into Thurber's vehicle. Investigators are reconstructing the . scene to better determine what happened. Witnesses told police Guinea was weaving in and out of traffic and his break lights weren't visible prior to the crash. Heartbroken: On Monday, Matt Thurber, pictured with his boy, recalled the last time he played with his son on what had been a 'perfect day' Hurt: In addition to Zane's death, the crash caused Matt Thurber, pictured, to suffer a concussion, and knocked his 6-year-old son Holden's tooth out . 'The individual had been driving recklessly west bound on 5400 South, and there were actually citizens in the process of calling 911 to report that reckless driving,' Hoyal said earlier. Authorities are still determining the Guinea's exact blood alcohol level at the time of the crash. In an interview with Deseret News Monday, Thurber recalled the last time he played with his son on what had been a 'perfect day.' 'We bonded so close. I took him to McDonald's and he was in the play pen and I saw him in a spaceship. He was on his last run and he waved goodbye. Then, hours later, he was gone,' the father said. Thurber used the harrowing experience to press the message not to drink and drive. 'If you want to have a few drinks, please stay home, get a designated driver — but this guy was way out of control and it's not fair. It's sad and it's going to affect our family for a very long time,' he told the Deseret News.","Zane Thurber, who was strapped into his car-seat in the back of his dad Matt's Subaru, died instantly in the collision that occurred at a Taylorsville, Utah, intersection Saturday night .

"Men's Fitness writer went from chubby to chiselled in just 12 weeks . Average Joe gained 10kg of muscle and lost 8kg of fat – the equivalent of 16 large packs of butter . If your New Year’s resolutions include losing weight, adding muscle and looking and feeling fitter, happier and healthier then you don’t need to spend hours pounding the pavements or even give up your favourite foods. Joe Warner, the deputy editor of Men’s Fitness, the UK’s best-selling fitness lifestyle magazine, went from flabby, out-of-shape man to a cover model star – complete with rock-hard six-pack – in just 12 weeks, and reveals the secrets to how you can build a brand new physique with only four hours of exercise per week. So what's his secret? Well, hello! Joe shows off the incredible results of his 12-week fat busting regime . 'I spent most of my 20s doing a lot of running but no matter for how far or how long I ran I would always have a bit of a belly and never any muscles on my chest, shoulders or arms,' he says. 'After turning 30 I decided to see whether I could get into the best shape I have ever been in. 'I deal with a lot of fitness models for my job but always thought I would never be able to get a physique like theirs. 'I believed I just didn’t have the right genetics or enough time to make it happen. But it turns out that there is no legitimate reason for not making huge changes to the way you look without a t-shirt on. 'If I can do it, anyone can. I’m an average guy with a busy, deadline-driven desk job so finding the time to train is always difficult, but the regime I followed proves that you don’t need to spend hour after hour exercising to dramatically transform the way you look, even in a relatively short period of time.' Scroll down for video of the transformation . Big improvement: After 12 weeks on Joe's fitness and diet regime, your man could also have abs like David Gandy (left) or the equally hunky cover star of the February issue of Men's Fitness . Step by step: Joe's abs look considerably better after just one week but by week 12, he's in model territory . Monday: 60-minute runTuesday: 45-minute runWednesday: 60-minute gym session Thursday: 60-minute run Friday: RestSaturday: 45-minute run Sunday: Rest . Monday: 60-minute gym sessionTuesday: RestWednesday: 60-minute gym session Thursday: RestFriday: 60-minute gym session Saturday: 60-minute gym session Sunday: Rest . Nick Mitchell, the founder of Ultimate Performance, which has two personal training gyms in London, who designed and oversaw Joe’s training programme says: . ‘When Joe came to me he had a 'skinny fat' physique, which is when you have very little muscle mass on your torso but a large amount of fat stored around the stomach. 'It’s a body shape I’m seeing increasingly among UK men and one that can lead to a lot of long-term health issues, especially diabetes. 'But Joe and I have proved that an effective training regime, which doesn’t require hours of boring exercise, coupled with smart eating can radically reduce body-fat levels while also packing on significant amounts of lean muscle for a better, and ultimately healthier, body.'Nick’s training programme revolved around just one hour-long gym session four times per week, and in 12 weeks Joe shed 8kg of fat – the equivalent to 16 large packets of butter - while building 10kg of lean muscle mass to completely transform his body into one worthy of gracing the cover of Men’s Fitness magazine. Tough: Joe pumps some iron under the watchful eye of Ultimate Performance trainer, Nick Mitchell . Feeling the burn: Joe's fat-busting fitness plan involves plenty of cardio - but only in short bursts . Joe’s four sessions were carried out on Monday, Wednesday and Friday lunch times, and first thing Saturday morning, so it had minimal impact on his work or social life. 'Instead of working through lunch with a sandwich at my desk I got out of the office, trained, worked off some steam them came back to my job more energised and focused,' he says. 'I found my productivity soared once I started training. Even if you have a very busy, very stressful job finding just four hours per week to train will not only have huge benefits to your physique, it will also help you combat stress levels and allow you to work more effectively and efficiently. 'I booked my training sessions into my diary just like I would any other meeting. It sounds silly but it makes them feel more important so you’re less likely to cancel them.''I started seeing major changes after the first week and after a fortnight by body-fat percentage had tumbled from nearly 17 per cent to 12.8 per cent, with nearly all of the fat falling off my stomach,' says Joe. 'I was also adding lean muscle mass to my chest, shoulders and arms, so being wider on my torso but narrower at my waist made me look radically different relatively quicker.' Ultimate Performance trainer Nick Mitchell knows exactly what it takes to shift that festive flab fast . Breakfast: Cappuccino and croissantSnack: Tea and biscuitsLunch: Jacket potato with cheese and coleslawSnack: Fizzy drink and crispsDinner: Pasta with vegetables in tomato sauce . Breakfast: Bacon and scrambled eggsSnack: Handful of mixed nutsLunch: Tuna salad with peppers and olivesSnack: Greek yoghurt Dinner: Steak with sweet potato fries . 'The key to getting rapid results is to work out intensively for a short amount of time, then give your body time to recover fully before training again,' says Nick. 'Training for too long in one go is counter-productive to getting a better body: it places too much stress on your body, which actually eats away at your muscles and encourages the storage of fat. 'It’s also important to frequently change the exercises you do, and how many sets and reps of each you do so that your body is always out of its comfort zone so must keeping burning fat and building muscle so it’s ready for anything.'Joe’s diet revolved around plenty of lean red meat and white meat, fish, fresh vegetables, eggs and slow-release carbs, such as sweet potatoes. 'The diet I followed was simple but effective so I was never hungry,' he says. 'You do need to be organised so that you are never tempted by a quick sandwich and crisps at lunch, but I found that I was actually enjoying my food more on the diet than before, mainly because steak, vegetables and sweet potato mash is far more delicious than a pre-packed sarnie or ready meal. 'And when you are training hard you want to feed your body the right food to keep your muscles growing and your belly shrinking.' Body fat begone: Joe doesn't have an inch to pinch at the end of his intensive 12-week fitness regime . 'I could even have a glass of red wine at the weekends, so never felt as though I was sacrificing anything,' he adds. Success story:  Joe's book, 12 Week Body Plan, is out now . 'At first it was hard to go out and not being able to drink or order anything I wanted off the menu. 'But most restaurants will serve steak, chicken or fish and happily give you as many vegetables as you want. 'It didn’t take long before I stopped craving for sugary foods and snacks because I could see that my training and diet regime were really working.''Joe has proved that training hard and eating healthily is all you need to do to transform your body into one that can grace the cover of a magazine,'Nick adds. 'A smart training plan, executed with 100% effort, really is the best, and most effective, way to build the body you’ve always wanted.' Joe and Nick's book, 12 Week Body Plan, £8.99, has everything you need to know to about how to get the body you’ve always wanted in just three months.

"Ebola hit New York on Thursday but, just the day prior, infected doctor Craig Spencer went bowling at a busy Brooklyn hotspot and Twitter users are demanding to know why. Social media in general lit up with angry rants, confused questions and darkly funny jokes as New Yorkers try to understand one thing: . Why did he go bowling? Scroll down for video . Went bowling: Dr. Craig Spencer went bowling in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn Wednesday and a day later was diagnosed with Ebola . Spencer went bowling at The Gutter in Williamsburg (pictured) while feeling 'fatigued' but before his fever began . Dr Craig Spencer rode the subway along with visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley, The Gutter, and the High Line park. It was revealed today that he had also eaten at The Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village and stopped at Blue Bottle Coffee on the High Line on Tuesday . Health officials Thursday night maintained that Spencer, 33, was not contagious before his fever started on Thursday morning. However, they've identified people who he was around on Wednesday or before as individuals who could be at risk. New Yorkers, concerned America's largest and densest city has been put at risk, are venting online. 'ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHY for a doctor who knows he's been in contact w/Ebola, goes bowling, takes 2 subways, has contact with girl, Uber. none,' tweeted @ericbolling, an example of the many angry responses to Spencer's decision to head to The Gutter in Williamsburg on Wednesday night. Cynical jokes about Ebola appearing in New York City also surfaced. Reactions to Spencer's decision to go bowling Wednesday ranged from anger to confusion to cynical jokes . Health officials say New York is safe, but the fact that Spencer is a doctor and still wasn't cautious enough to wait 21 days before spending time in crowds after dealing directly with Ebola patients has people worried . 'How did you get Ebola?' began a joke from @ianpatrickhines. 'You rented some bowling shoes on Wednesday night and had a scratch on your toe? That's back luck, man.' Ebola can only be transmitted through a sick person's bodily fluids, including sweat, saliva and vomit. Many online posters about Dr Spencer referred to him choosing Williamsburg, a neighborhood frequented by hipsters and other trend-starters, for his night out. Great,' tweeted @senorwinces. 'Now all the hipsters in Williamsburg get to brag about how they got Ebola before everyone else.' Cynical jokes were a popular way Twitter users used to cope with Ebola's appearance in New York . User @lisavikingstad seconded the joke: 'Ebola was in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Seen dragging ppl to a friend's band & wearing thick rimmed glasses though its eyesight is FINE.' Dr Spencer, who had been working with nonprofit organisation Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, returned to the US on October 17. He reported to doctors on Thursday morning as having a 100.3-degree fever and diarrhea. He was quickly taken to an isolation ward at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, a designated Ebola center. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will do a further test to confirm the initial results, has dispatched an Ebola response team to New York, and the city's disease detectives have been tracing Spencer's contacts to identify anyone who may be at risk. The city's health commissioner, Mary Bassett, said Spencer's fiancee and two friends had been quarantined but showed no symptoms. In the days before Spencer fell ill, he went on a 3-mile jog, went to the High Line park, rode the subway and, on Wednesday night, got a taxi to a Brooklyn bowling alley. Bassett said he felt fatigued Wednesday but not feverish until Thursday morning. Route: Dr Craig Spencer made several stops across New York on Wednesday night just hours before his diagnosis .

"Rescued: Jon Hammar, 27, pictured, has opened up for the first time about his horrific ordeal, which saw him spend more than four months in a corrupt prison on the Texas-Mexico border on weapons charges . A U.S. Marine veteran who was thrown into a Mexican prison for carrying an antique shotgun across the border says gangsters threatened to behead him while he was in jail. Jon Hammar, 27, has opened up for the first time about the horrific ordeal, which saw him spend more than four months in a corrupt prison on the Texas-Mexico border on weapons charges. He was released just days before Christmas but says there were times he believed he wouldn't escape with his life. 'They threw every threat in the book . at me,' Hammar told McClatchy Newspapers. 'They'd cut my head off, . they told my family.' The terrifying threat took Hammar, a . sufferer of post traumatic stress disorder, straight back to his tours of . duty as a U.S. Marine in Iraq. He added that the gangsters demanded money in . exchange for his life. The former Marine was arrested on August 13 when . he crossed into Mexico in a motor home heading for Costa Rica on a . surfing trip with a friend. But when Mexican border control . searched their Winnebago and discovered his great-grandfather's . vintage shotgun, he was thrown behind bars. His travel companion was set . free because the gun wasn't his. The Matamoros prison where Hammar was . kept is notorious for being controlled by the criminal gang Los Zetas. Its members regularly use beheadings and mass killings to instill fear . in rivals and protect their drug trafficking and criminal activities, . according to McClatchy. Scroll down for video . Going home: Ex-Marine Jon Hammar, pictured from his Mexican jail cell with shackles on his leg, returned to the U.S. last month . Hammar said not guards but prison inmates controlled the facility and that he quickly learnt they weren't to be messed with. 'There was a tattoo artist in there, . and he said to me, ""You can die in this place for nothing,""' Hammar . said. He added that prisoners were 'full-blown' mobsters, some of whom . were serving triple life sentences. 'I knew not to go around picking . fights with anybody,' he said. Hammar explained that, while in the prison, he never knew when the next meal would come. 'You eat when someone gives you food,' he told McClatchy. But while the prison guards being hardened, he said they were more efficient than the Mexican authorities. 'To me, they were acting more . professional than the officials in Mexico. If I needed a translator, and . the cartel was talking to me, I had three. But when I'd go to court, . they laughed at me when I asked for a translator,' he explained. After suffering for four months in . dirty conditions and on little food, Hammar was finally released on . December 21. But he is only now recovering from a stomach virus and . dehydration he says he contracted while in the Mexican prison. Freed: Ex-Marine Jon Hammer, pictured, left as a Marine, and right as he is now, was freed from a Mexican jail where he was being held since August . After his relieved father collected . him at the Texas border, the pair began the 22-hour drive to Florida to . spend Christmas with his mother. But he fell ill with . a fever in Lafayette, Louisiana, and was hospitalized there and then . again after arriving in South Florida. 'I think it was just an accumulation, just not being in a good environment,' Hammar told McClatchy. Hammar developed post traumatic stress disorder following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet . when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq. After serving a four-year battlefield tour, he . served another four years in the reserves then checked himself into a . nine-month PTSD treatment program in California, which is where he was . immediately before taking the trip to Central America. Hammar said he checked twice with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to see if carrying the gun to Mexico would be a problem. 'I went to two different border . crossings and asked a dozen different people, and at the end of the day, . I got a smile on their face, you know, here’s the paperwork. Enjoy . yourself,' Hammar told the news service. 'At any point, if anyone had told me that [I risked jail in Mexico], I would’ve pawned the gun in a pawnshop in a second.' Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico . Distraught family: Hammar's parents Jon and Olivia Hammar, fought for their son's safe return from Mexico . The 27-year-old thanked Americans, . particularly his fellow Marines, for the outpouring of support he . received while locked in the prison. 'In America, we have people who . care,' he said. 'I'm really grateful. But at the same time I kind of . expected that from Marines. Marines don't just throw each other under . the bus. They look after each other.' Senator Bill Nelson, the state's . Democratic senator, has sought written records from Customs and Border . Protection and has asking for an investigation. Speaking ahead of Hammar's release, . Nelson said: 'No American should be in a Mexican jail for five months . without being able to have his case in front of a judge. We're grateful, . this is a good Christmas present.' Hammar's attorney Eddie Varon Levy flew from Mexico City to Matamoros to pick his client up on December 21. Later that day, the pair flew to Brownsville, Texas. 'I'm very . happy. I feel that the Mexican legal system came out the way it should . have,' Varon Levy said. A defense lawyer said it was . determined there was no intent to commit a crime. Nelson was among a handful of local . elected officials who urged the State Department to help get Hammar out . of Mexico. His family said he was being held in isolation after they . received threats to his safety. Weapon in question: Hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway . Civilian gun ownership is illegal . under Mexican law unless the owner purchases the weapon from a special . shop run by the country's Department of Defense. 'The Department of State warns all . U.S. citizens against taking any type of firearm or ammunition into . Mexico,' according to the website of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. 'Entering Mexico with a firearm, . certain types of knives, or even a single round of ammunition is . illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into Mexico . unintentionally.' Mexican law also bans shotguns with barrels of less than 25 inches. The family said Hammar's shotgun had a barrel of 24 inches. Tourists are allowed to bring guns . for hunting on rare occasions, but Mexican officials said all visitors . must receive a special permit before entering the country. Mexican . customs agents do not issue gun permits. As a result, anyone crossing . the border with a firearm or ammunition without a previously issued . government permit is in instant violation of Mexican law, which . stipulates long jail terms for breaking weapons laws. Hammar said agents told him to fill out a form for his great-grandfather's gun. But when the pair crossed the border . and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and . jailed the men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun. A photograph released of Hammar while he was still being held captive showed him in a solitary cell, . shirtless, barefoot and chained by handcuffs around his right ankle. He . was sitting on an thin mattress with a red blanket in a room with . chipped walls and a squalid floor. The email containing the photo was sent anonymously to Hammar's mother from a Yahoo.mx account.

"A Midwest developer who bought an underground missile silo earlier this year and has been transforming it from a Cold War relic into luxury bunker condominiums just completed his renovations. Developer Larry Hall of north central Kansas says he isn’t worried about the end of the world happening this year. But he is planning ahead for those concerned about a potential regional, national or global crisis on the horizon. 'Luxury Survival Condo': Developer Larry Hall converted a Cold War missile silo into a luxury condo complex for those fearing the next potential crisis . Precaution: Hall says he isn¿t worried about the end of the world happening this year, but he is planning ahead for those concerned about a potential regional, national or global crisis on the horizon . His underground bunker condominium complex, Luxury Survival Condo, was finished just in time for Friday, December 21, a date some predicated the world would end. However, dissipating Doomsday fears have actually caused Hall to turn away some potential buyers, he says. ‘We really are looking for long-term neighbors not people who just want to come in here and buy it and turn around and flip it as soon as one threat passes,’ he tells local NBC affiliate station KSHB. All of the condos on the underground complex’s 14 floors were bought earlier this year, Hall says. The condo spaces went on the market for $2 million a floor or $1 million a half floor, the AFP reported in April. Now each floor costs $3 million, according to KSHB. Catastrophe-proof: Built to withstand an atomic blast, the structure¿s concrete walls are nine feet thick and extend 174 feet underground . Inside: The circular designs provide a luxurious and attractive setting to watch the world end . All the comforts of home: The condos even have ensuite toilets and double sinks . Hall, a former software engineer, says he sold every unit before renovation on the structure was even finished. The application process for each buyer so far involved a strict background check, even if that tenant was able to pay the full cost up front. The catastrophe-proof building was designed as an ‘underground society’ equipped with a doctor's office, bowling alley, movie thearter, swimming pool, shooting range and emergency jail cell. The building also contains intricate life support systems that provide energy supplies from various sources including windmills and generators. Giant underground tanks hold water that is pre-filtered through carbon and sand. Built to withstand an atomic blast, the structure’s concrete walls are nine feet thick and extend 174 feet underground. Full security: Over 100 security cameras monitor a barbed-wire topped fence to give warning of possible intruders . Hi-tech luxury: The residential spaces come complete with large HDTV panels that simulate windows and respond to a tenant's movements . The residential spaces come complete with Jacuzzis, large HDTV panels that simulate windows, walk-in closets in the bedrooms and deluxe appliances. ‘You can use this and be very comfortable in owning it and in the back of your mind knowing there is a hidden use that if you had to use it for survival capabilities you've got one of the best bunkers on the planet,’ says Hall. The crisis-minded developer says he isn’t done renovating missile silos. He purchased two more silos in the Concordia, Kansas area with a similar plan in mind. 'If I had to start from scratch it would probably be economically not feasible,' he says. 'But by starting with a nuclear hardened structure that is the more expensive of the two requirements, I could leverage that towards towards my goal.' Hall began planning his underground condominiums five years ago. ‘When anything is possible, preparation is peace of mind,’ the Luxury Survival Condo website states.

"Serial killer Rodney Alcala, known as the ‘Dating Game Killer' due to his appearance on the famous television game show more than 30 years ago, was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison on Monday for murdering two New York women in the 1970s. Alcala, 69, already on death row in California for raping and mutilating four women and a 12-year-old girl in the Los Angeles area, was extradited to New York in June to face charges in the murders of flight attendant Cornelia Crilley, 23, and Ellen Hover, 23, the daughter of a nightclub owner. Crilley was found strangled in her Manhattan apartment in 1971. Hover's body was found in the woods of Westchester County, north of New York City, in 1977. The Manhattan district attorney's office brought charges against Alcala last year after conducting new interviews with more than 100 witnesses. Convicted California serial killer: Rodney Alcala was sentenced to at least 25 years in jail on Monday for murdering two New York women in the 1970s. Other killings: Alcala, 69, is already on death row in California for killing four women and a 12-year-old girl in the Los Angeles area . ‘I want to thank the family and friends of the two victims for their eloquent statements,’ Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner told the courtroom, which was packed with friends and family of Crilley and Hover. ‘This kind of case is the kind I've never experienced and hope to never again,’ Wittner said before turning away from her microphone and breaking into tears for a few seconds. ‘Sorry,’ the judge said as she gathered herself to continue. ‘I just want to say I hope the family finds some peace and solace.’ Wittner sentenced Alcala to 25 years to life in prison. The serial killer had already been sentenced to lethal injection in California for his 2010 conviction on the five Los Angeles area murders which he committed between 1977 and 1979. Alcala will now be returned to San Quentin, where he is actively appealing his death sentence. For the families and friends of the two murdered Manhattan women, the chance to confront Alcala and watch him being led in and out of court in handcuffs, offered a degree of closure, they said. ‘Mr. Alcala I want you to know that you broke my parents’ hearts and they never really recovered,’ Crilley's sister, Katie Stigall, 63, of Rockland County, said in an emotive victim impact statement. Measure of closure: Tearful family members at the Manhattan Supreme Court in New York on January 7, 2013, said they felt a measure of comfort and closure . Emotional day: Katie Stigell, left, sister of victim Cornelia Crilley and District Attorney Cyrus Vance, right, spoke in the court room after Alcala was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison on Monday . Working as a professional photographer, Alcala, who is said to have an IQ above 160, lured his victims by offering to take their pictures, authorities say. While he has been incarcerated in New York, he has not had library privileges so he has not been able to conduct research and work on his case and he intimated in court on Friday that he is eager to resume work on trying to get himself off death row. Decades of suspicion, an indictment last year and 18 months of legal maneuvering over extraditing him culminated last month when he arrived in New York City on a U.S. Marshals Service plane. The convicted serial killer was placed in police custody. Alcala was indicted in January 2011, after the Manhattan district attorney's cold-case unit re-examined the cases, looked at countless documents that emerged during the California trial and conducted their interviews with the dozens of witnesses. 'It is my hope that this indictment brings a small measure of peace to the families and friends who have spent decades searching for answers, and justice,' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told the New York Post this summer. California authorities had said they were exploring whether Alcala could be tied to cases in New York and other states. They had released more than 100 photos, found in his storage locker, of young women and girls. 'These cases were built one brick at a time, as each new lead brought us closer to where we are today,' District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said when Alcala was indicted, adding that he hoped the indictment 'brings a small measure of peace to the families and friends who have spent decades searching for answers, and justice.' Young victims: Photos of Cornelia Crilley, left, and Ellen Hoover, right, who were murdered by Rodney Alcala in the 1970's were pictured at the Manhattan Supreme Court in New York . Hover, a Manhattan socialite with a degree in biology, was seeking a job as a researcher, a private investigator for her family said at the time. A talented pianist, she was 'enamored of the counterculture of the late 1960s,' her cousin Sheila Weller wrote in a 2010 Marie Claire magazine piece about Hover's death. Weller said last month she was gratified by Alcala's indictment in her cousin's death. Hover's disappearance and Crilley's death made headlines and spurred extensive searches in the early 1970s.TWA offered a $5,000 reward for information about Crilley's killing. Hover's relatives papered walls and kiosks with posters. A note in Hover's calendar for the day she vanished showed she planned to have lunch with a photographer she had recently met, according to the family's private detective and news reports at the time. Her lunch date's name, authorities later said, was an alias that Alcala used. Alcala had been a suspect in Crilley's death for several years. New York Police Department detectives investigating her killing went to California in 2003 with a warrant to interview Alcala and get a dental impression from him. A forensic dentist later found that a bite mark on Crilley's body was consistent with Alcala's impression, a law enforcement official said in December. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Photographer: Alcala, pictured in the late 70s around the age of 35, had . over 100 photos of unidentified young women and girls in his possession . which police are still trying to use to identify more potential victims . Admittance: Alcala seen during his previous murder trail in 2010 pleaded guilty to killing the two young women in New York City in the 1970s . Alcala has been behind bars since his 1979 arrest in one of the California killings -- the murder of Robin Samsoe, 12, of Huntington Beach. Before that arrest, he also served a prison sentence on convictions of giving marijuana to a minor and kidnapping and trying to kill an 8-year-old girl. Alcala had attended college and worked briefly as a typist at The Los Angeles Times, according to a 1979 story in the newspaper. He made his way onto a 1978 episode of 'The Dating Game,' the matchmaking show that was a hit in its era. Introduced as a photographer with an affinity for motorcycling and skydiving, the long-haired, leisure-suited Alcala won the contest. But the woman who chose him over two other contestants ultimately chose not to go on a date with him, saying he was 'too creepy.' Alcala’s conviction last year came after a series of trials, overturned convictions and strange courtroom moments. Acting as his own lawyer, the convicted serial killer offered a rambling defense that included questioning the mother of one of his victims, showing a clip of his appearance on 'The Dating Game' and playing Arlo Guthrie's 1967 song 'Alice's Restaurant.' Alcala fought his extradition to New York, saying he needed to stay in California to attend court hearings and do other preparatory work on his appeal.

"North Korea's December 12 rocket launch shows the reclusive Asian country has likely developed the technology to fire a warhead that could reach the U.S. West Coast from 6,200 miles away, South Korean officials said on Sunday. ‘As a result of analyzing the material of Unha-3 (North Korea's rocket), we judged North Korea had secured a range of more than 10,000 km in case the warhead is 500-600 kg,’ a South Korean Defense Ministry official said during a news briefing.

However, experts believe the North . lacks the ability to make a warhead small enough to mount on a missile . that could threaten the United States. One part of the rocket landed . west of the Korean Peninsula and another part was expected to have . landed east of the Philippines, according to reports. American space expert Jonathan . McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the . three-stage Unha-3 rocket delivered the satellite into orbit and . constituted 'a perfect success for North Korea.' He said that based on his own calculations an object identified by US space command was from the North Korean satellite. When North Korea announced its plans . to attempt to launch a long-range rocket earlier this month Washington . said such a move would be a 'highly provocative act'. The . North has said the purpose of its Unha rocket is to put a satellite in . orbit - but Washington regards the explanation as a cover for a test of . technology for missiles that could be used to strike the U.S. A . similar launch in April, which broke apart shortly after lift-off, was . widely condemned, and this latest move is expected to provoke a similar . reaction from the international community. 'It . was a surprise in terms of the timing,' said Bruce Bennett, senior . defense analyst with the RAND think tank. 'They had talked about . postponing for a week. To recover so quickly from technical problems . suggests they have gotten good at putting together a missile.' National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor called it 'another example of North Korea's pattern of irresponsible behavior.' In a statement, Mr Vietor said the US 'remains vigilant in the face of North Korean provocations,' and will work with other nations and the UN Security Council 'to pursue appropriate action' against North Korea. Japan also branded the launch 'completely unacceptable.' Russia expressed 'deep regret' over the rocket launch on Wednesday, saying the reclusive nation had violated a U.N. Security Council resolution limiting its use of ballistic technology. Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the North Korean launch had heightened instability in the region and called on other nations to refrain from further escalating tensions. 'The new rocket launch carried out by North Korea flaunts the opinion of the international community, including calls from the Russian side, and leaves us with deep regret,' it said.

The rocket launch was carried out on the orders of North Korea's Kim Jong Un, who took power after his father Kim Jong Il died on December 17 last year. Ed Royce, incoming Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the launch showed that the new North Korean leader had no intention of giving up his nuclear weapons program. Royce also criticized U.S. policy toward Pyongyang, calling it a 'long-term failure.' 'The Obama administration's approach . continues to be unimaginative and moribund.

Pyongyang . is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs, but is not . yet believed to be capable of building warheads small enough to mount on . a missile that could threaten the United States. North Korea has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage, long-range rocket. Experts say ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology. This is the fifth attempt at a long-range launch since 1998, when Pyongyang sent a rocket hurtling over Japan. Previous launches of three-stage rockets ended in failure. Leader: It is the second rocket launch from North Korea since Kim Jong Un took power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il . Washington sees North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as a threat to world security and to its Asian allies, Japan and South Korea. North Korea under its new leader has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy. The UN Security Council has imposed two rounds of sanctions on North Korea following its nuclear tests, and a 2009 resolution orders the North not to conduct any launch using ballistic missile technology. The council condemned the failed North Korean launch in April and ordered seizure of assets of three North Korean state companies linked to financing, exporting and procuring weapons and missile technology. Under Security Council resolutions, nations are also barred from buying or selling weapons with North Korea, a key source of revenue for its authoritarian government. North Korea said it chose a safe flight path so debris would not endanger neighboring countries. But there are still concerns over falling debris, and Japan's defense minister issued an order to missile units to prepare to intercept the rocket if it or its fragments threatened to hit the country. Government spokesman Osamu Fujimura said that no debris hit Japanese territory. The government was still confirming if there was any damage on Japanese territory from the launch, he said. 'We had strongly urged North Korea to refrain from the launch, but they went ahead nonetheless. 'This is completely unacceptable,' he said.

"Announcements: Sir Michael Wilshaw denied the schools . watchdog was full of 'Lefty, hippy types' but said those who backed . those methods 'wouldn't be working for me for very long' The boss of Ofsted has vowed to get rid of education inspectors who back 'trendy child-centred' teaching methods in light of warnings that such methods damage schoolchildren. Sir Michael Wilshaw denied the schools watchdog was full of 'Lefty, hippy types' but said those who backed those methods 'wouldn't be working for me for very long'. The idealogy was popular in the Sixties and Seventies and saw children left to work along for long periods of time with little help from teachers - although they were championed at the time for allowing youngsters to work independently. He made the comments on Radio 4's Today  programme yesterday as he revealed full routine inspections of the majority of England's schools are to be ditched in a major overhaul of the system. He said: 'I experienced, when I started teaching in the Sixties, that sort of ideology which ruined the lives of generations of children at the time'. Later on he said that inspectors were under instruction to mark down those sort of techniques which he said were 'unstructured' and 'not teacher-led'. Under the new plans, around three fifths (60%) of schools - those rated as 'good' - will get short visits from one inspector every two to three years. Full inspections will only be triggered if there are indications that standards at a school have dropped or risen dramatically, Sir Michael said. The move comes amid growing concerns from headteachers and other groups about the current state of the inspections system and the quality of some inspectors. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) has warned that the current system is expensive, unnecessary and 'not very smart', while a report published by a think tank earlier this week called for the introduction of a new two-stage inspection process. Unveiling Ofsted's proposals at ASCL annual conference in Birmingham, Sir Michael said that schools rated 'good' should get 'light-touch' visits every two to three years by an inspector, or a serving school leader working as an associate inspector. The findings of the visit would be shared with parents. 'At the moment, it can be five years or even more between inspections for a good school,' Sir Michael said. 'This is too long. It's too long for parents. It's too long between inspections to spot decline, and it's too long for improving schools to show that they are outstanding. 'Far better for an inspector to visit . the school for a day than for a full team to descend on the school more . infrequently, and then giving, more likely than not, the same judgment . as the previous inspection.' Even . if inspectors do find problems in a school, a full visit may not be . triggered if the school's leaders are dealing with the issues properly, . Sir Michael said. The . changes will be developed over the next 18 months, he revealed, adding . that the watchdog is also set to conduct a major review of 'outsourced . inspections'. Overhaul: Under the plans, around three fifths . (60%) of schools - those rated as 'good' - will get short visits from . one inspector every two to three years. At the moment in can be five years between inspections . Under the current system, a number of private firms employ inspectors who conduct inspections for Ofsted. But concerns have been raised about this process and Sir Michael said that school inspection is too important for Ofsted to just oversee these arrangements. The fifth of schools that are rated as outstanding are already exempt from routine inspections, and they will face a similar inspection system to good schools in the future, it was suggested. Earlier today ASCL published a new paper calling for the current inspection system to be scrapped in favour of short visits every two to three years by a single experienced inspector. It also called for all inspectors to be serving or recently retired school leaders who work directly for Ofsted. The paper suggests that there should be a standardised schools 'health check', supported by a one-day visit from an inspector. This check would look at whether a school was successful, if it was improving, if there were areas for improvement which the school could deal with, or whether a full inspection was needed to come up with an action plan for improvement. ASCL president Ian Bauckham, said: 'We need to move away from routine, detailed inspection of successful schools. This is expensive and unnecessary and not very smart. We can find out a lot about schools without it. 'These could be replaced with a short school visit by a single inspector every two or three years. When problems are identified, a check of the school's own approach carried out primarily with the school's leadership, should be the first response.' Mr Bauckham, who is also head of Bennett Memorial Diocesan School in Kent, added: 'Only as a last step, and hopefully increasingly rarely, should forensic, 'under the skin' inspection be needed. And when it is, it should be undertaken by a slimmer inspection workforce largely consisting of other appropriately trained school leaders.' The proposals come just days after a major report by right-wing think tank Policy Exchange called for short one-day checks to be made on schools every two years, with detailed 'tailored' inspections for those that are not up to scratch.","Sir Michael Wilshaw revealed 60 per cent of schools - those rated 'good' - will get short visits from one inspector every two to three years .

"A California couple now in their seventies were given a big shock as they were getting their paperwork together in case one of them passed away. The person at their local county records office told them their marriage from 48 years back was never legally recognized because they had no marriage license. Norma and Bob Clark of Redlands, California, had their second marriage this month to make sure all paperwork was properly accounted for. Scroll down for video . Second wedding: Norma and Bob Clark (on the left) were remarried this month after discovering their original marriage in 1964 was never legally recognized. Big oversight: The pastor who married the couple 48 years ago apparently never returned their marriage license to the county record office, where it would have become a marriage certificate . The two first wedded on August 29, 1964, in the company of close friends and family. But the pastor who married the couple apparently never returned their marriage license to the county record office, where it would have become a marriage certificate, according to the Redlands Daily Facts. The couple recently sent $20 to the San Mateo County Hall of Records to retrieve a copy of the certificate, but there was no record of their ceremony from 48 years ago, they said. ‘I couldn't find it, and couldn't find it for a reason, because it wasn't there,’ Mrs Clark later told NBC News. Marriage certificates must be filed within two years of the ceremony, the Clarks soon learned, and they were told they would have to register their wedding in San Bernardino County to make their marriage legal once and for all. So Mr Clark went to over to the San Bernardino County Hall of Records to remedy the situation. ‘I just went in there thinking I could just do it, and she said, “No, no, you have to have witnesses,”’ he said. ‘Well, you know most people at our wedding are dead. If we had waited a couple more years, we would have been in trouble.’ Not there: The couple sent $20 to the San Mateo County Hall of Records to retrieve a copy of the certificate, but there was no record of their August 29, 1964, ceremony . Bureaucratic rules: Marriage certificates must be filed within two years of the ceremony, the Clarks learned, and they were told they would have to register their wedding in San Bernardino County to make their marriage legal . Déjà vu: Mrs Clark's sister, Deanna Silvestri, and her brother, Bill Thrall, rejoined them for their second wedding to serve as witnesses of both ceremonies. Fortunately, the Clarks had their original maid of honor and junior usher -- Mrs Clark's sister, Deanna Silvestri, and her brother, Bill Thrall -- visiting for the holidays. The four of them, along with others, were finally able to make the marriage official. Alexander, the Clarks' son, attended their second marriage. ‘My sister and I, we just kind of joked that we didn't have to throw them a 50th anniversary party anymore,’ he said. Norma and Bob Clark met as students at Santa Fe State. Ms Clark was studying there to receive a degree in arts while Mr Clark was studying to get his master's degree in sociology. The two met while Mr Clark was giving a report, he told the Redlands Daily Facts. He said that Norma immediately caught his eye. ‘I thought she was kind of cute,’ he said. This year alone, 30 other local couples have run into the same problem as the Clarks, according to the San Bernardino Country Hall of Records. The couple say they now have some advice for other married and soon-to-be married couples: . Make sure your marriage license exists.

'They've still got hope but they are distraught and they want their daughter to come home.' Hunt: A police cordon and a pair of floodlights could be seen in a field near Upton . Probe: Police say approximately 50 detectives are searching for Jayden . Police search the countryside near Upton in Oxfordshire for the body of missing Oxford teenager Jayden Parkinson, 17 . But . Mr Murray said the fact Jayden had not used her phone or accessed her . bank account since the disappearance could indicate a worse scenario. 'I'm . afraid the detective in me leads me to conclude that Jayden may well . have been murdered and that's why we have approximately 50 detectives . out there still trying to find Jayden, still trying to find evidence . that might lead to somebody being convicted if she has been murdered,' he said. Senior police . officers today warned members of the public not to organise their own . searches for the missing teenager, as they could jeopardise the police . investigation. Supt Bunt said: 'At this stage it is a critical time in our investigation in to the disappearance of Jayden Parkinson. There are currently a number of search scenes in the Didcot and the surrounding locality. We appreciate the public’s co-operation and understanding while this takes place. 'Due to the nature of the police searches taking place we would request the public refrain from organising their own search activity at this stage to avoid the risk of jeopardising the investigation.

'We continue to appreciate the . public’s help and support and continue to appeal for anyone with any . information to contact us on 101.'

"The U.S. Federal Investigation Bureau released records it was keeping on celebrated journalist and late ‘60 Minutes’ correspondent Mike Wallace, who died on April 7, 2012, at the age of 93. The files include a look into whether Wallace was involved in communist activities as well as an investigation of a threatening letter sent to him by an emotionally disturbed World War II veteran titled 'Communist Control of the Press.' Wallace, late '60 Minutes' creator Don Hewitt and three others took a trip to Cuba in the summer of 1970  to document the country, according to the files. Not overlooked: The FBI revealed that it had kept records on late '60 Minutes' correspondent Mike Wallace, center, and looked into a trip he took to Cuba . Close examination: The files include an investigation of a threatening letter sent to the correspondent by an emotionally disturbed World War II veteran titled 'Communist Control of the Press' The group departed from Mexico with 22 pieces of luggage weighing about 770 pounds and returned with 26 pieces of luggage weighing about 904 pounds. An educated guess would be Cuban cigars, other souvenirs or additional camera tape from the embargoed island. Wallace, who was 52 at the time, was not discovered to be a communist member or sympathizer. A separate investigation into a bizarre and threatening letter from April 4, 1977, identified the sender as Donald P. Hale -- a disabled World War II veteran and a former prisoner of war. 'I have solid proof that you are a pro-communist anti-American traitor,' the letter reads. 'We will expose you, convict you, and hang you.' Hale’s letter also includes references to his dog puking on the rug and 'piddling' in Wallace's eye through the television screen. The U.S. Attorney's office decided against prosecuting Hale for extortion, stating that his letter did not appear to have criminal intent and that Hale told investigators he meant no harm and was suffering from 'emotional problems.' Long media history: '60 Minutes' began its 17th season in September 1984 when Diane Sawyer joined reporters Mike Wallace, center, Morley Safer, second left, Harry Reasoner, right, and Ed Bradley, left . Show veteran: Wallace was one of the original correspondents for the news program, which first aired in 1968. (left to right: Morely Safer, Steve Kroft, Mike Wallace, Lesley Stahl, Ed Bradley and Andy Rooney) Wallace was known for his aggressive reporting style during television interviews, including interviews with other news personalities. During his more than 60-year career in media he worked as a journalist, an actor and a game show host. Wallace was one of the original correspondents for CBS' '60 Minutes' news program, which first aired in September 1968. A CBS News spokesman told the network's own reporter that it was not uncommon during the days of the Cold War for the U.S. government to keep tabs on prominent journalists. 'Mike would surely get a laugh about this but he wouldn't be surprised: a journalist doing his job back then could certainly catch the attention of the FBI,' said spokesman Kevin Tedesco. The government files on Wallace were pulled from the FBI's records vault and were requested by CBS via the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. The documents can be read in full here.

"A former soldier jailed for life for raping and killing a teenage Iraqi girl and shooting dead her family died in an Arizona prison over the weekend in a suspected suicide. Steven Dale Green was the first American soldier convicted under the 2000 Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act - a law that gives the federal government power to pursue criminal cases against American citizens and soldiers for acts committed in foreign lands. Prison officials said they found the 28-year-old from Midland, Texas, unconscious in his Tucson cell on Saturday and believe his death was a suicide. He is thought to have been found hanged. Suicide: Steven Green is escorted to the courthouse during his 2009 trial. He was convicted of raping and killing an Iraqi girl and then shooting dead her family in 2006. He was found hanged on Saturday . Green was a private in the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennessee state line when he deployed to Iraq. He and three other soldiers went to the home of an Iraqi family in Mahmoudiya, Iraq, near a traffic checkpoint in March 2006. At the home, Green shot and killed three members of the al-Janabi family before becoming the third soldier to rape 14-year-old Abeer Qassim al-Janabi before killing her. He was convicted and sentenced in 2009. Three other soldiers, Jesse Spielman, Paul Cortez and James Barker, are serving lengthy sentences in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for their roles in the attack. Each is eligible for parole in 2015. Attack: Abeer Qassim al-Janabi, Green's victim, whose parents and sister were also murdered in the attack . Neighbour Hussein Mohammed points to the charred and blood-splattered crime scene where the killings took place in Mahmoudiya, Iraq . Green was discharged from the military in May 2006 after being found to have a personality disorder. In multiple interviews from prison, Green frequently expressed regret at taking part in the attack and frustration that he was tried and convicted in the civilian system, which does not afford inmates parole, while the others involved went through the military justice system and have a chance to be released from prison. 'I was made to pay for all the war crimes. I'm the only one here in federal prison,' Green said in an October 2013 interview. 'I think they plan to throw away the key in my situation.' The attack on the al-Janabi family happened at a particularly violent point in the U.S.-led Iraq war. Location: Green was . stationed for several weeks at a traffic checkpoint near Mahmoudiya in . an area known as the 'Triangle of Death'. The four soldiers . went to the al-Janabi home about 20 miles south of Baghdad . Green and his fellow soldiers were stationed for several weeks at a traffic checkpoint near Mahmoudiya in an area known as the 'Triangle of Death' when, after an afternoon of card playing, sex talk and drinking Iraqi whiskey, the four soldiers went to the al-Janabi home about 20 miles south of Baghdad. Green shot and killed the teenager's mother, father and sister, then followed Cortez and Barker in raping the girl before shooting her in the face. Her body was set on fire. Spielman said he didn't know what the other soldiers had planned and merely stood watch near the front of the house. Barker and Cortez pleaded guilty and acknowledged taking part in the rape. Spielman went to trial and was convicted because prosecutors said he knew what was planned. A fourth soldier, Bryan Howard, stayed behind at the checkpoint and later pleaded guilty to being an accessory. He served 27 months in Fort Leavenworth. A federal jury in Paducah spared Green a death sentence in May 2009, but U.S. District Judge Thomas B. Russell ordered Green to serve multiple life sentences. 'I was punished out of proportion to everybody else,' Green said in October. 'I'm not a victim, but I haven't been treated fairly. Not even remotely close. That's all I ever asked for was to be treated the same. They just won't do it. I don't know why.'

"The American woman accused of drugging and bashing her husband to death in Hong Kong eleven years ago says she has no regrets over the murder in her first ever media interview. Nancy Kissel, now 50, has been convicted twice of the 2003 murder of her banker husband Robert who worked for first Merrill Lynch and then Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. In April, a three-judge panel at the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong rejected the mother-of-three’s final bid for an appeal and told her she had exhausted all appeal avenues. Nancy Kissel, the American woman accused of drugging and bashing her husband to death in Hong Kong eleven years ago, says she isn't in touch with her three children based in Seattle . ‘I can’t spend my time explaining the unexplainable. I can’t undo something I never understood,’ she told Bloomberg in an interview carried out via an intercom at her maximum security prison in Hong Kong. Kissel and her three children had moved from New York to Hong Kong in 1998 when her husband took a top banking job that afforded them a luxury lifestyle including a $20,000 a month ocean view apartment. But their outwardly perfect life came crashing down in 2003 she gave her husband a sedative-laced milkshake and bludgeoned him with an eight-pound metal statuette. Police discovered the body, that she'd wrapped up in a carpet, only after his colleague filed a missing persons report. Robert Kissel was bludgeoned him with an eight-pound metal statuette after his wife had given him a sedative-laced milkshake in 2003 . The case, dubbed the ‘Milkshake Murder,’ grabbed world headlines with its lurid tale of the breakdown of a wealthy expatriate marriage in the southern Chinese financial hub. Throughout her prolonged court battles, Kissel’s defense argued she was suffering from clinical depression and was acting under diminished responsibility. During her recent interview, Kissel switches between giving coherent answers, breaking into song and speaking incomprehensibly. The couple’s children – a son and two daughters – were sent to live with Robert’s sister, Jane Clayton, near Seattle, Washington, after their father’s death. Kissel said she has hardly seen them since then. ‘My children are there and they need to heal from something they won’t ever understand,’ she said. When asked why she didn’t take her husband up on his offer for a divorce on the night of his death, Kissel said that pretending to be brave doesn’t always work. ‘You need to find your identity, and I’m still trying. Hiding behind luxury is easy. That way no-one has to ask if everything is alright. And no-one ever did.’","Nancy Kissel, now 50, has been convicted twice of the 2003 murder of her banker husband Robert in Hong Kong .

"Aussie rapper 360 has been inundated with angry messages following his controversial statements about the Australian flag - but stands by his claims that the flag is now 'identified with racism'. The ARIA-award winner rapper, also known as Matt Colwell, took to social media to defend the comments he made on ABC program Q&A on Monday night. He used Facebook and Twitter to respond to his critics on Tuesday, before announcing that in the wake of the online furore, he is stepping away from social media. 'Thanks to everyone who's showing me support. You don't actually know how much just a tweet means. I'm getting off social media for a while.' He denies accusations that he has disrespected Australia's servicemen – but reaffirmed his beliefs that 'the (Australian) flag doesn't represent the same values that it used to.' 'I think those who fought under the flag for this country would be ashamed of the racism under the guise of patriotism in Australia,' Colwell wrote on his Facebook page. Scroll down for video . On Monday night on ABC program Q&A, Matt Colwell made controversial statements about the Australian flag. The rapper explained that he now identifies the flag with racism and said of Australia: 'there are so many racist bigots in this country and they're everywhere' Aussie rapper 360, aka Matt Colwell, stood by his controversial comments on social media on Tuesday, before announcing he will 'get off social media for a while' after being inundated with hateful messages . Colwell asked people to 'settle down and stop getting offended,' explaining he has been 'copping it from all angles' since making his comments. The 28-year-old from Melbourne made his initial comments on Q&A whilst responding to a question about the how Australians are perceived internationally. The rapper answered, 'there are so many racist bigots in this country and they're everywhere.' Colwell explained that he associates the Australian flag with racist behaviour, which is taking place in Australia 'under the guise of patriotism'. 'I identify (the flag) with racism, don't you?' he asked the ABC studio audience. 360's Facebook page has been inundated from people disagreeing with the controversial statements he made about the Australian flag on Monday . He has explained that there is nothing wrong with being proud of your country, but described how the Australian flag is increasingly being used in racist situations under the veil of 'Aussie Pride'. 'On Australia Day you see a bunch of dudes walking around with their tops on… getting on the drink… and they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck,' Colwell explained on Q&A.'I've seen it, yelling ""get out of the country, this isn't your country"". 'I've seen it so much, growing up and still today. It's pathetic.' On Tuesday, Colwell used social media to elaborate on his perspective and respond directly to angry critics. He clarified that his comments were not about all Australians - just the individuals who behave in a racist manner. 'I can see I've offended some of you with my statements…,' he wrote. 'If ur not a racist I was not referring to you (sic).' 'Unfortunately the actions of other have made me see the flag in a negative way,' Colwell posted on Twitter. Colwell took to Facebook to clarify his views, after making his comments on ABC show Q&A on Monday . 'By no means does, it make u racist for being a proud australian, It sucks that someone repping the flag has a negative connotation to me now.' Colwell responded to accusations that his comments were disrespectful to the ex-servicemen who fought in wars under the Australian flag. 'No one fought for the actual flag, they fought to keep our country free and democracy and not for the racist bigoted place it's become,' he argued on Facebook. 'I think those who fought under the flag for this country would be ashamed of the racism under the guise of patriotism in Australia.' ' I would never disrespect the diggers. I appreciate all they did for our country but I feel the flag has been re appropriated and doesn't represent the same values as it used to. He also spoke on triple j drive to 'clear the air'. 'What I'm saying is, it's a shame that now when I do see an Australian flag, if I see someone parading an Australian flag, I'm cautious of that person. 'I automatically think in my head this person could be racist, they might not be as well. I'm not saying everyone is.' Members of the public took to Twitter to criticise Colwell for his comments, arguing that he has been disrespectful to the Australian servicemen . After receiving a torrent of hate on social media, Colwell clarified that he was not saying this behaviour was typical of all Australians. 'People just need to settle down and stop getting offended, I'm not talking about every single Australian in the country...I'm just saying that it's a shame for me that that's how it goes.' Colwell said that he has received both 'support and backlash' since voicing his views. On Facebook, many lashed out, explaining how offended they are by his comments. 'Your comments were highly insulting. My father and forefathers fought under the Australian Flag- they fought for this country yes, but swore allegiance to the flag. I am sick to death of Australians being called racists for being patriotic!' one member of the public wrote. Colwell engaged with his critics, responding to their questions, before announcing he will be 'stepping away' from social media for a while . 'I feel sorry for him... it must feel awful to be embarrassed to live under a flag that so many men died for,' another commented. 'You have a narrow minded perception of what the Australian flag means, it stands for much more than just what the few use it for,' a Facebook user wrote. 'Calling the flag or people who fly it as racists is about as dumb as saying all Muslims are terrorists .. 'There is a minority of racists amongst the flag flyers the rest are patriots.' Others have voiced their support of Colwell's comments about the misuse of the Australian flag. 'Good on you for saying something a lot of proud Aussies think: that our flag and the southern cross are used by ignorant racists to show their 'patriotism'.' 'I'm 100% behind what you said. You weren't saying the flag is racist but there are idiots who use the flag as a racist nationalist symbol,' another person commented. During the program, Colwell explained that he does not want racist fans to attend his concerts. 'In hip-hop there's a lot of racist people … I don't want those people at my shows. I don't want anything to do with them.' 360’s third album Utopia – the follow-up to 2011’s platinum-selling Falling and Flying – has been nominated for an ARIA for Best Urban Album.","Australian rapper '360', aka Matt Colwell, said the Australian flag is now identified with racism, during appearance on ABC's Q&A .

'It's terrible for the community as it's a much-loved area for families and dog walkers, it's our little bit of countryside in the middle of the village and we feel very lucky to have it, so we're hoping something can be done as soon as possible.' Disappearing: The sink hole which opened up on the south side of the lake sucking away all the water in a matter of minutes . Sucked away: The pond was built in the 1970s and is currently home to a range of fish as well as mallards, swans and moorhens . Kate Peacock, who runs the nearby Abney Gardens Community Cafe - and even gave her two children the middle name 'Abney' after the park - said: 'It's the heart of the park and we're determined to do whatever it takes to save it. 'We noticed the water had gone down slightly on Monday, then a bit more on Tuesday and by Wednesday we thought 'something's going on here' and started reporting it to all the relevant agencies. 'It's unbelievable that you've got a giant sinkhole in the middle of Cheadle.' The pond was built in the 1970s and is currently home to a range of fish as well as mallards, swans and moorhens. Pond . Online: Worried residents took to Twitter after the water began to drain away. The Environment Agency has said there is no immediate risk to wildlife . Some of the fish are thought to have been drained away and others are left in a small pocket of remaining water in the middle of the pond. The Environment Agency has said there is no immediate risk to wildlife and no pollution to other waterways. A Stockport Council spokesman said the pond is no longer losing water and work to assess the situation is ongoing. He said: 'The water that continues to flow out of the pond is running at a rate similar to that which is flowing in. The advice from the Environment Agency is that the fish are fine where they are. 'The outflow from the pond has been traced and there has been no flooding of surrounding land or property.'","Man-made pond at Abney Hall Park in Stockport, Greater Manchester took just hours to drain away .

"Britain's Ebola screening plans remained in chaos yesterday as airports said they had been given no instructions. After days of Government indecision over whether to screen airline passengers to halt the spread of the deadly virus, Downing Street was yesterday still unable to say when the process would start or where it would find the medics to oversee it. With the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days, it was feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the UK. Scroll down for video . Alert: A paramedic on duty at Heathrow Airport, as it was announced that it will screen travellers from the three West African nations worst affected by Ebola . While the US said it would begin screening with temperature checks today, a Downing Street spokesman would only say that Britain’s programme – consisting mainly of questionnaires – would start ‘as soon as possible in the coming days’. Last night airports, airlines and Eurostar all said they were still waiting for instructions. Gatwick said it knew nothing about the new measures, with an airport spokesman adding: ‘We’ve not had anything at all. We’re still waiting for Public Health England.’ Public Health England, the Government body which had previously said screening would not be effective, is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work. New problems: Further questions have been raised about Government plans to introduce enhanced screening for Ebola at major airports and terminals, after Gatwick, pictured, said it knew nothing about the measures . Labour MP Keith Vaz said the lack of precise information was ‘shambolic’ and critics called the proposed questionnaires ‘a complete waste of time’. David Cameron said the Government was ‘taking all the steps we can’ to keep Britain safe from Ebola but experts said the continued spread of the disease meant it was likely to arrive in this country soon. The UN warned the number of cases is doubling every four weeks, with more than 4,000 people now dead in the worst ever outbreak of the virus. Downing Street said screening will be introduced at Heathrow, Gatwick and the St Pancras Eurostar terminal for passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa – the three nations at the centre of the outbreak. Taking aim: A thermal scanner is used to test the temperature of a passenger at a Moroccan airport yesterday, but British officials will only ask people if they feel unwell in the first instance . They will be given a questionnaire about their potential exposure to Ebola and their health. Those assessed to pose a risk will have their temperature checked to test for a fever. Defence: David Cameron, pictured today, said the Government is 'taking all the steps we can' to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the UK . Any with a high temperature will be isolated while they undergo further tests. But critics said a sufferer could show no symptoms on arrival in Britain but still fall ill days later. Others said travellers would lie on questionnaires to avoid delays. David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the proposed screening was ‘a complete waste of time’. He said: ‘Why would anyone admit they have been in contact with someone when they’re in a hurry to get through immigration control?’ Asked if he believed Ebola would reach Britain, he said: ‘I think it’s bound to happen.’ Passengers arriving at Heathrow from Nigeria said their temperatures were taken in Abuja before they boarded, but there were no checks on arrival in Britain – or any warnings about symptoms or where to seek help if they fell ill. New rules:  Passengers arrive for a Eurostar service at St Pancras but the company has admitted it is still not sure how it will work . Ministers were accused of a chaotic response to the Ebola crisis last night after it emerged new screening measures at UK airports amounted to little more than a questionnaire .

"A high school soccer coach 'aided' in a hazing attack on four young players that saw them sexually assaulted with a pole, an attorney for the alleged victims said. The coach at La Puente High School in California, U.S., who has not been identified, helped to lure the boys - aged between 14 and 15 - into an athletic storage room where they were 'jumped' by four older soccer players and penetrated with a 'javelin-like pole', according to attorney Brian Claypool. While the soccer coach - who has been placed on administrative leave - did not participate in the alleged assault, 'he knew', said Mr Claypool, who is representing three of the alleged victims. La Puente High School: Angry parents of staged a protest at the high school in California on Monday . Mr Claypool said the coach told the young players to go into the storage room at the school in Los Angeles, according to an LA Times report. 'Once inside, four big players pushed them down from behind. My guys fought like crazy,' he said. The attorney said that one of the alleged victims, upon being released from the storage room, claimed to have seen the coach wink at the senior player that attacked him. 'He is at least guilty of aiding in a sexual assault,' Mr Claypool said. Four La Puente students were arrested in connection with the alleged assaults, which are suspected to have been part of a hazing ritual for new players on the school's Warriors varsity soccer team. Sheriff's officials said they are investigating the coach in connection with the victims' allegations at a press conference on Monday. Angry parents staged a protest outside the school yesterday as details of the assault - alleged to have occurred in May - emerged. The mother of one of the alleged victims, a 15-year-old boy, said she learned of the assault after another boy was hospitalised, adding that the incident was 'terrible' for the family. Barbara Nakoaka, superintendent of Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, said the allegations were 'deeply disturbing' to the entire community. 'We do not and will not turn a blind eye to reports of harassment or hazing,' she said. Officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said all the case was being reviewed by the district attorney's office. The alleged attack at La Puente is the latest in a string of reports of dangerous and often violent hazing rituals at schools and colleges in the U.S. In November last year 26-year-old drum major Robert Champion died after being beaten by fellow members of Florida A&M University's famed Marching 100 band. Earlier this month eleven members of the women's volleyball team at SUNY Geneseo in New York were suspended after a freshman player was rushed to hospital with severe alcohol poisoning following a hazing ritual. Police said the suspended players were all facing charges after forcing eight younger girls to drink shots of vodka while blindfolded and handcuffed.","Four teenage boys alleged to have been sexually assaulted with a 'javelin-like pole' by senior players .

Dan Thomson, 56, and Gary Kerr, 31, staged the fake murder as a joke when Google’s camera car passed by their garage on Giles Street. Mr Thomson, the garage boss who posed as a murder victim, said: 'I recognised the Google car coming into the street from the camera tower on the top. We just thought we had to do something.

The pair say they are fully prepared to create a top secret 'tableau' when the Google Street car next makes its way past - although when it made a surprise visit the other day they completely missed it. Mr Thomson said: 'Last Wednesday or Thursday by chance the car went past. We weren’t ready.' Launched in 2007, Google Street View provides panoramic views of streets and roads after being captured by Google’s car mounted cameras. Anyone caught on camera has their faces blurred due to privacy concerns. Pranksters from all over the world have managed to get their own staged scenes onto the database, while others have been caught unsuspectingly by the Google car. Famous images captured include a man picking his nose while driving his car and a pair of snorkellers wandering down a street. The website has even caught a marriage proposal on camera. A police spokeswoman said officers treated all reports of suspected crime seriously. She said: 'Anyone with any concerns, or who would like to report a crime, should contact police on 101.'

"The family of a pregnant Hawaiian woman has accused her landlord of keeping her possessions. Carly - also known as . Charli - Scott was reported missing on February 9 by her mother having last been seen at her sister's home in Haiku on the island of Maui at 8pm . the night before. Now Miss Scott's mother, Kimberlyn, has alleged that her landlord took her daughter's belongings within hours of her vanishing. Scroll down for videos . No trace: Charli Scott, who is pregnant, was last seen on Sunday night . ‘Buzzards pick carrion and he knows she's not here to defend herself,’ she said. ‘He . removed baby toys that her sister got her. The only reason . I can assume he wanted them is because he thought they were valuable, . they're handmade. Honestly, those were the items that upset me the most, . the baby things.' Miss Scott, who is five months pregnant, left her sister's house to help her ex-boyfriend Steve Capobianco whose car had broken down on Hana Highway, near the eastern shore of the island. Her . abandoned and torched vehicle was found in a dirt track a few days later, . along with some of her belongings, but there's still no trace of her. Officers have so far interviewed people who last had contact with the 27-year-old including her ex-boyfriend who apparently failed a lie detector test - but so far they have no suspects. Speaking at a press conference, Capt. Jakubczak said the investigation continues to be classified as a missing person's case. He said: 'We . encourage the community, the public, to call with any information they . have no matter how minute or how small they believe it is because we'll . follow up on every lead or tip.' Last . Wednesday, Miss Scott's SUV was found torched and was found abandoned on a dirt track. Jakubczak said a private . search party found clothing and other items the following day that . Scott's family identified as belonging to her. Police have the items and . were processing them, he said. Maui . police were also looking for another missing woman, Moreira Monsalve, . who was last seen in January. Jakubczak said there's no evidence the . cases are connected, though they are similar.

Mystery: Miss Scott's burned out car was found in a remote area near the home of her ex-boyfriend . A team of 50 to 70 volunteers and family members have been searching for Scott since her mother reported her missing. In an exclusive interview with Hawaii News Now last week Capobianco said: 'She picked me up from my house at 8:30pm, drove out to my truck that I got stuck in Keanae and she dropped me off at my truck -- it took me about 10 minutes to fix my truck, 'cause I had extra light tools with me at that time,' 'And then we came back to Haiku. And I'm pretty sure I saw her lights in my rear-view the entire time.' Capobianco says he went home and went to bed and didn't check to see whether Scott until the following morning. The following day Capobianco says he was awoken about 5:30am. by police knocking on his door. They told him Miss Scott's family had reported her missing and had given them his name. Capobianco admits he didn't have the greatest relationship with the family of his unborn baby's mother. Capobianco says he went to the police station and was interrogated by detectives investigating Miss Scott's disappearance. He also says he was given a lie detector test. 'The police told me I failed,' Capobianco said. 'They didn't make me take it again. I'm honestly not convinced I failed, I think they might have just said that as a tactic, but I really don't know - I'm walking around right now without handcuffs on.' But Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa urged the public to allow investigators to do their job. 'Even . though there's an urgency to try and solve these cases, one has to be . very, very patient, those in our community have to be patient, to allow . that process to evolve,' he said. 'Otherwise, we'll jeopardise the . potential of being able to use whatever evidence is being found.' Miss Scott's . mother, Kimberlyn Scott, told the Maui News that . the family would be 'taking a breather' and wouldn't be actively . searching Tuesday. The team . has been conducting daily searches from Haiku to Hana, by foot, on . motorcycles and on all-terrain vehicles.

"No, one of boxing’s greatest did not have his bollocks removed. ‘I have no intention of becoming a woman’ Mike Tyson is reported as saying after a false report of him having a sex-change operation went viral. The former undisputed heavyweight world champion issued a statement denying the false claims on the African news site, SpyGhana, which originally reported the false claim. Not true: 'I have no intention of becoming a woman' Mike Tyson is reported as saying after a false report of his having a sex change operation went viral . ‘I am still a man and I have always been fully in touch with my masculinity and have no intention of becoming a woman’ Tyson, 46, has since been quoted as saying. 'The claims are not only untrue but unbelievably stupid. I was at the Pacquiao-Marquez fight on Saturday and any reasonable person could tell I was looking like a man.’ The NewsBiscuit story, ‘Mike Tyson sex change operation a “complete success”, say surgeons,’ was published in late November and spread like wildfire after The Standard in Zimbabwe and SpyGhana both reported the news as fact. Investigative news site Zambia Watchdog is also believed to have published the story, but the story was allegedly removed from the site after the truth came out, according to the Daily Mirror. A leftover link now leads to an inactive webpage. One of the quotes attributed to Tyson in the false sex-change story reads: ‘Some people might think it strange that I’m now a woman. But even at the height of my career, when pound for pound I was regarded as the best fighter in the world, I never lost touch with my feminine side and knew that one day I would grow breasts and have a vagina.’ Just a joke: The original spoof story claims Tyson wanted to replace his long-standing nickname of ¿Iron Mike¿ with 'Iron Maiden' following a 16-hour sex-change operation .

The original spoof story claims Tyson wanted to replace his long-standing nickname of ‘Iron Mike’ with ‘Iron Maiden’ and changed his name from Mike to Michelle following a 16-hour sex-change operation.

"The first photo of Marine Veteran Jon Hammar, held captive in one of Mexico’s most infamous prisons for four months, has been released to the public. The photo shows Hammar, 27, in a solitary cell inside Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas, shirtless, barefoot and chained by handcuffs around his right ankle. He was photographed sitting on an thin mattress with a red blanket in a room with chipped walls and a squalid floor. He does not appear to have any visible injuries. Scroll down for video . Going home: Ex-Marine Jon Hammar, pictured from his Mexican jail cell with shackles on his leg, returned to the U.S. last month . The email containing the photo was sent anonymously to Hammar's mother from a Yahoo.mx account. ‘His eyes look a little lost,’ his . mother, Olivia Hammar, told Fox News Latino. ‘It doesn't look like him. I . feel like my blood pressure is through the roof.’ An summer surfing trip turned into a nightmare for Hammar, who was arrested and thrown into the northeastern Mexico prison where he was subjected to death threats. Trapped: Marine Jon Hammer has been stuck in a Mexican jail since August, when he was detained on a weapons charge . Now, four months after his arrest, his family in South Florida is still fighting to get him back. Hammar and a friend were on their . way to Costa Rica in August and planned to drive across the Mexican . border near Matamoros in a Winnebago filled with surfboards and camping . gear. Hammar asked U.S. border agents . what to do with an unloaded shotgun, which his family said belonged to . his great-grandfather. 'They examined it, they weighed it, they said you have to fill out this form,' his father, also named Jon, told The Associated Press in a phone interview on Tuesday, December 11. But when Hammar and his friend crossed the border and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and jailed the two men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short. Hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to him. The Hammar family's attorney Eddie Varon-Levy said Mexican law prohibits civilians from carrying certain types of guns, like sawed-off shotguns, which can be more easily concealed. Mexican law prohibits shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches. Varon-Levy said . Mexican officials measured the barrel on Hammar's shotgun as 24 inches and that it has not been sawed off. Family members said the gun was . purchased at Sears and blamed U.S. officials for telling Hammar he could . bring it across the border in the first place. Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico . Distraught family: Hammar's parents Jon and Olivia Hammar, are now fighting for their son's safe return from Mexico . Varon-Levy also questioned the way Mexican officials measured the gun, because the measurements can differ depending on where they are taken on the barrel. He said dealing with Mexican authorities has also been difficult. He said Hammar was brought to court a few weeks ago, where officials tried to convince him to plead guilty without a lawyer present. Varon-Levy said he didn't show up because he was told there was a continuance. 'I am fuming,' he said. Hammar could face 12 years in prison, but Varon-Levy said that is unlikely. He wants to get the charges downgraded, in hopes that Hammar can plead guilty to a lesser charge of carrying an unregistered weapon, which carries only a fine. Hammar served in Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2007. His mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hammar developed PTSD following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet . when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq. He had just completed . treatment at a center for veterans in California last year, . before getting detained during his misadventure in Matamoros. Weapon in question: Hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway . Ricardo Alday, spokesman for the Mexican Embassy, said in a statement: 'Mexican authorities have fully guaranteed his right to Consular assistance; therefore Mr Hammar has been in contact with U.S. Consular officers in Mexico who have regularly visited him. 'The possession of any weapon restricted for the use of the Army in Mexico is a Federal crime, regardless of whether you declare it or not upon entering the country, and must be automatically prosecuted.' Alday said Harmmar has the right to defense counsel and a fair trial 'as any other detainee facing criminal charges. 'In addition, his life and integrity are protected by national and international laws.' In danger: Hammar is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters . Still, Hammar is being held in one of the most dangerous areas in Mexico. Matamoros is the active headquarters of the Gulf Cartel, which has been fighting with its former running drug routes along the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border. A fight among inmates at the prison in October 2011 left 20 dead and 12 injured. When first arrested Hammar was held with the prison's general population, which is filled mostly with members of drug cartels. Now, the 27-year-old marine veteran is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters, according to his father. The two occasionally speak to one another over the phone. 'Sometimes he's got his head on good. We're like just, ""Hang in there. We're doing everything we can,""' said Jon Hammar Senior, a 48-year-old software engineer. 'Other days, it's like, it's not as good,' In August, the family received a frightening middle of the night phone call from the cartel demanding money, Jon Hammar Senior said. '""Lady, this isn't about the police. This is our house. We have your son. We're going to kill him if you don't send us money,""' Jon Hammar Senior said, recounting the phone call. The couple planned to wire the money to an account, but officials at the U.S. consulate intervened and contacted prison officials. His son was moved into a private cell the next day, he said. Peter Velasco, a spokesman for the State Department, said officials have visited Hammar three times, spoken with him by phone and contacted prison officials to stop them from chaining him to the bed. 'The safety and well-being of U.S. citizens is something we take very seriously,' said Velasco. U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday, December 11, asking Mexican authorities to release Hammar. Jailed: Hammar was taken into custody right after crossing the border from Brownsivlle, Texas, and is now being held at a prison in Matamoros . U.S. Rep Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, said: 'This is just an outrageous case.' She was contacted by Hammar's mother Olivia, who asked the Republican congresswoman for help. She added: 'If the parents had not told me about it, and his friends had not gotten involved, I would say that it was just not possible for someone to be in so much trouble for doing the right thing.' Ros-Lehtinen also urged the State Department to work incessantly to reunite Hammar with his family and said she's disappointed the agency has not told her what efforts have been made. The Miami Republican said she plans to contact the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol about Hammar's arrest. 'The Hammar family has suffered a great deal since their son's unjust incarceration in August and the details they have provided to my office are gripping and a clear abuse of Jon's human rights,' she said in a statement.

"All six astronauts were given the day off for Christmas Eve and Christmas . A small group of astronauts living on the jointly-owned International Space Station are ringing in the holidays in zero gravity. Hundreds of miles above the Earth's surface, the six members of the station’s Expedition 34 crew ate a turkey dinner with yams, exchanged gifts and spoke with their families by video on Tuesday. The international crew members, three of whom arrived on December 21, are spending both Christmas and the New Year aboard the spacecraft. Scroll down for video . Christmas in space: NASA astronaut Kevin Ford, commander of the Expedition 34 crew on the International Space Station, wishes the world a Merry Christmas from orbit with a cosmic Christmas tree . Space celebration: NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn does a flip in zero gravity after arriving at the International Space Station on December 21 . NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn, Canadian Space Agency astronaut Chris Hadfield and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko arrived at the station last week, joining NASA astronaut Kevin Ford and Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin. The three additional members filled out the $100 billion space station laboratory to its usual 6-person capacity. All six astronauts were given the day off for Christmas Eve and Christmas. That means that they don't need to work on any of the 110 experiments aboard the station and can take as much time for meals as they want, NASA spokeswoman Nicole Cloutier-Lamasters told SPACE.com. Some of the crew members will still experience homesickness, they said. Marshburn, who has a 10-year-old daughter, said he will miss being with his family as he hovers several hundred miles over them. ‘That'll be tough, thinking about her waking up in the morning, enjoying things,’ Marshburn said during a pre-flight interview with NASA. ‘But the fact is we've got some technology that'll allow me to be able to join in with them and see their faces and they can see me. ‘It'll be a little tough for me, as it would be for anybody, but I think the price is certainly well worth it, to be up there.’ Far away: The six members of the ISS¿s Expedition 34 crew ate a turkey dinner with yams, exchanged gifts and spoke with their families by video on Tuesday as they floated hundreds of miles above the Earth's surface . Romanenko said the prospect of a space Christmas is exciting. ‘I think it will be a big adventure, a big moment in our space life,’ the Russian cosmonaut told NASA before heading into space. ‘And we'll be dressing up, we'll be decorating the station, we'll put up a Christmas tree.’ NASA’s International Space Station is a liveable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit and the ninth space station to be inhabited. The ISS provides a platform for its astronauts to conduct scientific research that cannot be performed from Earth. The fields of research include astrobiology, astronomy, space medicine, life sciences and physical sciences. The ISS program is a joint project among five participating space agencies: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Russian Federal Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The first piece of the space station launched in 1998. Seasonal well-wishers can send the ISS's Expedition 34 crew a holiday card through NASA’s website.

"Volkswagen's controversial Super Bowl ad that some have called racist because of its use of white actors impersonating Jamaicans ran during the end of the second quarter on Sunday despite calls for the company to cancel the spot. The commercial, which was unveiled nearly a week before the big game on Monday, ignited claims of racism with one critic saying 'it’s like blackface with voices.' The 60-second spot features a white man who is apparently so happy about his Volkswagen that he speaks with a Jamaican accent as he tries to cheer up others in his office. But the advert, which cost the German car maker about $8 million to air during Super Bowl XLVII, struck many has being offensive since it suggests that people in the Caribbean are relaxed and don't feel stress. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH COMMERCIAL . The Volkswagen owner, center, is so apparently happy about his car that he feels compelled to speak in a Jamaican accent . 'It's just saying, ''Black people are happy,''' Barbara Lippert, editor-at-large of Mediapost.com, said during an appearance on the Today show earlier in the week. 'Didn't anyone look at this? This is so racist,' she added. Lippert wrongly predicted the car company would pull the ad before the game, which is routinely watched by more than a hundred million viewers and costs companies $4 million for 30-seconds of airtime. During a segment Monday on CNN's Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien, New York Times columnist Charles Blow also blasted the ad. 'I don’t like it all,' he said during the roundtable discussion. 'It’s like blackface with voices. I don’t like that.' The ad begins in a crowded office elevator with one person complaining about Mondays, with another quickly chiming in that they are 'the worst.' 'No worries man, everything will be alright,' the Volkswagen owner tells his colleagues in a thick Island accent. The man is later seen hanging out at the coffee machine and then approaches a co-worker who appears overwhelmed. 'Julia, turn the fround the other way around,' he instructs her. The advice to get happy made by the Volkswagen owner is making others angry and drawing accusations of racism . Later, the man admits to a co-worker that he is from a place as opposite as a tropical island as one can find - Minnesota. He then tells a conference room full of people hearing terrible news about the company that: 'You know what this room needs? A smile. Who wants to come with us?' He then takes his boss and another person along for a ride in his red Beetle. When they get back to the office, an uptight man tells them they are three-minutes late, prompting the other two men in the car to respond in their Jamaican accent 'don't be no cloud on a sunny day' and 'yeah, chill out Winston.' The ad suggests driving one of these makes you feel like you're on a Caribbean vacation all the time . All three men in the car adopted Jamaican accents once they got in the Volkswagen . Tim Mahoney, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Volkswagen of America, said on CNN that the company consulted with 100 Jamaicans and used a dialect coach on-set to ensure that the accents were accurate. 'We obviously did our homework to make sure that we weren’t offensive,' he said. Mahoney added that famed Jamaican performer Jimmy Cliff sings a cover of the Partridge Family's 'C'mon, Get Happy.' But that hasn't satisfied everyone. Christopher John Farley, a Jamaican-born journalist, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the accents reminded him of the controversial character Jar Jar Binks from the Star Wars movies, who used a Caribbean accent and broken English for comedic effect. Jar Jar Binks drew criticism when he appeared on film in 1999's 'The Phantom Menace' for his speaking patterns . 'It’s off-putting to see the Island spirit used as a punchline,' he wrote. 'The Jamaican aesthetic–shaped by such Jamaican-born notables as Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey and the revolutionary Nanny of the Maroons–is founded on positive vibration, not mindless happiness.' The spot also has a few defenders. During the CNN debate, O'Brien, who has developed a long-running series, 'Black in America' that probes issues of race in the country, said she enjoyed the ad. And during the segment on the Today show, host Matt Lauer responded to  Lippert's criticisms by saying, 'I take a completely different view of it, to be honest with you. 'I thought, If you buy this car, it puts you in a happy place. 'And what's happier then the memories we all have of being on beautiful islands on island time. That's the way I took it,' he said. And one commentator, Michelle Stalling, wrote on the car company's YouTube page, where the ad has more than 7 million views, 'Jimmy Cliff and VW. I see positivity and happiness in this Ad. I﻿ love it.' The criticism from others is rare for the car company, which two years ago produced the most talked-about ad for the Super Bowl. This 2011 Volkswagen ad was widely praised for its warmth and humor . The commercial featuring a young boy pretending to be Darth Vader and remotely 'starting' the car was widely praised. 'It ate up the internet, it was the most popular ad ever,' Lippert said of the 2011 commercial. 'This one is clearly a mistake in judgment.'","The 60-second commercial called 'racist' and 'off-putting' by prominent critics .

"It was almost two years ago that Darwin the Japanese macaque was spotted wandering outside an Ikea store in Toronto in a jazzy shearling coat. Now the monkey who sparked a social media frenzy and was dubbed the 'Ikea monkey' is looking for a new home. He is currently living at a primate sanctuary in Ontario, east of Toronto, but they are hoping to relocate to a new property by the spring of 2015 and have launched a fundraising campaign. They hope to raise more than $490,000 for the new home which will also cater for 41 other monkeys. Scroll down for video . Darwin became an internet sensation when he was pictured scuttling round an Ikea store almost two years ago . The monkey escaped from a crate in his owner's car and wandered all the way into the store in Toronto . Animal services seized Darwin and sent him to Story Brook Farm sanctuary where he has lived since - they now want to move to a new property and hope to raise $490,000 . Darwin became an internet sensation when he escaped from a crate in his owner's car in the Ikea parking lot. Pictures of the monkey wearing a tiny beige shearling coat as he wandered all the way into the store quickly went viral. Animal services seized Darwin and sent him to Story Book Farm, prompting its owner, Yasmin Nakhuda, to sue the sanctuary in an effort to get him back. At the trial, the real estate lawyer said: ‘I think when I had my two children I didn't have time to mother them. I was more focused on building my practice. ‘Having Darwin ...was like the chance to experience motherhood again. ‘I treated him like a son. It sounds bizarre to some people, but that’s how we treated him.' An Ontario Superior Court justice said while Darwin may have worn clothing and slept in his former owner's bed, he was a wild animal and that Nakhuda's ownership ended with his escape from her car. Nakhuda decided to appeal the ruling but abandoned her effort, saying it was too costly and had little chance of success. While living with owner Yasmin Nakhuda, Darwin slept and showered with her and was rarely out of her sight . The monkey was baby bottle fed at night time and required at least three diaper changes a day . Animal services seized Darwin and sent him to Story Book Farm, prompting its owner, Yasmin Nakhuda (pictured), to sue the sanctuary in an effort to get him back - she failed in her efforts to do so . Up until the day that he escaped his human mom, Yasmin Kakhuda, Darwin had spent most days dressed in snazzy clothes and a diaper . The founder of Story Brook Farm said Darwin's story put the spotlight on the sale of exotic animals as pets in Canada. The sanctuary says Darwin has now grown into a 'much larger, energetic and rambunctious juvenile.' It says its new home will have wide open spaces and forested enclosures for Darwin and his fellow sanctuary residents. A $10 donation to the fundraising campaign yields a 'virtual kiss' from Darwin in the form of a video and an e-note. A $200 donation pays for a tour of the sanctuary and $500 results in five visits to Darwin in one year. The online campaign was launched on Tuesday and had raised about $3,400 after two days.","The monkey was spotted wandering outside an Ikea store in Toronto .

"Senior leaders at the BBC are still passing the buck. Or in this case, one might say the yuan. BBC Trust Chairman Lord Patten told a group of investigators that he blamed the ‘horrible screw-up’ surrounding the Jimmy Savile sex scandal on the ‘Chinese management style’ of the organization’s former director general Mark Thompson and the ineptitude of his successor George Entwistle, it was revealed Friday. Lord Patten, the Trust’s chairman since May 2011, said the BBC had ‘more senior leaders than China’ under Thompson with 25 to 27 people on his senior management team. 'Chinese-style management': Lord Patten, pictured, said the BBC had 'more senior leaders than China' under New York Time's chief executive Mark Thompson . ‘They never met,’ Lord Patten said, according to recently published transcripts and appendices to The Pollard Report, which was released to the public in December. Lord Patten told the Pollard investigators that the mishandling of the scandal continued after Thompson left due to the mismanaged team working under Entwistle. ‘I don't think the BBC needs more senior people in order to avoid making basic mistakes,’ Lord Patten said. He said Entwistle's lack of knowledge of the Savile sex abuse investigation was ironic given how frequently Entwistle referred to the ‘silo’ culture that had taken form under Thompson during interviews for the top position. Thompson, who became BBC's director general in June 2004, resigned in September and took over as chief executive of the New York Times in November. After his departure he told Andrew Marr, another former BBC employee, that the public broadcasting corporation was ‘getting very, very close to the edge’ after the latest round of cost-cutting. Entwistle resigned from the director general role in November 2012, less than two months after succeeding Thompson. Rapid turnover: Mark Thompson, left, resigned from from the director general role in September. George Entwistle, right, resigned from the director general role in November, less than two months after succeeding Thompson . Lord Patten told the Pollard investigators that the BBC’s acting director general Tim Davie, who took over when Entwistle resigned, has ‘two or three experienced people around him’ and that there is no longer an ‘impression of frantic faffing about’ when he walks into his office. Lord Patten also denied having prior knowledge of a plan to make Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, who decided not to broadcast an investigation into Savile sex abuse allegations in December 2011, ‘the fall guy’ for the crisis that ensued after the scandal made headlines in October. Savile, the former BBC television host who died last year at 84, is believed to have been one of Britain’s most prolific sex offenders after hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse and rape became public following his death. Lord Patten told the investigators some people at the BBC thought Rippon would make ‘a convenient fall guy’ and could be ‘hung out to dry’ but that the BBC Trust ‘never got to that position.’ The BBC Trust chairman said he was misled by senior executives during the organization’s mishandling of the scandal. Prior to joining the BBC, Lord Patten was the last governor of British Hong Kong before its handover to the People's Republic of China in July 1997.

Total U.S. trade amounted to $4.93 trillion in 2012, including imported and exported services, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Friday.

"Coca-Cola, which became one of the world's most iconic brands by marketing its soft drinks as a means to happiness, is now buying up popular television advertising slots to address obesity -- mainly in the U.S. On Monday, the Atlanta, Georgia-based beverage giant began airing a two-minute commercial during the highest-rated shows on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News in hopes of becoming a clearly-heard voice in the growing debate over sodas and other sugary drinks and the health risks they cause. Scroll down to watch the new Coca-Cola commercial: . Thinking thin: Coca-Cola, the world's leading beverage company, is taking to the airwaves for the first time to address a growing cloud over the industry: obesity . New message: Coca-Cola says its new health-conscious ad campaign will kick off a variety of moves that help address obesity in the year ahead, such as providing more diet options at soda fountains . The new television ad touts Coca-Cola's record of selling beverages with fewer calories over the years and notes that weight gain is the result of consuming too many calories of any kind and not just soda. Coca-Cola says its latest marketing campaign will kick off a variety of moves that help address obesity in the upcoming year, such as providing more diet options at soda fountains. For the world's number one beverage company in terms of market share, the new ads reflect  mounting pressures on the industry as a whole. The soft drink industry is ‘an industry that’s under siege’ said Jeff Cronin, communications director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ‘This is a damage control exercise, not a meaningful contribution to addressing the issue of obesity,’ he told MailOnline, ‘The new commercial is not aimed at consumers, but rather policy makers.' Later this year, New York City is set to put into effect a first-in-the-nation cap on the size of soft drinks sold at restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas and other venues, an initiative proposed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Henrietta Davis, the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, proposed a similar measure in June, saying she was inspired by New York's effort. When PepsiCo Inc., the number two soda maker, recently signed a big endorsement deal with pop singer Beyonce, critics called for the singer to drop her contract or at least donate the money she made to groups that fund health initiatives. ‘What consumers need to know is that Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other sugary drinks promote obesity, diabetes and other health problems,’ said Cronin of CSPI. Diana Garza Ciarlante, a spokeswoman for the Coca-Cola Company, told the Associated Press that the new ads were not designed as a reaction to any negative public sentiment. She said that the company felt it needed to address ‘the issue of the times’ and be part of the discussion on obesity. Looking good: The commercial shows young, thin and healthy-looking people as the narrator references Coca-Cola's efforts to help raise awareness about the health risks of drinking soft drinks with high sugar and calorie levels . Intentions: A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said the new ads aren't a reaction to any negative public sentiment but that the company felt it needed to address 'the issue of the times' and be part of the discussion on obesity . ‘We have not done a good enough job in telling our story and being consistent in telling our story,’ she said, noting the company had to be careful in its messaging to remain consistent with its brand voice and avoid sounding ‘preachy.’ In the ad, a narrator notes that obesity is an issue that ‘concerns all of us’ while people can make a difference when they ‘come together.’ The spot was produced by agencies Bright House Media Strategies and Citizen2 and is intended to reflect Coca-Cola's corporate responsibility among cable news viewers. Coke Zero = 0.5 calories, no sugar . Diet Coke = 0.5 calories, no sugar . Caffeine-Free Diet Coke = 0.5 calories, no sugar . Diet Coke with Cherry = 1.5 calories, no sugar . Diet Coke with Citrus Zest = 2 calories, no sugar . Sprite Zero = 2.0 calories, zero sugar . Fanta Zero Icy Lemon = 3 calories, 0.3 sugar . Fanta Zero Orange = 5 calories, 0.8 sugar . Another advertisement, which will run later this week during ‘American Idol’ and before the Super Bowl, is much more reminiscent of the upbeat advertising people have come to expect from Coca-Cola, such as the company's digitally-rendered polar bears. The second ad features a montage of activities that amount to burning off the ‘140 happy calories’ in a can of Coke: dancing, walking a dog, laughing with friends and doing a victory dance after bowling a strike. Ciarlante of Coca-Cola said the 30-second spot, a version of which ran in Brazil last month, is intended to address confusion about the number of calories in soda. She said the company's consumer research showed that people thought there were as many as 900 calories in a can of soda. She declined to offer details on the health-related actions Coca-Cola has planned for the upcoming year. One of the options under consideration is putting the amount of activity needed to burn off the calories in a drink on cans and bottles, she said. Coca-Cola points out in its latest commercial that the company has already begun making efforts to help customers make smarter health choices, such as putting calorie counts on the front of its cans and bottles in the U.S. Last year, the company also started posting calorie information on its vending machines ahead of a regulation that will require soda companies to do so by 2014. Public concern over calorie counts is apparent in Coca-Cola's sales numbers. In North America, all the growth in the company's soda business over the past 15 years has come from low- and no-calorie drinks, such as Coke Zero. Diet sodas now account for nearly a third of its sales in the U.S. and Canada. Other beverages, such as sports drinks and bottled water, are also fueling growth in the market. Even with the growing popularity of diet sodas, however, overall soda consumption in the U.S. has declined steadily since 1998, according to industry tracker Beverage Digest. 'Come together': In the ad, the narrator notes that obesity is an issue that 'concerns all of us¿ but that people can make a difference when they ¿come together' Man in charge: Coca-Cola Company Chairman and Chief Executive Muhtar Kent leads the the world's number one beverage company in terms of market share .","Coca-Cola on Monday began airing a two-minute spot on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC in hopes of becoming a clearly-heard voice in the debate over sodas and public health .

"U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Hispanics ‘the center of the nation's future’ on Thursday as he rallied Latino Congress members to push for immigration reform. He also reminded those in attendance that their political influence will continue to grow in the years ahead. Biden delivered his impassioned speech at a ceremonial event on Capitol Hill hosted by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, a nonpartisan group that works to encourage Latino leadership in politics. A changing cultural landscape: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Hispanics 'the center of the nation's future' on Thursday as he rallied Latino Congress members to push for immigration reform . ‘The way to make the mark is for the Hispanic community to step up and step out and let the world know, let the Republicans know, let others know that if you ignore the needs and concerns of the Hispanic community, you will not win,’ Biden said. He also said that United States citizens recognize what Latinos -- both documented and undocumented – are capable of contributing to the country. ‘It's no longer about what can be done for the Hispanic community,’ he said. ‘The question is what the Hispanic community is going to do to take this country to a totally new place.’ There are now three senators and 33 House members of Latino descent in the 113th Congress; a new record. Rising political population: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute welcomed the Hispanic members of the 113th Congress at a ceremonial swearing-in on Thursday, January 3, 2013, in Washington, D.C. Many of those leaders are strong supporters of immigration reform, which ranks high -- though not first -- on the list of priorities among Latino voters, according to the Huffington Post. While the majority of Hispanics in Congress are Democrats, several of the most prominent figures are GOP members. Biden said on Thursday he was hopeful that Republicans would join the immigration reform effort in the U.S. He said the Republican party had undergone a ‘rapid epiphany’ in the wake of their election defeat in November. Warm welcome: Biden administered the Senate Oath to Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, during a mock swearing in ceremony as the 113th Congress officially began . Meanwhile, President Barack Obama said that he plans to begin taking major steps towards immigration reform this month, now that the ‘fiscal cliff’ conflict has been resolved. Obama said in June that his administration would stop deporting young people who had been brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children. Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security announced new rules this week that will make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States as they seek permanent residency. Prior to that, the majority of undocumented immigrants were forced to return to their home countries to apply for U.S. citizenship.

"A young woman who was sexually assaulted and then spent five days in jail when police turned her from victim into accused won a ‘marathon legal battle’ and received a $1.5 million settlement for her tribulations. The liability insurance carrier for Pennsylvania's Cranberry Township paid the settlement money to Sara Reedy (also identified in court documents as Sara Watt) after several years of legal processing. Her vindication against the police detective who arrested her for theft and falsely reporting a crime has helped change federal law in regards to how rape cases are handled. Payback: Rape victim Sara Reedy sued Pennsylvania's Cranberry Township Police Department for arresting her after she was sexually assaulted and settled out of court for $1.5 million . Reedy was a 19-year-old college student . when a man entered the gas station where she worked, stole $606.73 from . the register, put a gun to her head and demanded oral sex, saying he . would shoot her if she refused. ‘I had images of my family finding me dead,’ she recently told London’s Observer newspaper about the attack that occurred on July 14, 2004. ‘I closed my eyes and just tried to get it over with.’ After sexually assaulting Reedy, her attacker Wilbur Brown, 44, fled the scene and spent more than a year undetected before striking again. In that time Reedy, who is now 27, was held responsible for his theft. Frank Evanson, the Cranberry Pennsylvania police detective who interviewed Reedy in a nearby hospital, didn't believe her when she told him what happened. That was after Reedy allowed hospital workers to conduct a rape kit examination, which was never followed up on. Instead of going after her reported attacker, Evanson accused Reedy of stealing the money herself and creating the story as a cover-up. After further police inquiries, Reedy was arrested for theft and falsely reporting a crime and sent to jail. She was pregnant with her first child at the time, she said. Reedy was subsequently released on bail, but lost her job at the gas station. Evanson continued to accuse her of the theft and falsely reporting a crime, despite another sexual attack in the area three months later ‘that was substantially similar,’ and which Evanson became the lead investigator on. Then, a month before Reedy's trial, her attacker was arrested after he raped another woman in a convenience store close to the Gulf station where Reedy had worked. After his arrest Brown admitted to sexually assaulting Reedy in 2004 and stealing the $606.73. Reedy was in court in 2006 to see him plead guilty to assaulting 10 women in total. Brown is now serving life in prison. When the charges against her were dropped, Reedy sued Evanson and the Cranberry Police Department. That case was initially dismissed in a district court in 2009. Then with help from several non-profit groups and a local attorney, Reedy appealed. In March 2010, the appeal judges ruled that Evanson had not acted reasonably and lacked probable cause when he arrested Reedy. They decided that the case could go to trial. The Cranberry Township finally settled before trial on behalf of Evanson, who is still on the job. Disbeliever: Frank Evanson, the Cranberry Pennsylvania police detective who interviewed Reedy in a nearby hospital after she was assaulted, didn't believe her when she told him what happened . Reedy's $1.5 million payment could only be revealed now she said because of a non-disclosure clause that was part of the settlement. United National Insurance Co., which covers the Cranberry Township, made the payment. The settlement amount 'will close the matter, bypassing the uncertainty of courtroom litigation and the expense of attorney's fees,' according to a joint statement between both sides. Reedy's case has helped persuade the U.S. federal government to change the definition of rape to include forced oral sex and the rape of men. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit implemented new case law providing updated guidance on how police should investigate sexual assault cases. 'That information is part of our constant, comprehensive continuing education program for all Officers,' Cranberry Township's manager Jerry Andree told MailOnline in an email response. 'This was a very difficult issue for everyone and we are sorry this . happened to Ms. Reedy. We are glad the parties could arrive at agreeable . terms that will allow the parties to move on,' A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Police told MailOnline that the state police 'was in no way' involved in the matter. The Cranberry Police Department did not return requests for comments. ‘I'm relieved that people will be able . to see now that I was telling the truth,’ Reedy said during her interview with the Observer. ‘Although mine is an extreme case, I'm not the first – and I won't be . the last.’","Sara Reedy of Pennsylvania was 19 when a man entered the gas station where she .

"Oldham will not offer convicted rapist Ched Evans a return to football, the club confirmed on Monday. The 25-year-old was released from prison in October after serving just half of his sentence for the rape of a teenage girl. The former Sheffield United striker had looked set to re-sign for the Blades but they bowed to intense public pressure not to allow him back. Evans, pictured at his home last week, looks unlikely to join Oldham after talks with the League One club . Evans, pictured in action for Sheffield United in 2012, was jailed for the rape of a teenage girl . League One Oldham had spoken to Evans about joining Lee Johnson’s side but a source said: ‘It is 99.9 per cent not going to happen.' And on Monday, Oldham released a statement confirming no offer would be made to Evans. 'Oldham Athletic are aware of various newspaper reports linking the club to Ched Evans yesterday,' the statement said. 'The Board of Directors would like to confirm that we will not be extending an invitation for Ched Evans to train with Oldham Athletic nor will we be offering him a contract. The club will not be making any further comment on this subject.' Evans had initially been allowed to train with his former side Sheffield United, but after several sponsors and patrons either stepped down or threatened to, the club retracted their offer. Ched Evans was initially allowed to train at his old club Sheffield United, before they retracted their offer . Tranmere chairman Mark Palios also claims to have turned down an approach from Evans' representatives about the possibility of him playing for the struggling League Two side. Palios said he had twice been contacted by people on behalf of Evans but refused to pursue the idea. 2011 - May 30: Ched Evans arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, North Wales.

April 23: The Professional Footballers Association is forced to defend itself after Evans is named in the League One team of the year with chief executive Gordon Taylor stating: 'That was a football judgement by his fellow professionals, it was not a moral judgement and in no way does the PFA condone the offence for which he was convicted.' Evans is released by Sheffield United at the end of the season. April 24: Evans' lawyers announce he is to appeal against his conviction. August 21: The first stage of Evans' appeal is rejected after a judge had refuses his application for leave to appeal against his conviction. November 5: Nine people plead guilty to revealing the identity of Evans' victim online with some of the comments calling her names like 'money grabbing whore' and 'poor little victim'. November 6: Evans loses his appeal after his case is rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London. 2014 - April 18: An online petition is launched urging United not to re-sign Evans and gains over 165,000 signatures.

October 18: United release a statement saying that they are 'continuing to deliberate on any long-term decision' after media reports emerge that they have offered Evans a contract. October 19: The Criminal Cases Review Commission confirm they are to fast-track Evans' case to investigate whether his conviction will be referred to the Court of Appeal. October 22: Evans releases a statement stating his desire to return to football and says: 'Even though I have been released from prison, I am determined to continue the fight to clear my name and it is public knowledge that an application to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal has recently been submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission by my lawyers.' November 11: Sheffield United confirm Evans will return to train with the club with immediate effect following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association but state they are 'not prepared at this time' to make a decision on whether to re-sign the striker. Television presenter Charlie Webster announces that she has stood down as a patron of Sheffield United. November 12: Sheffield Central MP Paul Blomfield urges United to change their decision, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says the club must 'think really long and hard' before deciding whether to allow Evans to play for them again, while singer Dave Berry and businesswoman Lindsay Graham join Webster in resigning as club patrons. November 13: Olympic heptathlon champion and Blades fan Jessica Ennis-Hill issues a statement announcing that she has told United she would want her name removed from the Bramall Lane stand should Evans be offered a contract to play for the club.

"Attacked: Nicolas Sarkozy has been accused of 'sacrilege' towards Allied forces . Nicolas Sarkozy has come in for heavy criticism after approving plans for a large wind farm complex off the D-Day coast where Allied troops launched their World War Two assault in 1944. The French President was accused of a 'grave attack on the collective memory' of Allied forces after giving the go-ahead for the plans on the Calvados coast near the Normandy landing beaches. The proposed project will see more than 100 turbines more than 525ft high erected just seven miles from the beaches, synonymous with the D-Day landings. Mr Sarkozy's decision to open the . bidding process on the €20 billion (£17.5 billion) project has been . branded 'sacrilegious' by critics, including British veterans' families. It . was claimed the windmills' flashing lights would ruin poignant night . remembrances on Juno and Omaha beaches by giving off a 'disco' effect. Juno was the target of 3rd Canadian Infantry Division supported by British Royal Marine Commandos. It is less than 20 miles from the . coastline codenamed Omaha Beach in 1944, where U.S. forces suffered more . than 2,000 casualties during the operation. War zones: The areas of French coast codenamed Omaha and Juno - the U.S. and Canadian landing zones respectively - and the proposed offshore wind farm area . The aim of the project is to create 1,200 windfarms off the French Atlantic seaboard by the year 2020. France remains behind other European countries, included Britain, in the use of sea turbine energy, and plans are in place to narrow the gap and lessen the French reliance on nuclear power. One of the five projects in the first batch of tenders is off Courseulles-sur-Mer, nearest to Juno Beach, on which 2,500 Allied soldiers died on D-Day. Construction is due to begin on the . wind farms in 2015, but Mr Sarkozy faces tough opposition as over 4,000 . people from 50 countries have signed an online petition against the . plan. Historic scene: Omaha Beach secured after D-Day in 1944. More than 2,000 U.S. soldiers died in the landings here . Quiet reflection: A D-Day veteran on Juno Beach on the 60th anniversary of the landings . Gérard Lecornu, . president of the Port Winston Churchill Association of Arromanches, told . the Daily Telegraph: 'They will be visible from all the Normandy . landing beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. 'Three million tourists come from the . world over to the landing beaches. The first thing they do is look at . the line of horizon from where the landings came. 'D-Day is in our collective memory. To touch this is a very grave attack on that memory.' Blight: How the view from the beachhead at Normandy might look if the plan for an offshore wind farm goes ahead . Resistance: British veterans gathering in . Normandy for the annual D-Day memorial are among those opposed to plans . to erect a wind farm offshore from the landings site . Last month a campaign was launched on the 67th anniversary of D-Day to prevent the French government 'desecrating' the beaches with the wind farm. David Churchcroft, a former infantryman who stormed ashore with the British 2nd Army on June 6th 1944, said: 'It will change the entire seascape, destroying a view which evokes memories of the most astonishing invasion in military history. 'This is sacred ground, and the French should not be allowed to alter its character.'","Premier says yes to plans just seven miles off Normandy coast .

"The Church of Scientology ran a . 60-second commercial in several major metropolitan markets including New .

The video ran on television for the first time more than a month ago. Scroll down for video . Odd appearance: The Church of Scientology ran a 60-second commercial in several major metropolitan markets including New York and Los Angeles during Super Bowl XLVII on Sunday . On-air proselytizing: 'To the curious, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,' the commercial's an unseen narrator says. 'To the ones who just want to know about life, about the universe, about yourself' Knowledge is power: The spot is part of the Church's new 'Knowledge' campaign, encouraging its members to take certainty in themselves . The organization paid close to $8 million to air the spot during the big game, which is the largest one-day televised event in terms of ad spending. The ad features young actors as well as images of libraries, caverns, scriptures, outer space, and a mysterious-looking fortuneteller stroking a crystal ball, among other cryptic scenery that runs over soft, hypnotic music. The spot that aired during the Super Bowl, entitled ‘Knowledge,’ was actually published on the Church’s YouTube page in December, but hit the mass market last night. As of Monday morning, the video has nearly 89,000 views. The ad is in-line with one of the core beliefs of the religion, which include knowledge, responsibility, and control. Within the past month, the controversial organization has uploaded nearly two dozen videos, many of them tours of different branches of the Church across the country. More ads were broadcast during other prime time events this year, like the Golden Globes, Miss America pageant, and the NFL playoffs leading up to the Super Bowl. ‘Not cute questions, big questions, one’s that matter,’ the unseen narrator says. ‘To the rebels, the artists, the free thinkers and the innovators who care less about labels and more about truth.’ The ad is similar to Apple's classic 'Think Different' commercial from 1997, media observers noted, using the same basic format, a deep-voiced male narrator, and slow, inspirational music. Representatives from the Church told MailOnline that it has been running television spots since 2009, with this particular ad debuting on the religion's website in November 2012. A spokesperson said via email: 'As a matter of policy, we do not disclose the ad budget. However, we are very happy with the interest that the ad has generated.' The reaction on Twitter and other social media sites was one of mockery, with several jabs from people in the video game industry. 'If your church has an ad during the Super Bowl it's stops becoming a religion and starts becoming a punch line'  Kevin Dent, chief operating officer of the mobile video game network P4RC  wrote on Twitter after the spot ran. 'Hey America, if The Church of Scientology has enough cash to advertise during the Super Bowl, maybe it shouldn't be tax exempt,' IGN.com editor Scott Lowe wrote. The general consensus on social media was one of confusion, amusement, and wry entertainment. One Twitter user, @JoshCharles, wrote: ‘good game but so-so commercial (sic)… like the bud light stevie wonder and cars. Com wolf one. But scientology? What?’ But everyday viewers weren’t the only ones poking fun at the spot. Bill Maher wrote: ‘I saw an ad for Scientology, I joined, and then Destiny’s Child reunited! That s*** works – thanks, Tom Cruise!’ Doree Shafrir, the executive editor of Buzzfeed, tweeted: ‘Love how everyone in LA thinks the Scientology ad was local. Nope, THEY’RE COMING FOR ALL OF US.’ Big business: The Church of Scientology and its network of corporations, non-profits and other legal entities reportedly bring in more than $500 million a year from the organization's paying members and other revenue sources .

Then and now: The controversial Church was founded by fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, left, and is currently helmed by David Miscavage, right . The Church of Scientology and its network of corporations, non-profits and other legal entities bring in more than $500 million a year from the organization's paying members and other revenue sources according to a 2008 report in Upstart Business Journal. The church is run like a franchise, as each of its locations is separately incorporated and has its own local board of directors and executives responsible for that church's activities and financial operations. The first Scientology church was incorporated in December 1953 in Camden, New Jersey, by the religion's founder L. Ron Hubbard, his wife Mary Sue Hubbard, and their colleague John Galusha. Hubbard, a science fiction writer, said at that time, 'A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology.' The church's current members include several celebrities. Among them are actors Tom Cruise, Jason Lee and Juliette Lewis, rapper Doug E. Fresh, musician Beck and television host Greta Van Susteren. The organization has come under fire in recent years for alleged accounts of bigotry, deceptive means of recruitment and smear campaigns against its opponents, among other reported violations. The Scientology commercial's YouTube page, which went live on December 18, had just 60,000 views as of Sunday night, compared with more than 7 million views for Volkswagon's much talked about 'Get Happy' Super Bowl commercial, which was posted on YouTube last week. Original run: The controversial religious institution, which some have compared to a cult, aired its 'Knowledge' spot in select cities during the AFC Championship two weeks ago . Closing words: 'In the eternal debate for answers, the one thing that's true is what's true for you' the commercial's narrator concludes . To the curious. The inquisitive. The seekers of knowledge. To the ones who just wanna know. About life. About the universe. About yourself. Not cute questions. Big questions, ones that matter. To the rebels, the artists, the free thinkers and the innovators. Who care less about labels and more about truth. Who believe non-conformity is more than a bumper sticker. That knowledge is more than words on a page. You're young. You're old. You're powerful beyond measure and the fuel of that power is not magic or mysticism, but knowledge. The things you see. The things you feel. The things you know to be true. Sure, some will doubt you. Let 'em. Dare to think for yourself. To look for yourself. To make up your own mind.

"A fascinating 18th Century ‘prenup’ between Napoleon Bonaparte and his first wife Josephine is set to be auctioned in Paris. It suggests that the legendary couple, who married in 1796, were just as concerned about protecting their personal wealth as any rich man and wife living today. The contract will be auctioned in the French capital on September 21th, and is expected to go for up to £80,000. I aint sayin' she a golddigger: A ‘prenup’ between Napoleon Bonaparte and his first wife Josephine de Beauharnais is set to fetch £80,000 at auction . Not only did both Josephine and Napoleon lie about their age in the documents, but they failed to disclose assets in case they had to divide them following a separation. The contract states that the pair will ‘in no way be responsible for the debts and mortgages of the other’ and that there will be ‘no common property’. Josephine was six years older than her lover – something that was likely to provoke a scandal at the time, because she would have been expected to produce an heir. Josephine de Beauharnais was also a widow well known for her passionate affairs with a number of men when she became Napoleon’s mistress in 1795. Older women: Napoleon was 26 when he married Josephine - a 33-year-old widow . He was 26 at the time, and already a brilliantly successful military commander who would go on to become Emperor of France. The national hero was very wary of . losing his growing wealth, as was Josephine, who had been married to . Alexandre de Beauharnais, an aristocrat guillotined during the French . Revolution. A law of 1795 . allowed Josephine to reclaim her dead husband’s assets, and she was . determined to hang on with them, along with her two children. Napoleon's . mother and sisters were particularly resentful of his marriage to . Josephine, because she made them feel unsophisticated. It . was for these reasons that an old fashioned version of the prenuptial . agreement was signed by both on March 8, 1796, the day before their . wedding. Although nothing . like as complicated as it would be today ‘it is a contract which is full . of anecdotes,’ said Jean-Christophe Chataignier, of auctioneers Osenat. ‘It may look simple - you . have all the normal artefacts you'd find in a marriage contract, but . when you study it closely it gives us lots of information about how . things might be divided.’ As . it turned out, the marriage lasted less than a decade and was annulled . by the Pope when Josephine failed to give Napoleon children. The relationship was often used by the British to mock Napoleon, along with his relatively small height. ‘Boney’ was meant to have regularly said ‘Not tonight, Josephine’ because he . could not keep up with Josephine's sexual demands, but this is in fact a . myth.","Prenup between Napoleon and his first wife Josephine goes on sale .

"A mother who pleaded guilty to fraudulently enrolling her six-year-old son in the wrong school district has been sentenced to five years in prison. Tonya McDowell sent her son to an elementary school in Norwalk, Connecticut, instead of her home city of Bridgeport. The 34-year-old, who was homeless when she was charged with felony larceny last year, said she wanted the best education possible for the boy. Jailed: Tracy McDowell pleaded guilty to fraudulently enrolling her six-year-old son in the wrong school district and has been sentenced to five years in prison . McDowell last week entered her plea at . Norwalk Superior Court under the Alford Doctrine, which means she does . not admit guilt but concedes the state has enough evidence to convict . her. Authorities told the hearing that she . used a babysitter's address to enroll her son in kindergarten in Norwalk . when he should have attended schools in Bridgeport, her last permanent . address. Her case drew national attention and support from civil rights leaders and other advocates who wanted the charge dismissed. Good intentions: The 34-year-old, who was homeless when she was charged last year, said she wanted the best education possible for her son . McDowell told police she was living in . a van and occasionally slept at a Norwalk shelter or a friend's . Bridgeport apartment when she enrolled her son Norwalk's Brookside . Elementary School. Police said McDowell stole $15,686 worth of 'free' educational services from Norwalk. She also pleaded guilty to four counts of sale of narcotics, which will be included in her prison sentence. In a separate case, she pleaded guilty on February 7 to selling drugs. Sign: The school in Norwalk, Connecticut, at the centre of the controversy .

"A husband is suing hospital officials in China after he found his dead wife alone on an operating table following the birth of their son. Liu Hsiung, 29, had asked nurses for updates on his wife Zhang Chun, 27, after he was warned she was suffering critical complications at the Xiangtan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, in southern China. He said: 'I kept being told she was in the operating theatre, but it looked at if it was closed and no one was there.' WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Liu Hsiung is suing a hospital in China after he found his dead wife alone on an operating table following the birth of their child . Hsiung, 29, had asked nurses for updates on his wife Zhang Chun, 27, after he was warned she was suffering critical complications . Hours later Hsuing finally managed to force his way into the operating theatre, where he found his wife's body on the table with a cleaner sitting nearby smoking a cigarette and eating a coconut. The baby survived the birth. He said: 'I was going out of my mind outside wondering what had happened, yet they had gone home and my dead wife was left on a table in front of a guy eating his lunch.' He added: 'When I got into the room it was too late she was already dead and none of the surgical or medical team were anywhere to be seen.' Hospital officials have said complications arose after Hsiung and his wife Chun refused a Caesarean section because the baby was so large. A hospital spokesman said: 'After giving birth, the patient suffered from excessive bleeding. 'As an emergency her uterus was removed after five hours, but it was not enough to save her, and she passed away that night.' Hospital officials have said complications arose after Hsiung and his wife Chun (pictured) refused a Caesarean section because the baby was so large . An official inquiry found Chun died of a rare condition, an amniotic fluid embolism. But Hsiung is suing hospital authorities for compensation claiming they bungled the delivery. 'The reason they kept me away for so long was to give themselves time to cook up their story and get rid of incriminating evidence,' he said. 'But I want to see all the papers, all the medical records and all the statements,' added Hsiung. A hospital spokesman confirmed: 'We are in negotiations with the patient's husband and family over compensation. We admit that not everything went as it should have done in this case.'","Liu Hsiung asked nurses for updates after he was warned of complications .

"An American tycoon has refused to rescue a doomed tyre factory in northern France because its workers are 'lazy, overpaid and talk too much'. Maurice Taylor - chairman of U.S. tyre giant Titan International - issued the slur in a blunt letter to French industry ministry Arnaud Montebourg. In the letter, Mr Taylor explained why his company would not be buying a Goodyear tyre plant in Amiens that is threatened with closure and the loss of 1,170 jobs. Discontent: Workers leave the Goodyear tyre plant in Amiens which is set to close but tycoon Maurice Taylor has said he has no interest in taking over the factory . He told Mr Montebourg: 'I have visited the factory several times. The French workforce gets paid high wages but works only three hours. 'They get one hour for breaks and lunch, talk for three hours and work for three. I told the French union workers this to their faces. They told me that's the French way! 'Titan is the one with the money and the talent to produce tyres. What does the crazy union have? It has the French government. 'The French farmer wants cheap tires. He does not care if the tyres come from India or China and these governments are subsidizing them. Your government doesn't care either.' Goodyear said on January 31 that it would be closing its main French plant and cutting its workforce in France by 39 percent amid labor disputes and plunging car demand in Europe. Closing: Goodyear has said it will shut  its main French plant and cut its workforce by 39 per cent due to plunging car demand in Europe . Mr Taylor added in the letter published in the les Echoes financial newspaper: 'Goodyear tried for over four years to save some of the highest-paid Amiens jobs, but the French unions and the French government did nothing but talk.' The embarrassing assessment of French workers comes as France teeters on the brink of recession and unemployment has hit three million - the highest level of joblessness in 15 years. Four years ago, former French finance minister Christine Lagarde - now head of the International Monetary Fund - also branded leisure-loving French workers as 'lethargic'. She told French newsapers: 'Instead of thinking about their work, people think about their weekends, organising, planning and engineering time off. 'If you say to a French person, ""Would you like to be an entrepreneur?"" all they do is run scared.' A recent global study of working hours also revealed the French worked the fewest hours of any country on earth. The report by Swiss bank UBS found the French graft for just 1,480 hours a year, with 27 days annual holiday - meaning they have more free time than any other nation on the planet. Britons work 1,782 hours a year - 301 more than the French - and have 20 days holiday a year, making us the world's 36th most lazy nation, it was found.","Maurice Taylor is the chairman of U.S. tyre giant Titan International .

"A Marine veteran jailed in a dangerous area of Mexico for carrying a gun across the border was expected to be released today, his lawyer said. The Mexican attorney general's office told U.S. Senator Bill Nelson about the pending release after Nelson's office got word from the mother of Jon Hammar. 'No American should be in a Mexican jail for five months without being able to have his case in front of a judge,' Senator Nelson said. 'We're grateful, this is a good Christmas present.' Hammar's attorney Eddie Varon Levy said he was flying on Friday from Mexico City to Matamoros to pick his client up. Scroll down for video . Going home: Ex-Marine Jon Hammar, pictured from his Mexican jail cell with shackles on his leg, returned to the U.S. last month . After that, the attorney said they . intended to fly to Brownsville, Texas, later in the day. 'I'm very . happy. I feel that the Mexican legal system came out the way it should . have,' he said. A defense lawyer said it was . determined there was no intent to commit a crime. A  U.S. Consulate . official said they are standing by to escort the former Marine safely . back to the United States as soon as they get official word of a . release. Nelson was among a handful of local . elected officials who urged the State Department to help get Hammar out . of Mexico. His family said he was being held in isolation after they . received threats to his safety. Freed: Marine Jon Hammer has been stuck in a Mexican jail since August, when he was detained on a weapons charge . Civilian gun ownership is illegal . under Mexican law unless the owner purchases the weapon from a special . shop run by the country's Department of Defense. 'The Department of State warns all . U.S. citizens against taking any type of firearm or ammunition into . Mexico,' according to the website of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. 'Entering Mexico with a firearm, . certain types of knives, or even a single round of ammunition is . illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into Mexico . unintentionally.' Mexican law also bans shotguns with barrels of less than 25 inches. The family said Hammar's shotgun has a barrel of 24 inches. Tourists are allowed to bring guns . for hunting on rare occasions, but Mexican officials said all visitors . must receive a special permit before entering the country. Mexican . customs agents do not issue gun permits. As a result, anyone crossing . the border with a firearm or ammunition without a previously issued . government permit is in instant violation of Mexican law, which . stipulates long jail terms for breaking weapons laws. Hammar and his friend were on their . way to Costa Rica in August and planned to drive across the Mexican . border near Matamoros in a Winnebago filled with surfboards and camping . gear. Hammar, 27, asked U.S. border agents what to do with the unloaded . shotgun. His family said agents told them to fill out a form for the gun, which belonged to Hammar's great-grandfather. But when the pair crossed the border . and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and . jailed the men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun. Hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to . him. Varon Levy said he was not sure of Hammar's immediate plans once he returns to the U.S. 'Probably some down time,' he said. Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico . Distraught family: Hammar's parents Jon and Olivia Hammar, fought for their son's safe return from Mexico . A photo of Marine Veteran Jon . Hammar, held captive in one of Mexico’s most infamous prisons for four . months, showed him in a solitary cell inside Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas, shirtless, barefoot and chained by handcuffs around his right ankle. He was photographed sitting on an thin mattress with a red blanket in a room with chipped walls and a squalid floor. He does not appear to have any visible injuries. The email containing the photo was sent anonymously to Hammar's mother from a Yahoo.mx account. Hammar served in Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2007. His mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hammar developed PTSD following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet . when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq. He had just completed . treatment at a center for veterans in California last year, . before getting detained during his misadventure in Matamoros.
