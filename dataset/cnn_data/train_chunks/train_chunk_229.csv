"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra faces a no-confidence motion in parliament as opposition forces in the Asian nation try to unseat the government through legal means. The vote is currently scheduled for Thursday, but the opposition's chances of success appear slim, as Yingluck's party has a majority. Protesters are calling for an end to the government of Yingluck, sister of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecommunications tycoon who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Critics of the Thai prime minister accuse her of being a puppet of her older brother Thaksin, a deeply polarizing figure who was removed from power by the military while in New York in 2006. He has since lived in exile, except for a brief return in 2008, and was convicted by Thai courts for corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in jail later that year. Meanwhile, thousands of anti-government demonstrators have kept up pressure on the Thai government in recent days by surrounding official buildings amid the highest tensions the country has seen since deadly unrest three years ago. Protesters in Bangkok stormed the finance ministry building Monday and turned into their secondary command center. They planned to send groups to a range of other ministries and government offices around the capital Wednesday, said Akanat Promphan, a spokesman for the protesters. Their objectives include the public health, labor, industry, social development and science ministries, as well as a government complex that houses multiple agencies, notably the Department of Special Investigation. The number of demonstrators, led by the opposition Democrat Party, has declined from the huge gathering of roughly 100,000 people that assembled in Bangkok on Sunday. Akanat said the protesters believe their current numbers to be in the tens of thousands, perhaps as many as 50,000. But authorities estimate the number of demonstrators to be around 10,000, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut of the National Security Council. Certain sections of some roads in Bangkok have been shut down because of the number of protesters camping out and spilling into the street, Paradon said. Rising to a crescendo . More than three weeks of anti-government protests led by the Democrat Party rose to a crescendo with the big demonstration Sunday. The protesters have since taken their rallies directly to government offices, TV networks and military installations. At various points during the past few days, demonstrators have surrounded the foreign ministry, as well as the agriculture and interior ministries. Yingluck has said authorities will ""absolutely not use violence"" to disperse the demonstrators. But the situation is delicate after Thai police issued an arrest warrant against protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. Paradon of the National Security Council said Wednesday that authorities are ""sticking with negotiation"" and trying to persuade Suthep to hand himself in. Authorities have extended the areas around Bangkok where police are enforcing an internal security law that restricts gatherings by demonstrators. Political fault lines . The current protests have reanimated the tensions along Thailand's political fault lines -- Thaksin Shinawatra's mostly rural support base on one side, the Bangkok-based elite and middle classes on the other -- that left the country wracked with turbulence for four years after the 2006 coup, culminating in a 2010 army crackdown on Thaksin supporters that left more than 90 dead. The current round of protests was triggered in response to a government-backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to Thaksin Shinawatra and opened the door for his return to Thailand. The Thai senate rejected the amnesty bill on November 11, but since then demonstrations continued, with the opposition calling for the current government to be replaced by a new administration. More than a dozen countries have issued travel warnings for citizens to avoid areas near protests in Bangkok. CNN's Anna Coren contributed to this report.","NEW Thai PM Yingluck faces no confidence motion in Thailand's parliament on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a dream trip: Two children and their parents on a yearlong family road trip around Australia. But the dream turned to tragedy Wednesday when the parents apparently got into trouble while swimming off a remote beach in Western Australia, while their children, ages 10 and 12, were on shore. The children watched as other beachgoers desperately tried to resuscitate their mother after her body drifted ashore, CNN's Australian affiliate ABC News reported. The children had spotted their mother floating face-down in the water, ABC News said. Their father was also briefly seen floating face-down before disappearing under water, the broadcaster said. Kathreen Ricketson, 41, is believed to have drowned, Western Australia police said. The search continued Thursday for her husband, 48-year-old Robert Shugg, but there is little hope of finding him alive. ""His body hasn't been recovered,"" 1st Class Constable Richard Du Cloux of Exmouth police told CNN. ""The search is still going on and will continue until all avenues have been exhausted."" The children have been reunited with family members, Du Cloux said. The family was camping by Ningaloo Reef, a remote but beautiful spot about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Coral Bay, when disaster struck. Ricketson, who described herself online as ""mother.maker.wife.artist.writer.traveller. Adventuring with my family on year-long road trip around Australia,"" had been blogging about their trip. Her last entry, posted Monday, reads: ""We are bush camping at a station on Ningaloo reef, Western Australia. A dream come true -- is that totally corn ball?"" They had met another family there, Ricketson's blog said, and the children were enjoying playing together. A photo of a beach at sunset posted to Instagram by Ricketson on Sunday was captioned: ""Ningaloo beach for Robbie's birthday. Sweet."" ""It's an extremely remote, rugged area,"" said Du Cloux. ""People go camping there, (but) you've got to be fully self-sufficient, there's no amenities at all."" The alarm was raised by a fellow camper, who set off an emergency positioning beacon, Du Cloux said. The nearest police station, in Exmouth, is about 2Â½ hours away. Efforts to find the body of the children's missing father are being led by the police and Department of Environment and Conservation officials, he said. An aerial search will resume at daylight Friday. This kind of incident is thankfully unusual in the area, Du Cloux said. The family set off on their road trip -- described by Ricketson as a ""12 month family sabbatical to reconnect as a family and slow down our life"" -- in early January. The parents planned to home-school the children on the road and continue their online work, according to her blog. Ricketson ran a crafts and lifestyle website, Whip Up, as well as a children's activities website, Action Pack Magazine. ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic news of the sudden death of Whip Up founder, Kathreen Ricketson. Her partner Rob Shugg is still missing at Coral Bay, Western Australia. Their two gorgeous, beloved children, to whom we send our love, are with relatives,"" a post by a contributor to the Whip Up site said Thursday.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Thick fog and steep, mountainous terrain forced rescuers to halt their efforts to reach the wreckage of a Russian jetliner that crashed on a demonstration flight in Indonesia, the country's state news agency reported Thursday. The Sukhoi Superjet 100 came to rest on the side of Mount Salak, a volcano south of Jakarta, Vice Marshal Daryatmo, head of the National Search and Rescue Agency, told the Indonesian news agency Antara. Efforts to reach the wreck are expected to resume Friday morning, said Daryatmo, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ""We have identified the crash coordinates, but our personnel have not yet arrived at the location,"" Antara quoted Daryatmo as saying. ""However, because there is thick fog covering Mount Salak and the tilt of the cliff is 85 degrees, the evacuation process has been halted until tomorrow morning."" The Russian Investigative Committee said 48 people were on board the plane, including eight Russian crew members. But the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti said the number was 45, citing Sukhoi Civil Aviation President Vladimir Prisyazhnyuk as saying three of the people on the passenger list did not board the flight. The wreckage was spotted at an elevation of about 5,800 feet (nearly 1,800 meters). Gagah Prakoso, a spokesman for the rescue agency, said the authorities hope to start removing bodies from the area by helicopter Friday, and there has been no sign that anyone survived. Daryatmo said the Sukhoi logo had been identified amid the wreckage of the plane, which disappeared off radar screens Wednesday. An image released by the Indonesian military showed bits of debris strewn across a patch of steep mountainside that had been stripped bare of the thick surrounding vegetation. The cause of the crash remained unclear. The Russian Investigative Committee said it had launched a criminal probe into possible safety violations. The plane was on a demonstration flight for Indonesian Ministry of Transportation officials and representatives of Indonesian airlines, the Russian Embassy in Jakarta said before the crash. Indonesia's Sky Aviation signed a $380 million deal in 2011 to buy 12 Sukhoi Superjet 100s, and press reports said a number of Sky employees were on the plane that went down. Sukhoi employees are also among the missing. It was the first crash of a Sukhoi Superjet 100, RIA-Novosti said. The plane was on its second demonstration flight Wednesday when it lost contact with air controllers at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. ""The first demonstration flight in the morning went smoothly. There were no problems,"" said Sunaryo, an official with Sukhoi's Indonesian agent, Trimarga Rekatama, who also uses only one name. On the second flight, the plane began making its descent but vanished from radar screens at 6,200 feet in a mountainous area. The plane lost contact with air traffic controllers at 2:12 p.m., 21 minutes after taking off, said Daryatmo, the rescue agency chief. Two helicopters were immediately sent out to search for the plane but had to return to their bases because of strong winds and unpredictable weather. The Sukhoi jet arrived in Jakarta as part of a demonstration tour of six Asian countries. It had been to Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and was scheduled to visit Laos and Vietnam after Indonesia, RIA-Novosti said. Sukhoi manufactures military aircraft and is known especially for its fighter jets. Its civilian aircraft is narrow-bodied with a dual-class cabin that can transport 100 passengers over regional routes. It flew its maiden flight in 2008. In March, a Superjet 100 operated by Russia's Aeroflot Airlines was forced to abandon its flight to Astrakhan, Russia, and return to Moscow because of problems with the undercarriage, according to RIA Novosti. A similar defect in another Aeroflot-operated Superjet 100 plane had to be fixed in Minsk in December. Russia's state-run United Aircraft Corp. said the defect did not affect passenger safety. CNN's Alla Eshchenko in Moscow contributed to this report.","NEW: Fog and steep terrain force a halt to the search, official says .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- From the uncertainty that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union, a newly invigorated Russia has emerged, displaying unprecedented political, military and economic confidence that has, at times, put it on a collision course with the West. A resurgent Russia has been flexing its military, political and economic muscles. With no sign of strongman Vladimir Putin taking a political backseat, Russia looks set to continue its bid to regain superpower status, providing that its citizens can endure the crippling impact of the global financial crisis and shrug off fears that their newfound freedoms, outlook and relative prosperity will be short-lived. Here CNN Moscow Correspondent Matthew Chance explains what has driven Russia's re-emergence, how this has affected its role on the world stage, and what can be expected from the country in the future. Q: What has been the driving factor behind Russia's resurgence? A: Affluence was behind Russia's resurgence, but there's a real sense in which the global financial crisis has checked Russia's aspirations of a return to superpower status. Before the downturn, the booming price of commodities, such as gas and oil, of which Russia is big supplier, fueled prosperity and gave Russians a confidence they hadn't previously enjoyed. It also saw the Kremlin being taken much more seriously on the international stage, inserting itself into Middle East peace talks, the Iranian nuclear issue and a host of other issues. It has also encouraged Russia to assert its presence in what is known as the near-abroad -- the former Soviet states. Many of those states want to move towards NATO and Europe, but Russia wants to keep them within its sphere of influence. The obvious example of this is Russia's war last year with Georgia. After Georgia announced its intentions to sign up to NATO, Russia launched a military offensive much to the dismay of the international community. Q: Is there a change of atmosphere in Russia these days; are people more optimistic about the future than they were 10 or 15 years ago? A: Despite the financial crisis, people enjoy a lot more freedom and a lot more prosperity than they did 15 years ago, but there's a deep-seated insecurity among Russians that it could all -- the money, the freedom -- come to an end. Watching their currency collapse by 30 percent over the last year, unemployment soar 10 percent and industrial output plunge has made Russians very uncomfortable about the future. At the moment people don't see an end to the hardship. At the same time, the Kremlin has spent a lot of its hard currency softening the blow of the crisis, bolstering pensions and the welfare system, and that's been appreciated by many Russians too. Q: Is there much rose-tinted reminiscing about the past? A: There is on lots of levels, certainly among Russia's pensioners, who gave their lives to the cause of communism, fought in World War II against Nazi Germany and perhaps enjoyed a privileged position in Soviet society. There's a great sense of loss about the collapse and nostalgia about what were seen as the good things: strength, order and global power. The younger Russians didn't have that experience of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, icons of that period such as former Soviet leader Josef Stalin are still viewed with affection by many people in part because of what he represented: Russia as a world power. The idea that he oversaw brutal oppression is very much ignored. Q: Are there any changes in the way Russia sees the rest of the world? A: Yes, not least because in the Soviet period people didn't get to travel overseas and foreigners always viewed Russia with suspicion. This has started to change noticeably. Russians are more visibly internationally. They go on holiday all over the world: Turkey, Thailand, the South of France, the Caribbean. They are much more assimilated into the global village than they ever were during the Soviet period. This has broadened people's minds here and made them much more tolerant in their global outlook in general. Q: Will Vladimir Putin remain key to Russia's future? A: There is very little doubt in the mind of most Russians that Vladimir Putin remains not only a central figure in the country's decision making, but is perhaps the main decision maker. A recent opinion poll by an independent Levada-Center showed that 24 percent of Russians consider Putin to have the real power, compared to just 12 percent for his hand-picked successor, President Dmitry Medvedev. As for the future, in the past year since Medvedev was sworn in, there is very little sign he has stamped his mark. It still looks to domestic and international audiences that Putin is calling the shots. At this point it's hard to see any evidence that the situation is going to change.","Booming oil and gas prices have fueled Russia's recent prosperity .

"(CNN) -- They were 17-year-old high school students driving to a party at a gravel pit. Perhaps they took a wrong turn; perhaps there was foul play. For 42 years, authorities have had no idea how Cheryl Miller and Pamela Jackson disappeared. Now there may finally be answers. A car that appears to be theirs was spotted in a creek just half a mile from the girls' intended destination near Beresford, South Dakota, reported CNN affiliate KTIV-TV in Sioux City, Iowa. The license plate and hubcap match those of the car they were in when they vanished in 1971. Authorities in South Dakota said Tuesday that skeletal remains were recovered from the scene. South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley and Union County Sheriff Dan Limoges also said the vehicle, discovered in an embankment in Brule Creek, was processed and other items that potentially are evidence were discovered. The timing is especially poignant. Jackson's father died last week at the age of 102. His funeral was Saturday. The car was found Monday. It's caked in mud, which must be peeled off layer by layer, KTIV reported. Dry weather had depleted the creek of enough water that it became easy to see the car, the station said. A fisherman spotted the 1960 Studebaker Lark, said CNN affiliate KSFY-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Removing the car from the creek could take days, KSFY said. ""The case has been reopened multiple times over the decades, including in 2004, when the state's newly formed cold case unit searched a farm in rural Union County, two miles from the gravel pit,"" KSFY reported. Six years ago, state prison inmate David Lykken was charged in the case. But the charges were later dropped after a confession he gave turned out to be false, KSFY said. Last week, authorities found two cars, with human remains inside, at the bottom of an Oklahoma lake. Investigators said one car may have belonged to a teenager who disappeared with two friends in 1970. The other might be linked to the disappearance of a man in the 1960s.

"(CNN) -- The charity taking care of a blonde, blue-eyed girl taken by police from a Roma community in Greece has received 8,000 calls from around the world since it issued a call for help in finding her parents. ""At least eight calls have some information that can be used by the police for further investigation,"" Smile of the Child spokesman Panagiotis Pardalis said Sunday. ""Four of these calls are from the United States."" The group is working with Greek authorities, Interpol and Europol to solve the mystery of Maria, the name by which the couple posing as her parents called the 4-year-old. ""This Roma family had 14 children in total, and they were registered with fake birth certificates, so now the police are trying to see whether these children also belong to this family or if there is something else behind this,"" Pardalis said. The girl was immediately taken from the couple and entrusted to the care of the Smile of the Child, which will keep her in one of its group homes until her family is found. ""The girl is at peace,"" Pardalis said. ""She is doing much better."" A prosecutor became suspicious when he saw the child with very pale skin in a community of Roma, also known as gypsies, near the town of Larissa in central Greece, Pardalis said. ""It was bad living conditions, poor hygiene. The girl was found in a state of neglect, both physically and psychologically,"" he said. ""We don't have any other information, if this girl was forced to work or to beg on streets."" When the couple was questioned, ""they changed repeatedly their story about how they got the child,"" a police statement said, compounding the officers' suspicions. DNA testing then ""showed that there was not any genetic compatibility"" between the girl and the 39-year-old man and the 40-year-old woman, the police said, meaning they cannot be her biological parents. Photo blog: The plight of the Roma . The two people posing as her parents have been arrested and face charges of abducting a minor, as well as counts of falsifying identity documents, said the state-owned Athens-Macedonian News Agency. Among the suspect documents found by police was a 2009 birth and baptism registration from Athens authorities, the news agency said. The woman also had two different valid identification documents and, based on family registration records, appears to have given birth to three children between June and November 1993 and another three children between October 1994 and February 1995, it said. In fact, the state-run AMNA news agency reported, she had two family residence registrations indicating that she was mother to 10 children: five girls and a boy in Larissa, plus four girls in Trikala. The man is registered as the father of four more children. Greece's government has promised to help the child. In the meantime, the little girl is being given support by a police psychologist, the police said. Anyone with information is asked to call the European Hotline for Missing Children or contact the Smile of the Child. The girl's discovery will probably prompt speculation that she may have been abducted or trafficked, which, if proved, could serve to fuel prejudice against the Roma community within Greece and elsewhere. Rights group Amnesty International has called on the European Union to take action to end discrimination against the 6 million Roma, describing them as ""the largest and most disadvantaged minority in the region."" In May, Amnesty International said Greece had been found guilty of discrimination against Roma schoolchildren in three rulings by the European Court of Human Rights.

"LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters)  -- Massive dogs belonging to ""Mission: Impossible"" star Ving Rhames attacked and killed a live-in caretaker at the actor's Los Angeles home Friday, police said. A sign on the gate of actor Ving Rhames' home points out that a dog is on the premises. The caretaker, whose name was not released by authorities, was found dead on the front lawn of Rhames' gated home in an expensive Brentwood neighborhood, covered in dog bites, a Los Angeles police spokesman said. Several large dogs were running loose on the property when police responded to the scene shortly after 7:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. ET) and animal control officers took three huge bull mastiffs and an English bulldog into custody. ""It appeared that the person suffered a number of injuries as a result of the dog mauling,"" Sgt. Lee Sands said. ""There were numerous dog bites all over his body, but the exact cause of death is pending the coroner's ruling."" Sands said four dogs, the largest weighing nearly 200 pounds, were being quarantined as part of an investigation into the attack. He said it was not yet clear how many of the dogs had taken part in the mauling or why they had turned on the caretaker. The victim, who worked for Rhames for two years and lived on the property, was pronounced dead at the scene. Television pictures showed the body being removed from the scene, covered in a blanket. Neighbors said that they had never seen signs of aggression from the dogs. Representatives for Rhames, who is out of the country shooting a film, had no immediate comment. The 46-year-old actor is known for starring in ""Pulp Fiction"" and alongside Tom Cruise in all three ""Mission: Impossible"" movies. Rhames has a long list of film and television credits. He won a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for starring as Don King in a 1997 TV movie about the flamboyant boxing promoter. The actor discussed dogs during a 1999 interview with the Los Angeles Times, describing a 1-year-old Fila Brasileiro (Brazilian Mastiff) he owned at the time as having been bred to guard slaves. ""It was the only dog they found that had the temperament to guard a slave,"" Rhames said in the interview. ""It could be around you every day, but if you tried to run away..."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- In an escalation of its civil war, Syria is firing more Scud missiles in a desperate attempt to quash rebel gains, the NATO chief said Friday. The government has launched more missiles in recent days, according to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary-general of the alliance. Read more: Syrian fight now ""overtly sectarian,"" U.N. says . ""I can confirm that we have detected the launch of Scud-type missiles,"" he said. ""I consider it an act of a desperate regime approaching collapse."" Though the missiles have not hit Turkey, he said, the development highlights the need for a protection plan for the neighboring nation. A Turkish Foreign Ministry official told CNN on Friday that some Scuds had been fired from Damascus toward Aleppo early Thursday. ""As far as I know, (there were) four, (landing) around Aleppo and/or close to our border, but not in Turkey,"" said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the record for military matters. A NATO official told CNN that Syria had fired about half a dozen Scud-B missiles in the northern part of the country, one of which landed just 20 miles from the Turkish border. The preliminary assessment is the Scud launches were aimed at rebel munitions storage sites, said the official, who has direct knowledge of the latest intelligence but declined to be identified because of its sensitivity. Read more: U.N. announces $1.5 billion aid effort for refugees . Intelligence analysts believe the Syrian government now uses Scuds when the weather is bad and aircraft cannot launch ground attacks. This is the first acknowledgment of new Scud launches since an initial volley was confirmed by U.S. officials earlier this month. Using U.S. satellite imagery, along with U.S. and NATO radars and electronic signals intelligence, the United States and NATO can establish where the missiles were launched and where they landed. The official declined to offer specifics on the launch and aim points of the latest attacks, because of the sensitive nature of the information. But he said there was no indication the latest round of Scuds were armed with chemical munitions. He did not know if there were any casualties, as all the missiles landed inside Syria. The move is an escalation on the war, which has threatened to draw in neighboring countries and militant groups. Analysts say the government of President Bashar al-Assad maintains up to 400 of the short- and medium-range Russian-developed Scud missiles. Read more: Syrian refugees on run: ""I want people to feel our pain"" NATO is in the final stages of preparing for a deployment of Patriot missiles from the United States, Germany and the Netherlands to Turkey for defense against Syrian Scuds that might threaten its neighbor. Final site surveys are under way, and the deployment of six Patriot batteries in Turkey is expected to be completed by the end of January. The Syrian civil war started in March 2011 when a government crackdown on civilian demonstrators morphed into a fight between the regime and rebels. More than 40,000 people are estimated to have died in nearly two years of conflict. At least 148 people were killed across Syria Friday, according to the Local Coordination Committee in Syria, a Syria-based opposition activist network.

"Sicily, Italy (CNN) -- The Portuguese CASA 295 military plane lifts off from an airstrip in Sicily and roars into the skies above the Mediterranean, scouring the blue seas below for signs of life. The state-of-the-art surveillance aircraft is flying for Frontex, the European Union's border patrol agency. Its mission isn't only to stop people from being smuggled onto the continent's southern shores -- it's to save lives. The plane patrols the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily, including the area around Lampedusa, an Italian island near the African coast that migrants have been trying to reach in often unseaworthy boats. In October more than 300 migrants died when their boat capsized near these shores, and Frontex is hoping to prevent that from happening again. INFOGRAPHIC: How illegal immigrants enter the EU . The Frontex crew took CNN along on a surveillance flight. Human trafficking in the region is big business, and we were not allowed to identify any of the mission's crew member for fear they could be targeted by gangs of smugglers. ""On the missions, every week we find three or four targets of interest,"" the aircraft's captain told CNN. ""The main goal is to detect targets of interest that Frontex [give us the coordinates for] ... we go there and we check it out and then we transmit everything to Frontex."" Fishing boats are often targets of interest because they are sometimes used to smuggle people from Africa to Europe. Often those vessels will be old, rusty and overloaded with migrants as the traffickers try to maximize their profit per journey. In some cases, sailing ships have been used for people smuggling as well. On our flight the crew also spotted an abandoned rubber boat, which might have been left there by people who made it to shore in Europe. OPINION: Europe's immigration nightmare just beginning . The plane is outfitted with infrared sensors and a belly camera that can identify and track targets at great distances. The crew will look for vessels that have an unusually high number of people on board, but they're also checking to see whether a ship move strangely in the water -- a possible sign that it is overloaded with migrants under deck. Several high profile incidents involving migrant boats from northern Africa have thrust the issue of illegal immigration to the forefront of European politics -- and now the EU is looking for ways to better regulate immigration while protecting the lives of those who try to make it to the continent. An increasing number of ill-equipped migrant ships are getting into trouble during their voyages towards Europe, and the Italian Navy and Coast Guard often need to speed to the rescue to save those on board. Most of them end up in migrant camps in Italy, Greece or Malta. The Pozallo camp in southern Sicily is one of the bigger ones, with over 400 people living on site. OPINION: EU must solve crisis to deserve Nobel Prize . One of those recently saved from the seas is Henry Linus from Nigeria. He says the ship he was on got into a storm and was adrift at sea before they were rescued. ""There was no food, [there was] excrement inside the boat. People were vomiting inside the boat, we were vomiting everywhere. It was horrible,"" he told CNN. Linus added that if given the chance to do it all over again, he would not try to make the treacherous journey to Europe. Andrea Tassara is the Commander of the Italian Coast guard in Pozallo, one of the busiest Coast Guards in Europe. He always has two high-speed boats on standby that can go about 30 knots and take on as many as 130 people from other boats or from the sea. Tassara says he and his men are appalled at some of the boats they come upon while patrolling the Mediterranean. ""The most dangerous thing is when you see a boat that is made of really old wood. God knows how it is held together and it can fall apart just by our ships coming close,"" he said. But many people are so desperate that they are willing to take their chances. That cost more than 300 people their lives on October 3rd, when a boat originating from Libya was so overloaded and unstable that it capsized when a fire on board the vessel caused its passengers to panic. OPINION: What's the place of outsiders in Europe? Most of those who drowned were Eritreans. At the Pozallo camp we met an Eritrean man who said that he was supposed to be on the boat that sank, but that it was so full he was rejected and had to wait for a later ship. He says many people who had spent the last couple of years fighting their way through African deserts to the coast had died in the shipwreck. ""Some of us had parents or wives or children on there, we were part of that group. But fortunately the boat was full and we were obliged to stay,"" he told CNN. Italian Coast Guard Commander Tassara says the increase in migrant boats trying to get to Europe is huge, even though he cannot put numbers on it. He says the waves of ships usually stop in the fall and winter months, but this year there has been no let-up. He attributes that in part to good weather conditions on the sea, but also to the growing despair in places like Syria, Eritrea, and Nigeria, where many are now trying to flee the violent extremist group Boko Haram. It does not look like those waves will stop. Even if Europe further beefs up its patrols on its borders, they might be able to contain migration for a while, but they will never be able to stop it.","CNN goes on patrol with EU border agency searching Mediterranean for migrant boats .

"(CNN) -- Twelve former students now face manslaughter charges in the November 2011 hazing death of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion Jr., attorneys familiar with the case said Monday. Ten of them were previously charged with felony hazing resulting in death. They and two new defendants will now also be charged with manslaughter, said Craig Brown, the attorney for one of the students. State Attorney Jeff Ashton ""thought the proper charges in the case would be manslaughter and hazing with death,"" explained Assistant State Attorney Nicole Pegues in an e-mail sent to the defendants' attorneys. Brown's client, Aaron Golson, was among those charged with third-degree felony hazing. He now also faces a manslaughter charge, according to Brown. FAMU pledges reforms after report on hazing . ""I really find this to be a tactic by the state to pressure all of the defendants into some sort of prison time,"" Brown told CNN. ""Clearly a manslaughter charge could have been brought about initially."" The defendants face a maximum of 15 years in prison with the charge, if convicted, Brown said. He expects the next hearing to be in September. Champion, 26, died after a band hazing ritual in which he was beaten aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida.

"(CNN) -- Sentencing was delayed Tuesday for a Somali pirate who prosecutors say led the attack on a U.S. vessel off the coast of Africa last year. The sentencing hearing for Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse was adjourned until a later date. No reason was immediately provided by the court or prosecutors for the delay. Muse has pleaded guilty to charges he hijacked the ship and kidnapped its captain. Prosecutors say Muse acted as the ringleader when he and three other men seized the U.S-flagged Maersk Alabama by force about 350 miles off the coast of Somalia on April 8, 2009. Once on board, the armed men demanded the ship be stopped, then took a lifeboat and held the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, hostage on it. When he entered his plea on May 18, Muse apologized for his actions and blamed the incident on the Somali government. ""What we did was wrong. I am very sorry for all of this,"" Muse said in a soft voice. ""All of this happened because of the government in Somalia."" In addition to the Maersk Alabama, Muse was charged with participating in the hijacking of two other vessels in late March and early April of 2009. Muse told the court that he and the three other men agreed to ""capture any ship that came by."" He added that he did not recognize the U.S. flag on the Maersk Alabama. Muse and his cohorts held Philips hostage for four days on the lifeboat. The USS Bainbridge, a U.S. Navy destroyer, came to the assistance of the vessel, and in radio communications, the pirates threatened to kill Phillips if they were not guaranteed safe passage away from the scene, authorities have said. Four days after the hijacking began, Muse boarded the Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the others in exchange for Phillips' release, according to a criminal complaint. While he was away from the lifeboat, Navy SEAL snipers shot and killed the three remaining pirates, authorities said. Muse was then taken into custody. Muse could receive a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars. CNN's Hussein Saddique and Cheryl Robinson contributed to this report.","NEW: No reason given for postponement .

"Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- The Virginia governor's race, billed as the marquee battle of an otherwise anticlimactic 2013 election cycle, is shaping up to be a foregone conclusion. Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the longtime political fixer and moneyman, hasn't trailed in a poll since May. Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. In recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year's GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor's mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. Not so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. But despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign. Here's what you need to know about this year's most important race: . 1. The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats . McAuliffe isn't exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, ""the Macker"" has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. But Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot. A Washington Post poll last week showed that two-thirds of McAuliffe supporters said they were voting against Cuccinelli, rather than for McAuliffe. How did the Dems do it? With a relentless focus on Cuccinelli's conservative record on women's health issues, a playbook that President Barack Obama's campaign employed to great effect in 2012 against GOP nominee Mitt Romney. And Romney was never as conservative as Cuccinelli. Obama campaigns for McAuliffe in Virginia . ""It is impossible to be the candidate of the tea party and still be the candidate of the center,"" argued McAuliffe's pollster, Geoff Garin. In TV ad after TV ad, voters in this swing state were told of Cuccinelli's record on abortion, contraception and domestic violence. Some of the claims were stretches maybe, but welcome to politics. At the same time, McAuliffe ""seized the center,"" his campaign aides say, drawing some business-friendly Republican politicians and a few GOP donors to his side. The message from Republicans has been muddy. One week, they were hitting McAuliffe over a sputtering car company he founded, and the next they were calling attention to his attempts to expand a business venture in China. Thoughout the race, Cuccinelli's campaign has called McAuliffe ""deeply unserious"" -- even running a memorable ad with a clip of McAuliffe downing a shot of rum on live television -- but none of the attacks seemed to stick. The unwavering Democratic assault has worked. Romney lost the state last year while losing women by 9 points. The gender gap is much worse for Cuccinelli. In some polls, Cuccinelli trails McAuliffe among women by more than 20 points. That's a huge problem in a state where more than half of voters in 2012 were women, many of them from the moderate Washington suburbs. 2. Democrats are outspending Republicans . It doesn't happen often in campaigns, but Democrats have already won the money war in Virginia. It helps that McAuliffe is one of the Democratic Party's most prolific fundraisers, running in a state with porous campaign finance laws. He's collected more than $34 million this cycle, tapping a deep donor Rolodex dating back to the Bill Clinton years that includes media executive Haim Saban, California business maven Ron Burkle and Silicon Valley golden boy Sean Parker. Labor unions have also been generous contributors. Cuccinelli has collected much less this year, nearly $20 million. One reason for the smaller haul: A number of reliable Republican donors, anxious about Cuccinelli's social agenda, have held back their support. Some have even raised money for McAuliffe, including the Virginia homebuilder Dwight Schar, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman who supported McDonnell during his 2009 campaign. The same tale is true with outside groups. Liberal outfits such as the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood and NextGen Climate Action have ponied up big for McAuliffe, while their counterparts on the right have been far less generous. Democrats have vastly outspent Republicans on the television airwaves. Last week, McAuliffe and his Democratic allies outspent Cuccinelli and Republicans on TV by a four to one margin, according to a Democrat familiar with ad spending in the race. Cuccinelli has relied on the backing of the Republican Governors Association, one of the country's better-funded campaign committees, but its Democratic counterparts managed to keep pace. The RGA spent $8 million on the race, while the Democratic Governors Association put in $6.5 million, lending a crucial lifeline to the McAuliffe campaign earlier this year when their cash flow wasn't as hot. 3. Cuccinelli is betting on conservative turnout . The Cuccinelli campaign's slogan in the final weeks of the race might as well be ""independents be damned."" Trailing McAuliffe among independent voters by a 15-point margin, and doing even worse with women voters, Cuccinelli has spent the fall trying to stir the passions of the Republican base in hopes that fired-up conservatives could make up the difference a low turnout, nonpresidential election in which Democrats stay home. In the closing days, Cuccinelli is trying to turn the race into a referendum on the Affordable Care Act, a still-controversial law that's suffering from enrollment problems. But he's been trying to rally the right for weeks, giving interviews to conservative media outlets and bringing in an all-star team of Republican surrogates to join him on the campaign trail. Among the team players who've made the trip to Old Dominion: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Cuccinelli is also trying to bring libertarian voters back into the fold by campaigning with former Texas Rep. Ron Paul on Monday. A libertarian candidate, Robert Sarvis, has performed surprisingly well in the polls, and it's hurting Cuccinelli, whose crusading social conservative views don't exactly square with the limited-government crowd. Polls show Republicans slightly less supportive of Cuccinelli than Democrats are of McAuliffe. Cuccinelli's closing strategy is a fitting one. He captured the GOP nomination at a party convention in May, nominated by a small batch of the party's most hard-core conservative activists. Now he's counting on them to finish what they started. 4. The real action is down-ballot . With Democrats bullish on their chances at winning the governorship and the lieutenant governor's race -- in which Republicans nominated a long-shot candidate, the fiery former pastor E.W. Jackson -- close watchers of the campaign are eyeing the attorney general's race, shaping up to be Tuesday's only real toss-up. Democrats haven't swept all three statewide offices in Virginia since 1989, when L. Douglas Wilder became the nation's first African-American governor. It could happen again this year. The AG race is a dogfight between two state senators, Democrat Mark Herring and Republican Mark Obenshain, and outside groups have started to inject serious money into the campaign. In some ways, it's a proxy war between the National Rifle Association and New York City's anti-gun mayor, Michael Bloomberg. The NRA has funded a TV ad blitz accusing Herring of wanting to curtail gun rights, while a Bloomberg-backed super PAC, Independence USA, has come to Herring's defense with a $1 million ad campaign painting Obenshain as a conservative extremist. That's not all. On the GOP side, the Republican State Leadership Committee has pumped nearly $2 million into Obenshain's coffers. And the Democratic Party of Virginia, content with the state of play in the governor's race, has spent the final week of the race turning its guns on Obenshain in an effort highlight his conservative voting record in Richmond. 5. It's the Clintons' gateway back into politics . For almost two decades, McAuliffe has been one of Bill Clinton's dearest friends and most trusted advisers. The former president campaigned for McAuliffe in 2009, when he made an unsuccessful bid for the governor's mansion, so it's no surprise that he got involved again in 2013, hitting every corner of the commonwealth last week in a nine-city swing that drew enthusiastic crowds and generated boatloads of earned media. And Clinton wasn't shy about using the perch to point out a few of his accomplishments in the White House. Clinton cavalry rides into Virginia . But it's not just Bill: With McAuliffe looking sturdy in the polls down the stretch, the campaign provided Hillary Clinton with a low-risk way to ease back into campaign politics after spending the previous four years traveling the globe as secretary of state. With a possible 2016 presidential bid on the horizon, she made her first overtly political speech at a McAuliffe rally two weeks, drawing almost 600 people, many of them women, to a theater in northern Virginia. Her speech was vintage Hillary, more prose than poetry, but the appearance gave her a chance to get in front of a partisan crowd and test drive some potential campaign themes of her own. The Clintons have also used the Virginia race to get back in the fundraising game, hosting a number of closed-door finance events for McAuliffe and burnishing their relationships with the Democratic donor class in the process.","Democrats made Ken Cuccinelli's conservative views on women's issues a focus .

"London (CNN) -- According to the United Nations' mission in Iraq, 712 Iraqis were violently killed in April 2013. This is both normal and extraordinary. It is normal because it pales into comparison beside the monthly death toll in the worst years of the country's civil war. It is extraordinary because it is the highest such figure since that civil war subsided five years ago. Understanding the violence requires grasping three confluent trends: the increasingly authoritarian streak of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the rise of both peaceful and violent protest among Iraq's aggrieved Sunni minority (a fifth of the population), and, finally, a regional trend of worsening sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims. Each of these strands is tightly woven together. It was the invasion of Iraq a decade ago and the subsequent empowerment of its Shia majority that sparked fears of what Jordan's King Abdullah famously called a ""Shia crescent"" from Syria to Iran. Prime Minister al-Maliki spent his years of exile under Saddam in both those countries, and is widely seen as having aligned Iraq more closely to Iranian interests -- for instance, allowing Iranian over-flights of arms to the Assad regime. This diplomatic shift compounded a political one. Al-Maliki has undermined political institutions that were designed to be independent, such as the central bank and election commission. He has seized personal control of key army and intelligence units, many of them CIA-backed, including the 6,000-strong Iraqi Special Forces. Read more: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode . When the last American troops left Iraq at the end of 2011, al-Maliki pounced. Vice-President Tareq al-Hashemi, the most senior Sunni figure in the government, was forced to flee Iraq and was later sentenced to death. A year later in December 2012, hundreds of bodyguards and staff of Finance Minister Rafi al-Issawi, another senior Sunni, were arrested, triggering major protests. And on April 23, the situation worsened when Iraqi forces backed by helicopters killed dozens of peaceful Sunni protesters in the town of Hawijah. The town was seen by nearby Kurds as a conduit for suicide bombers, and the government claimed that the protesters were harboring militants from a Sunni militant group called the Naqshbandia Order. Maliki established a ministerial committee to look into the Hawijah episode and has made a few other concessions, but the damage was done: a previously peaceful movement has grown angrier and, in places, more violent. Taken together, Maliki's heavy-handed and sectarian actions have fanned flames that were never really extinguished. The result is a powerful sense of Sunni victimhood with many policies, such as de-Baathification (the removal of Saddam's party loyalists from positions of influence), seen as little more than collective punishment of Sunnis. The new wave of Iraqi protest embodies this trend. The protests are concentrated in Sunni-majority provinces. Protesters frequently excoriate Iran's influence in Iraqi politics and acclaim the Sunni-majority Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighting the neighboring Assad regime. Sometimes, their slogans are nakedly and belligerently sectarian. This naturally alienates many Iraqi Shias, who resent being associated with a foreign power and see the FSA as retrograde, Saudi-backed jihadists rather than freedom fighters. They are also likelier to see Maliki's various power-grabs as necessary steps to bring order and security to Iraq in the face of a growing regional and domestic threat from Sunni extremists such as al Qaeda and its ideological brethren. Iraq's increasingly autonomous Kurds, buoyed by potentially vast oil reserves, share some of these fears and sit in uneasy alliance with Shia political groups. Indeed, the Syrian civil war has widened Iraq's sectarian divisions and created a source of major instability. In March, around 50 Syrian soldiers who had fled into Iraq were ambushed and killed. The single most powerful Syrian rebel group, Jabhat al-Nusra, is an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq, and its personal and logistical networks run across the Syria-Iraq border. If al-Assad were to fall, this would have a catalytic effect on parts of Iraq, amplifying Sunni militancy and resulting in a flood of weapons of fighters across the border. Does this mean that Iraq is fated to return to the dark days of 2006-2007, when death squads were run in the heart of government and Baghdad faced waves of ethnic cleansing? It is important to note that while Iraq itself bleeds, the Iraqi state is strong. Al-Maliki is vulnerable in Sunni-majority areas where the Sunni militias of the al-Sahwa movement provide security, but his large and cohesive security forces serve as a buffer against wider chaos. Moreover, many Sunni groups are eager to keep the violence in check, having previously suffered greatly at the hands of al Qaeda in Iraq. It is certainly too early to talk about the country's break-up. Next year's parliamentary elections will be a pivotal moment. At the last elections in 2010, the Sunni-dominated but secular Iraqiya bloc won more seats but couldn't form a government, and eventually let Maliki take the top spot. This time round, it will be harder for Maliki to outmaneuver his political rivals: they have learnt that power sharing is a sham, and the Kurds are in a stronger position. In provincial elections held last month, Maliki's coalition saw its vote share decline, with many of his harder-line Shia Islamist rivals faring better. Another victory for Maliki under contested conditions would produce severe political instability, especially if present levels of violence continue. The imperative is for political accommodation, reconciliation, and compromise. Yet Maliki is unlikely to opt for this route as long as he feels he can keep his grip on power with the help of his swollen army, paramilitary, and intelligence apparatus. There is no obvious way out for Iraq. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shashank Joshi.","Monthly death toll has doubled in Iraq; now highest figure since end of war .

"(CNN) -- New York prosecutors dropped charges against one of two men arrested in a chaotic motorcycle chase that ended in the beating of SUV driver Alexian Lien. It started when his Range Rover collided with a motorcycle in a phalanx riding down a Manhattan highway on Sunday. Video, taken by a camera on the helmet of one of the many bikers who chased Lien as he sped away, shows bikers catching up with Lien's SUV and bashing its windows. This has brought bikers under intense scrutiny. But I'll say it: Motorbike enthusiasts, on the whole, get a bad rap. A minority of them cause trouble, sometimes a lot of trouble, which causes an undeserved prejudice against the majority. And that prejudice can subtly influence law enforcement, just as it can the public at large. Bikers have a rich history of misbehavior. In the most infamous case, the Rolling Stones hired the Hell's Angels to provide security at a concert in 1969 at Altamont, California. A member of the audience was killed by a gang member, reaffirming the bikers' reputation as thugs. Most bikers who tarnish motorcyclists' reputation commit far less dramatic and tragic acts. Riders do themselves no good when they remove the perfectly operational mufflers from their bike for maximum urban volume or pop wheelies in a downtown metropolis. At minimum, these riders are massively annoying, and at worst, they are very dangerous. Either way, the bias against many is caused by the few. The transgressions of a few bikers do not represent the true biker spirit, which is a celebrated part of Americana. Like the cowboys and horsemen of the frontier, riding the open road exemplifies the rugged individualist tradition of our country. But like many issues in society and law, often the actions of few negatively affect the policies applied to the rest of us. How important is bias? The arrest, and the almost immediate dropping of charges, demonstrate how fine the line is between ""criminal"" and ""victim"" in a police investigation. Bias works both ways. Have you noticed that every news story has mentioned ""Range Rover"" several times? What if the Range Rover was a Lamborghini? How about a 1980 Ford Pinto? Would that make the driver more sympathetic to you? Less sympathetic? Bias is intrinsically neither evil nor good. It just is. How fine is the line between victim and defendant? Consider how the law might apply to these facts: . First, in the video, a motorcyclist appears to deliberately slow down in front of the SUV, which then collides with the cycle. The law in most states presumptively holds the rear ending vehicle liable. If the driver in front makes a sudden stop, that can overcome this presumption. But in the case of rear enders, even defense attorneys will often concede liability, so it's certainly possible that a jury could find Lien completely at fault for an accident. Second, as bikers surround his vehicle, Lien speeds away. As he drives off, motorcyclist Jeremiah Mieses is run over in the chaos. Mieses remains hospitalized with two broken legs and spinal injuries and might be paralyzed for life. Those are very serious injuries under any civil standard or penal code. If it's proven that Lien ran over Mieses, he could be considered a ""fleeing felon."" New York, like other states, criminalizes leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident. In a case like this, in which someone is seriously injured, flight is a potential felony. So was Lien fleeing for his life, or was he a fleeing felon? Third, it's true that a lot of bikers gave chase. Was this alone permissible? In New York, a citizen acting on his own may use non-deadly force to prevent the escape of a person who has committed a crime. Lien's tires were slashed and his windows bashed in. Was that appropriate force? Those acts themselves are non-deadly. If so, were the bikers apprehending a fleeing criminal within the law? Finally, if any of the bikers charged claim they were justified in preventing the escape of a criminal, the burden is on the prosecution to disprove it and disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Police officers have the unenviable task of making snap judgments under chaotic circumstances. They're human, as is their process of assigning blame. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly says the investigation is continuing. More arrests on more serious charges may follow. Motorcyclist Christopher Cruz faces reckless driving charges after police say he was the one who slowed down in front of Lien's SUV and touched off the whole bloody encounter. Nobody has been charged yet in the actual beating that sent Lien to the hospital, but Cruz's attorney has told reporters that his client is not guilty. What would you do? Whoever is charged, you have this dilemma. Party No. 1, a young male member of a noisy biker rally carving up the West Side Highway vs Party No. 2, a 33-year-old dad out for a Sunday drive with his wife and baby. Who do you think gets the benefit of the doubt in a close call? That's bias. It's not intentional, and it's not categorically evil. It just is. But a lot of people don't realize that there's often a fine line between criminal and complaining witness in our criminal justice system. The proliferation of technology and video evidence has made investigations more objective, but it's unreasonable to think humans can cure themselves of all prejudice. Are bikers discriminated against unfairly? Maybe. But the alternative for them is taking up a less controversial pastime, and I don't see them trading their rides for golf clubs anytime soon.

"New York (CNN) -- A religious mural depicting two military servicemen was unveiled Sunday after 60 years hidden away. The painting was unveiled at the historic St. Peter's Chelsea church in Manhattan just in time for Veterans Day. In 1946, St. Peter's installed the painting by Ted Witonski, titled ""Our Lord Blessing a Soldier and a Sailor."" It features two men in uniform kneeling before Jesus. The congregation decided in 1954 to cover the painting because of its militaristic themes, according to a news release from the parish. Witonski ahd enlisted the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor and quickly rose to the rank of colonel during World War II, his son, Peter Witonski, told CNN. Back from the war, Witonski found a home at St. Peter's. ""He simply wanted to show that Americans won the war. And here they are, having won the war not going out and getting drunk but kneeling down and praying,"" Peter Witonski said. The decision to cover the painting came sometime after Witonski moved away, his son told CNN. Witonski had no idea that the painting was hidden under a curtain, his son added. ""I think he would have been hurt,"" Peter Witonski said. ""It was a labor of love. He did not charge money for it,"" Ted Witonski died in the 1970s at the age of 65, according to his son. Witonski produced a large body of art, and his work is exhibited by a number of prestigious institutions, according to his son. Witonski is not the only one that did not know about his mural being hidden; most of the current congregation was surprised by the announcement of the unveiling, said parishioner Jennifer Maguire. Once the congregation found out the painting exists, people started peaking under the curtain to glimpse it, said Maguire. Maguire, who has been attending St. Peter's for 16 years, only learned about the painting when she volunteered to help take a survey of the church's artwork. After some research, Maguire learned the painter was a respected artist. The interim pastor, Stephen Harding, told CNN that when he found out about the hidden work, he immediately thought to unveil it. Harding said he hopes that being able to see the work will give people an opportunity to think about the history of the parish and the nation. Peter Witonski told CNN he is looking forward to seeing the painting again after so much time. ""I feel that my father will be watching, somehow,"" he said.","Ted Witonski painted a mural for St. Peter's Chelsea in 1946 .

"(CNN) -- For 25 years the leadership of the environmental movement has told us that the solution to the climate crisis will be found almost entirely through the deployment of wind and solar power, accompanied by dramatic increases in energy efficiency. With coal continuing to outpace every other energy source in both its use and its rate of growth; with global CO2 now past 400ppm and rising at an accelerating rate; it's time to acknowledge that these solutions alone are simply not adequate to reduce CO2 emissions quickly enough to forestall disaster. Related: CO2 hits record level at key observatory . If something is not done to dramatically change the way in which humankind produces energy, we will bequeath to our children and grandchildren a planet that is almost beyond our ability to imagine; one in which climate issues will begin to overwhelm basic social and political cohesion. Related: Nuclear energy film overstates positives, underplays negatives . Indeed, as the recent reporting by Thomas Friedman of The New York Times suggests, this may already be underpinning some of the instability chaos we're seeing today in the Middle East. The stakes for us all could not possibly be higher. The dream of wind and solar powering our energy needs was a beautiful one, but it has also proven to be inadequate to the unfortunate realities of our time. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies from governments around the world, wind energy produces just 2.3% of global electricity; solar stands at an infinitesimal 0.4%. Meanwhile, global electricity growth averages around 3% annually, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's equivalent to adding another Brazil to the planet every year. This rate will likely accelerate as we transition to electric vehicles and begin to address the global fresh water crisis with energy intensive seawater desalination. There is another solution in sight, but today's environmental leadership either ignores it or continues, against the force of science and logic, to oppose it; that solution is advanced nuclear technology. The same industrial techniques that have been proven successful in reducing the costs of wind and solar -- and every other recent technological innovation -- could, if applied to nuclear energy, allow us to transition to a non-CO2 emitting world at the speed and scale that's required to avert a climate catastrophe. The French decarbonized almost all their electric grid in just 20 years using 1970s-era nuclear technology. They now enjoy some of the cheapest electricity and the cleanest air in Europe. Imagine what could be done today with a serious commitment and public support for a combined portfolio of both renewables and advanced nuclear energy? This is the position advocated by a growing number of environmentalists, myself included. The core objection to nuclear energy among many old-school environmentalists resides not so much in danger to human health -- which is dwarfed by mortality attributed to coal, gas and oil -- nor by the cost of the technology, but rather in a palpable fear of granting human civilization access to an abundant supply of energy -- in whatever form. Humanity, in this worldview, is a cancer ravaging the natural world that requires constraints governed by the laws of nature -- the ebb and flow of the wind and the sun and the conservation of scarce resources. It's a vision of a better world conjured up back in the mid-1970s as a response to the concerns of a very different era. When Dr. James Hansen helped bring climate change to the world's attention in 1988 (and then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the next year in an extraordinary speech to the United Nations), it was taken by much of the environmental movement not as a wake-up call, but as an example of how prescient they had been all along. It therefore never caused them to adjust their thinking to this very different reality. Herein can be found the origins of much of the political polarization and intransigence we now see exhibited by both the left and the right around the issues of climate and energy policy. Both sides share some of the blame for our current predicament. Human civilization today faces a stark set of new problems that are all converging simultaneously. At the very moment when our ever-increasing use of fossil fuels is causing the planet to heat up, we are on track to add another 2 billion people to the planet. At the same time, many more billions of people are lifting themselves out of poverty and exercising their right to live modern, energy intensive lives alongside those of us in the West, further exacerbating existing strains on energy, water and food resources. Meanwhile, technological advances in fossil fuel extraction have upended long-held assumptions about a looming shortage in supply, weakening the ability of all alternative sources of energy to compete without long-term public policy and market intervention. We will not solve these 21st-century problems with 20th-century thinking. Simple arithmetic will tell you that nuclear energy is essential to any viable way forward, if a climate disaster is to be averted. The romantic environmentalism that captures the imagination of so many well-intentioned people needs to give way to a more enlightened, pragmatic and less ideologically driven vision, one that's capable of addressing the daunting challenges of the current era.

The 28-year old's book, a murder mystery set on New Zealand's remote, forbidding West Coast during the 1860s gold rush and featuring seances, opium and a dead hermit, was described by the judges at the time it was shortlisted as a ""Kiwi Twin Peaks."" The chair of judges Robert Macfarlane said it was a ""dazzling work, luminous, vast"" and ""extraordinarily gripping."" ""The characters are in New Zealand to make and to gain -- the one thing that disrupts them is love,"" he said. He also praised the poise demonstrated by the young writer, who began the book aged 25 and completed it at the age of 27. ""Maturity is evident in every sentence, in the rhythms and balances. It is a novel of astonishing control."" Canada's Alice Munro, 'master' of short stories, wins Nobel Prize in literature . Accepting the award at London's Guildhall Tuesday, Catton joked about her 832-page book's length -- 160 pages longer than the previous longest winner of the prize. ""I've actually just had to buy a new handbag because my old handbag wasn't big enough to fit my book,"" she said, before thanking her publishers for allowing her to pursue her complex, lengthy ""publisher's nightmare"" by freeing her from commercial pressures. ""I was free throughout to concern myself with questions not of value, but of worth,"" she said. Catton is only the second New Zealander to win the prize, which is awarded each year for the best English-language novel published by a citizen of Britain, Ireland or a Commonwealth country, and carries a GBP50,000 (US$79,880) award. The previous winner was Keri Hulme for ""The Bone People"" in 1985, also set on New Zealand's West Coast. Canada can also lay claim to Catton, who was born in London, Ontario, where her father was completing a doctorate, and raised in Christchurch when the family returned to New Zealand. Catton said she had drawn inspiration for her novel from classics including ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" ""Crime and Punishment"" and ""Moby-Dick,"" and drawn heavily on archived newspapers of the period for her research.

""I was able to see how much everything cost; what kinds of foods and wares were available to buy and sell, what entertainments were on offer, and, most importantly ... read transcripts of actual court trials from the period,"" she said. ""The trials are extraordinarily vivid in their detail: I recall a man sentenced to death by hanging, shouting from the dock, 'I have in me three hearts and my father knows it.' That line gives me chills."" The previous youngest winner of the Booker was Ben Okri, who was 32 when he won for ""The Famished Road"" in 1991. Fergus Barrowman, New Zealand publisher of ""The Luminaries"" at Victoria University Press, said he realized on reading the manuscript he was dealing with a ""masterpiece -- a brilliant and brave and totally successful work of art. ""I knew it had the potential to go this far, but you never count the chickens in this game,"" he said. ""I think it will be a book that's read for decades to come."" He anticipated the win would help shine a spotlight on other New Zealand writers. ""It's certainly reminded people that the best new talent can come from anywhere in the world and often if it comes from a distant part of the world it's fresher and more exciting."" Hilary Mantel becomes first woman to win Booker Prize twice . The other shortlisted authors for the prize were Indian-American Jhumpa Lahiri for ""The Lowland,"" Irish writer Colm Toibin for ""The Testament of Mary,"" Zimbabwe's NoViolet Bulawayo for ""We Need New Names,"" British writer Jim Crace for ""Harvest"" and Canadian Ruth Ozeki for ""A Tale for the Time Being."" This year's award marked the last time that entry in the awards will be limited to certain nationalities, with the organizers' decision to open the awards to competition from any novel written in English and published in the United Kingdom -- opening the door to writers from the United States and further afield. The decision caused alarm among sections of the British literary world, with some expressing concern that the contest would come to be dominated by established American writers and lose its potential to highlight literary talent from around the world. But Catton said she welcomed the move. ""I think it's a really great thing that finally we've got a prize that is an English-language prize that doesn't make a distinction for writers who are writing from a particular country,"" she said. Previous winners of the prize include Salman Rushdie, Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwen, J.M. Coetzee, Kazuo Ishiguro and Peter Carey.

"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, anytime you sat down to watch a wedding movie, you had a good idea what you were going to get, whether it be ""Father of the Bride"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" All of that changed with the surprise box office success of ""Bridesmaids,"" a raucous, raunchy comedy that launched Kristen Wiig (and co-star Melissa McCarthy) into Hollywood's stratosphere. Fresh off the success of ""Identity Thief"" earlier this year, McCarthy is back again as an unconventional, unpredictable, anything-but-by-the-book police officer in ""The Heat,"" which reunites her with ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig. The film, in theaters on Friday, co-stars Sandra Bullock (who has done her own wedding movie, ""The Proposal""), and the two of them are an extremely rare thing to see on the big screen: two female cops. Over the years, we've seen any number of ""buddy cop"" movies (see the gallery above), but they've almost exclusively been about two men (""Training Day"" is even referenced by name in the movie). Once again, Feig and McCarthy are tweaking an established movie genre. CNN recently spoke with Feig about the new movie, and what genre he hopes to tackle next. CNN: What attracted you to the script? Feig: I wanted to do a follow-up to ""Bridesmaids"" in the same tone that allowed me to do the same style of comedy I wanted to do, and I wanted to work with funny women again. This thing just showed up at my house one day, a script was sent to me. It was called ""The Untitled Female Buddy Cop Comedy."" That's about as perfect as it gets! I'd always wanted to do action comedy. It just felt like the perfect mesh of the kind of movie I wanted to do, and getting to do it with funny women. I was reading it on a plane, laughing the whole time. I heard that Sandra Bullock was interested in one of the roles, which was exciting. I'd always wanted to work with her. The minute I started to read it, it was obvious the other role was so perfect for Melissa. It came together fast -- eight weeks after I read the script, we were shooting the movie. Box office battle: 'The Heat' vs. 'White House Down' CNN: So you had Melissa in mind right away? Feig: We tried to figure out something to do together after ""Bridesmaids."" I was really bummed when she got hired on ""Identity Thief."" I was sad because I wanted to make a movie with her that summer. Two weeks after she left to make ""Identity Thief,"" that script came in. I went into overdrive and called her people -- I had to make it happen. We actually jammed all her stuff with Sandra into a five or six week period, before she had to return to ""Mike and Molly."" Then we shot Sandra's solo stuff. Melissa had to fly back and forth the last three weeks to shoot with us. She was absolutely exhausted at the end, but you can't tell on screen. She just nailed it. CNN: How did Sandra fit into that dynamic on set? Feig: First of all, she's a great comedy fan and a talented actress -- having won an Oscar and all that. She hadn't done a lot of improv, and we like to play loose on our set. She got into it pretty quickly. In rehearsal and improv sessions with her and Melissa, we got to see her instincts for playing the character, and adjust the script so she slipped pretty easily into that character. This was like doing an exhibition match between two of the world's greatest tennis players, thinking: 'Wow, they don't miss,' wondering how long this can go on. I just sat on the set, saying: 'Wow, this is cool,' and got out of their way. CNN: You've done the teen show (Feig created the cult series ""Freaks and Geeks"") and the wedding movie, and now you have the buddy cop movie. Have you always tried to tweak established genres? Feig: I like familiar genres -- storytelling is really all about execution. I'm not a guy who's like, 'I want to come up with this amazing thing that no one's ever seen.' I like the comfort of a familiar story because then you can play within it and surprise people with the way you do it. CNN: What did you see in previous buddy cop films that you wanted to play with here? Feig: Katie (Dippold, the screenwriter) was originally inspired by movies like ""Running Scared,"" where these guys riding around with hot girls on the back of their mopeds -- thinking: 'That's not fair, why can't women have that kind of life?' At the same time, she wrote it from a woman's perspective. What I like is how germane it is to two women at a workplace. What we didn't want was a movie with two guys and saying: 'Let's put two women in here.' We didn't want women acting like guys. What drew me to this was two ultra-professional women who were good at their jobs and loved their jobs, and because of that, they haven't compromised in any other area of their life. So they need a friend -- I like stories about smart, professional women. My wife has at times struggled to find a true best female friend. The idea of trying to find a perfect friend is a pretty universal idea. Review: 'The Heat' CNN: Every so often, someone (most recently, Jerry Lewis) will make a statement that women cannot or should not do comedy. What do you say to that? Feig: It's the most ridiculous statement you can make in the world, about that. It's obviously made by people who don't hang out with funny women. All I've known in my life are women who make me laugh. Women very often make me laugh more than men. Women's comedy isn't as aggressive as a comedy of men -- which can be a lot of insults, put-downs and verbal punching of each other. That stuff's very funny -- ""This is the End"" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, I love that stuff. But it's just not where my skill set is -- I'm much more feminine in my comedic likes and dislikes. I had a lot of bullies growing up, and I was always running to my female friends and thinking let's just make each other laugh and ignore those guys . CNN: There was a recent controversy about a UK poster for the movie, which apparently Photoshopped Melissa McCarthy's image. Any thoughts on that? Feig: I have very little to do with the marketing and even less to do with the international marketing. It's a drag because I love Melissa the way she is, so that's the only way I ever want to see her. CNN: Will ""Freaks and Geeks"" or ""Bridesmaids"" fans see any familiar faces in ""The Heat?"" Feig: Tom Wilson, who played ""Coach Fredricks"" will pop up in the film and he's so great. ""Stove,"" the air marshal has a small cameo, which made me very happy. I really tried to stack this with people I've worked with. Zach Woods from ""The Office"" is there, and Tony Hale from ""Arrested Development"" has a very funny scene at the beginning. CNN: What's next for you? Feig: I wrote this female spy comedy, sort of a female James Bond thing that I'm putting together right now. I'm just trying to figure out who our cast is. I'm hoping that's the next thing I do, but I'm also developing more things. I've got a deal with Fox developing movies for them which is really exciting. Hopefully most of it will be with strong female leads because I love working with the funny ladies. I'll try to keep that up as much as I can.","After redefining the wedding movie with ""Bridesmaids,"" director Paul Feig is back with ""The Heat,"" a female buddy cop comedy .

"(WIRED) -- In less than a week, Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows, while Microsoft announced that Office 10 will include free, online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at Google's suite of web-based office applications. The fight between Microsoft and Google is over who'll be seen as the world's most important tech company. And not more than a month and a half ago, Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing, which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online. From the news of it, it's a full-blown tech battle, complete with behind-the-scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other. It is, however, not a death match -- it's more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology, since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon. Google pulled in $22 billion in revenue in 2008, 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web. Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses, charging $50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor, email and spreadsheet programs away. By contrast, Microsoft sold $14.3 billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months, making a profit of $9.3 billion. It made a further $16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems, which range from XP installations on netbooks, to Vista, to Windows Mobile to its server software. Google now plans its own range of operating systems, starting with Android, an open-source OS for small devices like smartphones, and Chrome OS, a browser-focused, open-source OS that will run on notebooks and desktops. Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them, or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money. In fact, they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example, Microsoft's behind-the-scenes campaign to scuttle last year's proposed Google-Yahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement. But in reality, the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside. And it's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world's most important technology company. Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend. Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids, and you have a Microsoft family. And though it is much joked about, Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types, whether they are making small business software, massive online role-playing games or photo-editing utilities. Google's ecosystem looks different. It starts with a Google Chrome browser (oddly running only on Windows) with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage. From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor. But most importantly, Google wants you to search and travel around the web, hitting web pages that run Google-served ads and Google tracking cookies. You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology, while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium. So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition? Browsers: Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market (depending on who is counting and how). That dominance remains, even though Microsoft's latest offering IE8 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities. Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years, but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind, despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced. Why does it matter? Well, IE installations come with a default home page, don't they? Google's Chrome browser, on the other hand, is a handsome, whiz-kid of a browser. It's sleek and nimble, and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled. The address bar is the search box (Google as default, naturally). Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files. The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes, the rest are unaffected. Meanwhile, lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser. Chrome also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share. Online Search: Google's name now means search to most users. Google's search engine means money to Google. In June, it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to U.S. web users. In the first three months of 2009, Google pulled in $5.2 billion in revenue, a majority of which came from AdWords, an auction-based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query. Microsoft recently debuted Bing, a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google. It's got some fine innovations, and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data, rather than just retrieving links. Still, despite these improvements, a $100 million ad campaign, and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog, Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft 8.2 percent of all searches. Operating Systems: Microsoft has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting MS-DOS and Windows NT, the frameworks that Windows have been built around. Microsoft is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world. By copying its competitors' best features, leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators, Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost 30 years. That's despite challenges from Digital Research, Apple and IBM. Microsoft's newest version, Windows 7, will be available in the fall. Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast, and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista, the successor to Windows XP. Microsoft also dominates in the business world, where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office. Microsoft is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices, which it first launched in 2000. Its OS advantages are immense. It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows. There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows. Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware. And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs. By contrast, Google first stepped into the OS game in 2007 when it announced its Android operating system for small devices. Google estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year. Last week, Google announced, but did not show off, a new OS to compete with Windows, dubbing it Chrome OS. That name signifies that Google's OS will be for the web and browser-based. It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser, instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples' OS X do. It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser, allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help. Advertising: Google is largely powered by its innovative auction-based text ads on its own site, but then expanded into serving ads on other people's sites with the Adsense program. It bought the ad-serving and behavioral-profiling giant Doubleclick in 2007 for more than $3 billion, and has ventured into mobile, print, radio and television ads. Microsoft has struggled to replicate Google's online advertising success. Despite owning MSN.com -- a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination -- Microsoft has not made money on the internet. To turbocharge its ad-delivery technology, it paid more than $6 billion in cash in 2007 for aQuantive, a full-service online advertising concern. Instead, Microsoft's online ad business lost $1.2 billion in 2008, double what it lost in 2007. The company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $3.2 billion it took in last year, but has not said it would make a profit. Contrary to what some might have you believe, the benefits of the Google-Microsoft competition are immense. Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories. Gmail's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular, though not user-friendly, web e-mail service. Google Maps led to Microsoft's Live Maps, which now bests Google's efforts in some ways. Google has been winning the fight for the last few years, showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest. But the pendulum may be slowing, or even poised to swing the other way. With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsoft's online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent, Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users: on the field of innovation. And that will make for an interesting race, no matter which horse you prefer to ride. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- The wife and son of an 85-year-old American being held in North Korea called for his release Monday, saying they need him back at the head of the table for Thanksgiving. Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, was pulled off a plane in Pyongyang. He has been detained ever since. His wife, Lee, said she would like to remind authorities in North Korea that Newman has been held for 30 days. ""We need to have Merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays. And we ask -- respectfully -- for them to release him and let him come home,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Asked what she would like to tell her husband, Lee Newman said simply: ""We're missing you, and we want you home."" Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, and it has been working through Sweden -- the U.S. protecting power in North Korea -- to obtain information about the American. ""We've had talks with the State Department, regular conversations since the detention. I think they've been working very hard to secure the release, to establish sufficient communications to get some feedback. But at this point, we don't think there's been any official feedback,"" said Newman's son, Jeff. ""The Swedish consulate, which would be the first touch point, hasn't had any contact with him and that's what we need to know -- if nothing else to just establish his well-being and the fact that he's getting his medication."" The family has said Newman suffers from a heart condition and only had enough medication for the trip. They have sent packages of medication but do not know whether he has received them. Newman, a Korean War veteran and retired financial consultant, was last seen aboard a flight from Pyongyang to Beijing. Just minutes before the plane was to depart, he was removed from the flight by North Korean authorities. According to his family, he had been on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea. From phone calls and postcards he sent, the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem, his son said. ""We just want nothing more than to have this misunderstanding put behind us,"" Jeff Newman told Blitzer. ""The right thing to do would be to put him on a plane and let him come back and join his family that loves him and misses him in California."" Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea. The other one, Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor. The North Korean government has said he was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. North Korea has not publicly said why it is holding Newman. Among the possibilities is his military service. He served as an Army infantry officer during the Korean War, which saw North Korea fight South Korea, the United States and the United Nations between 1950 and 1953. An armistice signed in 1953 ended the three-year war between North Korea and South Korea. The two sides technically remain at war. ""His time that he spent in the service was an important part of his life as a young man, and he was, I think, trying to put closure on that,"" said Newman's wife. ""He always has had an interest in the world, a respect for the Korean people, and he was looking forward to this as an opportunity to see the country -- for whatever opportunity he might have to see the people -- and to come back with a sense of comfort on having completed that circle."" It is also possible North Korean authorities mistook him for another Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat. North Korean authorities are known to routinely run background checks on foreigners, travel agencies warn potential visitors. News of the detention came as talks were under way between the United States and China, North Korea's closest ally, about reviving negotiations to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program. The timing raises questions about whether North Korea plans to use Newman as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, a move the West has previously accused it of using to try to gain concessions from negotiations.","Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, was pulled off a plane in Pyongyang .

"(CNN) -- San Antonio Spurs snatched Game One of the NBA Finals after a ""crazy play"" from Tony Parker gave Gregg Popovich's team a 92-88 win away to defending champion Miami Heat. The Frenchman's off-balance jump shot beat the shot clock by one-hundredth of a second to steal home court advantage from Miami. ""It was a crazy play. I thought I lost the ball three or four times,"" Parker told reporters after finishing with a game-high 21 points at the American Airlines arena. ""It didn't work out like I wanted it to. At the end I was just trying to get a shot up. I was happy it went in."" It was the Heat's LeBron James who tried, in vain, to stop Parker's buzzer-beater -- which landed with just 5.2 seconds left in regulation. ""Tony did everything wrong and did everything right in the same possession,"" said James. ""He stumbled two or three times, he fell over and when he fell over I was like OK, I am going to have to tie this ball up. ""He got up and went under my arm. I got a great contest ... it barely got off. That was the longest 24 seconds that I've been part of."" Miami had opportunities to make a winning start to the best-of-seven game series, but couldn't hold onto a three-point lead heading into the final quarter. ""We had our chances to win,"" added James. ""We had four turnovers in the fourth. We gave them some offensive rebounds in the fourth as well. We can't allow that."" Popovich said he tried to tell his players to keep their cool when they were under pressure. ""What we can do is continue to play defense, rebound and just hang and hang and hang,"" said the 64-year-old. ""It is a 48-minute game. In the NBA things go back and forth. The ability to move on to the next play is what's important if a team wants to be really good."" This year's finals are receiving global coverage, with live broadcasts in 215 countries in 47 different languages. There are also a record 10 players from outside of the United States playing in the series. The Heat will look to get off the mark in Game Two on Sunday, also in Miami.

"(CNN) -- Dimitar Berbatov scored a stunning hat-trick as Manchester United recovered from throwing away a two-goal lead to defeat Liverpool 3-2 in a thrilling English Premier League game at Old Trafford. The Bulgarian striker rose above the visiting defence with six minutes remaining to secure the three points after Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard had scored twice in six second-half minutes to haul his side back into the game. Berabatov had put United ahead with a header from a corner just before the interval and doubled the home side's advantage on the hour mark with a piece of brilliance -- bringing down a cross from Nani before executing a superb overhead volley that found the net via the underside of the crossbar. But Liverpool came back into the game just five minutes later, Gerrard scoring from the penalty spot after Fernando Torres had been fouled in the area by Johnny Evans. And the comeback looked to be complete when Gerrard netted from a direct free-kick that went straight through the Manchester United defensive wall. United threw away a two-goal lead at Everton last weekend and they looked to be heading the same way until Berbatov intervened to become the first Manchester United player since Stan Pearson in 1946 to score a hat-trick against Liverpool. The result puts United joint second with Arsenal in the table on 11 points, although the London side are ahead on goal difference. However, both those teams are four points behind champions Chelsea, who maintained their 100 per cent start to the season with a 4-0 home victory over newly-promoted Blackpool. All the goals came in the first half as Carlo Ancelotti's side ran riot. Salomon Kalou opened the scoring within two minutes after he was left unmarked at the far post from a corner. Florent Malouda tapped home the second, after Didier Drogba had beaten the visitors offside trap, and Drogba himself added a third with a deflected shot. Malouda added his second just before half-time but Blackpool's defence held firm after the break and Chelsea were unable to add to an impressive record of  21 goals in their opening five matches. Defending champions Chelsea lead the way with a maximum 12 points from four games and  they will be expected to increase their lead to four points later on Sunday when they entertain newly-promoted Blackpool. In the day's other match, Argentine striker Carlos Tevez scored one and created the other goal as Manchester City moved into fourth place in the table with a 2-0 win at struggling Wigan. Tevez opened the scoring before half-time when he took advantage of a poor header from Mohamed Diame to lob the ball over goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi. And more defensive uncertainty from the home side resulted in Tevez clipping over a cross for Yaya Toure to score his first City goal from close range.","Dimitar Berbatov scores a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Liverpool 3-2 .

"(CNN) -- After days of insisting no formal complaints had been made about a teen gang calling themselves the ""Roast Busters,"" New Zealand police now admit a 13-year-old girl made a rape allegation two years ago. The girl, now 15, told 3 News on Wednesday that police officers asked her to re-enact the alleged rape using dolls during a videotaped interview in 2011. ""It was traumatizing,"" she said. The teenager repeated claims she said she'd made to police that she'd been raped by three boys from the ""Roast Busters,"" a gang of teenagers whose online boasts about raping drunk underage girls caused outrage when they were exposed by local media this week. For days, police said they were powerless to arrest the boys because none of their alleged victims had filed a formal statement. However, on Wednesday, they admitted the girl had made a formal complaint just weeks after the alleged attack. ""An investigation was launched and the complaint was thoroughly investigated,"" police said. ""Whilst this was a distressing situation for the girl and her family, police determined that there was not sufficient evidence to bring a prosecution."" WaitematÃ¤ Police District Commander Superintendent Bill Searle told 3 News on Thursday the decision not to prosecute the girl's alleged attackers would be reviewed in coming days. He also said he'd be investigating why he wasn't told a formal complaint existed, adding there was a ""little bit of disagreement"" over what constituted a complaint. ""I was briefed there was no formal complaint. As far as I'm concerned what the lady said was a formal complaint. I'd like to apologize to her for any stress that this would have caused,"" he told 3 News. Opinion: Don't blame women's drinking for rape . He said he'd also be investigating the girl's claims she was asked a ""lot of questions"" about what she was wearing at the time of the attack. She said officers asked ""why did you go out in this skirt?"" ""It's not part of our policy, it's not part of our general practice to ask these sorts of questions,"" Searle said. The country's police minister Anne Tolley has asked the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) to investigate the matter, particularly officers' questioning of the then 13-year-old alleged rape victim. ""Parents of young girls need to have confidence that complaints to police about sexual assault are investigated thoroughly and appropriately,"" she said in a statement. Referring to the apparent confusion over whether a formal complaint had ever been filed, she said she was ""disappointed"" the full facts had not been divulged to her or the country's police commissioner. ""I don't expect to be told finer details of police operations. Police must remain independent of politicians. But I do expect police to be talking to each other,"" she said. In a statement on Thursday, Police Commissioner Peter Marshall welcomed the independent review and said Waitemata District police remained ""absolutely committed"" to pursuing the matter. ""Prosecuting these matters before the court requires a very high threshold, and we only get one opportunity to get it right. This means it absolutely critical for victims that we have the strongest case possible, backed by the appropriate evidence before we can proceed."" Earlier this week, Searle told CNN they had been actively monitoring the group since the first alleged offense was committed in 2011. He said police interviewed two boys identified as the group's ringleaders again on Monday, but they hadn't admitted to anything that constitutes a criminal offense. ""The online claims themselves are not enough to warrant a prosecution,"" Searle said. ""They might be morally inappropriate and unacceptable to us but we have to deal with evidence that would be admissible in a court of law and we haven't got to that stage yet."" Searle declined to confirm how many boys were involved in ""Roast Busters,"" but said the two ringleaders led a ""core group,"" as well as ""an associated group."" The boys were attending at least two different schools at the time the alleged offenses were committed but all have since graduated, he said. It's believed they're now around 17 to 18 years old. In a video posted to YouTube, two boys made no attempt to hide their faces as they told the camera: ""We don't choose the roast, the roast chooses us ... They know what we're like; they know what they're in for."" They boasted of their exploits on a number of social media sites, including Ask.fm and Twitter, as well as a Facebook page which has since been shut down. Searle said on Tuesday the boys had recently received death threats but had not requested police protection.","New Zealand police backtrack on earlier claims they'd received no formal complaints about ""Roast Busters""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will not be allowing new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico for at least seven years, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced Wednesday. The exploration of drilling possibilities in sensitive areas of the Arctic will proceed ""with utmost caution,"" he said. Obama's decision effectively reverses White House plans announced at the end of March to open the Gulf region -- along with other large swaths of U.S. coastal waters -- to oil and natural gas drilling. Under the plan, roughly two-thirds of available oil and gas resources in the eastern Gulf would have been opened to drilling. Areas located within 125 miles of the Florida coast would have remained off limits. Salazar said the seven-year ban is being imposed as a result of lessons learned from the April 20 explosion of BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf, which killed 11 people and triggered one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. An estimated 4.9 million barrels (206 million gallons) of oil gushed into the Gulf before the broken well, 5,000 feet below the surface, was capped. There is a broader recognition of the need for a more ""robust safety regime"" and additional environmental analysis in the Gulf, Salazar told reporters. He dismissed concerns that the decision will seriously damage efforts to further develop domestic energy resources, noting that roughly 29 million acres already under leases in the Gulf have not yet been developed. Rep. Ed Markey, one of the most vocal BP critics in Congress, said the announcement shows the White House ""has heeded the lessons of the BP disaster."" ""This plan will move America forward on a prudent path until we can ensure that when an oil company drills ultra-deep, it is ultra-safe,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said. ""Opening up wide swaths of our coasts to oil drilling before we put the proper regulatory measures in place would have been a mistake."" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said it is ""good the president is listening to the people of Florida."" The administration lifted a six-month moratorium on deep-water oil drilling in October. Salazar has argued that the moratorium provided time to make sure accidents similar to the BP disaster won't occur again, and that rig operators are prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios if they happen. Critics of the ban, including Republican leaders, Gulf state officials and Gulf Coast residents, said it only hurt oil and gas workers in hard-hit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster. Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican and a frequent critic of the Obama administration's handling of the Gulf spill, said in a statement, ""This announcement from the Obama administration today will undoubtedly send more economic capital and even more jobs overseas, in the wake of those oil rigs that already left our waters for Egypt, the Congo and Nigeria during the 'arbitrary and capricious' moratorium on deepwater drilling."" Environmental groups and other supporters of the moratorium argued that it was necessary due to a lack of effective regulation of deep-water drilling that allowed the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent spill to occur. CNN's Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","NEW: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal says ban will send ""more jobs overseas""

"(CNN) -- A preliminary investigation report into last month's Lion Air crash into the sea off Bali has called on the budget carrier to implement several safety and pilot training recommendations. The report by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee found the 24-year-old co-pilot, with 1,200 hours flying experience, could not see the runway upon approach and handed controls to the pilot at an altitude of 150 feet (45 meters) moments before the crash. The plane, a Boeing 737-800 manufactured in February and only used by Lion Air since March, was found to be airworthy and had only 142 hours of flying time. It missed the runway, landing on the sea just off Bali's international airport on April 13. The plane was carrying 101 passengers and seven flight crew. All were evacuated and four passengers were treated for serious injuries. The committee's report issued safety recommendations to the airline in order to ensure pilots were trained to follow correct procedure in handing over flight controls during critical moments and times. It also called on the airline to ""review the policy and procedures regarding the risk associated with changeover of control at critical altitudes or critical times."" The altitude at which the co-pilot handed control of the plane to his colleague was below the minimum altitude considered safe to continue final descent. The preliminary report did not indicate the exact cause of the crash, stating that the plane had maintained a constant course. The airline, which operates under the official name Lion Mentari, is banned from European airspace due to safety concerns, according to the European Union. Lion Air was a domestic airline virtually unknown outside of the archipelago nation of 6,000 inhabited islands until it struck two of the world's biggest ever aircraft orders. In late 2011, Boeing made its largest single aviation sale -- 230 planes totaling $21.7 billion -- to Lion Air. In March this year it inked a deal with Airbus for 234 planes, totaling $24 billion. Lion Air first took to the skies in 2000.","Preliminary report did not outline cause of the Bali crash .

"(CNN) -- A Japanese operator of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners said it suffered a ""minor"" setback while conducting a test flight of an aircraft this month. All Nippon Airways, the Japanese airline that is the largest operator of Boeing's beleaguered Dreamliner, said an electric distribution panel overheated and blackened during a 787 test flight recently. The May 4 test flight landed safely, and the cause of the ""minor"" incident was that a nut was not properly tightened during maintenance by Boeing workers, said Megumi Tezuka of All Nippon Airways. A Boeing spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of the event, which was resolved quickly as noted by ANA."" Both companies said the issue did not involve overheating lithium batteries, an issue that prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to ground all Dreamliners in January. Boeing has been working to retrofit the 50 Dreamliners it delivered before the grounding with a battery fix since January. ANA, the largest customer for the Dreamliner with 17 of the planes already delivered, announced this month it plans to return its fleet of Dreamliners to service on June 1. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Japanese company blames issue on Boeing .

"(CNN) -- Marin Cilic made a winning return to the ATP circuit Monday after serving a reduced doping ban. The 25-year-old Croatian completed a tight three set victory over Dutchman Igor Sijsling at the Paris Masters, prevailing 5-7 6-1 6-4 at Bercy Stadium. Cilic has slipped to World No.47 after testing positive for the stimulant nikethamide at the Munich Open in May. He was banned for nine months by an independent tribunal in September, but his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport saw his suspension cut to four months last Friday. The decision allowed Cilic to enter the final regular season tournament on the main tour in the French capital and he took full advantage. Despite losing the first set, Cilic earned a second round match against in form World No.5 Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina. He later admitted that he was pleased to put the experience behind him and return to action. ""I would definitely say it was the worst time of my life as a player,"" he told AFP. ""I have been on the tour for six, seven years, and have been always really careful and really honest and fair as much as I could with all the other players. ""And then to be in that kind of situation where when I found out about the positive test it was an extremely difficult situation where people were even calling me a doping player and a cheat. ""I knew I didn't cheat,"" added Cilic. World No.1 Rafael Nadal, who is playing in Paris for the first time in four years, told gathered reporters that he was delighted to see Cilic return to action. ""One thing I can say is I'm happy to see Marin back on tour. He's a good guy and a great player,"" he told AFP. ""I don't know what happened but if he's back, it's because it's fair that he's back. That's all. I'm happy for that."" Nadal will open his campaign later in week but the early headlines will surround players attempting to book their passages to the ATP World Tour Finals in London. Roger Federer, Swiss colleague Stanislas Wawrinka and French duo Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga are battling for the final three places in the elite eight-man field, with four others having mathematical chances of qualifying. Wawrinka learned his second round opponent in Paris as Spaniard Feliciano Lopez won a tight encounter against Australian qualifier Bernard Tomic 6-4 6-7 7-6 Monday. Federer, who needs one win to clinch a 12th consecutive appearance in the finals, will face the winner of the first round match between Kevin Anderson and Mikhail Zouzhny, while Gasquet and Tsonga could meet in the third round of their home event. World No.2 Novak Djokovic claimed the ATP finale last season, beating Federer in the final, while Nadal has never claimed the title. The Spaniard hopes to use a good performance in Paris as a springboard to success in London. ""The last tournament of the year is important,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. ""In 2010 I played well (lost in the final to Federer); the rest I played really bad. I want to try to change that. ""I was always motivated for this last part of the season, but I was not able to apply it well. I hope this year I can change that situation. I hope to play well here and then we'll see.""","Marin Cilic wins on return to ATP Tour after doping ban .

"Hura, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli riot police broke up a demonstration comprising more than 1,000 people who were protesting an Israeli Parliament plan to displace tens of thousands of Bedouin from southern Israel's Negev. Dozens of the protesters -- including a 12-year-old boy -- and a number of riot police were injured and dozens more were arrested. The protesters -- composed of Bedouin, Palestinians, Israeli and international activists -- were demonstrating against the Prawer Plan, which they say would displace the Negev's original inhabitants. According to Israeli sources, more than 40,000 Bedouins would be affected by this plan; Bedouin elders estimate the total at more than 70,000. If passed by the Knesset, the plan's implementation would destroy 35 ""unrecognized"" Arab Bedouin villages and displace Bedouin citizens of Israel from their historical lands in the Naqab, the Arabic name for the Negev, according to a posting on the website for Adalah, the legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel. A spokesperson for the Israeli Knesset did not immediately return a call. The demonstration here was one of 25 planned around the world -- including Jerusalem and Haifa, Washington and London. In the protests here, Israeli riot police -- some of them on horseback -- fired stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to disperse the protesters, most of whom appeared young. Some threw stones and bottles at the police and set tires afire. ""We are all here to say loudly and clearly that the Prawer Plan will not pass,"" Arab Knesset member Ahmad Tibi told CNN. ""Prawer is the plan to take out Palestinians -- the indigenous people -- from their land in the a Negev and bring instead Jewish settlers. ""We are Palestinians, we are the Arab minority here and asking to be treated equally. The Zionist point of view is to get rid of the Arabs and Palestinian from their land who are the original people in the first place and bring in Jewish settlers ... we will not accept that."" Amir Abu Quaidar, an organizer of Saturday's demonstration, said the protesters were seeking to pressure the Israeli government to withdraw its plan. ""We are here to give a clear message to the Israeli government that the Bedouin communities are Palestinian, and we see today protests all over the world, in Palestine, in the U.S., Europe, opposing this plan and to express solidarity with our Palestinian cause."" The Knesset passed in June a draft version of the Prewar Plan by a 43-40 vote and the measure could be finalized by the end of the year, the organizers said. The Prawer Plan would allow Israeli police to use force in its expulsion of Palestinian-Bedouin, they said in a news release. ""It will also permit the police to arrest and imprison any Palestinian-Bedouin up to two years for violating the law. The plan negates Palestinian-Bedouin ownership rights in their ancestral land, it gives Israel's Prime Minister unprecedented powers to implement the plan and it legitimizes the use of violence and coercion in the execution of the plan."" In addition, it said, the plan would expand Israeli presence at the expense of the indigenous Palestinian-Bedouin .","Dozens are injured, including a 12-year-old boy .

"(CNN) -- Move over, baseball, we have a new American pastime: analyzing the pregnant and postpartum bodies of women. To entertain the ""post-baby body"" headline hungry masses, we've standardized the sport of maternal shape evaluation into a fun competition called The Pregnancy Hunger Games! This ongoing pageant will encourage expecting and new mothers to not compromise when it comes to their sexiness. Good news, baby carriers: The biological process of making people does not have to lower your general hotness. The rules for Pregnancy Hunger Games are simple: . 1. You do not have permission to show for the first three months. Let's throw out the phrase ""Eating for two"" and replace it with the more accurate, ""Benefiting from lean proteins, for two."" 2. Do not gain weight in your face. 3. Do not gain weight in your arms. 4. After the first three months, you are permitted to rock a small honeydew melon-sized bump. How cute are you? This is not a rhetorical question or compliment. How cute you are is something you need to think about before leaving the house. Fitted empire dresses will help people realize that you're pregnant, not spiraling. 5. After the first six months you may upgrade to a medium sized, conservative, aesthetically respectful, perfectly round watermelon tummy. Wow, you're getting big.... 6. At seven months, please go into hiding, as you are making everyone uncomfortable. 7. After baby is born you must post an Instagram selfie featuring a makeup-free (ie. foundation, matte powder, earth-toned eyeliner and tinted lip gloss with a touch of blush) you and your new baby. A little cleavage never hurt anyone. Those newly banzoongaed mammaries aren't just for the baby -- they can easily take you from an 8.5 to a 9.25. 8. Emerge five weeks later with no signs of having given birth in single-digit-sized skinny jeans. 9. Burn your maternity clothes in the kitchen sink with an accelerant like nail polish remover to remove the temptation to backslide. The leader of the Pregnancy Hunger Games pack is currently Kate Middleton. The photos of her ""oopsie my shirt"" moment while playing volleyball shot her up to first place. We like Duchess Kate for being stylish, friendly, and down-to-earth but we love her for looking fabulous despite being a mother. In second place we have Maria Kang, the 32-year-old mom and fitness personality whose Facebook post recently sent the Internet into a frenzy. ""What's your excuse?"" she bravely asks mothers to consider. She's right. Think about it: Beyonce was back onstage wearing a sequined onesie just a few months after birthing Blue Ivy. Nobody was ready for that jelly, but we sure gobbled it up! More advice: stop eating jelly. Sugar. Model, mom, and reality show participant Kim Kardashian is raring for third place with her recent Instagram booty pictorial, but you regular moms have a chance at unseating her with your own smoldering bods if you're willing to put in the effort. Contestants: Once your baby has arrived, please take the necessary steps to preserve your sexiness to be considered for a trophy. Was your labor complicated? The good news is that C-sections heal! Ask your doctor whether or not the blade cut through your abdominal muscles. Relay this information to your trainer so that they can put together an accurate, gentle but also aggressive exercise plan. If you had a vaginal delivery, we expect more from you. Even if you experienced tearing, those down-there tissues should have healed within a few weeks. If they're taking longer, focus on your arms! Lift 5-pound weights to get ready for the evening-wear portion of the pageant. Being a good mother and loving partner is interesting, but we'll be evaluating how your shirt falls across your midsection, so avoid carbohydrates during your ""babymoon."" Hungry? Whether you're standing in front of the fridge or about to order in a restaurant ask yourself: WWGD (What Would Gwyneth Do?). Make the right choice. The right choice is lettuce and vinegar in case you're still confused. Breastfeeding is a fantastic way to nourish your young and passively burn calories. If you're having trouble, hire a lactation consultant. She can help you find the ideal latch to optimize the rate at which your baby sucks the fat out. Late-night feedings are also a wonderful time to bond with your baby and do some squats in the moonlight. Each time you get out of bed, engage your core. Now, juggling your little blessing along with a new diet and workout routine will be hard. It's OK if you feel like you're failing as long as those feelings don't affect your 24-karat smile, oh yeah CREST WHITESTRIPS, EVERYONE. Contestants, please report to your local weigh-in and submit your most recent notarized FULL-BODY* Facebook profile photo. During the elimination round we'll take your Body Mass Index to keep the judging scientific. Childcare will be provided. Good luck! *Nice try .

"(CNN) -- You may not know the name Douglas Trumbull, but you certainly know his very influential work. Trumbull is a special-effects giant. Among the movies that feature his magic are Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life."" His creation of Showscan, a hypervivid film process that combined large-format film with a high-speed frame rate, was a pioneering moment for film projection. Even though Showscan never caught on in Hollywood, it helped usher in similar technology used in the ""Back to the Future"" ride that Universal Studios ran for more than a decade at its U.S. theme parks. An inveterate inventor -- he says he believes he has ""23 or 24"" patents and even devised an appliance to fix the BP oil spill a couple years ago -- Trumbull has continued tinkering with image technology. Though he sold Showscan many years ago, he combined with its current owners to create ""Showscan Digital,"" a format that allows moving images to be shot at 120 frames per second (fps) -- five times as fast as the standard film speed of 24 fps. The high-rate images can be combined with those shot at the standard speed to offer particular detail to action scenes, which often blur images at 24 fps. Now Trumbull is trying, once again, to expand the capabilities of movies. He's in post-production on a short film to show off his new creation, a format that makes use of high frame rates, 4K digital detail, 3-D imagery and large screens to create a theatrical experience he describes, proudly, as ""substantially superior to IMAX."" (He knows IMAX -- he was an executive of the company when it merged with his special-effects shop.) Of course, Trumbull has been here before. He had similar hopes for Showscan, but was stymied when neither studios nor exhibitors wanted to make the investment in new equipment. In the digital age, he has hopes that there's a market for what he calls an ""immersive"" experience. CNN spoke to Trumbull in a phone interview earlier this week. The following is an edited version of our conversation: . CNN: What happened to Showscan? Trumbull: There's been a bit of confusion about Showscan. The basic problem was, it was film and it was 70 mm and it was a lot of it, so the negative cost was very high, the print costs were very high, and it also required conversion of the projectors and theaters and a lot of costs. I just couldn't get any traction in the theatrical movie industry to do it. CNN: So what's Showscan Digital? Trumbull: That's where the confusion has come up. When I talk about it, they think I'm talking about a revival of Showscan, which it is not. I was contacted by the people who own Showscan about three years ago and they asked: 'Is there anything we can do with Showscan that would be a digital version of it?' And I said I do have an idea for an invention that would be a method whereby you could change the frame rate on any pixel or any character or any object or any scene ... dynamically throughout any movie. So you could have a 24-frames-per-second movie but when the car explodes, it's 60 or 120. That turned out to be quite a unique idea, and we just did receive a patent on it ... and we got a patent under the rubric of Showscan Digital. I think it's becoming timely. Peter Jackson is a real big hero of mine because he had the nerve to make ""The Hobbit"" at 48 frames per second. CNN: That film's high frame-rate scenes looked like television to some critics. What went wrong? Trumbull: High frame rates do make what you want fantastical to look raw and video-like. I agree that that's a quality ""The Hobbit"" started to assume and a lot of people felt really uncomfortable with that. (But) I've seen the movie all ways -- I've seen it in 2D at 24 frames, I've seen it in 3D at 24 frames, and I've seen it in 3D at 48 frames. And because I'm so adapted to it, I really like the 48 frames. CNN: Do you think this is similar to when TV went to HD and they had to develop various new techniques? Trumbull: My take on it -- and I seem to be a complete lone wolf out there -- my belief over many years is if you want to make movies more realistic and more vivid, you have to think about the entire production differently. You have to write a script that's appropriate to that experience, and you have to start thinking about your movie as a first-person experience, and not the third-person experience of normal cinematic language. CNN: Do you think James Cameron achieved that with ""Avatar""? Trumbull: I think he got much closer. I think ""Avatar"" is much more appropriate to high frame rates because it's like a ride and it's futuristic, and vividness and sharp edges and clarity would be an asset. My personal feeling is that ultra-high frame rates and ultra-vivid giant screen movies can be like a window onto reality. And if you recognize it as such, you can write your screenplay, direct your movie, edit it and present it as a live experience -- not like a movie. That's what I'm doing it right now. CNN: Does subject matter concern you? When I think about ""2001,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Silent Running,"" your special effects have a sense of awe. And I find that a lot more powerful than I do watching cars blow up. Trumbull: The important aspect of ""2001"" is it's designed to be a first-person experience, very much of it. It's like (the computer) HAL's point of view. Kubrick wanted to get out of the way and not use traditional melodramatic production techniques. It's very much long shots that aren't much editorial intrusion. I think there's one that's 17 minutes long that's purely visual, with no dialogue, no suspense, nothing else, except the experience of you, the audience member, feeling like you're in space, going on this trip. That's first-person cinema. I don't think (Kubrick) ever anticipated or even expected that ""2001"" would play on television or make any sense whatsoever on television, because it really doesn't. It depends largely on the spectacle of the giant screen and the immersiveness of the giant 70mm medium. I think we're at a real transitional point where it's time to start thinking about the possibilities of making a motion-picture experience that's totally different from television, and much more immersive, and maybe not even compatible with it. If you want to get people to pay extra to go out to a theater, it's got to be a spectacular experience they can't get at home. CNN: What are your thoughts on the film format? Trumbull: I think film is great. I think film is not dead at all. I agree with some of the criticisms that people like Steven Soderbergh have. It's probably true that the major studios have fallen into a blockbuster-tentpole syndrome. The problem is that has completely crushed out any innovation or any cinema opportunities for independent or inventive or unusual, nonblockbuster content. That's pretty much left for television now. I think there's an incredible opportunity now to experiment with what I generally call ""hypercinema."" I feel because of the technical limitations in the exhibition business, the production values that (the studios are) paying for are not arriving at the audience's eyes. It's dim, the screens are small, the brightness is only 1/10 of what they see on television. And people unconsciously know that. You can look at your television or your computer and you'll see a really vivid, bright image, with tremendous color saturation, and it's always in focus and you can see it anywhere, anytime you want. IMAX has proved conclusively that audiences will pay more for a superior and more spectacular theatrical presentation. The problem is that all they're doing is blowing up conventional movies on to a larger screen. No one's still thinking about it as a different medium. I think it's a completely new thing. And I think the audience that pays for movies is completely ready for a new thing. When I was a kid, I used to see Cinerama movies and Todd-AO, and it was in the days we had what we used to call roadshows, when we'd have one spectacular Cinerama theater per town, not 50. At that time, even when ""2001"" first came out, there were only about 55 or 60 Cinerama theaters in the world. You'd have a period of time where a movie like ""2001"" would run for months or epic movies like ""Sound of Music"" would run for two years. And I think there's no reason to believe why you can't do that again by providing a truly spectacular experience. What if you had a new kind of a movie experience unlike you've anything you've seen before, and it's only running in one theater in each town or each region? I'm just interested in breaking the mold and doing something different, because I'm tired of the same old, same old.","Douglas Trumbull an influential special-effects artist .

"(CNN) -- Scandinavia's humanitarian generosity in the 1990s appears to have had some unintended, and unwelcome, consequences, as dozens of young ethnic Somalis living there have embraced jihad, returning to the Horn of Africa to join the al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab. Norway's Intelligence Agency PST is still investigating whether one of the attackers at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi had lived in Norway. The 23-year old had come to Norway with his family at the age of nine as a refugee, but according to Norwegian media had become unsettled after being unable to find work and begun to frequent jihadist websites. In a statement last week, the PST said it had not yet been determined whether the man took part in the attack, but added: ""Based on the information that we have uncovered this far in the investigation ... the suspicion of his involvement has been strengthened."" If it is confirmed, the Norwegian citizen will become the latest in a lengthening line of Somalis from Scandinavia who have either joined Al-Shabaab or planned terror attacks in their adopted homelands. He would also, like his compatriot Anders Breivik -- an anti-Muslim extremist who killed dozens at a youth camp at Utoya island near Oslo in 2011 -- have demonstrated just how deadly gun assaults on civilians can be. The Al-Shabaab commander known as Ikrima who was targeted by US Navy SEALs in an unsuccessful raid in Somalia earlier this month also spent several years in Norway. Kenyan counter-terrorism sources told CNN they suspected Ikrima had a hand in the Westgate attack and was connected to the suspected Norwegian gunman. Kenya mall attack video fuels army looting claims . Morten Storm, a Dane and former intelligence informant who penetrated Al-Shabaab and spent time with Ikrima, told CNN that Danish intelligence are particularly concerned about the threat of a Somali terrorist operative who works closely with Ikrimah called Abu Musab al Somali. Storm says Danish intelligence told him of their concern that al Somali was planning terrorist attacks inside Denmark after intercepting communications between him and militants there. Al Somali -- who also goes by the name Abu Muslim -- came to Denmark as a young refugee, was granted permanent resident status, and settled in Copenhagen. In 2005, al Somali travelled to Somalia where he joined other foreign fighters affiliated with the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamist militia that evolved into Al Shabaab. A year later al Somali travelled to Yemen to broker a weapons deal with al Qaeda, according to Storm. After serving about two years in jail al Somali returned to Somalia, where he joined Al-Shabaab. According to Storm, who exchanged messages with al Somali, he also worked closely with Jehad Serwan Mostafa, an American Shabaab operative wanted by the FBI, and Abdelkadir Warsame, a Somali Al-Shabaab operative who was arrested navigating the sea between Yemen and Somalia by the United States in 2011. Ikrima's name also featured in the trial of two Swedish Somalis who were arrested in 2010 after allegedly training with Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Swedish authorities accused them of planning to return to Somalia to carry out terrorist attacks. A phone intercept between a senior Al Shabaab figure in Somalia and one of those arrested was introduced during the trial. ""You should contact this brother -- his name is Ikrima,"" the senior figure said on the phone. After being convicted the pair were subsequently acquitted by an Appeals court, but it nevertheless noted the men were in contact with, and sympathetic to, Al-Shabaab. Analysts estimate there are several hundred committed Al-Shabaab supporters across Scandinavia. There are about 25,000 ethnic Somalis in Norway, 17,000 in Denmark and 44,000 in Sweden. The great majority arrived after Somalia collapsed as a state in 1991. Most have been grateful for sanctuary but a very small minority have become radicalized, especially among those who came to Europe as children. In one of the most bizarre cases, two teenage sisters of Somali origin left their home in Norway last week -- apparently headed to Syria. According to a Norwegian police statement: ""The family that reported the missing girls is deeply concerned by the purpose of the journey and fears they might have gone to Syria."" The Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang reported that the sisters, aged 16 and 19, left a message saying for their family saying Muslims in Syria were being ""attacked from all directions."" Among ethnic Somalis who have tried to carry out acts of terrorism in Scandinavia is Mohamed Geele, who first moved to Denmark in 1995 at the age of 12. Three years ago, he tried to murder Kurt Westergaard, the Danish cartoonist responsible in 2005 for a controversial depiction of the Prophet Mohammed. Police arrived minutes after Geele forced his way into Westergaard's house in Aarhus with an ax. Geele had already been under observation by Danish security services because of his suspected close links to Al-Shabaab. He is now serving a nine-year sentence for attempted murder. Of all al Qaeda's affiliates none has made more noise about the cartoons than Al-Shabaab. Some analysts believe that is because Scandinavian Somalis brought their anger over the issue with them when they travelled to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab. The group has explicitly threatened another Scandinavian cartoonist, Lars Vilks. In a 2011 video subtitled in English and Swedish, Abu Zaid Sweden -- a Swedish-Somali member of the group -- said: ""We will catch you wherever you are."" And he added: In whatever hole you are hiding -- know what awaits you -- as it will be nothing but this: slaughter,"" as he simulated slitting his throat. Michael Taarnby, one of Denmark's leading experts on Al-Shabaab, told CNN in 2011: ""Intelligence services have very little understanding of what's going on. Recruiting informants has been an uphill battle because Somalis don't trust them to protect them."" ""Those attracted are usually quite young -- there's the usual issue of a clash of cultures -- of being stuck between east Africa and Scandinavia and not knowing where they belong,"" Taarnby told CNN. Al-Shabaab has recruiters in several Western countries who try to persuade young Somalis to join the group in Somalia, and help them get there, according to Western counter-terrorism officials. There is also evidence that jihadists of non-Somali backgrounds in Scandinavia have gravitated toward Al-Shabaab. One reason is the increased mixing of Somali nationals with extremists of Arab and south Asian descent in hardline Salafi mosques across Scandinavia. Munir Awad, who is Lebanese-born but lived in Sweden, was one of four men convicted of a plotting a Mumbai-style attack against the offices of a Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, in 2010. The newspaper had printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed several years previously. Awad was suspected of having joined up with jihadist militants in Somalia in 2006 before fleeing the country, according to a Danish security source. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The numbers of militants traveling from Europe to Somalia is believed to have slowed in the last two years because of setbacks suffered by Al-Shabaab in Somalia, its internal power struggle, stories of mistreatment of Western recruits, and the magnetic pull of jihad in Syria. But Scandinavia's intelligence services remain concerned about a terror pipeline to, and from, east Africa.","Dozens of young ethnic Somalis living in Scandinavia have embraced jihad .

"(CNN) -- A front-row seat to potentially witness history Wednesday night at Fenway Park in Boston won't come cheap -- and neither will the tickets for standing-room-only. The last time the Boston Red Sox won a World Series at home, the team featured a 23-year-old ace pitcher named Babe Ruth, who won two games en route to a 4-2 series victory over the Chicago Cubs. That was 1918, the year in New England lore when the Sox supposedly fell under a curse that kept them from ever again winning the World Series. Though the Curse of the Bambino was finally vanquished with Boston's World Series title in 2004 -- and then for good measure in 2007 -- those victories came on the road, not at their Fenway Park home. So now, with only one more win to go, some fans are shelling out big bucks just for the chance to witness what they hope will be one final Fenway exorcism. The average price for a Game 6 ticket on online broker TiqIQ.com was $2,189 on Tuesday evening, while the cheapest available on StubHub.com was a standing-room-only ticket on the right field roof box for $983.75. One Craigslist posting offering ""CHEAP"" Game 6 tickets (in all caps, apparently to hammer home the bargain) led to a broker selling standing-room-only for $774. But the person who shelled out the most for America's pastime on StubHub didn't even come from America: A fan from Calgary paid a whopping $12,092 for a seat near home plate, according to StubHub spokeswoman Shannon Barbara. That's pretty staggering, considering the Red Sox paid Ruth less -- around $7,000 -- for the entire 1918 season, according to Baseball Almanac. The Red Sox lead the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 in in the best-of-seven series. If a seventh game is necessary, it would also be played at Fenway Park, so either way, a team donning red will be celebrating in Boston this week.","Canadian buyer pays more than $12k for seat near home plate at Fenway Park .

"(CNN) -- As recent high-profile attacks at major companies like Facebook and Apple, major publications like the New York Times and Washington Post and the U.S. government itself have made clear, cyber-crime is a very real and growing concern for everyone. The latest threat report from security firm McAfee highlights the need for vigilance on mobile devices and a change in how people and companies approach security. Smartphones and tablets are increasingly hot targets for cyber-criminals, and the volume of mobile threats is growing much faster than it did for PCs. The amount of malware detected by McAfee on the devices in 2012 was 44 times what it was the previous year. The company estimates that 95% of all mobile malware ever devised has been created in the past year alone, and the vast majority of that is made for the Android operating system. But McAfee's worldwide chief technology officer, Mike Fey, warns against looking at the the number of threats targeting Android and assuming that other platforms are safer. Criminals are targeting the operating system partially because it is so open, and also because they tend to focus on the platform they think will be around the longest. What makes these portable devices such juicy targets for criminals is that they are rife with personal and financial information. For example, many phones have banking features baked in, and criminals can use ""Trojan horse"" viruses to milk them dry using SMS services that charge per text. Malware isn't even the biggest issue for mobile users at the moment, says Fey. Phone owners should be more concerned about visiting a site that will do something malicious on their behalf. ""A huge amount of mischief on the Internet happens without anything being downloaded,"" said Fey. It's much easier to execute these kinds of scams on smartphones than on desktop computers. With small screens and pared-down mobile sites, cyber-criminals can create a legitimate-looking banking site and trick the person into entering personal information needed to access an account, such as an account number, password and mother's maiden name. Many intrusions begin in this type of simple way, often with a bad link in an e-mail or on a social network or a webpage that directs a person to a compromised or malicious site. ""There's a reason why those old-school attacks keep getting used,"" said Fey. ""They work."" The McAfee report found that the volume of suspicious URLs jumped significantly in late 2012, averaging 4.6 million a month. In addition to mimicking sites to phish for information, the links can download malware onto a mobile device. That software can send private data like passwords back to the attackers, or it can add the computer to a botnet -- a network of infected computers controlled by cyber-criminals. The software is downloaded so quickly that most people won't even notice. It's no longer the case that a computer will feel sluggish if there's malware installed, points out Fey. Decent malware won't even be noticeable. Apple and Facebook traced their recent breaches to similar incidents. Employees visited hacked sites for developers that installed malware on their machines. These hacks, along with Twitter's January breach that resulted in 250,000 user accounts possibly being compromised, were the work of Eastern European gangs searching for intellectual property or other information to resell, according to Bloomberg. A recent report from security company Mandiant described what it believed to be a powerful computer-hacking operation in Shanghai run by the Chinese military. This alleged high-tech espionage targets U.S. companies in an attempt to steal trade secrets. The issue is so serious that the U.S. government released an extensive report on Wednesday that includes instructions for corporations on how to improve their security. Regular people will not be immune to the problems plaguing corporations and governments, according to Fey. Once these weapons, such as malware, are out in the world, they spread. Attackers can steal the code written by one government and use it to go after other targets. While the origins of recent attacks have been grabbing headlines, Fey warns against turning all of our attention to the ""bad guys"" instead of the systemic security issues on the companies' side. ""It's not about who's attaching you, it's about the fact that you're vulnerable,"" said Fey. He said putting a face on the cyber-criminals ""makes it sound like you can go negotiate with an entity to stop them. That's never been the case with cyberattacks."" The current approach of discovering threats, then fighting them, has to change, according to Fey; he called it ""a thousand percent unsustainable."" New threats are popping up constantly, creating a never-ending game of security whack-a-mole. There are new highly sophisticated attacks that insert themselves below the operating system and can steal all a device's data before wiping it clean. Ransomware is on the rise, in which a criminal steals data or takes control of a computer or mobile device, only releasing their hold when they receive payment. A new attack called Blitzkrieg uses phishing schemes to install a Trojan, which monitors web traffic and scrapes banking information in order to transfer money out of the victims' accounts. In order to address all these threats, Fey said, the industry needs to rethink security from the ground up, designing more secure products from the start instead of just constantly chasing threats. ""We have to take some of the most complex security issues and simplify them into easy-to-solve problems,"" he said.","Latest McAfee threats report sees huge spike in mobile malware .

"(CNN) -- Alaskans and air travelers remained on alert Thursday due to the rumblings of a more than 8,000-foot volcano emitting a ""continuous ash, steam and gas cloud"" that already extends up to 60 miles away. The Alaska Volcano Observatory noted Thursday that the Pavlof volcano ""continues to erupt,"" with ""fire fountaining"" at its summit 8,261 feet above sea level. A resulting cloud that extends downwind 30 to 60 miles (50 to 100 kilometers) moved southeast on Thursday morning over the Gulf of Alaska. It reaches an altitude of about 20,000 feet above sea level. ""Satellite images show persistent elevated surface temperatures at the summit and on the northwest flank, commensurate with the summit fire fountaining and resulting lava flow,"" the observatory said in its Thursday update. A lava fountain, the U.S. Geological Survey explains, is ""a jet of lava sprayed into the air by the rapid formation and expansion of gas bubbles in molten rock."" It typically spews lava 10 to 100 meters up, though it sometimes goes as high as 500 meters. Remote but still connected to the Alaskan mainland, Pavlof is one of two volcanoes -- the other is named Cleveland -- that are on ""watch"" status due to heightened activity. They're also both under an orange code that relates to how their rumblings might affect planes flying over their summits. Both these alert levels are the second most serious out of four options, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. Less was known Thursday about Cleveland, which is on an island and not monitored with ground instruments like Pavlof. Two days ago, the observatory reported a 100-meter-wide swath of lava reaching about 1 mile down its southeastern flank. ""Cloudy conditions"" have made it difficult for satellites, and thus scientists, to assess its status over the last 24 hours. Even so, the observatory continues to warn that ""sudden explosions of blocks and ash are possible with little or no warning."" Five climbers killed in Philippines after deadly volcanic ash blast . A SIGMET, short for significant meteorological information, advisory from the National Weather Service remained in effect Thursday around the volcanoes. After ""eruptive activity"" last year at the Cleveland volcano, University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist Steve McNutt said 90% of air freight from Asia to Europe and North America flies over Alaska's airspace, and hundreds of flights fly through Anchorage's air space daily. ""We think of the Aleutian Islands as being remote and desolate,"" USGS scientist John Power told CNN earlier this week, ""but when you come up to 30,000 feet, we are talking about 20 to 30,000 people there every single day."" Power described Pavlof as ""one of the most historically active volcanoes in the Northern Hemisphere."" Cleveland is also ""very active,"" with its last large eruption in 2001.

"(CNN) -- Today we are issuing a cease and desist to all you gurus, ninjas and evangelists out there. And we don't mean the real ones. As you fire up your laptops and fuse your various essential electronic devices to your very flesh so as to never miss a fiber of the www, you will be forced to define yourself; to look within your black soul and come up with a paltry handful of words that converge to denote ""you."" Well, at this juncture, we humbly request that those words not be ""rock star."" In recent years, we have noticed an outright epidemic of cliched, narcissistic and, let's be honest, straight-up embarrassing self-monikerization. In short: A ton of people have started calling themselves ""visionaries"" on their websites, LinkedIn profiles, Twitter profiles, etc. -- and it's more than a little annoying. Nina Beckhardt, president and creative director of The Naming Group, blames this pompous proliferation on the fact that our identities are now more public than ever. ""Given that one's actual name (e.g., Joe Smith) doesn't communicate semantic meaning, that's what these types of titles are all about -- working to control that first impression,"" she says. Well, no one wants their first impression to be ""tool."" So ... some advice: . Don't be a cliche . Does your title -- ""Executive Engineer of Cross-Functional Branding,"" or whatever -- seem a little boring? Well, slapping ""ninja"" in front of it may seem like a quick fix -- if it weren't for the fact that there are tons of other people out there who had the same genius idea as you. Last year, LinkedIn tabulated how many ninjas were sneaking around the job-finding site and found it to be an extremely trendy title. To quote ""Fight Club"" -- which is also cliched, sorry -- ""You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake,"" you Java Script Ninja, you. You are merely one of huddled masses of gray-suited commuters suffering from Kurosawa-induced delusions of grandeur. If you do, in fact, feel impelled to flesh out your title with something descriptive, at least mull it over for a moment and come up with something original, like ""Martini Whisperer,"" of which there is only one on LinkedIn. Don't be confusing . Still, there is a downside to getting all Kandinsky with your title, like the Whisperer up there. We're guessing that the person in question is a bartender of some sort -- a fact that's not wholly explicit given the title of choice. Frankly, we just picture some sloshed dude conversing, sadly, with his olives. According to Krista Canfield, spokeswoman for LinkedIn, calling yourself a rock star or something of that nature online could have a downside when it comes to reaching potential employers. ""You always want to make sure that you're referencing words and phrases that people actually search for in order to make sure your profile appears in those results,"" she says. Let's say a potential employer is getting some internet assistance in hiring a photographer. Well, what do you think said potential employer is going to enter into the Monster.com search field? If you guessed, ""visual media rock star,"" well, then you would be wrong. ""When you're crafting your profile, think of the words and phrases you want to be associated with,"" Canfield says. Speaking of real rock stars, here's a relevant example of exacting nomenclature from the indie music world. This week, the band Yeasayer sent out an e-mail declaring that it had finally secured the Twitter handle @Yeasayer. Before, the band's handle had been @OddBlood, which was the title of its last album. According to the band manager, Jason Foster, another user had been sitting on the @Yeasayer handle for a while, and the band finally managed to wrest it out of that person's (we hope not cold, dead) hands. ""We did jump up like a thousand fans in one day,"" Foster says of the switch. Why? Because the band is now more accurately representing itself -- it's easier to find. So, yeah, unless you're toting a guitar case and cramming yourself into a sweaty tour bus every other month, we suggest leaving the term ""rock star"" out of your job title -- and even then, the whole ""star"" classification seems a little self-aggrandizing. Which leads us to our next point ... Don't be pompous . If you're calling yourself a ""universe shifter,"" it pretty much signals to said cosmos that you are not, in fact, anything of the kind. As Beckhardt says, ""Certain titles, like 'Evangelist' and 'Visionary' are just taking it a little too far. If you truly are a visionary, it will most likely show through in other ways. If Ghandi had a LinkedIn profile, I doubt he'd call himself 'Pre-eminent Ideological Leader.' "" So when setting out to ""find yourself"" in the sucking quagmire that is the Web, we suggest getting more creative with the manner in which you define yourself. Nix the slovenly shorthand and do the whole ""show, don't tell"" thing they teach you about in high school creative writing classes: Craft a homepage that shows your personality and demonstrates your skills (services like About.Me and Flavors.me make that idiot-proof), for example. Unless, you know, you are a ninja. In which case, carry on.","A ton of people have started calling themselves ""visionaries"" on their websites .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Dell, the world's number three PC maker, reported Thursday a 79% profit plunge for the first quarter of the year -- to just $130 million -- owing to a slump in desktop and laptop sales, so-called ""end-user computing"" products. Quarterly operating income for the division fell 65% year on year. ""In the PC industry, everyone is struggling -- not just Dell -- and especially in the mobile PC market,"" says Craig Stice, Senior Principal Analyst at U.S.-based Compute Platforms. ""When I look at those (Dell) revenues split between mobility and desktop, they're really not too far out of line with where the industry is at. The entire PC market struggled in Q1."" Technology research firm Gartner estimated 79 million PC shipments occurred in the first quarter of 2013 -- a fall of more than 11% year on year. HP saw a 24% drop in PC shipments, Dell fell 11% while Taiwan-based Acer Group fell nearly 30%. The fall in global PC shipments contrasted with a rise in tablet volumes, according to IDC, an IT market research firm. From January to March this year, Apple shipped nearly 20 million units to be the world's number one tablet maker; Samsung shipped nearly 9 million units for second place. The world's top five tablet computer companies shipped more than 49 million units to record 142% growth year on year. Dell has been trying to counter losses in its PC division by shifting to enterprise solutions, which includes hardware like computer servers, software for business applications and technical support to service clients. Dell's quarterly operating income for the enterprise division soared 71% to $79 million but contributed just 8% of the company's total income. ""Enterprise solutions are significant growth opportunities,"" says Stice. ""The margins are certainly better than the PC area -- high single digits to the low teens -- versus the enterprise space which is considerably higher."" In terms of hardware units sold for enterprise solutions, HP has traditionally been number one, with Dell and IBM rounding out the top three, adds Stice. Still, the future seems anything but bright for the PC industry despite a flurry of attempted innovations, from super-thin and light ultrabooks to convertible PCs that can morph into tablet forms. ""Dell was a bit slow to the Ultrabook game and lost to players like (Taiwan's) Asus and Acer,"" says Richard Lai, Editor-in-Chief of Engadget Chinese. In addition, Dell's dive into convertible laptops ""was rather half-hearted: poor screen, too bulky."" ""You can kind of say the PC industry is throwing darts at the board to see what sticks,"" says Stice. ""If they can find that combination of a whole computing performance PC, with mobility and a low price point to compete with some of those $200 media tablets, then I think there's opportunity. There's still an opportunity for a PC refresh cycle. That can happen.""","Dell says first quarter profits fall nearly 80% on slump in desktop, laptop sales .

"(CNN) -- David Wiles can't remember the first time he ever climbed a tree, but he does recall the first time he fell from one. ""I was about nine years old at a friend's party,"" says South African-born Wiles, 25. ""I was told, 'do not climb that tree,' and as a child you always know better,"" he smirks. That fall, however, was never enough to uproot Wiles' childhood fascination with hauling himself up tree trunks and clambering up branches. Nor did it prevent him from becoming a professional tree climber -- and embarking on a mission to reach the leafy summits of some of Africa's tallest specimens. Last January, Wiles, along with fellow tree climber Drew Bristow, launched an expedition of tree enthusiasts aiming to explore and officially document for the first time some of South Africa's greatest trees. ""I wanted to show Africa's beautiful trees to the world, bringing more awareness -- therefore protection -- to people who may not necessarily be interested in trees normally,"" says Wiles, co-founder of the ""Explore: The Ancient Trees of Africa"" project. ""It's all about celebrating trees, educating people and preserving for generations to come."" Record-breaking . Over 30 days, the team journeyed through the entire East coast and northern swathe of the country, covering more than 4,000 kilometers. Swinging like marionettes, the climbing troupe used tree-friendly ropes and motorized ascenders to scale some 20 magnificent trees, such as ancient baobabs, majestic yellowwoods and giant Saligna gum trees. Highlights of the expedition included ascending the world's biggest baobab -- a giant indigenous tree in the Limpopo province, boasting a 40-meter stem circumference at its peak (its size varies according to weather conditions, explains Wiles). ""Just watching the sun going down from the top of that tree was amazing,"" remembers Wiles. ""You are in the middle of nowhere and the only thing that you can hear around you is birds,"" he adds. ""It makes you feel so small and insignificant. It also humbles you as these trees have stood for hundreds of years, thousands in some cases. Your mind wonders what they have been silent witnesses to over the centuries."" Read this: Saving the majestic baobab tree . Wiles and his climbing partners also made history on January 26 when they scaled new heights by ascending for the first time what was measured to be the world's tallest planted tree: a giant eucalyptus in Limpopo which, at 81.5 meters, would tower above a 25-story building. But the vista from the lofty canopy, says Wiles, served as a ""very stark wake-up call"" to the extent of the human destruction of even the most pristine habitats. ""You look in one direction and you've got a beautiful forest and some of Africa's tallest trees,"" says Wiles. ""And then you turn 180 degrees and face backwards and there's nothing,"" he adds. ""It's a complete contrast; (the area has) been cleared out, they've cut literally all of the trees down -- that was quite sad."" Outstanding trees . South Africa has an exceptional heritage of spectacular trees, boasting a large diversity of more than 1,300 tree and shrub species, as well as more than 1,000 introduced species, according to Izak van der Merwe, a forestry scientist at the country's Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Yet illegal forestry, bushfires and industrial activities have had a big impact on some of South Africa's forests, threatening the country's rich biodiversity. In order to identify and safeguard its magnificent trees, the government launched in 2004 a project that gives special protected status to outstanding trees, based on their size and age as well as their historic, cultural and landscape value. So far, more than 70 trees and groups have been declared ""Champion Trees,"" a title that means they may not be cut, disturbed or damaged without prior license. Wiles, who was born in South Africa and grew up in Zimbabwe before moving to the UK as a teenager, approached the ""Champion Trees"" project before embarking on his expedition. The authorities asked him if he could help in officially recording the height of specific trees and Wiles proudly says that his project has added up to four trees to the Champion Tree list. Along the way, the team used mechanical ascenders to take non-climbers safely to the top of the amazing trees and experience the breathtaking vistas -- everyone from school children to national park rangers. ""This all goes to discovering and showcasing these amazing trees for people who will never see them themselves, as well as inspire some to go out and see them,"" says Wiles. What's next? In August, the team also helped to install treetop nest boxes for the endangered Cape Parrot, an endemic species of which less than 1,000 are thought to remain. ""Our skills as climbers allow us to see things no one has even seen before, and therefore offer vast research possibilities,"" explains Wiles, adding that the team is hoping to return to Limpopo as soon as possible to install further nests. ""We hope to gain more scientific backing into the Cape Parrots -- we are climbing arborists after all, not scientists -- and develop more knowledge and hopefully breeding pairs using the nest boxes successfully."" When asked if there is one specific tree that's on his bucket list, Wiles pauses for a moment, before declaring: ""The one we haven't found!"" He adds: ""I wouldn't say there is one particular tree because at the moment we've climbed the biggest and the most beautiful, but there is so much more; there is going to be something else out there that is going to blow me away, it's just a case of finding it -- there's always a search for the next big one.""","A group of professional tree climbers are on a mission to scale Africa's tallest trees .

"(CNN) -- A confluence of a hankering for fried chicken and hard times in the smuggling business means buckets of KFC are showing up on tables in Gaza. The idea to get the American fast-food staple into the hands of hungry Gazans came from al-Yamama, a food delivery service that opened in the Palestinian territory a few years ago, according to The Christian Science Monitor. When employees last month had a taste for some finger-lickin' good stuff, they called a friend just over the Gaza border in al-Arish, Egypt, and asked him to order some up. He did so and sent it to Gaza through one of the hundreds of tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border used to get goods into Gaza prohibited by Israeli restrictions, things such as weapons and cars. The transfer of fried chicken from Egypt to Gaza took three hours, not exactly fast food, but good enough for a territory where there are no Western fast-food franchises, according to the Monitor report. Their appetites sated, ""We asked ourselves, 'Why don't we provide this service for Gazans?' "" Mohammed al-Madani, the financial manager of al-Yamama, told the Monitor. Besides satisfying the cravings for chicken, the underground not-so-fast food service proves a point, Khalil Efrangi, an entrepreneur who started al-Yamama, told The New York Times. ""I accepted this challenge to prove that Gazans can be resilient despite the restrictions,"" the Times quoted him as saying. For the tunnel operators, fast food may help out with hard economic times. Israel has relaxed its embargo on Gaza, so more goods are getting through legitimately. And Egypt cracked down on the tunnels after 16 of its soldiers were killed in a raid on them last year, the Monitor reported. So lower demand means lower prices. ""Bringing some meals like these would cost $200 or more three years ago, but now they don't even cost $20,"" tunnel operator Abu Iyad told the Monitor. A bucket of chicken goes for about $30 in Gaza, about three times the price in Egypt, according to the media reports. Besides the chicken, fries, coleslaw and apple pie are available, according to the Times. Al-Yamama promotes the service on its Facebook page and usually makes the runs under the border when it can get 30 or so orders to make things worthwhile, the Times reported. And even if the chicken's a bit cold and the fries somewhat soggy, customers apparently aren't complaining. Eating KFC ""has been a dream,"" Rafat Shororo told the Monitor.

"(CNN) -- Some people think the only cure for the doldrums of winter is sunshine. Far from it. Why not up the ante? Don't suffer snow and ice at home when you can really do winter vacations and ice holidays in style. From snow villages to pyrotechnic-laced skiing theater to ice hotels built from blocks of the cold stuff, we've created a roundup of the best frozen getaways around the world. With vacation ideas in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, the snowbirder in you can express its inner penguin almost any time of year. The Harbin Ice Festival, China . Imagine a spectacular amusement park where all the buildings are made of ice. That's the Harbin Ice Festival in China, one of the world's largest winter festivals. Known for its bitter cold, Harbin was once a small fishing town on the banks of the river Songhua that has grown into one of the largest cities in Northeast China. The Manchurian city has a diverse history, mixing Russian and Korean influences. The festival begins in December and runs through the end of February. ""It was as weird and wonderful as it sounds. Big replicas of famous buildings from around the world. Working restaurants and hotels and shops made of ice,"" said Tim Harper, a professor at CUNY and editor of the CUNY Journalism Press, who visited the Harbin Ice Festival in 2005..""All sorts of ice art and games. And thousands of people wandering in couples or small groups, nearly all smiling and eating frozen fruit on a stick."" Icehotel, Sweden . Now in its 23rd incarnation, Sweden's Icehotel is the longest running hotel of its kind in the world, with 50 rooms. There is even a chapel so couples can plan an icy wedding and stay overnight with their guests. About 140 weddings and 20 christenings take place there, according to spokeswoman Beatrice Karlsson. Located 200 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle near the Torne River, the hotel in Jukkasjärvi is the largest in the world made entirely out of natural ice and snow from the Torne River, Karlsson said. ""Also, it is one of the best places in the world to discover the Northern Lights, with offerings like Northern Lights flights and nightly bus excursions ensuring the best possible chances of catching the phenomena during a stay with us."" Rooms are a chic mix of glassy ice furniture, fur throws and ornate ice chandeliers. Even with frozen water as its building blocks, the indoor temperature remains roughly 5 to 7 degrees Celsius, or in the low 40s Fahrenheit. The Icehotel this season opened on December 7 and will close approximately mid-April. The Hannibal Festival, Sölden, Austria . Elephants on ice? Sounds crazy, but this festival is based on the ancient invasion of Roman Italy by Carthaginian military leader Hannibal, who marched three-dozen African elephants and some 60,000 soldiers across the Alps about 200 years B.C. Animal lovers have no need to despair, the elephants are represented by snow grooming machines, and acrobatic skiers perform as warriors. This year's glacier theater will be held on April 12 and is expected to attract about 7,000 viewers. ""The Hannibal spectacle is unique in the Alps,"" with more than 500 artists performing on a huge natural stage, said Sarah Ennemoser of the Ötztal Valley tourism office. ""Crazy things are going to happen, from base jumpers, helicopters, artificial avalanches, fireworks, snowcats, monumental music."" The spectacle is held at night, at an altitude of 3,000 meters. If you can't get to the festival, this region of Austria, the Ötztal Valley of Tyrol, near Innsbruck, has some of Europe's best skiing. Ski by day and dance by night, too, with the Electric Mountain Festival international DJ event, going on through March. Tierra del Fuego . Many travelers think of South America as sultry, with images of Rio de Janeiro's carnival and the Amazon burned into the mind.The deepest south in South America is anything but, however. A wild, unspoiled region of ice-covered mountains, glaciers and the frozen tundra of endless Patagonia, which stretches between Chile and Argentina. One of the most comfortable ways to see this region is through Cruceros Australis, a cruise company operating in Southern Chile's Tierra del Fuego and around Cape Horn and the Straight of Magellan, an area Charles Darwin passed through on his famous Beagle voyage. Passengers explore the scenery and the amazing wildlife, from penguins to sea lions to whales, on at least two mini-expeditions a day in zodiacs, returning to the comfort of the ship to socialize over a glass of Chilean wine or scotch served over 40,000-year-old glacier ice. Ships sail during South America's warm season, running roughly from the end of September through the end of March. If you can't get to Chile during the warm season, head there during South America's winter to ski at Portillo in the Chilean Andes, about two hours from Santiago. Polar bear watching, Churchill, Hudson Bay, Manitoba . Who doesn't love polar bears? Truth is, global warming means within the next few decades the world's polar bear population is expected to rapidly plummet. With an environmentally mindful operator, you can see polar bears live in Churchill, on the Hudson Bay in Manitoba Province, Canada. ""I think people are very aware of the fact that it is a shrinking population,"" and this is driving increasing numbers of tourists to pay visits to the region, said Katherine Foxcraft, the product manager for Fresh Tracks Canada, a travel company that works with Churchill's polar bear specialists. The best polar bear viewing is generally in October and November, as Hudson Bay begins to freeze and bears take to the ice for hunting. Some outfitters have vehicles with protected viewing platforms to allow photographers to safely take close shots of bears who might even try to climb aboard. Other companies have remote lodges in the middle of bear territory. ""The bears come all the way up to the fence,"" of the lodges, said Foxcraft. Bears can be as curious about visitors as visitors are about them and do wander into Churchill itself, a potential danger. An interesting quirk of the town is that most cars are unlocked, allowing an easy escape from approaching polar bears. They might look cute, but they're still bears. Winter festivities in Quebec . The Great White North becomes a French-kissed winter wonderland in Quebec Province, Canada. Carnaval de Quebec is one of the oldest of the world's winter festivals, with its 2013 edition, the 59th, running from February 1 to 17. There's everything from dance events to ice sculpture contests. If that's not enough winter for you, head to Montreal's winter festival, expected to attract more than 900,000 people this year. Called Montreal en Lumiere, or Montreal in Lights, it will run this year from February 21 to March 3. Activities range from cuisine to music and other forms of entertainment. Montreal is also paying homage to a nearby U.S. cultural capital this year with a ""New York on Ice"" Snow Village. Stay overnight in all that icy goodness in the village's 25-room ice hotel, which has meeting rooms for events and boasts the 100-seat Pommery Ice Restaurant. Alaskan ice fishing . The thrill of Alaska's wild frontier combined with the pleasure of fishing is what Fishtale River Guides offers outdoor enthusiasts, . The outfitter, run by Andy Couch, takes visitors fishing throughout the year. Most of their ice fishing takes place in Mat-Su Valley about 40 miles north of Anchorage. ""Our ice fishing season is only constrained by ice conditions. We can usually safely fish starting in late November around Thanksgiving Day,"" Couch said. This year ice fishing trips started much earlier in November, but a very warm season may mean waiting to ice fish until late in December, he said. The season usually lasts into late March or early April. The thrill of fishing here has both to do with the size and quantity of the catch. ""The largest landlocked salmon we caught on an ice fishing trip was likely about 16 inches. In the summertime, the largest king salmon taken by my guests have weighed in at 56 pounds."" Most of the tour participants are locals from Anchorage, making it a great way to get to know Alaska. Beyond fishing, there is nearby skiing, dog sledding and snowmobile tours, as well as airplane flights to see the wilderness. Antarctica . If you really want ice, there's no place like Antarctica, the frozen continent. It's perhaps the most otherworldly experience a traveler can have while still on Earth. Oceanwide Expeditions, a Dutch company with an office in Houston, has trips that pass from Ushuaia in Argentina's most southern Patagonia. Their Atlantic Odyssey cruise is the ultimate in ice vacations, lasting nearly 40 days, with visits to the Antarctic peninsula, the South Shetland Islands, South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands. The trip also includes visits to slightly warmer and equally exotic islands such as Tristan da Cunha, St. Helena, Ascension Island and Cape Verde. Antarctica is rich in wildlife, from whales to sea lions to Emperor penguins and many other species of birds. Zodiac boats allow for passengers to get close to the animals, with expert guides explaining the wildlife. Trips alight on various islands and also the Antarctic Peninsula to visit research stations run by different countries, giving a sense of the island's recent human history and the fragility of our hold on this most remote part of the world, beautiful and full of thrilling danger all at once. Expeditions run during the Southern Hemisphere summer, from approximately November to April. The experience can be life changing, said sales manager Florian Piper. ""Our passengers experience and learn about the fragile nature of the polar regions. They become ambassadors for life.""","Sunshine isn't the only cure for winter blues .

"(CNN) -- The multi-state Powerball jackpot has risen to $600 million, with a cash value of $376.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. The jackpot marks the second-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history, after no one matched the winning numbers in Wednesday night's draw. Wednesday's jackpot in the multistate lottery was $360 million. The numbers were 2, 11, 26, 34 and 41 with a Powerball of 32. Saturday's jackpot will be the largest in the history of the Powerball game, surpassing a $587.6 million jackpot that was split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split by three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. That mark will be dwarfed if no one wins the Powerball jackpot Saturday. If that happens, the jackpot will be about $925 million for Wednesday's drawing, according to Kelly Cripe, spokeswoman for the Texas Lottery, which is part of the multi-state lotteries. The Powerball game is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs $2, and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510. And if that's a little too pricey for you, a Mega Millions ticket will cost you only $1. The jackpot for Friday's Mega Millions drawing will be at least $190 million, and the odds are almost the same, 1 in 175,711,536. Mega Millions is played in 42 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Jackpots in both games are based on payouts as annuities over 30 years. Players can choose a cash payout that will be less. Why you keep playing the lottery . But before you start dreaming of that mansion in Barbados, allow us to pour an icy bucket of mathematical reality over your head: You almost certainly aren't going to win. You stand a better chance of walking onto the golf course and hitting two consecutive holes in one than winning that jackpot. Here are a few unlikely scenarios that, we're sorry to say, are much more likely than you taking home this jackpot. From the Harvard School of Public Health: . -- Dying from a bee sting: 1 in 6.1 million. -- Dying from a lightning strike: 1 in 3 million. From U.S. Hole in One, which insures golf prizes for holes in one: . -- A golfer hitting a hole in one on consecutive par-3 holes: 1 in about 156 million. From a 2011 State Farm study on collisions between vehicles and deer: . -- Hitting a deer with a vehicle in Hawaii, the state where State Farm says deer-vehicle collisions are least likely: 1 in 6,267. From the National Weather Service: . -- Being struck by lightning over an 80-year lifetime: 1 in 10,000. From the Florida Museum of Natural History, based on U.S. beach injury statistics: . -- Drowning and other beach-related fatalities: 1 in 2 million. -- Being attacked by a shark: 1 in 11.5 million. That being said, some folks do snatch a jackpot from the jaws of improbability, one of them being Geneva, Illinois, resident Ricardo Cereza. Cereza recently yanked some old lottery tickets out of a cookie jar at his house. One of them turned out to be an Illinois Lottery ticket worth $4.8 million, CNN affiliate WGN reported. ""When I realized we had all six numbers, it was that shocking moment of, 'whoa, can this really be?'"" Cereza told the station. ""So I called my son over and asked him to double-check this, and he looks it through and goes, 'Yep, looks like a winner,'"" Cereza said. The family will use the winnings to pay off the mortgage on their home, which was facing foreclosure, according to WGN. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.","Powerball jackpot rises to $600 million, with cash value of $377 million .

"(CNN) -- Listening to the radio was something I did -- when I was a teenager. Just take my middle and high school years where every morning, at 6:55, I flipped on my Walkman and began the trudge down the hill to the bus stop. It was tuned to B94, which was Pittsburgh's ""Today's Hit Music"" station. Every day, the crazy -- and at that time seemingly raunchy -- antics of its morning show with John, Dave, Bubba and Shelly made me excited to be awake. Although the show offered really nothing of value to enrich my life, like a sugary drink, it didn't have to. In those 40 minutes on the bus, there was adequately funny banter (which in hindsight, was terrible), vital information of what happened in Hollywood overnight, and most importantly, today's hottest music. The Pussycat Dolls, then Natasha Bedingfield, and that one Fort Minor song? If I heard that lineup again, High School Me would probably melt in happiness. But my radio listening habits didn't end at 7:45 a.m. After school, I probably listened to the same set of music. The only difference was the afternoon slot felt like it was filled with endless commercials that didn't air in the morning. But it all stopped when I went to college. The pop music station in my new home, a small Ohio town, couldn't match the ""talents"" of John, Dave, Bubba and Shelly (although it was not like I was awake at 7 a.m. to listen). While I was slinking into my late teens, the playlist of that low-budget station felt like it was stuck in my middle-school years. By then, I was also hooked to my family's satellite radio account, which was like terrestrial radio without all of those terrible commercials for car dealerships or rug outlets. And discovering new music on the Internet around that time became easier. I trawled through iTunes' constantly updated charts. My friends posted recommendations on their Facebook and Twitter accounts, which substituted for radio stations plugging whatever artist their corporate parent suggested. Also, my dorm's high-speed Internet connection allowed me to stream music from noncommercial stations all around the world, like BBC Radio 1, to see what we would be listening to stateside in another six months. After college, I moved to Austin, Texas, a traffic-prone town where you would spend more time in your car than at your destination. But when I pulled into the city in 2012, I didn't even bother to reset my car's radio to the local stations. It wasn't necessary. Most if not all of the time, I was plugged into my satellite radio or my app-filled iPhone, which played a steady stream of commercial-free music catering to my tastes. For my friends and me, the car's auxiliary outlet killed the radio star. Now I'm 24 and the radio's relevancy is fading faster than driving out of a signal's reach. The Internet has made me an an ""on-demand"" listener, meaning I can listen to any song, from any artist, at any time. From music apps, websites (like Soundcloud), and the blogs, there are literally millions of sources to discover new music. I can listen to a new song seconds after it's released and not wait days, or even weeks, before the radio bothers to play it. And, ugh, those cheesy DJs are no longer polluting my listening experience with their allegedly wacky and zany gags. The definition of DJ has shifted from John, Dave, Bubba and Shelly, to actual, physical DJs, who spin ""records"" like Diplo or Avicii. It's not just me. Every morning, my wretched millennial friends awake to freshly brewed tunes from our favorite blogs. New music from my friends fills up my Spotify inbox at a seemingly never-ending pace (and vice versa). I would be scared to hear how loud the laugh would be if anyone asked if we'd discovered a half-decent new song on the radio in the past five years. I don't know even know what channel to find that on! Since the iPhone has replaced my Walkman, my friends have replaced the DJs, and the ability to listen to whatever I want at any given moment kicked out radio stations' playlists, I would say it's time to turn off the radio for good. But I already did that five years ago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jordan Valinsky.","Valinsky: I don't need AM/FM anymore .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Army lieutenant general has become the first woman in U.S. military history to get four stars. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody will command 133,000 personnel worldwide in the Army Material Command. The military on Friday promoted Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody, who has served in several command positions in her 33-year Army career. She will command Army Materiel Command, responsible for equipping, arming and outfitting soldiers. ""There is no one more surprised than I,"" she said of her promotion at a ceremony on Friday.  Watch: Gen. Dunwoody 'a beacon' for women » . She had planned on a two-year enlistment upon leaving college, she said, and planned on being a physical education teacher. Dunwoody, 55, hailed those who had helped her throughout her career and pledged to do the same for those she now leads. ""The Army nurtured me and mentored me, and today the Army offers me the chance to return the favor,"" she said. She'll command 133,000 personnel around the globe. ""She is recognized as one of the foremost military logisticians in her generation,"" said Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Dunwoody, a native of New York, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1975 after her graduation from the State University of New York in Cortland. She also holds graduate degrees in national resource strategy and logistics management. She became the Army's top-ranking woman in 2005 when she received her third star and became deputy chief of staff for Army logistics. Her promotion highlights the growing role of women in the U.S. military over the years. Fifty-seven active-duty women and 47 female reservists hold the rank of general or its Navy equivalent, according to the American Forces Press Service. The Pentagon has said that more than 193,400 women have deployed in support of U.S. operations since September 11, 2001 -- the day the United States was attacked by al Qaeda.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's nephew revealed Thursday that when he was molested as a child, Jackson ""was a support system for me and my mom."" Taj Jackson, 39, claimed he was a child sex abuse victim in a series of Twitter messages posted in response to Wade Robson's televised claim that Michael Jackson molested him. ""I will not let them smear my Uncle's legacy,"" he tweeted. Robson, a dancer who frequently visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch as a child, called Jackson ""a pedophile and a child sexual abuser"" in an interview Thursday on NBC's ""Today Show."" He said Jackson ""performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him"" from ages 7 to 14. Apparently Taj Jackson, one of three sons of Tito Jackson, posted a series of Twitter messages in defense of his uncle, Michael Jackson. ""I hate that Wade made me do this, this way,"" Taj Jackson tweeted. ""But since my uncle Michael is no longer here to defend himself. I will."" ""I am writing these words knowing that the minute I press send, my life will never be the same afterwards,"" he tweeted, before claiming in another tweet that he was sexually abused as a child by a relative. Michael Jackson ""was a support system for me and my mom,"" he tweeted. ""He wrote a letter to her that many have seen already, u just didn't know what it was about."" He posted a photo of that handwritten note from Michael Jackson to Taj's mother Dee Dee Jackson: . ""Dee Dee, Please read this article about child molestation and read it to Taj, T.J. and Taryll. It brings out how even your own relatives can be molesters of children, or even uncles or aunts molesting nephew or nieces. Please read. Love MJ."" It was his own childhood experience that qualified him to question Robson's accusations, he said. ""That is how I KNOW Wade is lying. Because I AM a survivor."" Robson, now 30, denied in testimony at Jackson's child molestation trial in 2005 that he had been molested by the singer. Jackson was acquitted, partly based on the testimony of Robson, his sister and his mother. Tom Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in the trial, said he was one of his strongest witnesses. Robson said Thursday that his denial was the result of Jackson's ""complete manipulation and brainwashing"" of him. ""Don't forget I was living at Neverland when Wade testified during my uncle's case,"" Taj Jackson tweeted. ""I sat there and ate dinner with him and his family."" Robson, who filed a creditor's claim against Jackson's estate this month, insisted in the NBC interview he was not now coming forward because of money. ""The idea that I would make all of this up and put myself, my wife, my son, my entire family through this extremely stressful and painful experience all for the sake of money is completely incomprehensible,"" he said. Taj Jackson's tweets challenged Robson's explanation. ""What people will $ay and do for money and to $tay relevant is $ickening. De$perate times call for De$perate mea$ures. I will not sit back and let someone flat out lie about my uncle. PERIOD."" ""I always told my uncle Michael that I would take a bullet for him,"" he tweeted. ""I mean it today just as much as I meant it back then."" Taj Jackson's brother T.J.

"(CNN) -- Eastern Canada got the shakes on Friday. Even the northern U.S. twitched. People on both sides of the border felt an earthquake originating around the Quebec and Ontario borders, the Canadian government said. Natural Resources Canada gave it a preliminary magnitude of 5.2; the U.S. Geological Survey put it at 4.4. With an epicenter about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Shawville, in western Quebec, the quake was felt in the Ottawa-Gatineau area and out to Toronto, more than 260 miles away. It hit a nerve in New York state and Cleveland, too. ""My house shook!"" Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said in a tweet. Authorities say it is unlikely the quake, which occurred at 9:43 a.m., caused significant damage. It was followed 10 minutes later by an aftershock measured at magnitude-4.1 by the Canadian agency and 3.6 by the U.S. bureau. Its epicenter was about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Shawville. ""It kind of made me a little nervous and I booted it out of the house as quick as I could. It certainly got my heart racing,"" said Jonathan Essiambre of Shawville, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. ""It was like a massive explosion that went off. It just started shaking and the walls of the bakery were moving,"" Dan Duggan, who owns a bakery in Shawville, said, according to the CBC. ""I thought it was my propane tanks exploding. We were evacuating employees out of the building. It lasted for about 25 seconds and it went on for about another minute."" ""We had a lot of shaking, that's for sure,"" said Kim Bulmer, town clerk of nearby Renfrew, Ontario. ""But I just checked with the public works director, and there does not seem to be any reports of damage so far."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said state emergency officials were monitoring the quake, felt in parts of the state.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 20 insurgents were killed Friday as Nigeria's military carried out an aerial bombardment of suspected militant Islamist camps in the country's northeast, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. The raid by Nigerian Air Force jets and attack helicopters is part of what the military says is a ""massive deployment"" of forces this week to tackle insurgent groups, including Boko Haram. 'Massive' numbers of Nigerian troops target insurgents . ""Our military has overrun a number of the militants' camps in north and central Borno state,"" said defense spokesman Brig. Gen. Chris Olukolade. ""Within those insurgents' camps, we discovered that they have been storing sophisticated, high-caliber weapons including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons."" Asked whether the military had inflicted any casualties on the insurgents, Olukolade said, ""definitely so. Conservatively speaking, over 20 dead so far."" Members of the armed forces have suffered only minor injuries, according to Olukolade. ""The operation continues, we are injecting even more troops and resources into those areas,"" he added. The military operation was announced Wednesday, a day after President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states. The president blamed ""terrorists"" aimed at ""rebellion,"" causing ""fear among our citizens and a near breakdown of law and order in parts of the country."" He also noted a rise of insurgent violence in eight other states, including Nasarawa, where scores of police officers were killed last week. ""Insurgents and terrorists,"" including Boko Haram, are trying to destabilize Nigeria, Jonathan said. ""The military operation will focus on tracking down criminal elements within the vicinity of border communities prone to terrorist activities,"" Olukolade said Wednesday. He did not confirm the number of troops deployed or which units are involved in the military operation. Much violence over recent years has been blamed on Boko Haram, the name of which means ""Western education is sacrilege."" On Friday, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights commissioner told reporters that Boko Haram could face war crimes charges for alleged ethnic and religious cleansing in Nigeria. Addressing reporters in Geneva, Rupert Colville urged it and other extremist groups to stop ""cowardly attacks"" against civilians, security forces, Nigerian officials and foreign nationals. According to Human Rights Watch, the group has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria. The U.N. human rights office is calling on Nigeria's government to respect human rights principles during security sweeps, following reports of heavy casualties in some parts of the country. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, with a population of nearly 175 million according to the CIA World Factbook, and is the political and economic powerhouse of West Africa. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Boko Haram could face war crimes charges for ethnic cleansing, U.N. official says .

"(CNN) -- There is a phrase that has long been used in certain big-city political circles. It has always been said with an implied -- and sometimes literal -- sneer: . ""They think it's on the legit."" It refers to people who are trusting by nature -- occasionally novice political adversaries, often the general public -- and who make the mistake of actually believing a proposal that is being presented to them. People who, hearing a promise, take it on faith. ""They think it's on the legit."" Meaning: . ""Suckers."" This is Thanksgiving week. For all the heated talk about, and blame-placing over, the deeply troubled federal health care initiative -- for those who blame President Barack Obama and the Democrats for the screwed-up rollout, for those who blame the Republicans for their longstanding opposition to the White House plan and their determination to combat it at every turn, for those who are furious that the early pledge about being able to keep current insurance was not real, for those who take delight that the website has been a disaster because it makes one side come off as incompetent -- this may be a good moment to step back and think, with real-life compassion, about what sometimes gets lost in the partisan back-and-forth. To think about the people who don't care much about Beltway haggling, but who desperately need dependable health care for their families, and who were hoping against hope that readily available medical care was at last going to be theirs. The people who heard the promises. They thought it was on the legit. At base, this isn't -- or should not be -- a matter of politics, of Washington winners and losers. The families to whom reliable health care has been an unattainable dream don't care which party finds a way to that health care for them. And both parties, at least in their public statements, agree that while they might not concur at all on the method of getting there, they concur on the goal. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida: ""As policymakers, we must focus on making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans."" Let the ideologues on both ends of the right-left continuum make a game of this, if they wish. But do you think, when a person with a sick child finds a doctor who will help and who will bring peace of mind, the parent cares whether the physician is a Republican or a Democrat? The same goes for how a person in such need would feel about a member of Congress who helped him or her find a path to decent care. For those among us fortunate enough to have doctors we can go to, and the means to pay for them, this Thanksgiving week is a time to remind ourselves how grateful we should feel to be in such a position. Because it is only when you're not in that position -- when you are sick and have nowhere to turn, or, worse, when it is your son or daughter who is sick and you have to explain that you have nowhere to turn -- that you fully understand the fear and helplessness that kicks in in the middle of the night. Come October 1, the people who yearned for a way to take care of their families' health were told, such a way will be yours. Well-to-do people are always going to have more options for finding the best health care for their families. That is a fact of life. But -- and here is where political leaders of both parties, whatever their differences, should find common ground -- access to health care shouldn't be a luxury. Health care is not a Mercedes, or a mansion on a hill. A family should not be deprived of it merely because they lack wealth, or have lost employment. Republicans and Democrats, Americans all, should acknowledge that health care is not a diamond bracelet to be gazed at with longing through a store window. It's time to cool down the rhetoric and the finger-pointing. Before we get any deeper into the recriminations about rollouts and delays and extensions and penalties and startovers and repeals, we might want to pause, this Thanksgiving week, to put ourselves in the shoes of the people to whom the promise was profound and real. There but for the grace. . . . The people who need health care and who wait for this mess to be cleaned up are the people who have always been asked to wait. They will wait again, because they have little choice. For the rest of us, perhaps this is a week not only for prayers of thanksgiving for what we have, but also a week for thoughts of those families who believed it when they were told that things were going to change for the better. Who thought it was on the legit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene .","Bob Greene: In politics, to take something on faith is to believe it is ""on the legit""
It's another way of saying: Suckers. People thought health reform was on the legit, he says .
He says at Thanksgiving, politicians should recall who gets left out in health care bickering .
Greene: It's the people who can't afford health care, but believed things would change for better ."
"(CNN) -- May has been a bad month for relations between Taiwan and the Philippines. Taiwan has reacted angrily after one of its fishermen was killed by a Philippine coast guard vessel last week. It has recalled its diplomatic envoy from Manila, frozen applications from Filipinos seeking to work in Taiwan and held naval drills near Philippine waters. The Philippine coast guard has said the crew of one of its ships fired at the Taiwanese fishing boat on May 9 after it tried to ram a Philippine boat. Manila insists that the shooting took place in waters inside its exclusive economic zone and that the loss of life was ""unintended."" But Taiwan says the Philippine vessel sprayed the fishing boat with bullets in waters claimed by the exclusive economic zones of both countries. It says the 65-year-old fisherman, Hung Shih-cheng, was fatally shot in the back. The souring ties between the two countries are born out of the messy mix of competing territorial claims to parts of the South China Sea and nearby waters by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan on Friday described last week's shooting as a ""cold-blooded murder,"" the Taiwanese national news agency CNA reported. Ma has so far deemed the Philippine response to the killing to be unsatisfactory. His government has demanded that Manila make a formal apology, compensate the losses, investigate and punish those responsible, and start talks between the two countries on a fishing agreement. Among the series of measures Taiwan has imposed this week to show its displeasure is a travel alert urging its citizens not to visit to the Philippines. The Philippine government, meanwhile, has started to show frustration with the Taiwanese stance. ""We did what a decent member, a respectable member of the international community should have done,"" Edwin Lacierda, a spokesman for President Benigno Aquino III, said Thursday. ""We have gone the extra mile."" Aquino sent ""a personal representative to extend his apology"" and offer financial assistance to the family of the dead fisherman, Lacierda said, according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. Philippine authorities are investigating the shooting, he said. He warned that the measures imposed by the Taiwanese government would hurt the economies of both countries. Lacierda also appealed to the Taiwanese people not to hurt Filipinos living in Taiwan amid reports of harassment. But Garfie Li, a spokeswoman for Ma, said Lacierda's comments about going the extra mile were ""were untrue and totally unacceptable,"" according to CNA. The United States, an ally of both the Philippines and Taiwan, has expressed regret"" over the fisherman's death and urged the two sides ""to work together and to ensure maritime safety, and refrain from actions that could further escalate tensions."" China has supported Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province. ""We have repeatedly condemned the violent killing of the innocent fisherman since the incident happened,"" Yang Yi, a spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Wednesday, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. ""We have demanded that the Philippine side take the case seriously, find out the truth as quickly as possible and punish those responsible."" Beijing and Manila are already at odds over a different territorial dispute in the region that led to a maritime standoff last year.","A Taiwanese fisherman was killed by gunfire from a Philippine coast guard vessel last week .

"(CNN) -- France's top court ruled Friday that a bill permitting same-sex marriage and allowing gay couples to adopt children adheres to the constitution. President Francois Hollande is expected to sign the bill into law on Saturday. After the lower house of Parliament, dominated by Hollande's governing Socialist Party, passed the bill last month, conservative and centrist senators filed a legal challenge with the court, the Constitutional Council. Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? The legislation admits France to a small but growing club. Lawmakers in New Zealand this year made it the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. The law is set to be enacted later this year. Its move came a week after Uruguayan lawmakers approved a measure allowing same-sex marriage. The measure awaits the signature of Uruguay's president, who has indicated he supports it. If and when the laws in New Zealand, Uruguay and France are enacted as expected, the count of nations allowing same-sex marriage will rise to 14. France would be the ninth country in Europe to allow same sex marriage. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010. Other countries on the list are Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Many countries remain split over the issue. A Brazilian court this week issued a directive removing a barrier that had limited same-sex marriage, but no bill has made it through Congress. Legislators in the United Kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed ""support marriage equality."" In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court and justices are now deliberating over the matter. Twelve U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriages. On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying.","Hollande is expected to sign the bill on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- The best jockey in America, if not the world, is talking about a sport close to his heart -- baseball. For a man who has just scooped the most prestigious horse race in the U.S. -- the Kentucky Derby -- Joel Rosario seems almost reluctant to talk about life on the track. But get him onto baseball, and it's a whole other ball game for the all-conquering rider from the Dominican Republic -- a Caribbean island nation that has just one racing venue. ""I like to be a jockey. But I love baseball,"" the softly spoken 28-year-old told CNN. ""Growing up I played a lot of baseball. But I was small and didn't weigh much. My family thought maybe I could be a jockey, so when I was 12 my half-brother took me to a jockey school."" Small stature, giddy heights . Fast forward 15 years and Rosario is now one of the most successful jockeys on the planet, in the space of just five weeks winning titles his counterparts spend a lifetime chasing. The Latin American, who moved to the U.S. when he was 20, was catapulted to international stardom in March after winning the world's richest race, the $10 million Dubai World Cup, atop thoroughbred Animal Kingdom. Weeks later he was kissing another coveted trophy, the Kentucky Derby, after conquering the mud-splattered Churchill Downs race course on three-year-old colt, Orb. Notching up almost $14 million in prize money this year alone, Rosario has finished in the top three places in a remarkable 57% of his races. ""There's no doubt he's the best jockey in the U.S. today,"" said jockey agent Ron Anderson, who has been in the business 40 years and worked with such riding legends as Gary Stevens. ""He's one of those riders that only comes along every 25 years. He's so tremendously strong and has so much in rhythm with the horse -- it's almost like an instinct."" Triple Crown dreams . A jockey hasn't won America's prestigious Triple Crown -- which includes the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes -- in over a decade. Rosario may be just the man to break that drought. After scooping Kentucky -- the first race in the Triple Crown -- earlier this month, the hype surrounding him has reached a deafening pitch. This Saturday all eyes will be on Rosario and wonder horse Orb as they attempt to take the second race in the coveted treble -- the Preakness Stakes. They are the bookmakers' favorites to win, but Rosario remains a calm island in the middle of the media storm. ""The Triple Crown is the biggest achievement in U.S. horse racing and just to win the first race is something very special to me,"" he said. ""Am I going to win on Saturday? I'm not sure. But I'm confident racing, and my horse has a good chance."" Cool, calm, collected . ""Good chance"" is an understatement. But it's also indicative of Rosario's remarkably relaxed attitude to racing. While other jockeys wake at dawn and spend entire days at the stables, Rosario prefers to play his beloved baseball or golf in the afternoons. The country's top earning jockey usually wakes around 7 a.m., trains for a few hours, races, and plays sport with his friends when he can. ""He's a very humble person, he doesn't think the sport revolves him,"" said Anderson. ""Anyone who does something 365 days a year might not be quite as good as they'd like. This is a different mindset -- it's about trying to keep fresh and excited about racing."" Ball games . That's not to say Rosario hasn't worked hard to get where he is. But you get the feeling that if he'd had been just that little bit taller, he would have chosen professional baseball instead of the track. ""Every boy in the Dominican Republic plays baseball. And everyone thinks they're going to play professionally,"" said Anderson. ""They play it every day of the year. They get out of school and play it until it gets dark. So baseball is really embedded in the national psyche."" Growing up on a farm, Rosario was just five years old when he started riding horses. But it wasn't until he started jockey school that he first laid eyes on the country's one and only race track. Once he did, he was focused on success, moving to San Francisco and working his way up to the top circuits. Today he is the only jockey from the Dominican Republic to win the Kentucky Derby -- doing so just weeks after his nation also won the World Baseball Classic. Now it seems that for the very first time, the country's most famous sports star may not be from the ball park after all.","Baseball-mad Dominican Republic's sporting hero isn't who you'd think .

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . There are more than 7 billion people in the world. Half of them are women and girls. Just imagine the whole world rising, as it will, when all women and girls are empowered. It has to start with education. All the number crunchers have it right on this one: education = empowerment, from here in the United States to Uruguay and Ulan Bator. The United Nations, the World Bank and any organization you can think of say that an educated girl is a girl who can get a job, become a breadwinner and raise herself, her family, her village, her community and eventually her whole country. All the stories and statistics show that a healthy society is one whose women are healthy and productive. Look at what women and girls are achieving for Rwanda, 19 years after the genocide there. The country leads the way in Africa in every way: education, health, the economy, the environment and in elected politics, powered by the force of its women. It is an amazing story. In contrast, the Arab world, which is so rich in natural resources such as oil and gas, is way behind in all development indicators, because half their populations, their women, are denied basic rights. It's why the Arab Spring must liberate and fully empower women, for the good of those countries. Write your own open letter to girls of the world . Did you know that if female employment were to match male employment in the United States, gross domestic product would rise by 5%. And in developing countries that figure soars by double digits -- for instance, GDP would rise 34% in Egypt if women and men had equal employment opportunities. And this is where education comes in. According to a 2004 report co-authored by Gene Sperling (now a senior economic aide to President Barack Obama), a woman can expect a 10% to 20% rise in earning power with every additional year of primary education beyond average. Another economist, Paul Schultz, found that number increased to 15% to 25% higher earning power with each additional year of secondary school. So educate our girls if you want to reduce infant mortality, stabilize population growth and reduce cases of HIV/AIDS. In rural areas, the United Nations says wages, agriculture income and productivity all improve when the female workers are educated. It is time to end the discrimination against girls in education. According to the U.N., around 35 million girls are not enrolled in primary school and that has to end. Almost 800 million people worldwide are illiterate; two-thirds of them are women and girls. Imagine a world where they could actually read and write and do basic math for accounting -- that is how the world will change. Women are much more likely than men to use their earnings for the good of the family, rather than spending it on alcohol or other things for themselves. Just ask the great microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh's Grameen Bank -- women are the best bet. You lend them a little, and they pay back in spades. He has known this for 30 years. It's high time the rest of the world caught on. Go girls! Power the world! We can do it. -- Christiane Amanpour . More: CNN's ""Girl Rising"" Write your own open letter to girls of the world .

"(CNN) -- A man was arrested Friday at the Cannes Film Festival after firing a gun loaded with blanks during a live television interview, sending an Oscar-winning actor running for cover. Canal+ was interviewing Christoph Waltz, who won the Academy Award for best supporting actor in ""Django Unchained,"" and actor Daniel Auteuil when a man fired two shots from a starter pistol, according to authorities and the French television station. The man allegedly had a dummy grenade in one hand, and footage and photographs of the incident show Waltz and Auteuil being taken offstage and attendees scrambling for cover. The incident, which occurred on the Canal+ set along the popular Promenade de la Croisette -- the main boulevard in Cannes -- briefly interrupted the show. Canal+ anchor Michel Denisot came back on the air a short time later and told viewers: ""The shots fired were blanks and the grenade was fake. That's what we know."" No injuries were reported; French authorities have not identified the man. Pictures of the arrest obtained by The Hollywood Reporter show police wrestling the man to the ground. The man said to a woman next to him, 'If I were you, I wouldn't stick around here',"" Denisot later told France 24. It was far from the typical scripted fare of the Cannes Film Festival, where chaos plays out on screen and not among the audience. The annual festival brings together the rich and famous from around the world for movie screenings and glittering parties. The incident followed news the same day that more than $1 million in jewels belonging to the Swiss firm Chopard were stolen from a hotel room in Cannes. The theft of the jewels occurred Thursday night, on the second day of the festival, which opened Wednesday and runs through May 26. Commandant Bernard Mascarelli, of the Nice police, said the jewelry was stolen from a safe in the Suite Novotel hotel on Boulevard Carnot in Cannes. A Chopard employee was staying in the room but left it to go to dinner from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. local time, he said. She returned to discover the safe containing the jewels was missing. The whole safe had been unscrewed from the inside of the hotel room and carried out, Mascarelli said. No detailed description has yet been given of the stolen jewels. Chopard, which is an official sponsor of the festival, has provided the Palme d'Or trophy awarded to the director of the best feature film for the past 15 years. The trophy features a 24-carat gold palm attached to a piece of cut crystal. The firm is promoting its Red Carpet Collection 2013 at this year's festival, with a number of actresses sporting its gems.

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao is not a god, but that doesn't stop millions of Filipinos worshipping him. Since his first professional fight at 16, Pacquiao has amassed a formidable professional record of 54-5-2. He is arguably the most famous person in the country's history, a world title holder 10 times over and the first person to earn belts in eight separate weight divisions, and in 2012 was one of the highest paid athletes on earth, earning upwards of $62 million, more than Tiger Woods, Lebron James, Roger Federer and Cristiano Ronaldo. In addition, he is an actor, TV host and singer. Oh, and in 2010, voters also elected Pacquiao to the Philippines' House of Representatives, where he serves the district of Sarangani. Pacquiao's story reads something closer to fable than fact. The man who earned the title ""Fighter of the Decade"" in the 2000s by the World Boxing Council (WBC), comes from the humblest of roots. Born in 1978 in a small village called Kibawe, Pacquiao lived with his mother and five brothers and sisters: ""When I was young my parents were jobless. We had no home. Sometimes we can't even afford to have a single meal a day,"" says Pacquiao. ""When you see my slippers, one is green, one is red. And they had holes. I would walk the streets to sell, that's how I made my living as a kid. I felt sorry for my mother. I wanted so badly to study. I stopped though and pursued boxing."" At 14, Manny moved to Manila where he says he lived for a time under a cardboard box in a city park. He found work as a servant for a rich man. Luckily, he was treated well, he says. When he began boxing as a teenager, he admits having to put rocks in his pockets to make the minimum weight of 105 pounds (47kg). When he was 16, Pacquiao decided to pursue a professional boxing career. At 4'11'' and weighing 98 pounds, it's unlikely he struck much fear in those early opponents. But his fast fists and unrelenting toughness quickly earned him respect. He gained global recognition in 2001, when as a late replacement, he beat IBF Super Bantamweight title holder Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. Pacquiao won the fight by technical knockout to win the title, his second major boxing world title. Ten years later, I'm standing in the middle of the MGM Grand's casino. ""Do you want to meet him?"" The question came across the table from a documentary film producer, who was profiling Pacquiao. It was May 6, 2011, the night before the champion would defend his WBO Welterweight title against Shane Mosley. The Las Vegas strip buzzed with energy, gamblers and partiers just getting started as it neared midnight. Of course, I said yes. As we got off the elevator and walked down the hallway to his penthouse suite, I had the same feeling you might get when entering a special, reverential space. Two bodyguards flanked the door. They recognized my friend and let us pass. I had expected a reverential, ascetic scene. A peaceful room dotted with his family and close friends speaking in hush tones, careful not to disturb their leader as he prepared to do battle in less than 24 hours. What I found instead was a mob. At least 100 people had packed into his hotel room. Most were Filipino well-wishers. As we tried to make our way in, someone told us Pacquiao and his wife, Jinkee, had retreated to the bedroom. We left, but I wasn't disappointed. I figured I would soon get to know him well in Manila. That night I had drinks with his security guard. I wanted to get to know the man I would be covering. I wanted to hear what he was like from a person who was often closest to him, his bodyguard, in an unguarded moment. He offered little dirt. ""Manny is a very nice guy. Very good to the people around him. He believes he is here for a purpose. That his rise means he has a responsibility to take his position and do something good with it."" Pacquiao won the fight easily. I watched it from the media room. Afterwards, Pacquiao felt good enough to perform a concert at the Mandalay Bay Hotel across from the MGM Grand Casino. He said: ""I consider my experience in life as an advantage in all that I do. I was down there and I have made my way up here now. I have experienced it all. I was trained through all the hardships of life, so I feel the pain of the poor."" In 2010, shortly after being elected as a congressman from Sarangani district, he had given a speech in which he argued the country must do more to organize and fund the efforts of anti-trafficking agencies. Immediately, he began working with the Visayan Forum, at the time, the largest anti-trafficking charity in the country. ""I think Manny is a very important milestone in our fight against human trafficking here in the Philippines because young people actually believe and listen to Manny,"" says Cecilia Flores-Oebanda, executive director of the Visayan Forum Foundation, a charity founded in 1991 to help victims of domestic servitude and forced prostitution. ""He's a hard-working guy, he came from a very poor family. He inspires a lot of people. Of course, everybody wants Manny in their own campaign, but I'm happy Manny is joining our fight."" Click here to get full infographic on human trafficking in the Philippines . Pacquiao arrived at the Visayan Forum headquarters to hear first-hand from girls who had been victimized. He spoke to three rescued girls, all under the age of 12. They had been forced to perform sexual acts in a video chat room for a number of foreign men. Some of the men demanded they perform sexual acts with men pulled off the street, drink their own urine and other even more awful acts. A man off-camera would force the girl's compliance. Pacquiao left shaken. ""Now that I'm here as a congressman, I know what to do. I know what I can do to help people. ""These traffickers have now been warned. We just need to be vigilant in order to sustain this. We also need funding from Congress. In addition, we need close coordination between government agencies. Likewise, we need coordination within various local governments,"" said Pacqiuao. Read how Oebanda was inspired to fight the traffickers . In February 2012, Pacquiao delivered a speech to congress in which he outlined the necessity to stop human trafficking. ""During my visit to the Visayan Forum I talked to children as young as 9-years-old who are trafficked for prostitution,"" Pacquiao told Congress. ""As politicians, we need to be true to our words and actions. We need to send a clear message; that Filipinos are not for sale."" Now more than a year later, the Philippines is in the midst of an election. Congressman Pacquiao is again on the campaign trail -- this time hoping to parlay his popularity into a victory for his wife, Jinkee, who is running to become vice governor of Sarangani district. Campaigning with his wife is one step toward life after boxing. And rumors of the boxing champ's own political ambitions push beyond the House of Representatives. Now, fresh off his stunning loss to Juan Manuel Marquez, in which he was knocked unconscious and lay face-down for several seconds before being helped to his corner, Pacquiao is looking toward his future. Thirty-four is old for a boxer. With more than 60 professional fights under his belt, the fear among those in his circle is that he will stay too long in the game, and do permanent damage to his standing. Speaking to a CNN producer in Tagalog, Pacquiao says: ""In boxing, I don't think people will forget me after I retire. But I really want people to remember me as a public servant, who is good, who is a champion for the people."" Less than two months after his loss to Marquez, Pacquiao scored an equally stunning victory. On February 13, 2013, Philippines's President Benigno Aquino III, signed the Anti-Trafficking bill Pacquiao had been championing, into law. For thousands of vulnerable Filipinos whose lives may be changed or even saved, this Pacquiao fight is one whose legacy will last far beyond the ring.","Boxing star Manny Pacquiao joins the fight against human trafficking .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Bombs struck Sunnis leaving a mosque and attending a funeral in Iraq on Friday, killing dozens amid festering tensions between Sunnis and Shiites. At least 40 people were killed and 46 others wounded Friday in two roadside explosions outside a Sunni mosque in the Iraqi city of Baquba, police and health officials told CNN. Baquba, the largest city in Diyala province, is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Baghdad. That bombing was one of several attacks Friday, and came on the heels of a spate of sectarian violence in the Middle Eastern nation. A roadside bombing in Amirya, a predominantly Sunni western Baghdad neighborhood, left 12 dead and 30 wounded, police officials told CNN. Another roadside bomb in western Baghdad -- this time in al-Jamia -- went off outside the house of Sunni member of parliament Ahmed al-Massari, wounding two bodyguards Friday morning, police said. Al-Massari's brother was shot dead near his house in the Baghdad neighborhood of al-Bayaa on Thursday. South of Baghdad, in the town of al-Madaan, police said at least eight people were killed and 25 were wounded Friday when a roadside bomb exploded at a funeral procession for the Sunni mayor of the town, who died Thursday. Additionally, two people died in a pair of roadside bombing in Baghdad's Dora district, another Sunni neighborhood. Overall, violence has dropped significantly in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence, between 2005 and 2007. But tensions and violence, stirred in part by enmity between Shiites and Sunnis, have persisted since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative for Iraq, called on leaders to protect civilians as another wave of bombings erupted this week, warning that the country ""will slide backwards into a dangerous unknown if they do not take action."" ""It is the responsibility of all leaders to stop the bloodshed in this country and to protect their citizens,"" he said. ""Small children are burned alive in cars. Worshippers are cut down outside their own mosques. This is beyond unacceptable. It is the politicians' responsibility to act immediately and to engage in dialogue to resolve the political impasse and put an end to this."" On Thursday, 11 people -- six in Baghdad and five in Kirkuk -- died in attacks in the two major Iraqi cities. The bloodiest attack was in the northern city of Kirkuk, where a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest Thursday afternoon at the main entrance to a Shiite mosque, police said. On Wednesday, bombings in Kirkuk and Baghdad left at least 29 people dead and 120 wounded, police said.. Read more: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Perched on the edge of her hospital bed, Sarah Murnaghan performs a song she wrote and takes a bow. It's a song about perseverance, with a common refrain of ""you can do it, if you try it."" Sarah is one of those 10-year-olds you feel lucky just to meet. But it's not because of her talents as a budding singer-songwriter, even though they are impressive. It's because of her attitude and her drive for life. Sarah was born with cystic fibrosis and has been in and out of hospitals her whole life. But it wasn't until February when Sarah and her parents, residents of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, were forced to start living at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. For the past several months, her lungs have deteriorated rapidly -- much faster than her family had expected. She has less than five weeks left to live, said her mother, Janet Murnaghan. ""We knew at some point, she would need new lungs,"" her father, Fran Murnaghan, said. ""We had hoped it would be much further down the road, but the disease has progressed."" Sarah, the oldest of four siblings, is well-aware she's sick -- but not aware of just how sick. ""I'm not going to tell her she's dying, because she's 10,"" Janet said. ""I'm going to tell her we're going to keep fighting."" ""I don't want to scare her."" While shooting an iPhone video of her daughter, Janet asks, ""When are we getting you back to school?"" ""Definitely a couple of months before (I go back) -- maybe even a year."" School is one of the things Sarah misses most about life outside of her new environment. ""I used to go to school before I got oxygen,"" Sarah says, pausing to wipe away tears as the ""puffs"" from the oxygen mask toss her bangs. ""Got to go to school and at least try and act like all the other normal children."" Life with cystic fibrosis: 'Pretend you're on a boat' Asked how she would describe living with ""CF,"" Sarah says to ""close your eyes and pretend you're on a boat."" The boat she describes represents her lungs. ""The water keeps the boat afloat, but sand sinks your boat. And all we got is a little sandy, but we're going to be OK."" ""She may feel like she's kind of sinking,"" mom said in a later interview. ""As she said, what you can do ... is kind of brush off the sand, or if you need to get a new boat, kind of start over, which would be a transplant, to get a new set of lungs, so she'd be clean again."" But ""brushing off her boat"" and getting that transplant has proved difficult. Sarah's been on the wait list for new lungs for 18 months, and the Murnaghans were under the impression a transplant was imminent. She is, after all, the No. 1 candidate on the priority list for children in her region, which consists of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and northern Virginia. But that's where it gets tricky -- she tops the list for children's lungs -- not adult lungs. For Sarah, a modified adult lung would fit as well. Two weeks ago, Janet and Fran learned that if Sarah were 12, she'd have a much better chance of receiving adult lungs. But since she is 10, she primarily has access to children's lungs, which are in shorter supply. ""That's insane,"" mom said. ""It shouldn't be about their age. If she's the sickest person, she should qualify."" Few lung transplants for children . In 2012, there were just 10 transplants in Sarah's age group, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. There were more than 1,700 adult transplants. According to the rules created by the organ network, the only way Sarah could receive an adult lung is if the other patients in her region who are 12 and older had a chance at it first. It's a rule that Janet -- who's been dealing with getting her daughter a transplant for 18 months and who ""did her research"" -- learned about just two weeks ago. ""I was shocked,"" Janet said. Dr. Stuart Sweet of St. Louis Children's Hospital is a board member at the United Network for Organ Sharing and helped write the current pediatric transplant system. ""It's not a perfect system. There is no perfect system,"" Sweet said in an interview. ""It's the best we can do right now."" Sweet said Sarah's story ""tugs at his heart"" but that if he changed the system for Sarah's advantage, ""there's another patient, very likely an adolescent, who gets a disadvantage."" ""We've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible."" Mom and dad know that the rules are making it almost impossible for their daughter to receive a pair of lungs through the transplant system. But there is a shred of hope: There is always the possibility that someone steps forward with a direct donation to Sarah. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia declined an interview with CNN for this story, but Janet said doctors are telling her that Sarah could ""crash"" any time now and need intubation, the insertion of a tube into her lungs for breathing assistance. The procedure is especially dangerous for cystic fibrosis patients. She said doctors are planning to operate in coming days in an effort to divert that crash, which should buy her a few more weeks and more time for a potential direct donor to reach out to the Murnaghans. This procedure is known as ECMO -- extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -- and is used occasionally as a bridge to lung transplantation. For now, Sarah, who has been outdoors only twice in the past 100 days, is looking forward to a possible transplant. As she puts it, ""I'm not going for easy -- I'm just going for possible."" ""We will (get them)! I can't wait to take my first breath with new lungs. I can close my eyes right now and imagine it."" ""Are we gonna quit?"" mom asks. Sarah deliberates very briefly. ""No!"" she shouts at the top of her lungs and slapping the bed with both hands. ""I'm never going to quit! Never, never!"" New transplant technology keeps organs 'alive' outside body . Running with someone else's lungs .","Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan has cystic fibrosis and is caught up in a medical tangle .
She needs a new pair of lungs, but the rules say she's still a little too young for adult lungs .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang has called on his nation's tourists to improve their behavior, stressing it was important to project a ""good image of Chinese tourists,"" official state media outlet Xinhua reported. Xinhua reported on Thursday that Wang made the remarks during a State Council teleconference on the implementation of the country's new Tourism Law. The law, adopted in April, is to take effect October 1. It includes measures aimed at addressing issues like unfair competition, price hikes and forced goods purchases that Xinhua said plague the industry. Wang also said it was important develop the tourism sector into a key part of China's economy. In a matter of just a decade or so, Chinese tourists have gone from being relatively rare outside of Asia to becoming the most important market in global tourism, surpassing American and German travelers in 2012 as the world's top international spenders, with a record $102 billion shelled out on the road. With the growth has come a backlash against Chinese tourist in some sectors of the travel industry, particularly Hong Kong. There, mainland Chinese tourists face harsh resentment for a number of issues. Clashes between locals and tourists on public transportation and in restaurants have been caught on video, rapidly gone viral on the Internet and are regular press fodder.

"(CNN) -- Tina and Billy Clark saw the funnel cloud approaching and did what many of their neighbors did. ""We just ran and hid in the closet,"" Tina Clark told CNN after one of a swarm of tornadoes descended Wednesday night into their neighborhood in Hood County, 30 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Texas. ""I was holding the door shut,"" Billy Clark told CNN. ""You could feel the pressure from inside the house. It was like pulling on the door a little bit. The whole house was shaking really bad. It felt like the house was getting ripped apart, but we couldn't see anything from inside the closet, so we didn't know what exactly was going on."" ""You could just hear stuff hitting the house,"" his wife said. Once the storm had passed, they emerged from the closet and noted that their house, perhaps because of its location on a slope, had escaped the brunt of the storm. It was only after they got into their truck and began driving to get out of the impact zone that they began to realize that others had not fared so well. ""Once we turned the corner and got up the street a little bit, I mean, just everything was destroyed,"" said Billy Clark. They came upon neighbors who asked them for a ride to a hospital. ""So we started loading them up,"" Tina Clark said. Among their passengers were two girls. ""They couldn't even walk, they were just covered in blood,"" she said. The couple then came upon a woman and her son. ""They said that the wall got ripped off from the tornado and they got sucked out of the house,"" Billy Clark said. ""The mom, it threw her into a tree head first and busted her head open."" ""I thought that lady was gonna die in my truck,"" Tina Clark said. ""The son, he went outside to go get her during the tornado, and then it pulled him out of the house. He said it threw him through a field and he cut his head on a piece of sheet metal."" They picked up several other children, too. ""The one little girl, all her teeth were knocked out,"" Billy Clark said. ""And then the other girl, she had bones sticking out of her legs, she had a big gash in her arm."" The couple soon found the road blocked by downed trees and power lines. ""There was no way out, so we took them back to the house and called the ambulance, and they just told us to wait,"" Tina Clark said. Instead, they got back into the truck and drove their injured passengers as far as they could, then continued on foot. ""We just had to carry them to the paramedics because they couldn't get to us,"" Tina Clark said. Three people were taken to a nearby hospital, and 13 others were taken to hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, authorities have said. Some of the patients underwent amputations, said Dr. Kerri Sistrunk, head of the trauma unit at Lake Granbury Medical Center. By Friday afternoon, all seven people who had been reported missing had been found, police said. But many more were homeless; 31 people slept in a shelter Thursday night. ""What always amazes me on visits like this is how fast lives can totally change,"" Gov. Rick Perry said Friday after touring Granbury. Neighborhood hit hard . The devastation from what the National Weather Service said were at least 16 tornadoes that killed six people was centered in the Clarks' neighborhood of Rancho Brazos. Of the 110 houses that had stood there Wednesday afternoon, ""there's very few left untouched,"" said Mario Flores, director of disaster-response field operations for Habitat for Humanity, which built 61 homes in the neighborhood. ""Fifty-eight had damage, from minor to total destruction,"" Flores said. ""It's a scene of total devastation."" ""When you look down to where all the rest of the houses normally are, there's nothing there,"" Daniel Layne told CNN affiliate KTRK. ""Piled-up cars, cars in trees, there's a car in our water tower."" He and his wife, Amanda, had waited two years to move into one of the Habitat homes. ""There literally is no Rancho Brazos anymore,"" Amanda Layne said. Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds is no stranger to destruction. ""I've seen bad,"" he said. ""But this is about as bad as it gets."" A survey team for the National Weather Service concluded that the tornado that descended on this neighborhood was an EF4 -- the second-most severe classification on a scale of zero to five. How to help or find help . For some, the extent of their loss remains unclear. Families have not been able to return to their homes in Rancho Brazos since the storms rolled through. Deeds said Friday that ""hopefully"" they'll be able to go in at 8 a.m. Saturday, adding that authorities plan only to ""open things back up on a limited basis."" A curfew applies from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. Ronna Cotten is one of those who haven't been gone back, having been warned it would be days before she couldn't re-enter her subdivision to ""check to see if we have any belongings left."" She has stayed in the home of a woman who picked her up from a rescue center Wednesday night. The mother of four said she survived by clutching to a doorknob as winds tore through her home. ""I feel very lucky, because we are alive,"" she said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Four months before the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989, a woman fired a gun in China's National Art Gallery -- all in the name of art. Xiao Lu fired two shots at her installation on the opening day of the ""China/Avant-Garde Art Exhibition"" in Beijing. Chinese authorities quickly responded. The show was temporarily closed. The artist and her boyfriend were apprehended but later released. Among the stunned onlookers was Beijing-based gallerist and Pekin Fine Arts founder Meg Maggio. ""The army and the armed police came in and we had to leave, but we didn't really understand what was going on,"" she recalls. Twenty-four years on, the authorities' reservations over performance art has not recovered. Wang Chunchen, a leading curator at China's Central Academy of Fine Arts, says there is an unwritten rule against performance art in state-owned exhibitions. ""Performance art has become very sensitive,"" says Wang. ""(But) we need to have a general tolerance to this kind of expression. We need to build an open cultural policy."" Wang is tasked with building that policy as the curator of the China Pavilion at this year's Venice Biennale. ""This year, the Ministry of Culture wants to show a good Chinese image. They are in charge of the Chinese Pavilion. They liked my proposal."" The theme of Wang's proposal is ""transfiguration,"" emphasizing a change in Chinese contemporary art in both practice and definition. His curated selection includes works of painting, video, mixed media and an installation by a non-artist -- a house, once torn down in Beijing, pieced back together and made anew for the Biennale. Wang says the Chinese Ministry of Culture gave him enough space to curate the China Pavilion, but with conditions: ""They gave me enough freedom, but they did give me some suggestions. For example, 'if this painting is too religious, let's not put it in.'"" To be an officially recognized contemporary artist in China, you must stay on script and veer away from the politically taboo. Sensitive topics like the Tiananmen crackdown and the Falun Gong cannot be touched as subject matter. Erotic subjects must not be depicted explicitly. ""And you cannot paint any leader directly (as) a deformed figure,"" adds Wang. ""Besides that, anything you can try. You can experiment."" Given such strict guidelines in a land known for censorship and government control, is there room for authenticity in Chinese contemporary art? For Chinese activist/artist Ai Weiwei, the answer is surely no. In a recent op-ed for British newspaper the Guardian, Ai says outright that ""China's art world does not exist."" ""In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence,"" he writes. Despite a travel ban imposed on him by Beijing, Ai Weiwei's work will be at the Venice Biennale -- but representing Germany. But to gallerists like Meg Maggio or Christie's International Chairman of Asian Arts Jonathan Stone there is indeed a vibrant contemporary art scene in China -- not just despite the restrictions -- but because of them. ""It's the sand in the oyster which creates the pearl,"" says Stone. ""And I think that's something which is rather exciting."" Maggio adds: ""There's a certain level of struggle in contemporary art generally that makes things more exciting. A lot of Chinese artists would say if you're an average middle class Western artist, life is too comfortable and things come easy to them: 'That's not real contemporary art.'"" The Venice Biennale opens on June 1. Visitors to the China Pavilion can decide for themselves if Wang's ""transfigurative"" show can manage to be both on script and on the cutting edge.","Chinese authorities are wary of performance art, partly due to an incident in 1989 .

"(CNN) -- Have you herd? Goats are now scheduled to land at Chicago's O'Hare Airport for a meal and some landscaping. The city's aviation authority wasn't kidding Wednesday when they announced a two-year contract for ""sustainable vegetation management grazing services"" with Central Commissary Holdings. Twenty-five to 30 of the four-legged creatures will chow down on 120 acres of foliage at the airport, including space along creeks and hilly areas too hard and expensive to maintain using other methods, a press release said. To ensure the animals don't try to head butt a 747 they will be separated from the airfield by security fencing, remain supervised while on airport property, and spend evenings in a nearby transport trailer. The curse of the Billy Goat may have haunted the Chicago Cubs for decades, but the airport believes embracing the animals will save money, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and cut down on toxic herbicides. ""This pilot program will help the CDA achieve many economic, operational, environmental and social benefits, achieving our goal of balancing people, planet and profit,"" Aviation Department Commissioner Rosemarie Andolino said in the release. There's no word if the goats will help with World Series hopes. The overall cost for two years of weed eating goats could reach $100,000, but the Chicago Department of Aviation is quick to point out it uses no local or state tax dollars for operations or capital improvements. Other airports have tried grazing goats with mixed results. San Francisco airport uses a herd for two to three weeks each June to clear vegetation for a fire break on the west side of the airport. ""The benefits of the goats is this property is home to two endangered species, the San Francisco Garter Snake and the California Red Legged Frog,"" SFO Airport Duty Manager Doug Yakel told CNN. ""They can clear this vegetation for us without endangering these two species, where heavy machine or mowing might."" But Seattle's Sea-Tac Airport kicked the goats out after only a week in 2008. ""Airport managers decided to discontinue using the goats because they were, in effect, too effective,"" said Christina Faine, an airport spokeswoman. ""Goats, indiscriminate eaters, eat everything, including the trees and native plants that we wanted to protect."" Chicago's goat herd is expected to arrive at O'Hare in about a month.","Chicago's O'Hare Airport plans to use goats as landscapers .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Buoyed by the runaway success of ""Gangnam Style,"" the South Korean company behind music sensation Psy is taking on what has been a tricky market for international record labels to crack -- China. ""While our previous activity in China had been putting on concerts occasionally, we will now be setting up an office in China and aggressively pursue the China market,"" a representative for YG Entertainment told CNN in Seoul. YG is one of three South Korean companies that have largely been responsible for Hallyu -- the Korean wave of sugary and attractive girl and boy bands that have taken Asia by storm over the past decade. And China has not been immune to K-pop's allure. YG's chief operating officer Choi Sung-jun says that acts like Psy, boy band Big Bang and rapper G-Dragon are extremely popular among Chinese fans. G-Dragon's concert on Friday and Saturday at Hong Kong's Asia World Expo has been completely sold out, he added. China's airwaves have been dominated by Chinese-language ""Mandopop,"" but tastes are evolving as the internet gives young people access to different types of music, says Nathaniel Davis, operations director of China-based music industry consultancy Splatter. However, high rates of piracy on both digital and physical products make it very difficult for a label to discover steady revenue streams. ""Labels cannot function or sustain themselves from record sales revenues and so much of their income comes from the 'other' ways artists generate revenue -- endorsements, commercial appearances, ringtone sales, and live shows,"" Davis says. Reflecting these challenges, Choi says the company's initial focus in China will be on making money from concerts. In March, music giants Universal, Warner and Sony, along with China's Gold Typhoon Entertainment, settled a hard-fought music-piracy law suit with Chinese Internet company Sohu that will see the record companies receive royalties and licensing fees. The labels reached a similar agreement with search engine Baidu in 2011. Despite being the world's second largest economy, China ranks 20th globally in terms of recorded music revenue, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). In 2012, recorded music revenues totaled $92.4 billion, up 9% from 2012 but equal only $0.1 per person. Digital downloads accounted for more than 80% of sales in China, compared with 42% globally. China is aware of the problems facing the industry and is concerned that it has not produced a act of global or even regional standing. ""Psy's success seems to be haphazard but it isn't,"" Zang Yanbin, president of the China Record Working Committee told the China Daily in March. ""Behind Gangnam Style are great efforts by the Korean government and music companies to develop and promote Korean pop music. The Chinese government should also try to create better environments for Chinese pop music."" YG's ambitions are not limited to China. The company recently incorporated in the United States and speaks of a ""digital silk road"" spreading K-pop to the world. Last year, the music video to Psy's Gangnam Style went viral to become the most-watched video on YouTube. The song was also the third best-selling single of the year, according to the IFPI, and has helped boost the financial fortunes of YG. The company, which went public in Korea in 2011, reported a 45% increase in net income to 18.8 billion won ($17 million) in 2012. YG said it was too early to say whether they planned to develop local Chinese acts or simply promote their existing artists in the country. But one novel strategy has been adopted by rival SM Entertainment, which is trying to make inroads into the Chinese market with Exo -- a boy band that performs their songs in Mandarin as well as Korean.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Three Chinese airlines received ""false bomb threats"" on Wednesday that caused disruption to five different domestic flights destined for the southern city of Shenzhen, state-run media reported. Shenzhen Airlines said on its official microblog account that it had received multiple threats that lead it to reroute two flights and delay another. A flight to Shenzhen operated by Juneyao Airlines returned to Shanghai, its point of departure, so that the plane, passengers and baggage could all be checked following a threat, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The flight eventually took off using a different plane, the news agency said. China Eastern Airlines received a threat regarding its flight from the northern city of Lanzhou to Shenzhen, via the central city of Xi'an, Xinhua reported. The flight was subsequently cleared for takeoff, it said. According to China Eastern's website, the flight's departure from Xi'an to Shenzhen was delayed by more than two hours. Shenzhen Airlines said that a flight from the eastern city of Nanjing returned to its point of departure, a flight from Xi'an changed course to land in the southwestern city of Guilin, and a flight from Beijing departed late after police talked to passengers.

"(CNN) -- Even if they don't admit it, most people know when they're hammered. But they may not always know when they're legally drunk. If states heed the new recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board, it will be easier for motorists in the U.S. to be arrested for drunken driving. The NTSB wants states to reduce the blood-alcohol content threshold used by law enforcement to prosecute drunken driving from 0.08 to 0.05. In plainer language, that means drivers could be subject to arrest after downing as few as two recent drinks. How do you know when it's safe to get behind the wheel and when you should hand the keys to someone else? Here are some tech tools that can help. Blood-alcohol calculators . If you have access to a computer, there are sites that can estimate your blood-alcohol level. You enter information such as your body weight, the types of drinks you've had and how long you've been drinking, and these online calculators will spit out a number. For example, a 180-pound man typically will hit the 0.05 threshold after two or three drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma. But a 125-pound woman would register an estimated 0.092 after three glasses of wine over the same period, according to BloodAlcoholCalculator.org, whose slogan is ""Check yourself before you wreck yourself."" If you'd prefer to estimate your BAC on your phone, there are calculator apps such as DrinkTracker and IntelliDrink. Keep in mind that these numbers are only estimates and that many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood-alcohol content. Don't treat the results as legal advice. Hand-held breathalyzers . Breathalyzers aren't just for law enforcement anymore. Many manufacturers make small, hand-held versions for people who want to monitor their alcohol intake, or just use them for party games. The battery-powered gadgets, about the size of a cellphone, contain a breath tube and an internal alcohol sensor that gives instantaneous readings. Prices range from $4 for a one-time disposable model to $29 for small keychain devices to $200 or more for more sophisticated ""professional"" models used by police. Beware, however: Some of the cheaper models have been known to produce inconsistent readings. The pricier ones employ fuel-cell sensors, which turn your breath into electrical current that can be precisely measured for levels of booze. The devices are available at sites such as Breathalyzer.net and Alcotester.com. Apps/devices for your phone . If you're looking for a less expensive alternative and want to track your results online, these may be for you. Matchbook-size devices such as the Breathometer and the Alcohoot plug into the audio jack of your iPhone or Android phone. You download the accompanying app, blow into the device's mouthpiece and view the results on your phone. There's only one problem: They're not readily available yet. The Breathometer is available for pre-order for $49 and will ship to customers this fall. The first batch of the $75 Alcohoot sold out, and devices ordered now won't be delivered until at least October. When used over time, the apps give you a history of your drink consumption and blood-alcohol levels to help you understand how your body reacts to alcohol. (In case you didn't know.) If you've had too much, you can also call a taxi via the Alcohoot app. A similar $149 device, the BACtrack, works wirelessly with your phone via Bluetooth and is available now.","New laws could potentially make it easier for U.S. motorists to be arrested for drunken driving .

"(CNN) -- Let's start with the disclaimer: if you go, and something undesirable happens, CNN cannot be held responsible. This is an article that shines a light on the pariahs and the bad eggs, the places that keep Ban Ki Moon up at night and have your travel insurers running for the hills. Why give them column inches? Because the truth is that even the most rough and tumble corners of the world invariably have more to offer than a brag-worthy passport stamp. Often hidden behind the negative headlines and inflexible preconceptions are genuine treasures. These aren't escapades one should embark on lightly. All of the following destinations are currently subject to travel warnings from the U.S. State Department. But the reality is that people do go and, most of the time, not only come back in one piece but have a great time while there. 1. Band-e-Amir Lakes, Afghanistan . If there's one destination guaranteed to upset your parents, it's Afghanistan, a country as synonymous with holiday making as the Taliban are with female emancipation. You may therefore be surprised to discover that intrepid over-landers occasionally travel down the Bamiyan Road to visit a chain of six mountain-rimmed lakes called Band-e-Amir, located high in the Hindu Kush, 150 miles west of Kabul. Designated Afghanistan's first national park in 2009, the sapphire waters of Band-e-Amir have become the shimmering emblem of its concealed tourism potential.

During summer weekends, local families often descend in droves to enjoy much-needed respite from the tensions that prevail elsewhere in the country. ""Bamiyan is Afghanistan's safest region, and the local Hazara tribe are the friendliest people I met in the country,"" reports Ã•nne PÃ¤rl, from Estonia, who visited the lakes while living in Afghanistan with her husband. ""Apart from the odd occasion when locals go fishing with grenades, the lakes are so peaceful you could almost forget that the country has been at war for the last 30 years."" A 14-day Afghan Explorer tour with Wild Frontiers costs around $7,200 per person; www.wildfrontiers.co.uk . 2. Ciudad Perdida, Colombia . One of South America's most alluring jungle treks -- to Ciudad Perdida or ""The Lost City"" in Sierra Nevada -- has long suffered from its proximity to the western fringes of the Santa Marta Mountains, historically a hotbed of cocaine production and the violence that goes with it. The events of 2003, when eight tourists were abducted from the trail by leftist guerrillas (they were released three months later) did little to boost its reputation. A decade on, however, and Colombia's improving security situation has doubled its annual influx of tourists. The trail's popularity has soared, leading some to anoint it the next Machu Picchu.

"(CNN) -- What makes airline passengers happy? Sometimes it's as simple as a smile. Along with mobile check-in, Wi-Fi in the air and other technological advances, the simple act of airline employees smiling is increasing airline passenger satisfaction. Airline passenger satisfaction has improved to its highest levels since 2006, according to J.D Power & Associates' 2013 North America Airline Satisfaction Study released Wednesday. U.S. airlines collect $6 billion in fees . ""Traditional carriers have improved significantly across the entire passenger experience, and it is a positive sign to see them turn a corner and starting to rise again, even as there is still more opportunity to improve,"" said Jessica McGregor, senior manager of J.D. Power's global travel and hospitality practice. ""While satisfaction with low-cost carriers only slightly improves, greater gains in the rest of the experience are masked by lower passenger satisfaction with cost and fees."" The study measures passenger satisfaction with North American airlines based on the following criteria in order of importance: costs and fees; in-flight services; boarding, deplaning and baggage; flight crew; aircraft; check-in; and reservations. Satisfaction improved in every category, but the largest yearly increases were in the boarding/deplaning/baggage, check-in and aircraft categories. JetBlue, Southwest top the airline rankings . For the ninth consecutive year, JetBlue Airways ranked first for satisfaction among all North American airlines. JetBlue also earned the top score among low-cost carriers for the eighth year in a row. Southwest Airlines was a close second among discount carriers with 770 points to JetBlue's 787. Airlines are ranked on a 1,000-point scale. ""Above all, we're grateful for our 15,000 crewmembers that inspire humanity each and every day by going above and beyond to deliver the best customer service in the skies and on the ground,"" said JetBlue spokeswoman Allison Steinberg, via email. Alaska Airlines topped the traditional carrier rankings, with Delta Air Lines in second place. Alaska scored 717 points and Delta scored 682 points. ""We're honored to receive this prestigious recognition from our customers,"" said Alaska Air Group President and CEO Brad Tilden, in a statement. ""Receiving this award six years in a row is a credit to the 13,000 Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air employees who show their dedication to our customers every day and on every flight."" Overall satisfaction with the airlines improved to 695 on the 1,000 point scale, a 14-point increase over the 2012 survey. The power of a smile . Despite passengers choosing to check in online rather than talk to someone at an airport ticket counter, how an airline's employees treat customers still counts. Passengers who are greeted by airline staff with a smile, even infrequently, report satisfaction scores that are 105 points higher than among those who never get a smile. Passengers who report airline staff smiling at them consistently report satisfaction scores that are 211 points higher than those who do not get any airline smiles. ""Airlines don't have to invest millions of dollars in the aircraft to get employees to smile,"" said McGregor. A few trainings, including information about the impact on customer satisfaction, may help the cabin and cockpit crew make better eye contact and smile more, she said. Of course it helps to have happy employees. ""One of things we see is that when you see companies that have high internal employee satisfaction, they have high customer satisfaction as well,"" she said. Customers love technology . Now a smile doesn't take care of everything. Customers also want their technology. Those who use Wi-Fi in-flight are happier (39 points happier) than those who do not use it. More than one-third of customers surveyed check in online, and 15% of those technologically savvy fliers use their smartphones or other mobile devices (compared to 6% two years ago). Passengers checking in via mobile applications are the happiest of all fliers checking into their flights, followed by passengers who check in using a mobile device, passengers who check in at an airport kiosk and those who use the main ticket counter. Baggage fees still lower satisfaction . Even attitudes toward baggage fees are beginning to soften. Although passengers are still dissatisfied with being charged for something that used to be included in the price of a plane ticket, they aren't as grumpy about it. The gap between passengers who pay for baggage and those who do not pay shrank to 63 points this year, compared with an 85 point gap last year and a 100 point gap in 2011. Some 37% of passengers who pay for bags agree that the fees are reasonable, compared to 28% last year and 18% in 2011. ""Baggage fees are still a point of contention for people, and it's still a 'disatisfier,' but people are starting to accept it's a cost to travel,"" said McGregor. To help reduce costs, J.D. Power recommends using an airline's mobile application to check in, select seats and receive an electronic boarding pass. If you don't have an airline credit card or frequent flier status to waive baggage fees, look for discounts when checking in online. The passenger satisfaction study is based on responses from more than 11,800 passengers who flew on a major North America airline between April 2012 and March 2013. Overall airline rankings . Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines topped the traditional carrier rankings, followed by Air Canada (671 points), American Airlines (660), United Airlines (641) and US Airways (630). Low-cost carriers JetBlue and Southwest were followed by WestJet (714), Frontier Airlines (708) and AirTran Ariways (705). (AirTran is now part of Southwest.)

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray's birthday celebrations were brought to an abrupt halt after his plans to compete at the French Open were thrown into jeopardy on Wednesday. A long-term back injury looks set to sideline the world No. 2, who was forced to retire from his second-round match at the Rome Masters on the day he turned 26. And with the Paris showpiece event set to begin on May 26, Murray faces a race against time to prove his fitness. ""I'd be very surprised if I was playing in Paris,"" the British star, who lost in the quarterfinals in Madrid last week, told reporters following his match against Spain's Marcel Granollers. ""I felt pain today, the same as in Madrid. I took a few days off after Madrid. I hit yesterday and played some points. But I was still sore today."" The pain in the lower left of his back has caused Murray discomfort since late 2011 and is the same injury which required a painkilling injection at last year's French Open. ""We will have to wait and see on Paris,"" he said. ""I'll try to make a decision after the next five days or so. I need some days off for it to hopefully settle down."" Murray's retirement came as something of a surprise after he had fought back from losing the opening set 6-3 and being down 4-1 in the second to level the match following a tiebreak. But after undergoing on-court treatment with the trainer early in the second set, Murray decided to call time on his Rome challenge. It is the first time since 2007 that Murray has retired during a contest -- that was at the Hamburg Open where he suffered a wrist injury which ruled him out of the French Open and Wimbledon. Murray, who has never won a clay-court title despite training on the surface as a young teen in Spain, reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros last year. But the U.S. Open and Olympic champion now looks unlikely to challenge for the title in the French capital. ""(The back) has not been perfect for a long period, I want it to start feeling good again,"" the Scot said. ""Everyone goes into matches with niggles, but this is very frustrating. ""Some shots hurt more on clay because the movement is so exaggerated. There is not a lot of power on the ball so you have to generate power and pace yourself. ""I don't want to go into details, but I've got a disc problem, it changes week to week. It's been an issue for a while, but I want to make sure it goes away. ""I don't want to be playing with it long term, it's not enjoyable at all."" Elsewhere, French eighth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga suffered a shock defeat by Jerzy Janowicz, going down 6-4 7-6. The 24th-ranked Pole ripped his shirt off in delight after his best result this year, earning a clash with French ninth seed Richard Gasquet. In the women's section, defending champion Maria Sharapova eased to a 6-2 6-2 win over Spain's Garbine Muguruza. Former French Open winner Li Na overcame Chinese compatriot Zheng Jie 6-3 6-1 as she bounced back from her first-round defeat in Madrid, while there were also victories for Samantha Stosur, Maria Kirilenko and home favorite Roberta Vinci.","Andy Murray faces a race against time to be fit for French Open .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong's favorite new resident, a giant inflatable duck, took a turn for the worse on Wednesday, looking less like an oversized lovable plaything and more like an unappetizing fried egg on the water. The 16.5-meter (54 feet) inflatable sculpture mysteriously lost its mojo overnight, deflated and bobbed lifelessly in Victoria Harbour. Organizers called an urgent duck crisis meeting early Wednesday and didn't immediately respond to questions about the misfortunes of the duck or whether the deflation was part of regular maintenance, as reported in some local media. A tweet did appear however on the official Harbour City Twitter account, saying: ""The Rubber Duck needs to freshen up. Stay tuned for its return."" Much later in the day, organizers responded and said it was a planned deflation. Why it took so long to clarify and why officials had to get senior management approval to make such a statement seems a little odd and naturally, this got Hong Konger's busy with the popular pastime of gossiping. The duck has captivated Hong Kong since its arrival earlier this month and news of the duck's deflation was splashed across Hong Kong media and social networks with many ruminating as to the duck's health. Called ""Rubber Duck,"" it's the product of Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman. After going on show on May 2, it was to be on display until June 9. The artist told CNN earlier this month the duck was built locally so it would be easier to fix should there be any duck drama. Hong Kong is the latest port of call for the duck. It's previously taken up temporary residence in cities all over the world, including Osaka, Sydney, Sao Paolo and Amsterdam. The duck hasn't always enjoyed plain sailing. In 2009 during a port call in Belgium, it was stabbed 42 times by a vandal. ""We don't know why the person did it,"" Hofman said. ""But in the Middle Ages there was a moment when they ruined all the sculptures in Europe. We call it a ""sculpture storm."" The museum that bought the work spoke about 'Sculpture Stormers' that would hit the work - and kill it."" ""But [the incident] brought the people of that town together. The community had a stake out at night and protected it and even the police looked after it. It shows that this piece of art means a lot to people in the vicinity of this work."" The duck team also closely monitor the weather after the duck copped some nasty treatment during a storm in Belgium. ""There is a crew that has wind speed meters and they follow what the weather does,"" Hofman said. ""They monitor by computer and monitor the weather so they can react in advance because we don't want to cry if it gets ripped up.""

"(CNN) -- Airbus has showed off its new A350 XWB, rolling out its first flyable plane on Monday fresh from the paintshop in company livery. The aircraft is the first in a family of super efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head against rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s. ""XWB"" means ""extra wide body."" There are three members in the A350 family: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers respectively, in three-class seating. The largest of the three lightweight carbon-composite aircraft, the A350-1000, is 73.88 meters long and has a range of approximately 8,400 nautical miles, or 15,600 kilometers. The catalog price is US$320.6 million. As of March 31, there were 110 orders for the A350-1000 among a total of 616 orders from 34 customers. Most orders, 414, have been for the A350-900. The plane unveiled on Monday at Airbus HQ in Toulouse, France is the latest milestone in what has been a turbulent production history for the A350.

"Washington (CNN) -- An envelope that tested positive for the deadly poison ricin was intercepted Tuesday afternoon at the U.S. Capitol's off-site mail facility in Washington, congressional and law enforcement sources tell CNN. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was told the letter was addressed to the office of Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi. A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin after initial field tests indicated the poison was present, according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer. However, the FBI said additional testing is needed as field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results. ""Only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin,"" according to the bureau. ""Those tests are in the process of being conducted and generally take from 24 to 48 hours."" A law enforcement source said more tests would be conducted at the Army's biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, Gainer wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides. Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters after a briefing for lawmakers that a suspect has already been identified in the incident, but a knowledgeable source said no one was in custody Tuesday night. Wicker, the junior senator from Mississippi, has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source. A primer on ricin . Postal workers started handling mail at a site off Capitol Hill after the 2001 anthrax attacks that targeted then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle and Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, among others. Senators were told the post office would be temporarily shut down ""to make sure they get everything squared away,"" McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday afternoon. ""The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked,"" she said. Members will be warning their home-state offices to look out for similar letters, she added. A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified a letter in a Senate mailroom that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office. The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said. Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed. It can be produced easily and cheaply, and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction. Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in London and died four days later. Wicker, 61, was first appointed by former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour to the U.S. Senate in December 2007 after the resignation of then-Sen. Trent Lott. He was then elected to the seat in 2008 and won re-election in 2012 to a second term. Before joining the Senate, he was a U.S. representative in the House from 1995 to 2007. Before that, he served in the Mississippi Senate. CNN's Rachel Streitfeld and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of ricin, Senate official says .

"(CNN) -- An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law. ""We did not enforce martial law. Everything is normal,"" said Chao Lumen, an official with the information department of Xilingol prefecture. In the report released Friday, Amnesty International detailed protests in and around the city of Xilinhot, the prefecture's seat of government. ""Nothing happened here. There were no demonstrations or protests,"" Chao said Monday. The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests. The region has long been the scene of ethnic tension between Mongolians, who have lived in the area for centuries, and the Han people, who arrived in larger numbers after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Han people are the majority ethnic group in China. According to the human rights organization, 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets Wednesday in Xilinhot, in a show of solidarity with an ethnic Mongolian herder by the name of ""Mergen,"" who was killed earlier this month when he was hit by a coal truck that was driven by ethnic Hans. Amnesty reported that the drivers of the coal truck are both in custody of Chinese authorities. In a clip posted to YouTube that purports to show that same demonstration, a large group of people, many of whom are young people wearing school uniforms, can be seen walking through the streets. The students were marching toward the building that houses the regional government, shouting, ""defend our land and defend our rights, according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center. The group refers to the area as ""southern"" -- not ""inner"" -- Mongolia, and would like to see the region achieve independence or merge with Mongolia. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip. According to Amnesty, the protests, which started May 23, have been largely peaceful, but at least 18 people were reported injured in confrontations with police northeast of Xilinhot, in Right Ujimchin Banner, or Xi Wu Qi in Mandarin. ""The protests are a wake-up call for the authorities. As in other minority areas, authorities must start heeding the message rather than attacking the messengers,"" said Catherine Baber, Amnesty's Asia pacific deputy director. Protesters say their culture is under threat as pastoral herders are pushed out from the grasslands and forced to move to the cities, or to places where animal grazing is not possible, according to Enghebatu Togochog, Director of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center. He traces the motivation for recent demonstrations to the Chinese central government's efforts, in recent years, to expand coal mining and production in areas that have traditionally been used for grazing.","The region in northeast has long been the scene of ethnic tension .

"(CNN) -- Like gin and tonic without the lime, like Hendrix without the guitar, sushi wouldn't be sushi without Japanese soy sauce. You might pay scant attention to that funny bottle with the bright red cap, but for many, soy sauce is serious business, worthy even of a pilgrimage to its homeland of Yuasa. A 40-minute train ride from Wakayama City (about 100 kilometers south of Osaka), the tiny town of Yuasa is the birthplace of the fermented condiment. It also happens to be a great place to revisit Japan's historic Edo period (1603-1868). More on CNN: The best sushi restaurants in Tokyo . Here's how the salty legend goes . Some 750 years ago, a Japanese priest arrived in Yuasa after a trip to China, bringing with him a newfound skill for making miso (soybean paste). Soy sauce was discovered accidentally -- a byproduct of the miso-making process. Yuasa soon became the country's most important soy sauce brewing center. Despite being a town of just a thousand or so houses, at one time it was crammed with more than 90 soy sauce stores, almost one soy sauce shop for every 10 homes. Today, the entire city is protected by Japanese law -- its of 323 houses and other traditional buildings (four soy sauce breweries included) recognized for their immense cultural value. Called ""hongawara,"" some of the oldest buildings date back more than 400 years. Many still have their traditional lattice windows and curved tile roofs. Generally tranquil, Yuasa is the kind of place where friendly residents chitchat with neighbors and museums and shops are often left open and unattended. Travelers can sign out free bikes or check out the historic area on foot. In addition to the old soy sauce breweries, there are shrines and other interesting pieces of architecture worth some Facebook bragging. More on CNN: 10 things that make Wakayama Japan's best kept secret . Salty attractions . The Yuasa area is stocked with historic attractions. Founded in 1841, Kadocho is one of the area's oldest soy sauce factories. It still uses the same huge tub it always has to brew soy sauce. It also has an exhibition hall across the street with the original tools used to brew soy sauce. During Yuasa's annual Andon (paper lantern) Festival, the streets of town are lighted with paper lanterns; the Andon Gallery is an ode to the Japanese paper lantern. Formerly a public bathhouse dating to the Edo period, Jinburo has displays documenting life in ancient Yuasa. Renovated cafes in Edo-period machiya (traditional wooden houses) and a 113-year-old sushi restaurant, Nihonryori Yokogusu, offer visitors a way to check out the interiors of Yuasa's old structures.

"(CNN) -- In today's world of catchy buzzwords, a current favorite is ""Africa is rising."" Africa's tech scene is a soaring firebird and all the techies on the continent will tell you something game-changing is coming and Africans will build it. In case you haven't heard, apparently the next Facebook, Google or Microsoft will come from Africa. That's what the young mavericks are working towards. In Africa, we worship at the altar of innovation . Innovation is the fountain from which most African entrepreneurs drink -- their raison d'etre. This is hardly surprising on a continent that leapfrogged the tech scene, producing insanely useful mobile solutions. It seems it is only logical that the continent will build the next big thing. But innovation has become quite formulaic for the quick-talking 20-somethings just itching to change the world. Just like any formula, it has strict rules: find a problem, build an app to solve it, develop for smartphone and add social integration. Read more: Why tech innovators are Africa's future . The tech ecosystem is desperate to set itself up as the next Silicon Valley -- a playground for mavericks, dropouts and wheeler-dealers who want to turn an industry on its head. The current atmosphere is electrifying with possibilities for a continent primed as an innovation and entrepreneurial destination. But businesses are so desperate to innovate that solid business models seem to be missing in their plans to take over the world. Good, solid businesses are become boring, and making money is an afterthought. Right now there is nothing sexier than Africa's trendy and attention-grabbing tech scene. It's like the hero of a great tale: down and out, talented, with nothing to lose. Innovation is the watchword. Investors make no secret that they prefer companies that are innovative, mentors recommend it and journalists dedicate headlines to the most innovative companies. Like a ferocious monster, its appetite is insatiable and most startups are victims of it. At this stage we might have to rename Africa ""the place where good companies die of too much innovation."" Read more: ""Africa's tallest building"" set for $10 billion tech city . I recently attended an event where a group of startups in an incubator pitched their companies after eight weeks in the program. One of the companies that was profitable in the beginning with a solid business model (but which could be considered run of the mill) had pivoted so it could do something more innovative. Truth is, chances of the new business making money are very unlikely. In an environment where all the other companies around it seemed to be innovating in an interesting way with new technology, the pressure to innovate killed a good business. Solve a real problem, damn it . Interestingly, Africa's key drivers in terms of innovation came from very simple products that wanted to solve real problems. The continent that brought Ushahidi, M-Pesa and EC2 cloud found a real gap in the market and developed solutions for it. Africa's pool of talented developers and entrepreneurs want to prove that they can compete on the same stage with more mature markets. They can, but the rules are different. Africa hasn't solved some of the basic problems that mature markets have solved. Building bandwidth-heavy apps is not a good idea because the majority of the continent just isn't ready. As much as almost everyone in Africa uses a mobile device, the data problem is still a key thought. So perhaps, for one unimaginable moment, we should forget about building the next Facebook, Google or Apple. Think about using your vast technical skills; solve the simplest problem Africa faces -- service delivery. Think of the innovation that would come with that, think how very big that would be. Hipsters don't build boring companies . In Africa's tech entrepreneurship scene everyone walks around like mavericks, but it is all a show. There is a fundamental lack of passion. In a bid to be different there is sameness. Being a tech entrepreneur seems to be more about joining the sexy cool kids in the ongoing exclusive party where the tech scene is glamorized, workaholism is something to boast about and arrogance slowly becomes familiar. How to run a real business seems to be of very little consequence. More entrepreneurs need to consider bootstrapping their companies with the many free services out there until they are profitable enough to invest in more infrastructure. A crazy idea like that might work and even attract the much sought-after foreign investment that entrepreneurs covet. Read more: Africa hungry for homegrown online content . Before I get charged with treason, I'd like to point out that there is nothing wrong with innovation. However, not all businesses are meant to be crazy innovators. Some of the more successful businesses work on an old-fashioned business model that comes with a twist. Bells and whistles or fancy technology aren't always cool, but a good, sensible way of doing business that provides jobs is. It's easy to get caught up in Africa's tech scene, to feed its appetite for innovation, to hype up the novelty while encouraging the wannabe mavericks. But first, perhaps, it is time for tech entrepreneurs to ask what Africa needs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michelle Atagana.","African entrepreneurs place too much importance on innovation, says Michelle Atagana .
Startups are forgoing solid business models in favor of trendy concepts, she says .
Tech wizards should first tackle the problem of service delivery ."
"(CNN) -- Dominik Paris sped to victory in the first World Cup downhill of the men's season at Lake Louise in Canada on Saturday. The 24-year-old Italian crossed the finish line in one minute, 49.90 seconds to bag his first win of the season with Austrian Klaus Kroell finishing just 0.03 seconds behind in second. Adrien Theaux from France finished 0.11 seconds behind Paris to take third place. ""I am very happy but it has been a difficult run for me,"" Paris said afterwards. ""The middle section of the course was really bumpy but I am glad I figured out a way to keep pushing. ""It's a great way to start the season and now all I can hope is that I keep skiing like this in the next races and once the Olympics in February come around we will see how things go,"" he added. Veteran racer Kroell, who won the World Cup downhill title in 2012 and finished second last year, was satisfied with second place. ""It was such a tight race,"" said the 33-year-old. ""It always seems to be tight when I'm on the podium. I can't say I like it, it would have been better to be at the front of those few hundreds but it was a good race and I am happy to start with a podium."" Bode Miller was the highest placed American in 16th, 1.38 seconds off Paris' pace with compatriot Steven Nyman finishing down in 19th a further 0.26 seconds back. Meanwhile across the border at Beaver Creek, Colorado, Switzerland's Lara Gut continued her brilliant start to Olympic season with a win at the World Cup Super-G event. Read more: Gut claims first GS title . The 22-year-old, who won the first women's downhill race of the season on Friday, finished in a time of one minute 18.42 seconds with Austria's Anna Fenninger taking second place 0.92 seconds behind with compatriot Nicole Hosp finishing third. Fenninger and Hosp's teammate Elisabeth Goergl had originally finished second but was later disqualified for using the wrong width of skis. Last season's overall women's champion Tina Maze finished in 14th place, while Leanne Smith was the highest ranked American skier finishing 23rd. ""Everything is going so fast when you're skiing super-G, so I can't really remember what happened,"" said Gut who will look to complete a clean sweep of wins at Beaver Creek in Sunday's giant slalom. ""I just tried to push on every gate, because it's a really challenging course ... maybe I was pushing a bit too hard."" One woman who isn't pushing too hard just yet is Lindsey Vonn who delighted her fans on Thursday when she revealed on Facebook that she was back on the slopes following a fall in training earlier this month. ""First day back on snow since my crash and it was awesome!"" Vonn said. ""I'm very thankful for many things this year (family, loved ones, great fans) but at this moment I'm happy to be on the mountain doing what I love -- skiing!! Happy thanksgiving everyone!"" It was feared that the latest setback to the knee which required surgery and a lengthy layoff earlier this year would almost certainly rule Vonn out of defending her Olympic downhill title in Sochi. But the 29-year-old's prompt return to training has raised the prospect of a far quicker return to competition, possibly next weekend as the women head to Lake Louise.

"(CNN) -- African warlord Joseph Kony and his struggling militia are poaching elephant ivory across central Africa to get funds for weapons, ammunition and food, a report says. Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. He is accused of recruiting underage boys as fighters and girls as sex slaves, and is the subject of a massive manhunt aided by U.S special forces. His militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, has been butchering elephants for years, according to a report released Tuesday by various groups, including the Enough Project and the Satellite Sentinel Project. ""Greater investments are needed to combat the LRA across central Africa,"" said co-author Kasper Agger, an Enough Project field researcher. ""Governments in Asia and elsewhere who fail to regulate the illegal ivory trade share responsibility for atrocities committed by the LRA and other armed groups engaged in poaching."" The report includes accounts by former captives, who say that the militia trades ivory with customers who land in the vast forest in helicopters. U.S. offers $5 million for information leading to Kony . Africa's elephants are facing higher risks as demand for ivory grows in Asia. Over the last decade, conservationists say poachers have reduced Africa's forest elephant population by 62%, threatening the magnificent mammals with eventual extinction. Unlike decades past when poachers across the continent ran down elephants using spears, attackers are now highly organized and armed with sophisticated weapons. In northern Cameroon, heavily armed poachers are known to swoop in on horseback in the vast forests. The vast Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the areas mostly targeted by the militia, the report said. Kony and his militia are wanted men. The United States is offering $5 million for information leading to the arrest, transfer or conviction of three top leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army, including Kony. A small number of U.S. special forces are advising and assisting regional military efforts to hunt him down.","Report: The militia gets funds for weapons, ammunition and food .

"New York (CNN) -- About a half-dozen bikers accused of beating an SUV driver last weekend used their helmets to attack him and kicked his head and body as he lay on the ground, New York police said. Police said one of the bikers -- Robert Sims -- also stomped on the driver's head and body, according to a detective's criminal complaint. Sims was one of two bikers who turned himself in to authorities on Friday. He has been charged with attempted assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a weapon. According to police, Sims can be seen in a video going after the SUV. The driver of the SUV suffered two black eyes and cuts on his face and side, requiring stitches, the criminal complaint said. One of the bikers, Edwin Mieses, was critically injured in the melee. His wife said he is paralyzed. The other biker who turned himself in, Reginald Chance, is also suspected in the beating of driver Alexian Lien. Police identified the 37-year-old Chance as the man seen in the video pounding his shiny helmet against the SUV. Chance appeared for arraignment Sunday and was charged with first-degree assault and gang assault, both felonies; unlawful imprisonment; criminal possession of a weapon and criminal mischief, according to court papers. His bail was set at $75,000 cash or $100,000 if secured by property, and his next court appearance was set for October 11. Chance's lawyer, Gregory Watts, said his client didn't take part in the beating. He said Chance and Mieses are also victims in the case, and he urged prosecutors to call a grand jury to investigate Lien. ""We concede the criminal mischief,"" Watts said. ""It's obvious that he overreacted. But the law does permit someone who is a victim of an accident to at least attempt to get the identification of the motorist. My client obviously overreacted in that manner, but he is not this thug assaulting someone who's harmless, contrary to the public opinion that's being put out there."" Source: Off-duty police officer among bikers who saw SUV driver beaten . The clash . Lien was in his Range Rover on his way back from an outing to celebrate his wedding anniversary with his wife and their 2-year-old daughter. Dozens of bikers swarmed past him on Manhattan's West Side Highway. A cycle quickly slowed down in front of Lien, who bumped its rear tire, slightly injuring rider Christopher Cruz. Lien pulled to a stop, and angry bikers surrounded his vehicle, hitting it and spiking its tires, police said. Lien stepped on the gas, plowing into three more bikers, including Mieses, who was critically injured. One of the bikers, wearing a helmet camera caught the dust-up on video, which later in an edited version appeared on the Internet. It showed the Range Rover stopping at a later point with the biker gang still in pursuit. A man, who police say was Sims, got off his motorcycle and opened Lien's door, police spokesman Sgt. Carlos Nieves said Friday. Lien drove off with his door slightly open, but further down the road, traffic backed up, cutting off his path, and allowing the motorcyclists to corner him. A biker, who police identify as Chance, smashed the driver's side window with his helmet. That's where the video ended. Afterward, some of the bikers dragged Lien from the vehicle and beat him, police said. His wife and daughter were unharmed. Cop among the bikers . An off-duty New York police officer was riding with the bikers Sunday and saw much of the confrontation that ended with five injured. But he didn't step in, an official said. He also didn't tell his superiors about what happened until Wednesday, the source said. The officer, who works undercover, is a member of the motorcycle club. He may not have been legally obligated to immediately intervene, according to the same source. It's not clear why he waited so long to report what he saw. He has hired a lawyer and is being investigated by the New York Police Department's internal affairs unit. Opinion: In attack, can bikers get a fair shake? Interrogations, arrest . Police seized the helmet-cam video and questioned the motorcyclist who shot it. They arrested Cruz, 28, the biker who abruptly slowed in front of the Range Rover. He is charged with misdemeanors including reckless driving. Cruz was later released after posting $1,500 cash bail and a $15,000 insurance bond. His license was suspended, and he was ordered to surrender his passport. Cruz's lawyer insisted he is not guilty. ""His motorcycle was struck, and he stood right there,"" his attorney H. Benjamin Perez said. ""He never assaulted this man. He never tried to assault him in any way. And he does not know any of the other motorcyclists who were involved in this beating."" A second biker, who was in custody, was released Wednesday, when authorities determined that he may have been trying to help. The NYPD released photos Sunday of two other men they want to find and question as part of the investigation and asked for the public's help in identifying them. Mieses' family, meanwhile, says he is the real victim. ""All of his ribs are fractured. His lungs are so badly bruised that he's still on a ventilator,"" Yolanda Santiago, his mother, told CNN affiliate WCBS. Mieses' wife, Dayana, told CNN affiliate WBZ that he got off his bike to help the SUV driver. She blamed Lien. ""He got scared; he peeled off, and he paralyzed my husband on the way,"" she said. 'We could not have done anything differently' Lien was treated at a hospital for slashes to his face. ""My husband was forced under the circumstances to take the actions that he did in order to protect the lives of our entire family,"" his wife said. ""We know in our hearts that we could not have done anything differently, and we believe that anyone faced with this sort of grave danger would have taken the same course of action in order to protect their family."" It was Lien's wife who made the last of three 911 calls the family placed during the incident. Bikers have called for Lien to be charged. ""That wasn't fear, that was aggression -- he ran over three bikes,"" a man who identified himself as Jose told reporters Thursday night. ""Are we saying, if you feel nervous you can kill somebody? You can paralyze somebody? I think we need to charge him immediately."" Angry netizens have turned on the bikers, casting them in a bad light. One biker called for cool heads to prevail. ""We are not here to blame anyone, we are not here to point any fingers,"" Albert Elkerson said. ""The true question is how could we have avoided what happened last Sunday, and what can we do to prevent that."" CNN's Susan Candiotti reported from New York; CNN's Tom Watkins and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Lateef Mungin, Pamela Brown, Kevin Conlon and Marina Carver contributed to this report.","Lawyer says Reginald Chance was a victim and didn't take part in the beating .

"(CNN) -- As relatives began to say their final goodbyes to their slain children, investigators in Connecticut worked Monday to better understand what happened to them, including digging deeper into the gun and computer use of the 20-year-old man who ended their lives. In recent days, authorities have established that Adam Lanza shot open an entrance into Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School. He fired multiple magazines -- each one with 30 bullets -- from a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to kill six adults and 20 children from two classrooms. Each victim was shot multiple times before Lanza used a handgun to kill himself. Why? Authorities haven't given a motive. But they are looking into shards of the remnants of the shooter's smashed home computer -- -- including e-mails he may have sent and websites he may have visited -- hoping it will shed light on his thinking, a law enforcement official said Monday. Authorities are also probing Lanza's history with firearms. The three weapons found near his dead body were the semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle made by Bushmaster and two handguns made by Glock and Sig Sauer. A shotgun was found in his car nearby, according to Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance. The weapons belonged to his mother, Nancy Lanza, who was found shot dead in her Newtown home Friday. She collected firearms, shot them and went to gun ranges, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman Debora Seifert said Monday. The mother and the son who killed her even went to a range together. From what the ATF has been able to determine thus far, ""their most recent visit was more than six months ago,"" Seifert said. Beyond such developments, officials overall were tight-lipped Monday about their investigation. Hundreds of state troopers, detectives and other law enforcement personnel are analyzing every round of ammunition fired, examining the gunman's medical history and talking to witnesses, said Vance, the state police spokesman. Investigators plan to interview a pair of adults wounded ""in their lower extremities."" The hope is the two -- whom authorities have not identified, though a parent last week said one was a vice principal at the school -- could, ""when it's medically appropriate,"" play a key role in helping to reconstruct what happened, said Vance. ""I'm not at liberty to discuss any of the information so far uncovered, but suffice it to say ... we will cover every single facet,"" the police spokesman said of the investigation. First funerals and addressing 'the unthinkable' The anguish caused by the shooting was visible Monday outside a Newtown funeral home, as young and old streamed in to pay their respects to 6-year-old Jack Pinto. One of the sports fanatic's idols, New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz, paid tribute during his game Sunday by writing ""Jack Pinto My Hero"" on his cleats. Afterward, the NFL player said he is ""amazed"" Jack's family chose to bury the boy wearing a child-size Cruz jersey. ""I don't even know how to put it into words,"" Cruz said. The 6-year-old himself was a budding athlete. Shortly before his death, he wrestled in his first match and earned a medal, said New Milford Youth Wrestling Association President Ken Linder. Many of his teammates wore medals into Jack's funeral Monday. Others, many of them about his age, came in Newtown youth sports shirts. The funeral home couldn't contain the mourners, with the line extending to the street. Jack wasn't the only one remembered Monday. So, too, was Noah Pozner, another 6-year-old whose family said he could get what he wanted just by batting his long eyelashes. Noah loved playing with his siblings, especially his twin sister. They still don't know how their brother died, Noah's aunt said. ""How do you tell them that's how their brother died?"" Victoria Haller said Sunday. ""It's the unthinkable, really."" More funerals are coming. For instance, there's Jessica Rekos on Tuesday. Benjamin Wheeler on Thursday. Madeleine Hsu on Friday. All of them are 6 years old. And once everyone is buried, residents say it's unlikely their tight-knit community will ever be the same. ""It's incomprehensible, the pain here,"" Darla Henggeler said. ""You can't imagine. We're still in shock. I can't let my heart go there because it's so overwhelming. ""Once it settles in, I think my heart will break."" Ex-school official: Lanza would 'withdraw into his own little world' When he was the Newtown public schools' director of security, Richard Novia knew Adam Lanza. In high school, the then-teen had psychological issues and would sometimes ""withdraw into his own little world,"" Novia said. But he never saw Friday's carnage coming. ""I interacted with that boy daily for several years,"" Novia told Nancy Grace from HLN, CNN's sister network. ""And I can tell you that there was no indication he would carry out a heinous act."" Lanza worked with Novia in Newtown High's Tech Club, with his mother -- who the former security director described as ""doting"" and very involved in her children's lives -- often taking part in its activities. She'd also be called to the school when Adam Lanza ""would have little episodes ... where he could not ... talk or communicate, even what he was feeling."" Citing local school authorities, Vance said Monday there was ""no connection"" between the shooter and with the elementary school he targeted. Cynthia Jaroszewksi, though, told CNN that Lanza once attended that school and was even in the same first- and third-grade classes as her daughter, Rebecca. No class for Sandy Hook students 'until further notice' As to Sandy Hook's current students and faculty, they will be out of school ""until further notice,"" Newtown Police Lt. George Sinko said. When classes do resume, it will be in a different place. Authorities have said Sandy Hook students and staff will be at Chalk Hill Elementary in neighboring Monroe, Connecticut, with Gov. Dannel Malloy saying he's signed an order to expedite such a move. In fact, moving trucks were parked outside the Newtown school Monday, to transport supplies and equipment to their home. School will be in session for other students in town Tuesday, albeit after a 2-hour delay. ""Be assured that the safety of your children and our staff are our first priority,"" Superintendent Janet Robinson told parents in an e-mail. ""(Police) Chief (Michael) Kehoe along with his colleagues from the State Police and surrounding communities are implementing a security plan which will provide increased presence at all of our schools.""

Preventing future Newtowns isn't just on Connecticut residents' minds. The massacre has spurred talk nationwide about gun violence and how to prevent it. President Barack Obama's call for change was the centerpiece of his address Sunday night at Newtown High School. Referencing other mass shootings over the last two years, he said Americans can't ""honestly say we're doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm."" To that end, Obama promised, ""In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement to mental health professionals, to parents and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this."" Read more: ""We can't tolerate this anymore,"" Obama says . While gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association have been largely silent since Friday's shooting, others have spoken up. Malloy, Connecticut's governor, said Monday, ""I'd love to hear the people argue that we need 30-round magazines and that's somehow tied to the right to bear arms. We're not talking about basic weapons that are used in hunting."" Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and ""proud gun owner,"" said he's now committed to ""dialogue that would bring a total change"" given what happened in Newtown.

John Licata told CNN's iReport there needs to be better vetting before people buy guns, and assault weapons should be banned -- something Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, says she'll propose once the new Congress convenes in January. CNN iReporter Jameson Riley said the shooting shows the need for more armed guards in schools. Riley, a gun owner, said recent mass shootings have made him consider getting a concealed weapon permit. ""I have a 2-year-old daughter, and she is the light of my life,"" he said. ""And I would like to protect her."" Others said Americans shouldn't change how they live, contending that doing so is a victory for perpetrators of violence. ""Yes, I hugged my son so tight when he got home from school that day that he asked what was wrong,"" one CNN.com commenter wrote.

"(CNN) -- When Angelina Jolie revealed she'd had a double mastectomy, she probably had a pretty good idea that her bravery would empower other women to tell their breast cancer stories. What she didn't know was that one of these women co-anchors a national morning news show. On May 14, when Zoraida Sambolin walked into work and heard Jolie's news, she realized this was the right time to tell viewers that five weeks before, she'd been diagnosed with breast cancer and had decided to have a double mastectomy. ""Angelina Jolie chose to bear her soul in writing and I chose to follow her lead in front of all our viewers Tuesday,"" she later wrote in an article on CNN.com.

"Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- Nigeria's Boko Haram is responsible for kidnapping a French priest in neighboring Cameroon -- the same day the U.S. government labeled the group a terrorist organization -- said the governor of Cameroon's Far North region. Though Gov. Fonka Awa Augustine ordered his region's border with Nigeria closed, it may be too late, as eyewitnesses reported seeing the armed militants cross into Nigeria on motorcycles after Wednesday's kidnapping. ""This is shocking,"" the governor said Friday. ""All expatriates should restrict their movement in this region. They should stay within much secured areas and avoid visiting touristic sites."" The priest, Georges Vandenbeusch, was snatched from his parish church in Nguetchewe, about 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the Nigerian border, security officials said. ""Our Father Georges was kidnapped just a few minutes after celebrating holy Mass that night,"" Mbah Anatole Asah, a Christian in the parish, said Wednesday night. Witnesses said they believed Vandenbeusch was targeted because he is French and Christian. Boko Haram has declared a ""war on Christians"" as it strives to spread a strict brand of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria. Boko Haram has not claimed responsibility for Vandenbeusch's abduction. The abduction comes the same week that the Nigerian army killed seven Boko Haram militants and injured others during a firefight in the Damboa area of Borno state, about 115 kilometers (72 miles) from the Cameroon border. Soldiers also seized a pickup truck, two motorcycles, ""large arms"" and ammunition, according to a statement. The army said it has recently intensified its patrols in the forested areas of Damboa and Gwoza, destroying Boko Haram camps, hideouts and vehicles. Earlier this year, Boko Haram kidnapped a French family of seven, including four children, in Dabanga near the Nigerian border. They were released unharmed days later. Security analysts in Cameroon blame the kidnappings on the lawlessness in north Cameroon and poor security along its porous border with Nigeria. Witnesses said the unarmed Cameroonian border patrol fled when the heavily armed militants approached the border Wednesday night. ""The security is weak. It is very weak,"" legal expert Ngalim Bernard Yongabi said. The kidnappers left bullets in the priest's home, state radio reported. Security officials said they believe the bullets are a sign of Boko Haram's willingness to fight as Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan seeks this month to extend a state of emergency in the northeast. The state of emergency was declared in May. Boko Haram militants do not have the financial capacity to conduct large-scale military operations, Yongabi said. ""Their activities in northern Nigeria have been stoked by the Nigerian military. They are now exploiting the weak security in Cameroon to hibernate in Cameroon and take foreigners hostage,"" he said. Fonkam Azu, governor of Cameroon's northern region of Maroua, said specialized military forces have been sent to secure the border with Nigeria. Dozens of foreigners, including U.S., French and British citizens, have been pulled back from dangerous areas in northern Cameroon into more secure cities. In freezing the group's assets and placing travel bans on Boko Haram's members this week, the U.S. State Department said the organization is responsible for thousands of killings since 2009. Human rights groups put the number at 3,000. Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, has a $7 million bounty on his head. U.S. designates Boko Haram as a terrorist organization . The terror outfit, whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege"" in the Hausa-Fulani language, has attacked numerous targets since forming in the late 1990s, killing and kidnapping Westerners and bombing schools, churches and mosques, according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. Recently, Boko Haram was blamed in an August mosque attack in Nigeria's Borno state that killed 44 worshippers, September attacks in Benisheikh that left 160 civilians dead, many of them Muslim women and children, and a September assault on an agriculture school in which 50 students were killed in their dorms while they slept. The United Nations has said it wants to try members on war crimes after an attack on a wedding party that killed 30 people. An estimated 8,000 Nigerians have fled to Cameroon to escape the violence, while another 5,000 people have been internally displaced, the United Nations says. Opinion: Should U.S. fear Boko Haram?

"(CNN) -- Now that elder statesman Nelson Mandela has passed on, many are wondering how best to honor him. As the scope and breadth of his work was so wide, the answer to that question is likely different for each of us. Nelson Mandela once said, ""To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity."" With his steadfast conviction to issues of social justice, he is a symbol of the human struggle for justice and equality. Mandela stood up for what he believed in, no matter the cost. He fought against South Africa's apartheid government and ended up imprisoned. After his release, he immediately plunged himself wholeheartedly into the work of improving others' lives. In a 2007 interview, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu said of Mandela, ""How God must love South Africa to have given us such a priceless gift. After 27 years of incarceration when most expected you to emerge consumed by bitterness and resentment, lusting for revenge, you bowled us over with your magnanimity, your nobility and generosity of spirit."" Nelson Mandela called on all people to do something, even something small, to make the world a better place. It seems each of us whose lives have been affected by the many causes he so stoically fought for can honor him by carrying on his work in our own way. Here are some ideas: . GIVE 67 MINUTES . ""Mr Mandela spent 67 years making the world a better place. We're asking you for 67 minutes."" The United Nations officially declared July 18th, Mandela's birthday, as Nelson Mandela International Day in 2009. Mandela Day is a global call to action for people to devote 67 minutes to help others, one minute for every year of Mandela's public service. There are many ways to make a difference, but the key is to devote those 67 minutes to doing good for others. FIGHT RACISM AND BIGOTRY . Mandela spent 27 years in prison because he stood up against apartheid. Human rights and social justice were at the very core of his belief system. To carry on his legacy, teach by example. Take a few minutes to examine prejudices you may have yourself. Make a personal resolution to let go of them. Encourage the people in your life to do the same. Speak out against injustice when you see it. Don't accept prejudice. Learn to recognize bullying and harassment, be it online or in person. Donate your time and share information about how to stop it with your family, friends, school, church and neighbors. A resource that may help you is StopBullying.gov. You can also fight racism and bigotry by supporting organizations committed to social justice, like Mandela's own Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and Amnesty International. HELP INCREASE AIDS/HIV AWARENESS . The plight of HIV and AIDS in Africa and throughout the world was of great concern to Mandela. UNAIDS estimated the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011 as 34 million. More than 23 million of those individuals live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa alone, there are more than 2 million orphans because of HIV/AIDS. Though its mission has since expanded, Mandela's 46664 organization was originally founded as a global HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention campaign. Organizations with similar goals exist throughout the world. Among them: amFAR, ActionAid International, Keep a Child Alive, Elton John AIDS Foundation, International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, and Medecins Sans Frontiers International. Become active in one of these organizations, become informed about AIDS and HIV, and spread your knowledge to others. Ask someone with AIDS/HIV to come speak at your church or school. Sponsor a family living with HIV/AIDS. Volunteer at a hospital in your area to hold babies stricken with HIV/AIDS. You can get started doing that by visiting the American Hospital Directory online to find a hospital near you, and then ask to speak with the hospital's volunteer coordinator. IMPROVE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE . Mandela loved children, and he wanted all the world's young people to have opportunities. In a 2000 interview with CNN's Jim Clancy he said, ""We want every child to have a first-class primary education, and we want the elimination of all preventable diseases in society so that we can say in theory and in practice that we regard our children as the jewels in our society."" Of the more than 2 billion children in the world, 1 billion live in poverty. Nelson Mandela Children's Fund is dedicated to improving the conditions and lives of children and youth. Other organizations dedicated to helping children are UNICEF, Feed the Children and ChildFund International. Donating your money or time to organizations dedicated to the welfare of children, locally or internationally, is a way to uphold the Mandela legacy. Sponsor a child. Groups like Save the Children and World Vision make it easy to do online. Advocate for young people. Donate goods. Toys for Tots makes it easy for you to find a drop-off location near you, and you can call the Salvation Army  at 1-800-SA-TRUCK to schedule a pick-up of your donated goods. PROMOTE LEADERSHIP . Mandela knew that young people hold the key to the future, and he wanted them to have the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential. His Mandela Rhodes Foundation is aimed at helping African youth who show academic prowess and leadership potential by offering them scholarships to further their education and build upon their leadership skills. What can you do? Become involved in an organization with a similar mission such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of America or Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Further, be a role model and become a mentor. MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership can link you to organizations in your area looking for mentors, and it can even show you ways to e-mentor. Consider starting your own scholarship program, and nurture and encourage positive attributes you see in young people. Finally, stand up for what you believe in. Nelson Mandela was a man of conviction. No matter what the cause is that is dear to your heart, stand up for it. Advocate for it, and find ways to inspire others to do the same. That's what Nelson Mandela did. For more on ways to honor Mandela's charitable legacy go to cnn.com/impact.","Nelson Mandela called on everyone to do something to make the world a better place .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Inside a sparkling new pool house off a dusty, bustling street in Afghanistan's capital, sits a young man with a dream. Malek Mohammad, an 18-year-old double amputee, has already overcome so many challenges in his young life, some might be tempted to think he requires no assistance whatsoever. But adversity has made him wise beyond his years, and Malek knows better. His struggle has been a lonely one. ""I need support, I need help because I'm representing Afghanistan -- especially disabled people,"" says Malek, who more than anything, wants to swim for his country at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. Landmines took his legs at age 11 as he was walking through a field near Kabul's airport. It was while he was in the hospital that an American visitor noticed Malek and paid for him to go the United States and get prosthetic limbs made. During his two years recovering there, Malek was encouraged to participate in sports and he learned English. Then he returned to his family in Afghanistan. Malek's younger brother, Samandar, beams with pride as he watches his sibling swim the length of the pool. ""He didn't lose his courage and power. He is very strong, and I am sure that he can take part in any competition. I am sure he will be successful and then the whole world can be proud of him."" At the pool, Malek shows us how athletics turned his life around, using his arms to lift his body off the tiles and then dive into the pool. ""I don't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim, how to prepare for the games, so I'm doing by myself, because I love swimming,"" says Malek. In a country torn apart by far too many years of war, Malek is far from the only athlete facing these types of challenges. Female boxer trains in stadium where Taliban executed women . ""I think the government of Afghanistan has given the Olympic Committee too little assistance and enough attention hasn't been paid to it either,"" says Olympic Committee member Sami Darayi. ""The budget that the government has allocated to the Olympic Committee is almost nothing while we have got more sport federations than a lot of other countries."" To date, Afghanistan has won a medal at the Olympics only once -- at 2008's Beijing games when Rohullah Nikpai won a bronze medal in taekwondo. Nikpai, who was swimming in the same pool as Malek when we visited, is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in Afghanistan. ""I know that we don't have enough resources for sportsman in Afghanistan,"" says Nikpai, ""but the younger generations in this country love sports, so they are making efforts to try and go out of the country for competitions. ""They want to bring medals back home. That is why we are not hesitating and making every possible effort to compete on the worldwide scale."" Malek uses two pools in the city to practice, but neither are Olympic regulation size. When he's not swimming, Malek spends time at the track running and working to stay in shape. The tough regimen is rough on his prosthetic limbs and the tread on the bottom of them are wearing thin. Malik says replacements are impossible to come by in Kabul. Nikpai is very happy to see Malek make progress. ""He is super smart and full of energy. I am really hoping for him to compete in the London Paralympics,"" says Nikpai. ""Because at this point he has no legs but is still trying to serve his country in a way that he thinks he can and that is a very good thing."" Malek has others encouraging him to chase his Olympic dream. Friends and family also find hope in him -- something they say is missing in a country torn apart by far too many years of war. ""I am so happy to see someone like him, who has no legs, still swimming,"" says friend Raza Javed. ""And often, even better than other people on the team."" As Malek waits to find out if he's earned a spot at the games, he remains optimistic. He realizes the odds aren't exactly in his favor, but is sure things are bound to get better. ""I am sure someday I will have some professional trainer, good teacher, good support and [be] representing Afghanistan, and that my job will be to bring some medal for my country."" Malek knows that whatever happens, in a sense, he's already won.","Landmine amputee in training to fulfill Olympic dream .

"(Ars Technica) -- Facebook is still working on deleting photos from its servers in a timely manner nearly three years after Ars first brought attention to the topic. The company admitted on Friday that its older systems for storing uploaded content ""did not always delete images from content delivery networks in a reasonable period of time even though they were immediately removed from the site,"" but said it's currently finishing up a newer system that makes the process much quicker. In the meantime, photos that users thought they ""deleted"" from the social network months or even years ago remain accessible via direct link. The problem: ""deleted"" photos never go away . When we first investigated this phenomenon in 2009, we discovered that photos ""deleted"" from Facebook seemingly never go away if you have a direct link to the image file on Facebook's servers. Users who might have had second thoughts about posting a photo -- whether it was because they didn't want retaliation from an employer, wanted to avoid family drama, or uploaded a photo of a friend without their permission—could certainly remove the image from Facebook's main user interface, but as long as someone had a direct link to the .jpg file in question, the photo would remain accessible for an indefinite amount of time. When we asked Facebook about it, we were told that the company was ""working with our content delivery network (CDN) partner to significantly reduce the amount of time that backup copies persist."" But when we followed up on the story more than a year later, our ""deleted"" photos were still accessible via direct link. That's when the reader stories started pouring in: we were told horror stories about online harassment using photos that were allegedly deleted years ago, and users who were asked to take down photos of friends that they had put online. There were plenty of stories in between as well, and panicked Facebook users continue to e-mail me, asking if we have heard of any new way to ensure that their deleted photos are, well, deleted. For example, one reader linked me to a photo that a friend of his had posted of his toddler crawling naked on the lawn. He asked his friend to take it down for obvious reasons, and so the friend did -- in May of 2008. As of this writing in 2012, I have personally confirmed that the photo is still online, as are several others that readers linked me to that were deleted at various points in 2009 and 2010. (Amusingly, after publishing the 2010 followup, Facebook appeared to delete my photos from its CDN that I had linked in the piece. The company never offered me any explanation, but my photos were the only ones that were deleted at that time. Other ""deleted"" photos that I had saved links to -- ones that weren't from my account and were deleted even earlier than mine—remained online.) It's 2012, and things aren't much different -- yet . After confirming once again that all the photos that my friends and Ars readers had sent in were still online, I reached out to Facebook once again, looking for an answer as to why this is still going on nearly three years after the company first promised it was ""working"" on the issue. ""The systems we used for photo storage a few years ago did not always delete images from content delivery networks in a reasonable period of time even though they were immediately removed from the site,"" Facebook spokesperson Frederic Wolens told Ars via e-mail. Wolens explained that photos remaining online are stuck in a legacy system that was apparently never operating properly, but said the company is working on a new system that will delete the photos in a mere month and a half. For really real this time. ""We have been working hard to move our photo storage to newer systems which do ensure photos are fully deleted within 45 days of the removal request being received,"" Wolens said. ""This process is nearly complete and there is only a very small percentage of user photos still on the old system awaiting migration, the URL you provided was stored on this legacy system. We expect this process to be completed within the next month or two, at which point we will verify the migration is complete and we will disable all the old content."" Long story short, Wolens claims that Facebook is on the verge of fixing up its content systems so that ""deleted"" photos are really, truly deleted from the CDN within 45 days. But with the process not expected to be finished until a couple months from now—and unfortunately, with a company history of stretching the truth when asked about this topic—we'll have to see it before we believe it. It's hard to believe that we've been following this story over a period of years and the problem hasn't been fixed yet. But unlike the past, we do have some semblance of confidence that Facebook might actually be working on it this time. We'll continue to follow this story until the new changes are actually in place. In the meantime, does anyone have any new Facebook horror stories to share? COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM .","Facebook admitted that its older systems f""did not always delete images""

"(CNN) -- British police arrested a 44-year-old man accused of trying to get into London's Buckingham Palace illegally on Monday, authorities said. David Belmar was stopped at the main gate facing the Victoria Memorial, and a search revealed he was carrying a knife, according to Metropolitan Police. He did not gain access to the palace grounds, police said. The man was arrested on suspicion of trespassing on a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon, and remained in custody Monday afternoon, police said. He was later charged with trespassing and possession of a bladed or pointed article. No injuries were reported. Belmar is expected to appear in custody at West London Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Buckingham Palace, the best known of Queen Elizabeth II's palaces, is the administrative center for the royal household as well as the queen's London residence. The incident came more than a month after police said a man scaled a security fence to enter the palace. The man was found inside the palace in an area open to the public during the day, police said. Two men were arrested on that day -- one on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary, the other accused of burglary, trespass and criminal damage. Prince Andrew mistaken for intruder .

"(CNN) -- Please bear with me as I ask you to briefly use your imagination. Close your eyes. Imagine Machu Picchu at dawn cloaked in fog. Now imagine the fog slowly lifting to reveal an enormous ancient city perched on the edge of a mountain. Picture a sense of mystery being immersed in thousands of years of history as you walk between antiquated hewn stone structures. There is tranquility in the wind-blown stillness of the primeval site. You feel a renewed sense of kinship with the past and with your ancestors and feel a deep reverence for their lives and accomplishments. Now imagine the menacing sound of bulldozers closing in and men at work. Their heavy machinery rattles the ground. You hear workers rigging dynamite to these massive stone structures. There is a brief lull and then the deafening blow of multiple explosions as Machu Picchu is razed to the ground. Be at ease, Machu Piccu is a UNESCO protected site. But a very similar 2,600-year-old Buddhist site in Logar province, Afghanistan isn't so lucky. This site is called Mes Aynak and is nothing short of awe-inspiring: a massive walled-in Buddhist city featuring massive temples, monasteries, and thousands of Buddhist statues that managed to survive looters and the Taliban. Holding a key position on the Silk Road, Mes Aynak was also an international hub for traders and pilgrims from all over Asia. Hundreds of fragile manuscripts detailing daily life at the site are still yet to be excavated. Beneath the Buddhist dwellings is an even older yet-unearthed Bronze age site indicated by several recent archaeological findings. Mes Aynak is set for destruction at the end of December 2012. All of the temples, monasteries, statues as well as the Bronze age material will all be destroyed by a Chinese government-owned company called China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC). Six villages and the mountain range will also be destroyed to create a massive open-pit style copper mine. In 2007, MCC outbid competitors with a $3 billion bid to lease the area for 30 years. MCC plans to extract over $100 billion worth of copper located directly beneath the Buddhist site. Ironically, the Buddhists were also mining for copper albeit in a more primitive fashion. MCC says they weren't told about the archaeology site's existence until after the contract was signed. Following significant international pressure and perhaps sensing an impending PR nightmare, MCC in 2009 gave archaeologists three years to attempt to excavate the site. Archaeologists say they need at least 30 years to do the job but had no choice but to accept MCCs brief timetable. Specialists on site are working with extremely limited funding and the crudest of tools. Afghan archaeologists, who do the majority of the excavation, don't have access to computers or digital cameras and have been sleeping on the floor in a wooden shack when staying on the site overnight. Today, three teams of international archaeologists led by DAFA, a French archaeological delegation, scramble to save as many relics as they can. These experts are performing rushed rescue archeology, which focuses on removing movable objects and not on preserving structures. Archaeologists now have less than four months to do three decades worth of excavation. They are also risking their lives daily as locals of Logar Province, angry at the loss of their villages partner with the Taliban to regularly attack both the MCC site and the archaeology location with rockets and land mines. In July, a Logar worker unearthed a landmine that exploded in his face. Later that month, four Afghan policemen were killed by a landmine on the road leading to the archaeology site. I am often asked, ""Why save it? It is, after all, just another remnant of the past, right?"" Wrong. Mes Aynak is the missing link that shows Afghanistan's interconnectivity throughout Asia on the Silk Road. Afghanistan needs to see the value of learning its own cultural history as too often the country's story is co-opted by the lens of another. Afghans need to claim their cultural significance in the world for current and new generations. And the findings at Mes Aynak will be the key to doing that. In addition to Mes Aynak's historical significance, the site is breathtaking to behold in person. I can't help but feel privileged and honored to have been able to set foot inside its ancient walls, to have been able to bare witness to massive Buddhas, many of which are still coated in gold paint overlooking their ancient city. These statues have miraculously survived looting, survived the intense heat and cold, and survived over three decades of continuous war. There is a magic to Mes Aynak -- an ability to draw in people from around the world who will risk their lives to save it. I fell in love with this ancient site and will do everything in my power to try to help save it. It sickens me to know that in a short time this site will be destroyed in the same violent and disrespectful way the Buddha of Bamyan was destroyed. This desecration shows no reverence to culture or religion. Imagine someone bulldozing your grandparents' graves and blowing up their cemetery. How could the world look away letting such crime happen in the name of capitalism? Unfortunately, Mes Aynak has gained some powerful enemies. MCC, The World Bank and Afghan ministries all want mining to start ASAP. In my opinion, they want Mes Aynak to set a precedent -- to be a model for resource extraction of the one trillion dollars plus of valuable minerals like oil, copper, lithium and iron buried underneath Afghanistan. According to archaeologists that I spoke with, every mining location holds cultural heritage. On every potential mine lies an ancient site like Mes Aynak. So, even worse than the senseless destruction of Mes Aynak, is the thought that this kind of cheap destructive process will be replicated all across Afghanistan. I often hear talk about mineral extraction being somehow good for Afghanistan, but I promise you this is not the case. Given the country's out of control corruption there are a privileged few who will see any payout from such endeavors. Afghan citizens have absolutely nothing to gain from this copper mine or any other international extractive industry. I believe Chinese will bring in their own laborers to manage the mine and Afghans will be given only low level and terribly paid positions working in slave-like conditions. And I have said nothing about the environmental devastation. Many mining experts have told me the toxic pollution from the mine will likely turn Mes Aynak into a site so toxic that in the future people will be advised against even setting foot on the ground. They tell me this pollution will be permanent, rivers will be polluted and the toxins will travel to other areas -- and the locals have never been educated about these risks to the area. So not only will Afghanistan lose an ancient site, a key to unlocking its important history, but the country will lose the land and everything living on it. And what happens when Afghanistan needs copper or oil or iron for its own development? Will they have to buy it back from China at inflated rates? My fear is that in the future Afghanistan will consist of hundreds of these gaping toxic craters and the resources the country needs for its own development will be lost. Afghans will see no benefit. They will suffer from irreversible environmental devastation and the permanent loss of invaluable cultural heritage. So as a final request I want you to close your eyes once again. Imagine a city-sized toxic crater in the ground where the majestic Machu Picchu once stood. That sight, unfortunately, is the future of Mes Aynak unless we do something to stop it.","Huffman says the ancient site will be destroyed by plans to mine the area .

"Editor's note: This is part of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming, six-hour television event, ""God's Warriors,"" hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Gehad al-Khalek of Egypt says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty. (CNN) -- Last year at Christmastime, Rehan Seyam, a Muslim living in New Jersey, went to pick up some things at a local Wal-Mart. Seeing her distinctive traditional Muslim head covering called a ""hijab,"" a man in the store, addressing her directly, sang ""The 12 Days of Christmas"" using insulting lyrics about terrorism and Osama bin Laden. She was stunned. ""Do I look like a terrorist to you?"" Seyam said she asked the man. According to Seyam, the man replied, ""What else does a terrorist look like?"" Such stories are not altogether uncommon for Muslim Americans. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of Muslims living in America said it has become more difficult to be a Muslim in the United States since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Fifty-one percent said they are ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" that women wearing the hijab are treated poorly, according to the poll. A simple headscarf generally used by women to hide the hair from view, the hijab has become so controversial among some that several countries have banned or considered banning Muslim women from wearing them in public places. In light of this contentiousness, why do Muslim women choose to wear the hijab?  Watch the making of CNN's TV special ""God's Warriors"" » . Gehad al-Khalek lives in Egypt and says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty. ""I want to shift the attention from my outer self to my inner self when I deal with someone, I don't want them to look at me in a way that wouldn't suit me,"" she told CNN in an upcoming documentary called ""God's Warriors."" Al-Khalek is fluent in English and German; studied in Europe; plays Western music on her guitar; and spent time working for a women's rights organization. She wears the hijab -- and says it's not just for religious reasons. ""My own conclusion was it is debatable whether it is a religious obligation or not, but I chose to keep it on because I do believe in modesty and you shouldn't be showing off yourself,"" al-Khalek said. The Quran calls for women to be modest in their dress but interpretation of the edict varies widely, according to religious experts who spoke with CNN. An author who has written widely on Islam told CNN the Quran does not require women to wear the hijab. ""There's nothing in the Quran about all women having to be veiled or secluded in a certain part of the house. That came in later [after Prophet Mohammed's time],"" said religious historian and author Karen Armstrong. For Seyam, the hijab is a religious duty. ""It's God's wish,"" she said. ""It's a requirement by God. He wants us to cover. He wants us to be modest,"" Seyam said. But as important as the hijab is to her, Seyam's decision to cover her hair wasn't one she made easily. ""It was very dramatic for me. And I remember, even now thinking about it, it really does make my heart beat a little bit faster,"" she said, ""I was making a decision I knew was permanent. You put on hijab, you don't take it off."" Through her childhood growing up in Long Island, New York, Seyam prayed with her devout Muslim parents, but says she was just ""going through the motions."" It wasn't until college that she decided to wear a hijab consistently. Influenced by her more devout friends, Seyam decided being a good Muslim meant covering her head. ""My sole purpose is to be here for the sake of Allah, and I'm doing something that he specifically says that you should be doing."" Seyam said there were practical factors in her decision as well. ""I'm sick of guys catcalling. It was just driving me crazy. I felt like a piece of meat."" But Seyam says she traded in catcalling for a different kind of negative attention. People ""look at me as if I am threatening and I do not feel like I am threatening looking. I don't feel I should instill fear in anybody's heart, but I do feel like I get dirty looks,"" she said. Still, Seyam says her faith sustains her and that wearing the hijab is an important part of that faith. ""I'm not here to live my life and do whatever I want. I'm here to worship God,"" Seyam said.

"(CNN) -- The press has turned on President Obama with a vengeance. Suddenly, the White House briefing room is filled with confrontational questions. Suddenly, the news pages are ablaze with scandal, and the commentators -- even some of the president's usual defenders -- are bemoaning his shortcomings. Suddenly, Obama isn't getting the benefit of the doubt. According to Obama's longtime detractors, the denizens of the fourth estate are finally climbing out of a tank in which they have been immersed since roughly 2007. But the reality is a bit more nuanced than that. There are a number of unsavory allegations swirling around Washington, but do not underestimate the importance of the Justice Department seizing two months of Associated Press phone records without so much as a heads-up. This not only seems like a case of prosecutorial overreach, even in a case involving national security, it strikes at the heart of what journalists do -- and has fostered feelings of betrayal. Does the administration not understand the chilling effect on reporters and their sources, they wonder, or simply not care? It's easy to say that news organizations recoiled from Obama only when their own special interests were threatened, and maybe there's some truth to that. But the media also have a deep, abiding love for scandal, and beyond the AP phone records story, the administration is lately providing that scandal in spades. The battle over Benghazi has mostly divided along partisan lines, with conservatives seeing a sustained coverup and liberals perceiving a partisan attack on what was a bungled operation and confused aftermath. But the report by ABC's Jonathan Karl alleging the scrubbing of the Susan Rice talking points (following a less-noticed report by Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard) transformed the tone of the coverage in a single stroke. The Karl report turned out to be based on an inaccurate, misleading characterization of an email, but for the first time, many journalists came to believe the administration had something to hideâ€”and that they had been personally misled in press briefings. That is guaranteed to get the blood flowing. The disclosure that the IRS selectively targeted conservative groups for review brought immediate condemnation from many across the media spectrum, including Carl Bernstein, who investigated the Nixonian abuses, of which this story carries an unmistakable echo. And it is the trifecta of these scandalous sagas that will dominate coverage for months as media outlets feast on the cycle of investigations, hearings, subpoenas, resignations and denials. Any doubt that scandal trumps ideology in the media firmament can be dispelled with a glance back at Bill Clinton's tenure, when what he called the ""knee-jerk liberal press"" investigated Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater and other allegations with a fervor that eventually put it on a virtual war footing against the White House. More troubling for the current crew is that news outlets are starting to pivot to broader questions about whether Obama is competent at the business of government or a passive bystander in his own administration. That impression, if it takes hold, cannot be Etch-a-Sketched away. To be sure, some of Obama's antagonists will overreach by framing every scandal as the next Watergate and each revelation as an impeachable offense. That may trigger a counter-reaction in which some of the president's liberal allies shift their focus from the administration's missteps to the opposition's overkill. Some in the media rolled over for Barack Obama in the 2008 campaign, though the record was decidedly more mixed once he took office. But personal feelings toward this president who has never courted the press no longer matter; nor do personal predilections on gun control and immigration reform. The scandal machinery has kicked into high gear, and its sheer noise may drown out everything else. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: AP phone records search, other stories have turned press on Obama .

"(Time.com) -- There are lots of experts who have lots of opinions about New York City's new plan to encourage breast-feeding in new moms by urging hospitals not to give them baby formula. Advocates praise the move as a way to limit the influence of formula manufacturers on new mothers. Skeptics wonder whether the policy will shame women who choose not to breast-feed. As for my sister-in-law, Rachel, who recently gave birth in a Manhattan hospital to her first child, she knows first-hand how nurses pushing formula can impact an inexperienced mother. After her C-section, a nurse offered to give her newborn a bottle ""to make it easier on you."" Exhausted and uncertain, she agreed — even though she'd intended to breast-feed. ""I was a new mom,"" she said. ""I didn't know what I was doing."" Those are exactly the sorts of moms that Mayor Michael Bloomberg hopes to influence with his voluntary Latch On NYC initiative. When it goes into effect in September, nurses in participating hospitals will be instructed not to give formula to babies unless there's a medical reason to do so or unless moms specifically request it (they'll first have to listen to a mandatory speech about why breast is best). Formula will be locked away like medication, and staff will be required to sign it out, track its distribution and report those figures to the Health Department, which presumably wants to know whether the new policy will cut formula use citywide. Twenty-seven of the city's 40 hospitals have agreed to participate. Time.com: What Mitt Romney has to do with breast-feeding and infant formula . Sound extreme? Not to Melissa Bartick, an internist who is on the board of the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee. ""I can't even get an alcohol wipe without swiping my badge,"" says Bartick. ""Hospitals lock up just about everything from Band-Aids to gauze. The question we should be asking is, why aren't they locking up formula? The reason is because they get it for free."" Typically, formula manufacturers stock hospitals with free samples of their products to encourage brand-name adoption. Many hospitals across the country still give away diaper bags packed with formula samples to new moms, despite increasing awareness that the practice may stymie breast-feeding. Moms need more support to breast-feed exclusively . That practice is changing, though: many hospitals nationwide have voluntarily banned the bags, and in July, Massachusetts became the second state to go ""bag-free,"" with all 49 of its maternity hospitals pledging to spurn the formula freebies. (Rhode Island was first in 2011.) The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises moms to breast-feed exclusively for about six months, then continue breast-feeding while offering new foods. In July, an annual gathering of state AAP leaders voted to support a resolution entitled ""Divesting from Formula Marketing in Pediatric Care"" that would call on pediatricians ""not to provide formula company gift bags, coupons and industry-authored handouts to the parents of newborns and infants in office and clinic settings."" The resolution, which now must be considered by the academy's board of directors, is proving controversial as it demands the organization decide how far to push its support of breast-feeding. ""We're not going to argue about the benefits of breast-feeding because we all know that,"" says AAP President Dr. Robert Block, who has two adopted daughters who relied on formula. ""We stop short of saying if you don't breast-feed, you're a terrible mother. ""There are a lot of babies who need to be formula-fed. Breast-feeding advocates would disagree with this. They say any baby can be breast-fed by any mother. But there are legitimate reasons for babies to need formula."" Time.com: Can a formula company really promote breast-feeding and fight child obesity? But there are also ""booby traps"" — what breast-feeding advocacy group Best for Babes terms the obstacles keeping women from breast-feeding success. Those include lack of support from employers, communities, hospitals and doctors who care for moms and babies. Pediatricians, suggests Best for Babes, should take continuing education courses on the basics of lactation management. ""Pediatricians need to be as proficient in this area as they are in diagnosing a heart murmur, pneumonia or the common flu,"" wrote Best for Babes co-founder Bettina Forbes in an e-mail. Opinion: Breast-feeding is intuitive and easy? No! In New York City, 90% of moms start out breast-feeding, but more than two-thirds stop or incorporate infant formula by two months. To try to shift that number, Latch On NYC is rolling out a full complement of subway ads, with three posters comparing formula (unfavorably) to breast milk, and featuring a racial cross-section of mothers. A press release about the campaign explains the relationship between formula and breast-feeding success: . If the baby is not given anything but breast milk, especially in the first month after the baby is born, almost every mother will make enough milk for her baby. Using baby formula during this time can decrease the production of milk, and consequently make the mother reliant on formula. Time.com: What the U.S. can learn from Indonesia about breast-feeding . But the International Formula Council — which represents formula manufacturers and marketers — maintains that restricting access to formula isn't the key to boosting breast-feeding rates. ""A way to help mothers is to be supportive of the feeding choice they make for their infants regardless if they choose breast-feeding, formula feeding or a combination of both,"" Mardi Mountford, the council's executive vice president, wrote in an e-mail. ""For infants who are not breast-fed, infant formula is the only safe, nutritious and recommended feeding option."" Mountford is right, of course, about formula being the only widely available alternative to breast milk (there's donor milk too, though not enough to nourish all formula-fed babies). She's right too about the need to support a mom's choice. But she's not necessarily right when she says that limiting formula doesn't impact breast-feeding rates. NYU Langone Medical Center, which has already restricted access to formula, has seen its breast-feeding rate increase from 39% to 68% by doing so. ""New York City is definitely ahead of the curve,"" Eileen DiFrisco, a parent education coordinator in the hospital's mother-baby unit, told the New York Post. In my sister-in-law's experience — and in the experience of dozens of mothers who shared their stories of feeling undermined when they were offered formula in the hospital — New York City's policy seems to make sense. Time.com: Moms say it's hard to breast-feed for the recommended six months . It does to Stephanie Rodriguez, who had read what felt like every breast-feeding book imaginable in preparation for her daughter's arrival. ""I was ready,"" wrote Rodriguez in an e-mail. But then her daughter had a hard time latching on and instead of offering help, a nurse offered formula; Rodriguez took it. She kept working at breast-feeding and things improved, so they went home — free formula gift bag in tow. At home, ""feeling alone and confused,"" Rodriguez gave her daughter some of the free formula. ""My daughter had serious nipple confusion after that and the hospital bottles, and it took several weeks of hard, time-consuming work and dedication ... to get her to take the breast again."" Rodriguez has since become a board-certified lactation consultant in Missouri, inspired by her personal struggle to feed her child. ""In my work, I regularly see clients that tell me that they weren't going to give bottles, but, you know, that can was there and it seemed like it would be easier. ... It's a real problem that is keeping moms from attaining their own breastfeeding goals,"" says Rodriguez. ""It's not the entire issue, but it certainly doesn't help.""

"New York (CNN) -- The mother of two would often drive back and forth between her suburban Scarsdale, New York, home and the bleak-looking, one-story brick warehouse in Queens. Sometimes, she drove the route in her Mercedes SUV. She probably thought about her girls, 3 and 13. Maybe she was thinking of the horseback riding lessons with her teenager, and the new horse they were hoping to buy. One thing perhaps not on her mind was being arrested and accused of living a double life: as a suburban mom and also as head of a multimillion-dollar marijuana growing operation. She faces federal narcotics charges. Federal authorities say Andrea Sanderlin, 45, ran the marijuana operation from the warehouse, where they found two rooms packed with more than 1,000 marijuana plants and large amounts of dried marijuana, along with state-of-the-art lighting, irrigation, and ventilation systems to facilitate the hydroponic growing of the plants, according to court documents. ""The warehouse was filled with over $3 million worth of hydroponic marijuana and the organization covertly produced 3,000 marijuana plants,"" Brian Crowell, special agent in charge at the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in a statement Tuesday. When agents raided Sanderlin's home on May 20, they found books on how to grow marijuana and how to launder money, according to the DEA. Mexican judge found video compelling in case of detained U.S. mom, marijuana . Details of Sanderlin's involvement in the case were first reported by The Smoking Gun website. Sanderlin was arrested the same day, after agents followed her to the warehouse and entered on a warrant, court documents say. She is charged with narcotics trafficking, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. Sanderlin has pleaded not guilty and remains in custody pending a bond hearing. She is a ""full-time mom,"" attorney Joel Winograd said of his client, and added she is ""very concerned"" about her girls. Originally from Virginia, Sanderlin was living in the upscale neighborhood of Scarsdale and driving a 2010 Mercedes SUV. According to court documents, she also had a 2004 Jeep Liberty and a 2005 Chevrolet van registered in her name. Sanderlin had recently picked up the sport of horseback riding and took lessons with her teenage daughter at Twin Lakes Farm, a riding academy and competitive show stable in Bronxville, according to owner Scott Tarter. Opinion: Why marijuana should be legal for adults . Tarter described Sanderlin as a ""beginner adult rider"" who came to the academy in January after buying a Friesian horse for recreational riding. Tarter said on Tuesday that Sanderlin seemed like a normal, caring, local mother who boarded her horse at his stables. Tarter said he thought Sanderlin was in the interior design business. ""She was just like all the local moms here,"" he said. ""She wasn't loud. I never saw her smoking or drinking or anything that would have made me believe this."" Sanderlin participated in small horse shows at Twin Lakes, but decided to sell her horse in April. Tarter said they had planned to start looking for a new horse for Sanderlin but he hadn't seen her or her daughter since late May. Illinois, Ohio take up medical marijuana laws . Authorities said a confidential witness tipped them off to Sanderlin's alleged crimes. The witness, who has been charged with participating in a conspiracy to possess and distribute marijuana, told investigators in April that a person named ""Andi"" operated at least one marijuana grow house in Brooklyn or Queens, according to court documents. The witness also said ""Andi"" lived in Scarsdale and drove a Mercedes SUV, officials said. Later, when shown a picture of Andrea Sanderlin, the witness positively identified Sanderlin as ""Andi."" Law enforcement agents said they contacted Con Edison about electricity accounts under Sanderlin's name. The electricity company told them about an account connected to Sanderlin's telephone number in the name of ""Fantastic Enterprises"" in Queens, at a location that was using ""an unusually high amount of electricity."" Con Edison also said bills for the account were paid in cash. Officials found that Fantastic Enterprises was a registered New York corporation from 2007 to 2011 and that the address provided for the business was an address listed under Sanderlin's name in insurance claims.

"(CNN) -- Newt Gingrich quit the presidential race on Wednesday. Long after he exhausted the patience of the voters, he finally concluded that the mathematical probability of winning the Republican nomination was next to nil. Why spend money and raise false hopes if you can't win? Best to get out now and join the veepstakes. That's the kind of logic that an ordinary, candidate-focused campaign employs. Ron Paul, on the other hand, refuses to drop out. Commanding a plurality of delegates in only one state, and having taken just 10.61 percent nationally so far, it could be argued that the 76-year-old libertarian has even less reason to carry on than Gingrich -- except perhaps to collect the air miles. However, unlike Gingrich, Paul's campaign represents a message that is bigger and perhaps more popular than the candidate himself. As it continues to collect small numbers of delegates and capture control of local GOPs, Paulism is proving itself to be in rude health. Long after Mitt Romney is nominated, feted at the convention, beaten by Obama and recycled as a question on Jeopardy (""In 2012, he lost every state but Utah."" ""Who is ... Britt Gormley?""), Paul's philosophy will still be a factor in national politics -- something to be feared and courted in equal measure. Team Paul has certainly made some big errors this year, such as exclusively focusing on Iowa and New Hampshire. Although he did well in both, only a first in either would have really justified the expense. Thereafter, the campaign unwisely ignored South Carolina and Florida, reasoning that their expensive media markets weren't worth the effort. As a consequence, Paul was ignored for weeks until Nevada. I am informed by Paul sources that their campaign was counting on Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum to drop out after they realized they couldn't win, which would have allowed Ron Paul to emerge as the only conservative challenger to Romney. Of course, that's not what happened. Strategy aside, the candidate had his faults, too. I have to declare a great deal of affection for Paul. Unlike other politicians, he seems motivated by ideas -- and he communicates his passion with the zeal of a nutty professor detailing the thrilling possibilities of quasars and black holes. This is a doctor who refused to accept Medicare payments but lowered his prices for patients who couldn't afford him, who declined a government pension and never voted for a tax increase, who told Republicans they need to end the War on Drugs (and most other wars, too). He's pure. But Paul has also been around a long time and is starting to look like a perennial candidate. His emphasis upon a noninterventionist foreign policy might be what attracted so many activists and donations, but it has also contributed to the sense that he is a marginal candidate. There simply aren't enough anti-war conservatives within the Republican Party to justify the energy that Paul generates around the issue, while the GOP brand is too toxic to attract enough crossover anti-war liberals into the primaries to turn him into a contender. Ann Coulter's remark that ""I love Ron Paul on everything but Iraq,"" is a good summary of his problem: While Paul's platform is attractive to many conservatives, he remains solely identified by his opposition to the war on terror. Nevertheless, Paul's 2012 candidacy has had certain hidden successes. Aside from all the money he raised, Ron Paul also attracted an unusual coalition of young people, libertarian Republicans, and disaffected Democrats -- a coalition large enough for him to run even with Obama in some polls. The pull among the kids was big enough to fuel talk of a new generational voting bloc. In Iowa, he took 48% of the under-30s, compared with Santorum's 23% and Romney's 14%. In New Hampshire, he got 47%, while Romney took just 26%. There was a problem, however. In Virginia (the only state that was a straightforward Paul vs Romney vote), Paul's vote was overwhelmingly young but not orthodox Republican in its views. His supporters were more inclined to be pro-choice on abortion, nonevangelical, and opposed to the tea party. Given that Paul is pro-life, religious, and wildly supportive of the tea party, this confirms the growing tension between the man and his movement. In the future, a Paulite candidate might do better by running third party on a more socially tolerant platform. Young people seem to like their libertarianism to be socially tolerant as well as fiscally prudent. Within the GOP, the Paulites are still the unbeaten masters of the administrative procedure. Last Saturday, they swept a confusing ballot process in Louisiana to give themselves control of 70% of delegates attending the state's nominating convention, which could mean they end up numerically ""winning"" Louisiana. Similar things have happened in Minnesota and even Romney's home state of Massachusetts. Combine this administrative brilliance with generational politics and you get a silent grass-roots revolution that is putting many Paulites in positions of power. In 2010, more than a dozen of them won elections as Republicans, including Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan and Sen. Rand Paul (son of Ron) of Kentucky. This year, two dozen active Paul backers are seeking election to Congress, along with more than 200 running for local office. The Paulites have effectively taken over the Iowa GOP. The state central committee now has six members who are passionate for Paul, and the head of the local party is now a Paulite. Given the importance of Iowa to the 2016 nomination, this is a coup in every sense. All of this means the GOP can no longer ignore its libertarian ""fringe."" On the contrary, it will have to reach out to a new generation of activists who don't regard religious piety or continual warfare as sacred tenets of conservatism. Even Romney will have to take Sarah Palin's advice not to ""marginalize"" the Paulites if he is to emerge from the nominating convention with a united party. Whatever happens in 2012, we are living through a significant moment in the history of conservatism. The age of Bush and Obama -- twin specters of lavish spending and imperial design -- have birthed anti-government movements of right (tea party) and left (Occupy). The one that will last longest and have the most impact is the one that has been the most pragmatic and politically savvy. The Ron Paul revolution won't stop here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley says Ron Paul has gained influence, if not a nomination .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Americans were enthralled by fake reports of an alien invasion in the Orson Welles ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast on Halloween Eve in 1938. Hundreds of science fiction movies from the 1902 silent epic ""A Trip to the Moon"" (featured in the current film ""Hugo"") to ""Star Wars"" to this year's ""Cowboys and Aliens"" have fed a deep curiosity about intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe. Hang on to your hats, because reality is starting to catch up. On Tuesday, scientists reported evidence from the Kepler satellite that two Earth-sized planets are orbiting a nearby star about 1,000 light years from earth -- practically our back yard compared to the extent of our Milky Galaxy, but far too distant to visit with current spacecraft. These planets, named Kepler 20-e and Kepler 20-f, have sizes and masses similar to the Earth, and their host star is similar to our sun. But the resemblance ends there. Both orbit very rapidly -- in 6.1 days and 19.6 days, respectively, compared to 365 days for an Earth year -- so both are much closer to their star than the Earth is to the sun. This makes both planets way too hot to support life as we know it. Still, the pace of planet discovery is astonishing. Sometime in the next few years, scientists will likely discover Earth-like planets that are capable of supporting life. Our sun is just one star among the hundreds of billions that make up the Milky Way galaxy, which itself is only one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. Over the last 15 years, astronomers have found hundreds of planets orbiting stars in our corner of the Milky Way and the list will pass 1,000 next year. Planets are plentiful. Discoveries of planets are limited only by the capabilities of current telescopes and instruments and by the time needed to sample several full orbits of a planet around its host star. Most ""extra-solar planets"" (or ""exoplanets"") have been found by measuring tiny Doppler shifts (wavelength shifts) in the light of the host star. With this method it is easier to find heavy planets than light ones, and easier to find planets in close rather than distant orbits. So most of the planets found so far are big ones, similar to Jupiter or Neptune in our solar system, only orbiting much, much closer than the Earth to their host star. This is kind of like surveying your neighborhood for sumo wrestlers: You find far fewer than the number of other people who live there, and way fewer than the population of the world. So the 716 known exoplanets are just the tip of the iceberg. The Kepler satellite uses a different method, based on transits of planets across the face of their host star. Visible light from the star dims very slightly, typically by 0.01% or less for an Earth-sized planet passing in front. Thus Kepler finds planets regardless of mass, although it more easily sees large planets (which cover more of the star's surface and thus diminish the light more) and it only sees planets that cross the star as seen from the Earth (which most planets don't). By the way, you can help make these discoveries. At www.planethunters.org, a citizen science project started by colleagues of mine at Yale, anyone can search the Kepler data for signs of new planets. In particular, users might find unusual systems that the Kepler computer algorithms don't search for. (For a fun Christmas holiday interpretation of the Kepler plots of star brightness over time, see this video.) ""Life"" can mean anything from single-celled organisms to a walking, talking homo sapiens, or possibly something much stranger. For now, scientists are focusing on conventional carbon-based life because its signatures are well known. Such life requires liquid water, meaning a temperature between freezing (32 F) and boiling (212 F). Planets too close to their star will be too hot, like the sweltering surface of Venus, which approaches the 800 degree Fahrenheit temperature of Kepler 20-f. Planets too far away have frigid surfaces, like Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Temperatures that allow water to be liquid define the so-called ""habitable zone"" -- like Goldilocks' favorite porridge, planets in the habitable zone are not too hot, not too cold, but just right for life. We haven't yet found definitive signs of life elsewhere in the universe. But we can estimate that even the narrowest case of carbon-based life on an Earth-like planet orbiting a sun-like star in the habitable zone is likely, because planets are probably common around such stars, sun-like stars are common in our galaxy, and our galaxy is similar to many throughout the universe. We also know the building blocks of life -- amino acids and other organic compounds -- form naturally from carbon, water and energy, as the chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey first showed more than 50 years ago. Sadly, although life is likely to exist on exoplanets throughout our Milky Way galaxy, intelligent life is another thing altogether. Humans have lived at most a few hundred thousand years out of the Earth's 4.6 billion year history -- or less than 0.006% of the available time. In contrast, simple single-celled organisms probably formed several billion years ago, and thus have populated the Earth for more than three-quarters of its existence. This means it is overwhelmingly likely that the life we find elsewhere will be extremely primitive. Face it: We're not going to be IM'ing with aliens, nor should we expect an invasion or a rendezvous in outer space. For now, we're just looking for cells breathing and multiplying. Not ""Another Earth"" -- more like ""The Blob"" (or, ""The Green Slime"").

"(CNN) -- The nation's news media are sure to cover the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School extensively on Saturday. But for the most part, these news organizations say they will acquiesce to the requests of local community members and not report from Newtown, Connecticut, the town where Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished school on December 14, 2012. The massacre was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. CNN said in a statement that while it ""plans to cover the one-year anniversary across our networks and platforms, we are respecting the wishes of the families, and we are not reporting from Newtown on Saturday."" Similarly, an NBC spokeswoman said in an e-mail that ""NBC News is respecting the town's wishes and our broadcasts have no plans to be in Newtown for the anniversary."" Other television networks issued almost identical statements when contacted. Such decisions are exceptionally rare for news organizations and underline the tension between the necessity of covering tragedy and respecting the people who are being covered -- in this case, parents with dead children and their neighbors. What really makes schools safer? In the run-up to the anniversary, Newtown officials said they hoped the press would not descend on the small town, stirring debate about what reporters should and should not do. ""We are wishing fervently that those many persons who wish us well, and the media, will allow us this time to be alone and quiet with time for personal and communal reflection,"" said Pat Llodra, the town's first selectman, a role similar to that of mayor. But the job of journalists is, at times, to document such reflection and share it with the public. The Associated Press said it will provide ""respectful coverage"" of the anniversary Saturday, ""as we have since Day One of Newtown's tragedy."" ""As a news cooperative, owned by some 1,400 daily newspapers across the country, and as a provider of news and information to hundreds of other customers worldwide, AP also recognizes its obligation to report on how Newtown is coming together to mourn and heal,"" a spokesman for the news organization said. Many news organizations visited Newtown ahead of the anniversary to conduct reporting to televise and publish on Saturday. CBS News was among those, and the network signaled this week it would not have a camera crew in the town Saturday. ""We are sensitive to the families' concerns and will cover the anniversary in the least intrusive way possible,"" said Tim Gaughan, director of special events for CBS News. Newtown residents plead for privacy . Newspaper and online journalists are generally able to maintain low profiles on sensitive assignments, with notebooks and cell phones the only necessary tools of the trade.

"(CNN) -- An engineering firm has unveiled plans to turn the Eiffel Tower into a vast, tree-like monument by cladding its mesh iron body in over 600,000 plants. The controversial proposal from Ginger -- a French company that specializes in ecological design projects -- would cost $97 million and remove 87.8 tons of carbon dioxide from the Paris skies, according to the company's calculations. Ginger CEO Jean-Luc Schonebelen concedes that it is probably not the most efficient form of carbon sequestration, but says the idea -- which has so far received no official endorsement from Paris City Council -- could have profound symbolic value. ""We're told that within the next 30 years the world's population may reach nine billion, and that 80% of us will live in cities,"" says Schonebelen, referring to projections from the U.N. Population Division released earlier this year. ""With this in mind, we need to think about how we're going to start bringing nature back into the city landscape ... so this (proposal) is our call for action."" If Schonebelen has his way, thousands of hemp sacks brimming with soil and 48 varieties of seedlings would be fastened to ""La dame de fer"" -- or ""the iron lady,"" the tower's French nickname -- by the end of next year. Irrigated via a 12-ton grid of interconnected rubbing tubing, the plants would likely mature by 2014 and would be nurtured until their removal two years later. ""Of course we're not suggesting this be a permanent fixture, we're proposing this as a temporary installation -- just as Mr Eiffel did when he built the tower back in the 19th century,"" says Schonebelen. Staff at Ginger have been developing the mechanics behind the proposal for the past 18 months. The company employs over 1,500 people and has a turnover of â‚¬230 million a year, according to Schonebelen. Comment: Would you give them your support? Is the Ginger's Eiffel Tower tree a feasible innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream? Tell us you thoughts in the comments section below. Since the Eiffel Tower opened during the 1889 World Fair, the 324-meter tall lattice monument has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, with almost seven million paying visitors a year, according to La Societe d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel. Parisians are quick to defend their city's architectural heritage but says Schonebelen, ""they are also very concerned about the environment and I'm sure will come around to the idea."" Adorned in its new coat of living greenery, the tower would likely become a convenient new home for insects and birds. Schonebelen says they would be welcome guests and insists neither the foliage nor its accompanying inhabitants would obscure the view. ""We'd keep the viewing platforms clear,"" he says. ""Our objective is to enhance the structure, not ruin it. We want to turn an emblem of the industrial past into a beacon of the sustainable future."" Schonebelen says that they have selected a variety of plants that can flourish at high altitude and will be performing a feasibility study in the coming week to test if the tower could withstand the significant additional load. However, the company is yet to formally present its ideas to either the Paris City Council or SETE. ""This is a very serious proposal, from a serious company that has put a lot of time and resources into it,"" says Schonebelen. ""We hope the Paris authorities will give us some of their time to listen to the idea.""

"Madrid (CNN) -- A Madrid street cleaners strike that has left trash piling up for two weeks appears headed for a pivotal point on Saturday, when city hall aims to enforce minimum trash pickup services by using national -- not municipal -- workers, city and union representatives said. Pressure has been building on Mayor Ana Botella from hotel and shop owners, who have been outspoken in saying the strike is hurting the city's image and their businesses, and from neighborhood associations who complain that trash and broken glass are littering the streets. The human cost of Spain's financial crisis . About the only respite for the Spanish capital has been that workers who pick up garbage from homes and restaurants are not on strike. But the street cleaners are very much on strike, so that trash receptacles on the street are overflowing, especially the large bins for glass and paper recycling. And the autumn leaves aren't being swept up either. Peruvian businessman Jack Falcon was visiting the emblematic Plaza Mayor this week and told CNN, ""It's impossible not to notice it. It's very sad. The city looks absolutely dirty."" His wife, Raquel, added, ""It looks horrible ... everywhere you walk."" There are concerns about potential health hazards. The city says it has not reached that point but is monitoring the situation closely. Six thousand street and parks cleaners went on strike on November 5, after three large private services companies that share the city concession for street cleaning announced 1,134 job cuts -- an 18% reduction of the workforce -- and threatened salary reductions for those remaining. Mayor Botella initially said that since these services are outsourced, it was up to those companies and the workers' unions to resolve the issue. Minimum services were stipulated: that 40% of the normal cleanup would occur on the streets, and 25% in the parks. But that's not happening, and the few cleaning crews that are working -- in the city's main tourist areas -- do so under police protection. Companies blame union pickets for the lack of minimum services but the unions blame the companies. Spain turning back the clock on siestas . ""The situation will get worse if the strike continues,"" the Madrid shop owners association said in a prepared statement, ""because we're just ahead of the Christmas holidays, a sales period that is vital for stores."" On November 13, Botella announced a 48-hour deadline, warning that minimum services would have to be carried out or the city would impose them, using workers from a company that's part of the national Ministry of Agriculture. But unions representing the Agriculture Ministry cleaning workers, from a company called Tragsa, issued a statement saying they wouldn't comply because they also are facing sharp job cuts. Spain's unemployment rate climbs to record high . The street cleaners strike is another example of how hard it is for Spain to get out of its long economic crisis. Many Spanish cities, like Madrid, are in debt and have outsourced services, trying to cut costs. And the companies with the concessions say that, for efficiency's sake, they need to hold workers' costs in line. The unions for Madrid's street cleaners vow to stand firm and said city hall's attempt to use a national workforce for minimum services could lead to ""disagreeable scenes"" confronting workers against workers, said Juan Carlos del Rio, of the General Workers Union. The unions vow to stand firm, but acknowledge that Saturday is also the deadline when negotiations expire on the strike issues. It means, Del Rio said, that the companies could begin to carry out all 1,134 job cuts, even though in negotiations the two sides had discussed formulas to reduce the cuts to around 600 jobs in exchange for other concessions from the remaining workers. There was no agreement on that formula either. And the trash keeps piling up.","Hotel, shop owners calling for intervention in Madrid street cleaners strike .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Al-Shabaab militants killed at least 12 people Tuesday in a car bombing and assault on a police station shared by African Union peacekeepers in a key Somali commercial hub, authorities said. At least four of the Islamist attackers also were killed as Somali police and AU troops responded to the assault on the police station in Beledweyne, about 200 miles north of the Somali capital of Mogadishu, said Abdi Farah Laqanyo, governor of the Hiran region. The attack is the latest on Somali and AU forces by Al-Shabaab, a group that is fighting the government in hopes of turning Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state. A car packed with explosives was driven into the station's gate and burst ""into a huge ball of flames"" about 11 a.m., Laqanyo said. Attackers then entered the police compound and exchanged fire with police and AU forces, authorities said. The station is a base for Djiboutian troops serving as peacekeepers for the African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, which supports Somali forces in cracking down on Al-Shabaab. The attack killed at least 10 defenders -- six Somali policemen and four Djiboutian soldiers with AMISOM -- said Col. Abdilkadir Osman, a police officer in the town. Two civilians also were killed, authorities said. A spokesman for Al-Shabaab's military operations, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, said the group carried out the attack. Abu Musab claimed the attack killed 18 AMISOM troops and 23 Somali forces, though CNN could not independently verify that count. A witness who was 200 meters from the site said the attackers used assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades after the car bombing. The witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a plume of black smoke rose from the police station. Tuesday's fighting comes less than a month after a suicide attack claimed by Al-Shabaab killed 16 people at a cafe in Beledweyne. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said Tuesday he was sending condolences to the victims of what he said was a ""stupid attack."" ""I say this was a stupid attack because our enemies need to understand that these attacks do nothing to advance their cause, however misguided,"" Mohamud said. ""We are making great progress while our enemies are on the back foot and reduced to sporadic and self-defeating attacks with no regard to life."" Beledweyne is the capital of the Hiran region. Situated near the Ethiopian border, it is a commercial hub linking southern and northern Somalia. Though Al-Shabaab is fighting the Somali government, it has launched attacks in other countries as well, and it has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for September's four-day siege at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where at dozens of people were killed. The U.S. government designated Al-Shabaab as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Responding to the latest undercover video by an anti-abortion group, women's reproductive health care provider Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday it will retrain more than 11,000 staff members at more than 800 centers across the United States. Planned Parenthood has ordered ""all health center staff and educators who have contact with patients and teens be retrained in understanding our policies and procedures for responding to situations that indicate that the welfare of a minor is endangered,"" Stuart Schear, vice president for communications at Planned Parenthood, said in a statement issued Tuesday. The retraining will be completed by April 1, Schear said. The announcement came in the wake of the anti-abortion group Live Action's sixth undercover video of a Planned Parenthood clinic that purportedly shows staff ""willing to assist sex trafficking and exploitations of minors and young women,"" group president Lila Rose said in a written statement. Affirming a zero tolerance policy Tuesday, Planned Parenthood said in a statement that employees will be fired in cases of confirmed failure to comply with the group's procedures for situations involving endangered minors and with states' mandatory reporting laws for underage girls. The Live Action videos are reminiscent of those by right-wing videographer James O'Keefe, who targeted ACORN, an organization that advocated for low- and middle-income people and worked to register voters. Those videos purported to show a ""pimp"" and a ""prostitute"" asking for advice on setting up a brothel and evading taxes. O'Keefe's videos were found in at least two investigations to be so heavily edited as to be an unreliable record of what happened, showing no evidence of any wrongdoing by ACORN staff members. But those investigations were completed too late to save the organization. The Live Action videos also appear to be heavily edited. All were apparently taped in January, when Planned Parenthood says it learned of at least 11 undercover visits in six states over one week ""in which persons claiming to be involved in sex trafficking with minors asked for services for young women."" Schear said he expects more Live Action announcements about the other visits. Planned Parenthood reported the visits to the U.S. Justice Department before any of Live Actions videos were released. Like the prior ones, the latest secretly recorded video uses a couple portraying themselves as a pimp and a prostitute who are seeking abortions for underage girls. Last week, Live Action released undercover videos of four Planned Parenthood health centers in Virginia and one in New Jersey. Planned Parenthood officials fired a staff worker in the New Jersey office, but defended the others by saying they behaved professionally and appropriately reported the incidents to the U.S. Justice Department. The latest video claims to show a Planned Parenthood staffer and a supervisor in the Bronx borough of New York City guiding the pimp and prostitute actors on how to get abortions for girls as young as 13. But the Bronx video was ""clearly doctored and cannot be trusted,"" Schear said. ""The truth is that Live Action has a history of doctoring video, making false claims and has no credibility,"" Schear said in a statement. ""This is a tactic similar to that of James O'Keefe, the discredited right-wing activist long associated with Live Action."" The edited Bronx tape contains two or more video sources, as well as an additional audio source, increasing the opportunity for manipulation and selective editing, Schear said. Unlike in the other publicized videos, the hoax visitors in the Bronx weren't able to get past the reception desk for a private consultation, Schear said. The two Planned Parenthood workers in the Bronx told the FBI in an interview that ""they did not hear the words 'sex work' or 'sex worker' uttered by the actors on camera,"" Schear said. FBI spokeswoman Jenny Shearer declined to comment on the ongoing controversy about the undercover videos. ""I can't comment on something I haven't seen. I'm unaware of which field office they are communicating with,"" she said Tuesday. Justice Department spokeswoman Alisa Finelli said Tuesday the U.S. attorney general's office received a letter last month from Planned Parenthood alerting officials to the visits by the purported pimp and prostitute seeking abortions for minors. Finelli declined to comment further. Schear described the undercover videos as ""an effort to undermine the credibility of Planned Parenthood staff in Live Action's coordinated lobbying effort to support legislation that would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funds."" Congress is considering such a proposal, put forward by Republicans. Rose of Live Action said Planned Parenthood's retraining program ""is nothing more than window dress."" ""Live Action's investigation has uncovered a serious, institutional crisis in which Planned Parenthood is willing to aid and abet sex trafficking and exploitation of minors and young women,"" Rose said in a statement. Live Action describes itself on its website as ""a leading new media, investigative, and educational organization committed to the protection and respect of all human life."" Rose has said that her purpose in making the videos -- and making available the edited versions -- is to ""take down"" Planned Parenthood. Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the 95-year-old organization is the nation's leading provider of reproductive health care and serves 3 million patients a year. One in five women has come to its health centers at some point in her lifetime, she said. ""To further our commitment to our patients, we will continue to work to expand access to health care and coverage for women and oppose efforts, such as those currently before Congress, that would eliminate vital health care services that women and families need,"" Richards said. Officials with Planned Parenthood of New York City said that if underage girls came into the center, ""they would have met with a licensed social worker."" ""All teens coming into Planned Parenthood of New York City are screened for child abuse and neglect. All teens who disclose abuse meet with a licensed social worker, who records and reports the abuse,"" the group said in a statement.","The anti-abortion group Live Action releases its sixth undercover video .

"(CNN) -- U.S. military leaders are ""angry"" and ""ashamed"" over sexual assaults plaguing the armed forces, President Barack Obama said Thursday after ordering top Pentagon officials to ""leave no stone unturned"" in the effort to stop the abuse. The president's comments came the same day legislation was introduced in Congress to ease the victims' quest for justice, a move that followed news this month of two high-profile cases involving sexual assault in the military -- allegedly by the very service members tasked with preventing such crimes. Obama summoned Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He told the two that it was imperative they find a solution to the abuse that is undermining trust in the military. ""Not only is it a crime. Not only is it shameful and disgraceful. But it is also going to make our military less effective than it can be,"" Obama told reporters after the meeting. ""As such, it is dangerous to our national security. So this is not a sideshow. ... This goes to the heart and core of who we are and how effective we're going to be."" During the meeting, Obama heard from Hagel, Dempsey and other Pentagon leaders: ""They care about this. They're angry about it. I heard directly from all of them that they're ashamed by some of what's happened."" Survey shows troubling trend in military sexual assault . The military has been hit hard over the issue of sexual assault among its ranks, with the Defense Department this month releasing results of a survey that found there were an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, which ranged from rape to groping, among troops in 2012. The findings were a 35% jump from the estimated 19,300 cases in the 2010 report, the Defense Department said. The alarming figures were released as two cases under investigation brought the problem to front and center in media reports. An Army sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at Fort Hood, Texas, is being investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. The military has not identified the soldier, but said he has been relieved of duty while investigators look in to the allegations. After officer charged, military officials face tough questioning . In early May, an Air Force officer who worked with an assault prevention unit was charged with sexual battery and removed from duty. He is accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in an Arlington County parking lot not far from his Washington office. On Thursday, the head of the sexual harassment prevention unit for the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was relieved of duty after he was arrested in a domestic dispute. ""This is a domestic matter between a man and wife,"" said Army spokesman George Wright. Lt. Col. Darin Haas turned himself in to Clarksville, Tennessee, police on allegations of violating an order of protection and stalking, police spokesman Charles Gill said. Hagel has said he's disgusted over the most recent allegations and has called for a re-evaluation of how service members are chosen to work in sexual assault prevention units. He's ordered that everyone who currently works in those units be retrained and rescreened, and that they have to earn their credentials again. What are the sexual assault prevention units? The president's order came as Democratic Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York introduced legislation Thursday that would remove what is known as chain of command from a process that victims have to go through to get their claims heard. Gillibrand wants to give military prosecutors the power to decide whether cases are investigated. The current system of reporting often works like this: When someone wants to report that they've been violated, that person typically goes to commanders who decide whether the claim is legitimate and can be passed along for further investigation. The system, the senator asserts, opens the victim up to retaliation. Gillibrand and others feel that a commander cannot be an impartial figure and may be inclined to protect not just the victim but the perpetrator who is also his or her subordinate. ""When we just talk (to victims) informally, they tell us they don't report because they are afraid of retaliation, being marginalized, having their careers end or being blamed,"" she said on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper. ""And so what we have to do is create a different dynamic so they feel more comfortable reporting."" The military defines unwanted sexual contact as sexual crimes prohibited by military law, from rape to abusive sexual contact. Of those estimated 26,000 cases in the Pentagon survey, only 3,374 came forward to report an alleged sexual crime in 2012. While that disparity is clear; the lower number still marks a 6% increase in the report of alleged sexual crimes compared with 2011, the report showed. At a Thursday press conference, survivors of sexual assault spoke about the hell they've been through and how difficult it was to have their cases investigated. Retired Air Force Technical Sgt. Jennifer Norris said she thought it was a better option to ""suck it up"" than to report being assaulted. ""I did not want to be stigmatized for reporting my assaults as I tried to move forward in my career,"" she said. ""Instead the best option for me was to try and endure it, to suck it up, and try and make it till I could get transferred somewhere else only to have it happen over and over again like a recurring nightmare."" Norris began to weep. Former Navy Petty Officer Third Class Brian Lewis was stationed in Guam when he was raped, he told reporters. ""After the rape, I was told by my command not to file a formal report with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service,"" he said. ""When I was reassigned to seek medical help, my psychiatrist told me that I was lying about my rape and diagnosed me with a personality disorder."" Lewis was discharged in August 2001. ""I have been fighting to correct my record ever since,"" he said. CNN Radio: Listening to two victims .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's election campaign was heavily infused with the rhetoric of change. Voter turnout was the highest since the 1970s. A large number of new youth voters also entered the fray. Yet the evolution of democratic culture in Pakistan produced a rather conventional outcome -- victory for a two-time former prime minister known for corruption and the military coup that ousted him in 1999. Nawaz Sharif and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League -- Nawaz (PML-N) will still be on the hook to produce change for over 180 million Pakistanis -- and there is a lot to change. The good thing is that there is not a lot of confusion over what Pakistan's problems are. Sharif's wide margin of victory also affords him a broad mandate to make bold policy decisions without the same political instability that plagued the outgoing Pakistan People's Party government. Will he take advantage of this opportunity? Yes and no. Sharif has rightly prioritized the economic situation, but he will still have to pick and choose his battles on reform. The economic challenges demand both short-term fixes and long-term reforms. Most governments in Pakistan have opted for short-term fixes because the path to reform simply takes too long or lacks political support. Sharif might have support in the National Assembly for some of the more difficult reforms, such as taxation and cutting energy subsidies, but the backing of special interest groups, trade unions and provincial governments among others will not always be guaranteed. Real reform will require the buy-in of these stakeholders too. Sharif could be the man to do it. He is a free-market oriented businessman who in his previous tenures as prime minister focused on privatization, infrastructure development and deregulation. But his views alone won't carry the country towards the free market. Sharif will also need to strengthen his party's links to economic and political stakeholders outside of Punjab, where the PML-N has a smaller presence than the other regional parties. A prime example of where Sharif's outreach will be needed is in Karachi. The megacity contributes to over 20% of the country's GDP and is also home to a multi-billion dollar informal economy. These economic gains have been threatened by unprecedented violence between the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), and the Awami National Party (ANP) -- all of whom are looking to benefit from the financial spoils. Karachi's economic environment has no doubt learned to adjust to the fluctuating security situation, but the national government cannot afford to let it get worse. Fixing Karachi will require Sharif to garner the support of MQM, PPP, and ANP -- none of whom at this point look poised to join his government. Security is the other area where Sharif faces high expectations, but will be forced to be flexible and accommodating to competing interests. More than ever before, the Pakistani public, politicians and the military agree on the existential threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban. The military's on again-off again campaign against these militants in the country's Federally Administered Tribal Areas has failed to end violent attacks on ordinary citizens and government targets. The spike in attacks during the election campaign is evidence enough of that. Sharif will have to find his public voice on militancy, an issue he has been resoundingly silent on. This isn't surprising considering his own Punjab province is a hotbed of militant activity in the south. Part of the problem is that the PML-N-led government in Punjab has not taken aggressive legal or police action against militant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Sipah-e-Sahaba, some of whom in recent months have been implicated for their involvement in major attacks outside of Punjab. The lack of action against these groups seems to have protected the PML-N against attacks during the campaign. There have also been fewer attacks within Punjab. Sharif cannot pursue this informal arrangement at a national level. He will also have to get behind the military's campaign against the Pakistani Taliban but has to be cautious in how forward he leans. Sharif could continue to protect Punjab at the expense of the country, or he could be bold and help the military wipe out the Pakistani Taliban -- either way, he still loses a little. Pakistanis deserve enormous credit for showing up in large numbers to vote in the face of such violence. Sharif and the PML-N should be congratulated on winning big, especially with so much hype in Punjab over Imran Khan, the famed politician and cricket star. But the high voter turnout and election victory just put Sharif back on the map. Based on the options he faces, there are plenty of reasons to be less sanguine on the prospects for quick and easy policy-making. It is now up to Sharif to figure out how to navigate the long road ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shamila N. Chaudhary.","Pakistan elects two-time former prime minister known for corruption and military coup .

"(CNN) -- Officials sparred Sunday over a proposed plan to send observers into Syria as the nation's president warned against military intervention. In an interview with the Sunday Times in the United Kingdom, President Bashar al-Assad warned that any potential military intervention against his country would lead to ""very dire"" repercussions, and said that Syria ""will not bow down"" despite international threats of economic sanctions over the government's crackdown on protesters. He accused the Arab League, which recently suspended Syria's membership, of helping pave the way for western intervention. ""If they are logical, rational and realistic, they shouldn't do it because the repercussions are very dire,"" he said. ""Military intervention will destabilize the region as a whole, and all countries will be affected."" Meanwhile, Syria's foreign minister said an Arab League plan to send observers into his country needed clarification before Syria would sign on. ""I would like to make the situation clear between us so that ... a proper decision is taken. The situation does not bear or require hastiness or reaction,"" Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told reporters, urging the Arab League to take more time to develop a plan that the organization's foreign ministers approved last week. ""It requires a study that is rational, because clearly any analysis shows that some Arab parties want to use the Arab League as a tool to get to the (United Nations) Security Council."" Earlier Sunday, the Arab League said it had rejected changes Syria proposed to the plan. The league said in a statement that Syria's request ""impinges on the core of the Arab peace plan"" and would ""radically"" alter the observers' mission. On Wednesday, Arab League foreign ministers gave Damascus three days to implement a protocol to allow observers to enter the nation to verify whether the regime has taken measures to protect civilians. The league's statement Sunday said it had no mandate to further negotiate its with Syrian officials. Arab League representatives will meet again Thursday in Cairo to discuss the situation in Syria, officials from the foreign ministries of Egypt and Jordan said. Egypt: 10 killed in Tahrir Square protests . Syria's foreign minister Sunday criticized the Arab League's stance on Syria and repeated claims that ""armed groups"" -- not government security forces -- were responsible for violence. ""The Arab League, they ignore the presence of armed groups, the terrorist armed groups who kill the people, and if they would recognize the presence of such groups they would not have conducted themselves in the way they are behaving,"" he said. ""I would say, and I am confident of what I am saying, there will not be civil war however much they try to manufacture it, and our people are aware enough in order to get rid of such a division."" The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said ""huge masses"" of Syrians rallied in the capital to reject the Arab League stance on their country. Activists said rocket-propelled grenades had hit the ruling Baath Party's headquarters in Damascus. Moallem told reporters that report was ""completely untrue."" CNN was not able to confirm the reports independently because of the restrictions Damascus places on foreign journalists. The Syrian president faces increasing international pressure to step aside as his government continues an eight-month crackdown on the opposition. The United Nations has said more than 3,500 people have been killed in the violence. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, said 12 people were killed on Sunday. Al-Assad disputed reports that thousands of civilians have been killed. His office placed the actual number at 619. ""We, as a state, do not have a policy to be cruel with citizens,"" he told the Times. ""The important thing is to look for the wrongdoers and hold them responsible for their actions."" Al-Assad told The Sunday Times that recent attacks on the Syrian army showed he was facing armed fighters, not peaceful demonstrators. ""The conflict will continue, and the pressure to subjugate Syria will continue,"" he told the newspaper. ""Syria will not bow down."" Al-Assad vowed he would personally fight and die to resist foreign forces, according to the Times. When asked how he felt seeing images of children shot, al-Assad told the Times, ""Like any other Syrian, when I see my country's sons bleeding, of course I feel pain and sorry. Each spilt drop of blood concerns me personally. But my role as president is in deeds, not words and sorrow. My role is to think about the steps I should take to prevent more bloodshed."" Protesters in Syria are demanding al-Assad's ouster and democratic elections. Al-Assad has been in power since 2000. His father, Hafez, ruled Syria for three decades. In his interview with the Times, al-Assad said he intends to hold elections early next year. ""We're going to have a new parliament. After that, we're going to have a new government. We're going to have a new constitution. That constitution will set the basis of how to elect a president,"" he said, adding he would step aside if he lost a presidential election.

"(CNN) -- Fresh explosions and riveting gunfire punctuated the pre-dawn hours Monday in cities around Syria, opposition activists said, with the ongoing violence coming on the heels of yet another bloody weekend in the embattled nation. Around 3 a.m., the Local Coordination Committees of Syria -- a network of opposition activists -- reported on its Facebook page that at least three major blasts in a few hours had rattled the Damascus neighborhood Mazzeh, where persistent gunfire rang out for at least an hour. The same group also reported other pockets of violence early Monday around the capital, including ""intense shooting"" in Dummar and Keswa ""from the security checkpoints all over the city."" Some of the latest violence appeared to pit Syrian government forces against members of the rebel Free Syrian Army. That included clashes in Douma, where the LCC reported ""shooting from all the checkpoints in the city ... as a result of clashes between the Free Syrian Amry and the regime's army."" In Deir Ezzor, Free Syrian Army members purportedly destroyed ""the Division of the Countryside,"" a government ministry, as the opposition fighters battled government forces who were subjecting them to ""intense shelling."" The activist network also reported Monday morning that regime forces had ""launched a looting campaign"" of homes in the Aleppo suburb of Atareb, even occupying some homes whose residents had fled the city due to perilous shelling. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But more than 8,000 people have died in the conflict, according to the United Nations. Opposition activists say the overall toll is more than 9,000, most of them civilians. That includes dozens reportedly killed around the country Sunday, including three killed in addition to at least 25 others wounded in a car bombing in the northern city of Aleppo. The bomb detonated near the political security branch in Aleppo, which is Syria's largest city, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency described the blast as a ""terrorist bombing"" and said that two people were killed. The explosion ripped the facade off a residential building, the government news agency said. The blast occurred a day after 27 people died after two ""booby-trapped"" cars exploded in crowded areas of Damascus, said SANA. The blasts also injured 140 people and caused serious damage to surrounding buildings, according to the official news agency. A Syrian rebel leader vehemently refuted the government's claim that so-called ""terrorists"" -- not the regime itself -- were behind the Damascus blasts. ""This is the regime's game. This is how they play their dirty tricks. They carry out these types of explosions from time to time to get more international support and compassion,"" Capt. Ammar al-Wawi of the rebel Free Syria Army said Sunday. ""They are desperately trying to prove to the world that they are fighting against armed gangs, but the reality is they are the ones who are doing all the killings."" At least 67 people were killed in clashes throughout Syria on Sunday, including two children and seven soldiers from the Free Syria Army, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Nearly half of the dead were in the northeastern city of Deir Ezzor, where 29 people were reported killed in reported shelling by government troops, according to the LCC. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said heavy gunfire and explosions echoed in the city as government forces and Syrian defector groups clashed, the observatory said. Another 14 were killed in Idlib, eight in Homs and seven in the suburbs of Damascus, the LCC said. Four Syrian soldiers were killed in fighting with defectors near the northern city of Jisr al-Shugur, the Syrian Observatory reported. Pro-Assad forces also assaulted and arrested opposition leader Mohamed Sayed Rasas during an anti-government protest in Damascus, the observatory said. More than a year after the start of the regime's crackdown on dissidents, reports of deaths mount every day. And it's not just deaths. Opposition activists also described what happened to 32 surviving children and two women after an attack last week in the Rifai district of Homs province. ""The children were tortured -- beaten, abused, fingers cut off, and shot by thugs,"" said a man who uses the pseudonym Waleed Faris. Another activist, identified only as Abu Faris, was part of a rescue operation in Rifai. He described seeing abandoned neighborhoods, ""tens of bodies"" and ""horrific corpses, shot, mutilated -- everywhere."" The humanitarian situation across Syria is deteriorating, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement Sunday. ""The ICRC is particularly concerned about vulnerable people, such as those detained in connection with the fighting and those who are sick or injured and need medical care,"" said ICRC president Jakob Kellenberger, who was scheduled to discuss the situation with Russia's foreign minister in Moscow on Monday. Most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. But al-Assad's regime has insisted that ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the violence and says it has popular support for its actions.

"(CNN) -- Want to combine your frequent flier points with friends and family to earn free flights faster? JetBlue Airways will now allow members of its TrueBlue loyalty program to register as a family to share loyalty points within a designated group. ""It's a GREAT way for family and friends to combine points so they can earn a free ticket a lot easier and quicker,"" aviation blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala wrote in an e-mail. ""I wish the other airlines would do the same."" Adult TrueBlue members can sign up for family pooling, including one other grownup and up to five children who are also members. Each family member can decide what percentage of their points to contribute to the family account. From there, the chosen ""head of household"" can monitor the family's account and redeem points at JetBlue. Members can join only one JetBlue ""family."" JetBlue executives may be trying to strengthen a loyalty program that doesn't have as many airline partner options as traditional carriers. JetBlue lists American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Aer Lingus and Emirates among its loyalty partners. In contrast, United Airlines lists 28 worldwide Star Alliance airline partners in its MileagePlus program. Delta Air Lines SkyMiles Award Travel program lists 26 worldwide partner airlines. TrueBlue allows members to use points for any seat on any JetBlue operated flight with no blackout dates, and its points don't expire. And while other airlines allow loyalty program members to transfer miles, they often charge a fee for the service. JetBlue's upgrades haven't stopped there. The airline is also moving to make its cross-country service between New York City and its West Coast cities San Francisco and Los Angeles more attractive for business class travelers. It announced its new premium ""Mint"" seating last month.

"(CNN) -- A federal magistrate has refused a request from lawyers for the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect that would allow them to take ""current and periodic"" photographs of him, which would have been kept from the government. In an order on Friday, Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's request ""fails to establish that future photographs are subject to the attorney client privilege."" Tsarnaev, 19, is hospitalized at a federal prison facility northwest of Boston after being captured and charged in connection with the April 15 bombing attack near the marathon finish line that killed three and injured more than 260 others. Lawyers for Tsarnaev said they wanted to take photographs of their client and his injuries over time to provide evidence of ""his evolving mental and physical state"" while in federal custody. But Bowler rejected the request, citing prison security. But the judge did say Bureau of Prison staff could take any photos in the presence of counsel, but that the government should get copies. ""This reasonable accommodation adequately addresses the defendant's need to document the defendant's condition,"" said Bowler.","Lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wanted to take photos of him while in custody .

"Rome (CNN) -- Lawyers for former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have asked if he can serve his one-year sentence for tax fraud as community service, Milan's chief prosecutor said Friday. A judge will rule on the request, received from Berlusconi's lawyers Friday morning, in the coming days, Chief Prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati said. No details have yet been revealed as to what kind of community service it might be, when it might start or where it would be served, whether in Rome or Milan. Amanpour: Berlusconi turns Italy into a political Circus Maximus . In recent days, Italian media have speculated that Berlusconi might look to carry out a community service order at a church or a refugee center in Rome, both near his residence in the capital. Italy's highest court in August upheld a four-year sentence handed down to Berlusconi by a lower court for tax fraud, of which he will serve only one year because of an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding. He is not expected to serve a prison term because of his age, leaving a choice between house arrest and community service. Berlusconi, 77, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, has for decades been one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. Besides the tax fraud case, he is appealing a prison sentence handed down in June for abuse of power and having sex with an underage prostitute. He has insisted the prosecutions against him are politically motivated. Last week, he was forced into a political climbdown when members of his center-right People of Freedom Party signaled they would defy his orders and back a coalition government in a crucial confidence vote. As it became clear that his bid to topple the government was doomed to fail, Berlusconi announced in the Senate that his party would support the confidence motion after all. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Prosecutor: Silvio Berlusconi has asked to serve his tax fraud sentence as community service .

"(CNN) -- At home and at work, there was no doubting Mary Sherlach's success. Professionally, she'd worked in three Connecticut school systems before settling in as school psychologist at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, writing on her website that ""I truly enjoy working with the SHS staff, parents and children."" Personally, she'd been married to her husband for more than three decades and, together, they were ""proud parents"" of two daughters in their late 20s. It all ended in an instant Friday morning, when, authorities say, 20-year-old Adam Lanza went into Sherlach's school and killed her and 25 others, including 20 young students. Details were still emerging Friday night about exactly what happened. But a parent told CNN that she was in a room with Sherlach, the school's principal, Dawn Hochsprung, and its vice principal when they heard a ""pop, pop, pop"" sound around 9:30 a.m. Slain Connecticut principal remembered as energetic, smiling, passionate . The three school administrators headed into the hall to find out what was happening. Hochsprung and Sherlach didn't come back alive. Sherlach, 56, was an expert in psychology, having earned her undergraduate degree in that subject at SUNY Cortland and a master's degree at Southern Connecticut State University. Before becoming a school psychologist, she worked as a rehabilitation assistant at a psychiatric facility, at a group home for disabled adults and as a community mental health placement specialist. Her experience in education included stints in the Redding, North Haven and New Haven public school systems before landing at Sandy Hook Elementary in 1994. During her time in Newtown, Sherlach kept busy as a member of numerous groups such as the district conflict resolution committee, safe school climate committee, crisis intervention team and student instructional team. ""I ... am always ready to assist in problem-solving, intervention and prevention,"" she wrote. In the ""About Me"" section of her website, Sherlach also spoke extensively about her family. ""My husband Bill and I have been married 31 years and are the proud parents of two beautiful daughters, ages 25 and 28,"" she said. Comforting survivors: 'Hug them' and 'cry with them' Sherlach then went into detail about each of her children, one a high school chorus teacher in southern New Jersey and the other a Ph.D. candidate in chemistry at Georgetown University. Sherlach listed her interests as gardening, reading and going to the theater. She and her husband lived in Trumbull, Connecticut, and ""enjoy traveling and spending time at our lake home"" in upstate New York's Finger Lakes region. Her sudden death prompted Jeanne Stocker to write an emotional tribute on Facebook, saying she was ""beyond numb as I lost a good childhood friend.""

"London (CNN) -- A policeman in London appears to have accidentally revealed an arrest plan for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, in what UK media have branded an embarrassing slip-up by London's Metropolitan Police. The photo, snapped by the Press Association news agency and published in several newspapers, shows a clipboard held by a uniformed officer Friday outside the Ecuadorian embassy where Assange has been holed up since June. Clearly legible in a zoomed-in view of the clipboard, on a sheet of paper headed ""Restricted,"" are the words: ""EQ Embassy brief - Summary of current position re. Assange. Action required - Assange to be arrested under all circumstances."" It goes on to suggest possible ways in which he could exit the building, such as in a diplomatic bag or vehicle. The document also appears to warn of the possibilities of ""distraction,"" perhaps by supporters of Assange who have previously rallied outside the central London embassy building. UK police have previously made clear that they intend to arrest Assange if he leaves the embassy, where he is shielded by its diplomatic protection. Ecuador says UK would be 'suicidal' to try and enter embassy for Assange . But the carelessness of an officer in apparently exposing details of the force's plan will likely cause red faces. Asked about the photograph, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police told CNN ""the document is not related to the Julian Assange case."" The apparent slip-up is the latest twist in the Assange case, which has brought unlikely drama to the posh Knightsbridge neighborhood since he sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex crime allegations. This month, Ecuador officially offered Assange asylum in the South American country, but the British say they will not give him safe passage out of the embassy. The Foreign Office says Britain has a legal obligation to hand him over to Sweden, after Assange's legal efforts to avoid extradition were rejected by British courts up to the Supreme Court. The dispute gathered heat when the British Foreign Office, in a letter to Ecuadorian officials, cited a little known law that could temporarily suspend the embassy's diplomatic protection and allow authorities to enter and arrest Assange. Ecuador's resident has dismissed any steps in that direction as ""suicidal."" Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, said his client was willing to answer Swedish prosecutors' questions, but only if he was given certain guarantees. Assange, an Australian, and his supporters claim a U.S. grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him. He says the allegations against him in Sweden are politically motivated, and claims to fear Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he claims he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks. Sweden angrily rejected that allegation last week. What's next for Assange? CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Policeman is photographed holding what appears to be an Assange arrest plan .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The wave of anti-Japanese protests currently sweeping across China has its roots in history but more recently can be traced back to April, when the firebrand governor of Tokyo announced plans to buy a group of islands claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan. He did so without the apparent knowledge or approval of the Japanese government. Spying an opportunity to assert Japanese control over the Senkaku islands, or Diaoyu as they're known in China, Governor Shintaro Ishihara launched an online appeal fund to buy them from their private owners. Donations poured in, prompting a sharp rebuke from China and forcing the Japanese government to wade into the dispute with its own offer for the contested land. Who is Shintaro Ishihara? Ishihara has a long history of making inflammatory comments about China, so much so that in 1999, when he was appointed Tokyo governor, Japan's then chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, sought to reassure China that relations would remain ""friendly."" Before taking office, Ishihara was a well-known author whose name became famous in his early twenties after writing ""A Season of the Sun,"" which won Japan's most prestigious literary prize. He's an outspoken nationalist who in the past has cast doubt on historians' account of the 1937 Rape of Nanking, in which hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killed by Japanese troops. After launching the fund, Ishihara likened China's claim to the islands as like ""a burglar in Japan's house."" What was China's reaction? Back in June, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin dismissed Ishihara's attempt to buy the islands as ""irresponsible,"" and repeated China's ownership claim. ""The Diaoyu Islands are China's territory since ancient times,"" he said. ""The willful talk and action of some Japanese politicians is irresponsible and tarnish and smears Japan's reputation."" When did the Japanese government step in? Faced with the prospect of the islands falling under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo metropolitan government, the Japanese government stepped in with its own bid for the disputed islands. On September 11, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura confirmed that the government had approved the islands' purchase from private owners for 2.05 billion yen (US$26.2 million). In an interview with CNN, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda claimed there was no territorial dispute within China and the only question of ownership emanated from within Japan. ""The Senkaku Islands are an inherent part of Japanese territory, historically as well as under international law, so there's no territorial claim issue between the two countries,"" he said. ""Right now, it is the ownership issue -- whether the individual owns these islands, or the Tokyo metropolitan government or the state. And I think we have to clearly and solidly explain these stances to the Chinese side."" China responded by dispatching six patrol ships to the surrounding waters, ignoring a warning from the Japanese coastguard not to approach. They entered the disputed waters for a short time before leaving, Japan's coast guard reported. At a press conference, Ishihara said of the Chinese patrols: ""We'd better shoo off those who walked into someone's home in dirty shoes, we should shoo them away."" ""I think China has gone crazy. We can't put up with their attitude like Mine is mine, but yours is mine too,"" he added, in quotes that appeared on the Tokyo Metropolitan government website. Citing a government statement, state-run news agency Xinhua said the patrols were ""aimed to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands,"" while the Japanese prime minister said the government would ""take all possible measures to ensure security"" around the islands. How a war of words turned into protests . While the verbal sparring between the Chinese and Japanese governments has played out in a series of statements, protesters from both sides have been taking direct action to assert their countries' control over the islands. In late August, Japan deported 14 Chinese protesters who were arrested after five swam ashore the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands and waved the flags of China and Taiwan. Nine others aboard the waiting vessel were also detained. Days later after the Chinese landing, Japanese activists also made the journey to the remote islets to raise the Japanese flag, prompting China to lodge ""solemn representations to the Japanese ambassador,"" according to Xinhua. The Japanese landing sparked protests by thousands of people in a number of Chinese cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Harbin and Qingdao, according to Xinhua. That was on August 19, almost one month before violent anti-Japanese protests erupted across dozens of Chinese cities, forcing the temporary closure of operations at three plants belonging to Japanese electronics company Panasonic. Background to the dispute . China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Analysts say China's policy on the islands has been maintaining the status quo. According to Xinhua, ""both sides agreed in 1978 to put the issue aside and solve it in the future, using a guideline described as 'laying aside disputes and engaging in joint exploitation' to solve territorial issues with neighboring countries."" ""China's proposal is that we should maintain status quo, neither side should take action to escalate the differences. Regrettably the Japanese government has disrespected the Chinese proposal,"" said Shen Dingli, the Executive Dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Why are the islands considered valuable? Aside from a strong sense of nationalism, a 1969 United Nations report provided added incentive for countries to claim ownership of the islands. The report, by the U.N. Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE), indicated the possibility of large oil reserves in the vicinity, according to Globalsecurity.org. The islands are close to strategically important shipping lanes and their legal owners would also have the right to fish surrounding waters. What happens now? The Chinese government has been calling for restraint and ""rational patriotism"" when it comes to public protests. The United States has also weighed in on the issue with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta urging ""calm and restraint on all sides."" As Panetta spoke, Noda was telling senior government officials to stay on their guard in dealing with mass anti-Japanese protests, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo. Meanwhile, the prospect of economic sanctions has been raised in a strongly worded opinion piece in the state-controlled China Daily newspaper. Jin Baisong wrote that World Trade Organization rules could be used to limit export of ""important materials"" to Japan. ""The global financial crisis increased Japan's reliance on China for its economic well-being. So it's clear that China can deal a heavy blow to the Japanese economy without hurting itself too much by resorting to sanctions,"" said Jin, deputy director of the department of Chinese trade studies at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, which is affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce.","Latest dispute sparked by Governor of Tokyo's attempts to raise public funds for purchase .

"(CNN) -- As Tropical Storm Isaac swirls in the Caribbean -- becoming more powerful mile by mile -- it threatens to unleash disaster once again on vulnerable and often unaware Haitians by Friday night. The possibility of stinging rain and tree-bending wind descending on the hundreds of thousands of Haitians living in camps has aid groups in the country on high alert. By the time Isaac strikes Haiti, it is forecast to be at hurricane strength, bringing destructive wind and water to an area still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake. As much of 12 inches of rain is forecast for some parts of the country, posing danger to the more than 400,000 Haitians in the camps. Many of those people had no idea that a storm was coming, CNN correspondent Gary Tuchman reported from Port-au-Prince. Not until a translator told them that a potential hurricane was nearing did people in the streets know of Isaac's approach or that the government had opened some shelters. Residents of one tent community said they were staying put with their belongings and would ride out the storm. There were no signs of hurricane preparations in the city, no buildings being boarded up in Port-au-Prince. Isaac threatens to bring more destruction, cholera to Haiti . ""These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,"" the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Isaac also poses a risk to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. The storm could hit anywhere in the state, Gov. Rick Scott said Thursday, and it will be up to convention organizers to decide the fate of the event. But before it nears Florida, Isaac is forecast to run over Hispaniola, the island that's home to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. ""The risks are obvious in terms of flooding of low-lying areas,"" said Jean-Michel Vigreux, director for CARE International in Haiti. Even though two-and-a-half years have passed since the earthquake, its impact on the country cannot be understated, he said. Large amounts of rainfall will cause mudslides and runoff that can block roads, or worse. ""The country is still recovering from the earthquake. It's difficult to imagine that (a storm) will hurt the most vulnerable places again,"" Vigreux said. As of 8 p.m. ET, Isaac was about 210 miles (340 kilometers) southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, the center said. It was moving to the west-northwest near 16 mph with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph. The center of the storm is forecast to approach the Dominican Republic on Thursday night and move over the south coast of Hispaniola on Friday, the center said. While the storm is yet to reach hurricane strength, it has already delivered shock waves to the Caribbean, postponing a hearing for September 11 terrorist attack suspects at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Isaac could still become a hurricane on Friday before it reaches Hispaniola,"" according to forecasters. Aid organizations were keeping an eye on Haiti. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, 421,000 people are in camps in and around Port-au-Prince, the capital. Isaac could be the first significant storm to hit Haiti since the devastating earthquake. Tropical Storm Emily threatened in 2011, but it weakened before hitting western Haiti. The forecast map shows Isaac crossing the nation as a tropical storm with winds under 74 mph. ""We watch those storms every single time they come near because Haiti is so vulnerable,"" said Amy Parodi, a spokeswoman for the Christian humanitarian organization World Vision. The agency has met with the government in previous summers to discuss contingency plans for major storms, and pre-positioned relief items are available, she said. Isaac's path remains uncertain, but some computer models show the storm slicing its way up Florida's peninsula. Others send it farther west, into the Gulf of Mexico. Officials are taking the threat seriously. ""Obviously, we hope Isaac doesn't hit Florida, but we must take every precaution,"" said Scott, the Florida governor. While the convention will have the final say on any changes to the planned event, the organizers are working with state and local officials to ensure everyone has the same information, the governor said. But Tampa is not the only part of Florida that could be hit, and Scott urged Floridians to be prepared. ""What everyone needs to do is to starting tracking it, watch the weather, heed any warnings, get ready, get 72 hours' worth of supplies,"" he said. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said his city is prepared for the 50,000 people headed to there for the Republican National Convention, which starts Monday. ""We have contingency plan after contingency plan,"" Buckhorn said. ""We are ready in the event that it happens. I don't think it's going to be a factor in this particular convention. But we are prepared in the event that it is."" Scott said that any police officers who were going to Tampa will still go, and the Florida National Guard will stand ready to back up authorities around the state. He said he spoke with Republican candidate Mitt Romney and assured him the state would be ready for the convention. ""We're a hospitality state that knows how to deal with hurricanes,"" he said. Possibly complicating matters, the convention site -- The Tampa Bay Times Forum -- is a mandatory evacuation zone once storms reach 96 mph, a Category 2 hurricane, according to the Hillsborough County Hurricane Guide. The current forecast doesn't have Isaac reaching that status. At the Guantanamo Bay base, officials canceled the pretrial arguments scheduled to get under way in the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others. Mohammed, who has been held since 2006, is facing charges related to the 9/11 attacks. Pentagon officials said all court events at Guantanamo were canceled because of the potential hurricane. All detainees have been moved to buildings that can withstand such a storm, and those who flew in for the hearing went back home. Officials in the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning for the nation's southern coast. Isaac's impact will be felt in several areas: . Bahamas . The government has issued a tropical storm warning for the southeastern Bahamas, including Long Cay. Tropical storm conditions are expected by late Friday. Cuba . The storm is projected to near Cuba on Friday night. The Cuban government has issued a tropical storm watch for the provinces of Camaguey, Granma, Guantanamo, Holguin, Las Tunas and Santiago de Cuba. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands . The storm was passing south of the islands Thursday, and there were tropical storm conditions forecast through Thursday evening. The forecast called for 2 to 4 inches of rain and as much as 6 inches at higher elevations. The storm surge was expected to be 1 to 3 feet higher than normal but gradually subside during the night. Dangerous surf and rip currents will affect waters there for the next few days. Turks and Caicos . A tropical storm warning is in effect, and tropical storm conditions are expected by late Friday. United States . Outer bands of the storm could reach Florida by Sunday. But the eye of the storm could make landfall anywhere from Galveston, Texas, to the Carolinas, CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said. The five-day projection from the hurricane center puts the storm approaching U.S. landfall on the Florida peninsula Tuesday. Bracing for Isaac? Share your images with CNN iReport, but stay safe.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll continues to rise from devastating flooding in southeastern Pakistan, with authorities saying Friday that 107 children are among the 434 people killed. Roughly 660,000 people are living in refugee camps in the wake of high waters that have wrought havoc for several weeks, Pakistan's national disaster authority said in a statement. This is fewer than the 700,000 reported by the same agency just over a week ago. About 8.9 million people have been affected by the floods, which have destroyed 1.5 million homes in 37,000 villages in Sindh province alone, according to the statement. This marks the second straight year that Pakistan has seen deadly flooding. In August 2010, more than 20 million people were displaced and 1,700 people killed. The latest disaster has lasted longer than a month and caused an estimated $9.7 billion in damage to homes, roads and farms. The United Nations warned Friday that humanitarian aid is running out in the hard-hit region. This comes two weeks after the international organization and its partners launched an effort to raise $357 million to help those most affected -- of which only $19 million has been received, the U.N. said on its website. Safe drinking water and emergency shelter materials could run out within weeks, while agencies on the ground have enough food for a month for the hundreds of thousands affected. ""It is tragic to see families displaced from the floods with no shelter and barely enough to survive on,"" said Fawad Hussein, a U.N. official focused on flood relief. ""These families worry their children will go hungry, and without access to safe drinking water, they fear they will become sick from drinking contaminated water.""","107 of the 434 killed in the flooding are children, the government says .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Arctic temperatures are not enough to cool pro-Western demonstrators' anger at Ukraine's pro-Russian president. Thousands of them refused to budge from Kiev's snow-covered streets, while the European Union's top diplomat made her way there to try to thaw the tensions. Security forces in riot gear tried to herd demonstrators away from government buildings but avoided a hard-nosed crackdown. That could be the result of pressure the West has put on President Viktor Yanukovych in the past two days. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Yanukovych on Monday to urge him to talk with the opposition and avoid violence. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso phoned on Sunday, as did U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who asked Yanukovych not to use brute force against protesters. A tense standoff appeared in the making early Wednesday as riot police gathered around Independence Square, where orange-hatted protesters have set up camp. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton traveled to Kiev on Tuesday, where she held a ""substantial"" meeting with Yanukovych and discussed ""all relevant issues,"" her press service said on Twitter. She also met with opposition leaders. At a roundtable meeting with three former presidents of Ukraine, broadcast on state TV, Yanukovych said both police and protesters were responsible for violence that flared during a protest 10 days ago. He said he had asked the country's prosecutor general to find a way to free detained protesters who had not committed serious offenses. Civil disobedience . The protests started as a beef between Ukrainians keen to move closer to the West and their Russian-allied president over his refusal to sign an agreement that would strengthen cooperation with the European Union. But then baton-wielding officers triggered sympathy for battered protesters, causing more people to join the demonstrators' ranks in Independence Square and pack inner-city avenues with a show of civil disobedience. It became reminiscent of the uprising that swept Yanukovych out of office nine years ago during the Orange Revolution, when he was prime minister. The tensions between those who yearn to reap the benefits of an alliance with the West and those who want to stick close to Moscow are longstanding and would seem to be almost irreconcilable. They split the nation geographically between its western regions, where resentment of past Russian domination is higher, and its East, which was settled by Russians centuries ago. Russians make up Ukraine's largest ethnic minority group, and Russian is widely spoken across the country. Speaking at the roundtable, Yanukovych said he wants to keep good relations with both Europe and Russia, adding that Ukraine needs to protect its own interests. ""I am strongly against opposing relations with Europe in favor of relations with Russia and vice versa. We need to find a way to reunite,"" he said. Opposition parties said they had not been invited to take part in the roundtable. Masked raid . Monday was tense, as police broke down barricades that protesters had erected after progressing to the presidential administration building. Security forces pushed them back toward Independence Square. Minor scuffles broke out, injuring 10 demonstrators, according to one opposition party. Two police officers were injured, state media reported. Masked men ransacked the opposition party's headquarters in a raid, party leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk said. The men, whom he accused of being special forces officers, destroyed the party's server room, Yatsenyuk said. ""Equipment was destroyed, dragged out, across the entire premise of the Batkivshchnya Political Party headquarters,"" he said. Police denied involvement in the raid. At the same time, Yanukovych appeared to offer an olive branch. An announcement on his website said he would back a call for talks with his opponents to work out a compromise. Celebs, burning tires . Faced with temperatures near zero Fahrenheit, the protesters burned tires and sipped hot soup and tea to stay warm. Some played soccer or strummed guitars as they camped out in tents. The crowds often swell in the evenings as people leave work and join the rallies. Former heavyweight boxing champion Ukrainian Vitali Klitschko, who is famous throughout Europe, is also an opposition leader. He chatted with riot police, urging them to stay calm and ""not break the law"" should they be ordered to remove protesters. ""None of us has either guns nor other objects; this is a peaceful protest,"" he said. East vs. West . Yanukovych's refusal to sign the EU deal represents a U-turn in the country's advance toward closer relations with the West. An EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion, protesters say. They accuse Yanukovych of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union. Moscow has leverage that may have affected Yanukovych's decision to backpedal on the EU talks. Russia supplies Ukraine with natural gas, which is essential to keep people from freezing in the country's brutal winters. Moscow can increase Ukraine's energy bills and impose other trade sanctions. The EU is also pressuring Yanukovych to free his chief political opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko, who has languished in jail for two years after being convicted of abuse of power in 2011. The verdict was decried by the EU and other critics as a sham. The Orange Revolution that swept Yanukovych from office in 2004 also brought the pro-Western Tymoshenko to power. Many of the protesters have carried her picture in Independence Square during the rallies.

"(CNN) -- Hewing to Obama administration desires, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson forcefully repeated Thursday what he had already said in as many words -- his committee won't seek new sanctions on Iran for the time being, and no one else should either. Administration officials have publicly tried to talk lawmakers down from acting on legislation that would impose even delayed sanctions on Iran during the first phase of a November agreement to curb the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program in exchange for relaxed sanctions. Johnson, D-South Dakota, said Thursday he supports strong sanctions against Iran and has legislation adding new sanctions ready to move should Iran fail to meet its obligations under the deal, which is meant to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon. ""In the meantime, we should not do anything counterproductive that might shatter Western unity on this issue -- we should make sure that if the talks fail, it was Iran that caused their failure,"" Johnson said in remarks prepared for a Banking Committee hearing on the issue Thursday. Despite Johnson's insistence, other lawmakers haven't given up on the idea of sanctions. A bipartisan group of senators is close to an agreement on tougher sanctions, CNN reported Tuesday, but it is not clear whether the Democratic majority would bring such a deal up for a vote. That deal, if it comes together, would include a new round of sanctions to begin in six months and would bar the enrichment of uranium. It would permit commercial nuclear power as long as the international community monitored it. The bipartisan group includes Democrats Chuck Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois -- all strong supporters of Israel, whose government has panned the deal as a historic mistake. ""We see today that that the Iranians are launching a rocket next week, and though this was supposedly made as their space program, it's well known that this is just a cover for military ballistic weapons program,"" Menendez said at Thursday's hearing. ""I think that a provocative action in the midst of such negotiations should be interpreted as a sign of bad faith, and only reaffirms in our mind why we need to proceed with some efforts here."" But Wendy Sherman, undersecretary of state for political affairs, testified at Thursday's hearing that while there's good reason to be skeptical of Iran, it's important to hold fast with other nations who helped negotiate the deal. ""Now that we have this first step agreed to, and are about to begin negotiations on the comprehensive agreement that we all want, if we indeed say, 'Well, we didn't really mean it, we're going to now impose additional sanctions that you all will have to live with around the world,' our partners are likely to say, 'Well, wait a minute here, you're changing the rules; we agreed to harm our own economies in service to diplomacy, and you're not giving diplomacy a chance.' "" 'Lack of faith' Sherman's comments echoed those of her boss, Secretary of State John Kerry, who told lawmakers Tuesday that U.S. legislation imposing sanctions could give the administration's international partners in the Iranian nuclear deal -- Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France and Germany -- the wrong idea, even if the bill includes a six-month waiting period to see if the interim agreement succeeds. ""Even if the sanctions are not imposed, it implies a lack of faith in the process and an unwillingness to play by the rules that our partners are playing by,"" Kerry said. ""You can design them, we can sit here and be ready to go. We're just saying to you please give us the opportunity to negotiate along the contours of what we have agreed upon."" In his statement Thursday, Johnson agreed to do just that, and suggested that other lawmakers should follow suit. ""Ultimately, while some of us might differ on tactics, it is clear we all share the same goal: to ensure that Iran does not achieve a nuclear weapon, and to do that diplomatically if possible, while recognizing that other alternatives remain on the table,"" he said. ""Now that Iran has come to the table and entered into this first step agreement, I believe this may well be the last best chance to resolve this crisis by diplomacy, and so the President is absolutely right to fully test Iran's leaders,"" Johnson said. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Monday the deal is off if new sanctions are imposed. About the deal . Among other things, the deal requires Iran to limit how much it enriches uranium, a step that boosts the concentration in raw ore of a specific kind of uranium isotope that is best suited to maintaining nuclear reactions. Fuel for nuclear power requires 5% enrichment, but Iran has stockpiles of uranium enriched to 20%. That's not enough for a nuclear weapon but still worrying to international experts who have cast doubt on Iran's previous assertions that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes. The initial agreement limits enrichment to the 5% level and requires Iran to dilute half of its stockpile of 20% enriched uranium to at least 5% and convert the rest to a form that can't be further enriched by the end of the six-month deal. The country is also forbidden from turning on additional machines used in enrichment, and must submit to what Kerry has described as ""unprecedented international monitoring"" of its nuclear program. New designations issued . On Thursday, amid the debate about imposing new sanctions, the administration listed a dozen companies and individuals for helping Iran evade existing sanctions and for providing support for its nuclear program. They include companies and individuals involved in prohibited Iranian crude oil transactions as well as firms and people who helped Iran acquire parts and technology for its nuclear program. The designations show the administration's resolve to enforce sanctions during the six-month interim agreement with Iran, Undersecretary for Terrorism and FInancial Intelligence David Cohen said in a statement. ""Today's actions should be a stark reminder to businesses, banks and brokers everywhere that we will continue relentlessly to enforce our sanctions, even as we explore the possibility of a long-term, comprehensive resolution of our concerns with Iran's nuclear program,"" he said. In a briefing with reporters, a senior administration official put it more succinctly. ""We haven't let up; we won't let up,"" the official said.

"Kaufman County, Texas (CNN) -- David Crone and his wife were friends with their next-door neighbors, Mike and Cynthia McLelland. They enjoyed life in their quiet, idyllic neighborhood east of Dallas. Tuesday, crime scene tape separating their homes showed that not all was well and peaceful. Deputies and other investigators continued their search for evidence at the home of Mike McLelland, district attorney for Kaufman County. The prosecutor and his wife were were killed there over the weekend. Friends discovered their bodies Saturday, nearly two months to the day after someone killed McLelland's chief felony prosecutor, Mark Hasse, in a daytime shooting outside the county courthouse January 31. The Crones were at home during the time frame in which their neighbors were slain. ""I never heard anything,"" David Crone told CNN on Tuesday. His dogs were outside part of the time and never barked, he said. A storm passed through early Saturday, he said. The resident said a neighbor who lives farther away claimed to have heard gunshots. Crone said he and Mike McLelland were members of a rifle and pistol club. As state and federal investigators flood this north Texas county searching for clues in the killing of two prosecutors in two months, the 100,000 people who live here can do little but nervously watch and hope. ""The residents are, I think, astounded,"" said Delois Stolusky, who has lived in Kaufman, the county seat, for 30 years. ""It's just, one and one make two. You can't keep from connecting these. And it's just scary because we have no clue of who did the first shooting. And no clue, of course, yet, who did this one. And so, of course, our concern is what's going to happen next."" The killings have also rattled law enforcement officials, leading to increased security at the Kaufman County courthouse and around the county's elected leaders. ""I can promise you that all of the people in this courthouse, all of the elected officials, all of the other people who are involved in this investigation, are being very well-protected,"" County Judge Bruce Wood told reporters Tuesday. Texas-sized investigation . Wood said ""literally hundreds"" of investigators are working the case. ""I'm not sure what time frame we're on, but I'm confident that they will find whoever committed this crime,"" he said. The investigation is starting from scratch, with no leads in the McLellands' deaths, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. Nor do officials have any further ideas on who killed Hasse. Who's killing Texas prosecutors? McLelland talked to relatives on Friday night, a search warrant affidavit said. Investigators have asked a judge for records of mobile phone calls that were relayed through at least one nearby tower, the documents show. Law enforcement analysts say they believe those behind the attacks had been monitoring and following the two prosecutors, given the locations of the attacks and the brazenness of killing the men where they were most comfortable. The killings have put justice officials across the state on high alert, unsure if or when another such strike might occur. ""This, I think, is a clear concern to individuals who are in public life, particularly those who deal with some very mean and vicious individuals -- whether they're white supremacy groups or drug cartels that we have,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry said. Some, like Harris County's district attorney in Houston, are now under 24-hour security. McLelland himself had a sheriff's deputy guarding his house after Hasse's death. Exactly why the deputy stopped patrolling the home is unclear. CNN affiliate KTVT said the sheriff's department removed the security detail because McLelland thought it was unnecessary and didn't want to waste taxpayer dollars. But sources told WFAA a deputy was dispatched to McLelland's home only as a temporary assignment. The home was equipped with surveillance cameras, but not the kind that constantly record, the affiliate said. Theories abound . With little solid information, speculation on who is behind the killings has included a white supremacist gang targeted by Texas and federal authorities last year, drug cartels and someone with a personal grudge against the slain prosecutors. The white supremacist angle gained traction in part because McLelland, in an interview with The Associated Press before his death, speculated that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could have been behind Hasse's slaying. ""We put some real dents in the Aryan Brotherhood around here in the past year,"" McLelland told the news agency. Prosecutor gunned down outside Texas courthouse . McLelland's office was one of numerous Texas and federal agencies involved in a multi-year investigation that led to the indictment last year of 34 alleged members of group, including four of its senior leaders, on racketeering charges. At the time, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lanny A. Breuer called the indictment a ""devastating blow"" to the organization, which he said used threats and violence -- including murder -- against those who violate its rules or pose a threat to the enterprise. The FBI describes the group as a ""whites only,"" prison-based gang operating since at least the 1980s. While authorities have not said whether they have linked the deaths of Hasse and McLelland, or the involvement of white supremacists, Texas law enforcement agencies did warn shortly after the November 2012 indictment that there was ""credible information"" the group was planning to retaliate. Frank Meeink, a former white supremacist skinhead, said the group could well be behind the killings. ""The indictment that happened a year ago to this group really hurt the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas,"" he told CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Tuesday. ""This isn't an ideology battle here. This is financial."" On the other hand, in the AP interview, McLelland said Hasse wasn't involved in the Aryan Brotherhood investigation. And a gang expert said killing public officials doesn't fit with the group's profile. ""This would be a giant leap for them to kill public officials,"" said Terry Pelz, a former Texas prison warden and expert on the Aryan Brotherhood. He thinks drug cartels concerned about disruptions in the methamphetamine supply are more likely culprits. Other theories . Speculation has also extended to whether the shootings have any connection to the March 19 death of Colorado prisons chief Tom Clements, who was gunned down after answering the door at his home. While authorities have offered no suggestion the crimes are linked, Evan Ebel -- the man suspected of killing Clements -- was once a member of a white supremacist group and died in a shootout with sheriff's deputies in northern Texas on March 21. Pete Schulte, a friend of the McLellands and a criminal defense attorney who has worked in the county, said other lawyers and public servants are nervous. ""Having that type of environment going on where people who are just doing their jobs (and) getting assassinated -- this is what this is, elected officials getting assassinated -- and that is sending a chill through the (legal) community and the community in general,"" he said. He speculated that the killings were ""personal."" ""If this was a case that somebody was trying to change, they would have been going after witnesses and not the prosecuting attorney,"" Schulte said. Michael Burns, McLelland's former law partner, said prosecutors from several counties have exchanged theories about what happened. ""But frankly, none of us know."" ""We're used to hearing this sort of thing happening in Colombia or even Mexico. We're not used to hearing about judicial officials targeted in the United States. It's hard to say whether this is a local phenomenon that involves only one issue locally there, or whether this is the beginning of a trend. As a prosecutor, I can just tell you, we can't ignore it,"" Burns said. ""We're looking out the peephole when the doorbell rings now, where we maybe we weren't before,"" he said. Filling a void . Kaufman County government offices will close Thursday to allow employees to attend a public memorial service in honor of McLelland and his wife, Wood said. A funeral will follow on Friday. Brandi Fernandez, McLelland's first assistant district attorney, has been named to lead the office on an interim basis. She will fill that role until the governor appoints a successor. But whoever becomes Kaufman County's next top prosecutor will have to grapple with the haunting past. ""I wonder if the governor is going to find anyone brave enough to take the job of district attorney,"" Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner told CNN. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Gary Tuchman reported from Kaufman County; Phil Gast reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Holly Yan, Carol Cratty and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Neighbors says he did not hear gunshots .

"(CNN) -- For many, typing has long overtaken handwriting as their primary word and sentence creation method. So much so that some schools no longer teach cursive. But now, Google is bringing some good old fashioned handwriting back to modern communication, adding new handwriting input tools to Gmail and Google Docs. Those tools now allow you to write out what you want to say with a mousepad or cursor and Google will do its best to create a typed version of your words. The input box will show the most likely matches for your word, so below your handwritten ""cats"" it might display this list of possible words: cats, rats, Cats, oats, and carts. Click on the right one and keep on writing. The tool might have a harder time deciphering your fancy calligraphy or messy chicken scratches, but it seems to do a decent job with my sloppy cursive-ish writing. While English is an option, it's more for complicated alphabets where drawing out a character is sometimes easier than typing it, like Japanese or Hindi. ""Handwriting input makes the internet easier to use by people worldwide and is also part of a larger effort to break the barrier between languages,"" said Google's Xiangye Xia in a blog post announcing the feature. Gmail users can get the new tool in more than 50 languages, Google Docs users in more than 20. To test it out, go to your Gmail or Docs settings and, under the Languages setting in the General tab, click ""Show all language options."" Select the box that says ""Enable input tools"" and you'll get a list of every type of keyboard Google has to offer. The languages with a pencil icon beside them are the ones that support written words. Once you've added an input option, you can select it anytime from a drop down on top of the menu bar above the document or email you're writing. Google already has handwriting support for its mobile translation apps so you can scrawl a word on the screen and see it instantly in another language. This is particularly helpful if you're not familiar with a local alphabet and want to know what something says.","Google has added a tool that reads your handwriting and turns it into text .

"(CNN) -- From dusk until dawn, 12-year-old Fayaz toils at his uncle's blacksmith shop in Kabul. While other kids his age are in school, he's swinging a heavy sledgehammer and doing physically exhausting work that he knows is not meant for a boy. But he doesn't have much choice. It has been that way since he was 7, when his father got sick. ""Fayaz went to get the doctor, but the doctor didn't come because they couldn't afford the doctor's services. Later that night, his father died,"" filmmaker Jawad Wahabzada explained recently on CNN's ""BackStory."" ""After that, Fayaz and his two brothers were forced by economic difficulties to work."" Fayaz is one of four young Afghans featured in the half-hour documentary ""Unnoticed: Children of Kabul,"" which Wahabzada co-directed and produced along with iReporter Jon Bougher. Wahabzada said there are 50,000 to 60,000 kids working in Kabul. ""They all share a very similar story,"" he told CNN's Guillermo Arduino. ""Usually either their father died or the father is disabled, mom can't work, so these kids are forced into child labor."" UNICEF has estimated that at least 30% of Afghan children age 5-14 are working in some form. But the issue goes far beyond Afghanistan's borders: UNICEF says that worldwide, approximately 158 million children between 5 and 14, one of every six children in that age group, are engaged in child labor. ""Most of these children are working to help their families meet their basic needs; not all of them,"" said Eric Edmonds, an associate professor of economics at Dartmouth College who advises many U.S. and international organizations on child labor issues. ""I think it's easy to see instances of child abuse and child neglect and assume they're pervasive and they characterize all of those working children. But I think the reality of the situation is that ... most of those working children are doing so to help meet family needs."" While it varies by country, Edmonds said the world's most common child labor -- by far -- is agricultural. Forget about the manufacturing ""sweatshops"" that tend to dominate the headlines. Often, child labor is simply a kid working on the family farm. ""A lot of people say that's character-building, that's good stuff for them to be doing,"" Edmonds said. ""But the risks associated with agriculture are actually a lot more extreme than a lot of shopkeeping-type tasks that you can imagine: children involved in toxic chemicals, children exposed to pests, children operating machinery that's too large for them, isn't designed to be done by them. All are serious risks that unfortunately a lot of children face."" Of course, the risk of physical harm is just one of many consequences that come with child labor, whether it's on a farm, in a factory or on a street. The most serious might be the effect it has on society as a whole. If children are spending most of their time working, they'll never be able to attend school and get the education they need to find a better-paying job one day. Often, they will grow up illiterate and poor and pass on the same problems to their own children. ""Child labor perpetuates poverty,"" said Elena Durón Miranda, a 2011 CNN Hero. ""It compromises the future of any country because it condemns its most vulnerable citizens."" 'A better future' In some countries, children are so desperately poor that they spend their days at trash dumps, scavenging for things to sell and sometimes eat. Eleven years ago, Durón Miranda was shocked to see about 200 children, some as young as 3, working at a trash dump in Bariloche, Argentina. ""I saw children collect green sausages, a bag of potato chip crumbs, a bag of noodles with cream, and recovered leftover yogurt next to a diaper,"" said Durón Miranda, a Mexican who, at the time, was visiting the country for work. ""The children began to gently clean the food -- wiping each little noodle, each potato and peeling the sausage skin so methodically and accurately. It was as if they had done this same activity many times."" Durón Miranda soon learned that many children in Bariloche dropped out of school to spend their lives as ""ragpickers."" ""At that moment in time, my son was the same age as many of them,"" she said. ""So that struck me as horrific."" The scene inspired her to start a nonprofit called PETISOS, which stands for Prevención y Erradicación del Trabajo Infantil SOS (Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor SOS). The organization provides children with free education and extracurricular programs so they don't have to work. Today, more than 200 boys and girls in Bariloche benefit from PETISOS. ""We give them an incentive to have a better future, a different future,"" she said. One of the children featured in Wahabzada's documentary is a ragpicker. Yasamin, a 13-year-old Afghan girl, scavenges the trash dumps of Kabul's richest neighborhoods. ""She usually picks (up) paper and plastic, but if she finds metal, she picks it up, too, and sells it,"" Wahabzada told CNN's Michael Holmes. ""They use the paper and plastic for firewood."" Yasamin's father was killed in a bomb explosion four years ago, and her mother is mentally ill, according to the documentary. So she and her 8-year-old brother have had to help support themselves. ""If you're there in Afghanistan just walking around, you see thousands and thousands of kids working in the street,"" Wahabzada said. ""You see people passing by, and no one pays attention."" The issue has special significance to the young Afghan filmmaker, now a student at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Born in 1991 during the early stages of the Afghan civil war, he was once a child laborer. ""We weaved rugs eight hours a day. ... My friends and classmates every day played soccer (outside the factory),"" he said. ""I could hear them every day shouting, and so the whole time I was making rugs, my mind was outside with them. ""I was fortunate to move to the United States where I received an education. Now I came back to Afghanistan to tell the stories of kids who share a very similar story with me."" His co-director hopes the film will have a positive impact on Afghanistan's future. ""Sixty-eight percent of the Afghan population right now is under the age of 25,"" Bougher said. ""So this is a golden opportunity to really have advancement in this country, to have Afghanistan move forward. ""By really investing in this population, by showing people what's going on ... I think we can really make a difference."" For more information about ""Unnoticed: Children of Kabul,"" e-mail the filmmakers at unnoticedkabul@gmail.com.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Script didn't follow the script. The Script includes, from left to right, Glen Power, Danny O'Donoghue and Mark Sheehan. In the standard showbiz treatment, a group -- say, three plucky, working-class music-mad young men from Dublin, Ireland -- travel to the grand shores of the U.S. of A. They form a band, grab the ear of a noted producer and, with a lucky break or two, are soon opening for the stars who inspired them so many years before. If the story needs a rousing climax, they return as conquering heroes to their homeland, pick up the local paper and find that their new single has gone straight to No. 1. Applause, joyful tears, roll credits. Well, it wasn't quite like that. In the case of The Script -- vocalist/keyboardist Danny O'Donoghue, multi-instrumentalist Mark Sheehan and drummer Glen Power -- O'Donoghue and Sheehan traveled to the States and spent several years as struggling writers and producers. Drummer Power, another Dubliner, had bummed around music scenes for years; he'd met O'Donoghue and Sheehan not long before the pair packed it in and returned to Dublin, plying their trade and looking for breaks. Descriptions of the trio as ""an overnight success"" thus leave them skeptical. If that's the case, said Sheehan before a concert at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia, ""It was the longest night of our lives.""  Watch an interview with The Script » . On the other hand, when success did strike, it struck hard and relatively quickly. When O'Donoghue and Sheehan returned to Dublin, they decided to form a band. They recruited Power, noting their ""great strength together"" -- in Power's words -- after jamming together. The Script's first single, ""We Cry,"" hit the UK Top 20 in the spring of 2008, and the second, ""The Man Who Can't Be Moved,"" hit No. 1. The group's self-titled debut came out in August 2008 in Britain. In December 2008, they played the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, and, in March of this year, opened for U2. (Their album was finally released in the U.S. that same month.) They've spent this summer as Paul McCartney's opening act, which was what brought them to Piedmont Park. Touring with the former Beatle ""feels like a master class for us,"" said Sheehan. The three, all around 30, finish each other's sentences like the old friends they are and display a savvy about the music business. That's only fitting, as O'Donoghue and Sheehan spent their years in America learning the trade alongside producers such as Teddy Riley and the Neptunes. Sheehan says the group is looking for the sweet spot between the ""rock climate"" they grew up in and the hip-hop and R&B sounds that dominate American popular music. ""[With our experience,] we're hashing it out, and I think we've found it,"" he said. (Asked about their own influences, they rattle off hip-hop artists such as Missy Elliott, Jay-Z and Kanye West.) The Script appears to have a happy ending, just as an old tale of rising stars would have it. But the three are quick to point out that aspiring musicians should, well, write their own story. ""If there's a message to younger musicians, to me, it's 'don't give up,' "" says O'Donoghue. ""Magic can happen.""","Musicians spent several years as struggling writers and producers in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- When I was 48, I was working at Boston College, at the pinnacle of my career and raising the family we had waited for so long to start. The last thing I was ready for was being told I had Parkinson's. There we were, being warned that our lives were changing forever. Maura, my wife, didn't blink an eye. When we spoke of the disease, we were always positive and stayed strong. In hindsight, I realize how scared both of us silently were. My daily activities didn't change. I worked, as all coaches do, extremely long days, but looming in the back of my mind was the disease and its progression. To thwart the development I was able to stay active, something I had always been; however, I started to notice small changes, and the inability on some days to complete the simple tasks I had always done. That would come and go; it wasn't consistent. One day I was able to change a light bulb and the next time I would try, my hands would fail me. Afraid to admit the decline was beginning, I never mentioned it to Maura, but I know she was watching, waiting to step in. Parkinson's didn't stop his space walk . Maura started to notice my good days and bad days, and I would see her instinctively change our plans and schedule. She and the kids would jump in and help me the same way that my players had each others' backs on the field. I fondly remember the loving moments of my two girls helping me button my shirt in the morning, though those moments were bittersweet. Shouldn't I be helping them? My newfound clumsiness was beginning to be the elephant in the room, and the locker room was where it decided to expose itself. We had just lost a well-fought game and had to catch the team plane. I had spent all of my energy on the field, and there was nothing left my body would give me. With my hands unable to steady themselves, I couldn't button my shirt. A task so simple, mastered at age 5, was now gone. My weaknesses were completely exposed, and there I was, unable to get dressed on my own. One of my college players, Russell Wilson (now the Seattle Seahawks' starting quarterback), noticed. He came over and helped me in silence, the way Maura or the girls would. I didn't really realize that my players had watched this painful process I was going through. Players were always a part of our family, but here I realized that now I was a part of theirs. This moment was the turning point in my life and changed how I was going to address my condition. NASCAR driver races to stop diabetes . My pride was out the window. I was hoping to make a difference in my players' lives, and now they were watching this unfold. Would they still respect me? Would I still have a job? All those fears that I had pushed to the back came flooding to the surface. I was afraid to tell Maura, afraid that she would think less of me as her husband, less of me as a parent. Instead, everyone dug in and helped secure my dignity in their own ways. All the years of preaching perseverance was paying off. My disease continues to progress despite the fight we rally. I cannot count the things I've lost. That list is extensive, but I prefer to take the lead from another coach, the legendary Tom Landry -- ""I've learned that something constructive comes from every defeat"" -- and now, I am blessed with the things that I have gained. My path may have changed course from where I started, but I am grateful that it has not hit a dead end.","Coach Don Horton was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at 48 .

"New York (CNN) -- One of the motorcyclists believed to have played a direct role in the beating of SUV driver Alexian Lien in New York has been identified, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN late Thursday. He's not yet in custody; however he's expected to be soon. The biker is suspected of being the man seen on video using a helmet to pound on the side of the black Range Rover before Lien was dragged from the vehicle, beaten and slashed, the official said. The video seems clear: An SUV driver hits a biker on Manhattan's West Side and sets off a violent chain of events. But now, a debate is raging over who should shoulder the blame for this disturbing attack. Soon after the helmet cam video of the confrontation spread online, most people's sympathies lay with the driver of the Range Rover, Lien. Online commenters seemed to side with him. He was swarmed by a motorbike gang. He had his wife and 2-year-old daughter in the car. He did what he had to do to protect them, they said. But now, supporters of the bikers being vilified for the weekend attack are pleading their case. They gathered Wednesday night outside the Manhattan hospital where one of the bikers, Edwin Mieses, lies comatose. He was run over by the SUV as the driver tried to escape. ""It is an unfortunate situation on both sides,"" said Lexie Filpo, who said she was one of the bikers. ""I knew that car seemed reckless from the beginning. From when he first jumped on the highway. When things happened, people were telling him to stop, to slow down, and he never did. ""The officers, they want to arrest the bikers; they should arrest the driver as well,"" Filpo said. A group of bikers gathered again Thursday and appealed for calm. ""We, as bikers, have the burden of showing the world that we are not animals and so that's what we intend to do,"" Albert Alkerson told reporters. ""These are not animals. These are people who enjoy riding bikes. What we need to do is figure out how to make sure that this doesn't happen again,"" he said. Official: Biker may have been trying to help SUV driver . Swarmed by bikers . The incident took place on Manhattan's West Side Highway on Sunday. Police said a man driving a Range Rover struck a motorcyclist who had slowed. Previous reporting indicated that the impact broke the motorcyclist's leg, but New York police Sgt. Lee Jones said Wednesday that the biker sustained only minor injuries. Lien, the driver, pulled over and was surrounded by other bikers, part of a group called Hollywood Stuntz. They hit the vehicle and spiked its tires, police said. The driver pulled away, plowing into three more bikers, including Mieses. The bikers chased him. Once he was stuck in traffic, they cornered the SUV. The video shows one biker using his helmet to smash the driver's-side window. Police said the bikers dragged Lien out of the SUV and beat him. His wife and daughter were unharmed. Lien was treated at a local hospital for slashes to his face. Lien's family released a statement Thursday through its attorneys, saying he was ""forced under the circumstances to take the actions that he did in order to protect the lives of our entire family."" He and his wife were out to celebrate their wedding anniversary with their daughter when the incident happened, according to the statement. ""We know in our hearts that we could not have done anything differently, and we believe that anyone faced with this sort of grave danger would have taken the same course of action in order to protect their family,"" the statement said. Lien initially called 911 on Sunday afternoon to report that bikers were driving erratically on the West Side Highway. As the confrontation unfolded, additional calls were logged by 911 operators, including one from Lien's wife that was placed during the attack, police said. Jerome Davis said he witnessed a part of the confrontation and described the SUV driver as a ""maniac."" ""If something happens, you stop right there. It's an accident. You think and stop. You don't keep reacting on,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday. But on CNN's ""New Day"" Thursday, Davis said, ""Two wrongs don't make a right"" and said it was clear the SUV driver was afraid. ""If I was in his shoes, I'd be scared,"" he said. Opinion: In attack, can bikers get a fair shake? No charges against driver . Police have not said that they are seeking any charges against Lien. But they arrested Christopher Cruz, who is seen slowing in front of the Range Rover before he was bumped. Cruz, 28, was in court Wednesday on misdemeanor charges including reckless driving. Cruz's attorney told reporters that his client is not guilty. Cruz was to be released after posting $1,500 cash bail and a $15,000 insurance bond. In addition, his license was suspended, and he was ordered to surrender his passport. ""His motorcycle was struck, and he stood right there,"" Cruz's attorney H. Benjamin Perez said. ""He never assaulted this man. He never tried to assault him in any way. And he does not know any of the other motorcyclists who were involved in this beating."" A second arrested biker was released Wednesday when authorities determined that he may have been trying to help. Allen Edwards, 42, originally faced charges of reckless endangerment, criminal mischief and menacing, police said. But that didn't mean prosecutors were done. ""Prematurely charging individuals with low-level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation and could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of serious crimes,"" said Karen Friedman-Agnifilo, the prosecutor who is overseeing the case. ""After we investigate the facts and each person's individual actions, we will know what charges can be supported by the evidence. There is still a tremendous amount of investigation to be done."" The New York Police Department released images and asked for the public's help in identifying and locating suspects. NYPD detectives have interviewed the motorcyclist whose helmet cam captured the confrontation, according to Deputy Commissioner John McCarthy. They tracked the unidentified biker to his home in Bellport, Long Island, and have the video. Police are also looking at a 2011 video that shows a separate case of biker violence. In it, riders appear to surround and antagonize a motorist. Law enforcement officials said they are examining the footage frame by frame, looking for possible patterns. Standing vigil . Mieses' family says the real victim of the confrontation is the hospitalized biker. ""All of his ribs are fractured. His lungs are so badly bruised that he's still on a ventilator,"" Yolanda Santiago, his mother, told CNN affiliate WCBS. His wife, Dayana, told CNN affiliate WBZ that Mieses got off his bike to help the SUV driver. ""And whatever he did, he got scared, he peeled off, and he paralyzed my husband on the way,"" she said. At the vigil Wednesday night, the attendees raised almost $400. CNN's Lateef Mungin, Pamela Brown,Susan Candiotti, Kevin Conlon and Marina Carver contributed to this report.","NEW: The motorcyclist is not in custody; he's expected to be soon, source says .

"London (CNN) -- For table tennis players Pam Fontaine and Tara Profitt, competing at the London 2012 Paralympics marks the climax of a remarkable journey. ""It's really kind of awesome,"" Fontaine told CNN. ""It's kind of surreal, the chances of it happening -- I thought we probably would've done a better job with winning the lottery than for us both to be able to do it again, 20-something years later."" The U.S. pair first took part in 1984 at Stoke Mandeville, outside London, but then lost touch with each other. They retired from the game to concentrate on other aspects of life -- in Fontaine's case, on her first love, wheelchair basketball. But after each separately decided to take up table tennis again just a few years ago, they were reunited by chance in 2008. Paralympics history comes full circle at London 2012 . In the course of catching up they conjured up a dream: to play together at the London Paralympics, 28 years after they first traveled to the United Kingdom as naive 19-year-olds to represent their country. The idea had an added piquancy because it was Fontaine who had first introduced Profitt to table tennis -- also known as ping pong -- at the Ohio college where they met in 1983. But could they pull it off? It wasn't going to be easy to make the grade for selection nearly three decades later. Aspects of the game had changed, rules had evolved -- and their rivals for coveted spots on the Team USA Paralympic squad could be of any age. What do the Paralympics mean to you? Undaunted, they set about getting themselves back up to speed through dedicated training; Fontaine in the Dallas area and Profitt in her home state of Connecticut, aided by coach Roman Tinyszin. They traveled the globe last year to gain world ranking points in International Table Tennis Federation tournaments, taking in everywhere from Venezuela to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Slovenia and the Netherlands. Fontaine's place in the Team USA squad was confirmed in January this year. Then came an anxious wait to see if Profitt had made it into the last spot in her disability class. Finally the news they had both been praying for came through in March -- she was in. Profitt, 47, was overjoyed by the news. ""It means a lot to me,"" she said. ""The older you get, the more you appreciate the things in life. "" As 19-year-olds, Profitt and Fontaine played singles at the 1984 Games rather than doubles, partly because they fall into different classification bands. The complex Paralympic system is intended to make sure athletes compete against others with the same level of impairment. But this time around they will be competing both individually and in the team event. Fontaine is aware of how much things have changed for Paralympic athletes over the years. ""Back in those days, you had to pay your own way. If you couldn't afford it, you couldn't go, so you had to fundraise,"" she recalled. ""The uniforms were so ugly nobody wanted them."" Despite more than two decades out of touch, the friends still have many things in common. Fontaine has two sons, one in the military and the other starting college, while Profitt has one; all three boys are very close in age. Profitt is accompanied on the trip to London by her husband, Matt -- who was introduced to her by Fontaine when they were all students at Wright State University, in Dayton. They will celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Both women were also successful able-bodied athletes before each suffered a devastating accident while a teenager. Before meeting Fontaine in college, Profitt thought she would never practice sport again after a diving accident left her paralyzed from the chest down in 1979. She still appreciates what Fontaine did in introducing her to life as a disabled athlete. Fontaine had played high school basketball before she was paralyzed in an automobile accident at age 16. The impact, in the days before seat belt laws came into force, sent her flying from the passenger seat through the windscreen. She broke her back, among other injuries, but a month after leaving the hospital she was at her first wheelchair basketball practice. ""I didn't have that period of 'Woe is me,'"" Fontaine said. ""I was right back in it."" Just over a year later, in 1982, she made her first trip overseas to play table tennis. But after competing at the 1984 Paralympics, Fontaine retired from the sport to focus on her beloved hoops instead, eventually retiring as an international basketball player in 2002. Five years later, Fontaine took up table tennis again. She tried for the Beijing squad in 2008 but just missed out on a place. ""I knew I was close to the level, so I said, 'OK -- there's another four years. If I work really hard, try hard, stay on track, maybe I can make the next one.'"" When a fellow table tennis player then put her in touch with Profitt, who had picked up the game again in 2008, their shared dream was born. Since then, they have spoken almost every day, said Fontaine. The fact they are returning to the United Kingdom, where they played in their first Paralympics, makes its realization all the more special. ""It's back where we started -- it's kind of like I went through a full circle,"" said Fontaine. ""We worked really, really had to get where we are and it's been a fun journey for the most part."" Both are down-to-earth about their achievements, despite their inspirational history. Profitt runs two senior table tennis programs, while Fontaine's work as an adjunct professor teaching kinesiology, the study of body movement, at Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth, means she can also share her love of sport. ""I've never really thought of myself as an inspiration -- I just feel that I am blessed to be an athlete. I've been an athlete my entire life,"" Fontaine said. ""If I can help someone along the way, change someone's attitude about people with disabilities, help people to learn something, then that's a good day."" The chance to represent the United States once again at the Paralympics is a ""true honor,"" she said. ""That is one of the greatest honors you can have as an athlete, to represent your country, and your community, and yourself and your family.""","Pam Fontaine and Tara Profitt are playing table tennis at the London Paralympics .

"(CNN) -- The accelerating pace of the slaughter of elephants for their tusks has put African elephants at catastrophic risk in the coming decades. To make matters worse, some of the region's most notorious armed groups are taking tusks to finance their atrocities. The Somali terrorists of al-Shabaab, the Sudanese government-supported janjaweed militia that has been responsible for much of the violence during the Darfur genocide, and the Lord's Resistance Army, which has kidnapped hundreds of boys and girls across central Africa to be fighters and sex slaves, are participating in this illegal trade. These groups typically kill elephants using the automatic weapons that they also use to kill people. And as the militants become more involved in the poaching business, they apply the same lack of discrimination in killing elephants that they have demonstrated with their human victims. For example, poachers thought to be janjaweed from Sudan, working with Chadians, allegedly killed at least 86 elephants, including calves and 33 pregnant females, over the course of a week. The International Fund for Animal Welfare found that at least 400 elephants were slaughtered between January and March 2012 at the Bouba Ndjida National Park in Cameroon. Animal rights groups say poaching is worse than it's been in decades. They say it may be even worse than it was in the 1980s, before the international ban on ivory was put in place. Watch: Fighting the Lord's Resistance Army slaughter of elephants . Typically, the elephants are killed only for their tusks. Poachers often hack off their trunks first and then their tusks with hacksaws and machetes, and leave the bodies to rot. Some Lord's Resistance Army groups have reportedly eaten the meat of some of the elephants they have killed, which is not surprising given their frequent hand-to-mouth existence in the bush. This appalling reality presents an opportunity for conservation groups and anti-atrocity and human rights groups to join forces to combat the threat posed to people and elephants by these armed groups. Achim Steiner, U.N. undersecretary general and the U.N. Environment Program's executive director, said, ""The surge in the killing of elephants in Africa and the illegal taking of other listed species globally threatens not only wildlife populations but the livelihoods of millions who depend on tourism for a living and the lives of those wardens and wildlife staff who are attempting to stem the illegal tide."" According to a report released in March 2013 by UNEP, 17,000 elephants in monitored reserves were killed in 2011. The toll climbed in 2012. The number of elephants killed for their tusks has exploded in recent years because of high prices from rising global demand for ivory, particularly in China and Thailand. The pace of killing outstrips wild elephants' natural reproductive replacement rate. Armed groups take advantage of the increasing value of ivory to fund their atrocities. Their fighters have the training and weapons to kill large numbers of elephants and trade their tusks for arms, ammunition and food. The Enough Project and the Satellite Sentinel Project recently released a report focused on the LRA's poaching of elephant tusks in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Garamba National Park. The LRA, whose leader Joseph Kony is the subject of an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, has for decades terrorized the people of central Africa. Other groups, such as al-Shabaab and the janjaweed, seem to have made similar calculations. Ivory poaching for profit by armed groups is not new. In the 1970s, according to University of London researcher Keith Sommerville, the South African military partly funded its support of white Rhodesian forces fighting African rebel groups through revenue from the killing of elephants in Rhodesia, which was then legal. Rebels in Angola and Mozambique, also supported by South Africa, took tusks and sold them through South Africa. Both poaching and armed groups such as the LRA arise from a vacuum of governance. Indeed, The New York Times correspondent Jeffrey Gettleman and others say that members of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda have participated in the illegal ivory trade as well. Only effective local, national, and transnational action can stop this horror. Anti-atrocity groups such as the Enough Project can advocate for actions to shut off the demand for ivory in Asia. Conservation groups could broaden their focus to include efforts to end wars that have created a symbiotic relationship between ivory poaching and civilian suffering. Both types of organizations should emphasize the longer-term requirement for effective governance to lessen the likelihood of war and ivory poaching. Joint and parallel action could tap activist organizations, increase the pressure on policymakers for action and broaden the knowledge about both of these problems among those who previously had focused on only one. The combined efforts of conservation and human rights groups could spur the efforts of governments and international organizations to slow the destruction of the African elephant and free the people of east and central Africa from the threat of Joseph Kony and his ilk. This could be the start of a beautiful friendship, one that could help stop the massacre of both humans and animals in Africa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Quarterman.","Number of elephants killed for tusks is rising as demand for ivory soars, especially in Asia .

Quarterman: Future grim as the pace of killing outstrips ability to replace deaths with births .
Human rights and conservation groups, he says, should combine efforts to stop suffering ."
"(CNN) -- With the season only a third completed, Martin Jol became the third managerial casualty in the English Premier League as Fulham announced Sunday that the Dutchman had been sacked. Saturday's 3-0 defeat to fellow strugglers West Ham was the west London side's fifth straight EPL defeat and left them third from bottom. The two teams below them, Sunderland and Crystal Palace, have already parted company with their managers after sorry starts to the 2013-14 campaign. Paulo Di Canio was the first to go at Sunderland, with Gus Poyet taking charge, while Ian Holloway left Palace to be replaced last week by Tony Pulis. A statement on Fulham's official website confirmed the 57-year-old Jol's fate, ending his two and a half year association with the club. ""Our poor form and results this season are undeniable and Fulham supporters deserve better,"" said Fulham chairman Shahid Khan. ""With more than half the season still ahead, an immediate change was necessary,"" he added. American Khan hired former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen to work alongside Jol last month and he will now take over with ""immediate effect,"" he said. Jol was sacked by Tottenham Hotspur in 2007 before going on to successful spells at Hamburg and Ajax, returning to the EPL with Fulham in 2011. Current Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas is reportedly under pressure for his job after disappointing recent results, but he may be breathing a little easier after his side fought to a 2-2 draw against reigning champions Manchester United in the early kickoff Sunday. Tottenham, thrashed 6-0 at Manchester City last weekend, twice led through Kyle Walker and Sandro only for Wayne Rooney to twice equalize for the visitors. Walker put Tottenham ahead from an early free kick, but it was then his blunder which allowed Rooney to level after the home side had wasted a series of chances to go further ahead. Brazil international Sandro's blistering strike put Tottenham ahead again but the lead lasted only moments as Rooney scored his 10th of the season from the penalty spot after Hugo Lloris had pulled down Danny Welbeck. The draw left United in eighth place in the standings, nine points behind leaders Arsenal, with Tottenham a point further back in ninth. Tottenham's next match will be at Fulham Wednesday night, an early test for Meulensteen, as part of a full EPL midweek program. Liverpool's title challenge suffered a setback Sunday with a 3-1 defeat at promoted Hull City. They were looking to cut the gap on Arsenal to just four points with a win, but fell behind to an early goal from Jake Livermore, who is on loan from Tottenham. Steven Gerrard equalized with a trademark free kick seven minutes later, but in the second half Hull stunned the visitors with two further goals. First David Meyler scored with a low shot after Liverpool's defense failed to clear and with three minutes left Tom Huddlestone's shot was deflected into his own goal by Martin Skrtel. Liverpool have also lost England striker Daniel Sturridge for up to eight weeks with ankle ligament damage, they revealed. In the late kickoffs, Chelsea and Manchester City scored important victories to keep pace with Arsenal. Chelsea beat Southampton 3-1 at Stamford Bridge to move back into second spot, four points adrift of the leaders. They were behind after just 15 seconds as Jay Rodriguez took advantage of a mistake by Michael Essien. Gary Cahill leveled for Jose Mourinho's men early in the second half before John Terry marked his 400th league appearance for the Blues with a fine glancing header to put them ahead. Demba Ba rounded off the scoring in the final minute. City, so impressive at home to Tottenham last weekend, took their tally to 29 goals in seven home league games by beating Swansea 3-0 to go up to third. Alvaro Negredo and Samir Nasri with two second half strikes sealed the points for their side.","Martin Jol sacked by English Premier League Fulham .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is back. After battling a knee injury which threatened to derail his glittering career, the Spaniard is back on track and back on top following a 6-2 3-6 6-4 6-1 win over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the U.S. Open final. The second seed recovered from losing the second set and emerged victorious from an energy-sapping third to win his 13th grand slam and his 22nd consecutive hard-court match. The Mallorcan, who added the Flushing Meadows title to the French Open crown he clinched earlier this year, now trails only Pete Sampras (14) and his great rival Roger Federer (17) in the list of all-time major winners. He also now holds a significant lead over Djokovic in the race to end 2013 at the top of the world rankings. Not bad for a player whose ability to compete at the highest level was called into question in June after a straight-sets defeat to 135th-ranked Steve Darcis in the first round of Wimbledon. ""I never thought something like this could happen, I'm so excited to be back on tour trying to be competitive,"" Nadal told the U.S. Open's official website after avenging his final defeat to Djokovic in the 2011 final. ""But I never thought about competing for what I have competed for this year, all the Masters 1000s, two grand slams ... so it is just more than a dream for me. ""I'm very happy for everything.

""All the credit to him,"" said Djokovic after the 37th meeting between the two players. ""I had my momentum from midway through the second set to end of the third where I was supposed to use it and realize the opportunities that were presented to me. ""I didn't do it.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova has been forced out of the U.S. Open with a right shoulder injury, continuing a turbulent few months for the four-time grand slam winner. The world No. 3 is suffering from bursitis, which occurs when a small, fluid-filled sac forms under the skin. ""I have done everything I could since Wimbledon to get myself ready but it just wasn't enough time,"" Sharapova said in a statement released on her website. ""I have done many tests, received several opinions and it all comes down to taking the proper amount of time to heal my shoulder injury properly. It's certainly not an easy decision to make ahead of one of my favorite tournaments, but I know it's the right one that will get me back on the courts soon. ""I plan on taking the next few weeks off, receiving proper treatment and rehabilitation. I will miss being part of the US Open, but can't wait for next year."" After losing to Portuguese qualifier Michelle Larcher De Brito in the second round of Wimbledon in June, the Russian ended her three-year partnership with coach Thomas Hogstedt. She then hired legendary eight-time grand slam winner Jimmy Connors as his replacement, but that was ended after just one match, her second-round defeat to American starlet Sloane Stephens at the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati. The 2006 U.S. Open champion had reportedly agreed to have her father coach her throughout the year's final grand slam. Sharapova grabbed the headlines earlier this week amid suggestions she was set to change her name to ""Sugarpova"" for the duration of tournament, a marketing stunt designed to promote her candy range. Her representatives, however, told CNN that it would be ""too complicated."" In Sharapova's absence Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska will be instated as the third seed for Thursday's draw. Home fans suffered a blow with the news that American Mardy Fish has withdrawn from tournament as he continues to struggle with ongoing health issues. The former world No. 7 has been battling a heart condition which first came to light in May 2012 and required him to have surgery to correct faulty electrical connections within his heart. Fish has already missed the Australian and French Opens and Wimbledon this year. Earlier this week he was forced to withdraw from his match with Jarkko Nieminen at the Winston-Salem Open. ""Friends, unfortunately my health won't allow me to compete this year at the US Open. Thank you for all your support,"" the 31-year-old announced on his official Twitter account.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus weren't in the Cleveland courtroom Thursday for the sentencing of their captor, Ariel Castro. But their words, recorded in diaries, gave authorities a window into the horror they suffered for a decade. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty wrote about the diaries in a sentencing memo. Berry, DeJesus and Michelle Knight did ""everything humanly possible to retain a sense of normalcy"" McGinty said, including marking the passage of time through written diaries. The diaries provide further details of the women's life and torment. McGinty reveals that one diary's descriptions of abuse provided evidence his office used for many of the specific counts against Castro. Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts of kidnapping, rape and murder. Diaries kept by the women contain descriptions of these crimes, including sexual abuse, being locked in a dark room and being chained to a wall. McGinty says other entries contain anticipation of abuse yet to come, including Castro's death threats. But the diaries also showed traces of hope, including ""the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family."" Amanda Berry's entries focused on her mother, according to psychiatrist Frank Ochberg's assessment of the women's captivity as part of the sentencing statement. Ochberg, an expert in trauma, wrote that the diaries showed the women's ""will to prevail."" According to Ochberg, Berry addressed almost every entry in her diary to her mother. Berry's mother, Louwanna Miller, worked tirelessly to find her daughter. Miller died of heart failure in 2006; those who knew her said it was more like a broken heart. After Berry learned of her mother's death, she began addressing her entries to ""her mother in heaven."" The entries show Berry at once seeking to ""soothe her mother as she prayed for her own deliverance and the health of her little girl."" Berry's daughter, fathered by Castro, was born on Christmas Day of 2006. McGinty writes that ""when the baby was born she was not breathing. Michelle Knight breathed into the baby's mouth in an effort to save her."" A difficult endeavor, made more intense by Castro's threat to kill Knight should the baby die. ""Miraculously,"" McGinty writes, ""the baby survived."" The sentencing memo provides other descriptions of heroism. Ochberg says that Knight, in addition to serving as a de facto doctor to Berry, also ""interceded when Castro sought to abuse Gina."" An action, Ochberg says, that resulted in further physical and sexual trauma for Knight. Ochberg said that ""on rare occasions all four captives were allowed to be together and they managed to share faith and friendship."" He also noted that Berry managed to pass on knowledge and values to her daughter, something the other two women supported ""when possible."" But Ochberg says the bright moments, the remarkable and inspiring ones, should not ""paint a rosy picture for normalcy or quick recovery."" Castro, Ochberg writes, ""turned truth and commonsense on its head and fed that to his captives."" The beatings, the repeated rapes, the forced miscarriages and the deprivation of basic human sanitation led to complex post-traumatic stress disorder. ""It is the result of victimization over a long period of time,"" Ochberg says, ""or in the years when personality and character are being formed."" Castro ""appeared to be evolving in an ever more dangerous direction,"" Ochberg writes, ""capturing younger and younger women, telling his captives he was hunting for replacements."" The women must have known that any new captives would not have meant freedom -- rather they must have known, Ochberg concludes, ""replacement meant death.""","Diaries written by two of Ariel Castro's captives are detailed in a sentencing memo .

"London (CNN) -- Three ""extremely traumatized"" women are being cared for by a charity after managing to leave a London house where they had allegedly been held captive for more than 30 years. One of the women -- a 30-year-old Briton -- ""appears to have been in servitude for her entire life,"" Metropolitan Police Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland said. She and the other two women, a 57-year-old from Ireland and a 69-year-old from Malaysia, have been taken to a place of safety. Experts and charities explain how they might recover from their ordeal. How are the three women faring? A television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of Freedom Charity prompted one of the victims to call for help; that organization's founder Aneeta Prem told CNN the women were coping despite their ordeal. ""I've seen them on a number of occasions,"" she said. ""They're doing remarkably well considering how harrowing it's been for them. Every effort has been made to ensure they're being taken care of, but it's going to be a very long journey. ""Now we've heard of the arrests of the two people allegedly involved in this and that's going to be another journey in itself. It's going to be very difficult. We're really pleased with the work that we've done in partnership with the police and they're to be commended for taking this seriously."" How can victims of slavery or abuse be rehabilitated? Time is of the essence when suspected victims of slavery or imprisonment are rescued, and the first moments are known as the ""golden hour."" Ann Reed, anti-trafficking response co-ordinator for the Salvation Army which helps trafficking victims in the UK for the first 45 days, said it was very important to quickly give them back their self-worth. ""Many victims will have had no opportunity to make decisions for themselves, even down to the smallest things like when to sleep or what to eat. ""So it's important to put them on a road to recovery by giving them a safe environment, allowing them to choose when to eat and sleep, making them feel at home, offering them kindness and compassion."" It can be as basic as playing cards with the victims to put them at their ease, she said. Each case is different, with this latest being the most extreme one that Reed said she had ever heard about. ""I assume it will take many years for the victims in this case to recover, although we do not know the full details. It's a complete one-off."" How do people who have been held captive find resilience? Captives in similar situations draw strength from each other, Reed said, just as the three women who escaped this year after 11 years of sexual abuse in Cleveland, U.S., did. In that notorious case one of the victims, Michelle Knight, credited Gina DeJesus -- with whom she shared a dark room measuring about 7 feet by 11Â½ feet -- for saving her life. ""I never let her fall, and she never let me fall,"" Knight told the trial of her tormentor Ariel Castro. ""She nursed me back to health when I was dying from his abuse. My friendship with Gina is the only good thing to come from this situation."" She returned the favor, at a cost to herself, placing herself in between Castro and DeJesus, taking on physical and sexual abuse herself to protect her friend, said Frank Ochberg, a pioneer in trauma research who testified in the case. Being the oldest, Knight often served as doctor, nurse and pediatrician for Amanda Berry and the young child that Castro fathered. She acted as the midwife, when it was born, delivering Berry's baby in a plastic swimming pool. Somehow, Knight, Berry and DeJesus kept hope. As Knight said, ""We said we'll all get out alive some day and we did."" Castro was sentenced to life imprisonment but was later found hanging in his prison cell. How many more victims of domestic slavery are there? Authorities have rescued about 1,200 men and women in England and Wales since July 2011, according to the Salvation Army. Many of those victims have endured sexual abuse in brothels, forced labor or domestic servitude. UK Special Envoy for Human Trafficking Anthony Steen told CNN he was not surprised by this case as there were likely to be many cases of domestic slavery in the country. ""We don't know the number but we know it's pretty huge. Domestics are hidden away,"" he said. ""The difference between slavery when it was manifest in America -- as it was in England -- was that you could see it everywhere,"" Steen said. ""Since then having abolished it, it's grown, it's got bigger and bigger -- in fact they say it's between 10 and 20 times the size it was in the 1800s."" Steen said the largest number of people involved in slavery in Britain were in brothels, and that group was followed by men held against their will in debt bondage. ""Shadow City"" was the title of one recent report into human trafficking in London, which explored where the abuses were taking place. ""Increasingly the authorities and many residents in London know there is a criminal activity called human trafficking,"" it concluded. ""What they don't usually know, accurately, is what human trafficking actually constitutes and what forms are taking place around them. Most London residents imagine that it does not touch directly on their lives -- that the exploitation takes place in brothels run by foreign gangs controlling foreign women. But it's nearer than they think."" The Salvation Army's Ann Reed said if anyone had concerns about neighbors, they should contact police. Causes for suspicion could be if there were several people living in a house, people buying large amounts of food, inhabitants struggling physically or those who were malnourished. They may not go often, or be under the control of others. How do victims of domestic servitude live? Such victims often sleep on the floor in the kitchen, eat the leftover remains of the household and have no days off, Steen said. ""Domestic slavery is rampant particularly in the Middle East countries, in Africa and in Europe. By and large it's people who have had their passports removed, they have no pay and are exploited and used. ""It's not trafficking but slavery by any other word, except that you don't see it. The problem with this case is that you never know when it will appear: with millions of houses and people it's all behind closed doors. This exposes a problem in all western countries. It's not the police you should blame it's the next-door neighbor, but you don't know what to look for. ""These people will be damaged for life. They will never recover.""","A couple is alleged to have held three women captive in London for more than 30 years .

"(CNN) -- Money might not grow on trees, but what if it fell from the sky? That's the awesome scenario described by Bolivian authorities who say they seized more than $1 million this week after a white bag was tossed from an airplane in Santa Cruz. Anti-drug police first noticed a person signaling a plane, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The money was thrown out as the aircraft flew low. Interior Minister Carlos Romero characterized the operation, which took place Sunday, as a major blow against drug trafficking. It foiled attempts to set up a drug factory, he said in a statement. Bolivia is one of the world's largest producers of coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine. Three people were ""captured,"" and authorities also seized weapons and vehicles, the Interior Ministry said. An investigation is ongoing.","Three people were ""captured,"" and authorities also seized weapons and vehicles .

"(CNN) -- Matt Cordle's confession doesn't beat around the bush: ""I killed a man."" The Ohio man claims in a video posted on the Internet this week that he killed 61-year-old Vincent Canzani in a drunken-driving crash in June. ""I take full responsibility for everything I've done to Vincent and his family,"" Cordle says in the video. The 22-year-old has not been charged with any crime, but Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said Cordle is a suspect in the deadly crash and a grand jury will be asked to indict him for aggravated vehicular homicide. The video is well-produced and powerful. Cordle's face is blurred as he begins to tell his story about being out with friend, drinking heavily and losing control the night of June 22. Attorneys that he consulted with offered to help him avoid any punishment -- ""all I had to do was lie"" -- but he decided to come forward instead. And he wants his video to be a warning to others. ""I can't bring Mr. Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've done, but you can still be saved, your victims can still be saved,"" he says on the video. When he gets charged, he will plead guilty, Cordle added. The video was posted on a website called ""because I said I would,"" which provides a forum for people to make promises to others. The founder of the website, Alex Sheen, said Cordle reached out to him via Facebook. ""There are a lot of emotions and parties at play here, so we stay in touch as much as possible,"" Sheen said. ""Matt is doing as well as he can. He's upset that people are calling his act of confession 'courageous' rather than focusing on the real issue: drinking and driving kills innocent people."" Cordle's current lawyer, George Breitmayer, told CNN affiliate WBNS he did not know beforehand that the video would be released. ""The video he released is a testament to both his integrity and his character, and I know that he intends to fully cooperate throughout the tenancy of all these proceedings,"" Breitmayer said. The crash . Canzani was driving a Jeep when he was struck by a wrong-way driver on I-670 near Columbus, according to the Columbus Dispatch. A Toyota Tundra was driving in the wrong direction and hit the Jeep about 3 a.m. Canzani was declared dead at the scene. The newspaper story did not name Cordle. The victim . Canzani was a veteran and gifted photographer, according to his obituary. He studied at Columbus College of Art and Design and served in the Navy as a missile technician in the Naval Submarine Service from 1980 to 1986, the obituary states. CNN's Pamela Brown and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","An Ohio man says he killed another man in a drunken driving incident .

"(CNN) -- Globe-trotters everywhere, it's time to raise your champagne glass and toast to all the wonderful new journeys you'll take in the new year. But where exactly should you go in 2012? As always, some places will stand out above the rest when it comes to unforgettable things to do and see. To help you decide, we sought out recommendations from four travel experts: Robert Reid, U.S. travel editor for Lonely Planet; Martin Rapp, senior vice president of leisure sales at Altour; Anne Banas, executive editor at SmarterTravel; and Jeanenne Tornatore, senior editor for Orbitz.com. We also sprinkled in a couple of suggestions from Travel+Leisure and Budget Travel. Here are nine of the top destinations for 2012: . England . The royal wedding made it one of the world's most buzzed about destinations this year, but England is about to get even hotter. There will be so much going on in 2012 that it's hard to keep count. The country will celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee -- marking her 60 years on the throne -- with a river pageant on the Thames and a concert at Buckingham Palace at the beginning of June. Then all eyes will be on London as it hosts the Summer Olympic Games in July and August, and the Paralympic Games in August and September. Looking for more? There will be festivals, tours, performances and exhibitions to mark the 200th birthday of Charles Dickens. ""I love London. I think it's kind of the greatest city on Earth,"" Reid said. ""A lot of people think it's too expensive but ... there are all kinds of fantastic free attractions in London, so it makes it more affordable than you think."" Lonely Planet: 20 free attractions in London . Banas predicted travelers will have more choices than ever to stay in and get around the city, with new lodging options and better transportation in place for the Olympics. World of the Maya . Some see it as an approaching apocalypse, others as the beginning of a new era. Whatever your beliefs are about December 21, 2012, interest is skyrocketing in the Maya, the ancient civilization known for the great cities it left behind in Mexico and Central America. The date marks the end of a 5,126-year cycle on the Long Count calendar developed by the Maya, and there will be events on the occasion in Belize, Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras, Banas said. If you want to see incredible ruins, Reid recommended skipping the tourist hordes at Tulum and Chichen Itza in Mexico and instead head to places such as Tikal, Guatemala (which George Lucas used as a location in the original ""Star Wars""), and Chiapas, Mexico. Reid was once exploring a site near Comitan, Mexico, and said he was astonished to discover he was the only person there. ""I had a pyramid to myself,"" Reid said. ""You're just looking out over this mountainous valley, and you have the complete Mayan site to yourself. It's an unreal travel experience."" Myanmar (also known as Burma) U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said this month that she sees signs the country -- ruled by a military junta for almost 50 years -- may genuinely be opening up. The changes mean tourists who didn't feel they could support the regime can finally start planning a trip to Myanmar, Rapp said. ""It is extraordinary,"" he said. ""It is really as close to authentic and unspoiled as you can get in that part of the world."" Reid also found it unforgettable. ""There's really no place in the world that you will find sweeter, more welcoming people,"" Reid said. Rapp suggested starting the journey in Yangon (once known as Rangoon) and staying at either the Governor's Residence or The Strand. Don't miss ""extraordinary"" Inle Lake, he added, where you can stay at the Golden Island Cottages. Chicago . The Windy City will be prominent on the world stage in 2012, hosting the 12th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in April, and both the NATO and Group of Eight summits in May, Tornatore noted. Golf fans will also descend on a country club just outside the city for the Ryder Cup in September. But even if you're not planning to be there for any big event, Chicago is ready for an influx of visitors from all over the world during 2012. ""Chicago is a huge tourist destination in its own right,"" Tornatore said, citing the city's museums, major sports teams and shopping. St. Vincent and the Grenadines . What's not to like about a tropical paradise that bills itself as ""one destination, 32 gorgeous Caribbean islands""? Located between St. Lucia and Grenada, this island chain has long drawn stars and vacationers with deep pockets, but it will become more accessible to a wider range of travelers thanks to a $240 million airport scheduled to open on St. Vincent, Travel + Leisure reports. Travel + Leisure: Hottest travel destinations of 2012 . The Netherlands . Flower lovers who flock to the country's stunning fields of tulips and who have made the colorful Keukenhof gardens one of the most popular attractions in the Netherlands will get an extra treat next year at the Floriade. The horticultural expo, staged once every 10 years, showcases the world's best flowers, plants, trees, fruits and vegetables. ""This is a once in a decade flower show so it's even more spectacular than Keukenhof, and Keukenhof is already amazing,"" Banas said. ""It actually runs from April all the way through October, so there's a pretty wide range of time that you can go and see this."" The expo is expected to attract 2 million visitors. Atlantic Canada . Canada's Maritime Provinces are always a beautiful destination, but the region will be in the spotlight next year as it commemorates its connection to the Titanic and the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking. After the Titanic struck an iceberg on the night of April 14, 1912, three ships were dispatched from Halifax, Nova Scotia -- the closest major port -- to bring back the bodies of the victims. Some of the passengers were laid to rest in the city's cemeteries. Halifax is planning lots of events to mark the anniversary, including a town parade, concerts and a film festival, Budget Travel reports. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic -- which has a huge collection of wooden Titanic artifacts, including a deck chair -- will have a temporary exhibit on the crews involved in the Titanic recovery effort. Budget Travel: Top budget travel destinations for 2012 . Uruguay . There are extraordinary hotels opening in this South American country, which has stayed below the radar for many tourists, Rapp said. ""People don't know it ... so it's a real find,"" he said. ""I rode horses, because the horseback riding is superb. The beaches are completely unspoiled."" He recommended checking out the art-filled Playa Vik and the Estancia Vik as well as the Hotel Fasano in the seaside resort of Punta del Este. Orlando . Reid conceded some people might think of this choice as ""ridiculous,"" but he called Orlando a legitimate surprise. ""By Orlando, I refer to Orlando the city,"" he said. ""Local Orlando (residents) will tell you that the amusement park scene has no connection to the city itself."" The metropolis most people breeze by as they head to Disney World will transform into celebrity central as it hosts the 61st NBA All-Star Game in February. Reid advised travelers to check out the city's lakes, museums and scenic neighborhoods, including the bohemian Milk District. He also praised Orlando's food scene. ""There's this very big, wonderful, authentic, fantastic and tasty Vietnamese restaurant community called ViMi -- it's more authentic Vietnamese restaurants than you find in New York or San Francisco,"" he said.","Travel experts name nine great destinations to explore next year .
England will host the Olympic Games, celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Friends and family of actress Farrah Fawcett -- including longtime partner Ryan O'Neal and their son Redmond, who was temporarily freed from jail for the service -- gathered Tuesday to say goodbye. Actress Farrah Fawcett, known for her blond mane and gleaming smile, died Thursday at age 62. Fawcett, the blond-maned actress whose best-selling poster and ""Charlie's Angels"" stardom made her one of the most famous faces in the world, died Thursday. She was 62, and had suffered from anal cancer off and on for three years. Tuesday's service at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles was private and closed to the media. The family did not release details about the service, but ""Charlie's Angels"" co-star Kate Jackson and former model Cheryl Tiegs were among those seen entering. Ryan O'Neal helped carry Fawcett's casket from the hearse into the church. Fawcett's beauty -- her gleaming smile was printed on millions of posters -- initially made her famous. But she later established herself as a serious actress. She starred as a battered wife in the 1984 TV movie ""The Burning Bed,"" and appeared on stage as a woman who extracts vengeance from a would-be rapist in William Mastrosimone's play ""Extremities,"" a performance she reprised on film in 1986. Other Fawcett films include ""Logan's Run"" (1976), ""Saturn 3"" (1980), ""The Cannonball Run"" (1981), ""The Apostle"" (1997) and the Robert Altman-directed ""Dr. T and the Women"" (2000). But to many, Fawcett will always be best known for her red-swimsuited image on the pinup poster, which sold a reputed 12 million copies after its release in 1976. Redmond O'Neal, 24, was arrested in September when deputies found methamphetamine during a probation search at the Malibu, California, home of his father, Ryan O'Neal. The younger O'Neal was on probation for a 2008 felony drug conviction involving heroin and methamphetamine. Monday's court order allowed Redmond O'Neal out of jail for up to three hours for the funeral. A sheriff's deputy was to accompany him at all times, according to the order, issued in Los Angeles County Superior Court. O'Neal was allowed to wear civilian clothes for the funeral. iReport.com: Fawcett's funeral 'heartbreaking' He is undergoing what the sheriff's department has called an ""intense drug rehabilitation program"" in the Los Angeles county jail.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For six mornings each week Hong Kong's Aberdeen fish market is one of the busiest places in an already hyperactive city. Fishing boats unload their catch: still thrashing live fish caught in the South China Sea and more tropical waters further afield. From the murky holding tanks they're soon dispatched in lorries to feed the city's hearty appetite for live seafood. Around 30 tons each day are landed at the Aberdeen market alone, according to the Hong Kong's Fish Marketing Organization, with six other live fish markets dotted across the territory. But while the market continues to do brisk business, the livelihood of the city's fishermen has been in slow decline for years. ""It's quite hard to do business now because there is not much supply,"" says fisherman Mr Lee, proudly holding up his prize catch, a grouper large enough to make a dining table groan. ""We now do one trip only, with little supply we cannot even out the cost. There is not much fish in the sea."" The specimen he was showing off came from thousands of miles away. That alone tells the story. Hong Kong's territorial waters have severely depleted since the 1980s, according to the environmental group WWF. Although being close to fished out for years, it was only in January of this year that a five-year ban on trawling in Hong Kong waters came into effect. Championed by environmental groups, it's proved controversial among some of the trawler owners and the fishermen and families that rely on the fishing fleet. The trawlers can still fish outside the banned area, but many of the vessels with their characteristic high bows remain idle in port with their nets folded; their owners and crew relying on a slice of a $200 million government compensation fund. Even if fishing stocks do recover, many are doubtful the traditional way of life -- a part of Hong Kong's culture for as long as the city has existed -- will ever really return. Preserving heritage . Cheng Wah Ming was a lifelong fisherman who saw out many stormy periods in the industry until 2004, when he swapped the high seas to join the Lamma Fisherfolk Village, located a few kilometers from Hong Kong's main island. In place of nets and rigging, he now has buckets of fish feed at the fish farm and education center. ""From what I remember, in the 1950s and 1960s, the fishermen population in Hong Kong was close to 100,000. Now I believe it's less than 10,000,"" he says. Citing numerous reasons for the decline -- from fuel prices to declining stocks and the unstable income from fishing -- Cheng fears the recent ban could prove a final nail in the coffin of the local industry, one he wishes will be preserved as much as possible. ""I hope that people who have the passion can continue to work in the fishing industry. Hong Kong was a small fishing port and has now developed and become an international financial center. Not a lot of people know about Hong Kong's fishing history and culture, so I think this project is worth trying."" Farming for the future . Appetites won't abate for seafood and fish farming seems to be the answer. Around 70%-80% of fish sold at Aberdeen fish market already comes from fish farms and aquaculture facilities, mostly around mainland China. Making aquaculture environmentally sound is another issue; much of the feed for fish farms comes from live caught ""trash fish"" -- the price of which has increased in Hong Kong since the trawling ban. High-tech schemes, like OceanEthix indoor fish farm technology, housed on the 15th floor of a skyscraper 30 miles from the sea, offer some ingenious solutions to aquaculture's problems of sustainability and quality. Using vast tanks to grow out valuable fish for the restaurant trade, the company has developed a method where the water is recycled and fish feed comes from sustainable sources, not trash fish. The demand for its fish, like live coral grouper, is in good health says Lloyd Moskalik, managing director of OceanEthix, but making it as affordable or cheaper than other products will be key to its success. ""In the long term the fishermen of Hong Kong don't have much of a future,"" Moskalik says. ""There's a lot of lip service from wholesalers about a sustainable product, but really it comes down to the price mechanism.""","Hong Kong ban on trawling puts emphasis on aquaculture to meet growing demand for seafood .
Fish farms provide around 70% of fish to local wholesale markets .
Many fear the traditional fisherman's life will soon be a thing of the past .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has fired Vice Premier Qadri Jamil ""due to his absence from office without notice,"" state television reported Tuesday. Jamil had carried out ""unauthorized meetings abroad without coordinating with the government,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said. A senior State Department official said that U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford met Saturday with Jamil in Geneva, Switzerland. ""We meet lots of Syrians of all political backgrounds,"" the official said. ""We're not going to give a list, but we do regularly meet Syrians with direct contacts with the regime in Damascus."" He added, ""We are clear: There is no military solution for either side. There needs to be a political negotiation for a new, transitional governing body chosen by mutual consent with full executive powers."" Jamil represents the Popular Front for Change and Liberation, which is part of the ""internal opposition"" formed by the government of Bashar al-Assad as part of a series of superficial measures intended to mollify its critics over the last two years. The announcement came on the same day the Syrian Arab News Agency reported that Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem met with U.N. Envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi and discussed efforts to hold an international conference on Syria in Geneva. ""Minister al-Moallem affirmed that Syria will participate in the conference on the basis of the Syrian people's exclusive right to decide upon their political future and choosing their leadership, rejecting any form of foreign interference, and having the dialogue in Geneva be between Syrians and led by Syria,"" SANA reported.

"(CNN) -- The hottest field in science this past decade has been neuroscience. That explosion in research, and our understanding of the human brain, was largely fueled by a new technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that became widely available in the 1990s. Well look out! Another technology-based neuroscience revolution is in the making, this one perhaps even bigger. The term to watch for in 2013 is ""optogenetics."" It's not a sexy term, but it is a very sexy technology. The heritage of optogenetics goes way back to 1979, when Nobel Laureate Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with James Watson and Rosalind Franklin, suggested that neuroscientists should seek to learn how to take control of specific cells in the brain. Well, that certainly would seem to be an advance with great potential. Imagine being able to turn the neurons in an animal's brain on and off from the outside. Sounds like you'd be turning the creature into a robot, sounds like science fiction. Right? Well, flash forward thirty-some years, and guess what, optogenetics is a reality! Here's how it works... roughly. An obvious approach would be to stick a tiny electrode into an animal's brain and stimulate the cells using electricity. Today we have tiny microelectrodes, but they are still too crude for the job. Crick speculated that light could be the tool to use. That turned out to be true: Optogenetics involves inserting fiber-optics tools into an animal's brain, in order to control the target neurons using pulses of light as a trigger. Learning to shine light on a neuron is not the whole answer, though. In order for the method to work, the neurons have to be re-engineered so that they react to the light. That was made possible by the amazing discovery of a kind of protein that can be used to turn neurons on and off in response to light. The exotic light-sensitive protein is not present in normal neurons, so scientists designed a way to insert it. That is accomplished through a type of gene engineering called ""transfection"" that employs ""vectors"" such as viruses to infect the target neuron, and, once there, to insert genetic material that will cause the neuron to manufacture the light-sensitive protein. Put it all together, and you have that sci-fi-sounding technology: genetically-engineered neurons that you can turn on and off at will, inside the brain of a living and freely-moving animal. It is the combined use of optics and genetics that give optogenetics its name, but it's not the ""how"" that makes optogenetics exciting, it is the ""what."" Scientists didn't really develop it to ""take over"" a creature's brain. They developed it, like fMRI, to learn about the brain, and how the brain works, in this case by studying the effect of stimulating specific types of neurons. The technology is already beginning to pay off, and despite its recent invention, the word on the street is that a Nobel Prize isn't far off. In one application of optogenetics, scientists investigated how neurons that make dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain, may give rise to feelings of reward and pleasure. That work may help scientists understand the pleasure-related pathologies involved in clinical depression. In another application, scientists selectively stimulated brain cells in animal models of Parkinson's disease, a disease that involves the disruption of information-processing in the brain. That research gave new insight into the circuitry involved in the disease, and the way that the therapies we currently prescribe for it operate. It has also suggested new directions for therapeutic intervention. Schizophrenia is another disorder that involves information processing issues in the brain. The illusion of hearing voices, for example, may arise from the failure of an internal mechanism for notifying a person when his or her thoughts are ""self-generated."" Optogenetics has been employed to better understand a kind of brain activity called ""gamma oscillations"" that appear abnormal in schizophrenia -- and also in autism. Today, we are a long way from the era when a single person working with an assistant or two can make a revolutionary technological breakthrough. It took, instead, decades of work in many fields, which came together, only very recently, to bring Crick's vision to fruition. But now that it's here, optogenetics is destined to change the way we treat mental illness, and eventually, even, the way we understand ourselves as human beings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leonard Mlodinow.","Leonard Mlodinow: In 2013, ""optogenetics"" is the technology to watch out for .

"(CNN) -- At least 30 Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia were killed in a joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces Saturday, officials said. The operation targeted an Al-Shabaab hideout in Kolbio, Somalia, Col. Cyrus Oguna of the Kenyan Defense Force said. The al Qaeda-linked Islamist group has been connected to the attack in Nairobi's Westgate mall last month where 67 people were killed. Saturday's raid follows another operation earlier in the week, where Kenyan warplanes targeted a militant training camp inside Somalia. Kenyan officials say the terror group has used camps to train operatives, including attackers who targeted Westgate mall.","At least 30 militants are killed in the joint operation .

"(CNN) -- When Rickie Fowler was named the PGA Tour's rookie of the year in 2010, the groundswell of opinion outside the U.S. was that the award should have gone to another young golfing prodigy -- Rory McIlroy. While the Northern Irishman went on to win his first major title in 2011, and climbed to the top of the world rankings this year, Fowler had been hanging on the cusp of his own breakthrough. Until Sunday, that is, when the 23-year-old claimed his first PGA Tour title at the same Quail Hollow venue where McIlroy made his mark two years ago with a stunning final-round 62 that secured his maiden U.S. victory. Clad in his trademark bright orange outfit, his shock of hair barely contained by his hat, and a mustache nestling above his top lip that any 1970s detective would be proud of, Fowler produced his own moment of magic to beat McIlroy and fellow American D.A. Points in a playoff at the Wells Fargo Championship. Woods misses halfway cut at Quail Hollow . His stunning wedge shot to within four feet of the hole at the tricky 18th, which had given up only four birdies all day, earned him the $1.17 million first prize and lifted him to 15th in the FedEx Cup standings and 24th in the world rankings. ""For Rickie to go out and play that hole the way he did, he deserved to win,"" said McIlroy, who returned to world No. 1 above Englishman Luke Donald after taking home $572,000 in consolation. ""He probably has gone through a little bit of sort of scrutiny and a lot of pressure trying to get that first win, but now that win is out of the way. Hopefully that'll ease the pressure a little bit."" Fowler, who was the world's top amateur for 36 weeks, lost a playoff in his second tournament as a professional and has been runner-up three times on the main U.S. tour. Rested McIlroy returns to PGA Tour . ""It's nice to kind of shut them up a little bit,"" he said on the PGA Tour website. ""It's going to be kind of a relief. It's been a wait, but I'm definitely still young, and hopefully this opens the door to many more. But it's nice to be mentioned as a PGA Tour winner. ""It's still going to be almost like having zero when someone like Phil (Mickelson) is getting announced with 40 and I've got one. I've got some work to do."" When Fowler lines up at this week's prestigious Players Championship, he will again be playing without one of his closest golfing friends -- Masters champion Bubba Watson, who skipped Quail Hollow to be with his wife and newly-adopted son and has also decided to sit out golf's ""fifth major."" Final leaderboard at Wells Fargo Championship . Watson and Fowler make up half of golf's only boy band, the Golf Boys, along with Ben Crane and FedEx Cup leader Hunter Mahan. ""I'm bummed that Bubba wasn't around,"" said Fowler, who helped Watson celebrate after his Masters playoff victory in April. ""We weren't exactly inside the ropes but we had a front-row seat, and just to see how he handled himself, the shots he hit, just to feel the energy ... definitely being around there gave me the kind of want to win more."" It's not the first time Fowler has beaten McIlroy -- he did so by six shots in his only other professional win in a Korean event last year. ""Rory is the top-ranked young player right now, I'm probably the one that sticks out most with color,"" Fowler said. ""Now I'm a PGA Tour winner, so I've got some credibility."" Fowler played in the 2010 Ryder Cup defeat against Europe, and Sunday's victory has lifted his hopes of playing in the U.S. team for this year's match in Medinah, Illinois. Meanwhile, another player who made his Ryder Cup debut two years ago, Francesco Molinari, boosted his chance of a second appearance in September by winning the European Tour's Spanish Open on Sunday. The Italian, whose brother Edoardo halved with Fowler in singles play at Celtic Manor in 2010, moved up to 10th place on the European Ryder Cup standings after winning by three shots in Seville. The 29-year-old took home â‚¬333,330 ($435,000) after clinching his first title in 18 months, and climbed to 29th in the world rankings.","Rickie Fowler wins his first PGA Tour title in playoff at Wells Fargo Championship .

"(CNN) -- Every new day seems to bring new revelations and reactions to the controversial electronic surveillance programs. On Monday, self-avowed leaker Edward Snowden reportedly is to participate in a live Internet chat about his actions. Over the weekend we learned that the British electronic intelligence agency tried to monitor delegates during a G-20 summit. We also heard from administration officials, past and present, who tried to assuage Americans worried about privacy. Here is a summary of the latest developments: . Snowden to chat with Guardian readers . Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor behind the leaks, will answer the public's questions Monday in a live online chat, according to the UK-based Guardian newspaper. The chat, conducted by the Guardian, is set to begin at 11 a.m. ET. ""An important caveat: the live chat is subject to Snowden's security concerns and also his access to a secure Internet connection,"" the Guardian's website read Monday morning. ""It is possible that he will appear and disappear intermittently, so if it takes him a while to get through the questions, please be patient."" Snowden to hold online chat . More details are coming . NSA Director Keith Alexander is expected to release details of cases where the programs have stopped a terrorist attack, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said. The information may be available as soon as Monday. ""He wants to be exact about the details,"" she said. Over the weekend a three-page document on the NSA programs was released to congressional intelligence committees and states the plots were thwarted in the United States and more than 20 other countries. Intelligence community provides fuller justification for data collection . China: Snowden not our spy . The Chinese foreign ministry said Monday that suggestions that Snowden may have spied for China were ""completely groundless."" Speaking at a regular news briefing, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said it was up to the United States to provide an explanation of Snowden's actions to the international community. Snowden is currently believed to be in Hong Kong, where he has said he plans to stay and fight any attempt to extradite him back to the United States. His exact whereabouts are unknown. Over the weekend, Former Vice President Dick Cheney described Snowden as a ""traitor."" Asked if he thought Snowden was spying for China, Cheney said he was ""deeply suspicious."" White House: No violations of privacy . The president's chief of staff said Sunday that his boss doesn't feel he has violated the privacy of any American. ""He does not,"" Denis McDonough said when asked directly if Barack Obama feels that way about the government's controversial surveillance programs. On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" McDonough added the president plans to ""talk about this in the days ahead."" McDonough said the president will emphasize the need to ""find the right balance, especially in this new situation where we find ourselves with all of us reliant on Internet, on e-mail, on texting."" McDonough said he does not know where Snowden went after he checked out of his Hong Kong hotel a week ago. White House: Obama not violating privacy; Snowden's whereabouts unknown . Congressman: No recording going on here . The chairman of the House intelligence committee echoed the White House, saying that the National Security Agency is not recording Americans' phone calls under U.S. surveillance programs. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the NSA ""is not listening to Americans' phone calls"" or monitoring their e-mails. The NSA has repeatedly said that it collects only metadata, phone numbers and duration, of phone calls, but not the actual conversations taking place. If it needs to listen to a conversation, it must first obtain an order from the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court. Rogers: NSA 'is not listening' to Americans' phone calls . Cantor: Programs strike balance between security, liberty . The House majority leader said on CNN's ""New Day"" Monday morning that he believes congressional hearings will show that not only have the programs helped authorities go after terrorists, but also that they take the protection of civil liberties into account. ""I think the discussion that will unfold through our committee process, the oversight hearings, (is) going to be able to demonstrate that,"" Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said. ""These programs hopefully will be proven to strike that balance that's so necessary in our country."" Cheney: NSA surveillance programs are a good thing . Former Vice President Dick Cheney vehemently defended the National Security Agency surveillance programs that started under President George W. Bush, but said current White House scandals like Benghazi and the IRS have hurt its credibility. ""I think it's important to separate out that program from the scandals,"" he told CNN. ""It's done great work, it has saved lives, stopped attacks against the United States, and it's vital to continue."" Earlier, Cheney told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he believed the programs could have prevented 9/11 if they had been in place before the attack. Cheney defends NSA, calls Obama's credibility 'nonexistent' Everyone is doing it . Britain's electronic intelligence agency monitored delegates' phones and tried to capture their passwords during an economic summit held there in 2009, the Guardian newspaper reported Sunday. The targets included British allies such as Turkey and South Africa, the newspaper reported. The Guardian cited documents provided by Edward Snowden, the American computer analyst and former government contractors now spilling secrets of the U.S. intelligence community. The British signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, is the UK equivalent of the National Security Agency. New report: Britain spied on G-20 delegates in 2009 . Hong Kong demonstrators support Snowden . On the run from the United States, Snowden has picked up hundreds of supporters in Hong Kong, the last place he was seen and where he's still believed to be hiding out. Demonstrators took to Hong Kong's streets in the rain on Saturday voicing support for the 29-year-old computer technician. Snowden has said his intention was to ""ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate."" The protesters chanted ""Protect Snowden!"" and ""NSA has no say!""

"(CNN) -- On Monday, as he remained hospitalized for injuries incurred during a massive manhunt and a pair of shootouts last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev heard from his hospital bed his Miranda rights being read, and then he heard read the federal charges now filed against him in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings. The 19-year-old faces charges of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, and of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. What follows is a chronology produced by FBI special agent Daniel Genck, who is part of a Boston counterterrorism squad and who based his re-telling of events on crime scene photographs and video, as well information he gleaned from other officers as well as from his own involvement in the case. Read the complaint . Genck said he is not divulging all of the details he has, just what is necessary to establish the following. As told via the criminal complaint: . At 2:38 p.m. on Monday, April 15, roughly 11 minutes prior to the first blast, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are caught on camera turning onto Boylston Street, the thoroughfare where the finish line is located. Tamerlan Tsarnaev is wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses, a white shirt, dark coat and tan pants. His little brother is wearing a gray hoodie, a black jacket and dark pants. He also has a white baseball cap, turned backward on his head. The pair walks east, toward the Boston Marathon finish line, Tamerlan Tsarnaev in front of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, wearing a knapsack on his back. 5 key questions . The two are seen standing about a half-block from Forum restaurant, the site of the second explosion, at about 2:41 p.m. A minute later, Tamerlan Tsarnaev begins walking toward the finish line again. He still has his knapsack. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev begins walking toward the finish line at about 2:45 p.m. He has his right thumb hooked under his backpack strap and there's a phone in his left hand. He stops in front of Forum. He's near the metal barricades separating spectators from the marathon contestants, standing with his back to the cameras. ""He then can be seen apparently slipping his knapsack onto the ground. A photograph taken from the opposite side of the street shows the knapsack on the ground at (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's) feet."" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev stays at this location for about four minutes, looking at his cell phone and ""once appearing to take a picture with it."" About 30 seconds before the first blast, he lifts the phone to his head and speaks for about 18 seconds. He finishes the call, and the first explosion goes off within seconds. ""Virtually"" everyone along Boylston turns toward the finish line, ""in apparent bewilderment and alarm,"" but not Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He appears calm. ""He glances to the east and then calmly but rapidly begins moving to the west, away from the direction of the finish line. He walks away without his knapsack, having left it on the ground where he had been standing. Aunt reveals clues to older Boston brother's trip to Russia . ""Approximately 10 seconds later, an explosion occurs in the location where (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) had placed his knapsack."" Like Tamerlan Tsarnaev's bag, the knapsack is placed along a metal barrier. It's about a block from the first explosion. Subsequent investigation shows that both bombs used in the marathon attack were ""low-grade explosives that were housed in pressure cookers."" The pressure cookers contained nails and BBs, and the bombs had ""green-colored hobby fuse."" On Thursday, the FBI distributes photos and videos of the brothers, which are widely broadcast by media outlets. Just before midnight, a man is sitting in his car on a road in Cambridge when a man taps on the passenger-side window. The driver rolls down the window, and the man lets himself into the car, points a firearm and says, ""Did you hear about the Boston explosion? ... I did that."" He then shows the driver that his gun is loaded. ""I am serious,"" the man says before forcing the victim to drive to another location where they pick up a second man. The armed man takes the driver's keys and sits in the driver's seat, while the kidnapped man moves to the passenger seat. The second man enters the back seat, and he and the driver begin talking in a foreign language. They begin driving, and the man with the gun demands money. He is given $45 but wants more and demands an ATM card and password. They go to an ATM machine, where the men attempt to get money, before going to a gas station, where the captive man escapes. In runners' tent and ER, a rush to save limbs and lives . Police later locate the stolen vehicle in Watertown, a suburb west of the city, and give chase. As they attempt to elude law enforcement, the Tsarnaev brothers throw two small bombs out of the car. A gunfight ensues, and Tamerlan is severely injured and left at the scene, while his brother escapes. Police later find the car abandoned with an ""intact low-grade explosive device"" inside. Federal agents recover two more bombs at the site of the shootout. The bombs resemble those used in the marathon bombings. One even utilizes the same brand of pressure cooker. On Friday evening, police learn that an individual is inside a covered boat in Watertown. After a shootout, police apprehend the man and search him. He has a university ID card, credit cards and other forms of IDs which say he is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Due to wounds in his head, neck, legs and hand, he is transported to a hospital. On Sunday, police search Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dormitory room and recover a ""large pyrotechnic"" as well as a black jacket and white hat similar to the one Dzhokhar is seen wearing just before the explosions at the marathon.","An FBI special agent re-creates the Boston Marathon bombing, ensuing manhunt last week .

"London (CNN) -- Emmelie de Forest carried Denmark to triumph early Sunday in the Eurovision Song Contest, an annual musical spectacle known for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs and international rivalries. Flanked by marching drummers in military-style uniforms and performing in bare feet, de Forest took top spot with a breathy performance of ""Only Teardrops."" Millions of people across Europe and beyond tuned in to watch pop acts from 26 countries take to the stage in the Swedish city of Malmo. Dressed like a new-age Tinker Bell, 20-year-old de Forest bested a field that included the UK contender and 1980s hit-maker Bonnie Tyler. Azerbaijan's Farid Mammadov finished second with the song ""Hold Me,"" and the Ukraine's Zlata Ognevich took third with ""Gravity."" What is Eurovision? Tyler, known for her hits ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" and ""Holding Out for a Hero,"" finished in 19th place.

Demark was considered one of the favorites among bookmakers going into the final on Saturday night. Five nations -- France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom -- get an automatic entry to the final because they are the biggest financial contributors. The previous year's winner also automatically qualifies, as the host nation.

"(CNN) -- Instead of opining on the proposed deal with Iran taking shape in Geneva, let's decode it. From the reported outline of the proposal, we learn four things: . 1) Iran remains intensely committed to achieving a nuclear weapon. Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, promised his countrymen relief from international sanctions. Since coming into office this summer, he has made various conciliatory noises. Was he readying Iran for a real deal? The message of Geneva is: No, no real deal. Iran's red line at Geneva, the thing it would not trade away, was a capacity to continue and resume nuclear bomb development at any time. Iran's offer at Geneva amounted to a six-month delay of its nuclear program that will not in any way impair its ability to get back to bomb-making at any time. Iran won't neutralize or surrender any of its fissile material; that is, material used to fuel reactorsâ€”or nuclear bombs. It won't disable any of its nuclear facilities. It will only pause. Economists use the phrase ""revealed preference"" to describe the way in which our actions indicate our priorities. Iran's priority remains gaining a weapon; post-Geneva, there can be no doubt about that. 2) The Iranian economy has collapsed into desperate condition. At Geneva, Iran gained a promise of the potential release of $3 billion in frozen international reserves and the right to import potentially up to $9.5 billion of gold. For a major oil producing nation, these should be petty sums. (Iraq's oil revenues amounted to about $7 billion per month in 2013.) Iran itself holds title to an estimated $80 billion of international reserves. The Kirk-Menendez sanctions passed by Congress at the end of last year, then reluctantly accepted by the Obama administration, have effectively denied Iran the use of these funds. Any bank anywhere in the world that deals with Iran will be cut off from the international payments system. If Iran earns $1 billion inside a sanctions-busting country, it must either buy goods worth $1 billion inside that country or else find a way to physically move that much cash -- assuming the sanctions-busting country has that much physical cash, which few do. (A billion dollars in cash would fill all the carrying space on a large truck.) A study conducted for the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies by Roubini Global Economics estimates that Iran's actual on-hand, accessible foreign reserves have dwindled below $20 billion, and maybe further. This amount could cover only three months worth of minimally essential imports, a level that would normally be considered a warning of crisis ahead. In Iran's case, however, the crisis has already arrived. In just the past two years, the rial has plunged from 10,800 to the dollar to about 32,000 to the dollar. Prices have soared, and goods have vanished from Iran's shelves. By any usual definition of the word ""desperate,"" Iran desperately needs a deal on its nuclear program. If Iran still won't yield, that is one more confirmation of point 1. 3) The Obama administration wants an Iranian nuclear deal more than Iran does. By most reports, it was the United States that came to Geneva armed with proposals, and Iran that did most of the refusing. As Eli Lake and Josh Rogin reported in the Daily Beast last week, the Obama administration began relaxing sanctions simply to get talks started. Iran, by contrast, has offered no such concessions to the United States. Since the breakdown of the talks last week, Iran has insisted on its willingness to walk away if it does not gain a deal to its liking. Secretary of State John Kerry - by contrast again - has blitzed the media, defending the agreement as better than nothing at all. Iran is the country more willing to live with the failure of the talks. Its worst-case scenario at Geneva is more sanctions, more economic privation, more public discontent, and more need for political repression. This last is not an outcome that need frighten the regime very much: The mullahs crushed protests in 2003 and 2009 and there's no reason to doubt that they can crush any future protest equally effectively. The Obama administration seems much more frightened of its worst-case outcome: the need to use military force to stop the Iranian nuclear program. Compared with that scenario, it seems to prefer any deal, no matter how flimsy or one-sided. And the Iranians seem to understand that preference. 4) America's allies are not deferring to American leadership on this one. It's not only France that has rebelled against the outlined deal in Geneva. Israel is protesting vocally and publicly; America's Gulf Arab allies are protesting less publicly, but nearly equally vocally. On ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Kerry insisted that there was ""zero gap"" between the United States and its regional allies. Then he immediately got on a plane to the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, presumably to try to upgrade his Sunday talk-show words into something closer to reality. Just in case, though, the UAE will also be buying $4 billion worth of U.S. munitions -- its own private line of defense against a threatening Iran and the turmoil that will ensue if America's deal-at-all-costs mentality compels Israel to strike Iran on its own. As of today, you have to guess that it's that latter scenario that looks like the most likely outcome of American over-eagerness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says no real deal with Iran came out of Geneva .
Iran still wants a nuclear weapon, he says .
United States is more interested in a deal than Iran, Frum says ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A cache of e-mails believed lost when Michael Jackson's last manager's laptop disappeared could become key evidence in the wrongful death trial against AEG Live. Lawyers for Michael Jackson's mother and three children don't know what they'll find in Frank DiLeo's e-mails, but they are hoping it will support their contention that DiLeo was beholden to the concert promoter and not to Jackson. Jackson changed managers twice in the last three months of his life. In late March 2009, he hired Leonard Rowe -- one of his father's friends -- to replace Tohme Tohme, the manager who initially negotiated the deal with AEG for his ""This Is It"" tour. Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live forced Jackson to take DiLeo, who had worked for him off and on for decades, as his manager in May 2009 because they did not want to work with Rowe. Their contention is part of their larger argument that AEG Live executives were liable for Jackson's death because they hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG counters that it was Jackson who chose and hired Murray, not them. AEG lawyers argue that Jackson was responsible for his own death and that drug addiction led to his bad decisions. Choreographer: AEG considered pulling plug on Jackson's comeback . The coroner ruled his death, which came near the end of preparations for a series of comeback concerts, was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol that Murray was using to treat Jackson's insomnia. AEG Live contends its executives had no way of knowing the doctor was using propofol in the privacy of Jackson's bedroom. The Jacksons are seeking billions of dollars in damages, equal to what Michael Jackson might have earned if he had not died on June 25, 2009. The Los Angeles trial began three weeks ago and is expected to continue into July. The lawsuit contends AEG Live ignored warning signs about Jackson's health in his last weeks, and instead of getting him help they pressured Jackson and Murray to have him at rehearsals. DiLeo would have been part of that pressure, they contend. ""Get him a bucket of chicken,"" DiLeo said on June 19, 2009, in reply to concerns about Jackson's weight loss, makeup artist Karen Faye testified last week. ""It was such a cold response, it broke my heart,"" Faye said through tears. The next day -- June 20, 2009 -- DiLeo left a voice mail on Murray's cell phone. ""I'm sure you're aware he had an episode last night. He's sick. Today's Saturday. Tomorrow, I'm on my way back. I'm not going to continue my trip. I think you need to get a blood test on him. We got to see what he's doing?"" Wade Robson calls Jackson 'a pedophile' DiLeo's e-mails were recovered after what the judge called ""a lot of red tape and kind of cloudiness,"" that included the AEG's lawyers also representing the estate of DiLeo, who died in 2011, in fighting the Jacksons' subpoena for them. ""Because (DiLeo's widow) didn't have litigation counsel, we're representing her for the limited purposes of responding to that subpoena,"" AEG's lead lawyer, Marvin Putnam, told the judge. Soon after an Ohio court ordered DiLeo's estate to give his laptop and e-mails to the Jackson lawyers, the AEG lawyers -- in their other capacity representing the DiLeo estate -- reported that they could not locate the computer or e-mails. Jackson lawyers, however, learned that the DiLeo estate's previous lawyer -- Pennsylvania lawyer David Regoli -- kept a copy of the e-mail files. For the past several weeks, however, the AEG lawyers argued he had no authority to provide them to the Jacksons' lawyers for use in the case against AEG. But in a phone call to the court this week, Regoli said he advised DiLeo's widow, Linda DiLeo, that ""in my opinion, it was a conflict"" for AEG's lawyers -- from the Los Angeles firm O'Melveny and Myers -- to represent her in the matter. Witness: 'Everybody was lying' after Jackson died . ""She said that she never signed anything with O'Melveny and Myers to authorize them to represent her, and as of this moment they are not representing her anymore,"" Regoli said. Linda DiLeo then rehired Regoli, which allows him to send the e-mails on to the Jacksons -- after removing any that are personal or not relevant to the case. ""I think I can give the court my assurances that I'll go through the documents that I have and I'll go through the e-mails, and anything that is related to the subpoena, I would obviously turn over,"" Regoli said. As for the missing laptop, there was a simple explanation. Linda DiLeo ""had told me her daughter had given it to a friend who needed a computer,"" Regoli said. ""It wasn't a very new computer."" While the Jackson lawyers wanted to explore how AEG's lawyers came to represent the DiLeo estate in Ohio, the judge declined exploring the matter. ""All we know right now they're not representing her, and that's enough for us,"" Judge Yvette Palazuelos said. The trial's fourth week starts Monday morning with AEG's chief counsel, Shawn Trell, on the witness stand. Jackson lawyers are expected to grill him about the contract negotiations with Michael Jackson and Murray. Witness: Jackson was paranoid, talking to himself in last days .","Frank DiLeo's laptop couldn't be found after Jackson's lawyers subpoenaed it .

"(CNN) -- Ashly Covington is the kind of top model who doesn't lift a finger. She doesn't cook, she doesn't clean and she avoids anything that could ruin her manicure. Kimbra Hickey's hands on the covers helped sell the novel ""Twilight."" But if your hands could earn $1,200 in a day, you'd think twice before scrubbing down the bathroom, too. As one of the few full-time body parts models, Covington thinks about her hands ""every minute of every hour of every day,"" because for the past seven years, her hands (and, occasionally, her legs and feet) have been her sole source of income. She can earn anywhere from $300 a day to a couple thousand per hour. ""Most people can walk away from work when they're done with a job, but parts models can't, because [our parts] have to be flawless. I moisturize 20 to 30 times a day, and wear gloves 90 percent of the time,"" she said. ""When it's your livelihood, you've got to think hands first."" Parts modeling was ushered into the public's conscious with the ""Seinfeld"" episode when George Costanza became a hand model, but the specialty is still the oddball of the fashion and advertising industry.  See other famous faces behind the hands » . With all of the reality TV showing what it takes to prance the runways, none depict the truth about being a parts model. There's the discomfort of contorting one's hand in an uncomfortable position for hours, or attempts to ""smile"" with one's feet. ""Some people have a very romanticized view of what [parts] modeling is,"" said Danielle Korwin, president of the New York City-based Parts Models modeling agency. ""Their boyfriend or grandmother or mother has said, 'you have great hands, you should be a model,' but we want only the exceptional. Your hands have to be veinless, poreless and flawless."" Covington believes hand modeling may be harder to break into than other kinds. Even if you have gorgeous hands, Covington said, that doesn't mean they photograph well. ""You have to know how to hold the hand so it looks beautiful."" Since runway models and actors aren't hand perfectionists like professional parts models, producers bring in body doubles for close-ups. As a result, parts models have to do what seems like the near impossible: ""Your hands have to convey emotion,"" Covington said, whose background in drama serves her well. ""I was doing a shoot where I had to pick up a cheeseburger and bring it to camera, but they wanted it to be the most delectable cheeseburger,"" Covington said. ""So I said 'mmmm,' and really conveyed the emotion entirely to get it reflected in my hands."" Hand model James Furino, who's played the hands of famous leading men like Matthew Perry on ""Friends"" and Daniel Craig for a ""James Bond"" promotion, and has also landed print advertisements for clients like Smirnoff Vodka, said those gigs can be a lot of pressure. ""They spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in pre-production and people are flying in all over the country so you can get to that exact moment where you split a muffin, and it's [on] you,"" he said. Newcomer Jivelle Callender agreed that parts modeling for TV spots can be ""nerve-wracking."" ""You're standing in the middle of a large group of people who are very close on top of you, and the attention is fully focused on your hands,"" she said. ""But your hands are not the star, the product is the star. Depending on what you're doing, some shoots are very involved -- dipping a shrimp, for example. It's one thing to just dip a shrimp, but it's quite another thing to do it on camera to make sure the shrimp looks spectacular."" You have to wonder where the glory is when a person's camera time is lessened in favor of a few crustaceans. ""I love sets; I love working with the camera crew and the director,"" Callender said, who also does print work for companies like Nordstrom as well. ""It's nice to see my hand in the commercial, but I don't care if people know that it's me or not."" Covington's hands have been everywhere from Hamilton Beach clothing iron boxes to NuvaRing birth control ads, and have even starred in that inescapable Dawn dish liquid commercial featuring a purple, Spanish-speaking sponge. ""I've had some of my mom's friends say, 'When will it be your face?' But I'm not trying for that. I'm really proud of all the places that my hands have been. I think it's neat that everyone in the world has seen my hands and nobody knows it,"" Covington said. Yet Kimbra Hickey proved the life of hand model can be moved out of the shadows when she became the cover art hand model for the novel ""Twilight"" five years ago. ""I just stumbled on it. I've never been recognized as a hand model, but when I started going to bookstores and telling people who were in line paying for 'Twilight' that those were my hands, before you know it, I had a line of people waiting for autographs."" Hickey is now touring with various ""Twilight"" themed conventions, autographing covers and recreating her now-famous hand pose for photos with fans. ""When you start to realize that you have this little bit of celebrity status, it's a strange feeling, because I've never had that before,"" Hickey said. ""I feel lucky just to be a part of it.""

"Oxford, Mississippi (CNN) -- The Mississippi man accused of making a potent toxin found in letters mailed to President Barack Obama and other officials will be held without bond pending a preliminary hearing later this week, a federal magistrate ruled Monday. Federal authorities arrested James Everett Dutschke, 41, on Saturday on charges of possessing and using ricin after initially charging -- and then clearing -- another man with whom Dutschke has sometimes feuded. Wearing an orange jumpsuit, and his hands and feet shackled as he entered the courtroom, Dutschke told Magistrate S. Allan Alexander that he understood what he had been charged with. His attorney, George Lucas, told Alexander that they had not yet had time to go through the complaint. Alexander agreed to order Dutschke held without bond on grounds he could be a danger to the community or could try to run. She set a preliminary hearing for Thursday. Both Lucas and Assistant U.S. Attorney Chad Lamar declined to comment. While the eight-minute proceeding produced no new details, the public could learn more about the accusations when the criminal affidavit in support of the complaint is unsealed. That is now expected to occur at the preliminary hearing, according to the Justice Department. Dutschke's arrest was the latest head-scratching twist in what could be a tale of small-town intrigue that blew up to become international news. The letters -- sent to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Sadie Holland, a local judge, arrived April 16 and touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the bombing of the Boston Marathon. The two incidents were unconnected, officials said. Before police settled on Dutschke as a suspect, they took into custody a Corinth, Mississippi, man named Paul Kevin Curtis, who makes his living impersonating Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis. Curtis vehemently denied sending the letters, said he was framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit. What is ricin? The ties that bind . Dutschke used to work for Curtis' brother at an insurance company, under the direction of Curtis' ex-wife. Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book but later had a falling out. He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the latter has denied. In an April 22 court hearing before the charges were dropped, Curtis said he was being framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit. Dutschke told reporters last week that he did not know Curtis well. ""He's just a little nutty,"" he said. ""I don't have a relationship with him."" The ties that bind II . So where do the lawmakers fit in? Dutschke can be linked to Sadie Holland through her son, Democratic state representative Steve Holland. Dutschke failed in a bid as a Republican to unseat the younger Holland. As for Curtis, Sadie Holland presided over a 2004 assault hearing involving Curtis, who says he has been in jail ""over 20 times,"" but never convicted. And Wicker? Dutschke said he once met Wicker. Suspect No. 1 . The letters read, in part: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" They were signed ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" a source told CNN. Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. The very next day, authorities arrested Curtis. His attorney, Christi McCoy, said he'd been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media. The FBI said the letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. The very next week, authorities dropped the charges against Curtis after they said they had new information. ""I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily,"" he told CNN last week after being cleared. Suspect No. 2 . The feds then turned their attention to Dutschke. Agents searched his residence and former martial arts studio. Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he agreed to the FBI search ""to help clear my name."" ""I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters,"" he said. Early Saturday, he was arrested without incident at home. He was charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon in connection with the letters. More trouble . This isn't his only brush with the law. Dutschke faces molestation charges in an unrelated case. According to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by CNN, Dutschke is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. He has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media and pleaded not guilty in court this month. Dutschke closed his tae kwon do studio after the allegations were made public. Dutschke was previously convicted on indecent exposure charges in another case and sentenced to 90 days in jail. A song in his heart . As for Curtis, he told CNN he's ""just glad it's over."" When he learned Dutschke had been arrested, he took a deep breath and felt like ""a weight had been taken off."" ""I just want to return to my kids and my music,"" Curtis said. During another interview with CNN last week, he said the public attention could ""thrust him into the limelight."" And then, at the urging of reporter Chris Cuomo, he burst into song. A rousing rendition of Randy Travis' ""On the Other Hand."" CNN's Vivian Kuo reported from Oxford, Mississippi; Rich Phillips and Alina Machado from Booneville, Mississippi. Ed Payne wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Dana Ford and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: More details of investigation expected to be unsealed this week .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Eleven people -- six in Baghdad and five in Kirkuk -- died in attacks in the two major Iraqi cities, police said Thursday. The incidents came amid an uptick of sectarian and political violence in the country. The bloodiest attack was in the northern city of Kirkuk, where a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest Thursday afternoon at the main entrance to a Shiite mosque. At least five people died in that blast, while 17 others were wounded, police said. In Baghdad, a car bomb explosion in Sadr City -- a volatile, Shiite neighborhood in the eastern part of the Iraqi capital -- left three people and and 17 more wounded, police told CNN. Another car bomb blew up Thursday near an outdoor market in Baghdad's Chukook neighborhood -- also a predominantly Shiite district. One bystander died and five people were wounded in that attack. Elsewhere in Baghdad, gunmen shot dead two people in the neighborhood of al-Bayaa. Two bombs exploded in the northern city of Mosul, police said Thursday. A car bomb wounded eight people and a roadside bomb wounded a Kurdish security officer at a joint Iraqi army-Kurdish checkpoint. Overall, violence has dropped significantly in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence, between 2005 and 2007. But tensions and violence, stirred in part by enmity between Shiites and Sunnis, have persisted since the U.S-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. On Wednesday, bombings in Kirkuk and Baghdad left at least 29 people dead and 120 wounded.","NEW: Suicide bombing in Kirkuk kills 5, wounds 17, police say .

"Reyhanli, Turkey (CNN) -- Protesters in a Turkish border town hit by a twin car-bombing a week ago clashed with police Saturday, as they voiced anger over the government's response to the attack. About 50 people were killed and about 100 injured when the blasts went off in the southern town of Reyhanli, in across the border from Syria's Idlib province, on May 11. One was at the community's city hall and the other in front of a post office. The protest Saturday began relatively peacefully but descended into chaos as running street clashes broke out with police. Protesters threw rocks and bottles at the police, who responded by firing tear gas canisters and high-pressure paintballs. Officers also brought out a water cannon. Women and children ran from the scene as thick clouds of tear gas spread through the streets at the heart of the confrontation. Police prevented the protesters from reaching the site of the blasts in the center of the town, which lies in Turkey's southern Hatay province. The police have not yet commented on the clashes, which quietened down after less than an hour. The protest -- which started with several thousand people but dwindled to a hard core of several hundred as trouble broke out -- was intended to show support and solidarity for the people of Reyhanli in the wake of the deadly bombings. Many people in the town are angry at the government's response and say its decision to take in Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict in their country has made Turkey a target for attacks. The crowd chanted calls for Erdogan and the government to resign. One family of demonstrators was mourning the death of Ayten Calim, a 20-year-old secretary from Reyhanli who was killed in the bombings last Saturday. Her brother, Halim Calim, said, ""We are here to voice our pain."" He and another brother carried Turkish flags and a banner with Ayten's photo on it that read, ""We will not forget."" Some have criticized Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for traveling to the United States this week instead of coming to Reyhanli to show support. Erdogan has held talks with U.S. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials in Washington. Turkish President Abdullah Gul visited Reyhanli Thursday, when he vowed that those responsible for the car bombs would be held accountable. Celalettin Lekesiz, governor of Hatay province, said Saturday that security forces had detained 17 people so far in connection with the bomb attacks and are hunting for four others, the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported. All 21 suspects are Turkish nationals, he said. Lekesiz said the security forces now had detailed information about how the suspects allegedly acquired the explosives and staged the bomb attacks, the news agency reported. Interior Minister Muammer Guler and other Turkish officials have accused a former Marxist terror group that they say maintains relations with Al Muhabarat, Syria's intelligence services, according to Anadolu. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report .","NEW: Provincial governor says security forces have detained 17 people over last week's attack .

"(CNN) -- ""A must-have quality for figure skaters is, I think, gorgeousness."" Japan's Daisuke Takahashi throws his head back and laughs, but he is serious. His is a sport where performance is everything -- from the flamboyant routines to the glitzy outfits to the interaction with the crowd. ""The best part about figure skating is how I can have the entire audience's attention to myself,"" the former world champion told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I believe performing and showing off is very important, but I constantly prevent myself from becoming too self-absorbed. The audience won't be moved if I'm performing only for my satisfaction. ""It's sort of like playing 'catch.' For me, when I'm watching musicals or performances, I feel a bit uncomfortable when the actor is too self-absorbed. I like the people who can perform while being sensitive of the atmosphere."" Takahashi was raised to national hero status in 2010 when he became the first Japanese man to win a world singles title in figure skating, having the previous month become the first to win an Olympic medal in the discipline when he took bronze in Vancouver. Despite his success -- he also won silver at last year's worlds -- the 27-year-old admits he still looks up to his rivals. ""I never thought I have anything special. I've always thought about what I don't have compared to other skaters,"" he says. ""I tend to think like other skaters get more applause than I do. I constantly think about ways I can level up, and I'm often jealous of other skaters,"" he adds, laughing. ""When I see someone's cool performance, it makes me want to be like them, and that's what motivates me."" A big part of figure skating is the outfits -- often elaborate lycra creations that might otherwise seem more at home in a musical stage show. ""I don't have long legs and arms, and I am ... short,"" quips Takahashi. ""So I want something that makes me look taller and with longer legs and arms. ""I want something will make me a bit bigger, and so something with flaps that give my arms a little flow."" The shoes, with their thin blades, are even more important. ""If I didn't have them, I wouldn't be able to skate, so it's like the heart,"" Takahashi says. ""I think it's something everyone struggles with, especially for me because my shoes don't last long. I sometimes change them every month or after every competition, and it's very difficult finding the right shoes. Depending on if the shoes are good, it affects the performance, so it's very important."" Born in the city of Kurashiki in Okayama Prefecture, Takahashi wanted to be a gymnast when he was growing up. But, as fate would have it, an ice rink was built near his home and his future was settled by the practical reality of it being closer than the gymnasium where he infrequently trained. ""My mother's co-worker who really liked ice skating took me and it made me realize that I really want to do this,"" he recalls. ""Figure skating wasn't famous where I grew up, and the ice rink was just built with a small club team without a professional coach, so the number of skaters was really small. But we all worked together to manage the money, learn tricks, and organize."" At junior high school he met Utako Nagamitsu, who has remained his coach ever since -- she is currently working alongside the Russian Nikolai Morozov, who is now back on Takahashi's team after their initial split back in 2008. ""We've traveled the world together, which other coaches rarely do,"" Takahashi says of Nagamitsu. ""Now it's officially a team, with a nutritionist, trainer, management company, costume maker, music mixer and level check managers, and choreographers."" Takahashi's success in 2010 was all the more satisfying because he had only just returned to full fitness after a serious knee injury that sidelined him for a year. The anterior cruciate ligament problem halted his progress after he won silver at the 2007 world championships -- another first for Japan. ""I'm afraid of injuries. The surgery was good for my mental health, but it was about three years later when I was able to get back my flow,"" he says. ""As for balancing off-ice and on-ice life, right now I try not to because all of it is part of my private lifestyle. I'll take breaks to rest my body, but I generally don't feel like I must take days off."" Takahashi took more time out in 2011 when he had to have the bolt from that knee surgery removed, but he recovered the following year to win his first Grand Prix Final -- which was held in Sochi, the Russian resort city that will host next year's Winter Olympics. ""The most significant competition for me is the Olympics. I've entered the Olympics twice, but the one at Vancouver is the one I can't forget about,"" Takahashi says. ""It was the season after recovering from my injury. It was a competition that I got so excited I started tearing up before it began, which never happened before. ""I got hurt, and I struggled, took out my feelings on the people who supported me, and even then I was able to make the Olympics, and through the season it was the only time when I felt like I was actually competing well. ""It wasn't the perfect performance, but it was my first medal, and I think that was when my life took a different turn."" Takahashi is now hoping to earn one of the three men's places in Japan's figure skating team for Sochi. He finished sixth at March's world championships in Canada, behind fourth-placed compatriot Yuzuru Hanyu but ahead of Takahito Mura in eighth. Both are much younger -- Hanyu is 18 and Mura 22 -- and Takahashi is keenly aware that he has a lot of work to do if he is to succeed at Sochi. ""They definitely are rivals, but it's more like I try hard so that they see me as their rival. Now the level of technicality of skating is very high and they grew up with the new rules, but my generation just adjusted to the new rules ... It's hard keeping up."" But Takahashi showed last month in Tokyo that he still has what it takes, winning the individual title for the second year in a row at the World Team Trophy event, with Mura fifth. ""Since three years ago when I decided to continue my career until Sochi, I think emotionally I'm doing everything I can to prepare for it, more than any other Olympics ever,"" he says. ""I don't have the Olympics gold medal, so I definitely want it.""","Daisuke Takahashi is the first Japanese man to win an Olympic medal in figure skating .

"(CNN) -- Photographer Arne Svenson's show, ""Neighbors,"" consists of photographs taken of the residents of a building near his studio in New York through the windows of their apartments. A few residents, unaware they were being photographed, have raised objections. In this column, Svenson explains his process and his work. My art practice has led me down many and varied paths of visual exploration -- from landscape photographs of Las Vegas to portraits of sock monkeys, chewed dog toys and medical museum specimens. Currently, in collaboration with the Andy Warhol Museum, I am working on a long-term portrait project with a group of autistic teenagers. Given my background as a special education teacher, I find this a particularly rewarding homecoming. First and foremost, my practice seeks out the inner life -- the essence -- of my subjects, whether they be human or inanimate. I use my camera as a writer uses text, to create a narrative that helps the viewer understand what might lie hidden or obscured. This narrative, at times only a whisper or suggestion, weaves throughout my bodies of work. Some time ago, I began photographing the occupants of a neighboring building through the windows. I've lived in Tribeca, in Lower Manhattan, for 30 years, and have built my life and studio here. The area has gone through many changes, and I watched the building across the way built from the ground up. Made entirely of glass and steel, it offers residents views of the neighborhood -- and neighbors and passersby views into the apartments. As people filled the empty units, I was intrigued not only by the implied stories within the frame of the glass but also by the play of light upon the subjects, the shadows, the framing of the structure. I don't photograph anything salacious or demeaning -- instead I record the turn of the head, the graceful arc of a hand, the human form obscured by drapery. The photographs make up a show called ""Neighbors,"" which opened a week ago at the Julie Saul Gallery in New York, and some people have raised concerns. I am not photographing the residents as specific, identifiable individuals, but as representations of humankind. In fact, I take great care in not revealing their identity; the strength of the imagery comes from us seeing ourselves in the anonymous figures of ""The Neighbors."" In New York, people are masters of being both the observer and the observed. We live so densely packed that contact is inevitable -- even our homes are stacked facing each other. It is no wonder that street photography was born in this city, and some of the best subjects and most famous works are the results of those who didn't know they were being photographed or painted. ""Neighbors"" has sparked a good bit of conversation. While people differ in their opinions -- as most do when it comes to art -- I believe the images speak for themselves. I encourage everyone to draw their own conclusions after seeing the work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arne Svenson.","Fine art photographer Arne Svenson's artworks encompass many subjects .

"(CNN) -- Writer-director Joe Carnahan wisely gets back to basics in ""The Grey"" after the over the top CGI heroics of ""The A-Team."" In their last collaboration, Liam Neeson fell out of the clouds in a tank and lived to tell the tale. This time he's stranded in the arctic wastes of Alaska when the plane transporting a crew of rugged oil drillers crashes in the back of beyond. The half dozen survivors are in bad shape, with few supplies, no chance of contacting the outside world and little hope of rescue. They have sub-zero temperatures to contend with, howling winds and snow, and the only source of meat on the horizon -- a pack of timber wolves -- has its own ideas about the pecking order on the food chain. Neeson quickly emerges as the leader of the men. He's a head taller than anybody else and maybe a head smarter, too. He also knows wolves, so he says -- though it's hard to believe anyone on this movie could claim as much. Any animal expert could tell you that timber wolves are more likely to run in the opposite direction than give chase to humans. Compared to a grizzly bear, your typical North American grey is a pussycat. That's not the kind of animal Neeson and company bump into. These puppies are of the big, bad variety: vicious, lethal and relentless. Neeson -- perhaps rashly -- decides to abandon the wrecked plane and strike out south, into the woods. He's followed by a rapidly depleting line of the walking wounded, and a posse of salivating lupus. This is bare bones storytelling in more ways than one, though Carnahan can't resist injecting stray purple pronouncements of existential angst (I kept hoping that one of the guys would get hold of the letter Neeson has stashed in his pocket, the one where he tells the girl who got away he's exiled himself to live with the dregs of humanity, ""Ex cons, misfits, a*******... men unfit for mankind""). Fortunately he's a better filmmaker than he is a screenwriter. Impressively shot in northern British Columbia by the talented Masanobu Takayanagi, the movie feels grounded and real even when the dialogue (and the angry wolf pack) rings false. Interspersing exciting action sequences with tense slogs through hostile terrain, the movie has the structure of a classic western, with wolves standing in for outlaws or Indians. It's old hat, but it still plays. Neeson's in his element as the raw alpha male who reluctantly takes the others in hand. They include an angry, macho Latino (Frank Grillo), a boring nice guy (Dermot Mulroney) and an ailing black guy (Nonso Anozie) who might as well have ""Kibble"" tattooed to his forehead. Even though Carnahan never digs up anything very surprising about these stock characters, the terse, shape-shifting group dynamics are enough to keep us watching. The film's single best sequence comes early on. The plane crash -- and the nicely pitched run-up to it, as the passengers (all men) stow their bravado and start to grapple with what they might be facing -- is a knockout. Five minutes of pure white-knuckle drama. Even though nothing later comes close to it for enterprise or excitement, ""The Grey"" remains a genuinely gripping survival story and a refreshing change from stale urban action flicks: ""Jaws"" on paws.","""The Grey"" is impressively shot in northern British Columbia .

"(CNN) -- It's the issue within U.S. sport which simply refuses go away -- concussion and the potential danger it poses to professional athletes playing contact sports. Earlier this year the National Football League (NFL) reached a settlement with thousands of former football players to pay $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for the retired players and their families, and litigation expenses. Now the National Hockey League is facing a class-action lawsuit brought by 10 former NHL players. The lawsuit says the league hasn't done enough to protect players from concussions in a sport where physical contact is common and often spills over into heated argument. The players' legal action drew a swift response from the NHL. ""While the subject matter is very serious, we are completely satisfied with the responsible manner in which the League and the Players' Association have managed player safety over time, including with respect to head injuries and concussions,"" said the NHL statement. ""We intend to defend the case vigorously and have no further comment at this time."" Former NHL All-Star Gary Leema is one of the 10 players to have taken the action against the league and its board of governors. Opinion: NFL settlement raises questions . ""Unbeknownst to plaintiffs, scientific evidence has linked brain injuries to long-term neurological problems for decades,"" read the lawsuit, filed in a Washington D.C. court. ""While every blow to the head is dangerous, plaintiffs did not know, and were not told by the NHL, how dangerous this repeated brain trauma is. ""The NHL has known or should have known of this growing body of scientific evidence and its compelling conclusion that hockey players who sustain repetitive concussive events, sub-concussive events and/or brain injuries are at significantly greater risk of neuro-cognitive illness and disabilities both during their hockey careers and later in life."" The players claim a series of updates to the rules made in 2004, while creating a more exciting, marketable game, increased the number of violent in-game collisions. ""Hopefully this lawsuit will shine a light on the problem and the players can get the help they deserve,"" Rick Vaive, a former Toronto Maple Leafs player and one of 10 players who have launched the lawsuit, said in a statement. The lawsuit also accuses the NHL of waiting until 2010 to prohibit targeting a player's head during a challenge, while also failing to outlaw body-checking. ""We have, on our own, a long history, going back to 1997, of taking concussions very seriously,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said earlier this year. ""We spend a lot of time, money and effort working with the players' association on player safety."" The NFL agreement, which involves more than 4,500 plaintiffs, still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case. Meanwhile it was announced Tuesday that Rogers Communications has paid a record-breaking $5.2 billion for the rights to broadcast the NHL in Canada. The deal, which also includes multimedia rights, will last 12 years and is the largest in NHL history.

"Washington (CNN) -- Your little post office might be on a proposed list of closings coming out Tuesday as the U.S. Postal Service tries to find ways to cut red ink. Some would be replaced by a ""Village Post Office"" located within a commercial retail store. Postmaster General Patrick Donohoe planned a news conference Tuesday to release a long-awaited ""post office study list"" of potential closings nationwide, typically targeting rural post offices where only a few hundred customers are served. The facilities targeted, potentially numbering in the thousands, will be subject to a review and appeals process before any final decision is made. The list was developed based on low workload among post office employees, a small number of customers, and whether that location could be combined with other postal facilities nearby. The list to be released Tuesday has 3,653 facilities named, according to materials CNN obtained. They are categorized as follows: . GROUP 1: Less than $27,500 in annual revenue; less than 2 hours of workload daily (3,061) GROUP 2: Less than $600,000 in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 2 miles (385) GROUP 3: Less than $1 million in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 0.5 miles (188) GROUP 4: Offices currently suspended (19) Donohoe is also expected to provide details of a plan to increase joint marketing with other retailers as a way to improve customer access to postal services. A presentation obtained by CNN includes a drawing of a small grocery storefront, combined with signage suggesting the building is also a ""Village Post Office,"" complete with signs featuring the stylized logo of the postal service. In May, Donohoe told CNN, ""You've got a post office, a gas station, and a store; they're in a small town, the gas station and the store are struggling, we think we can provide service through contracts in many cases,"" that could cut operating costs for the Postal Service. Post office closings have upset some community leaders who say it could hurt their town's identity and make it difficult for the elderly to collect their mail and send letters. Some post offices, such as Laneview, Virginia, have already been notified they were under review and have held meetings to prepare to challenge any decision to close. ""This post office is small,"" said Laneview manager Cynthia Reed-Fisher, ""and from me working here the past two years, I was pretty sure that this post office would be on the list."" Dozens attended a meeting at a church to tell the Postal Service why their location should be spared. Donohoe and other postal officials have told CNN the downsizing will try to preserve local town identities by maintaining their names and zip codes, and continuing to deliver that mail through other nearby facilities.","The U.S. Postal Service considers closing low-use post offices .

"(CNN) -- The Tibetan protester who set himself alight in the Indian capital ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit this week has died. The 27-year-old man was admitted to hospital in New Delhi Monday with 90% burns to his body, but doctors could not save him and he died on Wednesday, said L.K. Makhija, the head of the burns ward at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. Dramatic pictures showed the man, named by the London-based Free Tibet group as Jampa Yeshi, running along the street in flames as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Indian parliament to protest against Chinese rule in Tibet. Many ethnic Tibetans fled Tibet for India with the Dalai Lama in 1959 after a failed uprising. President Hu was due to arrive in India for Thursday's BRICS summit of emerging economic powers, which includes India, China, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Self-immolation is a common form of protest for Tibetans who want genuine autonomy from China and accuse Beijing of repression. Reports: Tibetans take their lives in protest of Chinese rule . More than 30 of them took place in the last year in China, Tibetan advocacy groups say. They follow an increase in security measures by the Chinese authorities in response to unrest among Tibetans in western areas of China in recent months. Some in Tibet have advocated independence from China. But the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the most numerous ethnic group in China. Activists say the disturbing acts of self-immolation reflect an increasingly repressive environment under China's control. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. Chinese officials have described the self-immolations as ""extreme"" acts. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","27-year-old man was admitted to hospital in New Delhi with 90% burns to his body .

"(CNN) -- Federal aid helped many cash-strapped Americans keep a roof over their heads during the prolonged economic slump, but the number of people living a step away from the streets has grown sharply, researchers reported Wednesday. The estimated U.S. homeless population dipped about 1% between 2009 and 2011 despite the lingering effects of the 2007-2009 recession, the Washington-based Homelessness Research Institute concluded. About $1.5 billion from the 2009 economic stimulus measure went toward rental assistance and programs steering recently evicted people toward new housing, ""and it seems likely that that has worked,"" said Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Nevertheless, the homeless population went up in 24 states during the past two years, the Washington-based researchers found. And the number of people who have had to move in with friends or relatives -- often a last stop before the street -- is up as well, according to Wednesday's report. The Homelessness Research Institute, the educational arm of Roman's organization, put the number of Americans living on the streets or in shelters at just over 636,000 in 2011. That's down about 6,000 from the group's 2009 estimate. The figure is based on reports and street counts from state and local agencies that receive federal housing funds. Roman said the stimulus money, coupled with pre-recession federal programs aimed at veterans and the chronically ill, have kept that figure down even as the U.S. economy saw its worst downturn since the 1930s. But that money is drying up now that the Obama administration, Congress and the states are grappling with budget issues fueled by the recession. ""Just like all domestic discretionary spending, it's vulnerable at the moment because of the deficit,"" Roman said. States have already been cutting services, ""So again, it's notable that these are still working."" The report found the effects of the recession keep cascading downward more than two years after its official end in mid-2009. More than 4 million homes have been lost to foreclosure since 2007, according to the online marketer RealtyTrac. Those foreclosures have driven many ex-homeowners into the rental market, driving up rents and pushing some of the working poor to move in with family, friends or other acquaintances. That ""doubled-up"" population grew by about 800,000 people between 2009 and 2010, the last year data was available, the HRI report concluded. About 6.8 million were in combined households in 2010, a more than 50% increase from 2005, researchers found. ""The most common previous address for homeless people is that they were doubled up with someone else,"" Roman said. The new figures are ""not a good sign. It means we've got potentially a lot of people moving toward homelessness."" The number of low-income households that spend more than half their income on rent grew by 300,000 in 2009, to 6.2 million. That's about three-quarters of poor renters, the HRI study found. But the figures showed slight declines among nearly all categories examined, including a more than 10% decline in the number of unemployed veterans and about a 3% dip in the ranks of the chronically homeless -- people with disabilities like severe mental illness or addiction that result in repeated or extended stays on the street.","The estimated U.S. homeless population has remained basically flat, researchers say .

"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy brought an assault of historic proportions to millions of homeowners in the Northeast this week. Damages are estimated at between $30 billion and $50 billion. As the recovery process begins, residents of the hardest-hit areas should follow the advice of local and state authorities and Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives. As you return to your homes, here are some structural issues to look for and how to address them. If your home suffered slight to moderate damage -- basement flooding, broken windows, missing roof shingles â€” the storm cleanup may be a little easier but no less urgent. A compromised roof makes your house vulnerable to more serious issues, while anything flooded becomes a potential breeding ground for mold, mildew or rot if not addressed quickly. Downed power lines are perhaps the biggest risk after a storm of this size. Avoid wading into standing water or going anywhere near ground wires. Just because you have no power in your house doesn't mean there isn't a live current. Before you do anything, take pictures of any damage, however minor, in case you need them for insurance purposes. 7 health risks after Sandy . Flooded basements . If basement flooding has left 2 or 3 feet of standing water, your first impulse will be to pump the water out quickly. But if you had that much water, the ground around the house may still be fully saturated, increasing the pressure on your home's walls and foundation. This is especially dangerous in old houses with loose stone foundations as opposed to poured concrete. Pump the water out slowly, a foot a day to be on the safe side. Anything that is water-soaked is already damaged, so a day or two is not going to matter. For those with moderate flooding, let your sump pump do its job; pick up additional units if necessary. A wet vac will also offer a handy assist. Once the water has been extracted, remove everything that you can: water-soaked boxes, furniture and especially carpeting. Open vents and windows and set up fans to promote air circulation through the space. The sooner everything dries out, the lower the potential for mold, mildew and permanent damage. Invest in a dehumidifier to fight dampness and facilitate the drying process. Floodwater can be filled with any number of contaminants, from sewage and sludge to chemicals, gas and motor oils, so be sure to wear gloves and a mask when you start cleaning walls and floors. You can purchase a disinfectant or create your own solution of Â¾ to 1 cup bleach per gallon of water. Use a mop and broom to clear out any mud or debris and be sure to remove any obstructions to drains. If you had drywall in the basement or any room of the house that experienced flooding, it will need to be removed and replaced (same goes for any water-saturated insulation). The chances of it drying out thoroughly are slim, and its potential to foster mold and mildew growth is considerable. Roof damage . With high winds comes the potential for serious roof damage. The roof is your home's greatest defense against the elements, so even minor damage can create serious problems. Inspect your roof for damaged or missing shingles. They will need to be replaced as soon as possible because the exposed roof deck will be subject to further dampness and moisture, which you don't want as winter approaches. If you had more serious roof damage, consult with a roofing contractor to see how you can protect the interior of your home until a professional repair can be made. Blue tarps offer a temporary solution and may be available through government agencies. Roof issues can also be evident from inside the house. Check the ceilings for water spots, particularly in rooms upstairs and near chimneys. The presence of water spots suggests that there may be additional roof problems. Trees and yard cleanup . Major tree damage? The municipality, power company, or emergency services in the area may help clear the way. If you are able to remove fallen branches safely, you should. Leave anything more to a qualified tree removal specialist. He or she will help you determine whether a damaged tree that's still standing can be saved. If you have shrubs and hedges, they no doubt took a beating, which means pruning may be in order. Most plants are resilient and will be no worse for wear come summer. Clear up any debris that might have collected in the yard, disposing of refuse in accordance with local regulations. It's going to take a good long while for everything to dry out. But, when the time comes, it will make good sense to power wash the exterior of the house. One of the most heartening things to come out of any disaster is the support and help of volunteers, neighbors and community organizations. If you weren't personally affected by the storm, think about volunteering to help those in need, particularly the elderly, or support relief organizations such as the American Red Cross.

"(CNN) -- Syria's main opposition group cast doubt on a Pakistani Taliban commander's claim that his fighters are establishing a presence in Syria to battle President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The Syrian National Coalition questioned news reports, including on CNN, saying the Taliban has opened an office in Syria. The group notes that a member of Taliban's Shura Council denied the development, calling it a ""rumor."" Lucy Liu: Syria's children deserve chance to be kids again . ""We ask for clarification regarding coverage that reflects poorly on the Syrian revolution, particularly news about Taliban's office in Syria and other news items about Islamist fighters,"" the coalition said in a statement released Thursday. Pakistani Taliban commander Abdul Rashid Abbasi told CNN that the first batch of fighters has arrived in Syria and established a command-and-control center to launch operational activities alongside Syrian rebel fighters. But Ahmed Kamel of the Syrian National Council, an entity that's part of the opposition coalition, called the reporting part of a ""systematic"" and ""rapid"" campaign by pro-regime forces to smear the rebels. He called them ""sick attempts to make the Syrian people look like a bunch of radical Islamists."" ""Syria is bigger than all of these lies and we know, based on our contacts inside Syria, that no Pakistani Taliban are fighting alongside the Syrian rebels,"" Kamel said. ""The Taliban want to kill Americans and Israelis, so why they should go to Syria when we are fighting for freedom, democracy and justice against a tyrant?"" Read more: Syria is a '10-year issue,' top general says . Lone wolves or part of a splinter group? The Pakistani Taliban is composed of extremists from around the world. Abbasi, a close associate of Pakistani Taliban leader Hakeemullah Mehsud, told CNN that 120 fighters are already in Syria and another batch of 150 fighters will arrive this week. ""We shall be sending more volunteers, but cannot give exact numbers at this moment. But we will provide whatever support is needed by our Syrian brothers,"" Abbasi told CNN. The fighters, Abbasi said, were sent after the Pakistani Taliban received a request from a top-ranking militant. They will be under the command-and-control structure of al Qaeda in Syria, as it is leading the operation, he said. But another Taliban commander, who does not want to be named, told CNN he has not had any instructions to ask his fighters to join rebel fighters in Syria. Nevertheless, he said, fighters have been leaving Pakistan to go to Syria. It's not clear whether foreign fighters who traveled to the tribal areas are now moving on from Pakistan as individuals or if a splinter group of the Taliban has decided to join the battle in Syria. The commander told CNN the issue of Syria has been discussed in the group's central executive committee, and commanders have remarked that fighters may be going to Syria but they are doing so as individuals. The group's committee members also discussed how Arab fighters who had come to Pakistan to join the Taliban's jihad have been leaving for other countries since the Arab Spring began. The commander said the Pakistani Taliban remains focused on its battle against the Pakistani state, and a core group of local militants remains in Pakistan. Foreign fighters in Syria . This Pakistani Taliban claim comes as the Syrian civil war has become a Sunni-Shiite proxy battle of sorts. CNN is unable to independently confirm that members of the Pakistani Taliban are inside Syria. CNN journalists previously inside Syria have seen foreign fighters participate in the country's civil war, which sprang from unrest sparked in the spring of 2011. Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group, has backed the Alawite-dominated government. Alawites are offshoots of Shiites. Sunni Islamist militants, including those who support al Qaeda, are among those who have backed the Sunni-dominated rebel movement. The Pakistani Taliban, which has long been conducting an insurgency against the Pakistani government, has claimed responsibility for a 2009 suicide strike targeting a CIA facility in Afghanistan and for the Times Square bombing attempt in 2010. The United States has targeted the Pakistani Taliban in that country's tribal region, along the Afghan border. Abbasi told CNN the group asked its local chapters in the Mohmand, Bajaur, Khyber, Orakzai and Waziristan agencies to recruit fresh fighters who are willing to participate in their mission in Syria. The Pakistani Taliban says many young men are registering to go on their first foreign mission. ""We have lots of fighters here and our central command will be operating from here, so there is no reason to stop operations in Pakistan,"" Abbasi said. ""They will go on as usual."" The Syrian National Coalition, in a letter to English-language media operations, said it is confident that the outlets ""strive to convey the news as it is delivered to you from different sources."" ""Reiterating its commitment to objectively deliver the truth to all media, the Syrian National Coalition media office stresses the need for media outlets to comply with professional rules and to seek more accuracy while reporting Syria's local and international news,"" the group said.","NEW: Are they individuals or part of a splinter group?

"(CNN) -- Look out for Asteroid 2012 DA14. It is heading toward Earth at 17,450 miles per hour, according to NASA, and the tug of our planet's gravitational field will cause it to accelerate when it gets here. But it's not going to strike us, when it passes by on February 15. NASA is adamant about this. ""Its orbit is very well-known,"" said Dr. Don Yeomans, NASA specialist for near-Earth objects. ""We know exactly where it's going to go, and it cannot hit the Earth."" But it will give the Blue Planet the closest shave by any object its size in known history, Yeomans said. Gravity will cause it to fly a curved path, tugging it closer to Earth's surface than most GPS or television satellites. While the asteroid is moving at a good clip, space rockets have to accelerate to an even higher speed to escape Earth's gravity and make it into space. Though 2012 DA14 will be flying more slowly, its trajectory will keep it from falling to Earth. Getting a look at 2012 DA14 . Star gazers in Eastern Europe, Asia or Australia might be able to see it with binoculars or consumer telescopes. It will not be visible to the naked eye, because it's small, ""about half the size of a football field,"" Yeomans said. There are millions of asteroids in our solar system, and they come in all dimensions -- from the size of a beach ball to a large mountain, NASA said. Researchers are looking forward to getting such a close look at an asteroid, as it flies from south to north past Earth, coming as close as 17,200 miles to our planet's surface. NASA will ping it with a signal from a satellite dish for a few days to get a better idea of its makeup. Astronomers think there are about half a million asteroids the size this one near Earth, NASA said, but less than one percent have been detected. Twenty years ago, no one would likely have discovered 2012 DA14, Yeomans said. Scientists spotted it nearly a year ago from an observatory in the south of Spain. Today, specialists track asteroids' paths 100 years into future. They do so less to assess any possible threat of impact with Earth and more to explore what opportunities they offer. ""These objects are important for science. They're important for our future resources,"" Yeomans said. Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet . Asteroids are potential gold mines . Asteroids can be chock full of metals and other materials, which could be mined for use on earth or on space stations. NASA has discussed the possibility of capturing near-Earth asteroids and placing them into Earth's orbit to study them and extract their resources. At least two start-up companies, Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, plan to mine asteroids and sell the acquired bounty on Earth and in space. Being able to exploit asteroids' resources would allow humans to fly farther out into the solar system, build stations a long way from Earth and supply them with materials gathered out in space. Some asteroids, for example, are made of ice, NASA said, which could be used as drinking water for a distant space platform. What if one like this did hit us? An asteroid this size passes this close to Earth only every 40 years and collides with it only once every 1,200 years. If NASA turns out to be wrong about this one not hitting the planet -- and they won't be -- then Asteroid 2012 DA14 would not destroy the world in any case, Yeomans said. An asteroid made of metal that was about the same size collided with Earth 50,000 years ago, creating the mile wide ""Meteor Crater"" in Arizona and obliterating everything for 50 miles around, he said. 2012 DA14 is likely made of stone, which would do much less damage. In 1908 a similar type asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded over Tunguska, Russia, leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two thirds the size of Rhode Island. Not Earth shattering, but you still wouldn't want to live nearby. More space and science news on CNN's Light Years blog .","It's going to be the closest shave in known history, NASA expert says .

"(CNN) -- Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's stunning decision to sign a right-to-work law poses the question: Are these anti-union statutes, which make illegal any union contract that requires union membership or payment of dues a condition of employment, the future? During the last two years Indiana and Wisconsin have also passed laws that curb union strength and slash dues income. ""If Michigan can do it, then I think everybody ought to think about it,"" asserts Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation. Mix listed Alaska, Missouri, Montana and Pennsylvania, where Republicans enjoy large majorities in state legislatures, among the top contenders. The potential spread of right-to-work laws in the North, even in states where voters heavily favored President Obama for a second term, is a startling and ominous development. For decades, right-to-work laws were confined to the South or Mountain West, heavily agricultural states where new unions born during the Depression era evoked, among many employers and conservative politicians, the specter of Communism, race-mixing or both. These laws were almost all enacted in the years after the 1947 Congressional passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, which gave states the right to make illegal any collective bargaining contract that mandated union membership as a condition of employment. Opponents of unionism hailed these laws as insuring a ""right-to-work"" because they encouraged workers to take a job, even one where the wages and working conditions had been negotiated by a union, without paying the dues necessary to sustain the labor organization. To note that employers encouraged such free-loading would be an understatement. Then and now they denounced ""compulsory unionism"" and the ""labor bosses"" who sought to live high on the hog on member dues. In this imagining, it was the union, not the employer, who oppressed the workers. Opinion: A victory for right-to-work laws . In 1958, right-to-work advocates thought the time was ripe to invade the North. A sharp recession in the late 1950s had sapped union strength at the same moment that the Senate's McClellan Labor Rackets Committee investigation had uncovered unsavory links between Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamsters, and organized crime. Urged on by conservative Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater and financed by a newly created National Right to Work Committee, these anti-union activists put right to work referenda on the ballots of California, Ohio, Washington, Kansas, Idaho and Colorado. But with the exception of Kansas, all these initiatives went down in overwhelming defeat. That was not only because labor was still a powerful force -- in Ohio union density, the proportion of all workers in a union, stood at nearly 40% -- but also because the Democrats linked their fortunes to the labor movement and to the fight against right to work. As Pat Brown, the California gubernatorial candidate put it, right to work represented ""a return to the ugly and destructive law of the economic jungle."" The battle for the votes of African-Americans constituted one of the most remarkable features of these referenda. Right-to-work advocates pointed out, often quite accurately, that many American trade unions failed to adequately represent their minority members. If unions were weaker, minority workers might well get better jobs and promotions. But in Ohio and California especially that argument failed to persuade. The NAACP distributed a pamphlet entitled ""Keep Mississippi Out of California,"" but even without this kind of propaganda most African-Americans and Latinos knew that an imperfect union was a better friend that a non-union employer whose power and prejudices ruled the workplace unchecked by any countervailing institution. Today, right-to-work forces are once again making a push to eviscerate unionism in its heartland. Thanks to Citizens United they have unlimited money. Thanks to globalization, slow growth, and corporate attacks, trade unionism is far weaker than in 1958. In Ohio union density stands at 13.4%, in Pennsylvania 14.6%, in Michigan, birth state of the once powerful United Automobile Workers, just 17.5%, a disastrous drop since the industrial union heyday in the 1950s. To staunch this anti-union assault, the Democrats have to make the defense of union rights and power a central, organic component of their message to American voters, office holders and workers -- both white collar and blue. Although Democratic legislators in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio have bravely fought the Republican right on this issue, President Obama has been notably missing from the action. Obama denounced ""right to work for less"" in a post-election speech at a factory outside Detroit, but he was almost entirely silent on the issue both during the demonstrations that convulsed Madison, Wisconsin, in the winter of 2011, during the effort to recall Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in the spring of the next year, and throughout the presidential campaign itself. Obama and his advisers undoubtedly thought that if they wanted to win right-to-work states like Virginia and Florida, they better keep quite about union rights in the North. But this was and is an exceedingly shortsighted and self defeating calculation. Trade unions stand at the core of the Democratic coalition. They are the last organizations remaining on the liberal side that can effectively appeal to white, working-class men in the Rust Belt swing states. Without the union organization and mobilization of blue collar Latinos in California, Nevada, and New Mexico those states would be almost as red as Texas. When Obama declared his support for gay marriage, he helped consolidate a growing national consensus in favor of that right. The president and other national Democrats need to use the same bully pulpit to defend trade unionism in its hour of need, not only because their destruction threatens the living standards of our working middle class, but because these institutions are the living embodiment of democracy, interracial solidarity and personal dignity in the world of work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nelson Lichtenstein.","Nelson Lichtenstein: Will more states pass right-to-work laws like Michigan?

He says opponents try to paint the union, not the employer, as oppressors of workers .

"(CNN) -- For years, stories about the North Pond Hermit circulated around central Maine. According to lore, the shadowy figure would sneak into cabins, camps and houses surrounding North Pond, and steal food, clothing, camping gear and other supplies. But he never took money and never caused damage, according to a 2005 story on the hermit in the Kennebec Journal newspaper. Locals, the newspaper reported, said they found odd caches of goods in the woods. Some speculated the hermit slipped out on wet or dark nights, gliding across the 273-acre pond in a boat to burglarize camps, the newspaper reported. Now state game warden Sgt. Terry Hughes says he caught 47-year-old Christopher Knight last week as he burglarized a camp for disabled people, at once confirming local folklore and ending a longtime nuisance for lakeside residents and property owners. Knight could be responsible for as many as a thousand burglaries, authorities say. ""It's been a myth, this character, this folklore person who is known as the hermit, who we've all known about, this unknown suspect who moves around in society and burglarizes camps,"" Hughes said at a news conference Wednesday. ""It's surreal, he's surreal, the situation is surreal,"" said Maine State Trooper Diane Perkins-Vance at the news conference. Knight had apparently lived in the woods for 27 years, speaking to another person just once in all that time, according to CNN affiliate WCSH. That person was a hiker he came across on a trail in the 1990s. Investigators say he kept his mind sharp with the books he stole during break-ins, the station reported. Pine Tree Camp was a favorite target, staffers told WCSH. At first, employees thought camping gear that was missing back in the 1980s and 1990s had just been misplaced. After the thefts continued -- including hundreds of dollars worth of food at a time -- camp officials decided a burglar was at work. The burglar would jimmy the locks on sliding glass doors and ""take anything he could find,"" including sliced meat, Parmesan cheese, coffee and camping equipment, Harvey Chesley, the facilities manager of the nearby camp, told WCSH. The camp put security cameras in its kitchen last year, capturing a clear picture of the burglar inside. But nobody recognized him, the Portland television station reported. Authorities captured Knight only after Hughes put up detectors that set off an alarm at his home if anyone broke into the camp, according to WCSH. Knight, who went to high school with Chesley, apologized for the break-ins, Chesley told the station. ""I do believe him,"" Chesley said. Knight is being held on a $5,000 cash bond at the Kennebec County Jail. As is custom in Augusta, he had a video arraignment Friday for his first court appearance. His next court date is yet to be determined. CNN's Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Locals told stories of a hermit who stole food and camping gear from lakeside properties .

"(CNN) -- Federal investigators ruled out foul play in a commuter train derailment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that left more than 70 people injured and shut down service along the busy New York-to-New Haven corridor, officials said Saturday. National Transportation Safety Board investigators are now focusing on a broken rail as a possible cause behind Friday's rush-hour collision of two trains. ""It is of substantial interest to us, and we will be sending a portion of that track back to the laboratory in Washington, D.C., for analysis,"" Earl Weener of the NTSB told reporters Saturday. Weener said the fracture could have been caused by the accident itself, or it could have been broken before the trains collided. Investigators will also look at the trains' braking performance, wheel and track conditions, and speed and other information from data recorders, he said. In addition to the trains, investigators also are examining the behavior and actions of the crew. The wreckage won't be removed until investigators finish examining it on site -- possibly Sunday, Weener said -- and then two tracks will have to be repaired before they can be reopened. While that happens, a long stretch of rail that tens of thousands of passengers take daily will be shut down. That includes Metro-North service for a 30-mile stretch between New Haven and South Norwalk, Connecticut, and Amtrak service between New York and New Haven -- both closed indefinitely. ""I think this is going to be with us for a number of days,"" Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy told reporters Saturday morning. 'Absolutely staggering damage' The damage to the tracks and several train cars is ""absolutely staggering,"" said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, who visited the site with other officials Saturday. Wreckage littered an area of about 200 yards, officials said. ""Ribbons of the sides of cars are torn away like ribbons of cloth,"" Blumnethal said. ""Tons of metal tossed around like toy things. The insides of cars are shattered."" The two Metro-North passenger trains, heading in opposite directions, collided Friday evening in southwestern Connecticut, damaging both trains and leaving some people critically injured. The accident occurred when a train heading from New York City to New Haven derailed around 6:10 p.m. That train struck the other train in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Weener said Saturday. Three people still were in critical condition Saturday morning, according to Andrew Doba, spokesman for Malloy. The governor had said Friday night that five people were seriously injured. Of the 70 people taken to hospitals Friday, nine remained in the facilities Saturday morning, hospital representatives told CNN. 'Doctors up front' A passenger in a middle car of the New York-bound train, Chris Martin, said his car went dark after the crash. He then heard someone yell over the intercom for ""all the doctors up front."" Martin said his crowded train was evacuated. Everybody on his train was physically fine, he said, but many were shaken emotionally. He said he saw injured people outside the train. Brian Alvarez said he saw the wreckage. ""I saw this one car and it was completely destroyed, and they were pulling people out of the car,"" Alvarez said. ""... They were all bloody."" Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch said Friday that travel headaches could persist for weeks because the two tracks affected by the derailment -- which are both ""shot right now"" -- may take weeks to repair. Cranes will have to remove the wreckage from the tracks once the NTSB has finished its on-site probe. Because of a bridge replacement project, those two tracks are the only way in and out of New York City by train from that part of Connecticut. Malloy said the state would set up a system taking rail Metro-North patrons from Bridgeport to the closest operable station, in South Norwalk, during the shutdown.

"(CNN) -- The FBI said Thursday it confirmed the presence of the deadly poison ricin in letters sent to President Barack Obama, a U.S. senator and a judge. Earlier, an Elvis impersonator charged in the case appeared in federal court in Oxford Mississippi. During a four-minute hearing, Magistrate Judge S. Allan Alexander ordered Paul Kevin Curtis -- who appeared in court with attorney Christi McCoy -- to remain in custody until a grand jury issues an expected indictment and a preliminary and detention hearing on April 29. In confirming the letters tested positive for ricin, the FBI said it was ""not aware of any illness as a result of exposure to these letters."" Further tests were being conducted, the FBI statement said. Curtis, 45, a resident of Corinth, Mississippi, was charged with sending a threat to the president. Curtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, told CNN in an e-mail that ""Mr. Curtis vehemently denies the allegations against him."" A criminal complaint charged Curtis with ""knowingly depositing for conveyance in the mail and for delivery from any post office any letter, paper, writing or document containing threats to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States."" The federal complaint further charges him with sending ""communications addressed to other persons, and containing a threat to injure the person of others."" Curtis was to appear Friday in U.S. District Court in Oxford, Mississippi, for a detention hearing. An affidavit in support of the criminal complaint cites the mailing of envelopes containing typewritten letters and ""a suspicious granular substance"" to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, the president and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi. According to the department, all three letters were typed on yellow paper and read as follows: . ""No one wanted to listen to me before. There are still 'Missing Pieces' Maybe I have your attention now . Even if that means someone must die. This must stop. To see a wrong and not expose it, . is to become a silent partner to its continuance . I am KC and I approve this message"" The letter addressed to Wicker and bearing no return address was intercepted by the U.S. Senate Mail Facility in Landover, Maryland, and the FBI was alerted of it Tuesday, the affidavit says. Three of four field tests conducted on the powder inside the envelope addressed to Wicker tested positive for a protein that later tests determined to be ricin, a lethal toxin, it says. A fourth test proved inconclusive. Capitol Police learned from Wicker's staff that Curtis had sent similar messages to the senator and that Curtis had posted on his blog in 2010 that he was writing a novel about black-market body parts titled ""Missing Pieces,"" the affidavit says. Letters to Obama and Holland also cited the book, it adds. A similar letter -- bearing no return address and postmarked April 8 -- was sent to Holland at her office in Tupelo. It too contained a ""suspicious granular substance"" that has yet to be tested, the affidavit says. A similar substance found Tuesday in an envelope addressed to Obama tested positive for ricin in a field test, it says. The three letters all contained ""the same verbiage, font, style and paper color,"" it says. The letters were postmarked Memphis, Tennessee, which is typically the postmark that letters mailed from northern Mississippi bear, it says. On his Facebook page, Curtis posted the same quote: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner in its continuance,"" the affidavit says. Sgt. Corrie Robbins of the Booneville Police Department in Mississippi told investigators that Curtis had been investigated several times since 2007, the affidavit says. It adds that Curtis' ex-wife reported to police in 2007 that he was ""extremely delusional, anti-government, and felt the government was spying on him with drones."" If convicted, Curtis will face a maximum of 15 years in prison, $500,000 in fines and three years of supervised release. Wicker said Thursday that he met Curtis about a decade ago. ""He's an entertainer,"" the senator said. ""He's an Elvis impersonator, and he entertained at a party that my wife and I helped give for a young couple that was getting married. He was quite entertaining."" The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Mississippi, posted photographs of a man it identified as Curtis. In one photograph, he is shown under an ""Elvis"" sign holding a microphone as he appears to be singing. He is wearing a white suit and sporting long sideburns and swept-back hair. A Kevin Curtis Live Facebook page describes him a ""Master of Impressions performing 'Tribute to the Stars' for audiences of all ages!"" The FBI arrested him on Wednesday at his home in Corinth. What is ricin? Letters put focus on Texas chiropractor's words . The line in the letters about exposing ""a wrong"" comes from John Raymond Baker, a longtime Texas chiropractor, his wife said. It's been widely quoted online, but Tammy Baker sounded surprised that it was used in the letters under scrutiny in Washington. When contacted by CNN, she said that she was not aware of the letters and that the phrase refers to her husband's general philosophy of care. She said their office phone rang frequently Wednesday afternoon, which was ""kind of freaking out our other employee."" A 2006 post on a blog for Baker's office said the comment originally was a criticism of insurance companies. Since then, the site said, it ""has been a quote that has been picked up and quoted (sometimes without attribution) around the net"" and ""people are using it about all kinds of injustices."" Mail for members of Congress and the White House has been handled at off-site postal facilities since the 2001 anthrax attacks, which targeted Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota. On heightened alert . Suspicious letters in Michigan and Arizona, too . Investigators are trying to determine whether suspicious letters found at Senate offices elsewhere in the country came from the same source, federal law enforcement sources said. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said one of his home-state offices received a ""suspicious-looking"" letter and alerted authorities. ""We do not know yet if the mail presented a threat,"" said Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. A staffer for Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake flagged ""suspicious letters"" at the freshman Republican's Phoenix office, Flake spokeswoman Genevieve Rozansky said in a statement, but ""no dangerous material was detected in the letters."" Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Jonathan Jacobs said the envelope contained a powder. The person who found the envelope was being treated at a Phoenix-area hospital for a pre-existing condition and stress from the event, and others in the immediate vicinity were examined as well. In a statement issued Wednesday, the FBI said it has no indication of a connection between the letters and Monday's bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Ricin is easily made . Ricin is a toxic substance that can be produced easily and cheaply from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms, an amount the size of the head of a pin, can kill an adult. There is no test for exposure and no antidote. Experts say it is more effective for use against individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction. Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while awaiting a bus in London and died four days later. A ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified it in a letter in a Senate mail room that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office. The discovery led 16 employees to undergo decontamination; none was sickened, Frist said.

"London, England (CNN) -- Pat Croce is a man on a mission -- a mission to find his all time favorite pirate. The highly successful businessman, who rose from being a trainer in the locker room to president of one of the most storied franchises of the NBA, is on a quest to find the body of English explorer Sir Francis Drake, who was buried out at sea more than 400 years ago. Sir Francis Drake was an adventurer and a true pirate of the 16th century. Drake is credited with being the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe. He led several voyages, many of them aimed at capturing Spanish territories and taking their treasure. While he made enemies with Spain, he enchanted Queen Elizabeth I, who is believed to have fondly called him ""my pirate"". But the Spanish got their revenge. Drake's voyage to the West Indies was disastrous, with the Spanish fleets prepared for the English. The adventure was to be his last and in 1596 he fell ill with dysentery. Dressed in armor, Drake's body was placed in a lead casket and thrown overboard off the coast of Panama. Days later two ships in the fleet were scuttled nearby, ensuring they wouldn't get into the hands of Drake's enemy, the Spanish. Now, centuries after he was laid to rest, Croce is on a quest to locate Drake's coffin. ""I'm a businessman with a passion for pirates and I'm all about taking action on your passion,"" Croce enthuses. Croce has invested a great deal of time and money -- somewhere in the region of hundreds of thousands of dollars according to some experts -- into finding Drake's final resting place. Last month he had a major breakthrough. Armed with high-tech equipment, a team of archeologists and divers and using the information given to him by a researcher he has hired -- Croce set about combing the seabed in an area off the Panama coast. What they came across Croce describes as a tremendous find. They uncovered two ships that appeared to be burnt out, lying perpendicular to one another, in an area which Croce now likes to call 'Drake's alcove'. They didn't find a name on either ships, or the ships' bells, yet Croce and experts are quite convinced the ships are the ""Delight"" and ""Elizabeth"" -- the two ships in Drake's final voyage that were scuttled. Croce's passion for pirates is colossal. What started as a hobby as a child has exploded into a business empire, with books and a Hollywood movie project in the pipeline. The American businessman has even established 'The St Augustine Pirate and Treasure Museum' to share all the treasures he's collected over the years. But it is Drake that he admires and relates to the most. ""He was an entrepreneur of his day,"" explains Croce. ""He talked investors into investing into his adventures and then brought back a return on the investment."" It's not just Drake's business brain that Croce has a high regard for, but also his rise from commoner to knighthood -- a journey not too distant from Croce's own. ""I was a trainer who eventually owned a basketball team. That's unheard of!"" Croce, a physiotherapist by trade, made his fortune by building up, and eventually selling, a successful sports medicine business. His term as president of the Philadelphia 76ers will go down in folklore, with the side going from last place to first in NBA standings. It is Croce's dream to one day see Drake's body eventually returned to Britain and buried in Plymouth with drums sounding and overseen by Queen Elizabeth II, the monarch who shares the same name as the royal who thought of Drake as her own private. For the moment though, another mission will require a permit from the Panama government to continue diving off its coast. However Croce believes they can't be far off locating Drake's coffin. While Drake would return to England with stolen Spanish treasure, for Croce he says his lost treasure is Drake's coffin and the history behind it. ""All I can say to my man Sir Francis Drake is: I'll be back,"" he says.","English explorer Sir Francis Drake was buried at sea 400 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for New York City asked a federal appeals court Saturday to void the order issued in August that required the New York Police Department to change its stop-and-frisk policy. The city's request was made to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. It asked the appeals court to vacate U.S District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin's rulings because they ""continue unfairly and improperly to cloud the public's perception"" of the New York Police Department. A three-judge panel of the appeals court removed Scheindlin from the case in October because she appeared to be biased, jeopardizing ""the appearance of partiality ... by a series of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District Court."" The appeals court cited three interviews with the New York Law Journal, The Associated Press and The New Yorker in which Scheindlin spoke about her personal beliefs on the issue and defended her decision. In August, Scheindlin ordered that the stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it is unconstitutional in part because it unlawfully targets blacks and Latinos. City officials had bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects and appealed the ruling. Scheindlin ruled that the policy violated the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion. She also found evidence of racial profiling, which violated the plaintiffs' 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection. The lower court ruling to change stop-and-frisk is on hold while the city's appeal proceeds. Scheindlin is challenging her removal from the litigation. Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio opposes stop-and-frisk and has said publicly that he would drop the city's appeal of Scheindlin's ruling. The stop-and-frisk policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they deem suspicious, even if they've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent times. Civil rights and civil liberties groups challenge the practice as racist and illegal. Outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg, law enforcement and other proponents say the policy reduces crime.

"(CNN) -- Notre Dame star linebacker Manti Te'o acknowledged to ABC's Katie Couric that he maintained the illusion of his dead girlfriend in the weeks after he received a call claiming that Lennay Kekua and her death were hoaxes. It wasn't that teo was lying, said spokesman Mathew Hiltzik, who also reportedly represents Couric. Rather, he was still trying to determine exactly what had happened after learning a woman he thought was his girlfriend may never have existed. Opinion: Te'o story, big fail for sportswriters . During the interview, set to air on Couric's syndicated show Thursday, the Heisman Trophy runner-up said he mentioned Kekua and her death to reporters after receiving a December 6 phone call from someone he thought was Kekua, saying she was not dead. ""Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12,"" Te'o said, according to clips released on the ABC News website. Te'o has said he believed Kekua, whom he thought was his girlfriend despite never meeting her face to face, had died of leukemia on September 12 after a car accident left her hospitalized. ""Now I get a phone call on December 6, saying that she's alive and then I'm going be put on national TV two days later. And to ask me about the same question. You know, what would you do?"" Te'o said, according to clips of the interview. Opinion: Why we fell for Manti Te'o story . On December 8, ahead of the Heisman Trophy presentation, Te'o said he ""lost both my grandparents and my girlfriend to cancer."" In a New York Post interview published more than three weeks later, Te'o said memories of his grandfather helped him cope with the losses of his grandmother and girlfriend, whom he'd previously said died on the same day. ""So when I lost my grandmother and Lennay, I thought of him. He was my strength,"" Te'o told the Post, according to a December 30 article. It was true that his grandmother had died, but Te'o conceded that he mentioned Kekua again even after -- as Couric put it -- he ""knew that something was amiss,"" according to the interview clips. While he said he didn't know whether the now-debunked storyline helped him place second in Heisman Trophy voting, he insisted his emotions surrounding Kekua's loss were authentic. ""What I went through was real. You know, the feelings, the pain, the sorrow -- that was all real, and that's something that I can't fake,"" he said. Who's who on the Internet? Who knows . Couric said she believes Te'o sincerely thought he was having a relationship with Kekua. Couric said she heard voice mail messages on Te'o's phone, allegedly from Kekua, and even saw his phone bill. ""There were multiple calls to this number, where he would stay on the phone for hours,"" Couric told ABC's ""World News with Diane Sawyer"" on Wednesday. Te'o denied reveling in the attention he received for playing so outstandingly on the gridiron after suffering such devastating personal losses. ""I think, for me, the only thing that I basked in was that I had an impact on people; that people turned to me for inspiration. And I think that was the only thing I focused on,"" the Hawaii-born Mormon said. ""My story, I felt, was a guy who in times of hardship and in times of trial, held strong to his faith, held strong to his family, and I felt that was my story."" Te'o's parents, Brian and Ottilia Te'o, were on hand for the interview. Couric said she believes they were as stunned as their son when they found out Kekua didn't exist. Te'o's mother talked to the woman many times on the phone, and his father texted biblical passages to the woman and discussed them with her, Couric said. Te'o's father was quoted in an October article in the South Bend Tribune, saying his son and Kekua had met at a football game in Palo Alto, California, and exchanged numbers. Their love affair ensued from there, the paper reported. Manti Te'o: A linebacker, a made-up girlfriend and a national hoax . Last week, Te'o said, however, that he had lied to his dad because he was embarrassed to admit he was in love with a woman he'd never laid eyes on. ""I knew that -- I even knew that it was crazy that I was with somebody that I didn't meet,"" he told ESPN. ""And that alone, people find out that this girl who died I was so invested in, and I didn't meet her as well."" Asked his response to those who say his son is a liar who ""manipulated the truth, really for personal gain,"" Te'o's father gave a tearful reply, according to ABC. ""People can speculate about what they think he is. I've known him 21 years of his life, and he's not a liar. He's a kid,"" Te'o's father told Couric. Questions have also been raised about Te'o telling Sports Illustrated in October that Kekua had attended one of his games, when he issued a statement last week saying he'd never met her. Because ABC News has made public only snippets of the interview, it's not clear which parts of the hoax Te'o will address, but the Notre Dame standout has said he's sure he'll be vindicated. Read a timeline of events in the Te'o hoax . ""When (people) hear the facts, they'll know,"" Te'o told ESPN last week. ""They'll know that there is no way that I could be part of this."" Nine days after the Alabama Crimson Tide dismantled the Fighting Irish in the college football national championship, Deadspin broke the story that Kekua didn't exist. The oft-irreverent sports news website has reported that a man named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo is involved in the scam and that he created a fake Twitter account for Kekua. Deadspin's Timothy Burke, co-author of the story, said friends and relatives of Tuiasosopo's said he was ""doing the Lennay Kekua fake online profile for several years and that he's caught other people in his trap, but that they caught on way earlier than Manti Te'o did."" Diane O'Meara, whose photo was used for the fake account, told NBC's ""Today"" show that she'd never spoken to Te'o but that Tuiasosopo called her to apologize. ""Ronaiah has called and not only confessed, but he has also apologized, but I don't think there's anything you could say to me that would fix this,"" she said. Watch a clip of O'Meara's interview . Te'o, likewise, told ESPN that Tuiasosopo tweeted him after the Deadspin story broke, saying he was behind the hoax. He apologized, Te'o said. ""Two guys and a girl are responsible for the whole thing,"" Te'o said, according to ESPN. An anonymous Notre Dame source told CNN the university's investigation yielded the same conclusion -- that two men and a woman perpetrated the hoax. At least one of Tuiasosopo's relatives has defended him, though. His uncle told CNN, ""It definitely takes two to tango,"" and, ""This is not just a matter of blaming it all on Ronaiah."" Tuiasosopo's father had no comment. Burke said he isn't buying the notion that Te'o is innocent and emphasizes that Te'o and Tuiasosopo knew each other. ""How dense would Manti Te'o have to be to not realize this was his friend who was behind the account the entire time?"" he asked. ""I don't believe Manti Te'o could be that dumb.""

"(CNN) -- A surprise inspection by the Centers for Disease Control has resulted in a failing grade for one of the plushest cruise ships afloat. According to a report by the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, the cruise ship Silver Shadow was cited repeatedly for using an ""organized effort"" to remove 15 trolleys of food from the ship's galley to individual crew cabins to ""avoid inspection."" The snap inspection of the Silver Shadow on June 17 in Skagway, Alaska, was conducted after an anonymous crew member sent still photographs to the CDC showing meat in crew cabin sinks and trays of food in the corridors in the hallways outside those cabins. It resulted in a failing grade of 82 for the Silver Shadow. Any grade less than 84 is considered ""less than satisfactory,"" according to the VSP website. In its advertisements Silversea Cruises, the cruise line that owns the Silver Shadow, emphasizes luxury and what it calls a ""world class"" culinary experience. The company said its ships have an average passenger load of a little more than 300 compared to some cruise lines with ships that carry anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 passengers. The company said it charges passengers an average of $5,000 per week to sail. One crew member who was on board the Silver Shadow said that his superiors ordered him and other crew members to sleep with food inside their cabins. Adriano Colonna, who had a 40-day contract to serve as a pastry chef on the vessel, said a trolley full of salami and even unrefrigerated blue cheese was stored in crew cabins. Colonna said food was hidden night after night to avoid health inspections. Passengers lack public info on cruise ship crime . A spokeswoman for the Fort Lauderdale-based Silversea Cruises, Ltd. e-mailed CNN prior to the public posting of the CDC score, stating that the firm was ""deeply disappointed"" in the outcome of the inspection. In fact, Gina Finocchiaro said the final grade was an 84, although it actually turned out to be 82. The company said it had always scored in the highest range of grades in the past. Records published by the CDC showed that Silversea ships had been graded in the high 90s and even 100 on occasion. Finocchiaro said the Silver Shadow inspection last month in Alaska was an anomaly. Neither she nor anyone else at the company responded to questions from CNN asking whether any employees were disciplined. Jim Walker -- a Miami-based lawyer who specializes in filing lawsuits against cruise lines for injury and wrongful termination -- said that, in his experience, it's common for cruise ships to hide food from government inspectors. ""There is typically a scramble that takes place,"" he said. ""That's what we learn from crew members."" Walker, who wrote about the Silver Star incident on his website cruiselaw.com, said he believes managers on board the ship ""were essentially caught playing a game."" ""The CDC was alerted by crew members who were concerned about the hygiene on the ship and they went in and verified their complaints,"" he said. According to the CDC final report, its inspectors poured chlorine liquid over the discarded food on board the Silver Shadow to prevent any of it from being re-used. Other than a promise to correct actions that led to the problems, the owners of the ship were not fined, nor was the ship stopped from proceeding on its scheduled trip along Alaska's Inland Passage to Juneau. That's because the CDC has no authority to correct any of the issues. The CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program employs inspectors from the U.S. Public Health Service and, even though it's a considered a regulatory program, it only has the authority to ask the cruise line to correct its actions. ""VSP requires all ships to submit corrective action statements for deficiencies,"" the program states on its website. ""VSP does not verify that the deficiencies have been corrected until after conducting the next vessel inspection or re-inspection."" In a cruise ship crisis, what should happen? This year, six cruise ships, including the Silver Shadow, have received failing grades by the CDC, according to its database. That's three times more than the number of cruise ships that failed inspections in 2012. CDC spokeswoman Bernadette Burden noted that ""every case is different,"" and each case goes through several reviews before scores are finally posted. The cruise industry has been in the spotlight after a series of disasters that have captured headlines. The Costa Concordia hit a reef off the coast of Italy in January 2012, killing 32 people. Then there was February's Carnival Triumph cruise, which experienced an engine fire in the control room that led to a loss of electrical power for five days. In May, Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas caught fire, forcing the ship to cut short the trip. Nevertheless, a recent survey by J.D. Power and Associates found overall customer satisfaction with eight major cruise lines remains high. Disney Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International and Holland America Line came in first, second and third, respectively, in customer satisfaction, while Carnival ranked last. Silversea Cruises was not included in the survey, which survey measured seven factors that affect a customer's experience: service, state of the room, food, the efficiency of boarding and departing on the ship, entertainment, cost and excursions. 5 things we've learned about cruising .

"(CNN) -- As U.S. President Barack Obama set a January deadline for proposals to deal with gun violence, new details emerged Wednesday about the mother of the gunman who killed 27 people in a Connecticut shooting rampage last week. A day before her son killed her, Nancy Lanza was on vacation alone at a luxury resort in New Hampshire, friends said Wednesday. Lanza checked in to the Omni Mount Washington Resort & Hotel in Bretton Woods last Tuesday and checked out Thursday afternoon, the hotel said. Less than a day later, authorities say, her son Adam Lanza killed her and then opened fire in Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 20 children and six adults there. Road trips alone were not uncommon for Nancy Lanza, according to her friends, who said she seemed to be in good spirits during the trip and felt comfortable leaving her 20-year-old son unsupervised in recent years. Authorities have said the shooter took three of his mother's weapons -- two handguns and a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle -- to the elementary school Friday. His deadly shooting rampage has ignited renewed national debates over gun control, mental health care and school safety. Speaking five days after the massacre, Obama said Wednesday that a new group led by Vice President Joe Biden is charged with developing ""concrete proposals"" for dealing with gun violence ""no later than January."" The group will include some Cabinet members and outside organizations. ""This is not some Washington commission. This is not something where folks are going to be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside,"" Obama said. ""This is a team that has a very specific task to pull together real reforms right now."" While politicians continued to call for action, singer Paul Simon offered a tribute to a beloved Sandy Hook teacher who died trying to save her students. A statement from Simon's publicist said teacher Victoria ""Vicki"" Soto's parents were family friends. At their request, on Wednesday he sang ""The Sound of Silence"" at her funeral. Read more: NRA breaks silence . Pushing Congress . No single law or set of laws can prevent gun violence, Obama said Wednesday, but the complexity of the issue ""can no longer be an excuse for doing nothing."" Authorities must work to make ""access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun,"" and the country needs to tackle a ""culture that all too often glorifies guns and violence,"" he said. Speaking at a news conference, Obama called for quick action from Congress. ""A majority of Americans support banning the sale of military-style assault weapons. A majority of Americans support banning the sale of high-capacity ammunition clips. A majority of Americans support laws requiring background checks before all gun purchases so that criminals can't take advantage of legal loopholes to buy a gun from somebody who won't take the responsibility of doing a background check at all,"" he said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, has said she will introduce legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that the president supports that effort. Obama said Wednesday he believes the Second Amendment does guarantee individuals the right to bear arms. And, he added, ""This country has a strong tradition of gun ownership that's been handed down from generation to generation."" After last week's shooting, some have said future tragedies can be avoided by arming teachers. Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said if more guns had been at Sandy Hook Elementary School, most victims would be alive. Even though all states allow concealed carry, ""we have laws that say not in schools,"" Pratt said. ""And so in the very places that have been sought out by monsters such as the murderer of these adults and children, we're saying, no, we don't want you to be able to defend yourself. It's better that you just sit there and wait to be killed. And we find that morally incomprehensible."" Meanwhile, Newtown United, a newly formed group in the stricken town, held a meeting Wednesday evening to discuss what it calls ""sensible gun legislation."" ""We are not looking to ban guns,"" said Lillian Bittman, former chairwoman of the Newtown Board of Education. ""We are looking for a civil discussion of gun control, mental health, school safety and school facilities, so that we as a nation can work together to come up with a solution."" Last week's school shooting is a tipping point, she said. ""We have 20 children that are trying to point us the way,"" she said. ""And if we don't follow their lead, then their deaths are in vain."" Read more: Newtown United tries to tackle gun policy . Newtown buries the dead . Residents of the close-knit community have been braving cold, rainy weather and waiting for up to five hours to pay their respects to the victims of last week's shooting, Bittman said. ""It's an assembly line of wakes and funerals,"" she said. ""We can't even figure out which ones to go to, there are so many."" On Wednesday, a police honor guard saluted Soto, a first-grade teacher who died trying to shield her students from bullets, as bagpipers played outside the Lordship Community Church in Stratford, Connecticut. The church set up more than 100 chairs outside the building to accommodate the overflow of people paying their respects. ""You were an angel to those 19 children you protected, to the 19 families and the community,"" Soto's sister Jillian said at the service. Soto, 27, wanted to be a teacher since she was 3 years old. She ""instinctively went into action when a monster came into her classroom and tried to protect the kids that she loved so much,"" cousin James Wiltsie said. ""We just want the public to know that Vicki was a hero."" U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan traveled to Newtown to pay his respects to the family of school principal Dawn Hochsprung and ""to hear from educators on how we can help,"" he said on Twitter. Hochsprung's family had calling hours scheduled for Wednesday. Her funeral will be private on Thursday and held outside of Connecticut. Several students were honored in funerals Wednesday: . -- Seven-year-old Daniel Barden, whose ""fearless"" pursuit of happiness earned him ripped jeans. Taking after his musician dad, Daniel formed a band with his brother and sister, playing the drums. ""He embodied everything that is wholesome and innocent in the world,"" Daniel's family said. -- Six-year-old Caroline Previdi's relatives were saying their final goodbyes Wednesday. Even after her death, 6-year-old Caroline continued to touch the lives of others. A Facebook page called ""RIP Caroline Previdi -- Sandy Hook Massacre Victim"" had more than 5,400 ""likes"" on Wednesday morning. -- Six-year-old Charlotte Bacon also had a burial scheduled for Wednesday. Charlotte was a beaming bundle of energy under bright red curls. Black hearses with caskets will continue driving through Newtown for days to come.

"(CNN) -- No one ordered a full search for a missing San Francisco hospital patient until nine days after she disappeared, authorities say. Nine days. In that time, Lynne Spalding Ford's family scoured the city and passed out thousands of fliers -- only to find out she was dead in a stairwell at the same hospital. Now, authorities have revealed a series of mishaps leading up to the discovery of Spalding Ford's body at San Francisco General Hospital -- 17 days after she was reported missing. Lawyer: Hospital staffer saw body in stairwell days earlier . Exactly when and how Spalding Ford died remains a mystery. But more clues are surfacing about her final days: . September 19 . Spalding Ford, 57, checks into San Francisco General Hospital for a bladder infection. September 21 . A hospital employee calls the sheriff's department in the morning and says Spalding Ford has been missing for 40 minutes, San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said. The caller also describes the patient as African-American -- even though the patient is later described as Asian in a sheriff's department log book. The sheriff's department oversees security on the hospital's campus. Authorities make a perimeter search of the hospital grounds, but deputies didn't immediately classify the woman as a missing person. Later that day, evening shift deputies stationed at the hospital didn't get briefed about Spalding Ford from the earlier deputies. September 25 . Four days after Spalding Ford's disappearance, the San Francisco Police Department asks the sheriff's department to pull surveillance video to see if there are any images of the patient leaving. September 26 . The sheriff's department tries to look through the surveillance footage, but can't ""due to hardware problems,"" Mirkarimi said. The vendor responsible for maintaining the video equipment was notified. September 30 . Nine days after Spalding Ford went missing, the hospital asked sheriff's deputies to search its entire 24-acre campus. But that search didn't include all stairwells. October 1 . After realizing not all stairwells had been searched, a deputy and staff went to scour the stairwells. But only about half of them were searched. October 3 . The video equipment vendor manages to recover surveillance video from the hard drive, and images are given to San Francisco police the next day. October 4 . A hospital employee tells the sheriff's department that someone reported a person lying on the 3rd- or 4th-floor landing of Stairwell 8. ""The Communications Center staff responded, 'We'll take care of it,'"" the sheriff said. ""There is no indication that anyone was dispatched to that stairwell."" That same day, an employee on the fifth floor reported hearing banging coming from Stairwell 8, a hospital official said, according to Spalding Ford's family attorney Haig Harris. A hospital spokeswoman later confirmed that the official called Harris, but did not elaborate on the conversation. October 8 . A hospital engineering employee who was conducting a routine check found Spalding Ford's body in an exterior stairwell. The hospital and sheriff's department said the alarmed stairwell, which exits to the hospital grounds at the bottom, ""is a fire exit that is not routinely used by staff, patients or the public."" The aftermath . The sheriff's department said it's implemented a series of new policies since Spalding Ford's death, including daily patrols of fire exit stairwells and working with hospital staff to repair faulty alarms. ""I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Lynne Spalding Ford,"" Mirkarimi said. ""We have taken immediate measures to address and make certain such a tragedy never happens again."" Mirkarimi said his department will review technical problems, such as faulty surveillance equipment and the fact that parts of the hospital were not covered by cameras. He also said policies and procedures of the deputies at the hospital will be reviewed. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","Lynne Spalding Ford checked into a San Francisco hospital on September 19 .

"(CNN) -- The first line in most of the early obituaries of Lou Reed described him primarily as lead singer for the Velvet Underground. This is somewhat like starting an obituary for Abraham Lincoln by saying he was president of he United States during the Civil War. Or, more to the point, that Thelonious Monk played piano or that Bob Dylan was a folk singer. In each case, it's a start. At the same time, it doesn't begin telling you what's important to know. In fact, what I've been hearing and reading online from friends and others, since word came Sunday of Reed's death at age 71, were reactions that vibrated with emotional intensity and startling intimacy. ""He changed my life"" was a recurring theme, as was ""I wouldn't have been a ______ without him."" And you could fill in the blank with any or all of the following: poet, artist, musician, singer, writer, performer, iconoclast, New Yorker -- all of which Lou Reed was. And the example he set in those roles empowered generations as decisively and enduringly as such disparate peers as Dylan, John Lennon, Brian Wilson and others who made the '60s (and a lot that came afterward) possible. ""He was as gifted, as important and influential, as any artist of the last fifty years,"" wrote Mikal Gilmore, a writer and rock journalist whose own work, including the 2001 memoir ""Shot in the Heart,"" has evoked some of the same darkness, mordancy and pungent wit that filtered through Reed's songs. ""And he was a great favorite of mine since the day I first heard the Velvet Underground's debut as I was sitting on the floor of the Psychedelic Shop in Portland, Oregon in the summer of 1967."" ""Even though I knew (Reed) was sick, I thought he'd last forever"" was another recurring theme that one read in blogs and social media postings. This seemed aligned with the perception of Reed as a hard-bitten survivor of drug abuse and other wretched excesses who continued to put out trenchant albums, alienate journalists, and inspire independent rockers and others who sought the cutting edge he helped define. Michael Hogan's Vanity Fair blog -- which celebrated Reed as ""the last of the old New York characters, a true curmudgeon"" -- alluded to the knowingly affectionate jibes many people made over Reed's liver transplant this past spring. ""Look what he did to the last one, people said,"" wrote Hogan. ""And it's true that Lou Reed put his body through hell back in the day. He eventually cleaned up his habits but he never softened up."" The YouTube postings of Reed's performances also blanketed the social media landscape. ""Walk on the Wild Side"" and ""Sweet Jane,"" arguably his two most widely successful and recognized singles, were the most frequently shared. Some reached back to the 1967 album that started it all, ""The Velvet Underground and Nico,"" by posting such songs as ""I'm Waiting for the Man,"" ""Venus in Furs"" and ""Heroin"" -- songs that took their listeners to dark, forbidding places many of them weren't ready to go, whether it was the dark corridors of a Harlem brownstone to buy hard drugs or even harder-core rituals of sadomasochistic sex. Over time, the album would become the hallowed cornerstone of such iconoclastic offshoots of the rock-pop universe as new wave, punk and indie rock. It also created a space where a new kind of romantic vision of outlaw street life would seize the imaginations not only of musicians, but of artists, writers and filmmakers. There were even those who insisted on posting, in its entirety, Reed's 1975 experimental LP, ""Metal Machine Music,"" consisting almost entirely of guitar feedback running at different speeds. It sounds just as confounding and fascinating now as it did to listeners in the mid-'70s. But as with all of Reed's music, scary and wistful, funny and sad, tender and spiteful, these strange sounds, whatever their reason for existing, will remain a thrown gauntlet to anyone who's alienated themselves from the status quo to make something of their own that confuses or arouses people to think differently about their surroundings. As Gilmore wrote, ""There always seemed something indomitable about (Reed) and his commitment. Today, especially, he still seems indomitable."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Reactions to Reed's death showed emotional intensity and intimacy, writes Gene Seymour .

"(Wired.com) -- In an abrupt about-face in its mobile software strategy, Adobe will soon cease developing its Flash Player plug-in for mobile browsers, according to an e-mail sent to Adobe partners on Tuesday evening. And with that e-mail flash, Adobe has signaled that it knows, as Steve Jobs predicted, the end of the Flash era on the web is coming soon. The e-mail, obtained and first reported on by ZDNet, says that Adobe will no longer continue to ""adapt Flash Player for mobile devices to new browser, OS version or device configurations,"" instead focusing on alternative application packaging programs and the HTML5 protocol. ""Our future work with Flash on mobile devices will be focused on enabling Flash developers to package native apps with Adobe AIR for all the major app stores,"" the quoted e-mail says. In the past, Adobe has released software tools for mobile developers that create a single platform programmers can use to make applications that work across three major mobile platforms: Android, iOS and the BlackBerry OS. While it's seemingly easier than learning all of the native languages for each operating system, some developers have claimed a loss in app performance when coding in a non-native language that then gets translated into other languages. The move indicates a massive backpedaling on Adobe's part, a company who championed its Flash platform in the face of years of naysaying about its use on mobile devices. Despite Flash's near ubiquity across desktop PCs, many in the greater computing industry, including, famously, Apple Computer, have denounced the platform as fundamentally unstable on mobile browsers, and an intense battery drain. In effect, Flash's drawbacks outweigh the benefits on mobile devices. Flash became a dominant desktop platform by allowing developers to code interactive games, create animated advertisements and deliver video to any browser that had the plugin installed, without having to take into account the particulars of any given browser. However, with the development of Javascript, CSS, and HTML5, which has native support for video, many web developers are turning away from Flash, which can be a resource hog even on the most advanced browsers. Apple made its biggest waves in the case against Flash in April of last year, when Steve Jobs penned a 1,500-word screed against the controversial platform, describing it as a technology of the past. Jobs and Apple disliked the platform so intensely, it has since been barred from use on all iOS devices. Despite attempts to breathe life into Flash on other mobile devices -- namely, Android and BlackBerry OS -- Adobe has failed to deliver a consistently stable version of the platform on a smartphone or tablet. In WIRED's testing of the BlackBerry PlayBook in April, Flash use caused the browser to crash on a consistent basis. And when Flash was supposed to come to tablets with Motorola's Xoom, Adobe was only able to provide an highly unstable Beta version of Flash to ship with the flagship Android device. ""Adobe has lost so much credibility with the community that I'm hoping they are bought by someone else that can bring some stability and eventually some credibility back to the Flash Platform,"" wrote software developer Dan Florio in a blog post on Wednesday morning. The drastic reversal in Adobe's mobile plans comes in the wake of the company cutting 750 jobs on Tuesday, a move prompted by what Adobe labeled ""corporate restructuring.""

"New Orleans (CNN) -- Nearly 30 years ago, Lisa Fitzpatrick was the target of a gang initiation. She had pulled off the highway in Oklahoma City, to buy something at a convenience store, when a car pulled up alongside hers. She noticed two 12-year-olds struggling with something in the back seat. Suddenly, they were pointing a gun at her. ""I saw their faces, and they were terrified,"" she said. Then the shot rang out. The bullet only grazed Fitzpatrick, leaving a scar near her nose, but the incident changed the way she thought about gang violence. She said she later learned from police that the children were told they had to kill someone that night or someone in their family would suffer violent consequences. ""I wasn't the victim that night, I was the collateral damage,"" said Fitzpatrick, now 50. ""The victims were the two babies in the back seat holding the gun. It turned my view upside down about who the victims are. Sometimes, it's the person pulling the trigger."" More than two decades later, Fitzpatrick was living in New Orleans when she once again had a brush with street violence. Driving home from her job as an executive at a health-care company, she found her street blocked by police tape. Someone her daughter knew had been killed -- the unintended victim of a drive-by shooting. For Fitzpatrick, that was the turning point. ""It was just too much,"" she said. ""Too many young men were lying face down in their own blood. I didn't want it to be normal anymore. I didn't want the children to think that this was normal. I had to do something."" Fitzpatrick quit her job, downsized her life and created the APEX Youth Center. Since 2010, more than 460 children and young adults have come to the center to spend their free time and escape the violence on the streets. ""We offer a space out of the path of the bullet, where a young man can put 6 inches of cinder block between him and violence outside,"" Fitzpatrick said. More on CNN: New Orleans looks to shake Murder City title . APEX, which stands for Always Pursuing Excellence, includes fun activities such as basketball, video games and pool. But it also provides mentoring, tutoring and job training so that young people can set themselves on a path to a brighter future. ""We're empowering our young men and women to ... find out what they might want to do,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""We work on finding our passion."" APEX draws young people from across the city, and the tensions that exist between different neighborhood factions can occasionally flare up. Fitzpatrick's ultimate goal is to teach them to work through those moments without resorting to violence. ""Statistics say that overwhelmingly, the young men being murdered on the street, they know their murderer,"" she said. ""If you go get your people, and I go get my people, all we're doing is perpetuating the cycle. ... So our point here is to stop."" ""Our motto is 'Reconciliation, never retaliation,' and that's a hard lesson in an eye-for-an-eye world,"" she said. ""What we do is (ask) ... 'How can we address this differently? What could we do to de-escalate this situation instead of escalate the situation?' I constantly ask questions. ... The young men come up with the answers."" Sometimes, they'll use words to calm a given situation. Other times, they'll have ""dance-offs"" or use other artistic endeavors. Whatever the method, Fitzpatrick knows that every situation that's negotiated peacefully gives young people tools they can use in the future. ""I wish I could tell you that I could get them to change their ways, (but) it doesn't work that way,"" she said. ""We give them the space and the opportunity to make that decision. What I have found is that no one has ever really given them the opportunity to make the choice. ""When I ask them why they hang out with (me) every Friday night, they say, 'Because you're the first person who ever let us in the door.' That is an indictment on our society."" Fitzpatrick is motivated, in part, by her religious beliefs. She serves as an associate pastor at a local Methodist church. But she said she doesn't force her religion on the children, and evangelizing is not allowed at APEX. ""Many of the kids ask me, 'Why are you here?' and I'm honest with them,"" she said. ""I'm here because it's the right thing to do, and I feel like it's what I'm meant to do, and that has a lot to do with my faith. ""This is a nondenominational center, but what I bring in is universal. It's about leading a nonviolent life."" When you look at Fitzpatrick -- a 50-year-old white woman -- you might not think she'd have much in common with the mostly African-American males that come to her center. But the reality is quite different. Michael Lewis, a 20-something young man at APEX, said he felt an ""instant connection"" with Fitzpatrick after hearing her past. Soon after, he was showing her his own bullet wounds and telling his story. ""I've kind of gone through a similar situation,"" he said. ""I've hung with the wrong crowd and did wrong things, and we all know when it's enough, right?"" Kendall Santacruze, 20, says the direction of his life was changed by Fitzpatrick's message. ""I'm not even going to lie to you: I was on the verge of getting ready to seriously hurt somebody,"" he said. ""Me and my friends actually had weapons. But Miss Lisa, she stopped us. ""Miss Lisa taught me how to deal with my anger; she taught me how to be in control of myself, (not) let others influence you."" Today, Santacruze helps others at APEX, where he sees young people facing the same struggles that he once did. ""I think to myself, 'That's exactly where I used to be,' "" he said. ""So I mentor them, I act as a role model to them. The little kids who come up to me, they hug me and they say they love me. It brings tears to my eyes at the end of the day, and it makes me happy to know that I'm actually influencing their lives. ""The way Miss Lisa influenced me is the same way I feel like I'm influencing them."" This peer-to-peer mentoring, and the fact that the majority of the young people that come to APEX are referred by their friends, confirms to Fitzpatrick that she's on the right track. While she's still in the process of assembling measurable data, she said she sees evidence of her impact every day. ""I've seen increases in GPAs, kids are getting jobs, recidivism has gone down,"" she said, noting that the one statistic she is most proud of is that almost all of the young people she's helped are still alive four years later. ""The successes of APEX are not necessarily going to Harvard or getting out of the neighborhood. (It's) when a kid like Kendall can live (here) and make a conscious choice every day to not be involved in the violence, spread the message of nonviolence, and work hard to get other kids to put down the gun. That's the success."" Fitzpatrick and her family have had to make sacrifices to keep APEX open, trading a five-bedroom house for a two-bedroom apartment. At one point, things got so tough that a woman bought Fitzpatrick groceries with her own food stamps. But Fitzpatrick said she wouldn't have it any other way. ""At the end of the day, my house and my cars, that was sticks and bricks, steels and wheels,"" she said. ""The kids, they give up everything to be here. That's my inspiration. I can't do anything else but be here."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- The White House asked Wednesday that a federal shield law be reintroduced in the Senate, a move that could affect the way the Justice Department conducts investigations into leaks of secret government information. Administration officials told CNN that the request was made to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York. It comes two days after the Associated Press announced that the Justice Department had seized some of its phone records as part of a national security leak investigation. ""This kind of law would balance national security needs against the public's right to the free flow of information,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""At minimum, our bill would have ensured a fairer, more deliberate process in this case."" The records covered a two-month period beginning in May 2012 and included more than 20 AP lines, including personal phones and AP phone numbers in New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington. ""A shield law would keep lazy prosecutors from going after reporters' notes and phone records and compel them to actually conduct investigations that do not step all over the First Amendment,"" Teri Hayt, the First Amendment chairwoman of the Associated Press Media Editors, said in a statement issued before the White House announcement. Federal shield legislation -- which would protect journalists from revealing their sources and beef up protections for reporters and their sources caught up in such probes -- passed the Judiciary Committee in 2009 but never advanced. The AP phone records controversy pits First Amendment advocates against an administration that has made unprecedented moves to end the leaking of government secrets in the name of national security. ""If there were a shield law and it said that the government has to let you know when it's subpoenaing your phone records, your hotel records or any other records that you don't have in your hands, that would have been a big help,"" said Chuck Tobin, chairman of the media law department at the law firm of Holland & Knight in Washington, who has represented the AP and CNN in the past. His comments too were made before the White House announcement. Related: Justice Department defends itself in AP snooping scandal . ""They kept that information from journalists and went to the phone company to prevent giving journalists the chance to fight in court,"" Tobin said in a telephone interview. ""That kind of end-run could be prevented if there were a federal shield law that required notice when the government goes after records from third parties."" He added, ""It's colossally troubling to everybody, and should be, that the government can come between journalists and their sources in this kind of an unfocused and unbridled fashion."" Typically, he said, the government negotiates with the news media to ensure that any subpoena is tailored as narrowly as possible. But in this instance, ""the government issued what appears to be an overbroad subpoena,"" skipping the step of notifying the journalists ahead of time, which would have given them the opportunity to challenge it. ""And they did it on purpose,"" he said. ""They did not want to give the journalists an opportunity to try to get this narrowed or quashed."" Justice Department regulations allow the government to seize records only in the case of ""a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation,"" Tobin said, adding that that did not appear to have been the case with the AP probe. ""It's hard to imagine that there was a substantial threat to an investigation of past events that would warrant not giving AP a chance to go to court on this issue,"" he said. ""That's deeply troubling."" The wire service said the investigation into its records appears related to an AP story about a thwarted terrorist plot in Yemen to bomb an airplane bound for the United States. ""These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know,"" said Gary Pruitt, AP's president and CEO, in a letter of protest sent Monday to Attorney General Eric Holder. Pruitt said Tuesday in a statement that the news organization had taken extraordinary measures to placate federal authorities, delaying publication of the story, at their request, ""until the government assured us that the national security concerns had passed."" At the time of publication, the administration itself was preparing to announce that the bomb plot had been foiled, he said. ""The White House had said there was no credible threat to the American people in May of 2012. The AP story suggested otherwise, and we felt that was important information and the public deserved to know it."" But Holder told reporters on Tuesday that the article that prompted the investigation was one of ""the top two or three most serious leaks that I've ever seen."" He testified Wednesday to the House Judiciary Committee that he could not comment on the matter because he had recused himself from the case to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest and that the matter was being handled by a deputy. Forty states have passed shield laws and nine others have de facto shield laws created by court decisions (Wyoming is the outlier), according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which offers legal advice and other resources to journalists. But the state laws confer no protection from federal actions like the one reported by the wire service. In the past decade, Congress has come close to passing a federal shield law. But support for the measure shrank during the WikiLeaks scandal in which thousands of classified U.S. diplomatic cables were released. Such a law could keep federal authorities from employing what some media lawyers decry as overly aggressive tactics. The issue has been muddied as the Internet has blurred the line between journalist and private citizen. Under a federal shield law introduced in 2011, the federal government would have had to prove to a judge that the information it was seeking outweighed the journalist's need to keep confidential information, according to the Society of Professional Journalists. Two years later, it remains in a subcommittee. The Justice Department's seizure of AP's phone records appears to have been legal, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""A lot of people think the First Amendment protects journalists from having to disclose this sort of information,"" he said Monday. ""Not true. Especially under federal law. There is no privilege to protect this kind of information."" But administrations since the Nixon White House have exercised restraint, he said. ""They have said, 'Look, we will do whatever we can to avoid having to subpoena journalists.'"" President Obama had indicated he would follow suit. A day after he entered office, on January 21, 2009, Obama said that he would embrace openness. ""Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency,"" he vowed. That promise has not been kept, legal analysts contend. The Obama administration has used the Espionage Act, which was passed in 1917, to target suspected leakers in six cases, twice the number undertaken by all previous administrations combined. Toobin said the AP's subpoena was particularly egregious. ""I have never heard of a subpoena this broad,"" he said. ""The administration is not violating the First Amendment, but they are certainly doing more than has ever been done before in pursuing the private information of journalists, and we will see if there is any political check on them, because there doesn't appear to be any legal check on what they're doing."" Such seizures risk turning the news media's news-gathering process into an investigative tool of the government, said Gene Policinski, senior vice president and executive director of the First Amendment Center. ""Reporters become effectively recorders of contacts and information for the prosecution, not at all what journalism is supposed to be."" But a former spokesman for the Department of Justice who worked as an aide to Holder defended the government's actions. ""What they're trying to find out through this investigation is what government official broke the oath that they signed to protect classified information,"" said Matthew Miller, who left the Justice Department in 2011 and is now a public affairs consultant in private practice. ""There is no reporters' privilege in law protecting their records."" The Justice Department could have been even more aggressive, forcing the reporters to testify and throwing them in jail had they refused, he said. Besides, federal authorities have an incentive to find out who leaked the story that goes beyond the case, he said. ""The government has to send a signal to its employees that these laws mean something, and they will investigate and prosecute you for violating them."" Whether a federal shield law would keep the Justice Department from carrying out such actions ""would totally depend on what the federal shield law looks like,"" Miller said, noting that several versions have been proposed. Some would prevent reporters from ever being subpoenaed, others would allow judges to carve out exceptions in cases of national security. White House press secretary Jay Carney reiterated on Tuesday that the administration had no involvement in any criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley predicted that the move will have little long-term impact. ""It seems to be a kind of a strange, isolated case,"" he said in a telephone interview. He predicted the Obama administration would back off rather than court further outrage.

"(CNN) -- An Alaska volcano exhibiting ""elevated seismic activity"" has spewed ash clouds skyward -- as high as 20,000 feet above sea level -- an observatory reported Wednesday. As was the case a day earlier, the Pavlof Volcano was on ""watch"" status on Wednesday because of heightened activity, and it was also under an orange code that relates to how its rumblings might affect planes flying over its summit. Both these alert levels are the second most serious out of four options, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The same alert levels also continue to apply Wednesday to the Cleveland Volcano, which like Pavlof is in the Aleutian Island range southwest of mainland Alaska. Lava was reported flowing Tuesday at Pavlof and Cleveland. ""They are very similar, and both have the ability to erupt,"" John Power, a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey, said this week. Pavlof is the higher of the two volcanoes, reaching to 8,261 feet, and the one that is connected to the Alaskan mainland. The Alaska Volcano Observatory's Wednesday update noted persisting ""elevated seismic activity"" as well as reports of steam and ash clouds. Web camera images show the plume ""rising occasionally up to about 20,000 feet above sea level,"" the same height at which a pilot on Wednesday reported a ""dark ash cloud"" stretching east-northeast. The volcano observatory also reported a ""diffuse ash plume"" on Tuesday night at an altitude of 15,000 feet and visible downwind for up to 100 miles. Five climbers killed in Philippines after deadly volcanic ash blast . Surface temperatures at the 5,676-foot high Cleveland Volcano remained elevated over the past 24 hours, the observatory said, though there were no explosions detected by infrasound data in that time. The volcano observatory continues to warn that ""sudden explosions of blocks and ash are possible with little or no warning."" The observatory said Cleveland could also produce ash clouds rising more than 20,000 feet above sea level. Beyond any impact on fish, wildlife and humans, large ash clouds could negatively impact air travel. The National Weather Service has issued a SIGMET, short for significant meteorological information, in areas around the volcanoes. After ""eruptive activity"" last year at the Cleveland Volcano, University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist Steve McNutt said 90% of air freight from Asia to Europe and North America flies over Alaska airspace, and hundreds of flights fly through Anchorage's air space daily. ""We think of the Aleutian Islands as being remote and desolate"" Power said, ""but when you come up to 30,000 feet we are talking about 20 to 30,000 people there every single day."" Power described Pavlof as ""one of the most historically active volcanoes in the Northern Hemisphere."" Cleveland is also ""very active,"" having last had a large eruption in 2001.

"(CNN) -- All-conquering rally champion Sebastien Loeb has told CNN that it is ""too late"" for him to consider a career switch to Formula One. The Frenchman, who has broken every record in the off-track motorsport in clinching a seventh consecutive world title this season, had his dreams dashed late last year when he was refused a licence to drive in F1. ""I don't think it's potential for the future,"" Loeb told World Sport's Kate Giles when asked if still had any ambitions to drive in F1. ""The story about Formula One started because Red Bull gave me the opportunity to test after my title in 2008, and everyone was very surprised that I was close to the times. ""That gave the idea to Red Bull to make me drive in a race [in 2009 for feeder team Toro Rosso], and finally at the last everything was planned to do the last race of the season and the FIA didn't give me the licence for that. Blog: Vettel win ushers in new era . ""Now I'm 36 years old and when you see some young drivers coming in, they're 20 years old, so maybe's it's a bit too late. If I have the opportunities to drive a Formula One car, for sure I will take it, but I've got no plan to do a career in that."" Loeb bounced back from that disappointment to take out his frustrations on his rally rivals this year, clinching another crown in his hometown of Haguenau early last month. ""It was really special for me. A few years ago I couldn't expect to have a rally in my hometown,"" he said. ""Now I had it this year and I finally won the rally and the championship in the same place, so for sure it was a lot of emotion and a great atmosphere, a really good rally. There were a lot of fans, my family was here and my friends, so it was really good."" Loeb has dominated the World Rally Championship with Citroen, having won a record 64 races ahead of this weekend's season-ending event in Wales, Britain. He claimed his first victory in Germany in 2002 and was then championship runner-up by just one point the following year as Citroen made a fulltime entry to the competition. So how does he maintain motivation after sweeping all behind him in the past seven years? ""My motivation is just because I like what I do. I enjoy driving, I enjoy the fight and the competition. My goal next year will be to get another title,"" Loeb said. He revealed, however, that he is getting near the end of his rally career. It's on my mind, yes, but when I don't know. I will drive next year, that's the plan. For the future, I have no idea at the moment, I will drive as long as I am motivated. And for the future I will maybe have some other plans, but not specially in Formula One.""","Sebastien Loeb confirms that he will not be trying to earn a deal in Formula One .

"(CNN) -- Bad weather is keeping Britain's Prince Harry and a team of UK veterans stranded in South Africa, their take-off point to Antarctica where they will race U.S. and Commonwealth teams on a trek to the South Pole. Swedish actor and ""True Blood"" star Alexander Skarsgard is an honorary member of the U.S. team, while Dominic West, perhaps best known for his role as McNulty in ""The Wire,"" joins veterans wounded in combat from the Commonwealth nations of Canada and Australia. The seven-person teams also include a guide and mentor. They are trekking more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) across Antarctica, in temperatures as low as -35 degrees Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit), to raise money for the charity Walking With The Wounded. The three teams left London for Cape Town on Sunday, and had been due to fly to Antarctica's Novolazarevskaya (Novo) Station on Tuesday, but a polar storm has kept them grounded. ""At the moment, they're just waiting,"" a Walking With The Wounded spokesperson told CNN. ""They're managing to do a bit of training, hiking up Table Mountain and around Cape Town."" The spokesperson said their actual departure date would not be confirmed until the weather had cleared. Once the teams arrive at Novo Station, they'll have three days of acclimatization before setting off on the trek, which is expected to take about 16 days. The teams will be pulling pulks -- or snow sleds -- containing all their food and equipment, which will weigh about 70 kilograms (154 pounds) at the start of the trip, Hunter-Dunn said. Harry is a patron of Walking With The Wounded, a cause close to the prince's heart. ""They're going to achieve something quite remarkable and in doing so will prove to everybody else that even when you've lost a leg, you've lost an arm or whatever the illness may be, that you can achieve pretty much anything if you put your mind to it,"" he said at the official departure in London last week. Despite his royal upbringing, it's the prince's role as a solider that has already won him praise from his fellow teammates and rivals. ""He's laid back, we're not scared to have him around, he's just another soldier along with the rest of us,"" says Sgt. Margaux Mange, from the U.S. team. An army helicopter pilot who has served multiple tours in Afghanistan, Harry has had plenty of training for the big race. Back in 2011, he spent time training for a Walking With The Wounded expedition to the North Pole, which saw him diving into the freezing waters of the Arctic. But he had to withdraw from that expedition early to attend the wedding of his brother. More recently, Harry traveled to Iceland for training and even spent 24 hours in an industrial freezer in preparation. But will it be enough? The winning team is expected to cross the finish line in time to have Christmas back home.","Three seven-member teams are racing to the South Pole to raise money for wounded veterans .

"New York (CNN) -- A team of experts will conduct a 60-day safety assessment of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad in the wake of the derailment that killed four people and injured dozens of others, the Federal Railroad Administration said Thursday. Known as Operation Deep Dive, the action beginning on Monday is designed to ""exhaustively review Metro-North's compliance with federal regulations, its procedures and practices, and its safety culture,"" the FRA said in a statement. A ""strike force"" of technical and human factor experts will examine everything from track, signal and ""rolling stock"" maintenance, inspection and repair practices to communication between mechanical and transportation departments at maintenance facilities to compliance with federal hours of service regulations, including fatigue management programs, according to the statement. The Hudson line train was hurtling along at 82 miles an hour, over the speed limit of 30 mph for that section of track, as it approached a sharp bend in the Bronx. The cars tumbled off the track, killing four passengers and leaving dozens more hospitalized. The lead car came to rest inches from water at the intersection of the Hudson and Harlem rivers. Jeffrey Chartier, lawyer for engineer William Rockefeller, and the engineer's s union representatives said the train's hypnotic motion may have caused Rockefeller to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed ""highway hypnosis."" The engineer told investigators that moments before the derailment he was ""going along and I'm in a daze. I don't know what happened,"" one law enforcement official said. Man vs. machine: Who should be at the wheel? National Transportation Safety Board officials have said that the train had no mechanical problems and that the tracks and signals were in proper working order. ""Safety is our top priority, and this in-depth investigation will help ensure that Metro-North is doing everything possible to improve its safety record,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the railroad, said in a statement: ""We have robust safety effort underway, including a Blue Ribbon Commission that is already studying areas that the strike force is curious about. Nevertheless, since safety is our number one priority, we're always happy to work with anyone who has constructive ideas about how to keep Metro-North's customers and employees safe."" The December 1 derailment was the fourth serious accident on the railroad since May. In June, a Metro-North train was sent down a track closed off for construction and fatally struck a foreman. In another incident, a Metro-North train derailed and was struck by a train on an adjacent track. A rail safety expert told CNN Thursday that the sweeping federal review was routine after a string of serious accidents. After the Operation Deep Dive assessment, the FRA will issue a report with findings and recommendations, the statement said. The agency will also evaluate the railroad's compliance with recent emergency order requiring ""immediate steps to ensure its train crews do not exceed speed limitations."" The order requires the railroad to ""modify its existing signal system to ensure speed limits are obeyed and to provide two qualified railroad employees to operate trains where major speed restrictions are in place until the signal system is updated.""","Feds order 60-day safety review after NYC derailment killed 4 and injured dozens .

"(CNN) -- Missile and launch components have been moved to the east coast of North Korea in the ""last few days,"" a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the information told CNN Thursday. The apparent deployment comes amid further threatening statements by North Korea and heightened tensions in the region -- a situation that ""does not need to get hotter,"" a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said. The move of the missile and launch equipment could mean that Pyongyang, which unleashed another round of scathing rhetoric accusing the United States of pushing the region to the ""brink of war,"" may be planning a missile launch soon. The components, the official said, are consistent with those of a Musudan missile, which has a 2,500-mile range, meaning it could threaten South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. The United States has been looking for a hidden North Korean east coast launch site or mobile launchers, a concern because a launch from the east coast would go over Japan, the official said. U.S. reducing rhetoric that feeds North Korean rhetoric . It is believed a missile launch would be a ""test"" launch rather than a targeted strike. That is because it appears the North Koreans have only moved the components so far. The United States is waiting to see whether North Korea issues a notice to its airmen and mariners to stay out of the region. Communication intercepts in recent days also seem to show that Pyongyang might be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks, another U.S. official said. Earlier, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told a parliamentary committee in Seoul that the North has moved a medium-range missile to its east coast for an imminent test firing or military drill. The missile doesn't appear to be aimed at the U.S. mainland, Kim said, according to the semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap. Key dates in U.S. military moves near North Korea . Wednesday, the United States announced it was sending ballistic missile defenses to Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases. North Korea has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks. The latest developments come amid the disclosure of what one U.S. official calls an Obama administration ""playbook"" of pre-scripted actions and responses to the last several weeks of North Korean rhetoric and provocations. North Korea: Our global fear and fascination . Pentagon seeks to 'turn the volume down' Pentagon officials, while decrying North Korean saber-rattling, said recent announcements of U.S. military deployments in response to belligerent statements by North Korea may have contributed to the escalating tensions between the countries. As the bombast reaches a fever pitch, the United States is refining its message toward North Korea. The Pentagon now says it is working to decrease the temperature as it maintains a frank and vigilant stance toward Pyongyang's threats. ""We are trying to turn the volume down,"" a Defense Department official said. ""We accused the North Koreans of amping things up, now we are worried we did the same thing,"" one Defense Department official said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied that there had been a change in tone and defended the U.S. responses. North Korean social media apparently hacked . ""The moves that we have been making are designed to ensure and to reassure the American people and our allies that we can defend the United States, that we will and that we can defend our allies,"" she said. It was the ratcheting of tensions from North Korea that led to the U.S. shoring up its defense posture, she said. ""But we have also been saying all the way through that this does not need to get hotter, that we can change course here"" if North Korea cooperates with the international community. At the same time, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, the United States urged North Korea's leaders ""to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations."" ""Threats and provocative actions will not bring North Korea the security, international respect, and economic development it seeks,"" she said. North Korea slams U.S. The latest tough talk from Pyongyang lashed out at the U.S. military presence in the region. A spokesman for a North Korean group accused the United States of ""hurling"" its ""nuclear war hardware into the region and pushing the situation on the brink of war,"" Pyongyang's official news agency reported. North Korean rhetoric against U.S. heats up . ""The U.S. imperialists have pursued ceaseless war moves since their occupation of South Korea, creating a touch-and-go situation several times. But never have they worked so desperately to launch a nuclear war against the DPRK with all type latest nuclear hardware involved as now,"" a spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea said in a written statement. The DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement said the United States is ""seriously mistaken if it thinks it can frighten the DPRK with such latest weapons."" It said ""the country will no longer remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. imperialists' frantic moves to ignite a nuclear war."" ""Cutting-edge weapons are not a monopoly of the U.S. and gone are the days never to return when it could invade other countries with nukes as it pleased,"" the statement said. ""The U.S. and the South Korean warmongers had better stop their rash actions, deeply aware of the gravity of the prevailing situation."" The movement of missiles . The possible movement of the North Korean missile is ""of concern, certainly to the U.S. military and to Japan,"" said Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Programme at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. He said he believes the missile in question is a Musudan, a weapon the North hasn't tested before that is based on a Soviet system. U.S. sending defensive missiles to Guam . The North has medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that the recent North Korean threats to Guam, Hawaii and the U.S. mainland have to be taken seriously. The medium-range missile will probably take about two weeks to prepare, Fitzpatrick said, which means a potential launch could coincide with the April 15 anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and grandfather of its current leader, Kim Jong Un. ""The concern we have is all you need is that one lucky shot, and that one lucky shot from a North Korean missile could do a lot of damage to our island home,"" Guam Gov. Eddie Calvo told CNN early Friday. North Korea warns 'moment of explosion' nears . The U.S. playbook . As a result of the war of words, the Obama administration established a ""playbook"" of pre-scripted actions and responses to the last several weeks of North Korean rhetoric and provocations, an administration official said Thursday. The actions included an increased show of U.S. military force during the annual U.S.-South Korea military exercise, the Foal Eagle. Some of the U.S. military's recent moves -- including the deployment of ballistic missile defenses closer to North Korea -- were not part of the planning. Key dates in U.S. military moves near North Korea . The latest situation on the Korean Peninsula stems from the North's latest long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February. Tougher U.N. sanctions in response to those moves, combined with joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises in the region, are given by Kim Jong Un's government as reasons to ratchet up its threats in recent weeks. On Thursday, North Korea barred South Korean workers and managers for a second day from entering the Kaesong industrial complex, an economic cooperation zone that sits on the North's side of the border but houses operations of scores of South Korean companies. It also repeated a threat from the weekend to completely shut down the complex, where more than 50,000 North Koreans currently work. The current crisis at Kaesong began a day after North Korea said it planned to restart ""without delay"" a reactor at its main nuclear complex that it had shut down five years ago as part of a deal with the United States, China and four other nations. Most observers say the North is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile. It has conducted three nuclear bomb tests, in 2006, 2009 and most recently in February. It has said that its nuclear weapons are a deterrent and are no longer up for negotiation. But U.S. officials have said they see no unusual military movements across the Demilitarized Zone that splits the Korean Peninsula. Many analysts say the increasingly belligerent talk is aimed at cementing the domestic authority of Kim Jong Un. Opinion: Kim Jong Un is not crazy .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Director Roman Polanski must return to the United States before the court will decide if he must go to prison for a 1977 sex conviction, a Los Angeles judge ruled Friday. Polanski's lawyer argued that evidence of misconduct by the judge and prosecutor in the case 32 years ago should be considered now, without requiring Polanski to be present. The famed director of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Pianist"" pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 but fled to Europe before he was sentenced. He has been the subject of an international extradition battle since he was arrested in Switzerland in September on a U.S. fugitive warrant. At a hearing Friday afternoon, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza also rejected a request from Polanski's victim -- Samantha Geimer, now in her 40s and a married mother of three -- to have the case dismissed. Geimer came forward long ago, saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case has been handled. ""There is no requirement that my client surrender,"" Larry Silver, Geimer's lawyer, said. ""Her suffering must come to an end."" Silver argued that ""Marsey's law,"" an initiative passed by California voters in 2008 giving crime victims certain rights, had been violated by the prosecution. Silver said Geimer was not consulted about the decision to extradite Polanski. Espinoza said the law was ""never intended in this fashion."" Polanski was 43 at the time of the conviction. Prosecutors dropped rape and other charges in exchange for the guilty plea. Polanski's attorney Chad Hummel argued that his client had already been sentenced in 1977 when the judge sent him to California's Chino prison for 45 days to be evaluated by psychologists. But Polanski fled the country before sentencing after learning the judge might not go along with the short jail term Polanski expected to get in exchange for his plea. He has been a fugitive since 1978 and lived in France before his arrest. ""Mr. Polanski did not flee from justice,"" Hummel said. ""He left because a corrupt judge was going to sentence him a second time."" In the past, Espinoza acknowledged problems with the way Polanski's case was handled, mentioning a documentary film that portrays backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he didn't send Polanski to prison. ""It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,"" Espinoza said at an earlier hearing. On Friday, Espinoza said ""nothing in the order precludes the possibility that the judge's promise will not some day be enforced."" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren argued the only just solution would be for Polanski to waive extradition and return to the United States. ""It's Mr. Polanski's decision that has delayed the proceedings of this court,"" Walgren said. ""Why will he not simply surrender to this court's jurisdiction?"" David Wells, a retired Los Angeles prosecutor, was featured in the documentary, ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired."" Although he had never been assigned to handle the Polanski case, Wells said he goaded the judge. He later recanted during an interview with CNN, saying he had inflated his importance in the celebrity case because he didn't think the documentary would be shown in the United States. It was broadcast in 2008 on HBO, which, like CNN, is part of Time Warner. For years, Polanski, 76, and various lawyers have made quiet overtures to resolve the case, but negotiations have always gotten bogged down over prosecutors' insistence that he return to the United States and appear in a Los Angeles courtroom. Swiss authorities released the director from jail on $4.5 million bail in early December ""pending extradition"" to the United States.","Director pleaded guilty to sex with teen in 1977 but left country before sentencing .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Amid the swirl of claims and counter-claims involving sex, lies, and witness videotapes, one of the most intriguing aspects of Bo Xilai's so-called ""trial of the century"" in China has been the live micro-blogging of proceedings from the courthouse. Timeline: Bo's fall from grace . Case updates, photos, excerpts of video testimony and partial transcripts were posted on the court's Twitter-like Sina Weibo account during the course of the five-day trial of the former high-flying politician on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, attracting more than 590,000 followers. State media rushed to herald the micro-blog as a reflection of ""historic transparency"" and ""historic progress for the rule of law"" in a country that regularly clamps down on the free flow of information and dissent. But while the court's micro-blog offered unprecedented glimpses into what was widely viewed as a tightly-orchestrated show trial, the flow of information was nonetheless a selective drip-feed that sparked questions about its objectivity. Five things not to have missed . Some Sina Weibo users complained of deleted comments that went against the party line of the trial's fairness and the certainty of Bo's guilt. Speculation -- in mainstream as well as social media -- about what lay beyond the micro-blog and what was excluded from the transcripts underscored the lack of openness the party claimed to offer. People with detailed knowledge of the court proceedings told CNN that the micro-blog left out details that may have placed Bo in a good light and Bo's claims of threats made against him and his family during party investigations. And while criminal trials in China are theoretically open to the public, in practice, the gallery is as open as the state wants it to be. Bo's trial lacked independent observers -- Bo's family, government officials, and a handful of pre-approved journalists were allowed into the courtroom -- while foreign media were relegated to a hotel across the street. ""For that class of trial, the Bo Xilai trial was a showcase for how to be more transparent about what goes on inside the courthouse,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong-Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, comparing it to the information vacuum during the brief, closed trials of Bo's wife and his former right-hand man Wang Lijun last year. ""But that's not real transparency; it's selective transparency,"" Bequelin added. ""The party remains in charge of what gets said to the public."" Joshua Rosenzweig, another Chinese human rights researcher based in Hong Kong, agreed there was a relatively high amount of information released compared to the vast majority of Chinese criminal trials, but he questioned the motives behind it. ""One motivation is to control the narrative. Part of what spawns rumors online is the lack of transparency,"" he said. ""When you try to take control of the release of information, it draws people into the information and doesn't give as much opportunity for straying from that narrative."" Concurrently, the trial comes against a heightened crackdown on activism under President Xi Jinping -- with regular arrests of micro-blog users for ""rumor mongering"" and activists for ""assembling a crowd to disrupt order in a public place."" Over the past several months, state media has reported the arrests of numerous journalists and ordinary citizens across China for ""fabricating online rumors"" on their Weibo accounts. On Friday, prominent human rights advocate Xu Zhiyong was formally arrested for disturbing public order after he was detained last month. The same day, Charles Xue, a major liberal activist with more than 12 million followers on Sina Weibo, was detained by Beijing police on prostitution charges, prompting online speculation that Xue was the victim of a set-up. Read more: China's netizens not always on side of justice . The crackdown on dissent is a similar attempt to manage public opinion by setting boundaries around key opinion-makers with large followings on micro-blogging platforms, Rosenzweig said. Bequelin said the arrests reflect how the Xi administration is ""very conservative on political matters. Their rationale is that China is going through a turbulent period and they need to make some structural adjustments to the economy, civil services, all the acute problems that the system is facing. Therefore, they cannot to afford to have anything destabilize the country."" For all the party's efforts to create an impression of fairness and transparency in the Bo trial, analysts interpreted them as one-off gestures tailored for a high-profile case. ""This was a sensitive case because it revealed so much of the inner workings of the party and the abuses of power and the elite, so it needed a trial that was a match for that,"" Bequelin said, calling the proceedings a ""good-quality show trial."" ""But in no way does it indicate a systemic shift in China toward greater standards in the administration of justice,"" he added. Rosenzweig agreed. ""It's far too early to see this as a transformative event that will trickle down into criminal proceedings,"" he said. At the same time, human rights analysts believe the theatrics will have the unintended effect of raising public expectations of a fair trial in China. ""At the end of the day, Chinese criminal trials are primarily about reasserting social and political order over society, not providing a process that pays considered attention to the rights of defendants,"" Rosenzweig said. ""The Chinese public is desirous of a criminal process that is more rights-based. So seeing this in practice in such a spectacular form, while it might be a one-off, does set a precedent in people's memories of what a criminal trial can look like."" In China, the role of a judge is not to determine guilt, but rather to decide on a sentence based on information provided by the prosecution. The role of the defense is extremely limited, and criminal cases tend to be open-and-shut, with a conviction rate of 99.9%. While Bo's long and fiery rebuttal of the charges against him is unlikely to alter what is an all-but-certain guilty verdict, the fact that he defended himself at all is highly unusual in the Chinese criminal system. It is precisely this tension between a party bent on preserving its power and the public's push for greater rights that will fuel the development of the rule of law in the China, according to analysts. ""Twenty years ago, [the party] didn't need to go through all this,"" Bequelin said. ""But now, if you want to give the citizenry the impression that someone got a fair trial, the bar is much higher.""

"(CNN) -- After 50 years, a seismic shift is taking place in the international drug policy debate, both at the level of individual countries and also at the U.N. On December 10, Uruguay's Senate passed a law making it the first country in the world to legally regulate marijuana. This is hugely significant as it is the first time a country has officially broken with the international prohibitionist approach. In so doing, Uruguay will establish a legal recreational cannabis market by regulating production through to sale. This goes far beyond decriminalization or de facto toleration as witnessed in the Netherlands and a few other states. Meanwhile, at the United Nations, the international community appears headed for a ""drug war"" showdown. News broke recently of deadlock and fevered debates on drug policy at the U.N. as the organization tries to agree an international strategic outline for the coming years. For many, who have witnessed decades of failure of global drugs policy, the key question is why these developments have taken so long. This question was addressed in an LSE IDEAS report, ""Governing the Global Drug Wars,"" which I recently edited. Since 1961, governments have been held in check by an apparent international consensus on criminal justice-oriented approaches to drugs. The trajectory of policy has been toward greater repression and more coercive policies. And, led by the United States, the war on drugs became militarized at the global level from the 1970s. Breakaway countries that tried new policies, such as decriminalization and public health models, were roundly criticized by other states and the U.N. system itself. This forced countries willing to experiment into a defensive posture. Some proceeded with alternative policies such as de facto regulated markets (even though the laws remained unchanged). But in the past few years the global drugs consensus has unraveled. No longer do nations of the world talk about the unobtainable goal of ""a drug-free world."" Instead, a more multifaceted dialogue is now under way. On the one side remain the unreconstructed drug warriors, led by Russia, China and an obscure international institution known as the International Narcotics Control Board. On the other side is an emerging coalition of Latin American nations, including Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico, calling for a systemic rethink. They have been joined by other world leaders, ranging from former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to former Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss. In the middle are European states. On the one hand they lead the way on relatively innovative health-based policies of harm reduction while, on the other, they pursue more minimalist variants of the global drug war. A common thread for European policy has thus far been an unwillingness to assume any major leadership at the international level. Add to this middle ground the previous drug war proselytizer and advocate, the United States. Coming to terms with the impacts of its drug war at home, Washington has ceased advocating it as militantly abroad. This factor, perhaps above all else, has provided space for alternative discussions to gain prominence at the U.N. Leaked documents from a key U.N. drugs strategy meeting this month underscored that global drugs policy is at a major crossroads. Drug war advocates can no longer paper over very real divisions in strategic goals and tactical means. Many Latin America states are refusing a continued acceptance of the black market violence that accompanies a global illicit commodity market. And Uruguay is a clear example of this desire for change. It has pursued marijuana regulation as an innovative way to tackle criminality and gangs. Meanwhile, some European countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands are no longer willing to overlook the glaring successes of their harm reduction policies out of deference to drug war rhetoric. And the United States has ceased expending political capital on this issue and is looking to set a new course. The massive opportunities here should not be underestimated. A militarized and enforcement-led war on drugs is an illogical approach to what is essentially a public health issue. Policies based on public health principles of treatment and harm reduction provide the only clear successes in international drug policy over the last few decades. As states look to consolidate these gains, having effective international institutions which can support, rather than undermine, these policies will be a tremendous boon in the battle against HIV, Hepatitis C and addiction in general. Meanwhile, the move towards an ""impact reduction"" rather than a supply reduction paradigm in producer and transit countries seems the most hopeful way to reduce the appalling levels of violence that has been displaced to these countries by rich world consumer countries. As we witness the beginning of the end of the current prohibitionist strategy, no longer it seems will evidence-based policy always and inevitably be overruled by ideology and politicization. With the breakdown of the one-size-fits-all approach, a move towards policy multipolarity is the best step forward towards improved international management of this crucial issue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Collins.","Uruguayan lawmakers vote to legalize marijuana .

"Vienna, Austria (CNN) -- If anyone can understand what the Cleveland abduction victims must have endured, it's Natasha Kampusch. Like the three women, the 25-year-old Austrian spent most of a decade imprisoned in her abductor's house after being abducted on a Vienna street in 1998. Wolfgang Priklopil kept her locked in his cellar for eight tortuous years. He raped her, then committed suicide when she finally escaped seven years ago. She said Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight should enjoy the feeling of freedom but be careful. ""It was an enormous feeling of joy that cannot be compared to anything else,"" she told CNN. ""You see all of the possibilities laid out in front of you. ... ""The women in Cleveland should really try to savor this joyous feeling as long as possible, and to avoid letting themselves be pushed back into everyday life too soon."" In 1998, Kampusch, then 10, was dragged into a car while walking to school. She was often locked inside a ""hermetically sealed"" concrete jail. Her abductor used restraints on her to keep her in bed with him as he slept. She wrote that she was beaten as many as 200 times a week -- until she heard her own spine ""snap."" She escaped in August 2006 and wrote a book entitled ""3,096 Days"" about the ordeal. The days immediately after her escape were hard. ""It was a very difficult time to experience for me, the media everywhere, and re-establishing my relationship with my parents again,"" she said. In many ways the case in Cleveland is a lot like hers, but she was alone, while the three Ohio women had each other to talk to during their captivity. She also never heard her abductor explain why he did it, but she said that wasn't as important as knowing he would never be able to harm anyone else. She said she was glad the women were still alive. ""I am very happy for the three women, and thank God they had survived their ordeal,"" she said. ""They are certainly very strong women."" Kampusch said former captives need to take time to work through the emotional issues themselves. ""Don't let other people take over,"" she said, standing outside the home where she was held. She owns it now; it was awarded to her by the Austrian courts as damages. The property is an important symbol, she said, and keeping it is her way of dealing with her past. ""It's so very emotional for me because it never stops,"" she said. ""You live with it."" The ordeal will be with her for her whole life, she said. She tries to see positives in her life and look forward, not back. She had to ""bury the hate you feel for the person who did this to you,"" she said. Besides assimilating back into normal lives slowly, former captives also have to deal with the people who don't believe their stories are entirely true. She would tell the Cleveland women: ""Don't worry what people say. They are the ones that experienced it, they are the ones who survived it, and they are the ones who have to come to terms with what they experienced their entire lives."" It's a sobering message for women already scarred by years of terrible conditions. Their captivity has ended, but their ordeal may be far from over. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Vienna, and Steve Almasy wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Victoria Eastwood contributed to this report.","Natasha Kampusch was held for eight years in an Austrian man's basement .

"(CNN) -- A decision by world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking not to attend a conference in Israel in support of an academic boycott of the country has sparked controversy in Israel and a vitriolic debate online. Hawking, who's a professor at Britain's Cambridge University, had initially accepted an invitation to the high-profile Israeli Presidential Conference, taking place in Jerusalem in June. His change of heart this week appears to be the result of pressure from Palestinian academics to abide by a boycott set up in protest over Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. ""A letter was sent on Friday to the Israeli president's office from Stephen Hawking regarding his decision not to attend the Presidential Conference, based on advice from Palestinian academics that he should respect the boycott,"" a Cambridge University spokesman told CNN on Thursday. Hawking is also unable currently to fly for health reasons, the spokesman said. Cambridge University initially said Hawking's poor health was the reason he was no longer attending, according to local media reports. Hawking, who is quadriplegic as a result of an incurable degenerative disease, has had repeated health problems. Hawking's letter said he had first accepted the invitation ""to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement but also because it would allow me to lecture on the West Bank,"" the conference organizers said. His decision to boycott the conference, hosted by Israeli President Shimon Peres, a Nobel peace laureate, has prompted a ""Twitterstorm."" Some tweeters accuse him of anti-Semitism or comment on his physical disabilities, while others applaud his support for the Palestinian academics. One tweeter, Ali Abunimah, observes: ""Amazing how many Israelis on Facebook want Stephen Hawking dead, electrocuted or made to suffer in other nasty ways."" Haaretz writer Chemi Shalev, who describes himself as a ""political junkie, proud father, concerned Israeli, veteran journalist,"" tweets: ""My take: Stephen #Hawking is now the academic boycott movement's unlikely poster boy."" 'Outrageous and improper' Israel Maimon, chairman of the Presidential Conference, said Hawking's decision to pull out of the event was wrong. ""The academic boycott against Israel is in our view outrageous and improper, certainly for someone for whom the spirit of liberty lies at the basis of his human and academic mission,"" he said in a statement. ""Israel is a democracy in which all individuals are free to express their opinions, whatever they may be. The imposition of a boycott is incompatible with open, democratic dialogue."" Some 5,000 people from around the world are expected to attend, Maimon said, to hear speakers who include global technology company executives, academics, Nobel laureates, artists and past and present world leaders. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Soviet-era President Mikhail Gorbachev and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair are all expected to attend, he added. Hawking, who's also a cosmologist, astronomer and mathematician, is the author of books including the best-seller, ""A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes."" The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement was established in 2005 by Palestinian civil society groups, which called for international groups and ""people of conscience"" to boycott or put pressure on Israel ""until it complies with international law and Palestinian rights."" Omar Barghouti, one of the founding members of the movement, told CNN: ""Stephen Hawking is the most prominent academic today to respect the Palestinian boycott guidelines and to refuse to visit Israel. This reminds us of the moral weight of academics in the boycott of apartheid of South Africa."" He said Hawking had been convinced by the ""unanimous Palestinian voice"" he heard from his contacts within the Palestinian community. ""There is deep appreciation among the Palestinians for Professor Hawking's respecting the boycott, and we sincerely hope that we convince many hesitant academics to follow suit and to shoulder a moral responsibility of boycotting Israel until it complies with international law,"" Barghouti said. The Jerusalem Post reports that Hawking has visited Israel four times, most recently in 2006, when he lectured at Israeli and Palestinian universities. West Bank housing . Israel's government gave initial approval Wednesday to plans to build 296 housing units in the settlement of Bethel, near the West Bank city of Ramallah. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas strongly condemned the decision, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said Thursday. Presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina, in a media statement quoted by WAFA, said the Israeli move would sabotage the peace process and efforts made by the U.S. administration to move it forward. A U.N. Human Rights Council report in January said Israeli settlements had taken a ""heavy toll"" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians. It outlined the consistent violation of Palestinians' rights in what it called a ""creeping annexation"" by Israel in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Palestinians welcomed the report's findings, but Israel, which considers the Human Right Council to be biased, said the report would hurt the peace process. There are about 250 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the report said, all started since Israel seized the lands after the Six Day War in 1967. Israel's consistently growing presence in East Jerusalem and the West Bank has caused great tension between Israel and the Arab world, including Palestinians. Israel says its presence is needed for security.

"(CNN) -- A Mississippi teenager faces 27 years in prison after running over and killing a man walking along a rural highway in a case the victim's family called a hate crime. Matthew Darby, 18, pleaded guilty earlier this week to manslaughter in the July 2012 death of 61-year-old Johnny Lee Butts. Companions put Darby at the wheel of the white Chevrolet that hit Butts from behind on a highway in Panola County, about 150 miles north of Jackson. Butts was black. Two teens who were in the car the morning Butts was killed said they and Darby -- all white -- had been drinking vodka and smoking marijuana all night. The Monte Carlo hit Butts with such force that the windshield collapsed into the car, bending the steering wheel back sharply. His leg was nearly severed, and his body was found more than 170 feet from where he was struck, according to court records. Investigators estimate the vehicle was traveling somewhere between 55 and 70 mph. Butts' family told CNN they believed their father was killed because he was black and questioned why the murder charge against Darby didn't reflect that. Darby's lawyer, Tony Farese, told reporters earlier this week that the death was no hate crime, but ""a tragic situation by young people who were intoxicated."" Butts' family met with Darby in jail for three hours last week, their lawyer, Wilbur Colom, said Thursday. Colom said the teen was extremely remorseful and asked for forgiveness but never admitted anything about a hate crime. ""In the end, we were not convinced it wasn't a hate crime,"" Colom said. ""But in the end, we were also not convinced we would get anything more desirable than 27 years."" Darby also pleaded guilty to a separate burglary count in a deal with prosecutors that a judge approved on Monday. He was sentenced to 20 years on the manslaughter charge and an additional, consecutive seven years for burglary, the district attorney's office told CNN. CNN's Scott Bronstein contributed to this report.","Matthew Darby pleads guilty to manslaughter and burglary .

"Washington (CNN) -- In rare bipartisan accord, normally quarrelsome U.S. lawmakers passed a measure designed to end budget-related air traffic controller furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays. The House of Representatives approved the legislation, capping a major congressional initiative as delays snarled traffic at airports. The House vote comes a day after unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate. The measure -- which is expected to be signed into law by President Obama -- gives the Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts. It would also allow authorities to protect 149 control towers at small- and medium-sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons. ""Good news for America's traveling public,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said a day before the House vote. ""But ultimately, this is no more than a temporary Band-Aid that fails to address the overarching threat to our economy posed by the sequester's mindless across the board cuts."" Furloughs affecting some 15,000 Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers began this week with the agency saying it had no flexibility to avert them without action by Congress. Under the sweeping austerity triggered by congressional inaction on deficit reduction, the FAA was required to cut $600 million from its budget. The furloughs have delayed more than 3,000 flights since Sunday, according to FAA tallies. By comparison, there were more than 4,400 delays due to weather and other factors, the agency said. Controller furloughs and the planned closure of towers that are privately run but overseen by federal aviation regulators have become political flash points in the partisan-fueled debate over spending in Washington. They have been highlighted by many to illustrate a clear nationwide consequence of the $85 billion in government-wide cuts that took effect in March and may otherwise not be apparent to the public. Vocal and politically powerful aviation interests have argued that the budget cuts affecting their industry would hurt business, travelers and cost jobs. More than 600 million people fly U.S. airlines each year, figures show. During the furloughs, controllers have been spacing planes farther apart at key centers so they can manage traffic with current staffing, the FAA said. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said she worried that continued FAA furloughs could jeopardize jobs throughout the travel and hospitality industry. Earlier this spring, Congress approved a stop-gap budget law that would, among other things, ease budget cuts for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and Veterans Affairs. The deal moved quickly through the Senate. ""Something rare has happened in Washington; the Senate came together on a bipartisan basis to put common sense before politics,"" Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas said Thursday.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Speculation has been rife about the future of the Spyker Formula 1 team for some time. First there were the financial struggles at Spyker Cars, the luxury automobile manufacturer that gave the team its name. Spyker Cars took out a $4 million loan to keep afloat, using the ""Spyker"" name as collateral. Even if Spyker Cars sells its entire stake in the team, FIA rules state that the team must retain the Spyker F1 name . Then there was the surprise sacking of the Dutch driver, Christijan Albers after he had failed to bring in promised sponsorship revenue. What was most surprising about this was that Albers was widely assumed to be the person who brought the Spyker name -- and money -- to the team. His father in law, Roel Koojiman, is a wealthy Dutch financier and Albers was close to Michiel Mol, the team's owner. Last week Spyker Cars announced that it was to sell some or all of its stake in Spyker Formula 1. Immediately Spyker Formula 1 responded with a press release intended to quash speculation that the team would not be able to finish the 2007 season. Speaking exclusively to CNN, team principal Collin Kolles hinted that a rescue deal is in place: ""Actually it's too early to talk about it. The only thing I can say is that we will be racing in Formula 1 in the future."" One potential problem is that FIA rules mean that a team cannot change its name mid-season. In September 2006, when Spyker bought the Midland F1 Racing team, it used the Spyker name as a headline sponsor: ""Spyker MF1 Racing"". This year it was allowed to change the team's name to ""Spyker Formula 1"" but it may have to retain the Spyker name. ""That's for sure,"" continues Kolles, ""you even cannot change name more than once in five years without agreement from the other teams. It's speculation, the name might change, but it might not -- even with different ownership."" Midland F1 had only raced for eleven grands prix before Spyker's takeover. In 2005 it had raced under the ""Jordan"" name after having bought the Jordan team the previous year. So the team has already had three names in as many years. Further complicating Spyker's difficult year is its legal challenge against Scuderia Toro Rosso and Super Aguri. Spyker maintains that these teams are merely B-teams racing cars that are barely-disguised versions of the outgoing cars of their parent teams (Red Bull Racing and Honda, respectively). Spyker's contention is that, as an independent constructor, it has to pay for its own chassis development, its own wind-tunnel testing and so on. This situation is to deepen next year, when FIA regulations will allow new customer teams to join the grid. One of these is expected to be Prodrive, who many speculate will be driving McLaren MP4-22s (this year's McLaren F1 car) in the 2008 season. Kolles believes these new teams -- along with Toro Rosso and Super Aguri -- should be treated differently to the genuine constructors' teams. ""We have a clear line on this,"" says Kolles, ""first of all arbitration will continue. We made a verbal agreement after the British Grand Prix. We don't have it in written form yet. Until we have agreement we believe customer cars cannot be equally regarded as constructors' cars. And that's our position, and not only our position but the position of basically all the other teams."" Looking to the future, Kolles is bullish and points to the team's past success as Jordan: ""The team is still the fifth most successful team in the current Formula 1 era. It's more successful than Toyota or Honda. We have shown -- as in Monte Carlo in the free practice -- if it's raining we are competitive and the team works very well in moments where you have to make quick decisions.""

"(CNN) -- Texas on Friday became the latest state to sue BP, Halliburton and others tied to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, alleging the parties ""engaged in willful and wanton misconduct"" and seeking penalties and damages ""to the fullest extent allowed by law."" The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Beaumont, more than three years after one of the worst oil spills in American history. Listed defendants include Transocean, Halliburton and Anadarko, in addition to BP America. Texas is not the first state to file such a lawsuit. Florida, for instance, did so last month, joining several other Gulf states. The Texas Attorney General's office, in a news release Friday, said the state expects ""its case to be consolidated"" with others -- all of them intent on recouping ""damages associated with harm caused to the Gulf."" The Texas lawsuit asks for money from BP and other parties for a host of reasons. They include sales and hotel occupancy taxes that the state didn't receive, it contends, because visitors and others didn't go to its Gulf Coast communities due to the spill, as well as ""lost"" revenue for state park entrance and concession fees. The lawsuit also asks for civil penalties for every barrel as well as every day that oil was discharged into the Gulf. The disaster began with a rig explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers. It took nearly three months to stop the gushing oil, which was done by placing a cap on the well nearly a mile beneath the water's surface. By then, though, the discharge had already caused major environmental damage, not to mention significantly affecting Gulf Coast economies. The spill damaged coral reef formations, according to researchers. Scientists have previously confirmed that a plume of hydrocarbons from the well settled in the deep Gulf. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said about 59,200 barrels of oil a day flowed from the well. In November, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that BP will plead guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the explosion and the spill. It agreed to pay $4.5 billion in government penalties. A month later, a federal judge signed off on BP's settlement with businesses and people hard hit by the spill. Thousands of businesses and individuals made claims in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, some coastal counties in eastern Texas and western Florida and adjacent Gulf waters and bays. BP estimated a settlement of about $7.8 billion paid from a $20 billion trust. With the exception of seafood claims, there is no cap on the amount BP will pay to those who agree to the settlement. But that didn't fully settle the incident, as a number of states continue to press for damages. Texas, for one, doesn't specify in its lawsuit how much money it is seeking. Tom Kelley, a spokesman for that state's attorney general, said there is no estimate as to how much the state is seeking -- or might receive -- adding ""any damage amounts in this case would be determined by a jury verdict or final settlement.""

"(CNN) -- When officers arrived at Ariel Castro's home in Cleveland, a crowd had formed on the porch. But where was the woman they came for? Where was Amanda Berry? Then she stepped forward, holding a crying child. It was really her, the missing girl they had searched for for 10 years. It is Amanda Berry, Officer Michael Tracy said. ""Just the emotion at that point of my partner confirming that it was Amanda ... It was overwhelming,"" Officer Anthony Espada recalled. Source: Michelle Knight was Cleveland suspect's main 'punching bag' Cleveland police this week released the emotional video interviews of officers Espada, Tracy and Barbara Johnson, who helped in the May 6 rescue of the three women from Castro's home. The 11-minute video, which is posted on YouTube, provides the most graphic detail to date of the harrowing rescue. It's also a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse at the raw emotions of officers involved in the ordeal. Once they had Berry, they wondered who else was in Castro's home. Was the suspect in there? They asked Amanda, as the child continued to wail. ""She says yes, Gina DeJesus and another girl,"" Espada said. ""It was like another bombshell with overwhelming force hit me. We immediately started running toward the house."" When they entered the home, it almost seemed peaceful, Espada recalled. As if nobody else was there. Nobody was in the basement. Nobody was downstairs. How the abductions happened . And then they heard the sound of scurrying feet upstairs. ""It was Michelle (Knight). She kind of popped out into the doorway,"" Espada said, his voice cracking with emotion. ""She came charging. She was like. 'You saved us. You saved us.' And I am holding on to her so tight. And within a few seconds, I see another girl come out of the bedroom."" He immediately recognized the girl, Espada said, probably from missing posters that date to 2004. But she looked thinner than he remembered. He asked the girl to say her name. She said her name was Georgina DeJesus, he recalled. ""It was very overwhelming,"" Espada said. ""It took everything to hold myself together."" Inside Cleveland's haunted house . One of the women also jumped into Johnson's arms, screaming at the female officer. ""She was saying 'please don't let me go. Please don't let me go,'"" Johnson said. ""I said, 'Honey don't worry, I am not going to let you go."" Johnson said Espada stared at her with an unreadable expression. We found them, Espada said. ""I can't even explain the emotions we felt,"" Johnson said. ""It was just unbelievable. It was surreal. The heaviness in the heart just lifted."" Castro, 52, was arrested quickly after that. He is in jail on charges of kidnapping and rape, and is accused of snatching the three women between 2002 to 2004, and holding them ever since. His attorney has said he plans to plead not guilty.","The first officers to arrive at the house speak about the emotional rescue .

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- A judge is considering a jury recommendation that a former University of Virginia lacrosse player be sentenced up to 26 years in prison for his role in the death of his ex-girlfriend. A jury returned the recommendation late Wednesday, hours after finding George Huguely, 24, guilty of second-degree murder and grand larceny in the May 2010 death of Yeardley Love. The case captured national attention with a spotlight shown on the volatile relationship of star athletes Huguely and 22-year-old Love, who both played lacrosse for the university's nationally-ranked teams. Judge Edward Hogshire is expected to schedule Huguely's sentencing date on April 16, at which time he can accept or reduce the jury's recommendation. Outside the courtroom, Charlottesville Commonwealth's Attorney Warner D. Chapman told reporters that ""what we do in court is a very rough approximation of justice in any given case. ""There's nothing that we can say that will make good the terrible and tragic loss to the Love family,"" Chapman said. ""There are no winners in this case. There is nothing but loss everywhere."" He did not take any questions, saying he would wait until after sentencing to comment further. Huguely's attorney, Francis Lawrence, said he was disappointed in the verdict, saying his client displayed ""amazing resilience and courage."" ""He's hopeful. He's spiritual,"" he said in brief comments following the verdict. ""And we look forward to some corrections on what happened here tonight."" It was unclear whether Lawrence planned to appeal the verdict. The jury did not agree with the prosecution that Huguely was guilty of first-degree murder, and it acquitted him on several other charges, including robbery, and breaking and entering to commit larceny. Huguely has never denied he was in Love's apartment nor that they had a fight. At the center of the case were dueling portraits of Huguely, who prosecutors contend killed Love in a jealous rage while the defense argued the death was accidental. Prosecutors claimed Huguely followed through with a threat to kill Love after accusing her of allegedly having a liaison with a lacrosse player from a competing university. ""I should have killed you,"" he wrote in an e-mail to Love, which was read during the trial. But the defense argued that Huguely contributed to her death but had no intention of killing her. Lawrence described his client as ""stupid, drunk -- but not calculating."" Police were initially called to Love's off-campus Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported a possible alcohol overdose, authorities said at the time. A medical examiner found Love died of blunt force trauma to the head. The prosecution told jurors that Love's death was slow and painful, claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. Inside an emotionally-charged courtroom, Huguely hung his head and appeared to cry during his attorney's plea during the sentencing phase that directly followed the jury's verdict. ""George's decision and judgment were clouded by drinking, immaturity,"" attorney Rhonda Quagliana told the jurors. ""It's not an excuse. It's not a justification. It's just a fact ... (at the time) George is a 22-year-old immersed in sex and alcohol."" Love's mother, Sharon, and sister, Alexis, both cried during their testimony in the sentencing phase, which saw two female jurors cry. ""Every year that goes by, I'm afraid I'm forgetting a little piece of her,"" Sharon Love told the court. Alexis Love told the jurors that not a day goes by that she doesn't think about what happened to her sister. ""First, there's the shock. And then that wears off, and it becomes reality,"" she said. ""...I've never wanted anything so much in life as I've wanted to see her face again.""

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund rained on Real Madrid's parade in midweek, and the German soccer champions overcame snowy conditions to kickstart their domestic title hopes on Saturday. Dortmund's hopes of a third successive Bundesliga crown seem slim, even at this early stage of the season, but the 2-0 win at Freiburg kept Jurgen Klopp's team in fourth place after nine matches -- albeit nine points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich. While last season's championship was somewhat offset by disappointing results in Europe, Wednesday's 2-1 victory against nine-time winners Real put Dortmund in pole position to qualify for the knockout stage of the Champions League from Group D. That momentum was maintained despite a difficult start at the MAGE Solar Stadion, where the pitch was covered in powdery snow after a cold snap hit Northern Europe. Second-half goals from Serbia defender Neven Subotic and young playmaker Mario Gotze were enough to quell the home side's spirited opening onslaught, which almost produced a goal when Lukasz Piszczek headed against his own post. Subotic glanced in a header nine minutes after the break and the 20-year-old Gotze sealed victory on 83 to leave Freiburg in midtable. It was Dortmund's second win in the last six league games, having lost at home to Schalke last weekend. ""It was an incredibly tough game,"" Klopp told reporters. ""You could see in the first half just how hard it was to play on a pitch like that. ""In the second half, we played better than Freiburg did in the first, so this wasn't an undeserved win, but in these conditions anything could have happened."" Schalke, who beat English club Arsenal in the Champions League in midweek, moved up to second place with a 1-0 win at home to Nuremberg. A 77th-minute goal from winger Jefferson Farfan put the Royal Blues within four points of Bayern, who host Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday. Wolfsburg, who sacked coach Felix Magath on Thursday, moved off the bottom of the table with a 4-1 win over 10-man Fortuna Dusseldorf. Dutch striker Bas Dost netted twice, while former Bayern forward Ivioca Olic also netted and Brazilian midfielder Diego added a 78th-minute penalty after Oliver Fink was sent off for fouling him. Mainz moved up to fifth place as Hungary striker Adam Szalai scored all the goals in a 3-0 win at home to Hoffenheim. Mid-table Werder Bremen came from behind to draw 1-1 at promoted team Greuther Furth, who dropped to the bottom on goal difference below Augsburg -- beaten 2-0 by Hamburg on Friday.","Borussia Dortmund fourth in German Bundesliga after beating Freiburg 2-0 .

"(CNN) -- ""If you build it, they will come."" A very overused, but very apt quote for my take on Sochi following my first visit to the Russian host city of next year's Winter Olympics. The Sochi 2014 organizers have taken Kevin Costner's Field of Dreams quote literally, except their film has a soundtrack of constant drilling, banging, and the grinding of rocks. Russian rubble . The Black Sea resort seems a million miles from the one I'd read about. More the Russian Rubble Field than the Russian Riviera. I've never seen so much construction on such a large scale in one place. Hundreds of workers in orange bibs working in shifts on construction sites 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They're building roads, train lines, hotels, promenades, and harbors in the coastal Olympic Park area -- and in the mountain location in Krasnaya Polyana as well, which is 40 kilometers inland. As one local driver put it: ""they build and build. There is no end to it. And then -- where is what they build?"" CNN's Aiming for Gold team spent five days in Sochi, after which it's difficult not to have some sympathy with him. Traffic trouble . Every journey we took, the road layout changed around the construction. A journey from the hotel to Sochi took 45 minutes one way but took double on the way back after we were caught out by another diversion. The disruption to the lives of Sochi's residents is immense. It's dangerous to walk along many of the (alleged) roads, for danger of falling down an uncovered man hole. From inside my hotel room you couldn't fail to hear the nine nearby cranes going about their business night and day and leaving a thick layer of dust covering everything in sight. But this is all a means to an end -- an end which is just five months away. It's the biggest international sporting event to ever come to the region and many of the locals are acutely aware of its significance. Watching world . One lady told us: ""it's a great thing that such a big thing will happen right in our yard. All these sportsmen will come -- the whole world will be here -- can you believe it?"" The importance isn't lost on the organizers either. If it is the daily 1am progress report with the government is guaranteed to see to that. And in their mind there's no doubt things won't be ready. The man in charge Dmitry Chernyshenko told me that the Olympics would be ""one of the brightest moments in the history of modern Russia."" They're aiming to shatter stereotypes but says: ""we're not over confident, we're just delivering what we promised in accordance with our commitment."" On track . Although the Sochi airport upgrade has been completed we still had to wait over an hour for our bags at the carousel after our flight from Moscow. The brand new train line to link the coastal area with the mountains is still under construction -- as are a large number of the roads. However the buildings for the two athletes villages are in place. The 508 room hotel and Congress Center -- complete with three swimming pools, tennis court & spa, which will house the International Olympic Committee -- is finished. Twenty thousand new hotel rooms have been guaranteed, but the U.S. team planning representatives who we bumped into said they've been told five of the promised hotels will now not materialize. The many areas which looked like chaos to my untrained eye have been described by the organizing committee as simply requiring finishing touches. Ready for action . Across the building sites, pavements were emerging, walkways were being flattened, trees were being planted. Perhaps no surprise with 70,000 workers on the job. In terms of the sporting venues, there's no denying it seems they could host the Games tomorrow. All 10 of them have been newly built -- and they don't just look great, they've all successfully held a number of high profile test events already. The pre-Games test program has included more than 70 events in all Olympic and Paralympic sports -- with the press briefing notes proudly declaring their program has been three times bigger than the one in Vancouver four years ago. They're not tinpot events either. They have included the speed skating world championships, the FIS Alpine skiing European Cup and 12 World Cup stages. From our tour of the venues, it appears that the early preparation seems to have paid off. There was a medal podium, flags, a full ice rink and even pot plants inside the Adler arena, home to the speed skating events. Late decision . The tall structures and semi-permanent marquees were going up on the concourse of the Bolshoi Ice Dome. The only coastal venue with major construction still ongoing is the stadium for the opening & closing ceremony -- largely as a result of the late decision to build a roof. As manager of the Adler Arena Dmitry Grigoriev said: ""We can only put our feet up when the Games end and the last athletes leave the village, but we are as ready as we can be."" Up in the mountains, it's the same story. The Rosa Khutor alpine center, Sanki sliding center and Laura cross country and biathlon center have all held test events of their own with the structures firmly in place. However it doesn't take a genius to realize there's one vital ingredient missing from these venues. The white stuff. Much has been made of the madness of hosting a Winter Olympics at a seaside resort. Admittedly it's only September -- but our cameraman Andrew Waller had no problems filming at the highest point (2,300m) in just a t-shirt. Last February did organizers no favors either. It was the warmest on record, with some of the alpine test events canceled due to rain. Snow fears . It's for this reason Sochi has undertaken the biggest snow storage operation ever. They've got nine epic aluminum covered snow slugs resting on the rocky mountainsides, like something from an alien occupied lunar landscape. It's what's been stored from last winter -- just in case. Snow making equipment has also been installed on the mountains. Just in case. The team are resolute that they won't need it. We met the man in charge who hails from Finland -- Mikko Martikainen aka Mr Snow -- halfway up the mountain. He certainly doesn't look like he's having sleepless nights over it. ""I'm not worried at all,"" he said. ""I'm very confident. We guarantee we will have snow. There might be a lack of snow, but there may be too much snow. We are prepared for both scenarios."" It's a good bet that the sun is set to shine on Sochi once again come February. But from what we've seen on our first trip here organizers are doing all they can to make sure this Black Sea resort does the same as it plays host to the 2014 Winter Olympics.","The Russian city of Sochi will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in February .

"(CNN) -- In something of a surprise move, Apple began selling its new iPad Mini on Tuesday. The small tablet, with a speedier processor and the same high-definition ""retina display"" as its bigger cousins, is available from Apple's online store and from wireless partners AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. It's also being sold by selected third-party retailers such as Best Buy. Shoppers cannot buy them yet from Apple retail stores, although they can be picked up at stores after being ordered online. An Apple spokeswoman declined to say when they might become available for in-store purchases. The new Mini's release comes three weeks after Apple introduced the device and 12 days after the new full-size iPad Air went on sale. Many analysts had expected Apple to release the iPad Mini later this month, with speculation focusing on November 22. Apple tends to release new products on Fridays, giving them a full weekend to rack up sales while excitement is high. A product listing on Target's website recently listed the release date for the iPad Mini as November 21, although that date has since been removed. Supplies of the device appear to be limited at first, which may explain why Apple is not selling the new Mini in its stores. As of late morning Tuesday, Apple's online store was listing shipping delays of one to three business days for 16GB and 32GB models and five to 10 business days for models with higher amounts of storage. Early reports also have said Apple is facing a shortage of the Mini's new, high-definition display screens. The new Pad Mini has a 7.9-inch display (compared to 9.7 inches for the full-size iPad) and comes in two colors: silver or space gray. Prices range from $399 for a Wi-Fi-only, 16GB model to $829 for a 128GB model with cellular connectivity.","Apple began selling its new iPad Mini on Tuesday, but not in its stores .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- Syria's brutal conflict between regime and rebel forces is creeping closer and closer to nervous residents in the areas of Damascus still under government control. But in some suburbs of the capital, all-out war is already here. Snipers swap shots around the clock in Tadamon, a district in southern Damascus. The front line here has been static for months now, but fighting has increased recently as the government has won back neighboring districts and opposition fighters have fled to this area. ""It is pretty much every day that they try to attack our positions. It happens in the mornings, the afternoons, the evenings and at night. When we see them, we shoot,"" one Syrian soldier told CNN, never taking his eyes off the battle-scarred swath of no man's land visible through his sniper scope. The battle for the suburbs of Damascus will be key to deciding the outcome of the civil war in Syria. Much of the southern and eastern ring around the capital has fallen into the hands of rebel forces, often led by Islamist brigades, but the Syrian army is slowly winning back turf -- often at a high cost for both sides. The front line in Tadamon has gone back and forth between the rebels and the military for a long time. The commander in charge, who would only let us identify him as Abu Saleem, took us through a street that runs parallel to the front. ""We call this the lifeline,"" he said. ""We used this street to move around and resupply when the rebels nearly broke through. It was vital to holding on to this area."" Most of the residents have fled the buildings near the front line, but only a few yards away life continues at almost a normal pace. Children play in the streets, shops are open and cars edge along debris-littered streets. ""We had to leave our houses a few times because the fighting came so close,"" one local woman said. ""But the military was able to hold the opposition fighters up and things have become more calm recently."" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has made winning back the outskirts of Damascus a main priority. While Syrian soldiers in Tadamon are merely holding the line, in other districts, the army is on the offensive. Regime forces recently won back the district of Sbeneih south of the capital and have also made gains in Yarmouk, the district just west of Tadamon. Abu Saleem, the commander in charge of taking back Tadamon, says there are many foreign jihadists among the rebels his forces have encountered. ""The fighters from foreign countries are leaders,"" Saleem said, ""Especially from places like Libya, Chechnya, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. We hear from our sources inside that there are many foreign fighters there."" One opposition leader in the Eastern Ghouta region around Damascus who calls himself Abu Kareem called the army's siege of rebel-held areas ""genocidal."" ""We are facing a severe shortage of medicine and all medical supplies,"" Kareem told CNN. ""They are basically non-existent. We have gone back to the stone age."" Rebels say the Assad regime is trying to starve the civilians still stuck in contested areas. There have been reports and videos on social media of severely malnourished children and people eating leaves to survive. A photo that surfaced on Twitter in the past week allegedly shows residents of one Damascus subrub killing the lion at the local zoo for food. But the government claims the opposition is keeping aid convoys from reaching the districts under siege. International aid groups have blamed both sides of using access to food as a weapon. When asked what Syria's military was fighting for, Abu Saleem, the commander in Tadamon, insisted it was about more than simply preserving Assad's rule. ""This is not a battle of good against evil,"" he said. ""This is the battle of a secular state against Islamist ideals. We want to preserve Syria as a diverse society."" The soldiers in Tadamon say they are placing little hope in the Syrian peace talks scheduled to take place in Geneva, Switzerland next January. Right now they can't see beyond the mostly deserted streets of a neighborhood that both sides are reducing to rubble.","Syrian regime forces are battling rebels for control of suburbs surrounding Damascus .

"(CNN) -- Bright eyes, sparkling white teeth, big hair and barely covered breasts, these are the women whose gyrating hips bring a hint of glamor to National Football League fields from New England to California. The antithesis of the man-mountains they cheer on from the side lines, cheerleaders are the apple pie served up alongside the rib-eye steak of the NFL. ""It's entertainment, it's Hollywood, its spectacle,"" Joanne Gerstner, a past president of the Association for Women in Sports Media, told CNN. The stop-start nature of American Football -- there are many breaks in play with games lasting up to three hours -- provides the opportunity for these pompom-wielding women to help keep fans' eyes fixed on the field. ""I think it's everyone's dream, if you're a dancer, to pursue that passion at a professional level,"" Missy Mooty, a 26-year-old member of the Minnesota Vikings cheerleading squad, or MVC, told CNN ahead of a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Wembley in October. ""This is the time of my life that it worked out, it happened to be a dream that came true so it was a great next step in my dance career."" Blog: Redskins -- racist or sporting exception? Mooty and fellow MVC member Kaylee Munson are paid by the Vikings, but not enough to make a living, meaning cheerleading is combined with a career, full-time studies or balanced with family responsibilities. ""We like to say it's a part-time job, full-time commitment,"" said Munson, who works as a nurse in schools, teaching kids about healthy living. Cheerleading first came to the NFL in 1954, when they were premiered by the Baltimore Colts as part of the team's marching band. The spectacle snowballed and now most self-respecting NFL franchises wouldn't be seen dead without cheerleaders -- 26 of the 32 current NFL franchises have squads. Munson and Mooty have been dancing all their lives, taking the well-trodden path into the NFL through high-school and college dancing or by competing with a studio. ""I had always danced growing up, so I thought maybe I would try out for the Vikings to expand on my dance career,"" said Munson. ""So I gave it a shot, I tried out and made it my first year which was very exciting."" The skimpy attire a cheerleader is required to wear is water off a duck's back for two women with dancing backgrounds who work hard to sculpt and tone their bodies. ""In the culture of the dance world, that's just kind of the uniform,"" said Mooty. ""We need to be able to move and our bodies, our lines, need to be defined ... (the uniform) can be very sporty and be very flattering."" ""Of course, my grandma just loves our costume,"" adds Munson. ""She thinks it's the cutest darn thing ever and loves the sparkles on it. Everyone has a different point of view."" Blog: Why the clocks never go back in U.S. sport . Many cheerleaders also pride themselves on the work they do with their local communities, while some, like the New Orleans Saints demand the women have public speaking skills as well as dance technique. But a harsher view of the cheerleading industry is that women dancing on the fringes of competitive sport is an echo from an age of sexism and misogyny. ""When the whole essence of your job is basically hanging out in a tiny bikini and a bandeau top, it kind of undercuts the rest of your argument that you are a well-rounded person,"" said Gerstner, who is also professor of media & sports at the University of Michigan. A video released by the Miami Dolphins cheerleading squad showing women in bikinis dancing to Robin Thicke's blurred lines with the team's mascot ""TD"" arguably supports Gerstner's view. ""It's almost like in Paris, having the dancing girls doing the cancan while the guillotine is going down,"" added Gerstner, who views cheerleading as accessorizing women. Mooty and Munson remain undeterred and as cheerleading enters its seventh decade in the NFL, it shows no signs of kicking off its cowboy boots and calling it a day. ""Cheerleading has a long tradition in the majority of American sports at both professional and amateur levels,"" NFL head of communications David Tossell told CNN. ""Cheerleaders are part of American football culture from youth leagues to the NFL and are part of the game day experience for our fans."" The question of whether that culture is one that degrades women is one which hangs over cheerleaders like Mooty and Munson. Blog: The naked truth -- how close is too close? Many negative stereotypes surround the cheerleaders, but Mooty enjoys challenging people's preconceptions. ""I think that's a big challenge of ours to overcome,"" she said. ""We take a lot of pride in our uniforms and we like to use them to represent the team. It's part of our team spirit and part of the experience. ""I feel that if we offer a classy and poised portrayal, then hopefully that is the way that it is received. Like anything, it's in the eye of the beholder."" While the integrity of individuals like Mooty and Munson is unquestionable, Gerstner still feels cheerleading encourages people to judge women purely on their appearance. ""They might be intelligent, grounded amazing women but we're solely left to judge them by the outside packaging, which is getting skimpier and skimpier as cheerleading evolves in the United States. ""If cheerleaders are necessary, why are there no cheerleaders for any women's sports?""","Cheerleaders have been involved in the NFL since 1954 .

"(CNN) -- For many, back-to-school is a season of anticipation, nostalgia, and shopping. For me, it evokes memories of an unsung historical event: the integration of Harvard. No, I'm not talking about racial integration; I'm talking about the full inclusion of students with disabilities. When I entered Harvard College as a freshman in 1980, it happened to coincide with a new requirement -- all institutions receiving federal funds had to become fully accessible under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. I was a 17-year-old lifelong wheelchair-user, born with a neurological condition called spinal muscular atrophy. I'd never walked or stood and my arms were weak as a baby's. But, as my parents often said, there was nothing wrong with my head. I had little awareness of the precedent I was setting. At 17, I was too self-centered for that. I was preoccupied with how I'd cope my first time living away from my parents, depending on full-time, live-in personal-care attendants. Yet I had an Ivy League freshman's cockiness, too. Somehow I'd manage. I'd always managed before, hadn't I? To be sure, Harvard had had students with disabilities before me. But those students had to make do, bearing or circumventing access barriers without complaint. After all, it was a centuries-old campus. How much could one expect? I, on the other hand, had rights -- and expectations. I challenged the university in a whole new way. I was an inadvertent pioneer. I mean, it wasn't my fault. I hadn't fought for my rights. They fell into my lap. The timing was a coincidence, one I wasn't entirely comfortable with. I remember meeting with university officials the summer before my freshman year got under way. We discussed every detail of my life and needs. What was the width my widest wheelchair? Did I take baths or showers? How much space around a toilet did I require for transfers? Boxers or briefs? (Just kidding.) I also had to pre-pick classes so Harvard could ensure mine would be held in accessible classrooms, of which there were too few. If I changed my mind, I could be out of luck. Not that pioneering was an unfamiliar role for me. I'd been the first and only ""handicapped"" student in my nursery, elementary and high schools, too. My parents had insisted on my attending ""regular"" schools at a time when that was unheard of. In the 1960s, according to government statistics, only one in five disabled kids was educated in a public school -- usually a separate (dare I say ""segregated""?) special-ed school. The majority stayed home or got sent off to under-regulated residential institutions. More than a million handicapped kids had no access to the school system at all. Many states even had statutes specifically excluding the deaf, blind or mentally retarded from public schooling! We lived in New York, and my parents were private-school kind of people. I vaguely recall how the schools my older, non-disabled brother attended refused to accept me, how my parents had to argue and beg on my behalf. They knew separate wasn't equal, but they had no legal recourse. I ended up at the only private schools willing to take a kid in a wheelchair. It's no exaggeration to say that for many years I assumed I was simply too dumb for my parents' first-choice schools. Today, of course, it's completely different. After countless pieces of legislation, reauthorizations, government commissions and legal rulings, wheelchair ramps and lifts, Braille and recorded books, sign-language interpreters, ""shadow teachers,"" and other accommodations are commonplace in schools as they are elsewhere. Parents of so-called special-needs kids still have to fight sometimes to ensure fairness, but they have rights and a grievance process on their side. Integration is the standard that must be met. Ultimately, my Harvard experience had its ups and downs, as might be expected of what was a revolutionary new concept. Sadly, it wasn't just the ancient brick buildings and cobblestone paths that posed inexorable barriers; sometimes hidebound traditions can be equally obdurate. Nevertheless, how the demographics of education has changed became especially clear to me recently when my kids' school held a ""diversity day."" (My kids don't have disabilities, but some of their classmates do.) I boldly volunteered to lead a discussion about people with disabilities. To my surprise, I wasn't the only one. Kids don't always appreciate this. For them, the return to the school year is a ritualized obligation. What a shame so few understand it as a right and a privilege to be celebrated -- a proud and hard-won victory.

"(CNN) -- An Illinois woman who left her mentally disabled daughter outside a Tennessee bar cannot be charged with a crime, police said Tuesday. Police in Caryville, Tennessee, said the daughter is 19 and not assigned to a legal guardian. ""As terrible as it is, unfortunately there is nothing we can do,"" Assistant Police Chief Stephanie Smith said. ""There is no doubt we need a law for mental health rights, but pending this investigation, we just don't know what else to do."" According to police, Eva Cameron stopped at the Big Orange Bar in Caryville on June 28 when her daughter, Lynn, needed to use the restroom. The mother left Lynn by the side of the road and returned to her home in Algonquin, Illinois, according to Smith. ""(Lynn) didn't know her age, she didn't know her address, she didn't know her phone number and she didn't even know her name,"" Smith said. Eva Cameron told the Northwest Herald newspaper in Illinois that she brought Lynn to Caryville because of its concentration of Baptists and because Tennessee has the ""No. 1 health care system in the United States of America."" Mentally disabled man says he was kept in nailed-shut closet . The young woman's identity was unknown until Caryville police received an anonymous tip on Monday, having released a picture and requested information from the public. At their request, Eva Cameron had a brief meeting with Caryville police on Tuesday. She signed a statement saying that Lynn Cameron was now a ward of Tennessee, officials said. ""She basically said, 'I don't want her and I don't want to take her.' Then she got in her car and she left,"" said Smith. When reached later Tuesday by CNN, Eva Cameron said, ""We understand she lost her ID card and that's how the situation has turned into what happened. She's already an adult. I just have to leave it at that."" Eva Cameron would not answer further questions. Authorities took Lynn Cameron to a hospital, where she was discovered to have only a basic vocabulary of 30-40 words, according to Smith. A Campbell County Chancery Court order in the case described Lynn Cameron as a ""severely disabled adult, suffering from profound mental deficits, and is unable to care for herself or her personal needs."" According to the court, the mother stated ""she could not and would not care for Lynn Cameron."" Eva Cameron said that she has another disabled child and that caring for both was too much to handle, according to the Northwest Herald. Authorities said Lynn Cameron is being cared for at a facility in Roane County. When asked how the young woman is doing, Smith replied, ""Lynn is doing fantastic.""

"(CNN) -- Champions League finalists Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund rounded off their Bundesliga seasons in contrasting styles Saturday ahead of their May 25 showdown at Wembley. Bayern came from two goals behind for a 4-3 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach while Dortmund surrendered a lead to lose 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim, who kept their hopes of avoiding the drop alive. Bayern's 29th league win from 34 matches gave them a record tally of 91 points -- fully 25 points clear of Dortmund, who had been the reigning champions. Veteran Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes was saying farewell to the Bundesliga after 1,011 games -- he will be replaced by Pep Guardiola next season -- and the match had an added poignancy because it was against one of his former sides. They looked like spoiling his party as they led Bayern 3-1 inside the first 10 minutes, but Franck Ribery with a double, also setting up Arjen Robben for the second half winner, left Heynckes beaming. ""I had the feeling the team were still at last Saturday's party to celebrate the league title,"" he told their official website. ""But the team slowly got the game under control and we played like we're used to in the second half. I realized my team wanted to win for me."" Heynckes had fielded a full strength line-up tipped to start next Saturday's final but Austrian defender Martin Stranzl and striker Mike Hanke, on his farewell for Moenchengladbach, put the home side 2-0 ahead in the opening moments. Javi Martinez pulled one back for the champions before Havard Nordtveit made it 3-1. Bayern had conceded only 15 goals in the entire Bundesliga season going into the final match. Then came Ribery to the rescue with a fine strike on 18 minutes, an equalizer early in the second half and a cross for Robben to tap home the winner. Dortmund's opponents Hoffenheim were fighting for their Bundesliga life and it looked bleak for the strugglers when Robert Lewandowski put the home side ahead after just six minutes -- the 24th of the league campaign for the Polish star. Juergen Klopp's men should have added to their tally but with 13 minutes left Mats Hummels fouled Kevin Volland to concede a penalty and also limped off with a turned ankle, leaving him a possible doubt for next week's final. Sejad Salihovic leveled from the spot and four minutes later had a second penalty opportunity after home keeper Roman Weidenfeller fouled Sven Schipplock and was sent off. Salihovic netted the penalty and Hoffenheim held on to earn a relegation playoff against Kaiserslautern. ""We now draw a thick line under the Bundesliga season and see now if all the players are fit for the final,"" Klopp told AFP after the defeat. Elsewhere, Schalke 04 earned a Champions League spot for next season with a 2-1 win at SC Freiburg, who will have to settle for a Europa League place. Julian Draxler put Schalke ahead in the first half but Jonathan Schmid leveled for Freiburg just after the break. An own goal from Julian Schuster saw Schalke ahead again and left Freiburg in fifth place in the final standings. With Hoffenheim winning, Fortuna Dusseldorf were automatically relegated, losing 3-0 at Hanover. Stefan Kiessling stayed ahead of Lewandowski as the Bundesliga top-scorer as he sealed third-placed Bayer Leverkusen's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a last minute goal -- his 25th of the campaign.","Bayern Munich round off triumphant Bundesliga season with dramatic away win .

"(CNN) -- The adoptive parents of a child born with male and female organs say South Carolina mutilated their son by choosing a gender and having his male genitalia surgically removed. The surgery took place when the child was 16 months old and a ward of the state, according to a lawsuit filed by the parents against three doctors and several members of the South Carolina Department of Social Services. The child's biological mother was deemed unfit, and the biological father had apparently abandoned him, according to the suit. So others made the decision. The child, now 8 years old, feels more like a boy and ""wants to be a normal boy,"" said Pamela Crawford, the boy's adoptive mother. ""It's become more and more difficult, just as his identity has become more clearly male, the idea that mutilation was done to him had become more and more real,"" she said in a video released by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is assisting in the case. ""There was no medical reason that this decision had to be made at this time."" Marilyn Matheus, a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Social Services, said the agency does not have any comment on the pending litigation. The defendants named in the suit also include doctors from Medical University of South Carolina and Greenville Memorial Hospital. Sandy Dees, a spokeswoman for the Greenville Health System, said she could not comment because of the litigation. Assigned to be a girl, but identifying as a boy . The child, identified in the lawsuit as ""M.C.,"" refuses to be called a girl and lives as a boy. His family, friends, school, religious leaders and pediatrician support his identity. ""We just let him follow his instincts as much as we can,"" his adoptive father, John Mark Crawford, said in the video. Pamela Crawford said performing gender assignment surgery on a baby robbed her child of the ability to make the decision for himself. ""I would have never made the decision to choose the gender either way,"" she said. ""What I would have been working with is how do we preserve as much functioning in either direction because we can't know what this child's gender identity is going to be."" The lawsuit claims doctors at a state hospital and Department of Social Services workers ""decided to remove M.C.'s healthy genital tissue and radically restructure his reproductive organs in order to make his body appear to be female."" The suit says the surgery violated the 14th Amendment, which says that no state shall ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."" The suit also asks for ""compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial."" But the adoptive father said the real intent of the lawsuit ""is just to uphold these constitutional principles -- integrity of a person's body, and some kind of due process for infants where people around them in power are considering doing surgeries like this."" Pamela Crawford agreed. ""I would give anything for this to not have been done to our child,"" she said. ""I don't want it to happen to any more kids.""","""M.C."" was born with both male and female organs .

"(CNN) -- It's a fear that keeps cybersecurity experts up at night: an attack on an online election system. Apparently, it's now come to pass. According to a grand jury report about problems in an August 14, 2012, primary election in Miami-Dade County, Florida, ""someone created a computer program that automatically, systematically and rapidly submitted to the County's Department of Elections numerous bogus on-line requests for absentee ballots."" It's the first documented attack on a U.S. election, said computer scientist David Jefferson, who is on the board of the Verified Voting Foundation and the California Voter Foundation, in an interview with CNN. The report notes that 2,500 fraudulent requests were submitted. (For perspective, Miami-Dade mailed out 139,047 absentee ballots last July and another 174,919 in October.) With voting by mail increasing, the fact that the system was challenged is worrisome for cybersecurity experts. ""The computer scientists have been saying for many years now that this is going to be possible, and one of the counters to us has been, 'How come it hasn't happened?' We always say, we don't know if it's happened, because it might happen without leaving any evidence,"" said Avi Rubin, a Johns Hopkins computer science professor who is an expert in cybersecurity. ""And now we're finally starting to see proof that it actually does happen."" Jefferson, who classified the attack as ""weak,"" nevertheless highlighted several reasons to be concerned. ""It's clear that the attackers knew what they were doing, did it deliberately (and) tried to cover their tracks -- they were deliberately hiding their actions,"" he said. Moreover, he added, ""It is not at all clear what their motives were."" According to the report, Miami-Dade's online ballot request system had ""very low"" security, with no user-specific logins or passwords. A concerned election vendor noted the influx of requests and flagged them, said the report. ""The vendor hired by Election officials ... became suspicious when it appeared that an extraordinary number of absentee ballot requests 1) appeared to be submitted from the same group of computers; and 2) were being submitted at a rate that was not humanly possible if the data on the screen was being entered by a person,"" the report said. The requests came from IP addresses primarily located overseas, the report added, ""although there was at least one fraudulent request from inside the United States."" The grand jury report is dated December 19, 2012. Its findings were reported last month by the Miami Herald, although they did not receive widespread national attention until now. Florida, of course, is no stranger to electoral snafus. In 2012 alone, the state endured long lines, chaotic polling places and disputes over legislative actions that shortened the number of days and hours for early voting. But Jefferson says that, in terms of online issues, the state is far from the worst. He said he and his colleagues in the cybersecurity community found two states that had ""serious vulnerabilities"" in their online registration systems: Washington and Maryland. ""Those dangers were so severe because it would not take a lot of skill to change the registrations of thousands of voters, online, while sitting in, say, Bulgaria,"" he said. With hackers getting increasingly sophisticated, Rubin expects there will be more cyberattacks in the future. Indeed, even putting elections aside, reports of denial-of-service attacks, stolen passwords and other cases of Internet invasion are regular occurrences in the news -- and they've affected major corporations, government agencies and even security companies, Jefferson observes. That doesn't mean we have to revert back to dropping paper ballots in an old wooden box. Rubin believes that election authorities ""do a pretty good job at understanding their threats."" It's just that voting is such a sensitive issue that they should have to plan for the worst -- and be prepared to handle it. ""The first thing to do is have a realistic understanding of the threat, so that before you offer a service on the Internet you know how you're going to respond when you're attacked -- and I say 'when' and not 'if' you're attacked,"" he said. Indeed, Jefferson hopes that the Miami-Dade report serves as a wake-up call for authorities who have scoffed at computer scientists' concerns. ""For me, of course, this is no surprise. I've seen this and much worse in many circumstances,"" he said. ""But because this is the first real documented attack in a U.S. election, it has outsized importance. We can now say we do have an example in a U.S. election of a bona fide cyberattack. You don't have to believe us -- we didn't write that grand jury report. Read it."" Cyberthreats getting worse, House intelligence officials warn . Alan Brill, senior managing director for Kroll Advisory Solutions, is optimistic that the wake-up call will be received promptly. ""If you look back, 20, 25 years, (legislators) had no real understanding of computers. But over time, it's kind of a rising tide"" of comprehension, he says. ""As you get more specialists in a field like this, I think the risks become more evident, and it becomes more urgent for them to do something about it.""","A grand jury report outlines problems in an August 14, 2012, primary election in Florida .

"Moscow (CNN) -- A twin-engine plane carrying 43 people crashed soon after takeoff in Siberia on Monday, killing all but 12 people on board, Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said. The plane had taken off from the city of Tyumen and traffic control lost contact with it immediately afterward, the ministry said. The ATR-72 plane was carrying 39 passengers and four crew members. UTair, the flight operator, said the plane was trying to make an emergency landing when it went down, the RIA-Novosti news agency said. Twelve survivors were taken to hospitals, while everyone else on board, including all four crew members, was killed, ministry said. The survivors were in intensive care, RIA-Novosti said. Authorities could not say with certainty what caused the crash. Officials have recovered the plane's data recorders, which will help shed light on what happened in the flight's final minutes. ""Malfunction and pilot's error are considered to be the most likely causes,"" Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Russian Investigation Committee, told the Itar-Tass news agency. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has postponed a meeting with the opposition light of the crash, his spokeswoman Natalya Timakova said. Specialists from France, Canada and Great Britain will take part in the crash investigation, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, citing the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee. The plane was built in France and was registered in Britain. The engine was produced in Canada, the agency said. The crash was the the country's deadliest air disaster since a crash in Yaroslavl that killed 44 people in September. Dozens of Yaroslavl Lokomotiv professional hockey players died in that crash, including several former National Hockey League players. Only one person survived the crash, which investigators found was caused by pilot error, RIA-Novosti reported. CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Experts from Britain, France and Canada will help investigate .

"(CNN) -- Every American community has its borders. Manhattan, for example, has East 96th Street. It divides, in a squishy and always-changing sort of way, East Harlem, the poorest neighborhood on the island, from the Upper East Side, which is among the wealthiest. Stand on the street and you'll see people crossing from one world to the other in both directions. But the boundary does have real meaning for some. This summer, I met Giovanni Classen, a young father and college student who was living in one of the public housing projects in East Harlem. He told me he once took a girlfriend on a date on the Upper East Side. The questioning stares of richer New Yorkers tainted the experience. His date's interest in window shopping didn't help either. Across 96th, he felt different. Or was made to feel that way. The river, the highway, the tracks. All of these unspoken lines have shaped American consciousness. This is increasingly true in the age of income inequality. As the gap between rich and poor continues to grow, so does the gulf in understanding between the classes. We're not helped by the fact that, as Harvard's Michael Norton put it to me, the ends of the income spectrum are mostly invisible. We don't see billionaires picking up their morning papers. The extremely poor are among the most stigmatized groups in the United States. We see past them, as one man who works in Chelsea, the ritzy-poor Manhattan neighborhood, told me recently. We pretend they're not there, that these divisions don't exist in the richest country in the world. Maybe one way to help shrink the gap between rich and poor, then, is simply to stare these divisions right in the face -- to remind ourselves that these boundaries were created and can be erased. To that end, I'd like to invite you to participate in a collaborative storytelling experiment called ""Cross the Gap."" Here's how to participate: . 1. Take a photo of something that divides your community. 2. Upload the image to CNN iReport or to an online social network. 3. Include the hashtag #crossthegap with your submission. 4. In the caption, write why this particular thing -- it could be a highway, a sign, a language barrier, a park, a building, whatever -- divides your community. Say a little bit about yourself or your hometown. Which side of the gap do you inhabit? And what could you do to help make that barrier less formal or significant? I'll give a few examples to help clear things up. In Oklahoma City, where I used to live, the Oklahoma River and Interstate 40 broadly split the community in two. Everyone asks whether you're from the north side or the south. The social circles are pretty different. In Lake Providence, Louisiana, where I traveled recently to report a story on income inequality, a beautiful, cypress-lined lake largely separates rich from poor. And New York is a maze of shifting and unspoken dividers. Go to Chelsea and you'll find blocks where the rich and poor stare at each other out of their windows. I'm excited to see what you come up with for this assignment. As you take the photos, I'd ask you to think about the economic and cultural forces that keep us apart -- and what each of us could do to bring everyone, regardless of income, closer together.
