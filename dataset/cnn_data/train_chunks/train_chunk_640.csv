"By . Tom Kelly, John Stevens and Ryan Kisiel . PUBLISHED: . 18:14 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:19 EST, 7 August 2013 . 'Disgrace': Barrister Robert Colover has been criticised by campaigners for describing a 13-year-old victim of a sex abuse case 'predatory' David Cameron yesterday condemned a prosecution barrister for describing the 13-year-old victim of a paedophile as sexually ‘predatory’. He urged the courts to ‘stand up for  victims’ after Neil Wilson, 41, escaped jail despite luring the girl to his home, where she performed a sex act on him. Child protection campaigners labelled barrister Robert Colover a ‘disgrace’ and called for his dismissal. They also warned that his ‘crass’ comments would stop other young abuse victims from coming forward. Mr Colover has been suspended from prosecuting sex trials after he told Snaresbrook Crown Court in London that the girl ‘forced’ herself on Wilson, describing her as ‘predatory in all her actions’ and ‘sexually experienced’. He said: ‘She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15-year-old. There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing. ‘You might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her.’ Judge Nigel Peters, QC, is also being investigated for telling Wilson the girl was ‘egging you on’ and that she looked and behaved ‘a little bit older’ than her age as he gave him a suspended sentence. Wilson admitted two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child. His own solicitor told Monday’s sentencing hearing that the paedophile could still pose a risk to children. In a separate move, it emerged that sex offence trials involving vulnerable children will be conducted by a newly chosen team of specially vetted judges, to protect child witnesses from  brutal cross-examination by trial barristers. Under fire: Judge Nigel Peters is also being investigated for suggesting the victim was 'egging on' paedophile Neil Wilson . Neil Wilson spotted his victim amid the bustle of Romford town centre at the start of March last year. The 13-year-old girl was playing truant from school and wandering the streets asking strangers for cigarettes. Wilson obliged when she asked him – offering her an entire packet. He then took her back to his flat near the town centre for coffee. The girl allegedly looked around 14 or 15 and acted as if she was older than her years. However, she was clearly underage – and nearly three decades younger than Wilson who was 39 at the time. Over the next two weeks the pair enjoyed a brief ‘fling’, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. The girl was described by the prosecutor and judge as a ‘sexual predator’. But during this time it was Wilson who bombarded her with phone calls and text messages as she continued to visit his home, the court heard. On March 20, exactly two weeks after her first visit, the girl went back to Wilson’s flat after they agreed to meet. They sat in his lounge and talked about their relationship. Wilson claims at this point he told her they had to stop seeing each other because they would get in trouble. The girl, who was dressed in her school uniform, asked if she could change out of it and Wilson left the room. When he returned she had undressed and was sat wearing a T-shirt. Wilson claims he asked her to put her clothes on, but she started kissing him before touching his genitals. He said he pushed her away and told her he did not want to see her any more. At no point did they have sex. Robert Colover, prosecuting, told the court that the sexual activity was ‘not of Mr Wilson’s doing’. He added: ‘You might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her.’ The abuse came to light only when the girl told a friend what happened and the police were called. When officers went to Wilson’s home, they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer. Four of the images were surreptitiously taken photographs of children in play areas or other safe environments showing either underwear or varying degrees of nakedness. There were also 11 sexually explicit images involving horses and dogs. Wilson told police that he watched hardcore pornography but that he had deleted it from his computer. Yesterday the Prime Minister said it was ‘absolutely right’ that the Crown Prosecution Service had rebuked Mr Colover for his comments. He said: ‘It isn’t appropriate. We need a criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims. The victims should always be at the centre of our thinking. ‘The CPS themselves have said that this isn’t appropriate, the Attorney General is going to look into the case and we need a system that properly stands up for victims.’ Marilyn Hawes, director of child protection charity Enough Abuse, said: ‘This needs to be nipped in the bud. Are we in 1913 or 2013? Judges and barristers should be removed if they use language like this. ‘Vulnerable witnesses won’t come forward if they are going to be treated this way in court. They are fragile children, they are not just pieces of evidence to be used in a case.' Emily Thornberry, Labour’s Shadow Attorney General, said: ‘It is appalling that after the scandals of Jimmy Savile and Rochdale these awful Lolita prejudices are still being served up in court, and by the prosecution of all people.’ She has written to the Bar Standards Board to examine whether Mr Colover violated its code of conduct. Investigation: The Crown Prosecution Service has launched a probe following the case at Snaresbrook Crown Court . Charity Victim Support also condemned the teenager’s treatment. Its chief executive Javed Khan said: ‘It is completely unacceptable for victims to be blamed in any way for the abuse they have suffered. ‘The state owes a duty of care to victims and witnesses, which in this case appears to have been woefully neglected. We have strenuously campaigned for cultural change to this often adversarial, aggressive courts system.’ There was further anger yesterday as a high profile human rights lawyer appeared to defend the prosecutor’s comments. Barbara Hewson, a barrister for Hardwicke Chambers, tweeted: ‘It takes two to tango. Disgusting tho’ these men are, frankly the girls are often not much better – and no shrieking martyrs.’ The CPS said: ‘The word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the CPS. The Director of Public Prosecutions will be undertaking a review of this case to determine what happened and to decide what action needs to be taken. The Attorney General’s Office said the case had been drawn to its attention ‘as a possibly unduly lenient sentence’. The Office for Judicial Complaints said it would consider a number of complaints it had received about Judge Peters’s remarks. There was no answer at Mr Colover’s £900,000 home in Streatham, South London, yesterday.","Robert Colover labelled a 'disgrace' by campaigners after comments .

The parents of a teenager who died after taking a ‘designer drug’ yesterday condemned the supplier for effectively murdering her. Poppy Rodgers, 16, collapsed after ignoring a friend’s warning not to try 4-methylamphetamine, a Class A drug. She was ‘poisoned’ by Luke Carey, 25, who bragged about buying the drug, a derivative of amphetamine (speed), at a cheap rate and knew that the batch was blamed for the death of a 22-year-old man a year earlier. Jailed: Luke Carey, 25 , left,  was today jailed for supplying 16-year-old . college student Poppy Rogers , right, with a Class A drug at a house party on the . night that she died .

Carey, who admitted seven charges . related to the supply of drugs, was jailed for six years and five months . at York Crown Court yesterday in what Judge Michael Mettyear described . as a ‘truly tragic case’. The teenager’s father, Mark, said . outside court: ‘I understand in law this might not be murder but, given . the circumstances, it certainly feels like that to us. ‘Adults may choose to take drugs but those prepared to give drugs to a child, they are beyond reproach. ‘Carey gave this poison to my little girl with the full knowledge that it had already killed someone.’ Sent down: Carey, right, is led away from York Crown Court after he was was jailed for six years and five months today . Poppy was at a friend’s house in York . in April last year when Carey produced a bag of drugs he claimed was . ecstasy and she tried some. Nicholas Worsley, prosecuting, said . Poppy’s eyes began rolling and she was sweating heavily ‘but despite . this Carey asked her if she wanted more’. Paramedics were called but she died in hospital. One of her friends was also taken to hospital but survived. Police searched Carey’s house and found a bag of the substance with an estimated street value of £1,400. He initially denied any wrongdoing and . claimed others in the house were trying to set him up, the court heard. But he pleaded guilty on the day he was due to stand trial. Carey was aware the strong drugs had . been linked to the death of John Causer the previous May and yet gave it . out and tried some himself. Poppy’s mother, Ann, said in a . statement: ‘The day that Carey gave my child poison not only ended her . life but took mine too. Everyday hurts. I feel pain I never knew . existed. ‘Grief consumes me every minute of . every day. Some days I cope more than others. Some days I don’t cope at . all. Some days I wish I never woke up.’ Richard Reed, defending, said Carey . enjoyed getting high with other people. ‘He will have to live for the . rest of his life with the consequences of his actions,’ he said. Detective Chief Inspector Nigel . Costello of North Yorkshire Police said: ‘Carey played roulette with a . life that wasn’t his own.

Christopher Oakes, 37, has been jailed for seven and half years after he stormed into the house of Sarah Clarke, 35, and attacked her . A mother was beaten up in her own home by a robber who used a five-year-old child to lure her to the door and trick his way into the house. Christopher Oakes, 37, has been jailed for seven and half years after he stormed into the house of Sarah Clarke, 35, and attacked her. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that the mother-of- three was woken at around 3.30am on February 11 last year by a knock at her door while her soldier husband was away on tour in Afghanistan. She said she spotted a young boy standing alone outside and went to investigate. Seconds later, two intruders emerged from around a corner and wrestled her back inside, it was said. Oakes and his accomplice - who has not been caught - then subjected Mrs Clarke to a brutal attack by pinning her against a wall and punching her in the face and head. Despite trying to fight off her attackers the pair then fled from the property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, with bank cards and cash from her purse. Oakes, from Bucknall, Staffordshire, was arrested near the scene and charged with robbery after Mrs Clarke picked him out of a police line-up. On Tuesday he was jailed for seven-and-a-half years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after a jury found him guilty at a trial last month. He maintains his innocence and plans to appeal his conviction. Judge Paul Glenn said the use of a child demonstrated ‘pre-planning’ by Oakes and his accomplice. He said: 'This involves a victim in her own home. She was put in significant fear. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that the mother of three was attacked after she answered a knock at her door and saw a young boy standing outside. When she went to investigate two intruders wrestled her back inside . 'Two men were involved, there was some planning and her children were upstairs in bed. As a mother she instinctively went to the door. 'As soon as she opened the door she was physically attacked. This must have been a terrifying experience for her. 'She sustained physical injuries. What happened to her will live with her for a long time, probably permanently.' Jason Holt, defending, said Oakes, who has no previous convictions, maintains his innocence and plans to appeal his conviction.","Robber Christopher Oakes, 37, has been jailed .

Detectives who investigated the Great Train Robbery were praised for solving the 'crime of the century - 50 years after the infamous heist took place. Eighteen retired Buckinghamshire Constabulary investigators and backroom staff were reunited at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire. They received commendations on the eve of the £2.6 million robbery's 50th anniversary from Thames Valley Police chief constable Sara Thornton. Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a combined total of more than 300 years after they stopped the Glasgow to Euston overnight mail train, which was carrying huge numbers of used bank notes, as it passed through the Buckinghamshire countryside close to Cheddington on August 8 1963.

In those days we got dressed - suit, collar and tie - and off we went.' After first collecting evidence on the railtrack, Mr Milner spent nine months attached to the investigation as the officer in charge of exhibits.

Amazon was dragged into the scandal over a notorious cyber-bullying site yesterday after it emerged that the web retailer ‘hosts’ the controversial social network. It can shut down Ask.fm, but has ignored a plea to do so from a British internet safety consultant. The revelation prompted the parents of children who died after being trolled on the ‘disgusting’ website to urge Amazon to take action, while experts accused Ask.fm of ‘promoting’ cyber-bullying. The homepage of ask.fm: Jennifer Perry, author of the UK national guidelines on combating digital stalking, said the website promoted trolling by encouraging anonymous abuse . David Smith, whose daughter Hannah, 14, was found hanged on Friday after months of abuse, yesterday called on Amazon to shut down Latvian-based Ask.fm. Hannah was urged to kill herself or ‘drink bleach’ on the site, which earns £5million a year from adverts and lets its 60million members post comments anonymously. Mr Smith, a 45-year-old lorry driver from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, said: ‘I’m shocked that a supposedly respectable company such as Amazon could be connected to Ask.fm. Found hanged: Schoolgirl Hannah Smith, 14, who committed suicide after she was the victim of 'trolling' on internet site ask.fm . 'Unfortunately, the big internet companies such as Ask.fm and Amazon are only interested  in money. ‘Ask.fm . makes £5million a year by causing people misery. If I decided to cause . people misery I would be arrested and sent down.’ Charles Conway, an internet child safety consultant, said he contacted Amazon in May after conducting a Google search of phrases such as ‘kill yourself’ and ‘ugly sl**’ that revealed more than 59,000 examples of bullying and racist or threatening comments on Ask.fm. But even though Amazon’s acceptable-usage policy gives it the right to terminate customers’ use of its service if they ‘encourage, promote or facilitate harmful or offensive’ content, he was ‘fobbed off’ and told to take up his concerns with Ask.fm directly. Yesterday, Mr Conway called for the site to be classed alongside porn as ‘adult content’, meaning it could be blocked from homes under Government plans to clean up the internet next year. Mr Conway, from Wrexham, North Wales, said: ‘I cannot see a legitimate use for Ask.fm other than for cyber-bullying. 'The company knows exactly what sort of abuse goes on, yet does nothing to tackle it.’ He discovered Ask.fm was hosted by Amazon, which rents web-space on its servers, after being called by a parent whose 12-year-old daughter was almost suicidal. Trolls on the site had targeted her because she would not sleep with her boyfriend. Hosts: Charles Conway, an internet child safety consultant, said he contacted Amazon about Ask.fm in May after finding bullying and threatening comments on the site, but was 'fobbed off' Jennifer Perry, author of the UK . national guidelines on combating digital stalking, said Ask.fm promoted . trolling by encouraging anonymous abuse, adding: ‘It means everybody . becomes your stalker, you don’t know if it’s a stranger or your best . friend that’s doing it. That’s very distressing.’ Last autumn, two Irish girls – Ciara Pugsley, 15, and Erin Gallagher, 13  – took their lives after being bullied on the site. Eight weeks later, Erin’s sister, Shannon, 15, killed herself in grief. Ciara’s father, Jonathan, said Amazon should ‘examine their morals’, adding: ‘You’d think someone as big as Amazon would be distancing themselves from sites like this.’ Tony Traynor, father of Erin and Shannon Gallagher, said he would boycott Amazon, adding: ‘Someone has to take the blame. If Amazon is providing the web-space for Ask.fm then they should close it.’ In April, Josh Unsworth, 15, was found hanged in Goosnargh,  Lancashire, after suffering months of abusive messages on Ask.fm. His father, Gary, called on Amazon to ‘take some responsibility’. Amazon has not commented.","Amazon hosts Ask.fm, which has been implicated in a string of suicides .

Rania Alayed, 25, was reported missing from her home in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, on July 2 - nearly a month after she was last seen in public on the evening of June 7. Ms Alayad's husband Ahmed Khatib, 33, and his brother Muhanned Mahmood Al Khatib, 38, have now both been charged with murder.  Ms Alayad's brother-in-law has also been charged with perverting the course of justice. Police believe she was taken in a white camper van in the early hours of June 8 to the Thirsk area of North Yorkshire, where her body was disposed. The Leyland DAF 200 vehicle, . registration number F864 RJB, is believed to have stopped in an . unidentified layby on the northbound A19. Officers from Greater Manchester Police . (GMP), supported by teams from North Yorkshire and aerial assistance . from the RAF, are now searching for her body along the 30km stretch of the A19 between the junctions of the A168 and the A172 at Osmotherley. Letters have been sent to 350 motorists who are known to have driven in the area between 3am and 5am on June 8 to see if they have any information on the movements of the camper van, which has since been recovered. Ms Alayed previously lived in Norton, Stockton-On-Tees, and moved to Manchester in January. Her disappearance was described by police as 'extremely out of character'. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is also investigating how GMP dealt with previous contact with Ms Alayed, who reported being a victim of domestic violence. Detective Chief Inspector Peter Marsh, of GMP, said: 'We believe Rania is on that stretch of road. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Police are appealing for any information about this camper van which they believe may have been used to dispose of the body of Rania Alayad . 'We are now satisfied that from the 8th of June there is nothing to suggest that Rania is alive. 'It is a huge search and it is a case of narrowing it down. The area is farming land with open fields and ditches around. 'We believe the Rania's body is buried or concealed somewhere. 'We are hoping to hear from anyone who saw this white camper van and, in particular, if they saw it parked by the side of the road or in a layby. 'I am also interested to hear from anyone walking in the area or working who may have seen some suspicious activity or come across any unusual areas of ground such as a disturbance, cut vegetation. Investigation: Police outside the homes of Rania's husband Ahmed Khatib in Gorton, Manchester, after he was charged with murder of the missing mother-of-three . 'We have been working closely with our colleagues in North Yorkshire Police and have used specialist search equipment supplied by the military to help locate her. 'As Rania still remains missing, it is crucial that we go to the next stage and publicly appeal for information. If you believe you saw Rania after 7pm on 7th June 2013, we are keen to hear from you.' Anyone with information on the movements of the white camper van should contact the Major Investigation Team on 0161 856 4711.

The pensioner, who is Mrs Reeve’s godmother, was left with no money to pay her own bills, Teesside Crown Court heard. The pair, from Hartlepool, took over Mrs Killen’s finances when the spinster was taken into a care home in 2009 with dementia. They are accused of milking her bank account dry and cashing in her benefits for themselves. Prosecutor Matthew Bean told the court how Mrs Killen was left without pocket money while her goddaughter, 56, and Mr Reeve, 55, spent her savings within just two years. More than £11,000 went on paying off Mrs Reeve’s credit card bill while the couple also bought a car, revamped their £220,000 detached home and added new furniture. When they were arrested last year, they claimed the garage conversion on the four-bedroom property was being carried out so that the pensioner could move in with them when she recovered. But a planning application submitted to the council detailed installing a gym and a wet room – and made no mention of a bedroom. Opening the case, barrister  Mr Bean told the jury: ‘The prosecution say that this money was taken from her account in order for them to spend it on themselves. 'The prosecution say the money was used to pay for the conversion at their house . . . and also used by the defendants to buy a car, furnishings and electrical equipment. ‘We ask you to look at this woman’s mental health. Building work: The property where the Reeves proposed the garage conversion would be carried out. However a planning application was said to have detailed installing a gym and a wet-room - and made no mention of a bedroom for a pensioner . ‘It shows she was vulnerable and suffering from a gradual deterioration in her capacity due to the onset of dementia. ‘The prosecution say both defendants must have been well aware of this and decided to take advantage of her vulnerability by taking and spending her life savings.’ The court heard that Mrs Killen had ‘substantial’ savings of more than £130,000 in January 2009, but within two years there was just over £3,000 left in her accounts. Council officials launched an investigation after realising the care home resident was often left without pocket money and did not have enough to meet her bills. Mr Reeve twice ignored letters to provide detailed bank statements, said Mr Bean, because he knew there was little left and the discovery of that could lead to police involvement. Soon after, small amounts of money were transferred back into the pensioner’s accounts in a cynical attempt to hide the thefts, the prosecutor said. 'Taking advantage': There was regular spending by the couple at Next (left), Marks & Spencer (right, both file pictures) and Argos, funded by Miss Killen, the court was told . Case: The couple are accused at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) of stealing almost £95,000 from Joan Killen's savings after Mr Reeve became a co-signatory for her accounts when her mental health began to deteriorate . After their arrests, the couple denied acting dishonestly and claimed they had been given permission by the woman to spend the money. Mr Bean said their victim had no close relatives visiting her and although her goddaughter was not a blood relative, she and her husband were in line to inherit almost all of her possessions anyway. But he told the jury it was ‘no coincidence’ that transfers back into the godmother’s account began only after the Reeves were told of the council investigation. The court also heard that within weeks of the woman being taken into temporary care, her home was stripped of a stairlift and warden alarms despite Mr Reeve being told she may return. The house was then let by the couple who had the rent and payment for utility bills paid directly into their accounts along with the elderly woman’s pension and winter fuel allowance. The Reeves deny four joint charges of theft. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Lesley, 56, and Andrew Reeve, 55, 'took advantage of her dementia'

The school where paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest seduced his 15-year-old victim has banned girls from wearing ‘figure hugging’ clothes or short skirts. Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, wants pupils to have the ‘highest standard’ of appearance, and banned make-up for girls below school year 10 - ages 14 to 15. Girls are banned from wearing underwear which is visible or skirts which are more than 2in above the knee - and pupils are not allowed to wear ‘figure hugging, tight, skinny-fitting styles’. Rules: The uniform guide which has been produced by Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest seduced his 15-year-old victim . There is no suggestion the rules were imposed as a result of Forrest's conviction for abduction and sexual activity with a child, which later saw the 31 year old jailed for five and a half years in June. A newsletter to all parents said the new guidelines will encourage pupils to ‘take pride in their appearance and their school’. It stated: ‘We strive for the highest standards in all aspects of school life and believe that pupils should take pride in their appearance and their school. ‘High standards of appearance are an important part of each pupil's sense of values and are a preparation for the world outside school. Guidelines: An example of the figure hugging clothes which have been banned. Girls are also banned from wearing underwear which is visible or skirts which are more than 2in above the knee . ‘Therefore, the school has a clearly . stated policy that all pupils are expected to wear full school uniform . both whilst journeying to or from school and, of course, on site. 'Figure hugging, tight, skinny-fitting styles, those with decorative buttons or chino look trousers are not acceptable' Bishop Bell Church of England School . ‘The . highest standards are maintained from the moment pupils enter the . school and parents are expected to support the policy with regard to . uniform.’ The letter includes a pencil portrait of a child with various parts 'tagged' with uniform guidance. It states that girls are not allowed to wear ‘coloured or patterned undergarments’ under their blouses which are visible. 'Highest standards': A newsletter from Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, to all parents said the new guidelines will encourage pupils to 'take pride in their appearance and their school' Nail varnish, body piercings and most items of jewellery were also deemed ‘not acceptable’. The guidelines state: ‘Figure hugging, . tight, skinny-fitting styles, those with decorative buttons or chino . look trousers are not acceptable. Teacher: Jeremy Forrest was jailed in June for child abduction and sexual activity with a child . ‘Trousers are required to be straight cut and are loose around the ankles without Lycra or similar stretch material.’ The school also issued strict rules on skirts, which should be: ‘No more than 5cm (2in) above the middle of the knee. ‘Skirts may be pleated or straight in style but should not have any Lycra or similar stretch material.’ All of the pupils at the school must wear a tie, blazer and white shirt or blouse. Boys are required to don plain black trousers while girls can choose between a smart trousers or a skirt. The school's management was unable to comment on the guidelines yesterday as they had broken up for the summer holidays. And an East Sussex County Council spokesman said they could not comment on individual uniform policies for schools. Forrest was jailed for child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child. His trial at Lewes Crown Court heard how he groomed the girl at school and first kissed her in a classroom. Fearing their affair would be exposed, the pair sparked a huge manhunt when then fled to France last September. But Forrest was eventually arrested in Bordeaux and extradited back to Britain.","Rules set by Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne .

One man is apparently left crying on his doorstep, while the faces of some children are pixilated to protect their identity – as happens with genuine documentaries. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversy: Marmite has triggered a 'hate it' backlash with a commercial that mimics animal cruelty TV documentaries . The premise is that these owners have neglected their Marmite which are then rescued by the pseudo RSPCA inspectors before the jars are re-homed. The manufacturer, which trades on the marketing slogan ‘Like It, Hate It, Just Don’t Forget It’, appears to have misjudged the response of viewers. After the commercial was seen during a break in Coronation Street on ITV on Monday night, the brand’s Facebook and YouTube page were hit with a critical backlash. Among the many Facebook complaints, one read: ‘Your new advert is very bad taste. Animal abuse is no laughing matter and I think it’s very wrong to jokingly use such a subject as a marketing scheme to increase your sales. Uniformed inspectors are seen raiding homes and shaming families to an emotive soundtrack from the BBC's much respected journalist and presenter Michael Buerk . The premise is that these owners have neglected their Marmite which are then rescued by the pseudo RSPCA inspectors before the jars are re-homed . Many animal welfare campaigners have hit back against the advert which they say makes a mockery of child cruelty . ‘People would be more inclined to buy Marmite if you donated a tiny percentage of each jars sale to the RSPCA to show that you meant no disrespect to the hard work that it does.‘ .

Hope you take this off air straight away!!!!’ The commercial was seen during a break in Coronation Street on ITV on Monday night .

Marmite apologised to those shoppers who were offended on its website, saying: ‘Sorry you feel that way.’ The manufacturer trades on the marketing slogan 'Like It, Hate It' It added: ‘The plot focuses on a fictitious world where teams of people are dedicated to salvaging unused jars and giving them to people who actually eat Marmite with the only animal that appears being a much-loved family pet. ‘We worked really hard to create an ad that we hoped people would watch in the light-hearted way it was intended.’ The RSPCA said it understood the concerns of some viewers. A spokesman said: ‘We understand that animal lovers are concerned on our behalf - people either love the advert or hate it.

An animal loving couple who adopted a one legged stray . dog from Romania are trying to raise nearly £4,000 - to buy her a set of . prosthetic limbs. Vanessa Bamkin and her husband Roger have taken in . four-year-old Glory as one of the family after seeing pictures of her on a dog . re-homing site on Facebook. Glory was living as a stray on the streets but was looked after by factory worker called Manuela Moncanu, who would feed her every day. Glory had to be re-homed by the charity that rescued her because they could not afford the specialist treatment and equipment that she needs to have a normal life . But when he went away for a week she was viciously attacked and had to . have her front legs and part of one of her back legs amputated. And although she has now settled into her new home in . Carlisle, Cumbria, Glory still struggles to get around and keep up with . Vanessa's three other dogs. The family believe that fitting her with prosthetic limbs . is the best way to give her a chance at a normal life, even though it could . cost as much as £4,000. Mrs Bamkin said she was moved to tears when she saw the . terrible condition Glory had been left in. She said:  ‘When I . saw all about Glory's situation on Facebook I was close to tears and I said to . my husband - we need to help her. ‘My husband was a bit more sceptical and thought it may . have been a scam - of course sending money to Romania is a giant leap of faith, . but it has been worth it to give Glory a new start.’ Transporting a dog from Romania to the UK is an expensive . and difficult process but the Bamkin family never wavered. Glory needed vaccinations and checks before she could . leave the country but donations came in from Holland, Germany and the UK and . 350 Euros were raised to pay for her passport and medical care. Vanessa and her husband picked up the bill for Glory to . travel the 1,887 miles in a sprinter van over three days from Bucharest to the UK . and she finally arrived with her new family just over a week ago. Glory was a stray in Romania but was looked after by factory worker called Manuela Moncanu who would feed her every day but when he went away for a week she was attacked . Since then Vanessa has wasted no time in trying to . improve Glory's life and the family are waiting to get her a wheely cart to . help her move around. Vanessa added: ‘She has learnt to walk on her front . stumps, similar to if we were to crawl on our elbows. ‘She has been incredibly brave and we want to help her . get around as normal.’ The Bamkins are currently saving up to buy her a . prosthetic back leg in order to help her balance on her wheels, but Vanessa . said her dream would be to pay for Glory to have three prosthetics, so she . could run around like other dogs. She said: ‘We will see how she gets on with the one . prosthetic leg but I am prepared to do all I can to help her. ‘The total cost of one prosthetic is £1365.33, but if we . were lucky enough to raise £3350, that would cover all three, and the mobility . that all three would give Glory would be incredible. New owners Vanessa and Roger Bamkin had to hire a sprinter van for three days to transport Glory the 1,887 miles from Bucharest to Carlisle . ‘I would love to be able to help Glory walk again and I . will save up if I have to.' Since Glory arrived in the UK Mrs Bamkin has set up a . donation page to try to raise funds from other animal lovers, and said that . people ‘have been so generous so far.’ Corina Ana, who co-ordinates the care and adoption of the . stray dogs in Romania, said it was important that Glory be re-homed because the . centre in her home country could not afford the specialist care she needed. She said: ‘I have been helping dogs to be re-homed . internationally for the past eight or nine months but Glory had the most major . handicap I had ever seen on a dog we have helped. ‘I am thrilled she has been adopted. We couldn't afford . to offer her a garden and a cart to help her walk so we thought the best thing . would be to put her up for adoption. ‘I am so pleased she has a family now who are looking after . her so well.’","Vanessa and Roger Bamkin first saw four-year-old Glory on a dog re-homing site on Facebook .

'Liar': Emmanuel Labram repeatedly told the patient that her tumour had been removed even though it was still there, the tribunal heard . A surgeon ‘lied and lied and lied’ to a woman with a brain tumour by claiming he had removed it, a tribunal heard yesterday. Emmanuel Labram told the woman he had successfully removed the entire growth when he had removed only a tiny sample for a biopsy. After lying to her he convinced her not to seek further treatment for two years after the operation by insisting she was absolutely fine. By the time the woman decided to seek private treatment for her problem, the lesion on her brain was inoperable. Yesterday a Medical Practitioners Tribunal hearing was told Mr Labram had repeatedly lied to the patient, identified as Patient A, after carrying out the operation at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in September 2008. Craig Sephton, QC, for the General Medical Council, told the hearing: ‘It is difficult to understand why Mr Labram initially told the patient and her husband that he had completely removed the lesion when he must have known that no such thing had happened. 'He then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure.’ The misconduct hearing was told that after lying to Patient A he forged and falsified documents and also lied to medical colleagues. Labram, 58, who qualified in Ghana in 1981, even sent letters to the patient’s GP telling him that no further treatment was necessary, it was said. The hearing in Manchester was told that Patient A had fallen ill on holiday in November 2007, experiencing double vision, and booked an appointment with her optician. She was then referred to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where an MRI scan revealed she had a tumour about one inch in diameter in her brain. The woman, who saw Labram to discuss her options for treatment in June 2008, told the hearing: ‘My first questions were, “Is it accessible? Is it operable?” and, “Is there anything you can do about it?” Surgeon: Emmanuel Labram treated the woman at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary - then repeatedly lied that her tumour had been removed . ‘He said, “Oh yes. That’s the only way to find out”, so I was confident the surgery would go well and I would find out what was causing the double vision.’ She added: ‘I was under the impression that he was going to remove the tumour.’ After the neurosurgeon operated in September 2008 he told her that he had removed 100 per cent of the tumour, she said. ‘He said, “It’s all gone”. He said it was just calcium deposits. That’s how he described it,’ she told the hearing. Mr Sephton said: ‘Mr Labram gave . Patient A’s husband a vivid description of how he had removed the . tumour. In fact he had not excised the lesion at all.’ The hearing was told that Labram had . removed only four tiny hard pale fragments when he knew the tumour was . an inch in diameter. In his medical notes he simply recorded that . ‘biopsies’ of the tumour had been taken. 'He . then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure . and the GMC will therefore invite you to conclude that is what has . happened' Craig Sephton QC, for the General Medical Council . Mr Sephton said there was no explanation as to why Labram had told the patient he had removed the entire tumour. ‘The only explanation is he was being dishonest,’ he said. ‘There is no clinical justification not to tell the truth to Patient A or her GP. Mr Labram acted dishonestly in asserting what he knew was not true.’ In January 2009 the surgeon is said to have altered a pathology report and sent a forged copy to his patient in order to conceal the fact she might need further treatment. Two months later he failed to tell Patient A that another MRI scan she had had showed the tumour was in fact unchanged. The GMC claims he did not tell her this because he wanted to conceal the fact he had not removed the lesion in the first place. Labram then changed his stance after a third MRI scan, telling Patient A and her GP that the lesion had returned, when he knew there had been no change. He again changed his tune in May 2010, now telling Patient A that he had not known the tumour was present when he operated on her and giving her another doctored pathology report, the panel heard. Patient A raised concerns about her treatment and the medical director at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary ordered an investigation. When asked about his actions in 2011, the surgeon allegedly continued to lie to bosses, claiming ‘he did not want to cause further stress to the patient’. ‘He was given the opportunity to come clean about the lies he had told and elected to not do so,’ said Mr Sephton. Labram, of Aberdeen, faces 11 allegations relating to his conduct. After a failed application to be voluntarily erased from the medical register, he withdrew from  proceedings and is not present or represented at the hearing. He is currently able to work within the UK subject to conditions that keep him closely monitored by a professional regulator. If found guilty of misconduct he could be struck off the medical register. The hearing continues.

They have been sentenced a total of 30 years in jail after using fake identities, secret bank accounts and fictitious illnesses to claim benefits. Scroll down for video . Barry Brooks, who insisted on being known as 'Sir Barry' and claimed he could barely walk, falsely claimed £1.8million after setting up a sham business pretending he was helping disabled people get work . Ministers vowed to use new technology and surveillance powers to ‘make it even tougher for these criminals’. The line-up includes a man who pretended to be in a wheelchair who claimed £1.8million in support for disabled employees at a company which did not exist, a horse breeder who claimed to be living alone who had an affluent lifestyle with her partner and pedigree dogs and a Liverpool football steward filmed hanging off a tree who claimed he could not work. In many cases cash, property and valuables have been seized to recoup some of the money claimed fraudulently. Welfare reform minister Lord Freud said: ‘Our fraud teams have the powers and technology to catch fraudsters, but we are determined to make it even tougher for these criminals. ‘With Universal Credit, benefit fraud will be harder to commit in the first place and easier to detect, and we are calling on the public to help with the crackdown. ‘We all know that it is a minority of people who try to commit fraud, but these criminals need to know, with the hardworking British taxpayer on our side, we are on their tracks.’ Fanta Sesay (left) was jailed for 28 months for a £400,000 fraud using fake IDs to work in an East London hospital while claiming benefits.

The European Parliament is to spend £6million on a 'youth camp' to promote Brussels days before crucial elections. Eurocrats are accused of ‘nothing short of bribery’ by organising the event for 5,000 16 to 30-year-olds ahead as voters prepare to go to the polls to elect new MEPs. The bizarre event includes role play games, concerts and ‘idea labs’ to debate youth unemployment in the European Parliament’s Strasbourg headquarters. Party venue: The European Parliament building in Strasbourg will host the Youth Camp next May, just weeks before Euro elections . The event has attracted controversy because it seeks to ‘strengthening a participative European democracy’ just before elections to the European Parliament in May 2014. Young people will be chosen by charities, youth groups and the Parliament’s offices across Europe. But more than 700 MEP will also be able to sponsor 10 young people each to send to the event, which it is claimed could breach rules on ‘treating’ voters during election time. The event, which is set to cost £1,200 per head, is linked to Europe Day and organisers hope to attract heads of state and ‘renowned personalities’ from across the continent. Tory MEP Martin Callanan said: ‘This is European Parliament largesse at its most breath-taking. ‘Sending impressionable young people on a taxpayer-funded trip a few days before an election is nothing short of bribery. ‘The European Parliament's authorities have really misjudged this idea.’ The extraordinary use of public funds comes after David Cameron declared war on EU waste, brandishing a colouring book at a summit which showed how it takes four Eurocrats to send a letter and depicting them travelling around town in taxpayer-funded limousines. The plans for the event on May 9-11 next year include a televised question and answer session with the candidates running to be President of the European Commission, meets with heads of state or governments and an open air concert. There will be a 'Youth Village' outside the European Parliament  and a street festival of cultural performances across Strasbourg. Stages will be erected for dance and sports performances. Role play games will allow young people to ‘step into the shoes of European decisionmakers, lobbyists or media-makers’. Waste: Prime Minister David Cameron has used repeated visits to Strasbourg and Brussels to call for an end to extravagant spending . There will also be a Debating Club competition and networking events based on ‘an adapted form of speed dating’. Mr Callanan added: ‘Young people want the EU to help them into work, not to fly a hand-picked selection to Strasbourg for a busman's holiday. ‘With 23 per cent of under 25s unemployed in the EU, I can think of many more useful things to spend this money on like training and apprenticeships. ‘At a cost per person of £1,200, this event will reinforce the view among British taxpayers that the European Parliament wastes their money. ‘These pet projects have to stop. The European Parliament's authorities have really misjudged this idea and should think again.

A civil servant who drew a picture of what his family did on January 1 has kept it up every day since - and now has a charming pictorial diary of his young family's day-to-day life. Instead of merely writing down what happened each day, Chris Wood, 42, accompanies each posting with jokey cartoons, many of them featuring his six-year-old son, Jack. The pen and ink drawings include Mr Wood working out how to use his satnav, Jack losing a tooth during a visit to the cinema, family birthdays, and trips to the seaside. Charming family record: Civil servant Chris Wood, 42, from Northwich, Cheshire, began drawing his family's day on January 1 this year, and has kept it up every day since . Happy family: Chris Wood often uses his six-year-old son, Jack, as the subject for the day's cartoons as he says such funny thing . The majority of his creations, made using pen and acrylic paint, featured Jack, riding his bike, eating his dinner or playing in the garden or going to Beavers. Other sketches show Jack on his Harry Potter style broomstick, splashing in the paddling pool and eating ice cream. Now his sketches are set to take the internet by storm after Mr Wood, who lives with his wife, Emma, 43, and son in Northwich, Cheshire, began posting his thoughts online. Until two years ago Mr Wood, who works in the communications department at Cheshire Police, had never had any art training and didn’t even study art at school or college. But he said he had always drawn in his spare time and, after starting a new sketch book on January 1 when he drew a picture of what he had been doing that day, he decided to keep going, and keep an illustrated diary for the whole year. Seven months in, he has not missed a day and said he may continue indefinitely as he has no wish to stop. Each entry features an expertly drawn sketch of a day in the life of himself, primary school teacher wife Emma, and Jack, along with his notes on what they have been doing. Mr Wood has had no real formal training, apart from a couple of drawing lessons he was given for his fortieth birthday two years ago, but is obviously talented . The pictures are accurate, even down to what each of them was wearing that day - Mr Wood says he often has to ask wife Emma, 43, what they were wearing . Mr Wood said: 'Drawing is something that I have always done but I never did anything with it. I never even studied art. 'A couple of years ago for my 40th birthday I was given some drawing lessons as a present, and it taught me basics that I didn’t even know about: palettes and colours. 'They said to me in those classes that I had a skill for drawing and it really encouraged me.' Having done a few commissions and sketches for friends, Mr Wood has now set up his own company, completing cartoons, comic strips, caricatures and portraits for weddings and birthday parties. The pictures often feature young Jack because he does and says funny things that make good cartoons his father can draw (once he's back from work, right) Mundane parts of family life such as the car making a strange noise and childish tantrums are chronicled in Mr Wood's cartoon diary . He said: 'On January 1 we went for a walk and I decided to draw a cartoon of what we’d been up to when we got back. 'It was after that that I thought about doing one the next day and keeping it as a diary. 'The cartoons focussed on my son because often he would have said or done something funny that I could draw. 'Since I started it’s developed a real style of its own and I'm really pleased with the way it has come out - of all of the drawings I've done, there have only been a couple that I am not happy with. 'I keep them true to life so even thought they are drawn from memory, I make sure that everyone has the clothes on that they were wearing during the day. 'I often have an idea before I start but sometimes I do have to shout to Emma to remind me what I’ve been doing. Mr Wood says he does the cartoons every night, although he once got behind by four days because the family was on holiday . The devoted father-of-one often uses Jack as his subject, whether it's an exciting birthday party or the youngster having a tantrum over his football kit . 'Jack has been good to focus on because he says the funniest things. And it helps to focus on him because otherwise some days it would just be about me driving to and from work. 'Now I want to keep going and I’m determined to do the full year. It is such a nice record for us as a family and there are so many thing that I’ve drawn that I would have just forgotten about.' Mr Wood uses moleskin sketch books for the work and has so far filled four as he completes his diary. Each is dated in the top left-hand corner and is drawn first in pencil, then pen, followed by a layer of thick brush pen before the top layer of acrylic paint is added. Nerf guns and Harry Potter films: Mr Wood's family diary shows the minutiae of family life in great detail, and will be a record of its time as well as their own memories . Happy family: Emma and Chris Wood and their son Jack now have a treasured pictorial record of their year so far . He said his works feature simple colours and always take just half an hour to complete 'including two cups of tea'. The father-of-one carries out his artwork in a spare room every night, although he said he once got four days behind after a holiday. He said he is now deciding what to do with his work, which he uploads to Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook where he is building a growing fanbase. He said: 'The work is quite personal but I am now wondering whether I should publish them. There has been a great reaction online and I enjoy the response. 'I’ve never kept a diary before but I am really starting to see why people do. I’ve really enjoyed it so far and it will be something to keep and look back on in the future.' Washing the car and enjoying some rare sunshine: The cartoon diary entries show day-to-day family life for the Woods at their home in Cheshire . Little Jack is unaware he is a literary star with a growing fanbase on his father's Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts . Touching family moments: The character of Mr and Mrs Wood's son comes out in the cartoons, whether he's happily eating pasta or kicking a football about . Chris Wood, seen left with his son Jack, has had no formal art training and works in a police communications team but is obviously a talented and skilled artist .","Civil servant Chris Wood, 42, draws a cartoon of family life with wife Emma, 43, and son Jack, six, every night .

Bernie Mulligan lost the use of her legs after being crushed by a car and has now launched an aromatherapy business after crediting it with helping her walk again . A woman who lost the use of her legs after being crushed by a car has launched a homemade aromatherapy business after crediting essential oils will helping her get back on her feet. Bernie Mulligan, 46, spent months in hospital after a driverless care rolled down a hill and trapped her against a gate post as she went to collect two of her daughters from school. Ms Mulligan lost the muscle in her legs because she spent so long in bed and when she tried to walk again, she collapsed. However, she says massages by her friend, and now business partner, Beverley Higham produced revolutionary results. Ms Mulligan, a mother of three, said they started an online business because doctors were so impressed by her speedy recovery. She said her achievement will inspire other people who have been injured or ill. The accident in 2001 left her with crushed ribs and spine, a split liver, and her lungs were punctured with broken bone. Ms Mulligan, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'The car's engine wasn't running so I didn't hear it and I was knocked out within a few seconds. 'Surprisingly it didn't hurt. It felt like someone patted me on the back. 'I was taken to hospital where there was a lot of blood. It's quite miraculous that I survived.' The former property management businesswoman was given emergency surgery to repair her lung, before spending months in hospital. She said: 'Because there was so much wrong with me, lots of different doctors were always coming to see me but I was on so much morphine I didn't really think about what was wrong with me. 'I lost all the muscle in my legs because I wasn't well enough to get out of bed so when I finally tried to walk, I just collapsed to the floor.' Ms Higham visited her friend in hospital . regularly and burned oil in the hospital room and massaged her legs . with essential oils. Ms Mulligan said: 'The oils have fantastic pain killing qualities and they smell wonderful. Ms Mulligan (pictured with her range of products) set up the online business with her friend Beverley Higham, who had visited her regularly in hospital to massage her wasted legs . Ms Mulligan said the homemade Potion Shop oils, which are blended at her house, have painkilling properties . 'I didn't know anything about oils before that but I could see how much they were helping me. 'The doctors couldn't believe how quickly I began to get back on my feet.' During her recovery, Ms Mulligan looked to keep her mind active and enrolled on an aromatherapy oil course to learn more about the potions that were helping her health and later did a degree in business management. She said: 'I didn't want to spend 30 hours a week giving someone a massage but I did want to learn more about the oils and their properties. 'The accident allowed me to do something I wanted to do. 'I was pushed into accountancy because I was good at Maths but I never really enjoyed it. 'I just want people . to see that no matter what they go through and how much it sets them . back, they can come out the other side and really do something they love . with their lives. 'I still can't run, but I can walk and swim and I enjoy my life so much more.' The range of alcohol and preservative-free creams so far includes a bracer (skin toner), facial oil and moisturizer, which are all blended at Ms Mulligan's home. Ms Higham, 50, a lecturer with more than 30 years' experience as a beauty therapist, said: 'It was the most natural thing in the world for Bernie and I to go into business together.

The president of Argentina has used her seat on the UN Security Council as an opportunity to blast Britain over the Falklands, comparing the dispute over the island to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner left leading diplomats and even the Secretary-General waiting for half an hour before she arrived late to yesterday's meeting. Argentina currently holds the presidency of the council - and though the position is not usually filled by a head of state, Mrs Kirchner used the opportunity to grandstand as she denounced the veto which leading powers wield over the powerful body. Rhetoric: Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner speaking at a UN security council meeting yesterday . Meeting: The Argentinian president arrived at the security council 25 minutes late yesterday . The outspoken president turned up at the meeting in New York 25 minutes late, forcing Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, 14 foreign ministers and dozens of diplomats to fill in time before her arrival. Once she arrived, Mrs Kirchner called for member states to implement UN resolutions immediately - singling out the Palestinian issue as well as a resolution for Britain and Argentina to negotiate over the future of the Falklands. Argentina claims that the UK is illegally occupying the islands, but the president insisted: 'This isn't caprice, it isn't saying we're right. 'We are just saying that we would like the UN resolution to be implemented, that both countries should sit down and discuss a controversial matter.' Handshake: Mrs Kirchner with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the meeting, which she chaired personally . However, British ambassador Mark Lyall Grant pointed out that residents of the Falklands had voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the UK in a March referendum. 'There can be no discussion on the sovereignty of the islands unless and until the islanders so wish,' he said. Mrs Kirchner said that the security council veto wielded by the U.S., UK, China, France and Russia was a Cold War relic which was intended to prevent 'nuclear holocaust'. She pointed out that the U.S. and Russia today sit at the same table, adding: 'We can't deal with the problems in this new world with old instruments and old methods because they're not going to be suited.' Russia and China have repeatedly vetoed security council resolutions designed to pressure Syrian president Bashar Al Assad to negotiate with opposition rebels, while the U.S. consistently vetoes measures aimed against Israel. Dispute: Mrs Kirchner took the opportunity to blast Britain over the Falkland Islands, pictured . Mrs Kirchner devoted much of the meeting to discussing ways that the UN can co-operate with regional organisations such as the Arab League and the African Union. Samantha Power, who was recently appointed as the U.S. ambassador to the UN, agreed that such organisations could help prevent atrocities but suggested that there were limits to how far they could bring countries together. Mrs Kirchner expressed serious concern at reports by NSA leaker Edward Snowden that a U.S. spy program is widely targeting data in emails and telephone calls across Latin America. She discussed the 'need to establish regulations of a global nature to ensure and protect sovereignty of states and privacy of citizens in the world.'","Argentinian president says the UK must comply with UN resolution calling for talks over the Falklands .

Thousands of schools will close for a day after unions  confirmed plans for a national strike next term. The National Union of Teachers and NASUWT are staging the walkout in protest at Michael Gove’s planned reforms which they describe as a ‘relentless attack’ on the profession. The strike will force many parents to take time off work to look after their children or pay for childcare. The unions, which have already held . industrial action in the North West, are planning two other regional . walkouts before the national action across England and Wales. Walkout: The NASUWT and NUT will stage industrial action across the country in October ahead of a national strike . The last nationwide one-day strike by . teachers was in November 2011 when members of several unions joined . other public sector workers in a walkout. In the current dispute the . teaching unions are fighting a government cap on pay and planned reforms . to pensions and workload. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates . said: ‘The Secretary of State needs to take seriously the very deep . concerns and anger of teachers and school leaders. ‘The relentless attack on the teaching profession is damaging the morale of teachers and undermining the education of pupils.’ NUT general secretary Christine Blower . added: ‘Strike action is always a last resort for teachers and they are . very well aware of the difficulties that this causes for parents and . pupils. Teachers, however, have been left no option. Education Secretary Michael Gove has warned lessons should not be disrupted . ‘If we do not take a stand now to . defend the profession then the consequences for teacher recruitment and . education will be disastrous.’ The unions, which represent 90 per . cent of teachers, oppose the 1 per cent pay rise imposed on public . sector workers and performance-related pay, which is being introduced . this year. They also claim members are being subjected to ‘oppressive . workloads’ and want plans to increase pension contributions to  be axed. The unions approved industrial action after ballots that were only supported by a minority of teachers. The first regional strike, in the . North West on June 27,  affected around 2,700 schools. The next round of . strikes will take place in the East, East Midlands, West Midlands, . Yorkshire, Humberside and parts of Wales in the week beginning September . 30. That will be followed by action in the . North East, London, South East, South West and Wales two weeks later. A . date has not been set for the national walkout. Mr Gove has met the . unions but insisted he will not change course. A Department for Education spokesman . said: ‘We are very disappointed that the NUT and  NASUWT have announced . they will be taking further strike action, which less than a quarter of . teachers actually voted for. ‘Industrial action will disrupt . pupils’ education, hugely inconvenience parents and damage the . profession’s reputation in the eyes of the public at a time when our . reforms are driving up standards across the country.’ Teachers used their annual conferences . in April to make demands including shorter working days and fewer . inspections. Votes of no confidence in Mr Gove were also passed. He responded by suggesting days should be longer and the length of terms increased. The Education Secretary has also . accused unions of reverting to a ‘1970s-style mentality’ with the . strikes and work-to-rule action that is already affecting about one in . ten schools.","NASUWT and NUT order industrial action across England Wales in October .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:19 EST, 4 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:49 EST, 5 July 2013 . A car company looking to gain an edge in the burgeoning ultra-high mileage commuter market hopes to do so by cutting corners. Or, wheels rather. Introducing Elio Motors, a startup vehicle manufacturer based in Michigan that hopes to get Americans plying the streets minus one wheel in skinny little cars that feature two in the front and just one in the back. Scroll down for video... Somethings missing: Meet the Elio, a three-wheeled car, the makers of which hope will change the way America commutes . And to do so, founder Paul Elio demanded his vehicle live up to four basic principles, reports MLive. First, the three wheeled car had to get at least 84 miles to the gallon on the highway. Second, it could cost no more than $6,800. It had to also receive a 5-star safety rating in spite of its size. Finally, Elio’s car had to be American made. Svelte: The 850-pound, two-seater car gets 84mph and costs less than $7,000, giving buys plenty of reasons not to miss a back tire . So far, the three-wheeled car has met those marks. Weighing in at 850 pounds, the Elio’s svelteness allows it to glide without the need for an SUV-sized fuel tank. And with five airbags, there’s little room in the skinny car to hit anything hard once they’ve deployed. Unfortunately, the car has lived up to its founder’s specifications only in the form of a few prototypes. Inspiration? The Elio mixes the compact size of the Smart car with the stability and maneuverability of the Can-Am Spyder cycle (left) The Elio has yet to undergo federal crash test rating. That along with some other red tape means the prototypes—which have so far emerged painted shades of silver, black, white, blue, orange (called creasicle), red and bright green—aren’t street legal. But Elio’s representatives have been happy to take industry insiders out for a spin. Soon to come: The car is slated to start being made in Louisiana next summer and interested buyers can put down deposits now. The higher the deposit, the quicker they'll get their Elio . And Elio’s vice president of marketing Chip Stempeck will soon be touring Michigan cities in an Elio. According to Stempeck, interested buyers can put down deposits in varying increments, sort of like a Kickstarter campaign. The larger the deposit, the sooner the buyer will get his or her Elio once production begins.

Motorists have won a landmark judgement after the High Court ruled it illegal for a cash-strapped council to hike parking charges as a revenue-raising stealth ‘tax’ to subsidise its other services. Motoring groups said the ruling was ‘fantastic news’ which had major implications for millions of drivers because it would stop local authorities across the country ‘picking on drivers’ to fill their empty coffers by imposing similar illegal parking ‘taxes’. A High Court judge ruled Barnet council in north London acted unlawfully when it increased the cost of residents' parking permits and visitor vouchers in controlled parking zones (CPZs) to raise revenue. Objectors complained that the increases had made parking in Barnet's quiet residential streets 'more expensive than parking outside Harrods' and were ‘picking the pockets’ of residents'. Fight: Barnet resident David Attfield led the legal action against the council's unfair parking charges . They argued that around 10 per cent of Barnet residents, who lived in CPZs, were heavily subsidising transport services for the whole borough and that the parking hikes were designed by the council to fund expenditure on road maintenance, subsised concessionary fares and other road transport costs. Mrs Justice Lang  agreed, declaring at London's High Court that the 1984 Road Traffic Regulation Act ‘is not a fiscal measure and does not authorise the authority to use its powers to charge local residents for parking in order to raise surplus revenue for other transport purposes’. The judge ruled that Barnet had misinterpreted the law when it concluded that it was lawful for the council 'to budget for a surplus (of parking charges) at any level which it considered appropriate in order to generate income for other transport purposes which it wished to fund.' Residents in the borough had originally faced residential parking charges of £20 for a first car and 35p each for visitor vouchers. Those charges were increased in 2006 to £40 and £1. But in 2011 they soared to £100 and £4 - among the highest controlled parking zone charges in London. The ruling is believed by experts to be . the first successful legal challenge against the level of parking . charges set by a local authority. It could see thousands of Barnet . residents reclaim millions of pounds in unlawfully collected charges. Campaign: Barnet CPZ Action group led the fight against the council . More significantly it could lead to many more legal challenges and prevent similar actions. Professor Stephen Glaister is director of the RAC Foundation which had given evidence backing the residents. He said: ‘Our position has now been vindicated. ‘This is fantastic news for drivers. The law is explicit - parking charges are about managing congestion, not raising revenue. 'If there is a surplus collected then there are strict rules on what it can be used for. Why did Barnet ever think it had an arguable case to pick on one group of residents to shoulder an additional tax?’.’ Professor Glaister said he had some sympathy with cash-strapped councils, but added: ’But we have no sympathy for attempts to make up the shortfall by arbitrarily picking on drivers. That view has now been backed by the courts. ‘Councils thinking of turning to motorists to balance the books would do well to read the judgement and put their heads back below the parapet. This ruling will be felt by hundreds of local authorities and benefit millions of drivers.’ The ruling was achieved by the Barnet CPZ Action group, made up of residents from the borough, including solicitor David Attfield, who brought the lead case. Mr Attfield, from East Finchley, won the quashing of the council's decision in February 2011 to dramatically increase the charges with effect from April 2011. The judge rejected arguments put forward by council lawyers that it had powers under section 45 of the 1984 Act to raise a surplus from parking charges for transport functions. There were no parking charges in Mr . Attfield's quiet residential road until the Controlled-Parking Zone CPZ . was first introduced in 2001 to prevent tube commuters parking in local . streets. The judge . ordered the council to repay the parking charges unlawfully obtained . from Mr Attfield, plus his legal costs, opening the way for other . residents to seek their money back. The . judge formally rejected Barnet's application to appeal against her . ruling, but the council can still ask the Court of Appeal to hear the . case. Mrs Justice Lang said her orders against Barnet would be stayed . until the appeal court makes a decision. Unfair: The cash-strapped council put the cost of permits up by up to 300 per cent to raise money for other projects . Mr Attfield, a 46-year-old father of two, said after his victory: ‘Barnet Council has been caught picking the pockets of residents. They were being made to contribute disproportionately to a range of services such as road repairs and the provision of bus passes across the borough. 'Simply holding a summer BBQ or a children's party could cost £40 in parking charges. An elderly person enjoying regular visits from a relative could face an annual cost of £800. ‘Today's judgment confirms that . Parliament never intended local authorities to take a large cut every . time a book club meets, mums get together for coffee or a washing . machine is repaired.’ It . was regrettable that Barnet spent more than two years, and tens of . thousands of pounds defending actions ‘which they should have known were . legally and morally wrong,’ he said. Mr . Attfield's solicitor, Andrew Brookes, a partner at London law firm . Anthony Gold, said his client stood to gain just £120 rebate and was not . motivated by money: ‘He was motivated by this being a matter of . principle and his concern for all the people who could clearly not . afford this astronomical hike in fees.’ He . added: 'It is a tribute to David's commitment and tenacity that he was . not prepared to give up as he encountered many bureaucratic or legal . obstacles along the way. This ruling now clearly proves that Barnet . Council, rather than funding parking through its fees, as the Government . intended when it passed the law, was raising money for illegitimate and . unlawful purposes.’ Barnet council leader, Richard . Cornelius, conceded that the increase in charges had been carried out . ‘too abruptly and rather charmlessly’, but said there would be an . appeal. Targeted: Residents who lived in the controlled parking zones around Barnet High Street had to pay the 'stealth tax' to the council . Brandon Lewis, Minister for Local Government, said: ‘This Government has been very clear that parking charges are not, and should not be, a town hall stealth tax on local residents. We have scrapped the Labour Government's guidance which pressured councils to hike up parking charges. Indeed, making sure that car parking charges are reasonable is an important way in which councils can help support their local high streets and local shops.’ Some councils have also been criticised for appearing to use cash raised from on-street parking and fines to subsidise other services.  Any which are found to be doing so may also face legal challenges on similar grounds. The RAC Foundation noted: ‘No on-street charges can be levied to raise revenue . ‘The power to make charges for parking is defined by law to be for “relieving or preventing congestion of traffic”. ‘There are also more general powers to manage parking for safety and amenity but these do not also permit charging.’ It said: ‘The law is quite clear that local authorities may only impose charges for controlling congestion. They have no power to impose charges in order to raise money for any other purpose.’ Currently Barnet residents can buy two types of visitor vouchers for friends or tradespeople needing to park near their homes. A book of 12 ‘half-day’ vouchers, which last up to four hours,  and . costs £26.40 – averaging £2.20 each or a book of 12 all-day vouchers . which costs £49.92, averaging £4.16 each.","Barnet residents' parking permits soared up to 300 per cent in cost .

A lorry driver who admitted sending texts at the wheel killed a mother-of-one when he crashed into her car while speeding. Jasvinder Arora, 44, was jailed for three and a half years yesterday after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. The lorry driver admitted he had made two calls and sent and received text messages as he drove his articulated truck at 55mph - 5mph above the speed limit for his vehicle - on the A14 near Ipswich, Suffolk. Write caption here . Moments later he ploughed into Carmen Bucur's Vauxhall Corsa, which was being towed at around 10 to 15mph by a Ford Transit van after it had broken down. Ms Bucur, 33, was killed in the crash and her friend in the passenger seat Maricica Racu broke five ribs. They had both been sitting in the car as it was towed, Ipswich Crown court heard. Ms Bucur, who has a seven-year-old daughter, had only arrived in the UK six days before the crash on May 10 last year. She was working as a cleaner and sending money back to her family in her native Romania. She and her friend had plans to start their own cleaning business and were on their way to an appointment with a potential employer when their car broke down. It was not known whether Arora, who had a Bluetooth device in his cab, was using his phone when he crashed, the court was told.

Collision: The crash happened on the A14 near Ipswich in Suffolk . 'In those seconds for whatever reason he doesn't appear to have spotted the hazard in front of him,' he said. He accused the lorry driver of 'gross inattention' and said that the phone calls had caused him to stop focusing on the road. 'Whatever the subject matter of the . telephone calls was, that's where his mind was rather than concentrating . on the road ahead of him,' he added. Arora, from Feltham, west London, admitted causing death by careless driving but was convicted of the more serious offence of causing death by dangerous driving. Giving evidence during the trial, he said he had 'misjudged' the situation and had only seen the Corsa when he was 60ft away. Although he admitted making the calls and sending messages, he denied he was distracted.

On trial: Nicole Baukus is facing two charges of vehicular homicide after driving the wrong way up a Texas highway. Her trial began this week . Footage from a Texas bar shows a 23-year-old woman consuming 21 drinks before she drove home the wrong way down a highway, killing two teenagers in a head-on crash. Nicole Baukus, from Spring, is facing up to 60 years in prison if found guilty of two counts of vehicular homicide and one count of vehicular assault. A court was told this week that Baukus drank four bottled beers and 21 'shooters', or spirit mixers, in about four and a half hours, before getting in her pick up truck and causing the fatal crash. Prosecutors at her trial this week showed video footage of Baukus drinking at the On the Rox sports bar and of her pick up truck traveling the wrong way down a highway in Conroe, on June 29, last year. As an emergency physician who attended to the two victims in the crash testified to their grievous injuries, Baukus broke down in court Wednesday -- so much so that a 10 minute recess was called. District Court Judge Michael T. Seiler then warned her not to repeat the behavior. 'We can’t have that kind of disruption,' he said. She is accused of crashing head on into a car being driven by Nicole Adams, killing the 19-year-old and her back seat passenger, Travis Sanders, 18, according to KHOU News. A third passenger, 21-year-old David Porras, was seriously injured in the crash, which happened just before 3am. In court yesterday, prosecutors played emergency calls from other drivers as they reported seeing a pick up truck traveling the wrong way. Crushed: The wreckage of the car Nicole Adams was driving when she was hit and killed by the pick up truck . Fatal: Another angle of the late Nicole Adams' car shows the sheared off roof. Adams' passenger Travis Sanders was also killed . On year later: The first day of the trial over the summer 2012 crash finally began this week. Baukus, center, is seen here at the proceedings . Before police could stop Baukus, the . fatal collision took place. An hour after the crash her blood-level . alcohol was more than three times the legal limit. Prosecutors also . claim she had drugs in her system. Texas . Alcoholic Beverage Commission agent Oscar Williams told the court . Baukus had consumed beer and shooters at On the Rox, from 9:19pm to . 1:46am. He said that a . tray of shooters was seen being delivered to her table just after . midnight, which violated the Texas commission's rules, according to The Courier of Montgomery County. Deadly: Baukus is accused of slamming headlong into Adams' car, pictured, causing two deaths and critically injuring 21-year-old David Porras . Baukus is charged with two counts of intoxication manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault. She pleaded not guilty on all counts . Crime scene: The pick up truck allegedly driven the wrong way up a highway by Nicole Baukus . Trashed: Debris littered the Texas highway around the accused woman's car . 'Only two open beverages can be sold to one customer at a time,' he said. In April the bar agreed to a $1 million settlement for Mr Porras, who is still having surgery from injuries caused in the crash, and to the estate of Miss Adams and Mr Sanders. Porras has had 13 operations since the accident and has no teeth in his upper jaw after the bone was smashed when he hit the dashboard. Put away? If convicted, Baukus would likely have to serve at least half her time before parole is even considered . Busted: Baukus' car after the deadly June 2012 crash. Prosecutors say she is on video taking 17 shots and drinking four beers prior to the crash . Emotions high: Baukus broke down as a physician who attended to the two victims testified Wednesday and was admonished by the judge . Serious charges: Baukus' truck following the June 29, 2012 accident. Prosecutors in the case are trying to prove the truck was a deadly weapon, which would make her ineligible for parole until at least half her sentence is served . Survivor: The surviving passenger of Nicole Adams' car, David Porras, now has no teeth in his upper jaw and has undergone 13 operations since the crash . Baukus' trial is expected to last five days. She faces decades behind bars if convicted . Wasted: An hour after the crash that left two dead and one grievously injured, Baukaus' blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit . The bar was sued for violating the . Texas Dram Shop Liability Act, which provides a cause of action against . any bar that serves an obviously intoxicated adult, the Villager reported. At . her vehicular manslaughter trial, prosecutor Andrew James told the . court: 'As the trooper was questioning her, he noticed she would just . randomly be laughing at times, like this was all one big joke.' Baukus denies the charges, according to Montgomery County Police Reporter. The trial is expected to last five days.

Its boot may be smaller than the average suitcase, but this baby-faced Aston Martin took up every inch of its baggage allowance to take a trip aboard a Boeing 777 passenger airliner. The new £30,000 city runaround, named the Cygnet by the luxury motor brand, was flown by special command on an Emirates Airlines aircraft from Glasgow Airport to Cyprus in time for the birthday celebrations of a wealthy customer. Most of us wince when we find out our baggage is a few kilograms over the airline's allowance, but for this customer, the additional charge would have come to almost £10,000. However, they went through Emirates SkyCargo because it was the cheapest and quickest way to get the car transported and was charged based on the airline's cargo rates. Tight squeeze: This was the first time a car had been squeezed into the hold of an Emirates SkyCargo plane leaving Glasgow . The vehicle weighs 988kg, according to the Aston Martin website. So at £10 per every extra kilogram for checked in baggage over and above the 30kg limit, the client would have forked out £9,580 to put this large piece of luggage in the Emirates hold. The lavishly appointed supermini – which . bears the car company’s famous winged badge – was carefully strapped . onto an Emirates SkyCargo plate and was the first car to have been transported in the hold of one of the airline’s twice-daily 777 jets flying out of Glasgow. Like a scene almost from a James Bond movie, the car, believed to be a gift, was carefully manoeuvred into place in the baggage hold of the passenger jet before setting off for Dubai last week before travelling on to Cyprus. It eventually arrived safely at its destination 48 hours after take-off. Phil Rawlings, UK cargo manager for Emirates SkyCargo, said yesterday: ‘The Cygnet certainly stood out from the other plates at our Glasgow SkyCargo warehouse, especially as it is the first time a car has flown on our Glasgow flight.’ The shipper of the Aston Martin, Michael Howard-Johnston of motor retailer CyprusCars.eu, said his company had been concerned that completing the shipment on time would have proved too tall an order, until he contacted Emirates SkyCargo. The brand new £30,000 city runaround, named the Cygnet by the luxury motor brand, is taxied out to its flight . The lavish cargo, complete with flight document details on its windscreen, was first strapped down onto a metal pallet . It was then positioned next to the enormous SkyCargo plane ready to be raised up into the hold . Mr Howard-Johnston added: ‘Without them, this shipment could not have been delivered on time. ‘Emirates promised to deliver it in a matter of days and were the only ones who could do so. Flying it out of Glasgow Airport also saved us the time and inconvenience of further land transport. ‘The Aston Martin Cygnet is a fantastic little car and Emirates have transported her efficiently and with great care.’ Regarded as one of the funkiest city cars in production, the Cygnet is identical to the £13,000 Toyota iQ, but has a deluxe interior and a premium £30,995 price tag. Aston Martin has also remade every body panel except the roof. The Cygnet shares the distinctive bright aluminium grille of the £1million One-77 model and the leather interior is all hand-stitched. And while the 777 which transported her was belching out CO2, the supermini was developed to cut the Aston car fleet’s average CO2 emissions below the 130g/km level where it would have incurred hefty EU fines. The lavish miniature Aston Martin just about fitted into the plane's cargo compartment and was delivered to its customer in Cyprus within 48 hours . Despite the price tag and its ‘jet-set’ associations, the Cygnet is by far the smallest and slowest car in the Aston Martin range. It shares the same 1.33-litre engine, chassis and gearbox as its Toyota parent, achieving a top speed of 107mph and 0-62mph in 11.6 seconds. However, it can boast far better fuel economy than the thirsty grown-up cousins favoured by James Bond, returning 54.3mpg and relatively healthy CO2 emissions of 116 g/km. The Emirates Airliner B777-300 was able to swiftly transport the special gift to its customer . Last leg: It took just 48 hours for the brand new vehicle to be transported from Glasgow to its final destination in Cyprus, via Dubai, for a special gift .","The miniature Cygnet model just squeezed into an Emirates SkyCargo plane .

A bus driver who spends every day behind the wheel is unable to drive his own car - because he can't afford the insurance. Tim Clarke, 19, has a clean driving licence and thousands of hours of driving experience under his belt. But Mr Clarke claims he is one of many young drivers being forced off the road by 'astronomical' insurance fees after he was quoted up to £5,000 to insure a car. Young driver: Tim Clarke, 19, works as a qualified bus driver but is still being quoted between £3,000 to £5,000 to ensure a 1.3 Suzuki Jimny because of his 'lack of road experience' Unlike most drivers his age, he has passed an independent bus driving test and has a Certificate of Professional Competence, but he says insurers don't take that into consideration. When he tried to insure a Suzuki Jimny 1.3, he was quoted between £3,000 and £5000 - the same price as the car he hopes to buy. Direct Line refused to insure him at all because of his lack of road experience. Mr Clarke, who lives with his parents in Droylsden, said: 'I earn £15,000 a year, so I just can't afford that on top of everything else. 'It feels like they need to start taking into account driving qualifications and skills and not just look at your age and think ""this guy's going to be a delinquent teenager and we've got to hike up the price for him"". Off the road: Tim Clarke says he can't afford to pay the high insurance costs and will wait until he has had his licence for longer before reapplying . 'I have to rely on my parents to take me everywhere - or get the bus.' Mr Clarke started his job in January, driving 26 different routes across north Manchester. He added: 'I'm definitely better than most drivers, but they just look at the statistics. 'I'm going to wait until I've had my licence for a year and try again, but I shouldn't have to do that.' Vicky Tomlinson, Mr Clarke's manager at the First bus depot in Manchester said: 'Tim is one of more than 1,500 highly trained bus drivers serving in the communities of Greater Manchester. Like all our drivers, Tim has gone through a six-week training programme covering driving and customer service and we're pleased with the way he has taken to the role.' A spokesman for Direct Line said: 'Young drivers make up only eight per cent of licence holders, but are involved in 25 per cent of road deaths and serious injuries. 'This is the primary reason why young drivers have always paid higher car insurance premiums. For the average driver, around 20 different rating factors are used to determine their individual price for car insurance. 'The most influential of these are: age, driving experience, postcode, No Claims Discount, a driver's previous claims history and if they have any driving convictions. 'Even if a young person drives for their job and has less than a year's experience, they will still be determined as a higher risk than an older driver.'","Tim Clarke has a clean driving licence and Certificate of Professional Competence as well as thousands of hours of driving experience .

This week it was revealed that increasing numbers of childless women are signing up to 'natural insemination' websites - online meeting places that put women who want sperm together with men who want sex. Despite the obvious risks it has been suggested that women are turning to the sites because of the soaring cost of IVF, which can be up to £2,000 per cycle using donor sperm. But does that mean having unprotected sex with a stranger in order to have a baby - who will never know its father - any more acceptable? Many, including parenting expert Kelly Rose Bradford, believe getting pregnant this way will always be wrong - from a moral and a health standpoint. But journalist Sally Windsor believes that women should be allowed to get pregnant in any way they wish. Appearing on This Morning, Sally admitted she has even gone one further with her thought process - once writing of her plans to trick a stranger into getting her pregnant should motherhood not have happened to her in time. Scroll down for video . Controversial: The debate gets underway with Windsor (right) in favour and Bradford (left) against . The debate, which took place on ITV breakfast show This Morning, provoked strong reactions, with Windsor blasting women who 'sit around' and wait for Mr Right as 'archaic'. Windsor admitted that while she did not go through with plans to trick a stranger into impregnating her, she still stands by the idea. 'Sitting back and waiting to become a parent is archaic,' she argued. There's no point in sitting around and waiting for it [parenthood] to happen to you.' Asked by Phillip Schofield why she did not have the planned one night stand she said: 'My circumstances changed. I've got my little girl, my house... so it just didn't happen.' Windsor shot to fame last year when she wrote an article headlined: 'I'll trick a stranger into giving me another child: A single mother who's desperate to be pregnant again, confesses all...' In the piece, which appeared in the Daily Mail, Windsor wrote: 'I have decided to find a man to provide a second child for me. 'The transaction will be an uncomplicated one: he will sleep with me - once, if my plan works out - and I will become pregnant. Family: Sally Windsor with daughter Ruby (left) and Karen Rose Bradford with her son William (right) 'And that is where his paternal duty will end. There will be no rights or obligations on his part: no access visits, no calls on his time and attention; and he will have no financial involvement in the child’s upbringing whatsoever.' During the interview, she revealed that the support she got in the wake of the piece was phenomenal and said that it 'made it even more apparent that it [natural insemination] does go on all the time.' 'What is difference between one night stands and natural donation?' she added. 'I wouldn't trick anyone. The actual . story was more that if someone pulled me up on it, I'd admit it. But if . woman goes into bar and isn't actively deceiving the man then there's no problem.' Horrified, Kelly Rose Bradford riposted: 'Everyone knows that [unplanned] pregnancies do happen but I would expect most women to do their utmost to tell the man what has happened. 'The problem with websites like these is that they reduce having a baby to scouring the internet for sperm. I would also ask why men are doing it? For sex?' Not true, says Windsor, who said that she had discovered that some would-be natural inseminators genuinely want to help out. Heated: Things got a bit tense when Sally Windsor got into an argument with Phillip Schofield . 'Some men genuinely . want to provide sperm and just want to see life go on,' she said. 'They don't want responsibility for the child, so this is right for them.' But for Bradford, having sex with a stranger purely to get pregnant is nothing more than 'no-strings sex'. 'We grew up with messages about the dangers of having unprotected sex,' she explained. 'At least if it's with your partner, you know what you're getting into.' In response to Windsor, who likened it to normal sperm donation, she added: . 'I think if you go to an organisation, then it's very . different from picking someone up. And what if you later meet someone and have . children with them? 'You have a child with no idea who they really are and you can't exactly tell them what really happened [when they were conceived]. 'It's very different to deliberately go into situation that could put your health or life at risk.'","Sally Windsor and Kelly Rose Bradford appeared on ITV's This Morning .

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond warned of the damage that uninsured drivers do to honest motorists . More than £5million worth of fines have been collected from uninsured drivers over the last two years, new figures reveal today. And nearly 2,500 uninsured vehicles are seized by police each week. The figures cover the period since a change in the law to bring in Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE). Ministers say uninsured drivers are a serious danger killing 130 people and injuring 26,500 every year while pushing up the insurance premiums of innocent law-abiding drivers. The AA estimates that uninsured . drivers cost Britain at least £380million every year and add about £33 . to the cost of every car insurance policy. About . a million people – or one in 36 of all vehicle owners – are estimated . to be without insurance, says the Government-backed Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB) which compiled the latest figures. Under . Continuous Insurance Enforcement, the DVLA’s records of vehicle keepers . are systematically matched with the insurance record on the Motor . Insurance Database (MID), which is the central record of all insured . vehicles in the UK. The new . report said £5.1 million in fixed penalties and court fines have now . been collected from the tens of thousands of owners who have admitted or . been found guilty of being uninsured to drive. The Motor Insurers’ Bureau report said: ’Police powers to seize vehicles on the road for no insurance coupled with Continuous Insurance Enforcement are making a significant contribution to reducing uninsured driving in the UK and have contributed to a 40per cent reduction in the level and impact of uninsured driving. ‘ . ‘It is estimated that uninsured drivers kill 130 people and injure 26,500 every year but more still needs to be done.’ Ashton West, Chief Executive of the Motor Insurers’ Bureau, said: ‘There is no let-up in the efforts to catch those people who have no insurance for their vehicle. 'The Motor Insurance Database is a powerful tool for enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal motorists and reduce the very real and significant impact of uninsured driving. ‘Whether it’s a fixed penalty or your vehicle being seized, we are seeing the continued benefits of having a central database that the Police and DVLA can use to enforce the law. This is good news for all honest motorists.’ The new report revealed £5.1 million in fixed penalties and court fines have now been collected from the tens of thousands of owners who have admitted or been found guilty of being uninsured to drive . Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond . said: ‘Uninsured drivers are a danger on our roads. They push up . premiums for other motorists and often drive with no regard for other . road users, so it is vital that we do everything we can to keep them off . the roads. 'That is why we introduced Continuous Insurance Enforcement, which is an excellent example of government and the private sector working together for the benefit of the honest motorist.' Mr Hammond said: ’The action taken in the last two years has helped reduce the number of uninsured drivers and we will continue to work closely with the motor insurance industry to tackle this important issue.’ The Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB) sends advisory letters to the owners of vehicles that appear to have no insurance. Recipients of these initial warning letters -  who may be unaware of the change in law - are given a range of options to avoid enforcement action. These include the vehicle off the road (Statutory Off Road Notification), getting properly insured, or contacting their insurer to make sure that their insurance record has been correctly uploaded to the database. The AA estimates that uninsured drivers cost Britain at least £380million every year and add about £33 to the cost of every car insurance policy . Officials said the new system is having ‘a positive impact’ noting: ‘Collectively hundreds of thousands more vehicles have been correctly recorded on the Motor Insurers’ Database helping motorists avoid the inconvenience of having to prove their vehicle is insured. ‘Illegal  drivers are being automatically identified and prosecuted and our roads are safer as a result.’ It said: ’Every hour, 1,200 people check that their vehicle is recorded on the database and that they are compliant with the change in law. At the same time insurers are continuously updating motor polices with 12,000 changes made every hour.’ It added: ‘On average the public make two million enquiries of the Motor insurers’ Database every month when renewing their tax disc. In addition to using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, the Police make 1.8 million enquiries to the MID every month to check a vehicle’s insurance status. Between 3,000 and 4,000 calls are also made every week to the Motor Insurers’ Bureau  dedicated police helpline to seek assistance in validating a vehicle’s insurance status before determining what action to take.","Ministers say uninsured drivers kill 130 people and injure 26,500 every year .

A six-year-old girl has made a remarkable recovery after surgeons cut off her arm to remove a cancerous tumour - before successfully sewing it back on. Incredibly, after Bethan Evans’ left arm was ‘temporarily’ amputated it was driven three miles to another hospital where specialists treated the golf ball-sized tumour with high-doses of radiation. A team of 10 medics then sewed her arm - which had been cut off at the shoulder - back on again at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham. Bethan Evans (pictured with her mother, Lynne) had Ewing's sarcoma - a rare chilldhood cancer of the bones and tissue - which caused a large tumour to grow in her left arm . Bethan, from Welshpool, in Powys, underwent the eight-hour procedure on July 5 last year, six months after she was struck down with Ewing's sarcoma - a rare bone and tissue cancer. Since the operation she has undergone months of physiotherapy to strengthen her arm and she is now looking forward to returning to school next month. Her mother, Lynne, 37, a teacher, said: ‘She had a virus before Christmas, she never was a poorly child before cancer. ‘She came out in a rash and I couldn’t control her temperature so I took her to the doctors who told me it was a virus, which in his defence it was. ‘She couldn’t shake it and had about six weeks off poorly and stayed on the sofa. ‘Then a lump appeared in the middle of her left arm and I knew it wasn’t a break or anything like that because she hadn’t been doing anything. Bethan's left arm was temporarily amputated and driven three miles to another hospital where specialists treated the golf ball-sized tumour with high-doses of radiation . Bethan was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma on January 30, 2012. She underwent eight weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink the tumour in her arm. Six months later, she was admitted to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham. Surgeons removed her arm at the shoulder and packed it in ice. It was transported by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Here, the tumour was zapped with high doses of radiation to kill the cancer cells before it was removed from her arm. The arm was then returned to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital where it was reattached. Bethan required intensive physiotherapy to regain the movement in her arm. ‘I said to my husband it was cancer and he said I was talking nonsense. ‘When we were told it was cancer we held it together until we got to the car and I just wanted to go home, I was distraught. ‘When the doctors told us the surgeons would remove her arm we were shocked, we couldn’t believe it. ‘As a parent you want to protect your children but we were being told the only way to remove the cancer was to amputate her arm, have it driven across a city to another hospital before being driven back and sewn back on. ‘We didn’t want to scare Bethan so we told her that she was having a sleep, which she got used to, and we told her when she woke up her lump, we didn’t say cancer, would have gone.’ She added: ‘We were terrified enough . and that is all we told her, after the operation and when she recovered . we told her and she said it was great, she said it was cool. ‘She isn’t bothered about showing her scar now, but protects it and doesn’t let people hold her arm, just me or her dad. ‘She wants to be a nurse now when she is older and I hope she can do that.’ Bethan, who was only told about the . details of her operation afterwards, said: ‘When mum and dad said the . doctors cut my arm off I just thought “that’s cool”. ‘I now think of it as my special arm. I’m really looking forward to skipping with my friends again when I get back to school. ‘I really want to be a nurse when I grow up. It’s cool what they do.’ Her arm was removed at the shoulder at Birmingham's Royal Orthopaedic Hospital and packed in ice before being taken by ambulance to the city's Queen Elizabeth Hospital . The arm was then returned to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital where it was reattached. The whole procedure took eight hours and Bethan has since required intensive physiotherapy to regain movement in the arm . Bethan was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - which affects around 30 children in the UK each year - on January 30 last year, her fifth birthday, after her parents noticed a lump on her arm. Before her operation Bethan underwent eight weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink the tumour which measured 17cm in diameter. On the day of the operation, surgeons at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham removed her arm at the shoulder. The arm was then packed in ice before being rushed by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham which specialises in radiation therapy. A team of doctors put the arm through intense radiation to kill any existing cancer cells before removing the tumour. Hours later the arm was then re-packed in ice and sped back across the city where it was re-attached to Bethan. Her mother said: ‘It was all a blur. My husband and I sat in the ambulance with Bethan’s arm as it was rushed across Birmingham by ambulance. Bethan was diagnosed with cancer after suffering from a virus which caused her to develop a fever and rash. Her mother then noticed she had a lump in her arm. Image shows an X-ray of her arm since it was reattached . ‘We are just delighted the treatment was successful. Bethan might be cancer free now but she will not get the all clear for another four years. ‘It has been a rollercoaster journey and we couldn’t be prouder of Bethan. She has gone through so much for such a little girl but she has never stopped smiling.’ Bethan has weekly physiotherapy sessions and could have a platinum bone inserted into her upper arm when she turns nine if she struggles to move it. Mrs Evans added: ‘She has no feeling in the top of her arm, her bones are dead, but the lower arm is fine, you wouldn’t know anything is different, she’s lost about 30 per cent mobility but she can have 85 per cent mobility if she has an operation when she is nine. Bethan (pictured with her mother, Lynne) has now been declared cancer-free but she will have to have regular follow up scans until she is 18 . Bethan is hoping to return to school full-time in September. She says that she thinks the fact her arm was removed and reattached is 'cool' ‘We still have to do a lot for her, teaching her basic things like getting dressed and eating because I have done it for her for the last 18 months. ‘She’s been to school periodically during her treatment but you’re talking one or two days. ‘I hope she will go full time in September. She can’t wait to play with the other kids.’ Bethan will have routine follow up scans at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Birmingham Children’s Hospital every three months until she is 18. Since her treatment, Bethan (pictured playing with her sister Amy, eight), has decided that she wants to be a nurse when she grows up . Her mother, and father, Arwel, 38, are now raising money for the Kids Cancer Charity in a bid to help other children. Arwel, an engineer, is preparing for a 220-mile sponsored bike ride from Holyhead to Cardiff next month to raise money for the charity. He said: ‘I can’t put into words how proud we are of both of our children and the family to be honest, we have all worked as a team. ‘This certainly won’t keep her down, she’s very active, she won’t let it ruin her life, she is very bubbly, she is a bit of a monster, she never does as she is told but that attitude has got her through.’ Ewing's sarcoma can occur any time during childhood and young adulthood, and rarely affects older people. The tumour can develop anywhere in the body, but is usually found in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It often spreads to the lungs and other bones. There are few symptoms, but the most common is pain, and occasionally swelling, at the site of the tumour. Fever may also develop. Treatment involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. The five-year survival for localised disease is 70 per cent to 80 per cent when treated with chemotherapy.","Bethan Evans had Ewing's sarcoma - a rare bone and tissue cancer .

Drivers in remote areas could pay less for their petrol and diesel under Government plans to  cut fuel duty. Residents of the Scottish islands and the Scilly Isles already receive a 5p discount on their fuel because the costs of transporting it means prices are higher than on the mainland. Now ministers are considering extending this island fuel rebate scheme to other areas including parts of Devon, Cumbria and Wales. The campaign group FairFuelUK said that even if the consultation was successful it would only help a small number of people and businesses . The Government will collect price details from fuel retailers in 35 remote regions before seeking the right to implement the move from the European Commission. A cut in fuel duty is defined as state aid under EU law and must receive permission from Brussels to go ahead. The overall cost of the scheme will depend on the number of areas affected, but it is likely to run into millions of pounds as retailers would be able to claim back lost revenue from the HMRC. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said it would not be easy to gain approval from Europe. He said: ‘The island fuel rebate provides much needed help to keep down fuel prices in areas where costs of transporting fuel mean prices are much higher. ‘I know that there are other remote rural areas of the UK with similarly high fuel costs. Residents of the Scilly Isles already receive a 5p discount on their fuel because the costs of transporting it means prices are higher than on the mainland . ‘So we are starting to gather further evidence that will form part of an application to the Commission to extend the island fuel duty discount scheme to very remote rural areas. ‘We will need to prove there are areas which are similar to the islands in terms of pump prices and distribution costs so I would urge local areas that may qualify to provide the information we need to make the case as robust as possible. ‘As a Highlander, I know that for people who live in rural areas driving is not a choice, but a necessity. So while it won’t be easy to get this agreed with the Commission, I want to do everything I can to make this happen.’ The campaign group FairFuelUK said that even if the consultation was successful it would only help a small number of people and businesses. Instead, it called for a fuel duty cut across the whole country. Spokesman Quentin Willson said: ‘I welcome the Treasury’s acknowledgement that the UK needs a duty cut, but we need it across the country, not just for remote communities.  Everybody is hurting, not just the few.’ Edmund King, president of the AA, said help for motorists was good news, but all road users needed lower fuel costs. He added: ‘It is quite hard to define a rural area. ‘Our analysis showed that if you have a supermarket close by, that will bring prices down. ‘The Government needs to take measures to increase fuel price transparency as petrol costs and duty are too high generally.’ Nearly 1,500 retailers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are being consulted. The Treasury said it was most interested in identifying areas where prices were consistently similar to those on the islands that already fall under the scheme. But places where prices were consistently lower than those on the islands currently covered are ‘extremely unlikely’ to be included in any extension of the discount scheme. Fuel retailers in the following areas are being asked to submit price data: Aberdeenshire, Angus, Antrim, Argyll and Bute, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Cookstown, Cornwall, Cumbria, Devon, Down, Dumfries and Galloway, Dungannon, Fermanagh, Gwynedd, Herefordshire, Highland, Isle of Anglesey, Larne, Limavady, Magherafelt, Monmouthshire, Moray.

The Government must act to stop motorists who fill up their cars at garages and drive off without paying, fuel industry chiefs warn. The Petrol Retailers Association says that the problem of 'drive-offs' is reaching 'epidemic levels', and says ministers must do something to help petrol stations, rather than leaving it to the police to deal with. The AA also says that the problem has recently intensified, and says two groups of people are responsible: those who simply cannot afford to pay rising petrol prices, and organised gangs who steal fuel on a large scale. Scroll down for video . The number of motorists who drive off from petrol stations without paying is reaching 'epidemic' levels, industry chiefs warn . PRA chairman Brian Madderson told the Daily Telegraph: 'Fuel theft has reached epidemic levels. 'Retailers can do as much as they can - write down number plates, install CCTV - but the police are saying that before they enter it into their records as a criminal offence we have got to prove evidence of criminal intent by the motorist. 'That's near impossible.' Last week a forecourt manager in Kent . was critically injured after trying to stop people driving away from . his petrol station without paying. Lekshmanan Asokkumar, 58, was hurt . while trying to write down the numberplate of a car driven by suspected . fuel thieves at the Texaco garage he manages in West Kingsdown, Kent. His son said the car drove into him, . leaving Mr Asokkumar clinging on to the wipers for 200 yards before he . was thrown from the speeding car onto the side of the road. Last week a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl were arrested in Chatham, Kent, on suspicion of attempted murder. Lekshmanan Asokkumar, 58, was critically injured when trying to stop petrol thieves at his Kent garage . The suspected petrol thieves had targeted this Texaco garage in West Kingsdown, Kent . A spokesman for the AA told . MailOnline: 'We have always seen drive-offs over many years but now the . scale of them has intensified. 'There . are two types of people involved: desperate people who are finding the . cost of fuel too great and have to resort to desperate measures to stay . mobile, and organised crime gangs who steal anything that is expensive, . like fuel.' He said the . latter type tended not to steal petrol because it was too volatile to . handle, but would steal diesel, either by filling drums inside a van or . even by using small tankers. 'Earlier this year there was a spate of fuel thefts and we are not talking hundreds of litres, we are talking thousands of litres.' Going up: Fuel prices have soared in the last few years, making it an attractive target for thieves . The AA spokesman said that petrol station managers did use numberplate recognition, CCTV cameras, and spoke to each other about which vehicles to look out for, but said none of this was any use if thieves used stolen numberplates to cover their own. Recently gangs have gone to petrol stations when they were closed and prised fuel reservoirs open before helping themselves. Fuel prices are at near-record levels, with unleaded costing an average 137.22p a litre and diesel 141.51p a litre. Last month the AA warned that fuel prices were set to soar over the summer because of rising wholesale costs and the weakness of the pound against the dollar.

Texas Governor Rick Perry made quite the entrance before delivering his speech at the National Rifle Association convention this weekend, showing off his impressive shooting skills. The NRA is holding its annual convention in  the Governor's home state, with more than 70,000 people attending to hear speeches and demos of guns and ammo. Perry's shown here using a military style rifle and being so accurate in his sharp-shooting as to explode an egg from 100 yards during target practice. Scroll down for video... Don't mess with the Governor: Rick Perry strikes a pose after blasting an egg to smithereens in an introductory video for the NRA conference . The short video played just before Perry took the stage to a rapturous welcome from the crowd and showed him gunning down target after target. The film ends in slow motion with him removing the magazine and giving a hero-like gaze. Perry uses a LaRue Tactical rifle, which recently opened up shop in Texas. The video goes on to show the marksman-like Perry aiming at metal objects. Taking aim: The Governor shows off his sharp-shooting skills using a LaRue PredatOBR 7.62 rifle . Now you see it... Now you don't! We're out of eggs. How was that? The Governor looks off-camera for reassurance at his performance . Rick Perry's office said he was shooting a LaRue PredatOBR 7.62. Online the film got a mixed reaction with some saying they loved him and that it qualified him to be President, whilst others said it did nothing but 'promote and excite the already gun-thirsty and violent society'. Perry is an avid gun rights supporter and shooter and as Governor has attempted to draw more firearms manufacturers to Texas. Governor Rick Perry: It is time to stop demonizing all law-abiding gun owners because of violent acts committed by a few criminals . Rick Perry: Rick Perry speaks during the leadership forum at the National Rifle Association's annual where he told the audience that President Obama wants to ¿disarm the American public¿ . During his speech to the convention he said that passing new gun control laws won’t stop criminals and would only make law-abiding citizens easy targets by depriving them of weapons to defend themselves. Perry said issues such as tighter background checks on guns sales would only hurt non-criminals who want to buy them. Perry says there are 'no easy fixes' to gun violence, but that limiting gun ownership is not the answer. In January, Perry lashed out at President Barack Obama’s plan on the heels of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to curb gun violence, saying that the Second Amendment trumps Barack Obama or any other president.","Video played to delegates at NRA convention .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:21 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:56 EST, 18 July 2013 . Texas Governor Rick Perry signed tough new abortion law restrictions today, including a ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and rules that could shutter most of the clinics in the state. More than 100 Republican lawmakers attended the signing ceremony in Austin, Texas, with a small band of protesters outside dressed in black and holding a sign that read, 'Shame.' The legislation, which is one of the biggest victories in a decade for opponents of abortion, had sparked weeks of protests at the state Capitol. Law signing: Gov. Rick Perry, third from left, speaks at a signing ceremony for the the abortion restriction bill, House Bill 2, at the Capitol in Austin, Texas . Perry signed the measure flanked by invited political supporters and anti-abortion activists, who gave him a standing ovation as he entered the room. 'It is a very happy and celebratory day,' said Perry, who thanked anti-abortion activists for helping to 'support the health of Texas women'. The new law bans abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and dictates when abortion-inducing drugs can be taken. The law will prohibit anyone other than a doctor dispensing the so-called 'abortion pill,' or RU-486 drug, to end pregnancies, and require that a second dosage be administered at a clinic under a doctor's supervision and not at home. Protests break out: Lenell Ripley, second from left, cries as she demonstrates with other abortion rights supporters holding coat hangers outside the Capitol auditorium in Austin, Texas . Should abortions be banned after 20 weeks of pregnancy? It also requires abortion clinic doctors to have hospital admitting privileges and restricts abortions to surgical centers. Only five of Texas' 42 abortion clinics currently meet the new requirements. The law will take effect in October and clinics will have a year to upgrade their facilities or shutdown. Perry said the new law 'builds upon our commitment to protecting life in the state of Texas.' Texas Republicans, who have a large majority in the state legislature, pushed through the restrictions over the fierce objection of Democrats and supporters of the right to abortion. Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis briefly caught national attention last month by staging a filibuster to stall the restrictions, although her gambit ultimately failed. While several other conservative states have approved piecemeal abortion restrictions, Texas is by far the most populous and politically important, and it took more dramatic action by combining several measures into one bill. Fighting for their rights: Abortion rights supporters demonstrate outside the Capitol in Austin, Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry signed the abortion restriction bill . The Texas measures are also more far reaching than a ban passed by the U.S. Congress in 2003 on a type of late-term abortion called 'partial birth', which covered only a small fraction of abortions performed each year. Texas joins 12 other states which have passed bans on abortion after 20 weeks, citing disputed research that a fetus feels pain by that stage. North Dakota and Arkansas have gone further, banning abortion as early as six and 12 weeks respectively. The current limit for abortions in Texas is 26 weeks. Texas already has a law passed two years ago requiring a woman to undergo an ultrasound and be shown the results, before an abortion can be performed. Opponents of the new Texas law say it will be found unconstitutional because the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973 allowed abortion up to the point a fetus is viable, or can live outside the womb. The governor and other top Republican politicians in the state made passing the law a top priority, in part to please supporters before the primary election in March. Demonstrations in Texas: Sarah Dickerson, from left, Kamene Dornubari-Ogidi, Kandace Vallejo, Rockie Gonzalez and Bianca Hinz-Foley demonstrate outside the Capitol auditorium in Austin . On stage: The ceremony approved a tough new law that won't allow abortions in Texas after 20 weeks of pregnancy . They failed to pass the bill last month on the last day of a special legislative session because of a Democratic state senator's lengthy filibuster and a raucous crowd. But they were successful last week after Perry called a second special session to get the bill approved. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said today that the 'radical left' had inflicted 'intentional chaos' that delayed the bill's initial passage. He credited prayer and even 'the hand of God' in making Thursday's event happen, as about 25 protesters could be heard chanting 'Shame! Shame! Shame!' out in the hallway. Supporters of the law argue that it will ensure high-quality health care for women and fetuses, but opponents view it as over-regulation intended to make abortions harder to obtain. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of similar measures in other states, questioning their constitutionality. Opponents are expected to file similar suits in Texas now that Perry has signed the law. The abortion rights activists vowed to immediately challenge the Texas law in court. 'The fight over this law will move to the courts,' Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement after the signing. 'People are enraged by this law.' Some challenges of other state laws have been successful. A federal judge on Wednesday extended for two more weeks a hold on a Wisconsin provision requiring doctors performing an abortion have admitting privileges at a hospital, while the judge studies whether to block the law. The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled recently on an abortion case. In 2006 it narrowly endorsed, 5 to 4, the U.S. Congressional ban on 'partial birth' abortions.","New law takes effect in October .

It is no secret that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge share a love of Africa: Prince William first visited the country during his gap year and the couple got engaged on a safari holiday in Kenya. So what better gift to mark the birth of their son, Prince George, than a sterling silver figurine of an African animal? The Mail on Sunday has discovered that William and Kate’s closest friends have bought presents for the baby from upmarket designer Patrick Mavros, who has shops in London, Harare and Mauritius. Jewel in the crown: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been receiving gifts from friends made by their favourite jeweller . Animal magic: Jeweller Patrick Mavros first started drawing birds of prey after he contracted polio in his native Zimbabwe. He later started making jewellery based on his designs. Left, a meercat, right, a baboon and baby . The Duchess has long been a fan of Mavros – she discovered him when she was designing jewellery at Jigsaw and bought £70 crocodile stud earrings, £150 Ndoro drop earrings and a £250 Zozo elephant pendant – and has taken her mother and sister to the Fulham Road shop. Now she has introduced Prince William and Prince Harry to the designer, and she and William are believed to be collecting the firm’s miniatures to decorate their apartment in Kensington Palace. The miniatures range from a £110 warthog scratching to an elephant cow and four calves at £4,700. The Royals are in good company – author J. K. Rowling bought a silver Mavros dodo, inspired by the island of Mauritius, where the extinct birds lived, and Prince Juan Carlos of Spain asked Mavros to customise the gearstick of his Maybach car with a gold pangolin, which is similar to an anteater. Little gem: The sterling silver African animals make the perfect gift for the baby Prince. His parents got engaged during a visit to Kenya, in the East of the continent . Last night Patrick’s son Alexander, 33, who runs the UK shop, refused to comment on the gifts. ‘We are lucky to have some great customers and we are always grateful for the support we have received from them,’ he said. His father was equally reticent about discussing the Royal couple. ‘I have never been to the homes of the Royal Family  so I don’t know what they have got,’ he said. ‘I think it is remarkable how discreet their friends are.’ Miniatures: Mavros's designs range from £110 for a warthog to £4,700 for an elephant and her calves . With his untamed hair, bushy beard and piercing eyes, Zimbabwean jeweller Mavros, 60, is not an obvious figure to be attracting such an elevated clientele. But he has gained a cult following among the Royals. He began drawing birds of prey at the age of five in his native Matabeleland, in the western province of Zimbabwe, after he contracted polio and was unable to walk for a year. But it was not until later in life that he began making jewellery – he trained as a baker and served as a soldier in the Rhodesian wars before making a pair of rosebud earrings out of ivory for his wife Catja, 57. ‘The local hairdresser liked them so I gave a pair to her and the business grew from there,’ he laughed. He studied lost-wax casting, where a mould is used only once to make the piece original, working in silver. His business has been so successful that his four sons have followed him into the profession: Alexander runs the London store; Forbes, 32, designs jewellery in Mauritius; and Pat, 28, and Ben, 25, are based in Harare. ‘I try to take stories from our tribal customs and put them together in such a way that the stories are interesting,’ Mavros said. ‘If a couple get married, the  most appropriate gift to give them would be a Klipspringer, a couple of small antelope, who are the closest couple in the animal kingdom. ‘But for a couple with a new baby? I imagine there would be a whole host of animals protective of their babies. Cult following: Patrick Mavros with his wife wife Catja, whom he made his first piece of jewellery for, a pair or rosebud earrings from ivory. JK Rowling (right) is also a fan of his work . 'But what I think would be the most appropriate gift would be a young elephant calf walking under the belly of its mother while a bull stands by. After all, it could become a herd one day.’ The Royal couple have received many presents for their son, despite their suggestion that wellwishers give money to charity instead. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall bought cashmere blankets, cardigans and hats from Scottish warrant-holder Johnstons of Elgin. David Cameron sent a set of Roald Dahl books, Ed Miliband gave an apple tree and Nick Clegg sent a bag of coffee and a cot cover and sheet embroidered by Spanish nuns in his wife Miriam’s home village. Out of Africa: No river on the continent is said to be really wild unless it is inhabited by crocodiles, the most successful ancestor of the dinosaurs. This silver specimen would set you back £3,200 .","Unusual African animal jewellery is a big hit with the Royal couple .

Across the country in mid Missouri, another natural disaster has wreaked havoc for many families. The Missouri Department of Transportation closed Interstate 44 south of Rolla along the Gasconade River, and U.S. 63 in Maries County after about six inches of rain fell in the area. Traffic was being rerouted several miles around the flooded sections of the highways, said Sgt. Dan Crain, spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol in Rolla. The National Weather Service said the Gasconade River at Rich Fountain was about four feet below flood stage, the point at which water is high enough to cause flooding, early yesterday. Across the country: In Newburg, Missouri, residents faced a different natural disaster - flood water from Little Piney Creek, which burst its banks after torrential stormy weather yesterday . Interstate 44 near Jerome, Missouri, was closed by the rising waters, where the confluence of the Gasconade River and Little Piney Creek met. Gov. Jay Nixon has ordered the Missouri National Guard to help with flooding in south-central Missouri . No go: Missouri Department of Transport and State trooper workers guarded and assessed the flooded main road, and advised all drivers not to attempt to cross flooded roads . It was expected to reach its 20-foot flood stage later in the day and rise to near 32 feet early this morning, depending on how much more rain hits the area. 'It's a real mess,' Sgt Crain said. 'We're encouraging folks to be really careful. When there's water over the roads, don't take the chance. Don't take the risk. Please turn around.' Hurricane Henriette is expected to weaken as it moves across the Pacific, far from land. The hurricane's maximum sustained winds late Wednesday remained near 85mph (140 kph). The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami says additional weakening is forecast by Thursday as Henriette moves over cooler waters. Henriette is centered about 1,235 miles (1987 kilometers) east of Hilo, Hawaii, and is moving west-northwest near 10 mph (17 kph). Governor Jay Nixon also ordered the deployment of 50 military policemen of the Missouri National Guard to help local authorities dealing with flooding. Nixon declared a state of emergency Tuesday after heavy rains caused flash flooding and at least one confirmed death in the Waynesville area. A four-year-old boy was killed and several homes and businesses damaged after heavy rain drenched the south-central town of Waynesville on Monday night and Tuesday morning. The search for a missing woman who is believed to be the child's mother also resumed yesterday. About a dozen homes were evacuated early Wednesday in Newburg, a Phelps County town of about 450 residents near the Little Piney River. Laura Johnson, supervisor with the Phelps County Sheriff's Department, said a 12ft section of a county road washed away Wednesday morning. No injuries were reported. 'We have a lot of roads shut down now,' Johnson said. The rain had stopped yesterday morning in several areas, including Newburg, and water had begun receding in some flooded sections, she said. The weather service also issued flood warnings yesterday for several southwestern Missouri counties, including Laclede and Wright counties, where several low-water crossings were also flooding after about two inches of rain fell in that region by early morning yesterday.","Raging wildfire in San Jacinto Mountains near Banning, California, has forced 1,500 to flee .

But a US Circuit Court of Appeals judge has agreed with her lawyers that ruled that the conviction had been due in part because of a crooked cop who had a history of lying under oath. Milke's conviction was overturned on . March 14th allowing prosecutors to launch an appeal to hold a retrial . within 30 days. No application for a retrial has been filed which means . she could soon be a free woman. The move marked a surprising turn in a case that made national headlines due to the brazen and disturbing nature of the crime. Prosecutors said in December 1989, Milke dressed up her son Christopher in his favorite outfit and told him he was going to see Santa Claus at a Phoenix mall during the holidays. Instead, he was taken into a ravine in the desert by her boyfriend, Roger Scott and another man called Styers and shot three times in the back of the head as part of what prosecutors said was a plot by Milke and the two other defendants to collect a $50,000 life insurance policy. Milke, who was not present at the crime, was convicted in 1990 of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on the strength of testimony by Phoenix Police Detective Armando Saldate, who said she confessed to the crimes. The detective testified that Milke told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with Christopher and had complained to Styers about her son. Styers was hardly an ideal babysitter. He had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder stemming in large part from an incident during the war when he shot and killed a young Vietnamese boy who had climbed onto a truck transporting Styers and other Marines in Vietnam, according to court documents. In his 1985 personal journal, now part of court records, Styers wrote: 'Losing sleep because of dreams in Viet-Nam [sic] Seeing kids including my own and wondering if I'm going to do something to hurt them, and remembering the ones I had to kill.' With Christopher in the car, Styers picked up his good friend Roger Scott. The two men did not take Christopher to see Santa. Instead, they drove Christopher into the desert, where Styers emptied three bullets into the boy's head. Milke was convicted in 1990 of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping in a plot to collect a $50,000 life insurance policy . The Phoenix police department's star interrogator, Det. Armando Saldate Jr., was called in on his day off to separately question the three. In a matter of hours, Saldate had secured a speedy resolution to the horrific high-profile holiday crime.The detective said she confessed to conspiring to the murder, although she protested her innocence and denied the claim. The three suspects were tried separately, convicted, and sentenced to die. Milke would have been the first woman executed in Arizona since the 1930s had her appeals run out. The Arizona Supreme Court had gone so far to issue a death warrant for Milke in 1997, but the execution was delayed because she had yet to exhaust federal appeals. During her original trial, the prosecution failed to disclose information about a history of misconduct by Detective Saldate. That record included multiple court rulings in four other cases that Saldate either lied under oath or violated suspects’ Miranda rights during interrogations. Prosecutors are required to provide a defendant’s lawyers with material that might support a not-guilty verdict, including material that could undermine the credibility of a prosecution witness. There was no other witness or recording of the purported confession by Milke, who has proclaimed her innocence. In court proceedings and press interviews, Milke professed her innocence, claiming Saldate had a history of lying under oath and had fabricated her confession. The trial amounted to ‘a swearing contest’ in which the judge and jury ultimately believed the detective over Milke, but they didn’t know of his record of dishonesty and misconduct. The ruling reversed a US District Court judge’s ruling and ordered the lower court to require Arizona authorities to turn over all relevant personnel records for the detective. Key witness: Milke, left, was found guilty on the strength of testimony by a Phoenix police detective, who said the mother told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with Christopher, right . In 2009, defense attorney Michael Kimerer said his client maintains her innocence and was a loving mother who still grieves her son’s death. ‘Our main concern is the fact that I have . a client that never confessed and a police detective who said she gave a . confession,’ Kimerer said then. ‘There was no tape recorder, no . witnesses, nothing. Just his word.’ In March the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Milke's conviction in what Chief Judge Alex Kozinski dubbed a 'troubling case.' He called into question what he said was Saldate's possible 'misogynistic' attitude towards vulnerable civilian women over whom he had  power and noted Saldate had a documented history of lying under oath. Kozinski's blistering 60-page opinion and other court records shed light on the alleged police corruption, prosecutorial overreach and judicial carelessness that fused into a miscarriage of justice that might have sentenced an innocent woman to death. Milke testified she didn't know Christopher had died until Saldate informed her of his death in an interrogation room. She said she was 'in shock' and 'reeling' but the detective moved close to her and put his hands on her knees. She told the jury she hadn't understood her Miranda rights and had asked for a lawyer, but instead Saldate continued interrogating her and twisted her words into a fake confession. 'She was one of the worst witnesses I've ever seen,; recalls Phoenix journalist Paul Rubin, who covered the trial. Although he destroyed his notes of the interview and failed to tape record it, Saldate testified that Milke confessed she worried that Christopher would grow up to be just like his father, a substance-abusing ex-con. That's why she 'wanted God to take care of Christopher,' Saldate testified. After Milke was convicted, her defense investigators spent 7,000 hours poring over court records. They discovered eight separate cases in which judges determined that Saldate either had lied under oath or violated the constitutional rights of people he interrogated. But Hendrix, the judge, still decided that Saldate was more credible than Milke . Court records indicate that neither Styers nor Scott would testify against Milke. In overturning Milke’s conviction, the appellate court didn’t find her innocent. 'Milke may well be guilty, even if Saldate made up her confession out of whole cloth,' Kozinski wrote. 'After all, it's hard to understand what reason Styers and Scott would have had for killing a four-year-old boy. Then again, what reason would they have to protect her if they knew she was guilty?' Milke, now 49, was jailed the day after Christopher's death. She is one of three women on death row in Arizona and has been behind bars for 25 years and on death row for 22 years. The two men convicted in the Milke’s case, Roger Scott and former Milke roommate James Styers, are also both on death row. Scott confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy’s body, but neither Scott or Styers would testify against Milke.","'Death Row Debbie's' conviction due in part because of detective lying under oath .

A female member of the British Navy has revealed how seven years in the service left her five stone overweight. Jodie Williams, 34, was a radar operator in the Navy and spent most of her time outnumbered by men. But just as her male colleagues would wind down by drinking pints of beer and eating takeaways, so Jodie would join in. The unhealthy lifestyle quickly saw her pile on the pounds. Jodie, from Walderslade, Kent, admits that during her seven years in the Navy she was the life and soul of the party and would match her male colleagues drink for drink and then go for a curry afterwards. Jodie drinking on a night out in her past life (left) and looking radiant on holiday with her new figure (right) Jodie, who was honoured with an Air Operations Medal and served her country all over the world., says she loved her job - but saw the Navy lifestyle took a real toll on her figure as she ate and drank more and saw her weight soar out of control. When she joined she was a slim size ten, super-fit and weighed just 10st 2lb with a 29 inch waist. When she left seven years later, her weight had shot up to 14st 10lb, she was a size 18 with a 42 inch waist. 'I used to eat and drink like a bloke,' she says. Jodie knew she had to turn her life around and decided to regain the figure she had when she was a new naval recruit. She admits that her diet at the time was a bit of a disaster. 'I hated being overweight. It stripped me of a lot of my natural confidence,' said Jodie. 'I hit rock bottom and realised I . needed to change.' She started going to the gym and swapped her bad diet for healthy food. Jodie puts her success in part down to Forza . Raspberry Ketone - a diet supplement used by Oprah Winfrey and Kim . Kardashian that is said to suppress appetite and speed up metabolism. In her Navy days, Jodie was one of lads, matching them drink for drink - and then joining in with a curry . 'The real spur to lose weight came when I saw my figure . changing and how much better I looked,' she says. 'The weight came off me fairly . easily and I was seeing a real change in my outlook and how other people . perceived me. It was really quite inspiring.' Her weight decreased from 14 stone to just above 10 stone. Jodie loved her new appearance so much that she completely changed her image. Ditching the capacious, frumpy dresses she wore to hide her body, Jodie started stepping out in boob tubes and other funkier clothes. The one downside of all the weight loss was that her breasts 'disappeared'. 'They had shot up to a 36D when I was overweight,' said Jodie. 'But once I had lost the weight my boobs were just empty and had no definition. So I had a boob job and went up to a 32F to get my figure back.' Though she admits: 'I think I overdid slightly because they are too big now.' After shedding the pounds Jodie has revealed a stunning new look complete with cropped hairstyle and fitted clothes which show off her tanned new figure. The newly single Jodie also noticed a different reaction from men immediately. Toned and tanned, Jodie has found a new man after shedding the pounds and increasing her bust . 'I'd walk into a bar and just know that I was being looked at. It did wonders for my confidence and finally I was dating men who I had chosen rather than the other way around. It was liberating to be completely in charge of my own destiny,' she said. Pretty and fun-loving, Jodie, was never short of a boyfriend, even at her heaviest. But one crucial fact meant she was unlikely to find happiness. 'I used to go out with whoever wanted to go out with me - not the other way around,' she said. 'I settled down with one man because I was fat and I was worried I was going to get left on the shelf. Basically I was always settling for second best.' But just months after achieving her ideal weight and after her breast operation, Jodie met the man of her dreams on a night out. Things have gone from strength to strength and the happy couple now live together in Kent. The Raspberry Ketone pills Jodie used to help her slim suppress the appetite and release caffeine for energy and to increase resting metabolism. They claim to allows users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising. 'They don't just work on their own - you have to combine them with exercise and a good diet,' said Jodie. 'But they make such a difference. Just when you are feeling peckish in between meals you take a pill and it takes your mind off food. They really helped me to get down to my idea weight. 'Now I am at 10 stone I still take them to keep my weight steady. I have my weight under control with the changes in my lifestyle. I will never be fat again.' Jodie has also finally met the man of her dreams and has never been happier. 'Everything is good in my life. I am so thrilled with how things have turned out,' she said.

A father who was forced to pay back part of the insurance money he was awarded when his 15-year-old son was killed in a car crash has made the payment in quarters to protest at the ruling. An armored car was used to deliver a third of the $500,000 to two Illinois law firms that Roger Herrin was ordered to repay. Mr Herrin, of Harrisburg, was forced to pay back the funds after the survivors of the crash that killed his son appealed a decision that awarded him the larger share of the insurance money. Delivery: Roger Herrin, whose son was killed in a crash, decided to pay part of an insurance claim refund in quarters to protest at the decision . His son, Michael, was in a car with three other people when it was hit by a truck that failed to stop at a junction in June 2001. They had been returning from playing golf when the truck hit the Jeep the group was in, killing Michael and injuring the other passengers, according to WSIL3. Mr Herrin said he made the repayment on Wednesday, using quarters he had ordered from the St Louis Federal Reserve, as a protest at the appeal ruling. 'There was no satisfaction from doing that. The loss of a child is the loss of a child, and all the money doesn't replace that,' he said. The 76-year-old added: 'I just wanted to draw attention to what went on here. I really wanted to do it in pennies.' Mr Herrin, a retired foot surgeon, arranged for a truck carrying 150 bags - each filled with $1,000 dollars of quarters and weighing 50lb - to deliver the funds to the two law firms. 'They can have all the money in the world and I'd take my son back,' Mr Herrin said. 'It leaves a hole in your heart that is never repairable.' Protest: Roger Herrin watches as 150 bags, each containing $1,000 of quarters, are unloaded at an Illinois law firm . Weight of grief: A decision to award the Herrins with $600,000 after Michael's death was appealed by the three survivors of the crash . Hefty: Workers carry the coin bags that weigh 50lb each into a law firm . The legal battle over the insurance money has been continuing since the crash, and centers on the distribution of underinsured motorist insurance. The Jeep Michael was a passenger in was covered for $800,000. At the time, a judge ruled that because his son had died, Mr Herrin should be awarded $600,000. Through other lines of insurance, Mr Herrin and his ex-wife also received $1.65 million in payouts, so an appellate court ordered a refund of part of his share, and increased the portion awarded to the other people involved in the crash. Attorneys for the other victims have not commented on the case because of confidentiality agreements. However, staff at the law firms that took delivery of the quarters said they would have liked notice of the payment and said that it could create a security risk for them. Fatal: Michael Herrin was killed when a truck hit this Jeep in 2001 . Mark Prince, who represents the driver of the Jeep and her son, told the Bellingham Herald: 'We've been on pins and needles because we had a lot of cash suddenly laying around.' He added: 'We don't have safes or vaults ... advance notice would have been nice, because we could have made arrangements to have it delivered to the bank.' Douglas Dorris, an attorney for the other surviving occupant of the Jeep, added: 'I am not going to criticize a man who lost his son, who is obviously upset with the decisions of the court. But I believe the decisions of the appellate court follow the law correctly.'","Survivors of car crash that killed 15-year-old appeal against father's payout .

Offenders: Lord Selsdon said he found that British families travelling in large 4X4 cars to go skiing in the Alps were the most badly behaved . Most of us don’t have the time or the energy to reprimand anti-social drivers who drop litter out of their car windows. But it seems Tory peer Lord Selsdon has both these gifts – and good connections to boot. In an extraordinary outburst in a . House of Lords debate yesterday, the 75-year-old told colleagues how he . calls his ‘friends at the DVLA’ to obtain the vehicle owner’s phone . number. Lord Selsdon said he records the number plates of British cars when abroad if sees litter being dumped on the road before calling up his friends at the DVLA. The peer claimed the DVLA would then use the details to find the telephone numbers of offenders before handing them over. But with a possible threat to data . protection laws, the DVLA said it was trying to contact the hereditary . peer before considering launching a full probe. The . Data Protection Act requires organisations such as the DVLA to keep the . personal information they are processing secure and to have controls on . making sure such information is not inappropriately accessed. But . Lord Selsdon told the House of Lords that he found that British . families travelling in large 4x4s to go skiing in the Alps were the most . badly behaved. The peer said: ‘I find when you look at . the international scene that, believe it or not, some of the most badly . behaved now are British families in large 4x4s driving to the Alps to . ski. ‘They . are the ones I've followed occasionally and, for a bit of fun, I've . just taken note of their number and occasionally manage - because I have . friends with DVL(A) - to find their telephone and I give them a ring. ‘I . just say, ‘I'm sorry I happen to be involved in the political world a . bit and it was noticed that at a particular point you did this”. ‘And . of course most continental motorways have got signs every kilometre or . every half kilometre or often more often so you know exactly where you . are and so do the spies. Rubbish: Tory peer Lord Selsdon said he notes down the number plates of British cars he sees littering abroad . ‘If the police themselves are deciding . that they may be perhaps a little short of income for Christmas, the . number of fines seems to go up. Lord Selsdon's speech on littering comes as he marks his 50th anniversary in the House of Lords. An ex-Naval officer, he took his seat in 1963 after his father's. The 76-year-old is one of just 90 hereditary peers left on the red benches. He worked in business and banking before entering Parliament. He lists skiiing among his interests and has been President of the Anglo-Swiss society, which might explain how he spots the littering drivers in the Alps. He once launched a campaign to find out if there was a legal definition of the role of a peer. He was told there wasn't. 'There is of course absolutely no connection between these two issues. But this is self-interest.’ Lord Selsdon made the surprise admission during a debate on a legislation drawn up by former journalist, Tory Lord Marlesford, which calls for anyone caught throwing rubbish out of a vehicle to be fined. Under the Littering from Vehicles Bill, a registered driver would be the automatic recipient of the fine. The Bill, which stands little chance of becoming law, would require local authorities to publish the details of the contracts awarded in relation to its enforcement. A spokeswoman for the DVLA said: ‘We are writing to Lord Selsdon to ask him for further information. ‘Depending on his reply, we will then decide on whether or not it is necessary to conduct a full investigation.’ She said drivers were not obliged to provide their telephone numbers when applying for a licence so that in some cases the agency would not hold the details apparently requested by Lord Selsdon. Investigation: The DVLA said it would contact Lord Selsdon before deciding whether to launch a probe into the potential breach of data protection laws . The spokeswoman added: ‘We take our responsibility to protect information seriously. That is why information is only provided under strict controls to those who are legally entitled to it, such as local authorities and the police.’ A spokesman for the Information Commissioner said: ‘We expect any organisation handling personal information to have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that access to people's details is strictly controlled. 'These arrangements must be effective in practice.’","Lord Selsdon says British families in 4x4s in the Alps are worst offenders .

CNN's chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta has come out in favor of marijuana – a turn around on his former stance – and says the American people have been ‘systematically misled’ on the dangers of the drug. Dr Gupta, named one of People magazine's sexiest men alive in 2003, has revealed he changed his mind after working on a forthcoming documentary (‘Weeds’) and he apologized for his own role in the misinformation. ‘We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologize for my own role in that,’ he wrote on CNN.com. CNN's chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta has come out in favour of marijuana and says the American people have been 'systematically misled' on the dangers of the drug . Gupta also revealed his turnaround in a special edition of Piers Morgan's CNN show on Wednesday night. In the program both men admitted that they has tried the demon weed, although Gupta said he didn’t care for it. After traveled around world over the past year to interview medical leaders, experts, growers and patients on the topic Gupta described has findings as ‘stunning’. Prior to his recent research, Gupta said he had been unimpressed by the case typically made for medical marijuana. ‘I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof,’ he wrote. Gupta claims that the Drug Enforcement Agency 'doesn't have the science' to lump marijuana as a schedule 1 substance, the most dangerous category . Here's what Gupta has to say now about cannabis after his recent research... ...but back in 2009 when he was very staunchly against legalizing it... He now claims that they 'don’t have the science' to lump marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs. The shift in stance marks quite a turnaround for Gupta who in 2009 wrote an article in TIME magazine entitled ‘Why I would Vote No on Pot.’ At that time he claimed many people in favor of legalizing the drug simply wanted to get stoned. 'As a doctor, smoking the stuff is not going to do your health any good,' he concluded at the time. Now he says it doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications for the drug. In researching his documentary he said he was ‘unsettled’ by the lack of science in Assistant Secretary of Health Dr. Roger Egeberg’s recommendation in 1970 that marijuana should be classified as a schedule 1 substance. Gupta pointed out that while marijuana leads to dependence in about 10 percent of adult users, that is half the rate of dependence amongst cocaine users, which is only a schedule 2 substance ‘with less abuse potential than schedule 1 drugs.’ Around 25 percent of heroin users become addicted, while 30 percent of smokers become addicted and many go on to die as a result. However he did issue a note of caution about teenagers using the drug. Young, developing brains are likely more susceptible to harm from marijuana than adult brains, he said. He cited recent studies which suggest regular use in teenage years can lead to a permanent decrease in IQ, while other research has hinted at a possible heightened risk of developing psychosis. ‘Much in the same way I wouldn't let my own children drink alcohol, I wouldn't permit marijuana until they are adults,’ he wrote. ‘If they are adamant about trying marijuana, I will urge them to wait until they're in their mid-20s when their brains are fully developed.’ Now that Gupta has seen the light on the positive medical benefits of the drug, he promises to do his part to help and 'genuinely and honestly' try to fill the remaining void in our knowledge about the drug.","Gupta says the American people have been 'systematically misled' on the dangers of marijuana .

The billionaire Microsoft founder, who last year donated $750million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, questioned whether bringing the Internet to some of the world's poorest countries really got to the heart of the problem. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Gates said that although he was a big supporter of the Internet's power to further healthcare, it did not directly address the problem of disease.

Philanthropists: Since retiring from full-time work with Microsoft, Gates and wife Melinda (pictured) has thrown himself into his philanthropy through his charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which gives aid to some of the most underprivileged countries in the world . Gates, who was once again crowned the world's richest man in 2013, also criticized Google's track record when it comes to philanthropy. The Internet search giant's charity work is conducted through Google.org. It launched with much fanfare and was headed up by Larry Brilliant - a former World Health Organization leader - from 2006. He left the position in 2009. Of its charity arm, Google says: 'We focus on problems where Google’s assets and core capabilities - technology innovation, global presence, making massive amounts of information universally accessible and useful - play strongest and where the solutions we create have the most potential to scale.' Among the company's projects are crisis response for natural disasters, using Google alerts to share information from emergency services and Google Person Finder to help find family and friends.

Conditions inside Bedlam were depicted . by William Hogarth in his 18th century drawings A Rake’s Progress, . charting the decline of a merchant’s son from wealthy heir to asylum . inmate, via debtor’s jail. In 1676, the asylum moved to nearby . Moorfields, then in 1815 to Southwark. Now the Bethlem Royal Hospital, . it has been in Beckenham, Kent, since 1930 and is part of the South . London and Maudsley NHS Trust. At the Crossrail site, it will not be . possible to distinguish Bedlam patients from other dead, as mental . illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons. In most cases, identification will be . difficult, if not impossible, because although some were buried in . coffins, any name plates recovered have been too rusty to read. The . dig’s manager, Nick Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology, is . part of a team of more than 100 archaeologists who are examining each of . the 40 sites being dug up for Crossrail, the  73-mile rail line that . will link the City, Canary Wharf, the West End and Heathrow to commuter . areas east and west of London. Major operation: More than 100 archaeologists have worked on the Crossrail excavations over four years . Anonymous: The identity of most of the bodies will never be discovered because of a lack of burial records . Overflow: The graveyard was established in the 16th century as the cemeteries of parish churches were filling up . Investigation: 4,000 skeletons will be disinterred and studied before being reburied elsewhere . Back in time: Archaeologist Mike Tunnicliffe holding flint as he and his team have been uncovering layers of London's history including the a 'tool-making factory' including 150 pieces of flint from the Mesolithic Age . Roman: This brass sestertius coin from the site dates back to 30 AD and bears the image of Emperor Hadrian . Mr Elsden said: ‘This site is a rare, . perhaps unprecedented, opportunity. This is a major roadway outside one . of London’s busiest railway stations. You don’t get to dig that up . normally. Everyone’s been running around Liverpool Street for years not . thinking they are walking around on bodies from one of the densest . burial grounds in London.’ The bones, some from children, will be examined for clues as to how their owners lived and died. There is already evidence that some suffered from rickets. It is thought other bones will bear the scars of late-stage syphilis. Valuable: A 16th-century Venetian gold coin with a hole enabling it to be worn around the neck . Shiny: A gold sequin, Leonardo Loredan dated 1501-1521AD, discovered at the Liverpool Street site .

Learning: An archaeologist from the Museum of London next to a map of the site being excavated . Location: The cemetery is located next to Liverpool Street, near the original site of the hospital . Other finds at Liverpool Street . include the project’s first piece of gold – a 16th century Venetian . coin. It had been pierced, so it is likely to have been worn as a . pendant. The site also holds earlier secrets. Some 11ft below the skeletons lie the remains of a Roman road studded . with 2,000-year-old horseshoes – hoof-shaped ‘sandals’ made of metal and . secured by leather strapping. Roman coins have also been found, one . from around AD130 depicting the Emperor Hadrian. Matthew Symonds, editor of Current . Archaeology magazine, said: ‘What’s wonderful about this graveyard is . that you are looking at a cross-section of society. ‘Historical records will be from the . more educated and better off sections, but this is something that tells . us how everyday people lived their lives. That kind of glimpse into the . past is invaluable.’ Bedlam: The scene inside the hospital as depicted by William Hogarth in The Rake's Progress . The Bethlem Royal Hospital was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe, having been founded as a priory in 1247 and converted into a hospital in the early 14th century. It was founded by Goffredo de Prefetti, who had been elected Bishop of Bethlehem, and was originally located just outside the London city wall, on the site of what is now Liverpool Street station. Due to the hospital's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane, a bastardised version of its name - 'Bedlam' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally. Although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly, most were free to walk around the grounds, and conditions were not much worse than the average home of the period. In 1674, the hospital's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to Moorfields, with the area's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises. Bethlem moved against in 1815, to St George's Fields in Southwark, which is now the site of the Imperial War Museum. A final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of Bromley - it is now run by the NHS and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital.","500-year-old graveyard near Liverpool Street found during Crossrail works .

A Beatles superfan has created a unique book of ordinary people's chance encounters with the world’s most famous band. The Beatles and Me by Dean Johnson, which is being officially launched on Monday, is devoted to meetings between John, Paul, George and Ringo, and their adoring fans. Compiled from more than 700 contributions, it contains stories and pictures from over five decades of Beatlemania. Rare: A fragile signed photo given to fan Enrique Esteban Zepeda Vazquez of a young John Lennon and George Harrison at the barbers' Superfans: Liz and Jim Hughes who ran the Beatles Museum getting to meet their hero Paul McCartney . Iconic studios: Young fan Richard Porter met McCartney outside Abbey Road in 1982 . The book came together after Johnson set up a Facebook page at Christmas to learn about other people’s memories of meeting The Beatles. Johnson, from Wirral, Merseyside, said: 'Everyone here has a Beatles story, whether they have met them personally or they know someone who worked on one of their bathrooms. 'I thought it would be a laugh to set up the page and see if anyone had anything interesting to say. 'Posts came flooding in and the idea snowballed. The things people posted were fantastic and very interesting. 'Perhaps the most touching of the tales . was a story of when somebody was stopped outside The Cavern Club a few . months before George Harrison died. Relaxed: McCartney with his late wife Linda hanging affectionately to his arm, taken by fan Richard Porter . Young love: McCartney and his wife Linda caught in an unposed moment, taken by fan John Taylor . Larking around: The McCartneys in New Orleans taken by fan John Taylor as they take a convertible for a spin . Fun encounter: Fan Brian Cunningham with a smart-looking John Lennon and Yoko Ono in July 1976 in New York . 'They said that some 'scruffy guy' asked: ‘Where is a good place to eat? It has all changed around here?’' 'It turned out it was George coming back home one last time and he took a local stranger for a drink to thank him for showing him around.' After the Facebook page became so popular, Dean decided to turn the collection into a book for fans around the world to cherish forever. Johnson said: 'The reaction was unexpected but brilliant and the book has become a valuable source of Beatles history. 'There . have been hundreds of books published that give you a general history . of the band - where they were born, how they grew to fame, but nothing . personal about the real them and what they mean to their fans. 'It’s . the first book to gather their history from the fans’ point of view and . it’s the first book about them to be culled from Facebook. Personal touch: An apology letter from the Beatles to say that a fan could have an advance copy of the latest album in 1969 . Very early gig: Confirmation of the Beatles playing at the YMCA in Birkenhead right at the beginning of their illustrious career . Stories in the book include one from a Pat Jackson, which reads: 'A mate of mine was teaching a McCartney gig. 'The sound manager took everyone aside beforehand and said, ‘You are not allowed to look at Mr. McCartney.' 'You are not allowed to address Mr. McCartney directly. You can only talk to Mr McCartney if he addresses you first’. 'Later on, my mate was laying a cable on the ground. She tried to move one cable and it wouldn’t shift, so she looked up the cable to see what the problem was and saw a foot. '’Hey, shift yer [sic] foot,' said she, and looked up to see McCartney lift his foot up quickly and go, ‘Oh, sorry ‘bout that!’' 'She realised she had mucked up talking to ""the man"", but he seemed genuinely apologetic, so she passed it off. 'Ten minutes later, the sound manager came up to her and said, '‘You’ve got ten minutes. Go down to your locker, get your stuff and get out'.' Treasured memory: McCartney with fan Jonn Lunt, one of 700 contributions from the Beatles' five decades of fame . Team photo: McCartney always looks happy to see Beatles fans, however many thousands of photographs he has posed for in his long career . 'My mate was absolutely horrified . but, not wanting to make a fuss, did what she was told and headed down . to the lockers. She was just packing her stuff when he got a tap on the . shoulder. '’Er, sorry . about that. It wasn’t your fault and we’ve sorted it. You can head back . up to work if you want to’. It was McCartney. 'She went upstairs and continued to work. The sound manager got sacked.' Another tale was by a girl who ran a fan club dedicated to George Harrison. Seeing how much she liked him, he invited her over to England to meet him but when she turned up, he had forgotten their arrangement. George walked out of the house with Eric Clapton and told her he couldn’t see her that day but asked her to come back the following year. She did just that and he took her out for a meal with him. Other contributions to the book include a letter sent from The Beatles to a Peter Brown, dated 16th June, 1969. Decades of adoration: McCartney with fan John Taylor, who was one of hundreds of fans who shared his photographs for the book . Over the moon: Roger Stormo, a fan wearing a John Lennon t-shirt chatting to McCartney in 1982 . Within the letter, the band apologise to Mr Brown for being unable to 'fulfill their original promise of sending him a ticket to a Beatles TV show as a prize for winning the fan club competition.' They go on to say, 'We are really very sorry about this, and have spent a long time thinking of an alternative which would not be a mere consolation for the original prize. 'Anyway, at last we’re able to tell you that your new prize - and we hope you like it - is to be an advance copy of the Beatles new album, which at the moment we’re expecting to release towards the end of August. 'John, Paul, George and Ringo would all like to congratulate you on winning, and hope you will accept their apologies for the delay.' Also submitted to the Facebook site, which can be seen in the published book, are private photos taken by fans. Global appeal: A new generation of fans with Ringo Starr in Argentina . The book, which retails for £8.75, is being launched at The Music of Merseyside exhbition at The Liverpool Academy of Arts, on Monday. Dean added: 'These stories are the other side of Beatlemania. We are peoplemania. 'It is important that we document the fans’ side of the Beatlemania phenomenon.' Dedication: Dean Johnson has compiled a book based on people who have encountered the Beatles .

A group of lifeguards are being investigated for joking on Facebook about a young girl nearly drowning - with one even complaining she had to get her hair wet to save her. One of the lifeguards at Basildon Sporting Village, Essex, posted a status update on her personal Facebook page to tell her friends how a little girl had nearly drowned three times in a single swimming lesson earlier that day. But rather than sounding concerned about the child's welfare, the lifeguard moaned about how she had been forced to get her hair wet when she had to jump in to rescue her. Her colleagues then left a series of comments on the post about the 'funny' incident - with one writing: 'Laugh, I’ve still got a smile on my face. Investigation: Lifeguards at Basildon Sporting Village in Essex are being investigated for allegedly joking about a young girl nearly drowning three times in a swimming class . 'Our faces when we realised she was going down for the third time. Omg, best straddle jump I’ve seen in a while from you!! I’m laughing now, you made my day. What a giggle.' Management company Sports and Leisure Management (SLM), which runs the pool under the name Everyone Active, has launched an internal investigation into the online chat. The conversation on the social networking site starts with one member of staff writing how she never gets her hair wet unless swimming for her own fitness before boasting how she had managed to keep it 'bone dry' throughout the club's swimming lessons. She then tells her friends how one of the pupils 'starts strugglin a bit too much' and she orders another member of staff to pull her out - presumably so she doesn't have to get wet herself. But when the child nearly drowns a second time, she then complains that she was forced to intervene. She wrote: 'Down she goes again but now I can see her eyes lookin at me under the water so in I go fully clothed and get me f** hair wet [SIC].' Describing the moment the child sank for a third time, the same employee wrote: 'We give her a float off to the middle of the land she goes and sinks back in... We lift her out this kid aint goin in again nd I certainly aint f**** jumpin in again [SIC].' The lifeguard adds that when she got out the pool, the other staff were laughing because she got wet, adding: 'im glad i gave you lot of f***** something to laugh about [SIC]'. Facebook post: A female lifeguard posted details about the incident on her Facebook page - but appeared more concerned about getting her hair wet than the child . Her colleagues then left comments telling the lifeguard: 'I can’t believe the same girl was fished out three times lol [laughing out loud].' A female pool worker then added: 'Absolutely fantastic rofpmsl [rolling on the floor p****** myself laughing].' Another wrote: 'It's one of those moments that will make me chuckle when I close my eyes tonight and go to sleep. Definitely made my day. 'Makes me laugh that as swimming teachers we hate getting wet, and you end up soaked and hair wet twice in 5 minutes, classic'. The pool, opened in 2011 as an Olympic training facility, was voted one of the top 50 places to swim in Britain in July 2012 by the Independent. Children’s swimming lessons at the pool cost £45 for 12 weekly classes. Olympic swimmers from Japan trained in the pool for three weeks last summer ahead of the London 2012 Games. The Olympic Torch was carried through the interior of the swimming pool when the flame passed through Basildon last July. Basildon Council said SLM was investigating the comments. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of a disciplinary issue following some comments by SLM staff on a private Facebook page and are satisfied SLM are dealing with it appropriately.' A spokeswoman for SLM confirmed the probe was on-going. She said: 'These matters are currently under internal investigation by the leisure centre.'

A Philadelphia judge . upheld murder charges Wednesday against a fundamentalist Christian . couple in their 8-month-old son’s faith-healing death, saying things . might be different if their toddler hadn't died four years ago ‘under . strikingly similar circumstances.’ Herbert . and Catherine Schaible were still on probation after the 2009 death of . their 2-year-old son Kent, for which they were convicted of involuntary . manslaughter. In April, . Brandon Schable died of pneumonia after the couple decided to pray over . the infant rather than take him in for medical care, according to their . police statements. Their probation required them to seek immediate . medical help if another child was sick or injured. Scroll down for video... Prayed to death? A Philadelphia judge upheld murder charges Wednesday against Herbert and Catherine Schaible in the faith-healing death of their 8-month-old son . ‘They learned in the worst possible . way...exactly what these symptoms could lead to in a child, especially a . young child, if not medically cared for,’ Common Pleas Judge Benjamin . Lerner said, referring to the 2009 death of 2-year-old Kent Schaible. ‘We've been here before...under strikingly similar circumstances.’ Defense . lawyer Bobby Hoof argued that Brandon died just three days after he . came down with cold and flu symptoms and said there was no evidence of . malice, as required for third-degree murder. ‘A reasonable parent probably would wait three days to take their child to a doctor,’ said Hoof. Again? The Schaibles had previously been convicted of manslaughter in the 2009 death of their 2-year-old son under circumstances prosecutors called 'eerily similar' ‘We . tried to fight the devil, but in the end the devil won,' the couple . told homicide detectives investigating Brandon’s death, which could have . been prevented with basic medical care. Lerner seemed especially troubled that Brandon had increasingly labored breathing but still got no medical care. He . compared the current case to that of a parent who repeatedly gave a . child peanut butter despite knowing of a potentially deadly allergy to . it. ‘How many times do you . have to do that again before a child dies, and a jury can infer legal . malice?’ Lerner asked. ‘Is it a second time, or is that not enough? Is . it a third time?’ About a . dozen U.S. children die each year when parents turn to faith healing . instead of medicine, typically from highly treatable problems, according . to experts. Faith-healing: First Century Gospel Church, where the parents are members, says using medicine is a sin . Murderers? Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, announces Herbert and Catherine Schaible would be charged with murder. The judge upheld the charge Wednesday, despite strong objection from the defense . The . Schaibles are third-generation members and former teachers at the First . Century Gospel Church, a small, insular congregation in northeast . Philadelphia. ‘We believe in . divine healing, that Jesus...died on the cross to break the devil's . power,’ Herbert Schaible told homicide detectives after Brandon died. Philadelphia . District Attorney Seth Williams said the care was never given and . decided to bring murder charges against the couple. Their remaining seven children have been placed in foster care. Extreme: Pastor Nelson Clark of the First Century Gospel Church tells followers to shun 21-century medicine for the power of prayer . ‘He . is incarcerated because of his faith,’ said lawyer Bobby Hoof in May . when the couple was ordered held without bail. He described client . Herbert Schaible's mindset as resolute. ‘We . believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and . that he died on the cross to break the devil's power,’ Herbert Schaible . told Philadelphia homicide detectives in April. Medicine, he said, ‘is . against our religious beliefs.’ ‘These . are people who have been brought up in these communities; their beliefs . are reinforced every day,’ said Shawn Francis Peters, a University of . Wisconsin lecturer who has studied faith-healing deaths. ‘They're not trained intellectually to question these doctrines, where . the rest of us might engage in critical inquiry, weighing the benefits . of medicine versus the benefits of prayer,’ he said. Peters . isn't sure that courts have the means to prevent the problem, since . such people don't fear legal punishment, only Judgment Day. Some believe . death ‘is a good outcome,’ given their belief in the afterlife, he . said. ‘They don't want . to harm their children. They're just in this particularly narrow - and . very, very dangerous - way misguided about the potential of medical . science,’ he said. He . believes that ‘empathetic’ intervention, through dialogue between church . and public health educators, could help some ‘get to a point where they . allow their beliefs and practices to evolve.’ But there's also a risk that could backfire, and drive these communities further underground, he said. It is estimated that around a dozen U.S. children die in faith-healing cases each year, a handful of which spawn criminal charges, according to experts. The First Century Gospel Church of Philadelphia’s teachings has clashed with authorities in the past. In 1991, eight children died in a measles outbreak. All the parents were members of either First Century Gospel Church or the nearby Faith Tabernacle of Nicetown which also preaches faith-healing. Dale and Shannon Hickman were part of a string of faith-based healing related deaths in Oregon in recent years. They were sentenced to 6 years in prison in the death of their home-born son in 2011 . In 2011, Dale and Shannon Hickman of Oregon were sentenced to 75 months in prison after turning to faith healing to say their premature newborn, which was born in a family home, died from complications that could have easily been averted with medical care. Also in Oregon, Jeff and Marci Beagley, were sentenced to 16 months in 2010 for the death of their 16-year-old son. The couple refused to use medicine for their son Neil, who was suffering from a preventable urinary tract blockage. Instead, they prayed and used anointing oils in the hope of divine intervention. 'Too many children have died unnecessarily - a graveyard full,' Judge Steven Maurer said at their sentencing. 'This has to stop.' Oregon has since banned faith healing as a defense against murder charges.","Eight-month-old Brandon Schaible died from bacterial pneumonia .

A crafty thief who dressed in smart golfing gear to bluff his way into elite country clubs in order to steal cash and credits cards from the locker rooms has been arrested. Oscar Cabrera, 33, would wear polo shirts, golf pants, spiked shoes and a glove on one hand during his elaborate scam, which police believe he may have carried out at countless clubs across the country. Cops have also arrested his partner in crime Luis Paz, 34, who wouldn’t have blended in quite so easily at 5ft 7inches and 450 pounds and so acted as getaway driver. Caught in the act: Cabrera caught on CCTV footage at Baltusrol and then, right, at Millburn police station in his smart golfing gear . Both men hail from Miami and were caught on CCTV footage last month after carrying out their sting at the exclusive Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey. ‘Based upon their attire, as to be able to blend in with players at the club, it was obvious to my detectives that these suspects may have committed similar crimes in the past,’ and Springfield Police Chief John Cook. At Baltusrol - where the U.S. Open has been played seven times - Cabrera is alleged to have stolen a stash of credit cards from members’ unlocked lockers. He and Paz are then accused of taking the stolen credit cards to at least two nearby stores and purchasing $8,000 in gift cards before their behavior aroused suspicions at a Target store and they promptly left. In his smart golfing gear Cabrera, left, was able to blend in at the country clubs but his large accomplice Paz, right, stayed in their vehicle and was getaway driver . Springfield cops were able to match Target’s surveillance footage to video of the men at Baltusrol and send out an alert. When the duo tried their trick again - on July 20 - it was at the Canoe Brook Country Club in Summit, New Jersey where staff, armed with video images of Cabrera, were ready. ‘He asked for the men’s room, and he walked off when a worker confronted him,’ Capt. Michael Palardy of the Millburn Police Department told the New York Post. ‘He was wandering around the locker room and couldn’t give a straight answer for why he was there.’ A chase ensued, with Cabrera on foot and caddies and other workers in pursuit on foot and in golf carts, Palardy said. Cabrera was caught on CCTV footage carrying out the sting at the exclusive Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey ¿ which has hosted the U.S. Open tournament seven times . Police were called and Cabrera was arrested. His partner Paz escaped, but was apprehended on Aug. 1, in Queens, New York. Cabrera is being held at the Union County jail in Elizabeth in lieu of $200,000 bail, while Paz is awaiting extradition to New Jersey. Authorities are confident that video surveillance from county clubs elsewhere in the country will show that the pair have carried out the same sting before. They have been linked to at least three other country clubs in Jersey - in Manalapan, Edison and Springfield - which were all struck on the same day in June.

Gilmour’s son Gabriel, 16, and daughter Romany, 11, have been cast as extras in the fourth series of the ratings hit. The pair, dressed in 1920s costume, were spotted filming alongside the rest of the cast in Bampton, Oxfordshire, watched by Gilmour, 67, and their mother, Polly Samson.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 13:49 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:17 EST, 7 August 2013 . The trial of the Fort Hood shooter has been abruptly stopped after just one day in session as an attorney has claimed that the Army psychiatrist is purposefully trying to be granted the death penalty for killing 13 people on the Texas military base. A standby attorney in the case said that Major Nidal Hasan, who chose to represent himself in the case without the help of a lawyer, is intentionally trying to get the death sentence for the 2009 rampage. Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, Hasan's lead court-appointed standby attorney, said he is willing to step in and be Hasan's defense lawyer but asked that his responsibilities as co-counsel be minimized if Hasan continues to work toward being executed. It is 'clear his goal is to remove impediments or obstacles to the death penalty and is working toward a death penalty,' Poppe told the judge overseeing the case at the Texas military base. Scroll down for video . Ulterior motives: A standby lawyer is now arguing that Maj. Nidal Hasan (shown here in court on Tuesday) is trying to blow his defense so that he is sentenced to death . Blatant: During his brief opening statements on Monday, Hasan said that all of the evidence would show that he was the shooter, and it is unclear how he plans to defend his actions . Hasan responded: 'I object. That's a twist of the facts.' The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, then cleared the courtroom. Hasan has chosen to act as his own attorney during the military trial at Fort Hood, though he has defense attorneys on standby if he needs them. Admitted shooter: Major Nidal Hasan, seen here in 2010, is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on Fort Hood Army base in 2009 . On Tuesday, he told jurors during a less than 2-minute opening statement that the evidence would 'clearly show' he was the shooter, but that it would 'only show one side.' He also questioned only two of the first dozen witnesses, who included one soldier who was shot seven times during the November 2009 attack on the sprawling Army post. Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. If convicted, he would face the death penalty. Poppe said Hasan was acting as his own attorney in a way that, 'we believe is repugnant to defense counsel and contrary to our professional obligations.' Hasan repeatedly asked the judge to allow him to explain why Poppe's claim was wrong, saying: 'Your honor, Col. Poppe has made an assertion that is inaccurate. I'd like to clarify that.' Osborn paused for nearly half minute before asking that Hasan explain his argument in writing. He said he wouldn't do that. Osborn then closed the courtroom to discuss the matter. No witnesses were called Wednesday. Hasan, an American-born Muslim who was paralyzed after being shot by officers responding to the attack, said he was as a soldier who switched sides in what he described as a war between America and his Islamic faith. Hasan wanted to plead guilty to murder and attempted murder, but military rules forbid guilty pleas in death penalty cases. Precautions: Armed guards (seen here Tuesday) surround the courthouse on the Texas military base . High security: All cars are being checked for explosives as Fort Hood is operating under extreme caution during the trial . Hasan had also asked to argue that he carried out the shooting in 'defense of others,' namely members of the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan, but the judge denied that strategy. His defense strategy still remains unclear. During Tuesday's testimony, he occasionally took notes on a legal pad. While two defense attorneys remained on stand-by, Hasan rarely turned to them for advice. No American soldier has been executed since 1961, and military prosecutors showed that they would take no chance of fumbling details that could jeopardize any conviction down the line. Connected: The government has said that Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen . The long-delayed trial was years in the making after judges in the case had granted a series of delays. A fight over Hasan's beard, which violates military regulations, led to a stay shortly before his trial was expected to begin last year and eventual replacement of the judge. The trial is playing out amid high security at Fort Hood, where armed guards stood in doorways and 15-foot stacks of shock-absorbing barriers obscured the view of the courthouse. Jurors were told to prepare for a trial that could take months, and Hasan, who is in a wheelchair, needs regular breaks.","Maj.

As a 3-month-old girl with a brain tumor battles for her life, an unexpected outpouring of support has come to the Oklahoma newborn from all over America. As her parents Michelle and Steve Dunn have shared their unthinkable struggle on social media like Twitter and Facebook, the internet has responded in kind with a dedicated hashtag, Facebook pages, and widespread fundraising that has so far raised thousands for the Dunns. Now, as Tatum awaits surgery that could save her life, people who’ve never met the little girl or her family are praying for her recovery. Adorable: Tatum Dunn is fighting for her life against a rare kind of brain tumor . The nightmare began when the Dunns noticed their newborn’s head was swelling. Doctors ran tests that brought terrifying results: Tatum had a tumor. The family traveled to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where doctors told them Friday that Tatum likely has desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, a rare type of brain tumor. The tumors most often occur in the first two years of life and are most commonly, though not always, benign. Rare: Michelle and Steve Dunn have seen an outpouring of support since their 3-month-old daughter was diagnosed with desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma . Terrifying: The Dunns' struggle began when they noticed Tatum's head was swelling. Last week, doctors at Memphis's Le Bonheur hospital confirmed her tumor . Surgery was slated for August 6. It was around this time when the remarkable shows of support began. Family and friends sent their well-wishes and donations to the struggling family as they waited, away from home, in Tennessee. Prior to the scary diagnosis, Steven Dunn first used the Twitter hashtag #pray4Tatum on Thursday. Tatum has since gotten her own Twitter account, Pray for Tatum. The hashtag grew quickly. Thanks to Steve’s position as a high school football coach and recruiting coordinator, coaches from 22 states across the country have since tweeted and retweeted in support of the ailing little girl. ‘When you're a coach, you know you're a part of something special, something bigger than yourself,’ Steve’s brother, also a high school football coach, told The Oklahoman. Hopeful: Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma most often occurs in the first year or two of life and is usually, though not always, benign and highly responsive to surgery . Still waiting: Tatum was scheduled for surgery Tuesday, just days after her diagnosis. However, complications with her blood transfusion forced surgeons to reschedule for Thursday . Popular girl: #prayfortatum has been tweeted and retweeted in 22 states and her Facebook page has been liked by thousands of people . At Broken Arrow High School, where Steve coaches football in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, the cheerleading squad and football team raised $2,200 for the Dunns with a car wash. When Tuesday finally came, the thousands who had tweeted, posted, and donated over just a few days were waited for the news. And it came: Due to some complications with the blood transfusion, Tatum’s surgery was rescheduled for Thursday. Fundraisers: At the high school where Steve coaches football, cheerleaders and football players raised $2,200 for the Dunns with a car wash . Widespread: Support showed outside the internet, too. This sign sits out front of the pharmacy where Michelle Dunn works in Oklahoma . Now droves of supporters must wait, though certainly not with the level of fear and uncertainty Tatum’s family must be feeling. Michelle Dunn posted to her daughter’s Facebook Tuesday: . ‘Thank you all for rallying behind us, but today was not the day. Had trouble during transfusion with IV access & time constraints would not have allowed her to go into surgery stable. New plan is 7am Thursday. As let down & exhausted as we are, it's not about us but what is best for Tatum. All in His timing.’ Waiting: Now, as Michelle and Steve await the pushed back surgery date, people across the internet and all over America wait with bated breath, too .

"By . Liz Hodgkinson . PUBLISHED: . 15:48 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:35 EST, 7 August 2013 . Sitting at the kitchen table, a pensive look on her face, I could tell my 11-year-old granddaughter Delilah had something on her mind. 'Don't you like Grandpa Nev?' she asked of my ex-husband, Neville. 'Yes, I do like him,' I replied. 'Then why are you divorced?' 'We like each other,' I tried to explain, 'but we just don't like living together.' As Delilah tried to absorb this, with a puzzled look on her face, I felt a great sadness that two of her loving, doting grandparents couldn't be the traditional granny and grandpa she would clearly love to have. 'My ex and I love the grandchildren equally, but being divorced grandparents means everything has to be done separately' The fact is, I am a prime example of that discomforting modern phenomenon: the divorced grandparent. Unlike the grandparents of old, my ex-husband Neville and I don't have a cosy, easy family home for our grandchildren. We can't offer what they would probably like: a safe, shared refuge, with deep old sofas for them to sink into and memories stretching back into our own childhoods. We cannot give them the experience of two people who have grown old together, who have tolerated each other's funny little ways, and who speak of each other with, mostly, affection. Now that our five grandchildren are growing up - the eldest is 13 - it seems a tragic loss for them that they have to visit us separately in homes that are far from child-friendly. It also means, sadly, that they are forced to come to terms with divorce at an early age. When my husband Neville and I split up in 1988, grandchildren were not even the merest speck on the horizon. It eventually became apparent that we could not co-exist under the same roof, so the divorce at least brought our bloodcurdling rows to an end. And once divorced, we got on fine. Our two sons, Tom and Will, teenagers at the time, seem to have lived their lives unaffected by it all. Our grandchildren though - still lovely, fresh-faced, innocent young people - are another matter. My ex and I love the grandchildren equally, but being divorced grandparents means everything has to be done separately. Liz and Neville with their baby son Tom aged one week in April 1968 . Once, just once since they were born, we managed to take Will's two children to Cotswold Wildlife Park together - after months of planning and co-ordination. The kids absolutely loved being with both their grandparents, and we had enormous fun, too. Joint grandparenting is so much more enjoyable than when you take them out alone. It's jollier, more varied and less lonely for the adult. You can relive the event afterwards, together - in fact, my ex and I always talk about that wonderful day out on the occasions that we do speak. But it was never to be repeated. If I want to have my grandchildren to stay, I do so by myself. If Neville wants to take them to the seaside while they are with me, I drive them to the station to meet him, drop them off, then pick them up later, which is strange and unsettling for them. The reasons for this are both historical and logistical. By the time the grandchildren were born, Neville and I were living in different parts of the country, and could not easily get together anyway. I was also in another relationship and Neville remained resolutely single. Now that my partner, John, has died, I know my grandchildren would secretly like Neville and me to be a nice elderly couple like their other grandparents. Liz with two of her grandchildren, Arthur, left, and Otto, in London . But even though my ex and I remain good friends, too much time has passed for this. It all means that we miss out on many milestones. I don't think we have ever celebrated a grandchild's birthday together - we've been separated for so long that it would feel unnatural to be together at a family gathering. Our sons have got used to scheduling us in separately. We're fine when it's just the two of us, but when the family are present, old slights, hurts and arguments come to the surface, reminding us why we separated. Christmases are another difficult time. My sons always stay with their in-laws rather than descending on me, a lone grandparent living in an upstairs flat. I feel envious of Tom, who every year goes to a big house, where his mother-in-law organises picture-perfect family get-togethers.  Would I like to join in? Yes - I feel extremely left out. It would never even occur to either of my sons to come and stay with me or my ex - the atmosphere would never be the same - so I have never witnessed my grandchildren's excited faces as they open their presents. They tell me about the games played, the walks with the cousins and the way they all reconnect. 'We're fine when it's just the two of us, but when the family are present, old slights, hurts and arguments come to the surface, reminding us why we separated' It would be a deprivation for the families to come to me - even if there was room for them all - so I have to be pleased that at least their other grandparents can give them a fantastic Christmas. It is all a stark contrast to the wonderful, simple relationship my sons and I used to have with my own grandparents. I was happy and relaxed in their home and always look back on them with love and gratitude. I saw my grandparents most days and loved to 'help' my grandfather on his allotment. He would choose the smallest carrots and new potatoes for me and pick the sweetest peas. I chatted to him about World War I and to my gran about going into service at 12 years old. They never seemed to argue. At least, I tell myself, neither of us has remarried, so there is not a step-grandparent for them to get used to - the situation that faces Prince George as he grows up. When my own grandchildren were born, I felt an overwhelming and completely unexpected outpouring of love for them. I am quite indifferent to all non-related babies, however cute they may be - they are not the flesh of my flesh and therefore there is no bond, no attachment. So I could not expect my partner, John, who was still alive when four of my grandchildren were born, to feel the same emotional tug. When you have a non-related partner, you can't do that delicious grandparently thing of cooing over the new baby together to see the family resemblances. Nor will you have the same interest in poring over endless pictures of them, or laughing at their amusing little sayings. 'It's true that I may be a fun, modern, up-to-date granny with the latest computer - but I can never welcome them into the family home where their own parents grew up' In the Royal Family, there have been rumours that Charles gets impatient with Camilla's existing five grandchildren - no wonder; he's not their real grandfather. My grandchildren far prefer to stay with their other grandparents than with me or my ex. They are solid, traditional elderly couples who are still married and who have lived in the same house for decades. My heart sinks when Will tells me they are going to Cornwall, where his wife's parents live, as he does several times a year - it hurts to know the other grandparents have a much closer relationship with the children than I do. His mother-in-law is a wonderful old-fashioned granny, who loves to bake special cakes when she knows they are coming. Tom's in-laws have lived in the same beautiful house for more than 40 years, and the grandchildren love to explore it. Such grandparents, devoted to each other for life, are an increasingly rare breed, probably soon to be replaced by one biological grandparent and a step. And instead of remaining in family homes, the grandparents of tomorrow will move into smart new flats where they don't like to cook in case it messes up the designer kitchen. It's true that I may be a fun, modern, up-to-date granny with the latest computer, 3D TV and surround sound, and I can give them all sorts of treats. But I can never welcome them into the family home where their own parents grew up. And it saddens me beyond measure that this is the case.","Writer divorced husband Neville, with whom she is good friends, in 1988 .

An attorney hired by Erica's adoptive parents, Casey and Sandy Parsons, claimed that his clients were under the impression that the 15-year-old went to live with her biological mother and wanted to be left alone, the Charlotte Observer reported. The lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that two years ago, a person claiming to be a relative or friend of Erica's birth parents came by Parsonses' home on Miller Chapel Road to pick her up and take her to her family. The adoptive parents said they did not raise an alarm at the time because Erica visited that person in Asheville on several occasions. According to Sherrill, In February 2012, Erica called the Parsonses and informed them in no uncertain terms that she was not coming back because she did not want to live with them anymore, Asheville Citizen-Times reported. ‘They looked at it as being a rebellious teenager. That was an attitude they took,’ Sherrill said. ‘I don't know that at any time it dawned on them she was a missing person.’ According to police investigating the case, when they questioned Casey and Sandy Parsons over a two-day period last week, the parents lied to them and were uncooperative. 'Rebellious teen:' Erica, who was adopted by the Parsons family when she was 2 weeks ago, allegedly informed them by phone that she does not want to return home and plans to stay with her birth parents' relatives . Their attorney, however, insists that his clients did not purposefully fabricate anything, but were rather relying information that they believed to be true. Sherrill added that her clients stopped answering questions when detectives began insinuating that that the Parsonses may have played a role in their adopted daughters' disappearance. The lawyer told ABCNews.com that around November 2011, Case and Sandy Parsons got a call from Erica's birth mother, who said she wanted her daughter to come stay with her and another relative in the Asheville area for a while. Erica has been missing since November 19, 2011. On July 30, nearly two years later, her older brother, James Parsons, reported her missing. He told authorities that when he asked about his sister previously, his parents said she had left and moved in with other relatives, the Salisbury Post said. Last sighting: Erica has been missing since November 19, 2011, when she left her adoptive parents' home on Miller Chapel Road in Salisbury . Worst fears: The girl's adoptive grandparents, Janet and Steven Parsons, are afraid that something happened to Erica, and their son, Erica's father, and his wife are not telling them the truth . The 19-year-old said he fears that something may have happened to Erica and his parents are not telling him. According to Sherrill, James Parsons called police after being forced to move out of his parents’ house as punishment for assaulting his family. When the Parsonses, who adopted the girl when she was just 2 weeks old, tried to contact Erica's family in Asheville, they could not be found, suggesting that the names they were given were false, according to the attorney. Erica's grandparents said they too have been asking the Parsonses about the girl's whereabouts, but the parents said the teen was visiting family. ‘I am so worried, I am so worried,’ the grandmother, Janet Parsons, told the station WSOC-TV. Steve Parsons, the girl’s grandfather, said the 15-year-old could not have been reported missing by a school because she was home-schooled. Erica Parsons is described as 4 feet 5 and weighing between 85 and 90lbs. She has brown hair and brown eyes and appears small for her age.","Erica Lynn Parsons, 15, last seen November 19, 2011, leaving adoptive parents' home in Salisbury, North Carolina .

And now Amazon is branching into the fine art arena - and selling off original and limited edition works. Customers can buy works of art from more than 150 prominent galleries and dealers via Amazon Art. Amazon Art is now selling works by Norman Rockwell, along with a host of other well-known artists . Warhol's prints of Chairman Mao are all for sale on the marketplace - and shoppers can pick up a piece of art along with books, music and cookware . Amazon Art features 40,000 works from more than 4,500 artists, with prices ranging from $10 (£6.45) for a screen print to a Norman Rockwell oil painting that costs $4.85 million (£3.1 million). Andy Warhol's screen prints of Mao, the late Chinese Communist dictator, are on sale for $200,000 (£128,949). The wide range of works includes folk art, impressionism and modern art, and potential buyers can search through mediums, prices, subject and style. The online marketplace offers detailed information about the artist, work, provenance and exhibition history. Traditionally, works like Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties and Andy Warhol's portraits would be auctioned off - but now Amazon hopes to bring buyers to its website and change the way art is sold . While many galleries and artists will undoubtedly welcome the prominence the website will bring to them, some feel that online market place's new venture cheapens the art and compromises its integrity. Georgina Adam of the Financial Times and the Art Newspaper said: 'It's demeaning for a high end artist and also for those at the lower end,' the BBC reported. 'A unique piece of art is more than just a product. It is a unique creation. 'I think the way it is sold in the Amazon way devalues it.' Despite the critics, the site is sure to get a lot of attention from budding art collectors, as around 80 million visitors look at the marketplace every month, it was reported in December. The announcement came on Tuesday, a day after Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. announced that its CEO, Jeff Bezos, had purchased The Washington Post. Amazon worked with Sotheby's for a short-lived experiment selling art online in 1999, but then the venture was shut down after 18 months to make way for Sothebys.com. Amazon, which initially sold just books online, was originally founded in Bezos' garage in Bellevue, Washington in 1995. The founder resolved to take full advantage of the internet and begin a dot com company. His gamble paid off - within the first two months of business, Amazon sold to over 45 countries and is now the biggest online retailer in the world.",Selling works by Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol .

An 18-year-old student is suing her former school for allegedly not taking her claims of bullying seriously over a year and a half. Isabella Hankey, known as Belle, claims she went from being a happy student to suffering such anxiety over the death threats scratched into the wall of the school locker room, that she suffered a pulmonary embolism. Belle has filed a $2 million federal civil rights lawsuit against the towns of Concord and Carlisle, the . Concord-Carlisle school district, and three school administrators, . alleging that the school did nothing to stop the bullying, according to The Boston Globe. Bullied: Belle Hankey claims feces were smeared on her car and death threats were carved into the locker room wall . 'I hated walking in the halls, thinking . that you could be walking by the person that hates you. It’s terrifying. You think that it could . be your friends, a stranger, anyone,' she said. The bullying, by a still unknown person, began on Belle's 17th birthday, when she drove to school in a car her parents had bought her as a gift. She told Boston.com that when she finished class she returned to the parking lot to find three deep scratches on her car. A few months later, she found feces smeared on her car and, on another occasion, a vulgar word scratched into her bumper. 'I was in shock. It was disgusting. Who is physically capable of doing something so disgusting?' she said. Belle claimed that her school did nothing to investigate and, when her parents asked for cameras to be installed, they were told it would be too expensive. When she told the assistant principal about the slur carved into her car he allegedly told her, 'I don't know what you want me to do', according to Fox 25. The bullying soon took a more sinister turn, when she found the words 'Kill Belle' scratched into the locker room wall in June last year. Days later, the teenager found another threat carved into the wall that read: 'Belle's dead at 9:15'. Ordeal: The Concord schoolgirl suffered anxiety after receiving death threats in school . Lawsuit: Concord school district is being sued for $2 million by the 18-year-old . When she saw the first death threat, Belle said she was so scared she sat crouched in the toilet stall and was too scared to move. By October the anxiety led to Belle suffering a pulmonary embolism, which doctors said had been caused by stress. Her parents claim their phone calls and e-mails to the school were often not returned. They became so concerned for their daughter's safety that they hired a private investigator and fitted cameras in their daughter’s car. The police were contacted, but they told the parents the school was the best place to deal with the bullying. Belle's mother, Debra Hankey, said: 'She needs to know why this wasn't taken care of. She needs to know why they let her down, why they didn't protect her.' At the time, names of several people who could be behind the threats were put forward, including a group of girls known as the 'Sexy Seven'. However, it is claimed nothing was done to follow up the leads. 'It’s been two years this fall and it’s . unbelievable that no one knows,' she told the Boston Globe. 'When the death threats started . happening, I saw girls going into the office all the time saying, ""I . don’t know if I feel safe in here"".' Belle became so anxious at school that she completed her classes at Rivers and Revolutions, a progam that allowed her to study in a building away from the main school. Even then, the harassment continued. Just before returning after the summer, she found the word 'Ready' carved into her car's bumper. In response to the lawsuit, . Concord-Carlisle High School Principal Peter Badalament said in a . statement: '[The] school district cannot comment on a complaint which it . has not even seen'. He added that the school took bullying seriously. Ordeal: Belle claims the school did not do enough to find the person responsible for the bullying . Concord Schools deputy superintendent John Flaherty told Fox 25: 'We take the issue of harassment very seriously ... the district is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all of our students. Beyond that we have no comments at this time.' The 18-year-old, who plans to study at the University of Mississippi, said the suit was a way to try to prevent others suffering from the same experience. 'I’m definitely still carrying it with me. Hopefully this will help me have some closure on it,' she said.","Isabella Hankey became so anxious she suffered pulmonary embolism .

A researcher in Germany has discovered a major glitch in Xerox copier machines which have shown to substitute the wrong numbers when scanning documents. After scanning a blueprint document from an architect, David Kriesel, a computer science researcher at the University of Bonn in Germany, thought the firm was pulling his leg when they accused him of altering some figures. But sure enough, on three occasions, the number six had been replaced with an eight. Changing numbers: David Kriesel noticed that in some of the numbers he scanned in with a '66' sequence (pictured on the left) they had changed to '86' (pictured on the right) Technical error: Again, the numbers which feature a 6 on the original document (left) have been changed to an 8 (pictured right). The table shows that 54,60 (left) turns into 54,80 (right) and 65,40 (left) becomes 85,40 (right) Outrage: When Mr Kriesel noticed the error and the company explained, he took to Twitter to spread his concern . He told ABC News: I thought they were kidding. But I tried it myself.. and the numbers changed (after being scanned).' Alarmed, Mr Kriesel contacted the U.S. firm, but found no one knew anything about it. In response,  the company's principle engineer posted a five paragraph blog on its website explaining the situation and how to avoid it. Frances Tse said the issue had been detected in certain machines when scan- quality and resolution settings were altered; when files were compressed, and the quality reduced. Each page is scanned as a number of small patches, and the machine replaced each patch with one that best fits from a library of symbols. However, when the file quality is reduced, there is a subsequent 'tradeoff' in accuracy, Mr Tse said. He wrote on his blog: 'The Xerox design utilizes the recognized industry standard JBIG2 compressor which creates extremely small file sizes with good image quality, but with inherent tradeoffs under low resolution and quality settings.' He explains that for 'data integrity purposes', the company recommends using the factory default settings for scanning, with quality level set to 'higher'. 'In cases where lower quality/higher compression is desired for smaller file sizes, we provide the following message to our customers next to the quality settings within the device web user interface: “The normal quality option produces small file sizes by using advanced compression techniques. Image quality is generally acceptable, however, text quality degradation and character substitution errors may occur with some originals."",' he said . Coverage: Mr Krisesl said he thinks the glitch should get some airtime on a late night satirical programme . Numerous Xerox machines are affected by the glitch, including this ColorQube a 87XX / 89XX model . The potential implications of the Xerox scanning glitch could be very serious, especially if they affect construction documents or medical developments, customers point out (stock image of an office) Mr Tse's blog, titled 'Always Listening To Our Customers: Clarification On Scanning Issue' has not been well received however, by those who fear the potential fallback from this issue could be colossal. S. Basinger questioned what will happen when people find engineering documents are released for construction with numbers switched by Xerox’s machines, or medical documents have used with switched figures. 'A lame response like this suggests that some of the ignorance of the consequences may be willful and that your senior leadership is hoping that this will somehow go away,' the comment continues. 'Heaven forbid as time continues to tick away and you delay a proper recall that people die as a result of your inaction.' Others criticise the company for failing to explicitly say which machines are affected, another points out that the warning message did not show up on his machine when he followed the instructions. When one client called the customer services for advice, he found no one knew what he was talking about. In response, Mr Tse later added some extra details in answer to his blog comments. He pointed out that the product families affected were numerous: ColorQube 87XX / 89XX, ColorQube 92XX / 93XX, WorkCentre 57XX, WorkCentre 76XX, WorkCentre 58XX, WorkCentre 77XX, WorkCentre 5030/5050, WorkCentre 6400, WorkCentre 78XX, WorkCentre 51XX, WorkCentre 7220/7225, WorkCentrePro 2XX / BookMark 40/55, WorkCentre 56XX and WorkCentre 75XX . He also drew attention to the fact that unless default settings had not been changed, the problem would not arise. He said the company was taking the issue very seriously. He said from people's feedback 'we will look for ways to help our customers better manage their scanning application needs'. German researcher Mr Krisesl, who has spoken to both Mr Tse and Xerox's vice president Rick Dastin, is still concerned about the consequences. He told ABC News: 'This problem is dangerous. If something is compressed with JBIG2 and I claim it's incorrect, you can't prove me wrong.'","Documents were changed when they were compressed, Xerox found .

A restaurant that claims to be 'family-friendly' has angered regulars after it issued a diktat banning children under eight years old after 7pm. La Fisheria, in Houston, Texas, which has a colorful cartoon fish as a logo and offers a children's menu, announced its new policy on Monday via its Facebook page. The post reads: 'After 7:00 pm, people over eight years old only. . . Family friendly? La Fisheria, in Houston, Texas, has angered regulars after it issued a diktat banning children under eight years old after 7pm . 'We are a family friendly restaurant, and we also respect all of our . customers so we introduce this new policy to the restaurant. Thanks for your understanding.' The restaurant has also posted a sign on its door reaffirming the policy. Explaining the decision, La Fisheria executive chef Aguiles Chavez told local news station KHOU 11 that many diners had complained about 'noisy and rowdy' behavior from children in the restaurant. 'We find children that are crying, some kids running under tables, and . our customers don’t like, he said. 'Seven o’clock is not a time for . children, especially when we serve drinks and wine.' 'Seven o’clock is not a time for . children, especially when we serve drinks and wine' The Facebook post sparked a strong reaction from locals, generating over 400 comments. And while some customers have welcomed the new rule, others are furious. One comment on the La Fisheria Facebook page read: 'Wow that's a good one. You can't be ""family friendly"" if you don't allow . all families to participate. And you can't respect ""all"" your customers . if you tell ""any"" of your customers they can't dine at a certain time.' Another read: 'I find it ironic they say family friendly, when the new rule is anything but that.' Some . commenters feel is is important to expose youngsters to a formal dining . environment, and La Fisheria denies them that opportunity. 'So, kids can't eat . dinner at a normal time? They're not senior citizens,' argued one. 'I could understand after 9pm, but I think . it's important to show my child that there is culture and learning . experiences in cuisine that stretches beyond chain restaurants.' To welcome kids or not to welcome kids? La Fisheria announced its new policy via its Facebook page on Monday, sparking a debate among its regulars . One critic also queried how the restaurant plans to enforce such a rule: How can you differentiate between a . small 9 and 10 year old and a tall 6 or 7 year old?' they wrote. 'Are parents now . required to bring their child's birth certificate with them to verify . age? Will servers now be required to make an intelligence and speech . assessment?' A large number of local diners were in favor of La Fisheria's decision though. Indeed, its Facebook post generated over 400 'likes', and many were from parents with young children. 'I think crying babies can ruin the . entire meal for anyone close by, and unruly children can, too. I agree . with this restaurant totally' One commenter wrote: 'I have three children under the age of . eight and I think you have a great idea! My kids should not be out at a . restaurant after 7pm anyway, and if I happen to get a night free with my . husband, I appreciate the ""calm and quiet"" that a kid-free environment . brings.' Another said: 'I think crying babies can ruin the entire meal for anyone close by, and unruly children can, too. I agree with this restaurant totally.' And even a former restaurant worker weighed in: 'I am a mom of a now 13 and 16 year old, they too get annoyed with children that can't behave in public! I have been in the food and beverage industry for over 20 years and this policy is a God send! One of my pet peeves is poorly raised children.' And indeed Mr Chavez says that feedback in the restaurant has been positive. 'When we explain, they say you’re right, at the end of the day, you’re thinking of us,' he said. La Fisheria says it will continue to serve its kids' menu until 7pm, then customers may dine in a child-free environment until the 10pm closing time.","La Fisheria, in Houston, Texas, has a colorful cartoon fish as a logo and offers a children's menu .

Ted Cruz is mad as hell at the IRS and it's not going to take it anymore: the conservative legislator wants the tax agency gone for good . Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is a conservative's conservative, and the IRS's rampant political favoritism has brought him back to one of this signature campaign issues: getting rid of the tax collection agency for good. 'In recent weeks the IRS has admitted to unlawfully targeting conservative groups, and trying to silence the president's critics,' he says in a Web video launched May 27. Federal legislators, he says 'need to make sure it never happens again. It's time to abolish the IRS.' The video, which also ran last week as an audio-only ad during Sirius/XM simulcasts of Fox News Channel programs, was produced by the Senate Conservatives Fund, a wealthy political action committee that spent $3.5 million on candidate races in the 2012 election cycle. That amount put it in the top 13 percent of big-money PACs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Cruz's senate campaign was the fund's second biggest recipient, taking in more than $315,000. Only Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, who failed in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, received more money from the political committee. But it seems Cruz himself, not the Republican-leaning fund, is driving his embrace of a doomsday scenario for America's widely feared tax collection agency. 'The senator has spoken about this since his campaign,' Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told MailOnline. 'He believes that our tax code should be simple enough that there would be no need for an agency like the IRS,' Frazier said. 'This is an issue of principle.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Cruz told Fox News host Eric Bolling on Monday that he's dead serious about his call to put the IRS out of business . The Senate Conservatives Fund launched AbolishIRSnow.com to host Cruz's video. That PAC spent more than $3.5 million on political races in 2012 . In a Fox News interview with Cashin' In host Eric Bolling on Sunday, Cruz contended that Barack Obama's presidency gave the IRS's recent history of unethical behavior greater urgency. 'The Obama administration has demonstrated a willingness to use the machinery of government to target their political enemies, and that's wrong,' he said. 'It was wrong when Richard Nixon did it, and it's wrong when Barack Obama did it.' 'It is a manifestation of too much power in the federal government,' Cruz continued. 'When the federal government has that much power in our individual lives, it's an invitation to being abused. The articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included the allegation that he tried 'to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner' Writer Dean Koontz (L) gave $5,000 to the Senate Conservatives Fund, which donated $315,000 to Cruz's 2012 Senate campaign, and launched a video in which he calls for the IRS to be shuttered permanently. Carnival cruise lines CEO Micky Arison (R) donated $1,500. 'I think we ought to abolish the IRS and instead move to a simple flat tax, where the average American can fill out our taxes on a postcard,' Cruz told Bolling,' saying Americans should be able to 'put down how much you earn, put down a deduction for charitable contributions, for [a] home mortgage, and how much you owe.' Taxpayers, he said, should be motivated to 'take the [IRS] agents, the bureaucracy out of Washington, and limit the power of government.' He also had strong words for the Obama administration's planned use of the IRS to administer the president's signature health care overhaul law, the Affordable Care Act. Lois Lerner, head of the IRS unit that decides whether to grant tax-exempt status to groups, was placed on paid suspension after she refused to tell Congress what she knew about the extra scrutiny the IRS gave to tea party and other conservative groups that applied for tax-exempt status . 'Right now the IRS is creating the largest database in the country to implement Obamacare,' Cruz claimed, 'and the intrusion into our personal lives, I think is unacceptable.' 'The pattern we’ve seen is its not something we can trust will be administered in a fair way. It’s not something we can trust won’t be used in a partisan way.' The idea of an IRS-run health care database has been a hotly contested one, with liberal advocates calling the suggestion false on its face. But the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote on May 14 that the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services are 'now building the largest personal information database the government has ever attempted.' 'Known as the Federal Data Services Hub, the project is taking the IRS's own records (for income and employment status) and centralizing them with information from Social Security (identity), Homeland Security (citizenship), Justice (criminal history), HHS (enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data) and state governments (residency). 'The data hub,' according to the Journal, 'will be used as the verification system for Obamacare's complex subsidy formula.' Tea party groups staged protests against the IRS in more than a dozen cities on May 21. The agency has acknowledged using political criteria to target some applicants for tax-exempt status . The Senate Conservatives Fund, the PAC that launched Cruz's video campaign, has collected contributions of $200 or more from 7,765 people, according to Federal Election Commission disclosure reports. Among those donors are author Dean Koontz and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, who gave $5,000 each; Google vice president Milo Medin, who contributed $2,500; and Carnival cruise lines CEO Micky Arison, who gave $1,500.","A political action committee that gave Sen.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘I cannot see why the BBC is paying £6million of licence fee-payers’ money to a developer for an empty building, and at the same time paying the developer’s clean-up costs. ‘This looks like another example of bad stewardship of public money by the BBC. ‘It has been suggested to me that the BBC is being forced to sell and then rent back some of its properties to fill the financial black hole left by the construction of New Broadcasting House, its lavish new central London HQ.’ New home: The BBC moved to New Broadcasting House five miles away . The BBC has already admitted it will rent back a ‘significant part’ of the 14-acre site, even though it has spent more than £1billion revamping Broadcasting House just five miles away in Central London. This was despite assurances when Television Centre was first put on the market in 2007. At the time, the BBC said: ‘This is a full-scale disposal and we won’t be leasing it back.’ In fact, the BBC will pay £3.6million a year from 2015 to rent three studios. The cost will be covered by the BBC’s commercial subsidiaries rather than from the licence fee. In addition, it will pay an estimated £60million removing broadcasting equipment, satellite aerials and circuits from Television Centre over the next two years. Opposed: Sir Michael Parkinson, left, and David Mitchell, right, were two of the television personalities fiercely opposed to the BBC move . It is believed the high cost is driven by the difficulty of completing the move without disrupting normal TV service. The costs mean the BBC risks losing its overall profit on the sale. Mr Wilson added: ‘The profit the BBC claims to have made on the sale of Television Centre will be all but wiped out by the costs of transferring and replacing equipment. ‘I suspect the BBC will end up making a loss once the amount paid by the developer is whittled down by such hidden costs.’ Stanhope paid £200million for a 999-year lease on the site last July. It plans to develop a hotel, office space, leisure facilities and up to 1,000 apartments. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Television Centre is not empty. There is vital technology and equipment without which we could not broadcast. 'The short-term cost of unavoidable decommissioning work is more than offset by the savings that moving will deliver. In addition to the profit on the sale, the BBC will save £30million a year on running the site.’","The BBC justified the move by claiming it would profit £78millionfrom sale .

An ice cream seller has been warned he could be evicted for serving cones with a flake - because it breaches the terms of his lease. Alex Mills, 23, has operated milkshake bar Shake and Bake on Bognor Regis promenade in West Sussex for three years. But he has become embroiled in a battle with Arun District Council over the ice creams he has also been selling to customers. Fuming: Milkshake bar owner Alex Mills says he cannot understand why he isn't allowed to sell ice creams with a flake . Licensing bosses say out of fairness to other outlets on the seafront, he should not be selling traditional '99' ice cream cones with a flake. Mr Mills was sent a letter informing him a customer had been spotted eating one sold from his shop and that this was a violation of the terms of his lease. He was warned to cease selling such ice creams or face enforcement action including the forfeiture of his lease. Mr Mills said: 'It just seems like one big joke to me and I’ll fight it all the way. Apparently in my lease it says I can sell ice cream but I can’t sell it with any additives, such as flakes, sauce or sprinkles. 'The crazy thing is I can sell them separately but not together. It is ludicrous. If I do sell them together I have been told enforcement action will be taken.' Dispute: Council bosses say it is not fair on other seafront outlets if Mr Mills also serves ice creams with a flake . He added: 'When people buy an ice cream the majority of them want a flake to go with it - if I had to tell them ""sorry, I can sell you the ice cream but not with a flake"", I would lose about 80 per cent of my business. 'I got a letter from the council which said I was spotted selling an ice cream which had a flake and red sauce on it. It says it will be looked into and enforcement action, which could include the forfeiture of my lease, could be taken.' Town mayor Paul Wells has hit out at the ban, saying: 'It is ludicrous you can sell an ice cream and not a flake to go with it.' A spokesman for Arun District Council said: 'We like to have a balance of concessions along Bognor Regis seafront and Mr Mills freely entered into a lease with the council last year to operate his milkshake concession. 'He personally negotiated and agreed the terms of the lease. The council has not varied the terms of his lease since it was agreed. The council has been in lengthy discussions with Mr Mills on a variety of other lease issues over many months. 'As he has very recently demonstrated an apparent willingness to work within the terms of his agreement, the council has agreed to a minor variation to what he can sell from his concession as long as he complies fully with the terms of his lease.' The spokesman added that the lease allowed Mr Mills to sell soft vanilla ice cream, but not put any signs up to advertise this out of fairness to other existing concessionaires.","Alex Mills, 23, sells '99' cones from milkshake bar on Bognor Regis seafront .

Smiling for the camera, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and one-time presidential candidate Wesley Clark cuddles up to his rumoured new love, fashion entrepreneur Shauna Mei - who is nearly half his age. The 68-year-old former General was more than happy to pose with 30-year-old Shauna Mei at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, last September - the same month that he filed for divorce from Gertrude, his wife of 46-years. The image was posted up on the Facebook page on September 5, 2012, for Miss Mei's fashion site AHAlife.com, with the message 'Meanwhile, down in Charlotte, Shauna is hanging out with General Wesley Clark at the DNC'. General Clark filed for divorce in Arkansas on September 11, 2012. The 38-year age difference has not stopped the pair from being seen publicly and looking 'affectionate' - and their latest venture out to the Hamptons, an exclusive beach getaway in New York, all but confirmed their relationship. Scroll down for videos . Dating? General Wesley Clark and fashion entrepreneur were first pictured together at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September 2012 . Odd couple: Wesley Clark, 68, is now reportedly dating Shauna Mei, 30 . At his side: Gertrude, who goes by Gert, was a fixture during his brief presidential campaign in 2004 . Video source www.JingLiUS.com . They were also pictured together at the 2013 Apex for Youth Inspiration Awards Gala in New York in May, with Miss Mei in a form-fitting red gown and Clark in a smart tux. Clark also accompanied his new love to a New York fashion show in February and a friend told MailOnline: 'Shauna was very secretive about their relationship at that time. 'I'm not surprised by her dating older men but a bit surprised by so much older!' Clark, who is known best for his leading role in ending the Kosovo war, filed for divorce from his wife Gertrude, with whom he has a son Wes Jr, last year and put an end to their 46-year marriage. Now Clark and Miss Mei are being more open about their burgeoning romance. In an interview in September 2010 with the Wall Street Journal, Miss Mei revealed she was living with a boyfriend in New York, but said she did not feel pressure to get married, adding: 'It's like a rule of thumb: You have to live with them before you decide. 'Marriage is not something that has to happen.' However, in an interview  last year, she said that she was single. A witness told The New York Post that the new couple were spotted making slight public displays of affection during a recent trip to the Hamptons. The spy said they 'looked very affectionate, it was clear they were a couple. They were holding hands, they were not trying to hide their relationship.' Heyday: Clark held a number of different leadership positions in the military over his storied career, including heading the U.S. forces in the Middle East and taking charge of the Kosovo war . Different line of work: Mei (second from left) started luxury sale site AHAlife.com after working as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs . Miss Mei was born in Mongolia and raised in China before moving to the United States. She worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before leaving to venture into fashion merchandising, and she founded her luxury sale site. Their beach getaway was not the only time that odd couple has been spotted together, as they attended an awards gala together one week after his divorce trial was scheduled. Since retiring from the military in 2000, Clark's home base has been in Little Rock, Arkansas where he grew up. Moving on: In September, Clark filed for divorce from his wife Gertrude (seen together in 2004) after 46-years of marriage . Minor win: Clark, seen here with Gertrude, won the New Hampshire primary in 2004 but went on to lose the nomination to John Kerry . The Post alleges that he stays with Mei whenever he visits her in New York, though neither would release a public comment about their relationship. Miss Mei is not the only woman that Clark has shown his support for in recent months. Clark, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2004, made a very early endorsement for his friend Hillary Clinton should she choose to run as the party's nominee. He made his announcement in a June email sent to supporters of the 'Ready for Hillary' political action committee, and cited her international experience as one of her major strengths. The endorsement comes as little surprise, as he backed her during her failed 2008 bid, and he is close with former President Bill Clinton from their work in the Kosovo war.","General Wesley Clark is believed to be dating fashion entrepreneur Shauna Mei just months after divorcing his wife of 46 years .

After persuading shopkeepers to let him in, Vasile Bogdan, 35, was followed into the stores by his sledgehammer-wielding accomplices. They smashed glass display cabinets before grabbing valuable gold items and fleeing the scene. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Thief Vasile Bogdan cross-dressed as woman to help gang gain entry into jewellery shops . The Romanian raider wore a black wig, skirt and fur hat and coat while he acted as a lookout. Bogdan was today jailed for ten years after being caught by police during the gang’s fifth raid in January this year. The bandit claimed he was a penniless jobseeker, but investigations revealed he had been travelling to and from his native Romania between raids. Sentencing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Richard Marks QC said: ‘It very much looks as though these robberies were, so far as you were concerned, in the nature of a business trip. ‘It is very obvious you were able to fund these journeys backwards and forwards to Romania from your ill-gotten gains from your involvement in these robberies. ‘Moreover, I am driven to the conclusion that you came here for the express purpose of involving yourself in these robberies, which were unquestionably highly planned and carried out with determination and professionalism.’ Det Con Darren Guntrip, of the Met’s Flying Squad, compared Bogdan's cross-dressing role to that of Dustin Hoffman's 1980s comedy film character, Tootsie. He said of Bogdan’s role in the robbery gang: ‘Tootsie would have been proud.’ The Eastern European gang targeted four Asian jewellery stores in east London between November 2012 and January this year. Targeted: The gang first struck at Lakshmis Jewellers in High Street North, Manor Park . They first struck at Lakshmis . Jewellers in High Street North, Manor Park, on November 25 and hit . Lasani Jewellers in Plashet Grove, East Ham on December 4. A further raid followed at Satyan in Green Street, Upton Park, on December 22. The gang also tried to rob Gold City in Stratford Road, Birmingham, but were foiled when the store’s smokescreen was activated. Bogdan was arrested after the gang hit Kowaj Jewellers in Bethnal Green on January 25. Bystander Mohammed Alim tipped off police after seeing him remove his wig before stepping into a coffee shop. He was arrested by police when he emerged minutes later. Mr Alim was awarded £100 by the judge, who said: ‘Without this particular gentleman’s assistance and vigilance, unquestionably this defendant would not have been arrested.’ Up to ten other gang members are thought to be still at large. Held: Bogdan was arrested after the gang hit Kowaj Jewellers in Bethnal Green, pictured . Brereton Horne, defending, claimed Bogdan had only met the other men while looking for construction work and had yet to be paid for his part in the plot. But the judge said he could not accept this when he had paid for flights home. The court heard Bogdan also has four convictions for theft in his homeland, where he has served jail terms totaling seven years. The judge said: ‘Although it is right to say that none of the shopkeepers were physically hurt or indeed threatened, I have little doubt that in the case of each of these offences the shopkeepers and other individuals in the stores must have been absolutely terrified by what they witnessed. ‘These were planned, professional robberies involving a significant degree of sophistication.’ Bogdan, who has no fixed address in the UK, admitted conspiracy to rob.","Cross-dresser in wig, skirt and fur coat persuaded shopkeepers to let him .

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the Conservatives were 'haemorrhaging' membership because Cameron and his 'remote clique' at Westminster were not listening to ordinary people's views . The Conservative Party last night point blank refused to reveal how many members it has amid claims the total may have plummeted below 100,000. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the party was ‘haemorrhaging’ membership because David Cameron and his ‘remote clique’ at Westminster were not listening to the views of ordinary people. Meanwhile UKIP has seen membership soar to as many as 40,000 as the party captures the attention of former Tories with its anti-EU rhetoric. Tory central office said it never commented on its membership figures, prompting critics to claim the silence must mean they are ‘horrific’. Former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft tweeted: ‘We still have not received the membership numbers for the Conservative Party. 'Sadly I suspect it’s really bad.’ Labour and the Liberal Democrats both publish membership figures. Although both have seen numbers fall, the Labour figure of 187,537 is still far higher than the rumoured Conservative total. A Labour source said: ‘Tory chairman Grant Shapps is repeatedly refusing to answer straightforward questions about their membership. ‘While we have a healthy membership . gearing up to knock on doors at the next election, the Tories’ silence . indicates they will face real problems.’ Membership going down the pan, David? Tory central office said it never commented on its membership figures, prompting critics to claim the silence must mean they are 'horrific' Although they will not reveal membership figures, the Tories’ accounts do say how much money is raised from membership fees, which suggest that numbers have fallen. In 2012, the total amount raised in fees was £747,000 – down 28 per cent from the £1,031,000 two years earlier. Meanwhile, some Tory associations have revealed their membership figures, many of which were very low. For example, marginal Halesowen and Rowley Regis in the West Midlands has only 79 members. Such tiny levels of support make it very difficult to raise money for local campaigns or get enough people to knock on doors during elections. Mr Carswell – whose Clacton constituency has seen membership soar 60 per cent since the election – said some associations existed only on paper because there were so few supporters willing to pay up. Former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft tweeted: 'We still have not received the membership numbers for the Conservative Party. Sadly I suspect it's really bad' He told the BBC’s Newsnight programme: ‘We’re still doing politics like it’s the 1950s and we wonder why we’re haemorrhaging membership. ‘It matters enormously if political parties shrivel because if they exist only on paper, as I’m afraid in many Conservative associations is now the case, what you end up with is a remote clique in Westminster who run the party as private property with a few local franchises, and people feel disengaged.’ Mr Carswell said people did not want to join up because party members no longer had any power, unlike in the 1970s and 1980s when they could vote on policies at annual conferences. He continued: ‘It’s a little bit like those banks that don’t want to reveal what’s on their balance sheet because there’s some bad news lurking there. ‘I suspect it is going to be horrific. I suspect it is going to be lower than 100,000 but if we fess up to if we can start to fix it.’ Meanwhile Paul Goodman, from the Conservative Home activists website, said he believed membership was between 100,000 and 130,000. Writing on Conservative Home, he said: ‘Ed Miliband wants trade union members to be able to opt into Labour Party membership. ‘There are roughly six million members of trade unions in the United Kingdom. Were even a paltry five per cent of them to join Labour as individual members, its membership could climb to three times that of the Conservatives. ‘There is no time like the present for David Cameron to face up to the fact that the party is dying on its feet, and act to revive it.’ Tory central office says it is impossible to provide a figure because the information is largely held by local associations who hold the overwhelming majority of memberships locally. They say a comprehensive picture is difficult to ascertain due to the fact that most local associations provide their figures only when it comes to a leadership ballot, the last of which was held in 2005 when Mr Cameron was elected. Membership was then around 260,000. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The Party does not comment on its membership figures.’","Conservative Party last night refused to reveal how many members it has .

The Serious Fraud Office has lost thousands of pages of confidential evidence obtained during its high profile probe into defence giant BAE Systems. In a major breach of data protocol, 32,000 pages of documents, 81 tapes and several computer files were wrongly sent to the wrong owner. The extraordinary blunder relates to the huge investigation into a £43billion BAE deal to supply more than 100 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and heaps pressure on Attorney General Dominic Grieve. David Green, director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), ordered a wide-ranging review after the scale of the data blunder came to light . David Green, the director of the SFO, . asked former Parliament’s former director of security Peter Mason to . conduct an urgent review of the incident. The inquiry ended in 2010 when a deal was reached in which BAE agreed plead guilty to a breach of accounting rules over allegations of bribery during arms and equipment sales. Anyone who provides evidence to the SFO is able to ask to have it returned when a probe has been completed. But at some point between May and October last year a vast cache of data – a total of three per cent of all the evidence gathered during the case – was wrongly sent to an unnamed individual or organisation. But the error involving documents from 58 different courses only came to light in May this year, a year after it could have happened. Emily Thornberry, Labour’s shadow attorney general, said: 'This is government incompetence of the first magnitude. 'The SFO has stumbled from shambles to shambles, with the Attorney General completely failing to get a grip. 'Incompetence like this threatens to have an impact on the reputation of the UK and its relations overseas. 'People . will be wondering how many other skeletons there are in the SFO . cupboard that the Attorney General is aware of but is declining to make . public. The Government needs to get a grip, get to the bottom of this . mess and come clean about exactly what went wrong and how.' The SFO stressed that no material . which could endanger national security was included in the data loss and . the conviction in the case still stands. A wide-ranging review of the way the . SFO handles highly sensitive confidential information has been ordered . to prevent a repeat of the mistake. BAE Systems was investigated over allegations of corruption in relation to arms deals around the world . The Serious Fraud Office started its investigation into BAE in 2004. The investigation, which was prompted by allegations received concerning a defence contract with Saudi Arabia, ultimately also included contracts between BAE and a number of other countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and South Africa. The SFO investigation relating to Saudi Arabia was discontinued in December 2006 in the interest of national security. BAE agreed a settlement in February 2010 with the US Department of Justice in relation to contracts with Saudi Arabia and central and eastern Europe, and with the SFO in relation to a Tanzania contract. The FTSE 100 giant was fined £500,000 at Southwark Crown Court in December 2010 after admitting it had failed to keep adequate accounting records in relation to the defence contract for the supply of an air traffic control system to the government of Tanzania. A . Serious Fraud Office spokesperson said: 'The SFO is dealing with an . incident of accidental data loss. No material relating to national . security was included in the data. ‘Any loss of data is a serious matter and the SFO has taken action to ensure no further material can be wrongly sent out.' To date 98 per cent of the missing date has been retrieved, and the SFO thinks the rest may have been destroyed. Mr Mason's review concluded that the data leak was accidental and not a deliberate attempt to share information with interested parties in the case. He recommended designated staff being made responsible for the ongoing ownership of data in concluded cases, a re-drafting of the responsibilities of the SFO’s Senior Information Risk Owner and raising the profile of data handling as a key risk in the SFO’s work. The spokesman added: ‘The SFO has a duty to return material to those who supplied it, upon request, after the close of an investigation. ‘In this instance the party requesting the return was sent additional material which had in fact been obtained from other sources. ‘The data constituted 3 per cent of the total data in the case.  It consists of 32,000 document pages, 81 audio tapes and electronic media. ‘Of this, 98 per cent of the material has been recovered and efforts continue to recover all the remaining material that has not already been destroyed by the recipient.’ BAE Systems, Europe's biggest defence company, was fined £250million by the United States and Britain in 2010, following long-running corruption investigations at home and abroad into defence deals in Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Hungary. A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said: 'The Attorney General's office is aware of this incident and takes this issue extremely seriously. 'We are working with the new management team at the Serious Fraud Office to ensure all possible steps are taken to ensure that this incident is not repeated. 'The Attorney General supports the package of measures taken by the Director of the SFO following this incident which will help improve the way that the organisation handles information in the future.'","Documents, tapes and data files from 58 sources sent to wrong owner .

Debate: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has reignited the issue of Britain's foreign aid contributions with his infamous 'Bongo Bongo land' comments . David Cameron yesterday weighed into the row over an MEP’s ‘Bongo Bongo land’ comments by describing them as ‘offensive’ and ‘wrong’. Despite Godfrey Bloom being rebuked for his outburst by UKIP party bosses, he again refused to apologise for the remarks. The Prime Minister criticised Mr Bloom by describing Britain as a ‘very open, international country’. ‘I think it’s an offensive remark anyway, but I think that where he’s wrong is this sort of “stop the world I want to get off” approach – it just doesn’t work,’ he told the BBC’s Breakfast programme. ‘The problems elsewhere come and visit us so it makes sense to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve those problems at source.’ As the Prime Minister defended Britain’s international aid programme, one minister claimed that other members of the Government had been banned from commenting publicly on the issue. ‘We were told unequivocally not to criticise or get drawn into it’, the minister said. ‘We were told to just say it’s UKIP’s problem because we know when you strip away the “bongo bongo” comment, the public agree with him. ‘Our policy on international aid is unsaleable.’ Mr Bloom told supporters in the Midlands in July that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it’. The 63-year-old MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber is recorded saying: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month when we’re in this sort of debt to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ Condemnation: The Prime Minster said Mr Bloom's comments were offensive and wrong . Yesterday, Mr Cameron said there was a ‘totally legitimate debate to be had about whether it’s right to keep our promises on overseas aid’. He said Britain had promised ‘the poorest people in the world’ donations worth 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2015 ‘to eradicate appalling diseases’. As well as the moral case, he said ‘there’s actually a national self-interest that if we invest in these countries, for instance Somalia, we can stop the mass migration of more and more people turning up at our shores’. Mr Bloom, appearing on ITV yesterday, said his comments were ‘not racist at all’ and bizarrely claimed that the word bongo meant a ‘white antelope that lives in the forest’. He said: ‘Bongo land is the land of the antelope.’ Bongo is a type of antelope found in central Africa, but it is in fact a red-brown colour. Mr Bloom found support last night from Tory backbencher Philip Davies. ‘I wouldn’t have used those words but in terms of the substance of what he said, I don’t doubt the majority of the public would agree with him and I certainly do,’ he said. ‘Godfrey Bloom says he didn’t mean any offence so I’m happy to take his word on that.’","Cameron describes Britain as a 'very open, international country'

Unsurprisingly, cash-strapped parents are questioning why gadgets are necessary. Mother of three Maria Dawson, 42, from Southampton said: 'Two of my . children have smartphones and that means they are taking hundreds of . pounds worth of equipment to school. Change: Half of all schoolchildren now own smartphones, but 1980s children had to make do with pencils . 'All of their friends had them and, . children being children, that meant they were constantly asking for them . so they would be up to date.

But it’s not all doom and gloom for parents as they add up the costs of sending their children to school. The cost of books, lunchboxes and stationary has actually fallen. Three exercise books in the 1980s would have cost parents £2.40, while today they cost 60p less at £1.80. Lunchboxes are now £1.40 cheaper, costing £4.20, while a calculator now costs £8.70, compared to £11.60 in the 1980s. A John Lewis spokesman said: 'The good old fashioned exercise book and pencils have made it into the top three must-have school bag items for the last 50 years. 'But there’s no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and classroom. 'Technology is evolving at such a rate that we predict in another 10 years’ time the top 10 school bag list will be unrecognisable as today’s digital natives grow up and become parents themselves.

Then she realised the same workers were busy digging up another drive a few doors down - the one they were supposed to have done in the first place. Sean Cane, owner of Ben Driveways, in Leigh, Essex, admitted it was his blunder and had sent the men to the wrong address. Mrs Tworogal made a frantic call to husband, Christopher, 37, before discovering the 'culprits' had set to work on another driveway further down her road. Mrs Tworogal, who'd been away for five hours, said: 'I came home from work to find my driveway had been completely ripped up. 'I simply could not believe my eyes. I called my husband and was screaming down the phone that someone had torn our drive up. 'I went to a neighbour to see if they had seen anything.

'We were going to do it anyway, but just not so soon! And I've even paid a bit more to get an upgrade so I will soon have a nice cobbled driveway.' Sean Cane, owner of the company, carried the can for the mix-up. He said: 'The guys just went to the wrong house after I gave them the wrong number. I got mixed up with another job. 'When I got a call from the customer asking where we were I thought it was strange and then realised they were at the wrong house. 'I went up there to sort it out for her. We will be putting in a new drive for her later this week and, yes, she has gone for an upgrade.' Mr Cane, 46, added: 'She was very nice about it. Some people would have got more angry but she took it well. I don't think they guys would have dug it up if it hadn't looked so bad. I think she is pleased she is getting a new drive.'

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:16 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:53 EST, 8 August 2013 . The Home Office was last night accused of an ‘immigration cover-up’ after parts of a highly critical border security report were blacked out. A total of 15 passages were redacted from a study into border controls in Calais on the grounds that publishing them would be ‘undesirable for reasons of national security’. It is the first time that a regular report by the chief inspector of borders and immigration John Vine has had significant sections withdrawn from public view by Home Secretary Theresa May. Redactions: The Home Secretary Theresa May has been accused of a cover up after parts of a critical report were blacked out . Among the details erased from the report is the number of illegal migrants sneaking into Britain on Eurostar trains from Brussels. The so-called ‘Lille loophole’ allows migrants to stay on the train through France without showing any documentation because they are in the EU’s free travel zone, and then arrive at St Pancras to claim asylum. Other passages were blacked out in sections dealing with concerns over staff shortages at Britain’s main immigration posts in Calais. Meanwhile, the unredacted parts of the report contained worrying signs of mounting pressures on border controls in Calais which check passengers using ferries to the UK. Labour immediately seized on the redactions. Labour’s immigration spokesman Chris Bryant called on Mrs May to share the report in full with the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. He said: ‘This cover-up and the failure at our borders provide yet more dents in this Government’s much-tarnished credibility. What possible reason can there be for redacting elements of a report by a highly respected independent inspector? ‘This is a cover-up to hide her [Mr May’s] own failings.’ Accusations: Labour MP Chris Bryant called on Mrs May to share the report in full . Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘I am concerned that the Home Secretary has decided to redact part of the findings related to the “Lille Loophole”... The committee has been assured in the past that the loophole would be closed. ‘The withholding of information prevents us from properly holding the Border Force to account.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was ‘extremely concerning’ that the report had been ‘censored’. One passage in the report states: ‘It was clear from our focus groups and interviews that staff and managers felt that resources in Calais were stretched at times.’ The preceding four paragraphs and the subsequent two were redacted. On the Lille Loophole, Mr Vine wrote: ‘During our familiarisation visit in October 2012, managers confirmed that this was still a cause for concern regarding the security of the border.’ The whole of the following paragraph was redacted, as were several others in the section, including one containing numbers of illegals suspected of abusing the route. Such is the scale of the problem that Mr Vine called on ministers to build immigration detention facilities at St Pancras in central London. The report warned that the UK was facing a surge in the number of illegal immigrants seeking to enter the country through the channel ports. But thousands of illegals are not having their fingerprints taken. No prints have been taken from migrants at Calais since January 2010 and none at Coquelles – where the Channel Tunnel entrance is situated – since April 2011. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘In accordance with the UK Borders Act 2007 the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Independent Chief Inspector, is required to redact any material which, if published, would be prejudicial to the interests of national security. ‘These take the form of visible redactions in the report laid before Parliament.’","Hidden details include number of illegal immigrants arriving from Brussels on Eurostar trains using 'Lille loophole'

"By . Andrew Levy Education Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:15 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:13 EST, 9 August 2013 . The cap on university fees has actually had the effect of raising the average price for undergraduate courses, a leading education academic has warned. The maximum that universities can charge full-time degree students was controversially trebled to £9,000 last year. Since then there has been a stampede among all institutions – not just the very best – to impose this sum, or close to it. Competition: A professor at Southampton University says institutions are charging £9,000 to avoid looking like 'the cheap option' But according to Jurgen Enders, professor of higher education at Southampton University, this is purely being fuelled by fears they will look ‘cheap’. There are concerns among institutions that charging less could affect their status, putting off potential students from wanting to go there. ‘It’s very unlikely that we will get an easyJet university,’ Professor Enders added. Meanwhile the lack of a price ceiling on postgraduate courses could explain their comparatively modest price of £6,000 a year on average, he said. But if these were capped, universities might move towards the upper limit for the same reason as undergraduate courses. The Coalition government’s controversial decision to massively increase fees sparked violent student demonstrations in London after the policy was announced in 2010. At the time, ministers countered concerns by saying most universities would charge more than £6,000 only in ‘exceptional’ circumstances. However, even before the hike was introduced, most universities indicated they intended to charge the maximum for at least one course. Theory: The are fears that charging less for a course will affect its status and put off students . Official figures show six in ten now charge £9,000 on some courses. From 2014, this will increase to three-quarters, while more than a quarter of institutions will demand top-level fees for all degrees. Overall, annual fees will rise by about two per cent to an average £8,647 next year. Discounts and bursaries available to students from poor backgrounds will reduce course costs to £8,425. But most undergraduates from middle-class backgrounds will have to pay the full amount. Nick Barr, professor of public economics at the London School of Economics, said universities also felt able to charge high fees for degrees because undergraduates have access to loans. According to some estimates, many students under the new fees regime will leave university after a three-year course with debts of £50,000 or more once living costs are taken into account. Last week, a study found those who end up in jobs earning an average salary will repay the most under the loans scheme, because they will be exposed to more interest payments for longer. By contrast, high earners will pay them off quicker, while those earning less than £21,000 do not have to make any repayments. Women were found to end up with the heaviest financial burden because they are paid less than men on average. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: ‘The new system has encouraged institutions to compete for students on the quality of the student experience – not just on price. ‘We have ensured there is better information available for potential students than ever before so that there is the best possible fit between students and institutions.’","Concerns raised by Jurgen Enders, professor at Soutthampton University .

The minister in charge of immigration claimed yesterday that border officials are simply too busy to take the fingerprints of people who try to sneak into the UK illegally. Mark Harper was responding to one of the key criticisms in a damning report by chief inspector of borders and immigration John Vine. The Home Office was accused of an ‘immigration cover-up’ after 15 passages in the study into border controls in Calais were blacked out for security reasons. Admission: Immigration minister Mark Harper said border staff are too busy to check fingerprints . One of the sections which survived criticised border staff for failing to take fingerprints from all those caught trying to enter Britain from France. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Mr Harper acknowledged it was useful to take fingerprints before people are handed over to the French authorities, but claimed officers have to strike a balance with carrying out other tasks. ‘It would be useful but equally it consumes a large amount of time for our officers to do that when they could be using that time to carry out other tasks to secure the border and it’s a balance, and the decision that was taken in 2010 was to work very closely with our French colleagues for them to process people trying to enter the United Kingdom illegally,’ he said. ‘But as I’ve said we’ve accepted that it would be appropriate to review our approach and that review will be completed by the end of the year.’ Critcisms: The chief inspector of borders and immigration John Vine wrote a damning report on Britain's border controls . Responding to criticism over the redacted parts of the report, the minister said Home Secretary Theresa May uses her power to redact reports in the name of national security ‘sparingly’. ‘I think if you look at the history of the reports that the chief inspector’s produced I think it would be fair to say that a number of them have previously been very critical for example of the UK Border Agency, in some cases very critical,’ he said. ‘In those cases the Home Secretary has not used her powers to redact any of those reports.’ A spokesman for MigrationWatch, a group that campaigns for more controls on immigration, said: ‘Security concerns may have led to some of the redactions in the report but it is difficult to see this as the reason for all of them. ‘Transparency has to be the best policy, if only to show that the Home Office has nothing to hide.’ Report author Mr Vine criticised the fact that immigration officials were not fingerprinting people found trying to enter the UK illegally, while biometric data was being taken from legitimate passengers. ‘I was surprised to find it wasn’t being done - it had ceased to happen at Calais from the beginning of 2010,’ he said. ‘They have 100 per cent checking for legitimate passengers. It seems anomalous that people who are trying to enter the country illegally in this way, we have no record of their identity, nor do we take in their fingerprints.’ He refused to criticise Mrs May for redacting parts of his report. ‘The Home Secretary has power under the Borders Act section 50, subsection 3, to redact any part of my report on grounds of national security,’ he said. ‘What I concentrate on doing is producing a thorough evidence-based report to her, and then she will take advice on matters such as this. It’s entirely her prerogative to do that, and in this case she’s chosen to exercise that prerogative.’","Mark Harper MP responding to damning report on border controls .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:57 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:46 EST, 9 August 2013 . Britain’s big six energy companies have enjoyed a £3.3billion windfall in profits since the election - while consumers’ bills have soared by £300 a year. Labour said the figures show that David Cameron has not done enough to crack down on profiteering by gas and electric firms. Since 2009, Britain’s Big Six energy companies (British Gas, E.ON, EDF, npower, Scottish Power and SSE) have been required to report to regulator Ofgem on their annual profits for generating and selling power. Big business: Britain's six biggest energy companies have enjoyed profits of £3.3billion since the election . Between them, they supply 98 per cent of households in Britain. Labour’s new research shows that the total profits (earnings before interest and taxation) of the Big Six energy companies increased from £2.158billion in 2009 to £2.219billion in 2010, £3.867billion in 2011, and £3.737billion in 2012. This represents a total windfall in profits of over £3.3billion since 2010. According to Ofgem’s latest Electricity and Gas Supply Market Indicators, the typical domestic dual fuel bill now stands at £1,420 a year, compared to £1,105 in May 2010 when David Cameron became Prime Minister. Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘With warnings of more price rises this winter, it’s clearer than ever that Britain needs to break the dominance of the energy giants and protect the public from being ripped off.’ The party plans to abolish Ofgem and create a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall. The party would also require the energy companies to pool the power they generate and to make it available to any retailer, to open up the market and make it more transparent. The firms would also be banned from offering unfair contracts and rolling small businesses over on to more expensive tariffs without their consent. Under fire: Labour minister Caroline Flint says the figures show the coalition has not done enough to crack down on profiteering energy companies . Small businesses would only be able to be back-billed for one year, and not subjected to six years of crippling back-billing, which at the moment can run into tens of thousands of pounds. And energy suppliers would have to take into account small businesses’ ability to pay any debt, and come up with a realistic and reasonable repayment plan, and not demand full payment immediately. Miss Flint said: ‘The public have been left with a £3.3billion price tag for David Cameron’s failure to act on rip-off energy bills. ‘He’s totally out of touch with millions of people and small businesses who are struggling with soaring energy bills. His failure to reform Britain’s broken energy market is leaving hard-pressed bill-payers massively out of pocket.’ Earlier this week, Labour published research revealing the full scale of the cost of living crisis facing Britain’s families under David Cameron. It found that working people are today an average of £1,350 worse off a year since the Coalition took over - and official forecasts show that over the course of this Parliament, that figure will reach £6,660. Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ‘This is a disappointing and inaccurate bashing of an industry which brings heat and light to 27million homes and business, pays billions each year to the Exchequer and creates employment for over 600,000 people. ‘If a company is to stay in business it has to make a profit. And the more a company has to invest then it has to make more profit to do so. ‘What is actually needed is a clear, sensible and coherent debate on what people want, how much wind power and how much gas, nuclear and coal is needed, what capacity is required and, critically, how much people are prepared to pay for it all. Petty point scoring has no place in the adult discussion and decision making required.’","British Gas, E.ON, EDF, npower, Scottish Power and SSE profit since 2010 .

Payouts from them are to be capped for three years under plans to clamp down on 'Wild West' betting practices . Slot machines dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of the  gambling world are to have their payouts capped for three years under plans to clamp down on ‘Wild West’ betting practices. The Mail has learned that a government review will  conclude that until at least 2016 bookmakers cannot put up the stakes or the prizes on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), where punters can place bets of  up to £100 a turn. High street bookies have also been told to draw up a code of  conduct for the casino-style machines which will allow customers to set a limit on how much they are prepared to lose. The machines, which feature games such as roulette, blackjack and poker and have a maximum payout of £500 – have been blamed for a spate of problem gambling as it is possible to lose hundreds of pounds in just a few minutes. They have become so popular that the profits from the machines now account for around half of all income for high street bookmakers. Under the plans, customers will be able to set their limit when they start betting and receive running updates about how much they have lost in order to discourage them from losing money that they cannot afford. At the same time, Culture Secretary Maria Miller will also bring forward plans to crack down on the world of online betting. Legislation will be introduced when MPs return to Westminster next month to ensure that every gambling website which has UK customers has to have a British betting licence. Thanks to rules introduced  by Labour, online gambling is lightly regulated, and high street firms such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral run their websites offshore, leaving them immune from control. Government officials say that requiring all online operators which work or advertise in the UK to have a British licence will ensure they participate in tackling corruption in sports, provide funding to combat problem gambling and ensure adequate protection of children and vulnerable adults. High street presence: But thanks to rules introduced by Labour, online gambling is lightly regulated, with firms such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral running their websites offshore . The Treasury is also set to introduce rules at a later date to ensure that online gambling operators are forced to pay tax on their activities in the UK. Government officials claimed that Mrs Miller had been privately lobbied by gambling companies to increase the number of FOBTs in their premises and the prizes they pay out. A senior source said: ‘Last year companies said they wanted more fixed odds terminals, and when they realised that wasn’t going to happen they said they wanted higher stakes and prizes.  They say these terminals are vital for their revenues. There’s been a lot of lobbying.’ Plans: Maria Miller is to bring forward a proposed crack down on the world of online betting . However, the Association of British Bookmakers, which represents high street firms, insisted that it had not made a formal demand for higher payouts for the FOBTs, classified as B2 machines. Spokesman Dirk Vennix said: ‘The ABB has never called for an increase in stakes and prizes on B2 gaming machines, and we believe they should remain as they are now.’ He added: ‘The ABB is launching a new code for responsible gambling and player protection in  betting shops, which will be published soon.’ Mrs Miller has not commented on the results of the review of stakes and prizes since it is not due to be published until next month. But the Culture Secretary said that she was bringing forward the legislation to control offshore  gambling websites to coincide with the review. She said: ‘Online gambling companies that operate in Britain and can affect families up and down our country must not remain outside British law. ‘Consumers need to know that this is not the Wild West and rules for gambling apply equally across the board. ‘We will ensure that through our licensing reforms, our online gambling companies take the responsibility they need to, including providing funding to help combat the problem-gambling which can blight lives. ‘There is no reason at all why online gambling taking place in this country should be able to operate outside UK law.’","Machines' profit now account for half of all income for high street bookies .

The BBC suppressed an independent review of its executive pay which found its top brass were paid up to three times more than their public sector counterparts. Despite being warned four years ago that the pay of the director general and his lieutenants far outstripped what they might earn in equivalent jobs in the civil service, corporation bosses failed to take immediate action to curb top-level pay. A study by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for the BBC Trust in 2009 found their basic salaries were instead on a par with the chiefs of aggressively profit-making FTSE 100 companies, despite the fact they are paid with licence fee payers’ money. No action: Despite warnings, Corporation bosses failed to take action to curb top salaries . Instead of risking embarrassment by publishing it in full, BBC bosses kept the report under wraps until it was released under Freedom of Information laws. Last night, MPs condemned the BBC for failing to publish the explosive findings earlier and said it illustrated a ‘fill your boots at public expense’ culture at the top of the corporation. Laying bare the true extent of BBC largesse, the newly released documents reveal: . Last night Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who sits on the influential public accounts committee of MPs, said executives would be asked to explain why the report was suppressed at its next hearing in September. The PwC report was commissioned by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons in April 2009 in response to widespread dismay at senior staff bonuses that year. Instead of publishing the report, the BBC’s executive remuneration committee – including Mr Thompson – discussed its findings in private and never published it in full. Review: The PwC report was commissioned by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons in April 2009 . At a meeting in July 2009, the committee decided BBC pay should be aligned with executives in the commercial public sector meaning the BBC could justify paying its executives far higher salaries. Yesterday a BBC spokesman justified the decision to benchmark its pay against the commercial public sector by saying the corporation needed to compete for talent with commercial media rivals. But Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who also sits on the public accounts committee, said: ‘There seems to have been a culture under the previous director general of “fill your boots at public expense and the expense of the licence fee payer”. The gravy train has finally hit the buffers. Those responsible must be held fully accountable for it.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘A great deal has been done since 2009 to address issues around executive remuneration at the BBC. ‘Following this review, the senior management paybill has been reduced by more than 30 per cent, the director general’s salary has come down almost 33 per cent, while the ratio of director-general’s salary to median pay has fallen from 16.8 to 11 and bonuses have been permanently withdrawn from executive directors.’","The BBC Trust commissioned a study of basic salaries back in 2009 .

The BBC’s executive remuneration committee was warned former director general Mark Thompson’s £651,000 basic salary was more than three times what he would be able to earn in an equivalent role in the civil service, Army or judiciary.
The corporation’s top ten earners, including former deputy director general Mark Byford on £609,000 and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson on £430,000, were paid on average more than twice their public sector counterparts. On average, basic salaries were only 4 per cent lower than the private sector.
The BBC’s executive remuneration committee decided to use high-paying ‘commercial public sector’ institutions – such as Network Rail or the Tote – as a benchmark for pay rather than more frugal ‘core’ public sector examples, such as the civil service. Minutes show they realised the decision was ‘likely to be contentious’.
Similar reviews have been carried out every year since 2009. They show executive salaries still exceed the agreed benchmark, but the BBC has redacted the documents to prevent the public from knowing by how much."

Not for sale: The Co-op will stop selling Nuts magazine after its publishers refused an ultimatum to use 'modesty bags' Co-op stores will no longer sell ‘lads mag’ Nuts after the title rejected an ultimatum to use 'modesty bags' or be removed from shelves. Nuts publisher IPC Inspire has announced that it will not use the bags, describing the ultimatum as 'an unreasonable attempt to prevent shoppers from freely browsing a legal magazine that is already displayed according to Home Office guidelines'. A spokeswoman for the Co-operative said: 'Our position has not changed. If Nuts and Zoo, or any of the other publications, Loaded and Front, do not put their titles into modesty bags by the date we’ve given of September 9, we will no longer sell the magazines.' IPC Inspire managing director Paul Williams said: 'The Co-operative’s knee-jerk attempt to restrict access to a product that consumers have enjoyed for nearly a decade is wrong. 'Nuts takes its obligation to craft products that are right for consumers and retailers alike very seriously and for a number of weeks now we have had new covers in place, which have a more conservative tone. 'We are delighted with our readers’ response to the new covers and last week’s issue was our biggest-selling since February. 'The objection that niche lobby groups have against certain sectors of the media should not mean that the right to purchase a perfectly legal product is restricted for the over half a million Nuts readers. 'As has been widely reported in the media in recent weeks, this is no longer a question of whether or not you like men’s magazines, it is a question of how far you can restrict the public’s ability to consume free and legal media before it becomes censorship.' The Co-operative, which describes itself as one of the UK’s largest magazine sellers, introduced opaque screens on shelves last month to shield children from 'lewd pictures' on front covers. It comes amid increasing debate about the effects of sexual images on children, with David Cameron recently setting out a raft of reforms which will introduce family-friendly filters that automatically block internet porn unless customers choose to opt out. Following the Co-operative’s announcement, Tesco said it would sell lads’ magazines only to over-18s.

If you have ever bumped your head on a low beam or door frame, you will know it's not much fun. So spare a thought for poor old fisherman, 6ft 3ins Robert Jones, for whom - as the last occupant Britain's Smallest House - it must have been an almost daily occurrence. The big man in the tiny house had just two cramped rooms in which he could stretch out his weary limbs after returning home from sea. But now thousands of tourists from all . around the world cram inside the pretty 122-inch tall building (10ft) every year to catch a glimpse of the 16th century treasure. Squash: Britain's smallest house has proved to be a big hit with tourists, according to tour guide Anne Fletcher . Located on the west coast of Wales in the sleepy fishing village of Conwg, it can only fit four people at a time and is just 6ft wide. According to the five members of staff who now offer tours, during peak season dozens of excited visitors from as far afield as America, Japan and Australia line up to get a glimpse of this quirky dwelling. Local tour guide Anne Fletcher, 58, . dons traditional Welsh dress to give visitors an authentic experience, . and explained why the pint-sized home is a mecca for mini-home spotters . the world over. She said: 'Thousands of people come to the Smallest House in Great Britain each year. That means we get hundreds of people every week during the height of summer. Move over: With only two rooms, there was not much space for a strapping fisherman Robert Jones . Fisherman: Robert Jones spent his days at sea and his nights in this home which now attracts thousands of tourists from across the globe . 'I think people are attracted to the novelty of being in such a small space in the knowledge that at one time this was someone’s entire home.

The Smallest House in Great Britain is so small it has been officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the UK’s tiniest house. It was occupied for more than 200-years until Jones finally moved out in 1900. According to Ms Fletcher, neighbouring houses, which were also tiny, were destroyed by the authorities and there were attempts in the past to demolish the building. However, local people stood up against town planners and eventually raised enough money to turn Jones's house into the much-loved tourist attraction it is today. 'This house is a great way to show present-day people how we once lived,' added Ms Fletcher. 'There is a little living room with historical pictures and items. And stairs lead up to the six-foot by eight-foot bedroom. 'All the cooking, washing and toilet activities would have been performed outside. For many people this house is a total eye-opener.'

If you are planning on taking part in any high risk activities today, it might be worth thinking again. Today is one of the most dangerous days of the year to go to Accident and Emergency. The first Wednesday of August is known as ‘Black Wednesday’ because it is the day that new junior doctors start work, and others move to different departments. The first Wednesday of August is known as 'Black Wednesday' because it is the day that new junior doctors start work, and others move to different departments . It is thought that people who are admitted to hospital as an emergency on ‘Black Wednesday’ are six per cent more likely to die than they would have been if they were admitted the previous Wednesday, The Telegraph reports. The situation is even worse for people who are having heart attacks or strokes – they are eight per cent more likely to die on ‘Black Wednesday’. In an attempt to reduce the problems caused by the influx of new doctors, the NHS has introduced a ‘shadowing’ scheme which sees junior doctors working with a senior doctor during their first four days on the job. Trials have suggested that this scheme reduces the number of mistakes made by junior doctors by about 50 per cent. Dr Jim Rodger, Head of Professional Services at the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland, told The Telegraph: ‘It is a difficult transition from medical student to junior doctor. Those graduates starting their working life this week should be aware that their competence and skills may not be complete. ‘They should understand their own limitations and seek help and advice from senior staff.’ People who are admitted to hospital as an emergency on 'Black Wednesday' are six per cent more likely to die than they would have been the previous Wednesday . It is thought that ‘Black Wednesday’ is particularly dangerous because it falls at a time when many of the more senior doctors are on their summer holidays. As a result, The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, has urged the NHS to make shifts ‘more flexibly and intelligently designed’ to ensure that there are more senior doctors in hospitals at this time of year. A Department of Health spokesman told The Telegraph: ‘This year's new medical graduates, who are about to start the Foundation Year 1 training, will be paid to shadow the Foundation Year 1 doctor whose post they will take over, as part of this national, mandatory scheme.’","Today is one of the most dangerous days of the year to go to an Accident and Emergency Department .

Security Guard David Glass has been jailed for 15 months for stealing £49,600 from armoured Loomis trucks . A security guard funded a lavish lifestyle with almost £50,000 stolen from 50 cash machines he was supposed to be refilling. Former soldier David Glass, 33, took the cash from the armoured trucks he drove to supply bank cash points while working for security company Loomis. Hull Crown Court heard that Glass . had taken £49,600 in cash while delivering notes to ATM machines . between October and December last year, and that he had been the driver for note . delivery of 50 ATM deliveries where money had gone missing. But he was not suspected until he . resigned on December 15 after being questioned over a missing . £1,180 taken from a delivery of cash for Hollywood Bowl, in Kingswood, . Hull. When police raided his home they found new iPads, iPhones, blue-ray player £3,279 in cash and invoices for the purchase of a car and jewellery. Crown barrister Nigel Clive said Glass was the driver of a van taking £23,000 to the Hollywood Bowl on November 10 last year. But because of technical glitch the alley could not accept the money, it was said, and it was trusted to Mr Glass to return the money to the parent company. However, when it was counted again there was £1,180 missing. Mr Clive said Glass’ resignation triggered an internal investigation at Loomis, and Glass was linked to missing cash from 50 ATM deliveries - all of which he was the driver. 'When police went to his home they found £3,279 in cash, large amounts of high-value goods including: iPods, iPads, a blue-ray player and invoices for purchases of a car and jewellery,' said Mr Clive. 'It was apparent all the money had been spent on his family’s lavish lifestyle. But he was not suspected until he resigned on December 15 after being questioned over a missing £1,180 taken from a delivery of cash for Hollywood Bowl, in Kingswood, Hull . 'Money had initially been paid into his wife’s account and that of his sister-in-law’s account and returned to him after a short period of time. The aim was to give a provenance of income from other family members.' Glass of Patrington, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft. His wife Verity Glass, 30, pleaded guilty to possession of £14,000 in criminal property. Mr Glass’s sister-in-law Bethany Sizer, 22, of Burstwick, pleaded guilty to transferring £5,500 in criminal property. Defending all three, barrister Harold Bloomfield said Mrs Sizer had played the lesser role. 'She accepts she behaved naively,' said Mr Bloomfield. 'It was a single transaction. She was with her sister when the money was paid into the bank. She accepts her wrong doing. She was not aware her brother-in-law was stealing to such a large extent. 'She is pregnant and due to give birth on September 3. I urge you to follow the pre-sentence report.' Judge Simon Jack told Sizer he accepts she was on the edge of the theft and she would have a criminal record and gave her a 12-month conditional discharge. Mr Glass’s sister-in-law Bethany Sizer, 22, of Burstwick, (left) pleaded guilty to transferring £5,500 in criminal property.  His wife Verity Glass, 30, (right) pleaded guilty to possession of £14,000 in criminal property . Mr Bloomfield told the court: 'Mr Glass is entitled to maximum credit. He resigned from Loomis, bringing to an end, two-months of dishonesty. It was only after he left, that enquiries took place. He accepts the heat would have been on him. 'He was in the Royal Logistics Corp serving in Kosovo in 1986 where he witnessed unfortunate events. This has made his personality more fragile. After leaving the Army where he had a position of responsibility he found it difficult to cope with the loss of status. It did not stand him in good stead for Civvie Street. He was having problems at home at the time. He recognised from day one custody was inevitable.' He said Mrs Glass was swept along with money coming into the house and because of her relationship difficulties did not feel able to question where it was coming from. Sentencing Judge Simon Jack told Glass: 'You have served your country in the past and had unfortunate experiences in the Army. That does not excuse what you did at Loomis. This was theft on a substantial scale. A total of £50,000 was taken in 10 weeks. This is large-scale theft. The money seems to have gone on extravagant spending. There was no reason for you to take that money. There has to be a custodial sentence. The public would expect no less for the level of theft you have committed.' He jailed Glass for 15 months and imposed a 12-month community order on his wife who left the court in tears. They will both face an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover any money they have left. There will be a POCA hearing in October.","Former soldier David Glass, 33, took cash from armoured trucks he drove .

More than 30 moms gathered together to breastfeed their babies as part of a ‘Nurse In’ protest in front of the American Airlines ticketing counter at Baltimore–Washington International Airport on Wednesday morning. The protest was in reaction to the airline’s treatment of a mom on a flight last month when she ‘harassed’ for breastfeeding her five-month-old child. While that woman wishes to remain anonymous, her friend Hannah Butta has taken up the cause and organized Wednesday’s protest. 'Nurse-In': More than 30 moms gathered together to breastfeed their babies at Baltimore-Washington International Airport on Wednesday morning . ‘When American Airlines asked our friend to cover up while she was breast feeding we knew that legally she was already given that right,’ Butta told ABC7, while breastfeeding her son. ‘We just had to stand up for it because we knew it was wrong,’ She, along with the other mothers, came together in support of their friend because they are very disappointed with how American Airlines has handled the situation. The unnamed woman, a resident of Laurel, Maryland, was on a flight home from Los Angeles when her five month old became cranky and hungry. Wednesday's protest was organized by Hannah Butta, who identified herself as a 'dear friend' of the mom on the flight . She says she turned in her window seat and started to breast feed her child while her husband added extra protection in the middle seat. The problem started, she says, when a flight attendant asked her to cover her child with a blanket to not make any other passengers uncomfortable. They declined and felt that from that point on the attendant ‘avoided looking at us’ and didn’t offer them any drinks. The woman wrote the airline to voice her concerns that the flight attendant displayed ‘inappropriate, harassment-style behavior.’ She received a reply in which the airline said that breast-feeding is allowed in flight, but ‘because of the offense that may be taken by others within the close confines of commercial aircraft, we simply ask that breast-feeding be done with a certain discretion and a sense of modesty.’ American Airlines wrote to the mom and offered her a free travel voucher, but she says she just wanted to raise awareness and receive an apology . This contradicts the airline’s own manual which states: ‘Breast-feeding of infants is permitted during all phases of flight, F/As should not place restrictions or requirements on the mother of the infant.’ ‘We believe it is reasonable that we ask the mother to cover up in an appropriate manner during the feeding and by your account it appears that you were sensitive to this need.’ Butta, who identified herself as a 'dear friend' of the mom on the flight, posted the airline’s letter on Facebook and it has been shared more than 7,5000. The American Airlines Facebook page has been inundated with comments from breastfeeding mothers around the world and the company has since apologized to the mom for her treatment by the ‘well-intentioned’ flight attendant. The woman was also offering a free travel voucher, but says she wanted to do was raise awareness and receive an apology. The letter the mom received from American Airlines was posted by Hannah Butta on Facebook and has been shared more than 7,500 times since Sunday .","The protest was in support of a mom told to cover up while she breastfeed on a American Airlines flight last month .

All age groups of younger men have overtaken women in the spending stakes, according to market researchers Mintel. However, men over 45 still show little interest in digging deep in their pockets for fashionable shoes, making do with old pairs they already own. When it comes to quantity over quality though, women are still leading the way. They buy four more pairs a year on average but they will be cheaper pumps and flats, while men invest in a few choice pairs of high-quality work shoes and designer trainers. Leading the way for number of shoes bought every year are women in the north-west of England. Across Britain we now spend £8.7billion on footwear a year, up 5 per cent on last year. Men in the north-west and in London are the most concerned with buying their favourite brands, willing to spend even more for a pair of shoes they covet.

British tourists who booked a weekend 'mini-cruise' to Amsterdam spent just six minutes in the Dutch capital after their overnight ferry crossing turned into a 30-hour journey from hell. More than 300 people booked the £48-a-head break to the Netherlands, which should have entailed them arriving in Holland at 9am last Saturday and spending all day in Amsterdam before boarding an 11pm boat home. But after they boarded the DFDS Princess Seaways service from North Shields on Friday afternoon, their boat was lashed by such high winds and rough seas that their arrival at the Dutch port of Ijmuiden was delayed by 13 hours. Passengers on the DFDS Princess Seaways endured a nightmare journey to Holland as the ship was battered by high winds and rough seas . Instead of arriving at 9am on Saturday, the weary - not to mention nauseous - passengers did not reach land til 10pm. They then had to board a coach to take them to the Hook of Holland so they could take an alternative Stena Line Hollandica ferry route back to the UK. Mark Dunn, 25, from North Shields, went on the cruise with ten of his friends and said they spent a total of 45 hours travelling and just six minutes in Amsterdam. He said: 'There were about 350 round-trip passengers like us on the ferry. 'When we set off on Friday, it was blowing a gale, and then an hour into the journey, I think it was about gale force eight or nine. 'We didn't get there until 11pm on Saturday night.  We spent about six minutes in the ferry terminal carpark in Amsterdam before they took us onto coaches. 'We thought we were going to see Holland, but they just drove us to the Hook of Holland and put us on a ferry to Harwich. The tourists had been looking forward to seeing the canals and shops of Amsterdam, pictured . 'We didn't even get a cabin. We just had to sit there.  Everything was out of control.' After arriving in Harwich at 10pm on Sunday, the passengers were taken by coach to North Shields, arriving at 4.30am on Monday morning. Amusement arcade manager Mark said: 'I wish I'd never bothered. I think I've done more miles than Judith Chalmers. 'The annoying thing is I don't think they the ferry should have left - they would have known about the weather. James O'Neill, 31, paid to fly home rather than go endure another nightmare crossing . Father-of-one James O'Neill, 31, who runs an electroplating business in Bedlington, Northumberland, said: 'It was horrendous - I still feel like I'm on a boat.  We should never have set off, people were being sick all over the place. 'I was on a stag do with a group of lads and ended up getting off on the Sunday morning and paying to fly home as I had an important meeting to get to on Monday. 'They've offered us another trip but I never want to get on a boat again.' Max Foster, DFDS Seaways UK passenger director, said: 'I would like to apologise to all passengers who were affected by our delayed mini cruise sailing on our Amsterdam route on Friday, March 22. 'The delay was caused by unpredicted severe adverse weather conditions on the North Sea, which resulted in the outbound crossing of Princess Seaways from Newcastle being delayed. 'Our primary focus at DFDS Seaways is always on passenger safety. Our crew and shore-based team worked hard to ensure our passengers were able to make their way home as quickly and safely as possible, whilst endeavouring to keep them informed of the situation throughout. 'As a result, our passengers disembarked on Sunday morning and were transported to the Hook of Holland to travel back to Harwich via another ferry service. 'They then continued by coach back to Newcastle. We have offered all passengers affected by the delayed sailing the opportunity to take their mini cruise at another time convenient to them.'","British tourists hoped to spend all day on Saturday in Dutch capital .

'Anyone and everyone can wear it.' For those not up to speed with Japanese . teen trends, Kawaii is all about looking hyper-cute, doll-like even, and . it's fast becoming popular here - both with teens and older women. But I'm not convinced. I'm at the Hyper Japan show in London's Earl's Court being transformed into a 'Kawaii' girl, which in my case, means lashings of glitter, a pink wig and a frilly dress of the sort Grayson Perry would be proud of. It's certainly not my usual look. Girly: Ruth in her pink wig - complete with detachable bunches - and a dress Grayson Perry would love . Frilly: Artist Grayson Perry is a big fan of flouncy Kawaii style dresses . The antithesis of fake-tanned hair-extensioned TOWIE chic, Kawaii girls like pink, kitsch, tutus, delicate dabs of glitter, enormous false lashes and ultra pale skin. The most common Kawaii style is named the 'classic Lolita', which despite referencing the Nabokov novel in the name, has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute, girlish and pretty as possible. Based on frilled and furbelowed Victorian styles combined with a hint of goth, girls hope to achieve a porcelain-doll look using lashings of lace, ribbon, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Then there's the 'Sweet Lolita' look. Featuring even more ribbons, bows, and lace, than the 'Classic Lolita', it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels. Fairy Kei is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets, teamed with lighter, less extreme make-up. Not surprisingly, the prettiness of Kawaii has won it legions of fans among British teens - many of whom have turned up at Hyper Japan, pretty in their lilac wigs and supersized falsies. At 28, I'm more than a decade older than most of them, and at 5ft 8"", considerably taller to boot. I don't wear pink and I certainly don't do wacky wigs. Nevertheless, Sandra, and her colleague Tamara, are confident that it won't take much to turn me into a fully fledged Kawaii girl. We kick off with make-up. Lots of make-up. As I'm going to be a Sweet Lolita, that means a fresh-looking pale base and lots of pink blusher. Then there's my eyes which get several washes of pink eyeshadow, black and white liner and a frosting of glitter. Then Tamara takes over to add false lashes so heavy, my eyes semi-close followed by tiny diamante hearts at the corners of my eyes and dotted along my lashline. But make-up alone just isn't enough, so I'm whisked away to be fitted up for a wig. The wig they choose is bright bubblegum pink and comes with detachable bunches. Like the falsies, it's heavy. Finally, we go hunting for a dress. The one Tamara eventually picks is - of course - bright pink and comes with a sash, a tutu and a frilly lace neckline. Am I done yet? Ruth checks out her thickly applied Kawaii make-up - complete with tiny heart gems . And pose! The writer gets into character with the help of a kawaii-inspired pouting selfie . Crazy: Without the wig, the Kawaii look is prettier, and according to Sandra, is great for evenings out . Fully dressed, I survey myself in a . mirror held up by Tamara and barely recognise myself. I look like a . cross between Grayson Perry and a toddler. It's fun but I'm not . convinced this is the look for me so I take it outside for a second . opinion. On the way out, I'm stopped by a . woman on her way into the show. 'I just love your look,' she smiles. 'I . think you're very brave.' Then I find a pair of workmen, who break into smirks as I approach. 'What do you think?' I ask, giving them a twirl. 'You look great, love,' says one smiling kindly at me. 'Speak for yourself!' sniggers his friend. Hmmm - not quite the reaction I was hoping for. Back inside, I meet pint-sized J-Pop duo, Yanakiku. Dressed in elaborate mini-kimonos teamed with clompy boots and twirling feathery fans, to my untrained eyes, the pair have a Kawaii-esque look themselves. As soon as I walk through the door, they're exclaiming about by enormous eyelashes. 'Your lashes are so cool!' they chorus. The real deal: J-Pop duo Yanakiku (left) and a proper Kawaii girl at Hyper Japan (right) They too are very cool, their diminutive frames proving the perfect foil for their quirky-cool look which, they tell me, isn't Kawaii but another style sub-set called 'kimono cosplay', which involves Anime cartoon inspired clothes made with kimono fabric. By now, my hairline is becoming itchy thanks to the wig, so I wave goodbye to Yana and Kiku and head back to Sandra and Tamara to hand back my Kawaii get-up. Relieved of my wig and dress, I instantly feel better, strolling round to see Hyper Japan's sushi stalls and geisha performances without feeling like a goth at a football match. So could I be a Kawaii girl? While I learned to love my pink blusher and eyeshadow and enjoyed pirouetting around in glitter galore, it's just too girly and I'm definitely too old. What looks sweet on a teenager looks babyish on me, so I'll be giving the frills and furbelows a miss along with the heavy, luridly coloured wigs. Madly creative and very, very pretty, Kawaii isn't great for the over-20s but looks gorgeous on girls. Kawaii, which translates as 'adorable', is a Japanese sub-culture which places emphasis on being as cute as possible. Although the best known aspect of Kawaii is the kitsch fashion, Kawaii girls and boys also apply the concept to the way they live and behave. While it looks similar to other Japanese cultural phenomena such as Hara Juku, Kawaii girls have a more doll-like appearance, with big doe-eyes, pastel-coloured make-up and colourful hair. Kawaii fashion is based on Victorian fashion, with wearers intent on looking cute, innocent and pretty courtesy of lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles and aprons. The most common form of Kawaii is the Classic Lolita, which has subsets, including the Sweet Lolita, which has even more ribbons, bows, and lace, and Fairy Kei, which often includes giant bow headdresses or bonnets. Because Kawaii is a lifestyle rather than a purely fashion phenomenon, certain behaviour such as high pitched voices and girly giggles are expected of those who embrace it. In the UK, the majority of Kawaii girls are teens, although in Japan, many are much older. A study by cosmetic company Kanebo found that women in their 20s and 30s actively attempt to achieve the cute look, which is considered the beauty ideal by both men and women in Japan.","Kawaii is a Japanese teen trend that focuses on being as cute as possible .

Police could be forced drastically to scale back their use of ‘Big Brother’ road cameras which record the movements of millions of motorists every day. In a landmark ruling, the privacy watchdog declared that a ring of cameras installed around the quiet market town of Royston in Hertfordshire was unlawful and excessive. Privacy campaigners said yesterday’s ruling would affect every police force in the country and would make them carry out a full audit of the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system, a network of 10,000 cameras across the UK. Every day, these record the detailed movements of some 16million motorists. The cameras record the number plate of every vehicle that passes. Facing the axe: The number of ANPR cameras that monitor the movements of millions of motorists could be cut back after a ruling that deemed them unlawful and excessive . Police say they allow officers to track criminals in real time as they drive around. But critics say the cameras amount to an ‘automated checkpoint system’. In Royston, police installed seven cameras in 2010 at a cost of £45,000. Cameras operating 24 hours a day on every major road made it impossible for residents to enter or leave the town without their number plates registering on the system. Details of their movements are collected and stored on a giant database, in effect giving police a full record of all significant car journeys by the town’s 16,000 residents. But residents campaigned for the cameras to be removed, and privacy groups complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office. The watchdog ruled that the blanket use of the cameras was excessive and unlawful because it breached the Data Protection Act. Hertfordshire Constabulary was given 90 days to reduce its use of the cameras. In his judgment, Information Commissioner Christopher Graham condemned the police force for failing to justify the extent of the surveillance. He said the chief constable had given ‘no satisfactory explanation for his policy of covering the road network’. Hertfordshire Constabulary had not properly assessed the impact of the cameras on either privacy or crime, the watchdog said. In its ruling – the first time a police force has been ordered to decrease the level of ANPR use – the watchdog warned that the data could be used for ‘purposes other than those originally intended’ and that there was a risk that it could be unlawfully accessed or released. Nick Pickles, director of the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘This sends a clear message that the blanket logging of vehicle movements is not going to be within the law. ‘Every police force in the country is affected by this ruling and must now undertake a comprehensive assessment of their own systems to ensure they are not excessive. ‘The Information Commissioner must now take steps to ensure motorists are not being routinely tracked, wherever they live.’ Residents in Royston, which is on the border of Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, welcomed the ruling. Grandmother Jane Katsikas, 45, a carer, said: ‘What happened to privacy? People should be able to go about their lives without being filmed or photographed every second. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham, left, condemned Hertfordshire police for failing to justify the extent of surveillance while Nick Pickles said every police force in the country would be affected by the ruling . ‘This is supposed to be a free country. It is just Big Brother gone mad and I’m appalled.’ Last night Hertfordshire Constabulary said it intended to carry on using the cameras – and was developing a ‘privacy impact assessment’ to justify their use. A spokesman said: ‘The Constabulary intends to continue using ANPR cameras, which deliver very substantial policing benefits, but also to ensure that its particular deployment of such cameras is – and is seen to be – fully justified.’","Landmark ruling declares ring of cameras around Royston, Herts, was unlawful and excessive .

Live Aid founder Sir Bob Geldof is caught up in a row with his neighbour over plans for a garden gate linked to his 900-year-old country estate. Deborah Reynolds wants to reinstate an old opening in the wall of the former rockstar's mansion in Kent, but Sir Bob says it is a security risk. Ms Reynolds, 43, says the gate will give her better access to the garden of her Grade II-listed, end-terrace house which stands right next to Sir Bob's land. But the ex-pop star is opposing her planning application and says putting a gate in his wall would allow people easy access to his home. Row: Sir Bob Geldof wants to stop his neighbour opening up an old gate (circled) linked to his property's wall so she can get better access to her garden . In his letter of objection, Sir Bob, 61, wrote: ''I oppose this application because permission will not be given to the applicant to undertake these changes to my property. 'In addition, I will not allow any right of way over my land between the gateway and the rear garden. 'I further object on grounds of loss of amenity. To open a 'gate' at this point in the boundary wall of my property will be a tangible security risk to it. 'During the three decades I have occupied the house it was only by reluctantly creating a fenced boundary onto Dark Hill and by growing hedges [...] that I have been able to finally stop repeated encroachments onto my grounds.' Argument: Sir Bob says he would not allow any right of way over his land at Davington priory in Kent,  and argues that it will be unsecured if allowed . Ms Reynolds, 43, wants to put the opening in an area where a gate previously existed before it was bricked over in the 1930s. She said: 'The land is not shared - it is my land. 'I am proposing to re-instate a side access gate adjacent to my property to enable myself to have side access.' Ms Reynolds' cottage was once part of the Davington Priory estate where Sir Bob has lived for 30 years. Aerial view: Sir Bob's house is in red at the top of the picture and the gate would be in the circled area at the bottom . Villagers said they supported their famous neighbour's opposition to the gate. Jaqueline Hitchcock, 86, said: 'In the past people have jumped over the wall into Bob's grounds. 'If there is a gate directly into his land then there certainly would be a security risk for him. 'There is no need to put the gate in. I cannot understand why there is a problem with access to the cottage.' Retired publican Terence Boulton, 66, said 'Bob isn't usually up himself or anything like that. 'He's very approachable and doesn't act like a superstar. He talks to people and is often seen walking around the town.'

Britain's 'obsession' with wind farms will push up family electricity bills by more than £300 a year, a report claimed today. The Government's green energy plans for the next eight years are a £124billion 'blunder' that will hit every UK household, a senior British economist has also said. In a stark warning Professor Gordon Hughes, who has produced a study on how wind energy will hit energy costs, said that British consumers simply cannot afford to subsidise wind power. False economy? Wind power will add £300 to the average annual electricityl bill, a report claimed today . Prof Hughes is one of the UK's leading . energy economists and works at the prestigious University of Edinburgh. He was also a senior adviser on energy and environmental policy at the . World Bank. By 2020 average electricity bills will be around 58 per cent higher - a £320 increase - just because of the flood of wind turbines planned for Britains's coastlines, fields and seas, he said. Completing the gloomy picture, Professor Hughes believes for all the huge investment in wind farms Britain's greenhouse gas emissions may not even fall. Wind energy provides almost 2 per cent . of global electricity worldwide, a figure expected to approach 10 per . cent by 2020, costing Britain an estimated £124 billion. 'The key problems with current policies for wind power are simple,' he said. Supply: The Government wants to move away from traditional ways of generating energy to reduce greenhouse emissions . 'They require a huge commitment of investment to a technology that is not very green, in the sense of saving a lot of CO2, but which is certainly very expensive and inflexible. Critic: Energy expert Professor Ian Fells says that wind power will be the next big 'political problem' as it is just too expensive . 'Unless the current Government scales back its commitment to wind power very substantially, its policy will be worse than a mistake, it will be a blunder. 'The average household electricity bill would increase from £528 per year at 2010 prices to a range from £730 to £840 in 2020.' The report has been published by former Chancellor Lord Lawson's Global Warming Policy Foundation. Their study has been handed to the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change study for the Economics of Wind Power Committee. Meanwhile, Professor Ian Fells, who is Professor of Energy Conversion at Newcastle University and an advisor the Commons and Lords, also said that windfarms are too costly. Instead he claims that combined gas cycle plants could produce the same amount of green energy for £13billion – nearly 10 times cheaper than wind power. 'Wind energy is the most expensive way of generating renewable electricity,' he said. 'It will also cost jobs. We are already seeing some industrial firms packing up and moving abroad. The increasing price of energy is going to be the next big political problem.' Chart: Wholesale electric gas prices from 2007 until July 2012 show the huge difference in price the big six firms buy and sell to consumers at . Increase: Many more farms like these ones off Whitstable and Herne Bay in Kent will be created and the Government insists this is the right way to go . However, the Government was keen today to defend its green energy policies. 'Wind power is a homegrown, secure and sustainable source of energy with an important role as part of a balanced energy mix,' a spokesman said. 'Over-reliance on any one technology could have serious consequences for consumer bills. That’s why we want to see a diverse energy mix with renewables, nuclear, clean coal and gas all playing a part.'","Report to be handed to Government says that electricity prices for average home will go up 58% by 2020 because of turbines .

Mega-basement: Christian Candy, pictured with wife Emily, wants to build a leisure centre underneath his Thames-side mansion . A property tycoon has submitted plans to build a bowling alley, cinema and private spa under a two century old mansion owned by the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Property developer Christian Candy wants to build the extravagant complex under the Thames-side Gordon House, which was once nurses' quarters at the hospital, home to the Chelsea pensioners. The 29-year-old businessman, who has an estimated £150 million fortune, bought a long lease on the property from The Royal Hospital for a reported £75 million last year - the first time the house was offered on the market since it was built in 1809. He submitted plans submitted to Kensington and Chelsea council last week. They detail a sprawling underground space, including a swimming pool, with a cold plunge pool and jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. The plans also show a dance studio, treatment rooms, a cinema and an 18-metre two-lane bowling alley, the Evening Standard reports. It is believed, if approved, the plans would make it one of London's largest home basements at 1,200 square metres. The redevelopment plans for the property include three historic buildings - the house, an Orangery, and a smaller building, Creek Lodge - underneath which would be the basement and a new two storey modern annexe above it. Kensington and Chelsea Council has said it will limit the size and depth of basements from the end of the year. Proposal: Mr Candy wants to built the extravagant expansion under neath the two century old Gordon House in Chelsea . However, because Gordon House sits in . two acre grounds, architects Paul Davis &Partners are able to design . a much larger subterranean living area than has previously been . possible. It is . believed that because they are going under the garden rather than the . building, or surrounding streets, they have been allowed freer rein. Savills agents handled the original sale. Jonathan Hewlett, head of London residential at the agents, told the paper that this had 'given them scope to accommodate everything they could possibly want.' 'The best basements are not the ones that go down 25 floors they’re are the ones that offer fantastic space and total privacy.' The plans were originally drawn up by the Royal Hospital. Site plan: This graphic shows where Gordon House is situated and the location of the proposed annex . Plans for the subterranean 'lifestyle' place have been submitted to Kensington and Chelsea council . They have been amended by Mr Candy, who has said that he wants to return Gordon House 'to its historic use as a single-family residence.' Mr Candy was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline. But a spokesman for his company CPC Group told the Evening Standard that the revised application was a 'minor amendment to The Royal Hospital’s existing approved planning application.' Gordon House was designed by Thomas Leverton for Colonel James Willoughby Gordon. Upon his death in 1851, it became part of the Royal Hospital and was used as nurses quarters. The orangery was most recently used by the red-coated Chelsea pensioners as a library.","Christian Candy wants to build extravagant complex under Gordon House .

From mysterious disappearances to rape allegations and even murder, cruise ships are no stranger to crime. But until recently, operators have been reluctant to reveal details of incidents for fear that the revelations will damage their standing among travellers. Now three of the largest US-based cruise lines have come clean on crime at sea and released data that reveal the extent and nature of onboard incidents in full. Coming clean: Royal Caribbean is one of the three cruise lines to have released data on incidents onboard . While crime levels at sea remain low, the data released by Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line show that more onboard incidents have happened than previously believed. Although the US Coastguard, to whom serious crimes at sea are reported, has logged just 31 allegations since January 2011, figures released by Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line reveal a total of 114 alleged incidents since October 2010. Most of the complaints focused on allegations of rape and sexual assault, followed by thefts. ""We are doing this voluntarily to remove all doubt about the relatively low level of crime on cruise ships, especially when compared with comparable land-based crimes,"" Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell told CBS News. ""The majority of these are never substantiated as actual crimes after the initial investigation."" Crimes at sea are unusual, although there have been a spate of disappearances in recent years. Among them was John Halford, 63, who vanished during a Red Sea cruise in 2011 and Rebecca Coriam, 24, who went missing during a cruise from Mexico to Los Angeles the same year. Tragic: Rebecca Coriam was 24 when she disappeared while holidaying on a Disney cruise ship in March 2011 . Full disclosure: Carnival will reveal details of incidents in the hope that it will erase doubts about crime at sea . Although figures offered by Dr. Ross Klein of CruiseJunkie.com reveal that 200 people have vanished at sea since 2000, they represent a tiny fraction of the 1.7 million cruise passengers who embark each year. Nevertheless, bodies such as the International Cruise Victims group have long campaigned for greater transparency from the cruise industry over incidents at sea. Kendall Carver, chairman of the International Cruise Victims group, said: ""I think it's a step in the right direction. ""The question is, is it accurate or is it a public relations move? This is something they have resisted forever. ""If they really are serious, then they will support the new law [the USA recently implemented the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act] so that everybody does it on a consistent basis.""","Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line to release data .

The widow of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev has started acting more like her old self by watching movies, listening to rock music and reconnecting with her family, her relatives have said. Katherine Russell, 24, is living at her parents' home in Rhode Island with her daughter by Tsarnaev, and she is enjoying the activities once forbidden by her late husband. She has changed her name back to Katherine Russell from Karima Tsarnaeva, the name she adopted after marrying Tsarnaev, who was killed earlier this year following a police shootout. Moving on: Katherine Russell, 24, is pictured leaving her parents' home in North Kingston, Rhode Island, where relatives say she is becoming more like her old self by enjoying movies and music . 'We're seeing glimpses of the old Katie . again, and it's wonderful,' a relative told People magazine. 'We thought . she was gone forever.' Even though she is becoming more relaxed in certain aspects of her life - including using nail varnish and visiting fast food restaurants, according to some reports - she has stayed strict in others. 'She . has made it clear to her entire family that she is a Muslim and will . remain a Muslim,' the relative said. 'That's non-negotiable. The family respects that.' Earlier reports said that her parents, Warren and Judith, were hopeful she would revert to her Christian beliefs, but she has continued to wear her full Muslim dress when leaving the house. But they are relieved that she is on the path back to her old life after she was in the control of Tsarnaev for so many years, her friends said. 'She still wanted to hang out with her friends, . but he wasn't letting her,' Jesse Coyle, who used to date Russell's best friend, said of Tsarnaev. Old lice: Katherine Russell (left), the widow of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right), was reportedly under his control when he was alive and is now enjoying activities once forbidden by him . 'He made her get rid of her Facebook account, . and she always had to text him and let him know what she was doing. All . her friends told her to leave him, but she was hooked on him.' It had previously been reported that she drastically changed after meeting Tsarnaev while at a club during her college years. 'Katherine was completely sub­servient to him,' a source told the Enquirer. 'She cowered around him.' She is cooperating with officials in . the investigation, but claims she had no idea her husband was plotting . to bomb the Boston marathon as she was working 80 hours a week as a . health care aide. She has not been accused of any . wrongdoing, but the FBI have questioned her to find out if . she had any clue as to her husband's plans. New life: Russell, pictured wearing traditional Muslim attire, has continued to stick to her Muslim beliefs . Innocence: Her family said they are getting glimpses of what she used to be like when she was younger . The bombing at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev . and his brother Dzhokhar, originally from Chechnya, are believed to . have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs. Her lawyer Joshue Dratel, from New York, said that he joined Russell's legal team . to help her navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her . interests. He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep co-operating. 'I . don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,' he said. 'There's . no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.' She was widowed when Tamer­lan was killed in a police shootout on April 19 – four days after he and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly set off bombs during the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed in the cowardly attack and 264 more were wounded, sev­eral of whom lost limbs. Atrocity: The bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon last month killed three people and injured 260 . Dzhokhar, 19, has pleaded not guilty to 30 charges, including 17 that carry the death penalty. Before the bombings, Russell, . 24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her husband and . two-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North . Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed. Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it. Two U.S. officials have said that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband. One of her lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.","Katherine Russell 'is enjoying activities once forbidden by her husband'

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 08:19 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:39 EST, 7 August 2013 . Shocking new images today laid bare the scale of the devastation in Syria wrought by months of civil war, with neighbourhoods flattened by multiple bombing raids. The satellite photographs collected by Amnesty International reveal how parts of Aleppo, the country's largest city, were almost wiped out by missile strikes from government forces. The two-year civil war has seen the destruction of many of Aleppo's historic monuments, as well as six million Syrians being forced to flee their homes after being caught in the crossfire between the regime and rebel fighters. Scroll down for video . Devastation: The Aleppo neighbourhood of Jabal Babro was largely flattened by a government bombing raid on February 18 this year . Contrast: Tariq al-Bab was a densely populated area before it was targetted by a regime air strike on February 22 . A series of images compiled by Amnesty show how bomb attacks have spread through Aleppo between last September and May this year, with more and more of the city covered by the red dots which indicate areas of significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. While both sides have been accused of atrocities, the evidence in Aleppo suggests that rebel-held areas in the north and east of the city have received the brunt of the damage as the regime bombards those neighbourhoods with little concern for civilian casualties. An analysis by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in co-operation with Amnesty concluded that the scale of the destruction was 'severely lopsided', with opposition areas significantly worse affected than loyalist ones. Much of the regime's firepower has been focussed on Aleppo because it is the rebels' main stronghold and could severely weaken the opposition movement if the government wrests control. War: Ard al-Hamra was also hit by bombing on February 22, leading to vast swathes of the neighbourhood being totally laid waste . Irreplaceable: This image shows a satellite view of Aleppo's Great Mosque before and after its minaret was blown up during fighting in April . In total, half of the city's population has been displaced as a result of the fighting. Amnesty pointed to three areas in particular which were almost totally destroyed by government air strikes in mid-February. Satellite photographs of Jabal Badro, Tariq al-Bab and Ard al-Hamra show that whole blocks of houses have been wiped off the map. 160 residents of the area were killed in the raids, and hundreds more made homeless. In addition, historic monuments such as the minaret of the city's Great Mosque have been demolished, despite the international laws on protecting culturally significant sites. Start of conflict: During September last year, serious physical destruction - marked on this image with red dots - was confined to just a few areas . Development: Fighting in Aleppo raged fiercely, as this image from November indicates, with the regime desperate to evict rebels from their strongholds . 'Aleppo has been utterly devastated, its people fleeing the conflagration in huge numbers,' said Amnesty's Donatella Rivera, who has visited Syria more than 10 times over the past 16 months. 'The risk cited one year ago regarding the devastating consequences of turning what was Syria's most populous city into a battlefield has become reality. 'Aleppo has been utterly devastated, many of its residents fleeing the bombardments in huge numbers and many others trapped in a city under fire and under siege in desperate humanitarian conditions.' Despite repeated calls for both sides to respect internationally accepted rules of warfare, observers have noted serious war crimes on both sides, including the indiscriminate shelling of civilians and summary executions of prisoners of war. Relentless: Aleppo in February this year, when much of the north and east of the city had been hit by bombing raids . Latest: By May, few parts of the city had escaped being severely damaged, with the devastation especially prevalent in areas held by the opposition . Christoph Koettl of Amnesty International USA said: 'The grave violations of international law in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria are a direct consequence of the international community's paralysis and delay in effectively condemning these crimes, and referring the situation to the world's criminal court of last resort. 'The images are a snapshot of a population under brutal siege as Amnesty's researcher on the ground has revealed over time.' At least 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the civil war which originated in protests against the autocratic regime of president Bashar Assad. In addition, millions of refugees have been forced into tent cities within Syria and abroad as they seek to flee the fighting.","Images compiled by Amnesty International show how Aleppo has gone from a thriving city to a wasteland .

After being let in by the alleged thief’s mother, investigators made their way to his room. “I opened the door and observed Craig and what appeared to be a very young girl getting out of his bed,” Ashland police wrote in a police report quoted by the Boston Herald. “Both of them were completely naked and hurrying to put clothes on.’ After initially telling authorities she was 16 – the age of consent in Massachusetts – she revealed she was 14. Police notified the girl’s mother and sent her to a local hospital for an exam and ‘evidence collection,’ the Herald reported. The stolen items were found in the home’s garage, according to reports. No further details on the items were made available and Ashland police could not be reached by MailOnline for comment. Good was booked on two charges of aggravated rape, two counts of abuse of a child and one count of receiving stolen property over $250, according to the Globe. He pleaded not guilty during a Saturday and is being held without bail.  In 60 days, bail will be set at $250,000 – he will only be released into house arrest with GPS monitoring, be forbidden to use the internet, not be allowed to make contact with the victim and not be allowed unsupervised contact with children under 16, the Globe noted. Classified as a Level 3 sex offender, Good has ‘been determined to be at a high risk to reoffend and to pose a high degree of dangerousness to the public,’ according to the Massachusetts sex offender database. His previous conviction stemmed from an October 2007 online sex sting during which a cop posed online as a 13-year-old girl, according to the Herald. The two had a graphic chat and agreed to meet at a coffee shop, Good served two and a half years in prison, according to WCVB.","Craig Good was classified as a Level 3 sex offender, considered 'most likely to re-offend'

Chadmila Lopez pleaded guilty to taking the haul of jewellery from Bettye Musham's Upper East Side flat whilst she worked for the former designer brand executive.

In 1981 William Dillon was a happy-go-lucky 21-year-old man who had everything to live for. A supremely talented high school baseball player, he had just been selected for a final trial with the Detroit Tigers who appeared desperate to have him sign a contract. And William, known to his friends as Billy, could well have become as star - a powerful 6ft 4ins, he could throw 90mph with ease. Curveballs, sliders even the new and tricky split-finger fastball, he could do it all. Free: William Dillon who served 27 years in prison after being framed for the gruesome murder of man in 1981 . But in a shocking miscarriage of justice, the only ball William would get to play for the next 27 years would be behind prison walls, as detailed in an sbnation.com feature. On December 4, 1981, a jury found William Dillon guilty of the murder of 40-year-old James Dvorak, an openly gay construction supervisor, who was found beaten to death in Canova Beach Park, Florida. Dvorak was found at a place known locally as 'Queer Pier', a popular pick-up spot for gay men. His face had been smashed in and his lips ripped off. To the jury who sent him down, the evidence against William would have been more than compelling. There was the testimony of a 56-year-old gay man called John Parker who claimed to have been in the Canova Beach Park car lot when a blood-splattered William emerged from the woods. Parker said he had paid William $20 for oral sex and that the next day he had found Wiliam's bloody t-shirt in the back of his pick-up truck with the words 'surf -it' on the front. William's then girlfriend Dona Parish testified she had found William on the night of the murder standing next to the dead body, bloody and shirtless. And then there was dog-handler John Preston, whose amazing sniffer dog had managed to trace William's scent all the way from the courthouse to the scene of the crime. In addition, a man who William had shared a cell with while awaiting trial in jail claimed William had confessed to the murder and had even demonstrated how he had killed Dvorak. For the young William sitting in the dock it must have been a living nightmare. If truth be told he was no angel. He was known to be openly homophobic, although in 1981 as a young straight man it would be more unusual if he wasn't. Dillon, performed an emotional rendition of the National Anthem before a match at the Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. last year . He liked a drink and smoked marijuana, and by some accounts used to crash parties to steal booze and drugs. As he heard the evidence against him he mouthed off in court on more than one occasion and had to be repeatedly told to quieten down by the judge. Knowing he was innocent, William had never arranged for a lawyer to be present at the initial interviews and right up until the last moment he felt sure justice would prevail. In fact all the evidence against him was a sham. Just 12 days after the trial, the girlfriend Donna Parish retracted her entire story and admitted she had been having sex with a police Sergeant investigating the case. She said a member of the Brevard County Sheriff's Office had told her she would 'rot in jail' if she didn't testify against William. Despite this the judge refused to hold a retrial saying there was still enough evidence to convict William without her testimony. But John Preston, whose amazing sniffer dog had seemingly manged to track William's scent so spectacularly was later exposed as a conman. When his dogs were subjected to independent tests they failed and his tracking dog trainer's certificate was found to be a forgery. He had apparently been fed information by the Sheriff's Department so he could repeatedly pick out William as the offender. And John Parker - who had identified William as the man he had given a lift to after emerging blood-splattered from the woods - had originally given a description that bore no resemblance at all to William. While Parker told police the man had a short curly hair and a thin mustache, William was clean shaven with long shaggy hair. John Chapman, the man who claimed William had confessed to him while awaiting trial, later admitted he'd lied to avoid charges being brought against him and that a sheriff's agent had told him exactly what to say. But in December 1981 William was sent to Florida State Prison, home to some of the country's most violent offenders. On his first night he was attacked by five men who took turns in raping him. After that he was raped on a regular basis. Governor Rick Scott signs a bill for Dillon's wrongful conviction as the 52-year-old, left, looks on . He was put on laundry duty with Ted Bundy, the serial rapist and murderer. It would have been a terrible experience for any man, but for someone who knew he was innocent, it must have been unbearable. His only release was learning the guitar and playing prison softball, at which he excelled. As the years passed he continued to play, even after his knees gave way and he had to drag himself from base to base. In . many U.S. prisons, if you don't play softball, chances you bet on it . and as William gained a reputation for fielding winning teams it meant . he earned protection from the prison's big men. In 1996 Wilton Dedge, a man who had . been convicted of raping a woman at knifepoint applied for evidence in . his case to undergo the then brand new DNA testing. In 2001 the tests proved he had not committed the crime and in 2004 he was finally released. The following year William, who had by then spent 24 years behind bars, applied for DNA testing in his own trial. The . incriminating yellow T-shirt discovered in the back of John Parker's . pick-up truck was found to have none of William's DNA on it. The traces . of blood were from the victim James Dvorak and another man. Billy Dillon spent 27 years behind bars until DNA evidence proved his innocence . Despite . this the state still rejected calls for a new trial based on DNA . evidence and instead scheduled a evidentiary hearing for 2009. But . William was released, albeit on a $100,000 bond, and on November 18 . 2008 he took his first steps of freedom in well over a quarter of a . century. In a detailed and . fascinating interview with writer Brandon Sneed, William recalled: 'The . feeling is something you only reach a few times in your life. 'It's a man in the desert who finally finds water.' Just a few weeks after the evidentiary hearing the state filed a nole prosequi meaning they had decided to dismiss all charges. A few years later in 2012 William was granted a full pardon by Florida Governor Rick Scott. After he was cleared the Brevard County Sheriff's Office reopened the Dvorak case. Eventually a man named Phil Huff, who was 17 at the time came forward. He said that for years he had been desperate to confess and that on the night of Dvorak's death he had been hanging out on the beach, drinking and smoking marijuana with three other men Daryl Novak, Eric Novak and James Johnstone. According to Huff, Dvorak had approached the group and they had started chatting. He had a beer and a few drags on one of the joints being passed around. Dvorak and Johnstone then wandered off. After a while the other members of the group went looking for them. When they were discovered the couple having sex in the woods, Johnstone pretended he was being attacked and started punching Dvorak. The Novak brothers joined in the attack. At one point Dvorak managed to get up and run away but the according to Huff, the Novaks chased him down the beach and continued the beating until Dvorak was still. When fresh DNA tests were carried out on the shirt, the James Johnstone was found to match.","William 'Billy' Dillon looked set to be signed by the Detroit Tigers in 1981 .

The internet giant Amazon could be hauled before MPs just like Google, MPs suggested yesterday after serious doubts were raised about how much tax it pays in this country. The company, which sells everything from books to bread, said it paid just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year. But the Seattle-based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount, claiming the UK sales were actually more than £4billion. Scrutiny: Amazon paid just £2.4million in corporation tax despite UK sales of more than £320million last year . Margaret Hodge, the outspoken chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has slammed Amazon’s tiny tax bill as a ‘joke.’ Last night, she said: ‘We will now consider whether we need to recall them to explain that discrepancy.’ It comes after a Google executive, Matt Brittin, a vice-president of the search firm, was grilled by MPs yesterday for the second time. The controversy is fuelled by Amazon, like many multinational businesses, using a complex and legal corporate structure to minimise the amount of tax it pays. Questions: Amazon employs thousands of people in the UK warehouses but, for accounting purposes, is registered in Luxembourg . It claims the heart of its European operations are in Luxembourg, although it employs just 500 people and has no warehouses in the small European nation. By comparison, its UK operation is . gigantic, employing around 4,200 staff as well as thousands of extra . seasonal workers during the busy Christmas trading period. In a further blow for taxpayers, it also receives Government grants and money from the European Union for operating warehouses in less prosperous parts of the country. Last year, it received grants totalling £2.5million. When a sale is made in the UK, the item, such as a book or a DVD, is delivered from a British warehouse by Amazon’s UK employees. But, for accounting purposes, the transaction is processed in Luxembourg. By comparison, the well-known London bookshop, Foyles, states clearly in its latest accounts: ‘All sales were made in the United Kingdom.’ An Amazon spokesman said: ‘Amazon pays all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within. ‘We have a single European headquarters in Luxembourg with hundreds of employees to manage this complex operation.’ A spokesman for HM Revenue and Customs said: ‘HMRC ensures that multinationals pay the tax due in accordance with UK tax law and in doing so we apply the permanent establishment rules correctly and consistently to all businesses. ‘We have been very successful in reducing tax avoidance by large businesses in recent years.’","Paid just £2.4million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year .

The autopsy of a young woman whose body was found in the Colorado River after she disappeared while rafting through the Grand Canyon has revealed that she had been drinking excessively at the time of her death. The body of Kaitlin Kenney, who turned 21 during the month-long rafting trip that lead to her death, was found in late March after a two-month search following her January 11 disappearance. Previous reports speculated that she may have taken hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time of her death, since she was said to have brought them on the rafting trip with her, but the autopsy showed that she only had alcohol in her system. Worst fear confirmed: Officials found the body of Kaitlin Anne Kenney, 21, in the Colorado River, two months after disappearing during a rafting trip with friends . Even still, her apparent decision to . drink during the trip comes in contrast to her journal entries where she . wrote about the dangers of imbibing while on a self-guided rafting . trip. 'Drinking out of . control or to the point of unconsciousness is probably the most . dangerous thing we can be doing out there,' she wrote in a journal entry . dated four days before she disappeared. 'She might just have wanted to let loose,' her brother Ryan Kenney told the AP, even though he said she was not a big drinker. Kenney was on the trip with a group of friends and they had boxes of wine and beer among their supplies. No drugs: Kenney had brought hallucinagenic mushrooms on the trip with her and taken some in the days leading up to her death but the autopsy didn't show any traces in her system on that fateful night . The friends told investigators that they also shared whiskey with a passing group who visited them at their campsite. In . the days leading up to her disappearance on the night of January 11, . Kenney had eaten some of the hallucinogenic mushrooms that she brought . with her, but their effects would have likely worn off by the time she . walked away from the campfire that fateful night.

Kenney, . who was an accomplished musician, woke up 30 minutes earlier than the . rest of her group and went on a walk upstream, bringing her mandolin . with her. Free spirit: Kenney was an anthropology major at University of Montana and an accomplished musician who played the fiddle and the mandolin . Firm clues: The autopsy report said that she had a blood alcohol level of 0.11 at the time of her death, which is significantly higher than the legal driving limit of 0.8 . Her body was found floating in the river two months later. She was back by . breakfast, and the day carried on as normal except that friends reported . that she began slurring her words as the day went on, with her speech . becoming more and more incoherent.

A 37-year-old woman has been arrested and charged after a 3-year-old girl she was supposed to watching drowned in a swimming pool. Kariasa Thomas was arrested on Friday and charged with reckless injury to a child after Kanyce Giddings’ lifeless body was found in an apartment complex pool in the Red Bird neighborhood of Dallas. According to the arrest warrant affidavit, on June 22 Thomas took her best friend’s four children, aged seven, six, five and three years old, to swim in the pool at her apartment complex. Even though Kanyce, right in green, couldn't swim, Kariasa Thomas, left, told her to stand in the pool and watch her siblings swim . She also brought her 16-year-old daughter and husband, who is legally blind. The affidavit states that when the group arrived at the pool about 7 p.m., it had already closed for the day, but they decided to stay after seeing other people still in the water. Even though Thomas knew Kanyce could not swim and wasn’t wearing any kind of flotation device, she allowed the child to get in the water. The affidavit states that Thomas told Kanyce to stand on the steps with her feet in the water while the other children swam. When Thomas walked in the pool, she kicked the child's lifeless body with her foot . Thomas told detectives that she was sitting in a reclining chair a few feet from where the child was playing, but that instead of watching the girl, she logged onto Facebook on her phone for nearly 15 minutes while the children played. In addition to being on her phone, she also played with her pet pit bull ‘Sugar’. 'It was unreasonable and reckless for the suspect to spend an estimated 15 minutes on Facebook and all the time playing with her pit bull 'Sugar' while the [child] was in the pool without any supervision,' the arrest warrant reads. Almost two hours later an off-duty Dallas police officer, who also worked as a security guard at the apartment complex, told the group the pool was closed. KariasaThomas' last Facebook post, from April, reads: 'Hey everybody Im back n ready to act a fool' But when Thomas began to gather the children she couldn't find the 3-year-old Kanyce. The affidavit states that when Thomas walked in the pool, she kicked the child’s lifeless body. Thomas immediately gave the child to the off-duty officer, who began performing CPR while 911 was called. The child was taken to a local hospital but was pronounced dead. Thomas faces up to 20 years in prison if indicted and convicted on the reckless injury charge. She is being held in Dallas County Jail on a $25,000 bond.

'From where they were, they could see it . picking up,' he said, disputing earlier claims that they did not notice the sudden change. McDonough said that the team urged him to retreat if he needed to. He responded that they should contact him if they needed anything and his captain, Jesse Steed, simply replied: 'All right, I'll see you soon.' But at 4.47pm, a radio call came through that the men had been forced to deploy their emergency fire shelters in a last ditch effort to save their lives.

Deputy state forester Jerry Payne last week sparked anger when he blamed the crew's leader Eric Marsh, who perished with his men, for violating firefighting rules - but other state officials criticized him for the conclusion.

Today’s announcement that the next Star Wars film will be shot and produced in the UK is great news for fans and our creative industries, and it is clear evidence that our incentives are attracting the largest studios back to the UK. ‘I am personally committed to seeing more great films and television made in Britain.’ The exact locations for the production is not being confirmed, but there is speculation that at least some scenes will be shot in Scotland. The film will be the beginning of a new Star Wars trilogy that will take place sometime after the events of Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. It is expected to feature a new generation of heroes, as well as an older Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Then and now: Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, recently joked that she will have to 'get in really good shape' to reprise the role in the new film . Producer Bryan Burk said the locations were ‘kind of floating around in the air all depending on script and a whole bunch of other issues’. Multiple global locations were used between 1976 and 2003 for the production of the first six Star Wars films to provide the setting for alien planets, . Some of the early movies were shot at Ealing and Elstree Studios. The costumes of the stormtroopers, Darth Vader, and C-3PO were made by British craftspeople using ‘vacu-forming’ and sculpting . Other scenes in the first six films have been shot in the US, Tunisia, Norway, Italy and Switzerland. Fisher revealed this month how she needs to get in shape for the the new film. She told the Calgary Herald: 'I'm glad they are doing a new movie because they are sending a trainer to my house so I can get in really good shape. 'So I'm really eating a lot of sugar in advance, as you can see. By the time I really get down to it I will have eaten everything.'","Original stars including Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are expected back in Britain for Star Wars: Episode 7 .

If beleaguered Anthony Weiner fails in his bid to win New York's upcoming mayoral election, it turns out he at least has a fallback option... as a British television presenter. But when that day finally comes, whatever you do, just don't ask him to do the weather. In his latest cringe-worthy performance in front of the cameras, the former Congressman attempted to deflect a tough question from an English reporter in New York yesterday by answering in a bizarre fake-British accent. And if witnesses thought it couldn't get any worse, he then tried to melt the joke's frosty reception by attempting to perform an English weather forecast. Scroll down for video. 'Am I in a Monty Python sketch?' Anthony Weiner appeared to mock British television reporter Lucy Watson when she asked him if anything would stop him after a campaign event . Odd behaviour: Deploying a bizarre fake-British accent, Weiner told ITV's Daybreak, 'I just have a feeling I've like stepped into a Monty Python bit... 'I don't know would anything stop me?' Now is a rock going to fall on my head?' The achingly awkward episode began when ITV Daybreak's Lucy Watson asked him after a campaign event if anything would stop him in his bid to be the city's new mayor. Laughing, he said: 'I just have a feeling I've like stepped into a Monty Python bit... 'I don't know would anything stop me?' Now is a rock going to fall on my head?' And as any comedian worth his salt knows, the best way to comeback after a joke falls on its face is to swiftly tell better one. So he offered: 'Is there anything else I can do for ITV? Do you want me to do the weather or something?' As reporter Lucy Watson duly obliged, he said: 'It's going to be rainy, cloudy and grey so do what you can guys, try to keep your head up and keep a stiff upper lip.' He was perhaps unaware that Britain has, ironically, been enjoying its hottest and driest summer for almost ten years. Not so sunny: He then did a mock report on the UK weather, advising Brits to 'keep a stiff upper lip' It is the latest of a string of gaffes by Weiner, whose poll lead has evaporated following revelations that he continued to exchange sexually explicit messages online after he resigned from Congress in 2011. It comes just months after Mr Weiner resigned as a Congressman amid a massive sex scandal that burst his well-known career in flames. The New Yorker was caught sending sexually explicit photos to a bevy of young women on Twitter. Beleaguered: Anthony Weiner fights off criticism as he campaigns in Staten Island, New York, last month . Humiliation: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin attend a news conference in New York last month . After initially denying the authenticity of the photos, he was forced to admit that he had in fact been sending them while he was married to his wife, Huma Abedin. He and Ms Abedin, a longtime personal aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were married for less than a year when the photos were discovered and the scandal tarnished his name. Adding another layer of disgrace to the situation was the fact that Ms Abedin was pregnant with the couple's first child- Jordan- when the scandal broke in May of last year.

Known for his brash personality and lofty career aspirations - he was expected to run for Mayor of New York City after Michael Bloomberg's term ends next year - Mr Weiner has been keeping an uncharacteristically low profile. But it is not the first gaffe he has made in front of the cameras. He recently raised eyebrows at a political meeting in Brooklyn when he suggested that an elderly woman in the audience might be flirting with him. Weiner was taking questions from attendees at a Friends of the United Block Association of Brooklyn meeting when he noticed a gesture from one woman. ‘Were you raising your hand or flirting with me?’ Weiner asked the woman, who had tentatively raised her hand.","Weiner made joke after ITV Daybreak asked him if anything would stop him .

Dominique Strauss-Kahn was the ‘King’ of the orgies he attended at glamorous hotels all over the world, judges believe. The former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief’s ‘central pivot’ status in a well organised vice ring is what has led to him being prosecuted. Judges in Lille, northern France, have announced that the 64-year-old will stand trial for pimping, and he faces up to 10 years in prison. He admits attending swingers' parties over many years, but insists he did not know the women were prostitutes. Scroll down for video... Former International Monetary Fund head Strauss-Kahn has been charged with pimping in Lille . But today’s Le Figaro newspaper quotes . judicial sources as saying that Strauss-Kahn was ‘King of the Party’ and knew exactly what was going on. Legal documents suggests that . Strauss Kahn was fully aware that ‘the girls’ were being paid the . equivalent of thousands of pounds for their services. He even made an apartment available . for some of the orgies – an act which was ‘a material act of pimping’, . according to the judges. At least two prostitutes have told . investigators that they were paid to attend the parties, and that all . those attending knew this. Judges have dismissed defence claims that all of those attending the parties were consensual adults who did not exchange money. Separated: Dominique Strauss-Kahn with his wife Anne Sinclair, . pictured outside Manhattan criminal court in 2011, at the time of the . alleged offences . Strauss-Kahn has said that he did not . know what any of the women did ‘because they had their clothes off’ and . all looked the same. Richard Malka, Strauss-Kahn’s lawyer, . meanwhile insists that Strauss-Kahn is at the centre of a ‘relentless’ campaign to smear his name, and that he would use his trial to ‘denounce . the absurdity and abnormality of this aggravated pimping complaint’. Women selling themselves for sex is . not illegal in France, but aggravated pimping is, and carries a maximum . sentence of 10 years and a fine equivalent to 1.2 million pounds. Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo maintained her claims the she was the victim of a 'violent, sadistic attack,' despite criminal charges being dropped . Strauss-Kahn is now formally under ‘judicial control’, which means he cannot leave France and has to report to police regularly. It is the latest in a string of legal . problems for Strauss-Kahn, who once faced accusations that he tried to . rape women in both New York and Paris. In 2011 Strauss-Kahn was accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York chamber maid, of trying to rape her. Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn proved that a . sex act which took place was consensual, but Strauss Kahn was forced to . step down from his 500,000-dollars a-year job at the IMF. Diallo then sued Strauss-Kahn, but the . two sides reached a financial settlement late last year, the details of . which have never been disclosed. Last October, a French prosecutor . dropped a criminal investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to a possible . gang rape in Washington DC. A Belgian woman withdrew her . allegations, and said she would not press charges, despite initially . insisting she had been attacked by Strauss Kahn. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of . attempted rape two years ago when Tristane Banon, a young Paris writer, . said he had tried to rape her in 2003. But prosecutors said the case could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations. Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a counter claim in France, alleging slander.

A stripper was found guilty on Thursday of the attempted murder of her fiance who had drained his 401k supporting her before ending their relationship. Vicky Miller, 44, of Plano, Texas, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine - the maximum penalty for the second-degree felony conviction. Her former fiancé Paul Key, 54, had testified that Miller, her son, . Francisco Hurtado, and family friend Dunkan Boyce tried to kill him when . he went to her house in November 2011 to collect his belongings. Stripper Vicky Miller, left, has been sentenced to 20 years for the attempted murder of her fiance Paul Key, right . The pair had meet in 2008 when she was dancing topless at Lipstick Cabaret in Dallas and he asked her to marry him after just 30 minutes. During the trial Key claimed that he drained his 401k and took out a mortgage on his home so he could lavish Miller, who faces unrelated charges of aggravated sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy, with gifts including a car each for her and her son. 'I agreed to support her financially,' Key testified, adding that he spent cash he'd saved over 30 years on the woman. 'I had someone I enjoyed talking with. I thought I could buy loyalty with money.' He said they regularly met up for breakfast at IHOP following their night shifts and he paid her $2,000 a month to support her so she would quit her job at Lipstick Cabaret. Accomplices: Miller's son Francisco Hurtado and friend Dunkan Boyce, right, helped her try to kill Paul Key and are both waiting for trial dates in their own cases . But the affair, which Key claimed was . non-sexual, turned sour after Miller kept putting off the wedding and . after three and a half years Key, an AT&T employee, began to think . he was being used, Dallasnews.com reported. He said he decided to break up with her and move forward with his life. Key, . who had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at age 35, said he . had stopped taking his medication about two months before the breakup . because he was strapped for cash. But . he said that had no impact on his ability to remember the alleged . attempted murder, which he claimed may have been prompted by the . inaccurate belief that Miller would receive his life insurance payout. On November 21, 2011, Miller picked . up Key at his home and brought him to her apartment so he could pick up . her belongings, court documents reveal. When he had done so he sat down . on the couch. Scene: The attempted murder took place at Miller's apartment, pictured, in Plano, Texas . That's when he claims someone yanked an extension cord over his head and around his neck trying to strangle him. Miller's son, Francisco Hurtado, who is now 19, allegedly then placed a pillow over his head and tried to suffocate the man before his friend, Dunkan Boyce, struck him over the head several times with a pan, police said. As the extension cord began to cut off his air supply, Key testified on Tuesday that his 'initial inclination was to sit back and observe what it's like to die.' But then he said 'I decided to fight back.' Key managed to escape the boys' clutches and ran outside screaming for help, finally convincing someone at a nearby Dollar General Store to call 911. Meanwhile, the teens decided to make it look like Key attacked Miller and rearranged the apartment. Miller also allegedly asked her son to throw her against a wall, hit her and kick her so she looked beat up. The . son's friend, Boyce, then calls 911 to report the false assault, but . can be heard on the call shouting at the others to hurry up. Lipstick Cabaret: Paul Key said he met Vicky Miller at the Dallas strip club . When police arrive, Key was initially arrested by reporting officers but after further investigation, Miller and the two teens were arrested. During the trial, defense attorney Robbie McClung had told jurors not to judge Miller by her former profession. 'There's not just reasonable doubt,' McClung said. 'There are misperceptions (sic) and innuendo that don't make any sense because Vicky Miller is not guilty.' In the end the jury took less than three hours to find her guilty. Miller is awaiting sentencing for the second-degree felony charge. Hurtado and Boyce are both waiting for trial dates in their own cases.","Vicky Miller, 44, has been found guilty of the 2011 attempted murder of Paul Key .

Attacker: Yuri Zarutsky today said he acted alone in the acid attack, which is a contradiction of previous statements . The man accused of throwing a jar of sulphuric acid in Sergei Filin's face said he acted alone and top Bolshoi dancer Pavel . Dmitrichenko did not pay him to commit the assault. In a reversal of previous statements, Yuri Zarutsky, who was alleged to be the hired 'hitman' who became involved in the attack on Mr Dmitrichenko's behalf, said he initiated the attack independently. The surprising development comes five months after Mr  Dmitrichenko, 29 admitted to paying Mr Zarutsky £1,080 to attack Sergei Filin. Known as 'Ivan the Terrible' for his talent for . playing ballet villains, the star soloist confessed to police that he ordered the attack in January after his girlfriend was snubbed for a role. Police released video footage of Mr Dmitrichenko saying he organised the attack, but 'not in the way that it turned out'. He argued he expected Mr Zarutsky to beat Mr Filin up. He claimed at an earlier court hearing . that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 . January attack on Filin. 'When I heard what happened to Sergei, I was just in shock,' he said. 'I could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid.' Yuri Zarutsky confessed his guilt today, and called for the two other defendants to be exonerated. Mr Zarutsky is accused of accepting . money from dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko and carrying out the attack on . Sergei Filin. Mastermind: Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has confessed to ordering the attack on Mr Filin but argues that he only wanted him to be beaten up and did not ask for acid to be used . Motive: Pavel Dmitrichenko is said to have been upset about the treatment of his Bolshoi partner Anzhelina . Vorontsova, 21 . A third man, Andrei Lipatov, is accused of driving Mr . Zarutsky to and from the scene of the crime outside Mr Filin's home. The latest confession means the men could be tried individually rather than as 'a group acting in collusion'. They . would face 12 years in prison if they are convicted of a group crime, . but eight years if they are charged with an individual act. If tried as 'a group acting in . collusion,' the men face up to 12 years in prison, as opposed to eight . if they are tried individually. Injuries: Sergei Filin has lost 95per cent of his sight and is completely blind in his right eye despite having 18 surgeries to save his vision . Filin's lawyer Tatiana Stukalova told Interfax: 'They are trying to break down the ""group"" and the ""collusion""'. Sergei Filin, 42, was left with severe burns to his eyes and face from the attack. He has lost 95 per cent of his sight and is totally blind in his right eye. He flew to Germany from Moscow for treatment in March and had 18 operations in an attempt to save his sight. In April a judge in Moscow rejected Mr Dmitrichenko's plea to be released on bail pending the results of a police investigation, deeming him a flight risk.","Yuri Zarutsky is the alleged hitman who was hired by top ballet dancer .

A study has found people who are dating, in a serious relationship or co-habiting, are the most frequent sexters . Approximately 80 percent of 21-year-olds have received 'sext' messages, while just under 50 percent of young adults have shared nude or semi-nude photos of themselves using a smartphone, scientists said. While some people might send a sext in the hope it will lead to a hook-up, a study has found people who are dating, in a serious relationship or co-habiting, are the most frequent sexters. The results could mean couples are either spicing up their sex lives or cheating by sexting several people, but the research did find that single people and married couples sext least frequently. The study said: 'Single individuals had significantly . stronger negative expectancies about sending and receiving sexts . compared to others who were in some romantic relationship.' Scientists found sexting behaviour and the outcome people expect from sexting may differ depending on a person's gender, relationship status, and sexual identity. The study, published in Cyberpsychology, Behaviour and Social Networking, said 80 percent of 21-year-olds have received sext messages, while 67 percent have sent them. Around 46 percent of young people have sent revealing or nude photos of themselves to another person using a mobile phone, while 64 percent have received them. Men were found to send more sexts, more frequently to more people, compared with women, according to the research by Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, which questioned 611 university students, 42 percent of which said they were in serious relationships. The study suggests women are less engaged with the joy of sexting than men. Allyson Dir, author of the study, said females may be more pressured into sexting by male peers.

Writing in the journal, Ms Dir said: 'Much of our understanding about sexting comes from media and anecdotal reports about the dangers of sexting.' 'Negative beliefs about sexting include . the potential for legal ramifications the risk of sexts being shared . with others and the resulting cyberbullying social humiliation, and . psychological distress.' However as sexting is a prevalent behaviour among young people, there are potentially a number of positive outcomes from the activity, she said. The study found 27 percent of people said sending sexts makes them feel desirable and excited, and the study found  young people mainly felt they were 'fun and flirataceous' or said sexts are a way of experimenting with their sexuality. However,16 percent of people admitted to being embarrassed by sending sexts, perhaps indicating a level of peer pressure was involved.

Robert and Ethel Kennedy hired Ena Bernard in 1951 to care for their newborn daughter Kathleen. But over the next 44 years, Ena's job would grow to include raising all 11 children in the growing Kennedy brood and staying on as a member of the family long after the youngest child was out of the house. Ms Bernard died last week at the age of 105 at her home in Sunrise, Florida. 85-year-old Ethel and all but one of her living children - Joe, Bobby, Kathleen, Kerry, Christopher, Maxwell, Douglas and Rory -  attended her funeral Thursday. Beloved: Ena Bernard, who was the nanny to Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children for 44 years, was laid to rest Thursday at the age of 105. Above, Joe Kennedy, right, visits Ena in her later years . At the funeral, Ena's only child Josefina 'Fina' Harvin and three of the Kennedy children gave eulogies. 'Really . I am not the one most qualified [to give the eulogy],' Harvin said. 'The . Kennedy family are the ones most qualified because she was with them . for 44 years. My mom was with the Kennedys for so long, we became like . an intertwined family.' Josefina joined her mother in the U.S. when she was a teenager and lived with the Kennedys when she wasn't at school. When she arrived in the U.S., Josefina was embraced by the clan as one of their own, she told MailOnline. Devoted nanny: Ena with some of the Kennedy Children. The photo is from Robert Kennedy and reads: To Ena, Who has kept them looking up all this time. Affectionately, Robert Kennedy . Josefina recalls a rather protective Bobby Kennedy giving her a stern talking to when she came home at 3am after cotillion. As . she was walking up the stairs to her mothers quarters at Hickory Hill, . Bobby emerged from the den asking: 'What time is this for a young lady . to come back home?' She explained that her mother had given her permission to stay out late. 'I don't care,' he replied. 'Your father is not here and I am your father away from home.' But . he also helped her transition to her new life in America, once calling . up Otis Air National Guard Base to secure a date for Josefina. She can't . remember his name, only that he was from Chico, California. Remembered: Bobby Kennedy playing with two of his children, with Ena it the background. Wife Ethel and eight of his children attended Ena's funeral Thursday . Beginnings: Ena joined the Kennedy family in 1951 when she started out as a nurse for their then only-child Kathleen . Ethel Kennedy was also a mother figure to young Josefina, who gave Josefina her first job helping out her mother for $25dollars a week. It was enough money then for her to start her first bank account. In her early years, Josefina wouldn't make eye contact with any of the Kennedys, believing that was the way she was supposed to interact with her employers. Ethel called her out for the habit, telling her: 'No. You're in America. When someone speaks to you, you look them in the eyes.' They treated Josefina with respect, even inviting her to the dinner table when they had Al Gore over as a guest. Perks of the job: During her time with the Kennedys, Ena met many important people such as Bill Clinton . Josefina thanked the family in the Sun Sentinel for the way they treated her mother, in a time when the help were still treated 'like a piece of furniture' by the wealthy. She recalled how Bobby and Ethel always introduced her mother to guests. Ena with Joe Kennedy outside the the U.S. Capitol building. The letter reads: 'To Ena, whose love and guidance taught me most of the rules of the house, both at home and in Congress' At the funeral, the Kennedy children spoke about their memories of Ena and the affect she had on their lives. Maxwell . remembered how he would pray every night that God wouldn't take her . away because when the kids would get too wild she would tell them: 'You . children are going to kill me. And then what's going to happen to Fina?' Kerry remembers Ena threatening a 'pow-pow' or hit across the head, but said that it was always an empty gesture. 'She never raised a hand to us,' she said. 'Instead she prodded us along with joy and humor. 'I . don't know what I would without the love and care Ena gave me,' Douglas . said. 'Her love is as close to God's love as I think I will ever . experience.' Bobby thanked Ena's family for 'loaning her to us' for over 40 years. 'We . were so lucky to have her in our lives,' he said. 'The best proof that . God loves the Kennedy family is that he gave us Ena for all those . years.' Friends for life: Ena and Ethel at Ena's 100th birthday party in June 2008 . Ena worked as a nanny for a prominent family in Costa Rica before moving to the U.S. When she moved, she left behind her only-daughter Josefina until she could could afford to move her. The Kennedys were one of two families she was sent to interview with when she first moved. Over the years, where the Kennedys went - Ena went. That meant trips to Cape Cod in the summer, Palm Beach for Easter and her own room at the family's homestead Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia. Part of the family: Ena would stay with the family for over 44 years - long after the youngest child Rory left the house. She had her own room at the family's homestead of Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia . Ena was there when Bobby was sworn in as attorney general in January 1961. After the ceremony she went with the six oldest children to take a tour of the White House and shrieked in surprise as Bobby slid down a bannister, all six children following behind. 'Oh Mr. Kennedy!' Ena shouted. 'Sliding down the bannister at the White House! Imagine that! I can't believe it! Mr. Kennedy, you'll never grow up!' Introductions: Ena meeting Ronald Reagan. Daughter Josefina was once asked to eat dinner with the Kennedys when they had Al Gore over as a guest . During her time with the family, she met the likes of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Desmond Tutu and the Pope. Most . importantly, Ena was there after Bobby was assassinated - helping a . grieving Ethel move on and care for the children without a father. 'After . our father died, my mother had to play both roles,' Chris Kennedy told . the Los Angeles Times. 'Ena backfilled and was always loving and . supportive.' Assassinated: Bobby Kennedy was shot on June 5, 1968 while campaigning in California for the Democratic Party nomination. He died the next day . Mourning: A veiled Ethel Kennedy leads the funeral procession of her children out of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York on June 8, 1968. Ethel was pregnant with daughter Rory at the time of her husband's death . Fatherless: Ethel Kennedy and her children visit Robert Kennedy's gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of his assassination in 1971 . Mother figure: Rory Kennedy introduces one of her children to Ena . After . the youngest child, Rory, had grown-up, Ena stayed on continuing . to do odd jobs for the family until Josefina wanted to retire and she moved with her to Florida. The . family's devotion for their beloved nanny never waned. The children would introduce their boyfriends and girlfriends to Ena, . asking for her approval. They would bring over newborn children like . they would for a grandmother. Later years: The Kennedy family never forgot their nanny. They set her up with a medical plan and pension and she got at least one phone call a week from her adopted family. Above, Douglas pays a visit . When she turned 100 in June 2008, the Kennedys attended Ena's party at the Signature Grand in Davie, Florida. The even gave her a little award which read: 'For Ena, who captured the hearts of the whole family and whose 50 years of giving Pow-Pow has made us all better.' She leaves behind six grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and nine 'adopted' Kennedy children.

The website blamed for the death of Hannah Smith have offered to name the trolls who tormented her . The brothers behind Ask.fm have announced a ‘full and independent’ review of the site last night, amid mounting pressure in the wake of a teenage girl’s suicide linked to the website. The Latvian-based site makes around £5million each year in advertising aimed at its 60million registered users, but a string of tragedies have been blamed on it, including that of 14-year-old Hannah Smith last Friday. Founders Mark and Ilja Terebin said last night: ‘We recognise the importance of acting quickly and decisively to ensure our users and their parents do not lose confidence in our social network.’ They have engaged the London  law firm Mishcon de Reya to conduct ‘a full and independent audit’ of the site and its safety features. Lawyers and media specialists will carry out a detailed investigation into the procedures and policies in place, and report back with findings and recommendations in the next seven days. Hannah was found hanged in her bedroom after suffering months of abuse by bullies on Ask.fm who urged her to kill herself, cut herself and ‘drink bleach’. Her father David Smith, 45, from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, has accused the site of ‘making millions out of people’s misery’ and called for it and similar websites to be properly regulated. The Terebins yesterday repeated an earlier claim that they wanted ‘to provide a safe environment for our users’. ‘We are committed to safeguarding against bullying and harassment in all forms and would welcome the opportunity to collaborate with our colleagues across the industry to do this,’ they said. The Terebins, the wealthy sons of a Red Army officer, have also promised to hand over details of her abusers after Prime Minister David Cameron urged parents, teenagers and advertisers to boycott the site. Victim: Hannah Smith, 14, was discovered dead the day after posting a heart-breaking message online . In an open letter they wrote: 'Although it is possible to post anonymously to the site, we would like to reassure parents that in almost all cases it is possible for Ask.fm to identify users – through IP technology, everything on the internet is traceable – and in extreme circumstances such as those we’ve experienced this week we work through existing legal frameworks to ensure this information is accessible to the appropriate legal authorities.' Firms such as Vodaphone, Laura Ashley and Specsavers as well as charity Save the Children pulled their adverts yesterday. The open letter came hours after the Prime Minister urged the Terebins, and those running similar sites, to ‘step up to the plate and show some responsibility’. Mr Cameron also urged parents and teenagers to avoid using the ‘vile’ websites. Partners, from left: Marks Terebins, Oskars Liepiøö, Ilja Terebins of the Ask.fm website which has offered to name Hannah Smith's tormentors . Row: Ask.fm has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts . He told Sky News: ‘Just because someone does something online, it doesn’t mean they’re above the law. If you incite someone to do harm, if you incite violence, that is breaking the law, whether that is online or offline. ‘Also, there’s something all of us can do as parents and as users of the internet and that is not to use some of these vile sites. Boycott them, don’t go there, don’t join them – we need to do that as well.’ But some experts believe a ban is too simplistic. Holly Seddon, of parenting and technology website Quib.ly, told The Times: 'Even if (ask.fm) was taken down, there are many other avenues for online and offline bullying. 'There is a danger that if we just fixate on one product, we are not having the conversations we should have, whether that is in the government or with our kids.'","Hannah Smith was found hanged after suffering months of abuse from trolls on Ask.fm .

But, on arriving home, the 34-year-old was horrified to be told by her doctor that the health service was in a ‘shambles’, she would ‘probably die on the waiting list’ – and would be better off going back to Singapore to get treatment there. She eventually did just that but now, five years after successful treatment overseas, remains ‘disgusted’ by what she was told. She said: ‘He clearly had zero sympathy for the situation I was in. He may have been telling the truth but he was so callous about it, he took away any hope I had. ‘Instead of offering treatment and talking about my options he said, “The NHS is a shambles. You’ll probably die on the waiting list.” I was in absolute shock.’ ‘It is not the kind of thing someone with such a low chance of survival expects to hear.’ Miss Guit, from Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2008, shortly after arriving in Singapore, and initially began treatment there. But when doctors began to operate they discovered the cancer had spread, and removed 14 lymph nodes from her groin and legs, as well as her ovaries. The fact the cancer had spread meant Miss Guit’s survival rate had dropped from 80 per cent to 30 per cent. She was told the treatment she would require next would be extremely expensive and was advised to come back home. She said: ‘I knew straight away I couldn’t afford it. I paid a lot of National Insurance tax so expected a high level of care on the NHS.’ But upon visiting her local  doctor in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, she was left devastated by his response. She said: ‘I was in a horrific state. I walked in fully confident he would get me treatment straight away. He looked at me but did not examine me.’ Miss Guit, who worked for RBS, took out loans of nearly £30,000 and sought treatment in Singapore. She received a clear smear test result six weeks later. Miss Guit had started her treatment in Singapore, but was advised to fly home to have the necessary surgeries . There have since been further complications, but she is approaching the five-year cancer-free mark. She said: ‘It’s disgusting that I should have to fly across the world for treatment when I’ve worked in Scotland for most of my life. ‘The NHS needs to do something because they’re playing with lives.’ A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: ‘In 2008 NHS GGC maintained a strong performance on cancer waiting times and over 92 per cent of patients were seen within the waiting times guarantee. ‘NHS care in Greater Glasgow and Clyde is available to all those who need it. We are surprised to learn of the conversation between an independent GP and a patient.’ Miss Guit took out loans of nearly £30,000 to pay for her surgeries in Singapore after she was encouraged to seek treatment there and avoid Britain's waiting lists .","34-year-old Lisa Guit was told she would get better treatment where she was living in Singapore .

Furious passengers staged a sit-down protest on a BA jet after enduring two ‘terrifying’ aborted flights to London in 24 hours. About 70 refused to leave the plane for five hours as it sat on the runway in Saudi Arabia in temperatures of 50C (122F) yesterday. Passengers had screamed and been physically sick as the Heathrow-bound Boeing 747 had to turn round and make an emergency landing shortly after take-off when its wing flaps jammed on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Mayhem: A single member of staff from British Airways tries to deal with 300 angry customers after two terrifying aborted flights to London in 24 hours . Chaos: Customers surround one member of BA staff at the King Khalid International in Saudi . 'Terrifying': Paramedics leave the BA jumbo after treating a passenger who collapsed during the second critical landing in Riyadh . Astonishingly, when they boarded the same plane yesterday the same problem occurred and they had to return to the capital Riyadh again. Before both landings, the packed jet had to circle over the desert dumping 20 tons of fuel to ensure it was light enough to land safely. Ambulances and fire crews ‘chased it down the runway’ as it returned on both occasions, passengers said. In the terminal there was ‘mayhem’ as just one BA worker tried to deal with more than 300 passengers while other ground crew ‘hid’ in a back office, said passenger Dean Jones. ‘Fights broke out and the military turned up,’ he added. ‘We were furious they put us back up in the plane when they knew there was a serious problem. BA customer relations have been useless.’ Emergency: The faulty plane is pictured dumping fuel over the Saudi desert so it could make an emergency landing . Worrying: Passengers became anxious when they saw fuel streaming out of the wing . Flight 262 had been due to leave King Khalid International at 12.40am on Wednesday but was delayed for five hours. It was in the air for about 40 minutes before the pilot announced there was problem with the wing flaps and they would have to return to the airport after dumping fuel. Mr Jones said: ‘We were circling over the desert with fuel streaming out. People were anxious. Then we came back to Riyadh very fast and very low over the city. 'There was screaming and crying. We hit the runway with a massive bang.’ He said they had to make their own way to accommodation, before being told to return to the airport at 3am for a flight on the same plane that eventually took off at 8.45am. Problem: The plane was a British Airways 747 like this one pictured . Return: The flight had to return to King Khalid International Airport, in Riyadh, pictured, twice . Around 30 minutes in, the wing flap problem recurred. Mr Jones said: ‘This time people were even more frightened. Women were crying. People were being sick.’ After landing around 70 passengers refused to leave and called for an official to explain what was happening. The sit-in organiser, who remained anonymous, said: ‘It was extremely hot but we had to make a stand. But nobody came to speak to us.’ Last night BA apologised and said a replacement plane should arrive this morning. It said it was offering passengers compensation, expenses and complimentary tickets, and had arranged hotel accommodation for them.","Around 70 passengers refused to leave the plane for five hours on the runway .

Cruel deception: Emma La Garde, 38, whose face is pixellated to protect her son's anonymity, wrote to him from prison saying she misses him and blaming lies on her being 'poorly' A mother who pretended her son had cancer to claim thousands of pounds of benefits has written to him from prison saying she misses him. Emma La Garde, 38, made her seven-year-old use a wheelchair and shaved his head and eyebrows to mimic the effects of chemotherapy in a scam that made her £86,000. Jailed last November for three years and four months, she has now written to her son explaining that she tricked him and the authorities because she was 'poorly', and saying she would like to see him again. La Garde, who was divorced by the boy's father after he was also taken in by her lies, sent the boy, now aged 11, a two-page letter from Holloway Prison in north London begging for forgiveness. She wrote: 'When mummy was poorly I didn’t do a good job of being a mummy to you and I want to be better so you can be proud of me being your mum again, even grown-ups make mistakes you see.' She told her son, who insists he doesn't want to see her, that she looked forward to seeing him again, and insisted that her cruel deception of him didn't mean she didn't love him. 'I still look out of the window every night and say goodnight to you all and I love you and no matter how far apart we are you are always with me in my heart and I’ll never stop loving or caring about you,' she wrote. La Garde, who tricked not only her . family but also the child's school, health authority and the Department . of Work and Pensions (DWP), asked her son to write to her telling her what he . was up to, and said she missed him. She suggested he might like to do a . drawing or painting for her, and said she was studying new courses in . prison to help her get a job when she is released next year. La Garde told her son, who is now living with his brother and siblings at a secret location, that she and her boyfriend plan to move away from the area when she is released because she thought he wouldn't like to bump into her at the supermarket. She said she planned to see him somewhere where he could have fun, rather than in a family contact centre. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the Mirror he had no intention of seeing his mother at the moment as he was happy living with his father, with whom he enjoyed watching films and eating enchiladas. La Garde, who forged doctors' notes and shaved her son's head, is from Stroud, Gloucestershire (file picture) He said: 'I wouldn’t mind seeing her when I’m a bit older and asking her some stuff – about why she did it.' Now doing well at school, he said he didn't miss his mother, who he said used to give her children ready meals from Tesco, and had not seen her since she was jailed. His childhood was blighted by his mother who began her elaborate deception in 2008 when she took the child, then six, to the doctor when he complained of pains in his legs. Tests found nothing wrong beyond enlarged tonsils, and the GP wrote to the boy's parents giving him the all-clear, but La Garde copied the surgery's template and forged a letter saying he was seriously ill. Initially she said he had ALPS (autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome) causing an enlarged spleen, and notified both his school and the DWP, to claim Disability Living Allowance (DLA). La Garde is now at HMP Holloway, in north London, and told her son she enjoys spending time in the gardens . In 2009 she sent her son to school in a wheelchair donated by the Red Cross and told them he could not do PE, and the following year she sent the school another forged doctor's letter saying her son had lymphoma, a type of cancer, and would have treatment that would make his hair fall out. She then shaved the child's head and eyebrows and made him wear a bandana to school. La Garde told her husband the boy had cancer and doctors said he did not have long to live, before sitting her son down and told him, too. They told their family and friends, and La Garde announced the news on her Facebook page. The child was not allowed to sit on the floor during school assembly and had to sit at the back with teachers, and when La Garde used some of his DLA to take them to Disney World in Florida, she made him stay in his wheelchair and used a disability pass to jump the queues. Meanwhile at home the son, who was perfectly healthy, enjoyed bouncing on his trampoline. The judge at Gloucester Crown Court, pictured, told La Garde her behaviour was 'quite beyond the pale' and jailed her for three years and four months . La Garde was eventually caught when the boy's father, who had lived with her for 12 years, went to discuss him with the school and saw a forged letter with the word 'to' spelled as 'too' - a mistake he knew La Garde always made. He marched to the GP who confirmed that the boy was not ill, and blew the whistle.  He left her when she was arrested in 2010 and divorced her last year. Now 38, the boy's father says her letter, which was sent on May 25 this year, shows she has not changed and is still refusing to acknowledge her fault. Investigators believe La Garde's scam made her more than £100,000, but the official figure was reduced to £85,898 on a technicality. She admitted child cruelty, fraud and forgery and lost custody of her two children from a first marriage and three from the second. The court heard that she was not mentally ill and had used the proceeds of her crime to fund a comfortable lifestyle with four-bedroom detached house, smart new car, and luxury holidays.","Emma La Garde, 38, banked more than £85,000 by lying about young son .

This is the moment paramedics fought to save a mother-of-two allegedly shot dead by her estranged husband  in the street yesterday. The 46-year-old victim, named locally as Caroline Parry, drove to a quiet suburban cul-de-sac in Newport, South Wales, to meet her former partner to exchange belongings at 8.30am yesterday. But Chris Parry, 49, is alleged to have pulled out a shotgun, shooting her twice in the chest and then turned the weapon on himself but 'blew half his face off' in a failed suicide bid. Incident: Paramedics at the scene where Chris Parry shot dead his estranged wife Caroline next to their two cars with their boots open for a possession swap yesterday . Death: The shotgun used in the attack lying on the floor next to a paramedic's bag . Pictures taken in the moments after the killing show his shotgun lying on the grass next to two cars with their boots open. Surgeons were yesterday fighting to save Mr Parry's life and he remains critically ill in hospital. Neighbours have said police had been called 'several times' to the couple's house during blazing rows between the pair in the months leading up to the  shooting. And officers took out two guns from their neat modern mid-terrace house in the city in the hours after the shooting. One neighbour said: 'It is ridiculous that he was left with guns in the house after the police knew there was trouble between them. Why didn't they take his guns before it was too late?' Crime scene: Chris Parry allegedly lured his wife to this Newport street with the promise getting possessions back after their break-up . Caroline had told husband of 27 years Chris she was leaving him for another man. She had moved out of the family home in Cwmbran, South Wales, shared with daughter Naomi, 19, and son Aaron, 16. But Caroline agreed to meet Chris on Thursday morning to hand over some of her belongings at Seabreeze Avenue in Newport. When Chris pulled up in his car at the meeting point he pulled out a single barrel shotgun from his boot - and blew his estranged wife away before trying to kill himself. Police yesterday revealed they knew about the domestic history of the couple and have referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Comission. After the shooting police swooped on the couple's home 10 miles away in Cwmbran, South Wales, where they had lived for 20 years. They were seen taking away two more shotguns from the family home. House: This is the Parry's family home in Cwmbran, South Wales where police were called after Caroline Parry and Chris Parry were seen having blazing rows in the street just weeks before he shot her . A close neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'We often heard them shouting and arguing recently and police had been to the house a few times. 'They took away two shotguns after the shooting and it makes you wonder why they allowed him to keep the guns. 'Chris seemed a nice guy and used to talk a lot about fishing.' His partner added: 'The couple had a furious row in the street about a month ago and Caroline left soon afterwards.'We have been here about a year and they seemed such a nice couple.

Aneeta Prem, founder of Freedom Charity, which helps victims of forced marriage, said: ‘The “Marriage: it’s your choice” card is a concise and accessible way to receive information that could save someone’s life. Innovative: This leaflet aims to help those who are vulnerable to being abducted by their families . ‘It’s vital that young people travelling abroad for a family wedding realise it could be their own wedding – and know who they should contact should they find themselves in danger.’ Between June and August last year the government’s Forced Marriage Unit had more than 400 reported cases, compared with 1,485 cases for the whole year. Crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne said: ‘The rise in forced marriage reports over the school holidays is shocking. ‘Teenagers expecting their GCSE or A-level results should be embarking . on a bright future, not condemned to a marriage with someone they have . never met and do not want to marry. ‘This is a serious abuse of human rights and that is why we are legislating to make it illegal.'

A teenager has died after collapsing at a music festival promoting itself as ‘The UK’s Maddest City’. The 18 year old woman was taken ill at the Boomtown Fair festival, near Winchester, Hampshire, on Friday night, but despite a swift response from paramedics, the teenager was pronounced dead upon on arrival at hospital. Police are not treating the incident as suspicious, but social media users said a death at the festival, where £130,000 worth of drugs were seized last year, was ‘inevitable’. Tragedy: The 18 year old woman died after she collapsed at Boomtown Fair festival in Hampshire on Friday night after what may have been a drug-overdose . The teenager’s family has been told of the tragedy at the festival site at Matterley Bowl, located near Winchester, police said tonight. ‘Boomtown Fair control team and on site emergency services were made aware of a woman in need of medical attention just after 10pm on Thursday, August 8,’ a Hampshire Police spokesman said. ‘On site medical services responded and an 18-year-old woman was taken to the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester but was pronounced dead on arrival. ‘The death is not being treated as suspicious. The woman’s next of kin and the coroner have been informed. ‘Hampshire Constabulary is working with Boomtown Fair organisers to establish the circumstances around the death.’ Chemical controversy: Boomtown Fair, where last year, £130,000 worth of drugs were seized, has been described by its organisers ad the 'maddest town' in the UK . The young woman is believed to have travelled to the festival with a group of friends from outside the county to attend the four-day event, described as a ‘family friendly event’ where tickets cost up to £149. A post mortem is yet to take place but police said drugs form one line of their enquiry. Twitter was rife with speculation surrounding the young woman’s death, with many implying that drugs were involved. Twitter user sashalouxo ‘Rip to the girl who died at boomtown last night. Everyone who does drugs should take note from this. Don’t risk your life for a buzz.’ Another user, JoeGodden12 tweeted: ‘Girl 18 died at boomtown though drugs and alcohol that’s nuts! ??’ Ak-Wharton wrote: ‘So someone has died at Boomtown. As sad as it is, that was inevitable.’ Officers are now ‘reinforcing drug warning messages’ at the festival which is expected to attract 30,000 people this weekend. Boomtown Fair, headlined by Maximo Park, Mystery Jets, and Bob Marley’s son Julian, hosts ska and party bands from around the world, with 24 others offering cabaret, gypsy, folk, reggae, dub, and country and western. On the fair’s official website, organisers describe the festival as the ‘UK’s Maddest City’. In a review on another site, one fan wrote: ‘I want to be back in the land of Boomtown Fair, where drinking all day is encouraged, mechanical horses carry children through the crowds, the music is mad and the people are smiling.’ At last year's festival, an estimated £130,000 worth of drugs were seized by police, 121 people were dealt with for possession offences and 27 were arrested.","Young woman collapsed at Boomtown Fair festival in Hampshire .

For many they are a rite of passage – a first holiday away from home without the parents. But foreign exchange trips are on the wane, according to school leaders and education experts, with some schools even banning them. Parents fear for their children’s safety while they are abroad and are unenthusiastic about the time and effort involved in hosting someone else’s child for the return trip. Instead, pupils often swap letters with a child from a foreign country or chat via an internet video link on Skype. Cultural experience: Visiting a European country for a foreign exchange used to be a popular rite of passage for many schoolchildren . Dr Shirley Lawes, of the University of London’s Institute of Education, said: ‘These kinds of school exchanges were starting to diminish in the late 1990s. The 1996 rape and murder of British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson during a school trip in Brittany marked a watershed moment in attitudes.’ The modern foreign languages specialist added: ‘Paradoxically, her murder took place in a youth hostel, not a family home. But from around that time parents, in an unwarranted way, started getting concerned about their children going into a strange family.’ A rule introduced in 2009 forced host families to undergo criminal record checks despite no evidence of any visiting children ever being abused. It was swiftly overturned, but confidence in the system had already been damaged. Changing times: Students now chat with their foreign peers online instead . Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘There has been a cultural change, certainly in this country, and families are less willing to take someone into their own family. They would much prefer for the children to go on a trip without the hassle of looking after someone at the weekend.’ Some schools have responded by still taking pupils abroad but under the care of teachers instead of exchange families. Four local authorities in Wales are known to have banned home-stays. Children stay together in hostels and visit local families in pairs. But many teachers feel this approach limits the learning opportunites of the trip. Hilary French, president of the Girls’ School Association, said: ‘If a school takes a trip to a French chateau to do some activities, it is a step removed. You’re always with English people – you’re not really living in the culture.’ A fall in the number of children learning foreign languages at school – by 31 per cent between 1997 and 2011 also means there is less demand for schools to arrange trips abroad.","Language learning holidays on the wane - some schools even ban them .

He also stole about £800 from petty cash and £600 from a company loan . A 53-year-old father who stole £30,000 from his bosses to pay for his daughter's university course was jailed for 20 months today. Administration services manager Simeon Payne used invisible ink to forge cheques that his employers at the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors would sign. He faked the invoices so his employers thought they were paying a supplier. He would then erase the name of the payee and deposit the cheques into his own bank account. Mr Payne was caught when he attempted to cash £3,700 into a joint account that he held with his wife. Inquiries revealed that between 2007 and 2012, Mr Payne from Stockport, Manchester, wrote 35 cheques to steal nearly £29,000 from the company. He also stole about £800 from petty cash during that time and around £600 was stolen when he lied about paying off a £2,000 loan given to him by the organisation. He later blamed his behaviour on being 'in financial difficulty' because he needed to help to pay for his daughter's university fees and living expenses. Mr Payne pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of a position of trust and theft by an employee at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. Judge Maurice Greene told him: 'You were in a position of a high degree of trust and were responsible for accounts management and these offences were certainly planned with sophistication. 'It is a high degree of theft and it comes in the top category. It was essentially theft and it was a systematic and planned fraud over the course of five years. 'You have now lost your good name after all these years of having a good reputation. 'These are serious offences and are aggravated by the fact these were over five years. 'This was made worse by the considerable stress for your wife but you knew that over the years when you were taking money.' Mr Payne was arrested by police on 9 November 2012 after the bank alerted the CICES to a cheque which they thought was fraudulent. Mr Payne scanned in genuine supplier invoices and amended the dates and amounts before raising cheques to pay for them. He said he was 'remorseful' and wanted to reimburse his former employers. Simeon Payne stole from the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors by writing cheques with invisible ink . The court heard his wife suffered from depression for 12 years and a jail term would cause 'distress' to her and his elderly mother. But after the case PC Paul Taylor from Greater Manchester Police said: 'Payne abused his position in the organisation as an administration manager to steal money from them over several years. 'He was a trusted member of staff and he was expected to safeguard the financial interests of the organisation.

Move over Samuel Pepys, a new diarist has emerged on the scene whose epic work makes the great chronicler of the 17th century's look like hastily scribbled musings on a post-it note. Weighing half-a-tonne, comprising 151 volumes, covering 21,000 pages and totaling a a four million words, John Gadd is thought to have compiled the biggest personal diary ever seen in Britain. His tome also includes 33,000 . photographs, illustrations, cuttings from newspapers and everyday items . like wine labels and food wrappers, making it a real snapshot of one man's life. Chronicler: John Gadd is arguably the most prolific diarist in the world, with his record of four million words charting 38 years . Easy access: Despite weighing half a tonne, Mr Gadd says he can find any given entry in only three minutes . Labour of love: His work is fully illustrated with artwork, photographs and even food packaging . The 83-year-old first began writing it in 1947 and - . barring a two-week break every year to update the indexes - has added . his daily exploits to his labour of love. And each Christmas he sets aside two weeks to meticulously index that year’s diary - proudly claiming he can find anything within three minutes. His diary is now eight times the size of War and Peace, more than four-and-a-half times bigger than the complete works of Shakespeare and close to the total output of Dickens. It is three times bigger than Samuel Pepys work, which so vividly charted the Enlightenment period. Mr Gadd sees his work as a chronicle of life in and around the Dorset village of Fontmell Magna, where he lives with wife Barbara. He said: 'The volumes document everything. You name it, it’s in there. 'I write about whatever has captured my imagination during the day. I am just keeping a record in case no one else does and I’m a total obsessive with it. Review: Diary author John Gadd looks back on an entry he wrote some years ago . Fond memories: Fontmell Magna in Dorset, Dorset, which features prominently in John Gadd's diaries . Sporting: Mr Gadd writes passionately about another of his loves, Fontmell Magna Cricket Club . Nipper: Mr Gadd's diary has more than 33,000 photographs and pictures, including this one here of the man himself as a five-year-old . 'It would be a shame to look back in so many years time wishing we knew what had happened, or how something had happened. 'It settles family arguments too. My wife Barbara and I are always arguing about who we met, when we met them and how old they are. 'She has a wonderful memory and I have a very bad memory, but I have my diaries - although I have to say she is nearly always right. 'A lot of people are feature in the diary over the years and they often want to see what I say about them - I’m happy to report most of it is good. 'I can’t stop now, when you’ve kept it up as long as I have you need to keep going.' Dog lover: Mr Gadd's terriers also feature highly in the work, pictured here with one of his pets in 1988 . In clover: One of the international pig consultant's greatest achievements was when he appeared on the front cover of The Pig Farmer in 1980 . Jet setter: His job was to take him all the way around the world, all of which has been painstakingly documented . Mr Gadd started keeping his diary on a . whim in 1947 and filled it intermittently for many years until 1975, . when he began keeping a detailed daily event log. He records the minutiae of his daily routine, from the time he gets up to walking the dog and what he has eaten during the day. Mr . Gadd describes every village fete, the walks he took with his beloved . Yorkshire Terriers, and has amassed a vast collection of his favourite . wine labels over the years. Vintage: Another of Mr Gadd's loves is wine, and his diary contains many labels of bottles he has consumed . Taking the biscuit: Food wrappers, such as this Hob-nobs packet, provide a window to the past. Back then they cost just 63p . He has also recorded the daily events from his 33-year career as an international pig consultant which saw him make many trips abroad. Mr Gadd, who has one daughter, . Alison, has captured some of the biggest changes in history - including . the switch from vinyl to CD. One . extract on September 9, 1988 reads: 'The day of the LP black disc is . coming to an end, so they have been put away while they are available. Victory: Mr Gadd charted the street party in his village to celebrate VE day, left, and right, pages showing the Blandflord Floods of 1979-80 . Happy days: Pictures of Mr Gadd when he was a boy . 'In a years time they will be disappearing off the shelves and before long they will become collectors items as they clear out and the CD will take over.' He also documents his frustrations at the first postal strike in 17 years in 1988 and his pride at appearing on the front of ‘The Pig Farmer’ magazine. He described the birth of Fergie’s first baby on August 9, 1988: 'Fergie had her first baby last night, it will be fifth in succession to the throne. 'No name has been announced yet but the guesses are that it will be either Victoria, or Elizabeth, or both. 'J wants it to be Annabel so he can immediately call it Hannibal. 'Media have gone crazy over the birth, it’s boring me to hell.' The diaries also include plane tickets, mementos, and photographs of the numerous places he has visited over the years. Weighty tome: Some of the volumes stacked on shelves that have been amassed by the 83-year-old . He added: 'In past times many diarists had the time to sketch and paint to add interest to their record. In 1975 I thought I can at least take photos. 'A fortnight off is taken at Christmas every year to update two indexes - one for the text and one for the illustrations. 'After all, there is no point in squirreling away all that information in 22,000 pages if you can’t retrieve it, and I’m pleased to say any subject or illustration can be found within three minutes. Travel: Branding and tickets from a trip he took to the continent on a Sealink ferry . Pig consultant: His job was to take him all around the world and introduced him to many different cultures . 'I do it because it is fun and it is . also useful to show the changes in our village and over Dorset over more . than three decades, and to remind you how fickle memory can be. 'Sometimes . I write just one sentence, some times I have a rush of blood to the . head and I can write an essay or commentary or two or three thousand . words.' He added: 'To begin with the diary was quite hard work and pretty boring. But . after a few years I started being honest with myself and thought ‘what . the hell am I doing this for if I can’t tell the truth?’ 'It’s . amazing looking back how your opinions change over the years - and . sometimes you don’t like what you read from 30 years ago.'

All babies born in  Britain could have the EU flag stamped on their birth certificate within three years. Eric . Pickles said there was nothing he could do to prevent the emblem from . replacing the royal crest on birth, marriage and death certificates. The . Communities Secretary warned the move was part of a Brussels plot to . brand people as European citizens ‘from cradle to grave’. From cradle to grave: All British birth, death and marriage certificates will be stamped with EU flag from next year . He said the plan, contained in the . Lisbon Treaty, was part of an insidious campaign to stamp the EU flag . across all tiers of public administration and undermine nation states. His warning came after the EU unveiled new identikit blue-and- yellow certificates emblazoned with the 12-star flag. They will have legal force across the continent from early next year. For . now, these will be available alongside national certificates, so . parents will be able to ask for either a British certificate or a . European one. The idea is to make it easier for migrants to move around Europe. Brussels has not yet demanded that EU certificates become compulsory, but Mr Pickles said it was only a matter of time. Anti EU plan: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles called the move a 'Brussels plot' He used the example of driving licences, where at first it was optional for countries to put the 12-star EU symbol on new documents. Five years later it became mandatory, and in 2011 they were rebranded as ‘European driving licences’. The EU regulation on birth, marriage and death certificates is due to be reviewed in three years, and sources close to Mr Pickles said they feared it could become compulsory then. Because it is being implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, which was signed by the last Labour government without a referendum, such a move would not need the say-so of the British parliament. Moves towards standardised European . birth certificates will revive memories of the 1980s decision to . harmonise the design of passports across the EU. Britain . was forced to drop its popular black hardback design, and replace it . with a flimsier burgundy version. However, the UK was  at least allowed . to keep the royal crest on the front. Mr . Pickles said: ‘From cradle to grave, Britons are now to be stamped with . the EU flag, as Brussels starts interfering in people’s birth, death . and marriage. ‘This imposed . Euro-law is part of an aggressive propaganda campaign to bully councils . and public institutions into flying the EU flag at every opportunity.’ He added: ‘This EU stamp won’t be optional – just look at the Euro-creep of the EU flag ending up on every driving licence. ‘Eurocrats are brazen about their . political agenda to advance their “European project”, wipe nation states . off the map, and remove the Union Jack and our royal crest from public . life.’ In future years, the Commission also . has plans to widen the number of public documents available in European . form, including those relating to adoption, real estate and the absence . of a criminal record. Thrown out: A sample of a British birth certificate with the royal crest . New-born rules: As councils must issue the new documents from next year, all babies born in Britain could have the EU flag stamped on their birth certificate within three years . It . raises the prospect of Britons having to present an EU document to prove . they do not have a criminal record when they apply for a job. The birth certificates are part of new EU regulations which will come into force next year. Tradition: The Royal crest will no longer feature on UK certificates . Using powers granted by the Lisbon . Treaty, the Commission will order local councils, which administer . register offices, to offer birth, marriage, civil partnership and death . certificates with the EU flag at the top. The multilingual standardised forms are blue and yellow, and are topped with the EU flag. Languages on the form include German, French and Greek, but there are no national symbols. This means that, in Britain, there is no place for Her Majesty’s coat of arms. The European Commission has said openly that it wants to promote the idea of European citizenship, and even has a £265million  propaganda budget to support it. For example, 2013 has been branded the ‘European Year of Citizens’. Last night a spokesman for the Commission denied that the certificates would be mandatory. He said the idea was to make it easier for people who move to other EU countries and have to prove their identity. At present, the different languages on national certificates were causing problems for migrants, he said. He added: ‘It is plain wrong to suggest that the use of these certificates will become mandatory as the text of the proposal is absolutely clear that the certificates are an optional alternative but not in any way a replacement for national certificates.’","EU emblem to be stamped on all birth certificates within three years .

The reptile, called Bo, was described as ‘hungry’ and there were fears for the safety of family pets. Pet: . A snake (pictured) is on the run having escaped from a garden in . Rotherham, South Yorkshire and it hasn't been fed for two weeks . It hasn’t eaten for nearly a . fortnight and was due to be fed when it made its break for freedom.

Mrs Swann, 32, said Bo, who is . two-and-half-years-old, was basking in the family garden in Rotherham . when it escaped while they ate dinner. The family often leave the pet in the garden to warm up in the sunshine and say it normally ‘never goes anywhere’. They suspect the reptile slithered . out of their fully-fenced garden through a tight gap between  their . house and a neighbouring property. Bo was only left alone for . half-an-hour.

Upset: Corrine holds the skin from her snake Bo to illustrate how long she is . Mrs Swann, a former dinner lady, said her children were distraught. ‘We just want her back now, there has been a few tears from the girls. They love her to bits.’ Boa constrictors are not poisonous, . but their bite can be painful.

Mrs Swann’s husband, Damion, said Bo . is placid around the couple’s three young children and is ‘fine with my . five-year-old holding her’. Boa constrictors are nonpoisonous snakes found in the jungles of Central and South America.

Females incubate their eggs inside their bodies meaning they give birth can have up to 60 live babies. They are normally about 2ft long at both and continue growing throughout their lives. The largest ever boa measured 18ft (5.5m). Mr Swann said Bo, described as black and brown in colour, was generally not threatening but urged his neighbours to be on their guard.","Amazon jungle snake as big as a man is on the loose in Yorkshire .

A hard-up police force is considering closing some of its police stations and asking victims of crime to Skype officers instead in a bid to save money. Bedfordshire Police are under pressure to make £7.5m in financial savings following cutbacks in government funding. And the force's Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins has now said they unnecessarily spend £3m-a-year funding under-used police stations. Cost-cutting: Police in Bedfordshire are closing down local stations in a bid to save £7.5million (file photo) The Labour-affiliated PCC has now made the unpopular suggestion of axing some of its stations. Mr Martins says people could get in touch with police instead via the free internet video service Skype. A survey has now been sent out to homes across the county requesting families' views on the proposal. Mr Martins said: 'It's just an idea but we would presumably have a Skype address for the force control room or there might be scope for having it more locally based. Alternative: Victims of crime will be encouraged to report incidents via services such as Skype . 'We know we have got £7.5 million to save in the next two years and that police stations in total across the county cost us £3m a year. ""It is possible some smaller ones would be the ones to go just because the front desk is quiet - some of them barely have three or four people come in a day.

This is the dramatic moment a sailor had to be rescued from the sea after he was thrown from his powerboat which then started to circle him as he floated in the water. The man was flung from the boat near the coast of the Isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides after the steering mechanism jammed. A member of the Barra lifeboat took these pictures of the boat after the crew had managed to pull the man from the water on Wednesday. Out of control: The powerboat goes round in circles after the sailor was rescued because of the jammed steering mechanism . Rescue: The pictures were taken by a member of the lifeboat crew after they had rescued the man . The crew rescued the man after edging towards him while managing to stay clear of the motorboat. The team than managed to throw a rope around the boat to bring it under control by snagging the propeller. The man was then taken ashore by the lifeboat to Castlebay. Martin MacLeod, second Coxswain on the Barra lifeboat, said: 'The steering broke, the boat lurched violently to one side and the man who was wearing a survival suit was thrown over board. 'It’s a good job we were able to get to him as quickly as we did. 'A yacht had also come to assist but they were unable to lift him aboard because his dry suit had partially filled with water, making him very heavy. Operation: The crew managed to rescue the man from the water after edging towards him while staying clear of the out-of-control  motorboat . 'We pulled him out of the water with the help of the A-frame which is a custom built piece of equipment fitted to the lifeboat to retrieve casualties from the water.' The incident led the Marine Accident Investigation Branch to issue a warning for sailors to use a 'kill cord' which clips the driver to the boat’s engine cut-off cord - so they can deactivate the engine even if they fall out of the vessel. Stornoway Coastguard watch manager Carol Collins said: 'Fortunately the casualty was wearing a wetsuit, otherwise it may have been a different outcome, even after only a short time in the water. 'He was also at risk of serious injury from his own vessel which continued to circle him with the outboard engine running.'","Sailor was flung from the boat near the coast of the Isle of Barra .

A-levels in foreign languages should be made easier so that more students get top grades, the exams watchdog suggested yesterday. It said just one in 14 pupils received A*s in some modern languages, compared with one in six for maths. One solution would be altering the exam to make top marks more achievable, a spokesman admitted. ‘If there’s something about the design currently that’s preventing that [top grades] then it’s something we’d have to look at,’ he said. Too difficult: An exam watchdog has called for A-levels in foreign languages to be made easier to ensure that more students get top grades . The proposal is likely to be unpopular with Michael Gove, who is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust. End-of-course exams replacing bite-size tests on modular courses is one of the measures being introduced under the Education Secretary’s watch. Students will also be prevented from taking multiple resits to boost results. Concerns over foreign languages emerged in Ofqual’s corporate plan for 2013-2016, released the week before this year’s A-level results. Data shows 39.4 per cent of entries for French A-level last summer were awarded an A or above, with 6.8 per cent getting A*. In Spanish, 36.5 per cent got an A, with 6.8 per cent achieving an A*. In German the figures were 41.4 per cent and 7.9 per cent. Not a fan: The proposal is likely to be unpopular with Michael Gove, who is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust . But in maths, 43.9 per cent got at least an A and 17.4 per cent received an A*. In further maths, more than half were A-grade students and 28.6 per cent of those got the top grade. One in ten physics entrants got an A*, with 31.9 per cent getting at least an A. The Ofqual report said there were no plans to ‘recalibrate’ A-level standards when the new-style exams  are introduced from 2015. But it added: ‘There are two features of performance standards at present that we plan to address. ‘First, relatively few A* grades are awarded in modern foreign languages when compared with other subjects with a high proportion of A grades. Secondly, there are variations in the proportion of A* to A grades awarded at A-level each year in subjects. ‘We plan to evaluate ... and to make improvements so that standards are as comparable and consistent as possible.’ Experts said there were reasons for top grades being harder to come by in some subjects. Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘It is perfectly possible to get full marks in maths or further maths, provided you’ve got the talent. The questions are such that you are working for a  particular solution. ‘When it comes to foreign languages, there’s an element of interpretation. You can be very good and get an A but you may not have the fluency of a native speaker.’","Concerns over foreign languages emerged in Ofqual’s corporate plan for 2013-2016 .

He told workers they ‘may or may not . be directly impacted’ by the authority’s restructuring plans, adding: . ‘If you are involved I can fully appreciate the concerns you will have . and just ask for your patience.’ But his e-mail then started to echo . the character played by Ricky Gervais in The Office, when he gave miffed . workers a run down of his social life.

Union boss Kevan Nelson, Unison’s north west secretary, agreed the email was ‘inappropriate’. ‘It is a bit David Brent,’ Mr Nelson . said. ‘He probably meant it well but has underestimated the impact of . these changes on his staff. ‘I recognise there is a style of . management where you don’t want to appear overly-autocratic, but talking . about your plans when people’s livelihoods are in the balance is not a . good idea.’ In one episode of the popular BBC . comedy, Brent famously announced to staff they were being made redundant . by saying he had ‘good news and bad news’.

The boss of the Royal Mail has made a potential profit of nearly £400,000 in just 12 months on a luxury flat she bought with the help of taxpayers’ cash, it emerged last night. Moya Greene was controversially given £250,000 to help buy a home in London as part of a pay package to lure her from Canada. She put the money towards the 2012 purchase of a £1.6million maisonette located in one of the most expensive areas of the capital. Increasing value: The three-bedroom flat owned by Royal Mail CEO Moya Greene which has soared in value in just a year . The flat had been sumptuously refurbished by its former owner, a noted interior decorator, and was sold complete with art works and furnishings. But the area is so popular that Miss Greene’s three-bedroom home has rocketed in value to almost £2million in just a year, property experts say, giving her a potential profit of nearly £400,000. The £250,000 payment only emerged in the notes to Royal Mail accounts published last week and is to be repaid by Miss Greene, a divorced mother-of-one. Royal Mail claims the £250,000 payment ‘was not a gift’, describing it as a ‘single payment towards the purchase of a home’, approved when Miss Greene bought her flat with a mortgage from Barclays Bank. But there is growing political pressure for her also to return any profit she ends up making out of the deal. Under pressure: Moya Greene, CEO of Royal Mail, may make a £400,000 profit from the London flat she bought with the help of £250,000 of taxpayers' money . Business Secretary Vince Cable has already criticised the Royal Mail for giving the £250,000 in the first place. Mario Dunn, of the pressure group Save Our Royal Mail, said Miss Greene’s deal was ‘the kind of practice we associate with bankers’. He said: ‘Hard-pressed Royal Mail customers will not be pleased to learn they are paying for houses in London. ‘Unfortunately if Vince Cable goes ahead with privatisation there will be nothing that can stop this happening again in the future. ‘And consumers don’t want to have to pay more for their stamps to go toward higher pay, rewards and bonuses for senior executives.’ Miss Greene’s spokesman at the Royal Mail could not say how much of the profits she has made would be refunded and insisted that 59-year-old Miss Greene’s pay package – which last year totalled £1.5m – was ‘below the market average’. Miss Greene was previously boss of Canada Post, where she aroused huge opposition with her cutbacks including changing rules on staff sick leave benefits – earning herself the nickname ‘The Greene-ch’ who stole Christmas. Fine furnishings: Estate agent pictures show the living room in the flat occupied by Moya Greene in central London . State of the art: The galley kitchen in the flat helps increase the price . When she was brought to London in 2010 to prepare the Royal Mail for privatisation, she was given £127,000 in ‘relocation payments’, which included annual flights home to see her grown-up daughter. She initially rented a £5,000 a month terrace house in West London. But last year she decided to buy and settled on a sumptuous garden flat. Advertisements for the leasehold flat, set over the upper ground and lower ground floors of a handsome Victorian terrace, boasted about the ‘immaculate living space’ and ‘superb private garden’. The interior design meanwhile was described as being ‘luxurious and timeless’ including ‘state of the art modern lighting, audio visual and security facilities’. Labour’s shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna said: ‘The £250,000 housing perk the Royal Mail board gave its CEO – nearly ten times the average salary – will be totally unfathomable to its customers. Fine dining: When the flat was put on the market last year, the estate agents boasted about the 'immaculate living space' ‘The decision to award this housing assistance in the first place is surprising and calls into question the judgment of the Royal Mail’s board.’ A Royal Mail spokesman claimed Miss Greene was underpaid compared to other chief executives – even though her total package last year was £1.4million, with another ‘long term bonus’ of £500,000 due shortly. She also said the £250,000 housing payment ‘recognises that London is significantly more expensive than Canada’. The spokesman added that Miss Greene had ‘voluntarily offered’ to return the payment and said that a share of the profits she made on her flat would also be given back to the Royal Mail. The spokesman would not expand on the note in the accounts which said: ‘The Remuneration Committee will also determine the process for the reimbursement of the company of any unrealised gain to date associated with this payment.’ Last month the Daily Mail revealed that fellow Canadian Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England, was using his £250,000 a year housing allowance to rent a £15,000 a month six-bedroom townhouse worth £3million.","Moya Greene was given £250,000 of taxpayers' money towards a home .

But the researchers say it is ‘extremely unlikely’ they were exact contemporaries. Initial estimates for the male MRCA ranged from between 50,000 to 115,000 years ago. Geneticist Professor Carlos Bustamante, of Stanford University, California, said: 'Previous research has indicated the male most recent common ancestor (MRCA) lived much more recently than the female MRCA. But now our research shows there is no discrepancy.' Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are the two individuals who passed down a portion of their genomes to the vast expanse of humanity.

Siberia and Mexico. Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are the two individuals who passed down a portion of their genomes to the vast expanse of humanity.

The annual mutation rate was then estimated by comparing it with a known event, the human settlement of the Americas about 15,000 years ago . But despite the Adam and Eve monikers, which evoke a single couple whose children peopled the world, they were not the only man and woman alive at the time, or the only ones to have present day descendants. They simply had the good fortune to successfully pass on the Y chromosome and the mitochondrial genome across thousands of years to most of us. Powerful, state of the art microscopes allowed the identification of about 11,000 mutations, enabling the researchers to establish genetic links and timelines with unprecedented accuracy.

They repeated the analysis with the individuals’ mitochondrial DNA to generate the two estimates for Adam and Eve, showing for the first time they overlap. Professor Bustamante said: ‘We can now date certain events very precisely.

Some lineages die out, some are successful,’ said David Poznik, a graduate student in Prof Bustamante’s lab. ‘But it is also possible there may be elements of human demographic history that predispose these lineages to coalesce at certain times.’","'Y-chromosomal Adam’ is thought to have walked the Earth between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago .

Thousands of critically ill patients face longer journey times to hospital under controversial plans to close accident and emergency units, an official report has admitted. A third of all 999 ambulances will be delayed because of the closure of four emergency departments in North-West London, while pensioners and poorer people will be ‘disproportionately’ affected by the proposed changes, the report found. Campaigners and doctors fighting to keep the units open last night said that the review confirmed their fears that lives would be put at risk. Closures: Ealing Hospital's A&E department is one of four that will be closed in North-West London. A report shows it will take longer to get to hospital. Campaigners say lives will be put at risk as a result . A&E departments are set to go at . Ealing, Charing Cross, Hammersmith and Central Middlesex hospitals under . the Shaping A Healthier Future programme. It . will almost halve the number of emergency departments in the area – . from ten to six – which doctors say will leave remaining facilities . swamped. The Equality Impacts  -– Strategic Review found that: . ●  33 per cent of ‘blue light’ ambulances across the area will take longer to reach hospital.●  Among those picking up patients from poorer areas, 41 per cent will take longer.●  The four A&Es set to close are all in deprived parts of the capital.●  Elderly, poorer and disabled people who need non-urgent care will be ‘disproportionately’ affected.●  Seven in ten people travelling by bus or Tube will have journey times of 30 minutes or more. NHS managers paid global management consultancy Mott MacDonald to carry out the review. It was ordered to gauge whether the hospital ‘reconfiguration’ plan would make it more difficult for some patients. Under . the Equality Act 2010, public organisations are obliged to ensure they . are serving all equally, regardless of age, sex, race or sexual . orientation. The study also included social deprivation. The report warned that closures ‘will give rise to additional journey times’. It said hospital bosses should regard travel times as a ‘key concern’, . advising: ‘Some warnings do need to be raised about the prospect of . longer and more complex journey times.’ Closures could damage ‘continuity of care’, particularly for children. Well-developed . services at Ealing hospital to help Southall’s large South Asian . community, which  suffers high levels of poor health, would also be . lost. Julian Bell, leader . of Ealing Council, said last night: ‘This report confirms everything . that we have been saying right from the beginning about the dangers . posed to patients.’ Dangerous: The planned closures will halve the number of emergency departments in the area from ten to six. A review shows elderly and poor people will be the most affected because the four A&E units are all in deprived parts of London . The report’s authors believe no ambulances will take more than an extra ten minutes to reach an A&E after the closures, due to take place over the next three to five years. But Dr Onkar Sahota, chair of the London Assembly health committee, believed their calculations were wrong. And he added: ‘There is clear evidence that when travel times are increased, mortality rates go up.’ NHS bosses argue that closing the A&Es and replacing them with Urgent Care Centres will end up saving lives, because the remaining units will be better staffed, particularly at nights and weekends. They also say it is necessary to save money. A spokesman for the Shaping A Healthier Future programme said: ‘It is true that some groups will be affected more than others in terms of travel, but the advantages of getting much better treatment, at a better facility able to provide care specifically aimed at their communities, will far outweigh this. Delays: 41 per cent of ambulances picking patients up from deprived areas in the city will take longer because of the closures . The report has come to light days after a High Court judge ruled that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had acted unlawfully in choosing to downgrade another casualty unit. Mr Hunt had accepted an official’s recommendation to shut Lewisham A&E to help save neighbouring South London Hospitals NHS Trust from financial meltdown. Mr Justice Silber said both Mr Hunt and Matthew Kershaw, the special administrator, had acted outside their legal powers. Dr Sahota said A&E campaigners had been ‘heartened’ by the news.","Four emergency departments will be closed in North-West London .

The spending was uncovered by Channel 4's Dispatches 'How Councils Waste Your Money' and comes despite cash-strapped local authorities imposing deep cuts to social care and services. The investigation found: . Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles slammed the high spending at a time of deepening austerity. He said: 'I can pretty much tell you now that money spent on golf lessons by local authorities, or pedicures, is not wisely spent.' Not money well-spent: Eric Pickles MP has slammed spending on frivolous trips and luxury goods . The investigation found almost 200 councils currently own or lease chauffeur cars to ferry councillors and staff, with the bill for chauffeuring top brass hitting £30million over five years. It's the equivalent of the yearly salary of more than 1,300 new teachers, or 1,500 trainee social workers . Information, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed 246 chauffeur-driven cars in use across the UK's councils, including 52 Jaguars, 24 BMWs, 17 Mercedes, three Bentleys and a Rolls Royce. The biggest spender was Glasgow City Council, which forked out £983,000 on chauffeuring around its council chiefs and executives between 2007/08 and 2011/12. They currently use three £50,000 luxury Volkswagen Phateon saloons. Belfast City Council, which runs a plush BMW 7-series, spent £704,000, and Birmingham City Council, which runs three different Jaguar cars for its town hall chiefs, spent £663,000. The deprived area of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council racked up a £644,000 bill on chauffeur-driven cars, and runs a BMW 7 series, a BMW 5 series and a Volvo S80. While posh Kensington and Chelsea Council, in London, spent £602,000 on chauffeur-driven cars, which include a Bentley Continental and a Jaguar Sovereign. The investigation comes as town halls face fewer controls than ever before on how cash is spent. Councils in Britain are responsible for £114billion of taxpayers' money - more than the entire NHS budget, and twice the defence budget. But the Government has axed the Audit Commission, the independent body originally set up to ensure public money is spent wisely by local authorities. Instead, councils will be allowed to appoint their own auditors and police themselves. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: 'We're worried that if local authorities appoint their own auditor that we'll no longer have a real independent audit. Spendthrift: One council was found to be using credit cards to pay for manicures and pedicures, while another rewarded a member of staff with golf lessons . 'I think we will lose confidence that we're getting value for money for what we put in as council taxpayers.' Local government expert Professor Tony Travers, from the London School of Economics, warned the loss of the independent scrutiny body could lead to council waste. He said: 'We will see cases of misappropriation of money, and inappropriate behaviour.' The investigation also revealed councils lavished £3.7million on globe-trotting jaunts to a total of 90 different countries between 2007/08 and 2011/12. The biggest spender was Birmingham City Council which spent £319,000 over five years visiting a total of 43 countries including China, Bahrain, Jamaica, Brazil, and India. Belfast City Council spent £181,000 visiting countries including Israel, Italy, and the USA. While Midlands-based Coventry City Council spent £169,000 jetting to 21 countries including Australia, China, Japan, Spain, South Africa, and Sweden. The lavish spending includes money for twinning - where local authorities forge a relationship with a town or area abroad in the hope of boosting business and tourism. Kensington and Chelsea Council, in London, spent £602,000 on chauffeur-driven cars, which include a Bentley Continental . The investigation found coal-mining town Wigan spends around £25,000 each year to twin with Angers, a medieval town in the picturesque Loire Valley region of western France. It includes a £23,000 salary for an 'Ambassador' to Wigan . Councils also spent almost half a billion pounds on taxpayer-funded charge cards, which were used to buy golf lessons for staff members, football tickets, and pedicures. The charge cards, sometimes known as 'purchase cards' or 'P-cards' aim to increase efficiency and reduce costs of purchasing equipment for council offices and schools. But critics say they lack controls, and have led to extravagant spending. Investigators found Fenland District Council, in Cambridgeshire, spent £205 on golf lessons as a gift. York City Council spent £180 on pedicures and manicures which they said was for disadvantaged young people in a scheme focussing on building self-esteem. In the most shocking example, Lord Hanningfield, the disgraced former leader of Essex County Council, spent almost £300,000 on hospitality and travel with his council purchase card in five years. It included £136,000 on overseas trips to 24 countries, including £7,700 on a three-day conference to the Bahamas, and £2,000 to say at the five-star Taj Ma Hotel in India. The peer, who was jailed July 2011 for nine months after being found guilty of six charges of false accounting, but was released on an electric tag after serving just nine weeks, has defended the claims, saying his work helped save the council millions. Despite evidence of lavish spending, Mr Pickles defended the decision to axe the independent Audit Commission watchdog, saying it had started to 'lose its way'. Glasgow City Council - £983k .

He said: 'If Boots the chemist can appoint their own auditors, then I'm quite sure local authorities should be able to do it, provided they do not have the same auditor all the time. 'I think if you look around local government generally people have accepted this is what needs to be done.' Mr Pickles said increased openness in publishing council spending data would allow the public to keep a close eye on their councils, and ensure money is properly spent. He added: 'We've also been increasing the amount of transparency. Everything [spent] over £500 has not got to be produced and appear online. I'm hoping local authorities will go down to £250. 'Eventually I'm hoping they will publish everything they spend online. 'It shouldn't just be the district auditors taking an interest. The good running of local government should be a public priority.' And he encouraged the public to scrutinise their own local councils. He said: 'I suspect this programme might well be a catalyst and we will see 'mini-me' versions of this up and down the land. 'Ultimately you've got to trust the public.

A mushroom cloud rises above a row of skyscrapers in what looks like a devastating nuclear bomb blast. But thankfully this is just a spectacular weather-front blasting in from the tempestuous Rocky Mountains near Denver, Colorado. The unbelievable shot of the city skyline is just one of many dramatic images captured by local photographer Greg Thow. Jaw-dropping: The incredible mushroom-shaped cloud hanging over Denver looks like a nuclear explosion but is a weather-front blasting in from the Rocky Mountains . Somewhere over the rainbow: Photographer Greg Thow took the incredible images of the extraordinary weather over Denver . Mr Thow, 49, has also taken equally stunning shots of lightning blasts and arching rainbows - all from the comfort of his balcony. His work has become so well-known in his community that he often gets texts from neighbours and friends when a picturesque storm or view presents itself. He said: 'In the case of the cloud photograph, I was just minutes from home and I drove there quickly upon receiving a text message. 'Hundreds of photos had started appearing online that afternoon from cell phones around the city - but my vantage point put the skyline squarely in front as the cloud continued to grow in size. 'Thank goodness it wasn't a nuclear bomb as I'm not sure I would be around right now to tell you about it.' Glorious: A red sky rises over the Colorado city in one of the dramatic series of pictures taken from Greg Thow's balcony . Flash: The photographer is able to capture the images - such as these lightning strikes - because his neighbors give him tip-offs about interesting weather . He has been capturing the images from his roof deck for the past six months. His favourite is the huge rainbow, as he had to run home to take it and it 'would have disappeared' if he had been two minutes later. The dramatic shot of a bolt of lightning illuminating the downtown part of the city is another that the photographer savours. The mix of images is only possible because of Denver's broad weather system, which is influenced by its proximity to the Rocky Mountains and can range from blizzards to arid spells. One local phrase is: 'If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes.'

Content: Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted the reports would inform the debate on staying in the EU . A major government review into the Brussels influence in Britain has concluded there is little to worry about. William Hague's study into the so-called ‘balance of competences’ found that the current relationship between Britain and the EU was . broadly fine. But the claim provoked a damning response from Tory MPs and the UK Independence Party who dismissed it as 'a futile and cynical PR exercise'. The Prime Minister ordered the studies as part of his promise to re-negotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership. He plans to reach a new deal after the election before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. But the first six reports of 32 to emerge from the balance of competencies review suggest that there is little to complain about. Overall, more than 500 submissions were made to government during the consultation stage of the reports, which took up to eight months to draw up. One official said today: 'We are happy with the overall balance of evidence.' The report on tax said: ‘Respondents and interested parties were content with the current balance of competence on taxation.’ Another finds that integration has brought to the EU and the UK ‘appreciable economic benefits’ while a report on animal health for found that the ‘internal market produced real benefits for the UK’. Tory MP Douglas Carswell wrote on Twitter: ‘Europhile Whitehall elite says EU membership is a good thing – SHOCK.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'Problem number one is that the Conservative Party does not really want to repatriate important powers to the UK. Cameron has said he will vote to stay in the EU come what may. 'Problem number two is that their interlocutors in Brussels are unwilling to transfer powers as well.' However Foreign Secretary William Hague said the reports were an essential contribution to the debate on Britain's EU future. He added: ‘At a time when the EU is facing considerable challenges and discussion on the EU in Britain is intensifying, it is vitally important that the debate in the UK is as well-informed as possible,’ he said. ‘These reports make a valuable contribution, not only to the debate in this country but also to the debate taking place in other European nations about the future of the EU.’ Threat: One report warned that turmoil in member states could allow the EU's foreign service, headed by Baroness Ashton, could attempt to increase its control . The reports, drawn up by officials, do not make recommendations but attempt to summarise how the EU both helps and hinders the UK. The report on foreign affairs raises concerns about the performance of EU institutions such as the diplomatic service - the external action service headed by Baroness Ashton. ‘If the internal conditions of EU external action deteriorate, how will that affect our choices of how to deliver international impact in the British interest?’ the report asks. ‘If the institution's performance does not improve, or if there is an undesirable shift in control away from the member states, such as a greater role for the European Parliament, how will we alter our approach, what will the constraints be, and how will we use or develop our other partnerships and alliances as alternative vehicles?’ The report on health raised concerns about the impact of EU regulations - such as the working time directive (WTD) and data protection laws - on the NHS. ‘There was a strong view that it is important to consult more with health departments and their stakeholders on these areas from the outset. A number of concerns were raised about the negative impact of the WTD on the NHS,’ it said.","Government study finds on balance membership of the EU is a good thing .

Target: Mr Afridi has vowed not to remove his cherished moustache - despite death threats and kidnapping by Islamic extremists . Mr Afridi said: 'I don’t like smoking. I’m not fond of snuff, or drinking. This is the . only choice in my life. I’d even sacrifice food, but not the moustache. It’s my life. It’s not part of my life. It is my life. 'People give me a lot of respect. It’s my identity.' The moustache has been a passion of Mr Afridi's since he started growing it aged 22. He now spends 30 minutes a day . caressing and trimming the moustache. The costs of coconut oil and soap . used to maintain it comes to an eye-watering £100 a month. But despite the cost, the death threats, the constant fear of attack and having to spend long periods away from his family, it is all worth it, he insists. 'I feel happy.

Sliding across a rope, her face tight with concentration, the young woman looks as if she is on a rigorous bootcamp. In fact she is a tourist in Nabari, the birthplace of Japan's ninja, where visitors can pay for the pleasure of being taught in the ways of the ruthless feudal mercenaries. Scurrying over walls, throwing deadly spiked darts, and walking across water in special ninja shoes were all vital skills used by the warriors to revolt against their samurai overlords, though how much use they are to tourists in 2013 is another matter. Unusual holiday pursuit: A tourist concentrates as she slides across a rope in traditional ninja garb as part of a ninja training tour in Nabari, Mie prefecture, in Japan . Tourists who pay for the ninja training experience can learn how to throw shuriken - deadly darts which the warriors hid in their hands and used for slashing and stabbing . Nonetheless, such tricks are now being taught to enthusiastic visitors as Nabari, and its neighbouring town of Iga in Japan's Mie prefecture, use their ninja heritage to attract tourism and boost the local economy. Ninja were most prominent in Japan in the 15th century, covert agents who specialised in unorthodox warfare using espionage, infiltration, sabotage and assassination. Six centuries later, the warriors' skills are being used to boost the area's flagging economy.  Visitors to Nabari can buy a ninja training tour, which will teach them how to scale a 20ft wall, throw shuriken darts (concealed in the ninja' hand and used for stabbing or slashing) and cross rivers or ravines using ropes. Tourists who manage to get through the course unscathed receive graduation certificates, while those after a less exhausting insight into the traditional warriors can visit Iga, an hour down the road, and watch a ninja display to learn how they garrotted unsuspecting victims. Other attractions in Iga include an ancient shrine devoted to breaking up unhappy love matches, the beautiful white Iga Ueno Castle, and plenty of tourist shops offering traditional sweets and biscuits. Learn something new: The ninja training tour in the Japanese town of Nabari teaches participants how to climb a wall, and how to cross a river using special ninja shoes . True ninja experience, 21st century-style: Tourists change into dry clothes after praying under a waterfall during a ninja training tour in Nabari .

Visitors to the Japanese town of Iga in Mie prefecture pray at a shrine devoted to putting an end to unhappy relationships . Posters on a Japanese train advertise the ninja experience in Iga, left, while tourists who complete the training tour in Nabari receive a graduation certificate, right . Tourists are sized up for a ninja costume ahead of their training experience in Nabari, one of the homes of the deadly warriors who date back to the 15th century . Iga and Nabari are known as the home of ninja because the first ever ninja were trained in the area in the early 15th century.  The mountainous nature of the region may have helped boost the secretive image of the feared warriors, most of whom belonged to either the Iga or the Koga clan.  The men from Iga were particularly renowned for their fearlessness and deadly skills. Like the samurai, ninja were usually born into the profession, with youngsters picking up skills as they grew up.  As well as martial arts disciplines, young ninja learnt about survival and scouting techniques, about poisons, and how to administer first aid. They did not always work alone - sometimes they would work together to form a human platform to scale a high wall, or they would dress the same to cause confusion as to who committed a crime. Ninja were spiritual, believing not only in a personal power but also in the way of the Kami, a deity, and the Tengu, a race of birdlike spirits (half-man, half-eagle), said to inhabit forests in Japan. Spiritual: Ninja were spiritual and believed in various deities and powers, including the Tengu birdlike spirits, which they believed lived in forests . Part of the Nabari ninja training experience includes learning how to scale walls - this tourist is perhaps having a little more help than the average 15th century warrior . Not all rigorous training: Tourists can sample traditional Japanese sweets in the town of Iga, though the deadly shuriken dart is a reminder of the violent ninja past . Japanese shop owner and ninja descedant Genpo Murai shows photographs of his ancestor who performed as a ninja entertainer for groups of tourists years ago . Iga Ueno Castle, also known as Hakuho or the White Phoenix Castle, was built from 1585 with the tallest walls of any castle in Japan to prevent enemies scaling them - a record that still holds today .","Tourists pay to learn the ways of the traditional Japanese mercenaries in Nabari and Iga where ninja warriors began .

'They are caterpillars waiting to be turned into . butterflies. 'I want the people to know, including . the mothers, that they can have strength, they can have hope, and their . child will come back.' The balloons represented children who have been abducted but were never found, Michelle said, and carried with them the . simple message that 'there is hope for everyone'. The crowd who gathered at the house erupted into cheers as the crane came smashing down on the roof. DeJesus' aunt Peggy Arida was in the cab of the crane and took the first swing. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were not there. Michelle said organizers asked the families if someone wanted to begin the demolition and she agreed to do it, 'because I had so much anger inside me. I wanted to do it. It felt great. It felt like a house of horrors coming down'. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty said at a press conference outside the home: 'For ten years this house was a secret prison of a psychopath but after today it will be gone. 'He's going to sit in the bowels of prison now the rest of his life, the rest of his days, in fear himself of the other prisoners.' Officials will grind the House of Horrors to dust to make the place where unimaginable tortures took place completely disappear.

House of Horrors: The house on Seymour Street where Ariel Castro kept his victims for a decade is being torn down and ground to dust on Wednesday morning . The house was torn down as part of a plea deal that spared Castro from a possible death sentence. He had such an emotional attachment to the home that he broke down in tears when he had to sign over the property deed, ABC reports, saying it was wrong to tear it down because he had so many happy memories there. Castro’s family members were allowed to take approved personal items . from the home on Monday.  Workers emptied the house of furniture and . other belongings Tuesday. The girls - and the community - will decide what to put at the spot once it is torn down. The razing comes less than a week after Ariel Castro was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years, for holding Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry captive in his home on Cleveland's west side. A steady stream of on-lookers drove by the house before Cleveland police blocked off the street to traffic. The search giant Google had already . 'disappeared' the house on its Street View features since yesterday. Searches for the . address now show just a blurred box instead of the house. The city of Cleveland seized the home and . donated it to the Cuyahoga Land Bank, a non-profit organization that . fights urban blight in the city. The Land Bank has not revealed its plans for the property. Felix DeJesus said he and his wife and daughter Gina will watch the house come down. 'Thank God it will be over with. And tomorrow I will be there to see this house come down,' he told WOIO-TV. On . July 26, Castro - a former elementary school bus driver - pleaded . guilty to more than 900 counts of kidnapping, rape and assault and was . sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Google has blocked the Seymour Street house from its Street View feature. It is unknown whether the search giant did that on its own or if it was asked to make the house disappear . Defiant: Gina DeJesus (left) will be in attendance to watch the house be demolished, along with her parents Felix DeJesus and Nancy Ruiz (right) Ariel Castro has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty to more than 900 charges . Pictures emerged from inside the home of chains and restraints and makeshift alarms that he used to keep the young women bent to his sadistic will. Neighbors are happy to see the house torn down. 'I want things to be like it were, quiet and peaceful. But to see that house go down it really will be a relief because I am so sick and tired of looking at it,' Henrietta Bell told the Cleveland TV station. The land bank's president, Gus Frangos said that the organization is trying to keep away scavengers who might try to sell the rubble as what is known as 'murderabilia.' In 2011, a website that sells items related to high-profile crimes put on sale 1-gram packages of soil from the home of Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell before a city agency razed the house.

A forensic pathologist has told the inquest into the death . of Tom Maynard that a number of illicit drugs were discovered in the former Surrey batsman's hair and that he had regularly been using cocaine and MDMA. A jury returned a verdict of death by accident at the inquest today. Maynard, 23, was found dead on the railway line at Wimbledon, south-west London, . on the morning of June 18 last year after fleeing police who had tried to get . him to pull over in the nearby Wimbledon Park area while he was driving his . Mercedes. The cause of death was said to be electrocution caused by . stepping on a live line. The inquest was initially opened on June 22 and then . adjourned. Team-mates: Maynard's former Surrey colleagues Jade Dernbach and Rory Hamilton-Brown (below) arrive at the Tom Maynard inquest . Girlfriend: Carly Baker outside Westminster Coroner's Court . Forensic pathologist Dr Simon Poole all said old and new hair samples . showed consistent use of cocaine and MDMA in the three-and-a-half months before . death. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox described Mr Maynard's death as 'absolutely tragic' and called for analysis of hair samples to be considered for future drugs testing by Surrey County Cricket Club, and other sports clubs, to help identify drug users. 'I pass my sympathies to Mr Maynard's family for the loss they have suffered,' she added. At the time of his death Maynard was 'heavily intoxicated with alcohol'. His blood alcohol level was 214mg per 100ml, four times over the legal driving limit, which is up to 80mg per 100ml. The mix of alcohol and cocaine would have had a possibly significant impact on the former England Lions batsman's judgement. Police were in the Wimbledon area . looking for youths on mopeds suspected of trying to steal cars when they . saw Maynard in his black Mercedes. On the pitch: Maynard playing for Surrey last season . Tribute: Maynard is remembered in the pavilion at The Oval . The police thought it was a stolen car owing to its value and the fact it was being driven at around 4.15am, so they went to investigate. Police in an unmarked car blocked Maynard in a dead end and put on the blue light. One officer said the former Surrey batsman looked 'nervous and uneasy' and ran off. His BlackBerry was left in the car and the keys were still in the ignition. An officer chased him after he fled but she was unable to catch him and lost him, so returned to her colleague. Officers searched Maynard's car but found no drugs were found. Two other officers were called to the scene. Support: Carly Baker clasps hands with another woman before the inquest . Maynard's former Surrey team-mate Jade Dernbach told the inquest he was unaware that the batsman was using cocaine or any other drug and that he was not known as a drug user among the other players. He added that in some years players can be tested 'eight or nine times, in other years once or twice'. Dernbach added that on June 17, the night before the tragedy, he, Maynard and Rory Hamilton-Brown had gone for a 'few beers'. The trio then went to Ship Inn in Wandsworth, south-west London, at about 9pm. Dernbach says he had approximately four beers and a couple of shots. He was not aware that Maynard was taking any drugs. They then went back to the house shared by Maynard and Hamilton-Brown to drink some more before going to Aura nightclub at around midnight. When they returned, Dernbach went upstairs to bed before Maynard left the house. Dernbach also gave details of how Maynard was hit by a car in Brighton when drunk 10 days before his death. Maynard was disciplined by Surrey following that incident. Ability: Maynard had played for the England Lions . Hamilton-Brown also said he did not see Maynard take drugs, describing his former team-mate as 'one of my best friends'. He added: 'I was jealous of his ability to celebrate highs and lows and stay level. 'I'd describe him as an incredibly level guy with so much talent in all facets of life.' Maynard's girlfriend, Carly Baker, . who wept throughout the hearing on Tuesday, said she had spoken to her . boyfriend at 3.30am: 'He sounded very down and depressed on the phone. 'For me to say ""What's wrong"" is quite unusual. It was like he needed me. 'He said, ""You're the only thing that makes me happy"", and he said it three times.' Miss Baker added that she urged Maynard not to drive to her home as she suspected he had been drinking. Statement: Tom Maynard's father Matthew (left) and his family said 'the results of the inquest will not define our son' Through the Professional Cricketers' Association, the Maynard family made a statement, saying: 'The results . of the inquest do not define our son. The fact that so very many people . thought the world of him is what defines him as a person. 'The only people who would judge Tom . on the findings of the inquest are people who didn't know him. He made . choices that night that tragically cost him his life but his devastated . family and friends will love and miss him unconditionally always. 'He was a very special person and his death leaves a huge hole in all our lives.' The PCA added that it was, 'saddened by the information which has come to light from the inquest into Tom Maynard’s death, and confirms both its support for Tom’s family, friends and team-mates at this difficult time.' It also said: 'Cricket has a comprehensive anti-doping programme, which has been in place for a number of years. 'Whilst the focus of this programme is . primarily on performance-enhancing drugs, it does include in-competition . testing for recreational drugs. 'The very rare incidence of positive . results suggests that cricket has no more of a problem in this regard . than society as a whole. 'The PCA is supporting the ECB in its examination of the feasibility of out-of-competition testing for recreational drugs. 'It confirms its support for such an . initiative as long as it is linked to appropriate arrangements for . treatment and rehabilitation in the event of a positive test.' Minute's silence: England and West Indies players remember Tom Maynard before their ODI at The Oval last summer . Following Maynard's death Surrey conducted a review which found: 'Players in leadership positions must always set the very best example, both on and off the pitch. 'Players considered high risk must receive constant guidance; with a development plan that must be adhered to if they are to remain with the Club. Coaches and staff require additional and regular training in order to spot the symptoms of alcohol and drugs use. 'The Club should work harder to create an environment where players in trouble come to us first, so we can help them resolve situations properly and quickly. Other external influences may not always be positive. 'We should initiate a formal process to identify key performance behaviours with full cooperation from all squad members and coaching staff. This will include the adoption of an alcohol and drugs policy which will be applicable to all. 'Surrey CCC will seek to gain the support of players, the England and Wales Cricket Board and Professional Cricketers Association in order to protect players through a drugs policy which includes a more comprehensive social drug testing programme.' Walking in: Jade Dernbach (left), Gareth Batty (centre) and PCA Chief Executive Angus Porter arrive at the Westminster inquest . A joint ECB and Surrey statement said: 'In the light of today’s verdict, ECB and Surrey CCC would like to re-iterate that this incident was a terrible human tragedy and again extend our condolences to the Maynard family and to Tom Maynard’s many friends and colleagues within the professional game. 'While the ECB accepts that recreational drug use is a part of modern society, we do not condone it and will take all reasonable steps to prevent its use within the game. We also believe we have a responsibility to educate all our players and are committed to supporting any player who needs help in this area. 'Surrey CCC began its own investigations into conduct at the end of last season and introduced a team-wide anti-drug policy which all players and management are required to abide by. Working in partnership with ECB and PCA further recommendations have been initiated. 'The ECB Board has recently agreed to develop an out-of-competition testing programme to encompass recreational drugs, in co-operation with the PCA. 'These measures will supplement ECB’s existing anti-doping programme which involves in- and out-of-competition testing through UK Anti-Doping in compliance with the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code and financial support which ECB provides to PCA for player education and support programmes. Car: Maynard's Mercedes, which was abandoned near Wimbledon Park Tube station . 'The ECB’s testing programme applies . to all registered County players and up to 200 tests are carried out on . average each year. This approximates to around 35-40 per cent of the . overall number of registered professional players. Last year, one player . (Abdur Rehman of Somerset) tested positive for cannabis following an . in-competition test. 'England players are tested in . addition as part of the ICC’s own anti-doping programme for all . international cricketers which are also WADA compliant. To date, no . England player has tested positive under these programmes. 'ECB and Surrey CCC would like to end . by echoing the statement issued by the Maynard family earlier today. The results of this inquest do not define Tom Maynard or alter in any . way the tragedy of his passing. Tom was a great man and a great . cricketer and will be remembered forever by everyone who had the . privilege to know him.' England one-day batsman Luke Wright . tweeted: 'All people need to know about Tom Maynard is that he was one . of the best and kind people you could ever meet. Miss him! Xx'.

Two seven-year-old sisters are facing life as the only twins in Britain with one of the world’s rarest genetic disorders. Hannah and Katie Beck suffer from Alstrom syndrome, a progressive condition that affects every organ in the body, and has just 60 known sufferers in the UK, and 800 worldwide. Often the first symptoms of Alstron syndrome are eye problems which lead to, as in the little girls' case, early-onset blindness. Hannah (left) and Katie (right) Beck suffer from Alstrom syndrome which means they are living on borrowed time and are unlikely to live beyond their 20s. There are only 60 known sufferers in the UK . Hannah and Katie, who were diagnosed when they were four, are also slowly losing their hearing. The girls have to wear dark glasses throughout the day because their eyes are intensely sensitive to light and they are being trained to use white canes and Braille. They both attend a mainstream primary school where they get special one-to-one teaching to help them live as normally as possible. Their parents Julie, 41, and Ian, 44, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, both carry the Alstrom syndrome gene but are unaffected themselves. Alstrom syndrome is a rare, recessively inherited genetic disorder. The first symptoms it causes are eye and heart problems - including heart failure and an intense dislike of bright light. Hannah and Katie (pictured with their mother, Julie), were diagnosed when they were four-years-old and are slowly losing their sight and their hearing . Most children with the condition eventually end up with severe sight loss. The condition also causes sufferers to gain weight quickly, even if they have a healthy diet. A large percentage of children with the condition also develop type two diabetes. Children with Alstrom syndrome tend to develop hearing problems and often become incontinent. The condition can also cause problems with the liver, kidneys and bowel.

I’m proud of their determination and their wish to be independent. ‘They also have a fantastic bond, like all twins really, but I think they have a bit of a sixth sense about when the other really needs them. ‘Ultimately they really lean on each other and spur each other on, and I’m glad they have each other for that support.’ Mrs Beck, a primary school teacher, told how experts had struggled to identify what the girls were suffering from. They saw numerous experts including a paediatrician, a dietician, eye doctors, a special educational needs coordinator and speech therapist before being referred to a geneticist. She said: ‘We went along and the expert mentioned Alstrom briefly which we had never heard of.

We read it is incurable and children with it don’t have a long life. It is a very complex condition which affects every organ in the body. ‘We looked at the list of symptoms the girls had and they ticked most of the criteria between them. ‘We didn’t really need the genetic test as we knew in our hearts that they had it. ‘We got the call back for Hannah’s positive result for Alstrom three days before Christmas that year. ‘We . were hoping and praying it wasn’t going to be a positive result for .

'This DVD is so important as it will be sent out to doctors to raise awareness of Alstrom,' said Mrs Beck who is also a trustee of the charity ASUK which is attempting to raise £1m for research into the condition. 'It is so rare that doctors just don’t know about Alstrom. We hope the DVD will lead to better understanding of the condition and quicker diagnosis.

Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump said Vargas succumbed to his injuries Thursday about an hour after the 4am shooting. Scroll down for video . Jorge Vargas, a 27-year-old married father of a little boy, was shot to death while he worked on his truck in his jailer's uniform Thursday morning . Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed 'America's Toughest Sheriff,' shows off the 400 Smith & Wesson AR-15 assault rifles he bought for his department . Vargas, an eight-year veteran of the jail, was apparently getting ready to go to work and working on his truck when someone shot him in his driveway. Officers searched on foot and by helicopter for the shooter, who is believed to have been seen fleeing the neighborhood on foot. By Thursday night, the shooter still remained at large. Arizona authorities have no suspects or a motive but are investigating whether the shooting was connected to Vargas' job as a jail detention officer. At a news conference on Thursday evening, Arpaio - a controversial figure in Phoenix - conceded that it was possible that Vargas was targeted because of his work. Perhaps to underscore the point - though not directly related to Vargas' murder - Arpaio announced he would handing out 400 Smith & Wesson AR-15 semi-aromatic rifles to his deputies. He said the rifles will ensure his officers are safe when faced with increasingly more powerful weapons in the hands of criminals. He says he purchased the weapons with money seized during arrests. Deadly: A detention officer with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona was shot dead in his driveway as he was getting ready to go to work . Manhunt: Police blocked off the area around the victim's home near 912st Avenue and Durango Street and launched a search for the gunman . The sheriff also announced Thursday that each of his patrol deputies must carry a firearm with them at all times to be able to combat crime even when they aren't on duty. Arpaio says 'we live in a violent society,' and he wants his officers to have 'enough firepower to fight back.' The new weapons and the new rules would not apply to jail officers like Vargas. In the shooting of Vargas, multiple gunshots rang out outside the Phoenix home of the Maricopa County detention officer at around 4am. Neighbors rushed to the scene, only to find the officer lying next to his pickup truck near 912st Avenue and Durango Street. No one else was home at the time of the shooting, the station KPHO reported. Beautiful family: Vargas is pictured here with his wife and son. He was an eight-year veteran of the sheriff's office . Authorities are looking into the possibility that Vargas' murder was related to his job in the detention center . According to eyewitnesses, a Hispanic man in his 20s wearing a white T-shirt and black shorts was seen fleeing from the crime scene. The mortally wounded jail employee was rushed to St Joseph’s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later. According to investigators, the officer was partially dressed in his uniform and was apparently getting ready to go to work at the time of the shooting. Officers who responded to the scene blocked off the area around the victim’s house and launched a search for the gunman. They stopped several vehicles and questioned a number of people, but no arrests have been made.","Jorge Vargas, 27, is a married father of a little boy .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 11:57 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:36 EST, 8 August 2013 . Eliot Spitzer has revealed that he was paid more than a million dollars by CNN after his news show was cancelled by the cable network. The pricey pay-out was only confirmed on Thursday after Spitzer succumbed to pressure from his opponent in the New York City comptroller's race to release his tax returns. The latest move still didn't satisfy all . critics, however, as he did not make his tax returns from 2011 and 2012 . public, instead allowing one New York Times reporter to go over to his office and look through them while Spitzer was at his side. Opening up (somewhat): Eliot Spitzer has revealed how he made millions since resigning from office in 2008, including a massive salary from CNN, a salary from his parents real estate company and book royalties . Though he resigned from office in 2008 after he was caught meeting with prostitutes, the years since leaving the governor's mansion have been profitable ones for the Spitzers. Spitzer and his wife Silda are living . separately, though they still file their financial documents jointly . meaning that they have not legally split up. In 2012, Eliot and Silda made a combined $4.27million as she earned six-figure sums from her salary while he brought in paychecks from a variety of different sources. Silda earned $125,325 in 2012 from her work at a private equity firm though that was a nearly 50 per cent pay cut from her earlier job. She earned around $250,000 while working at a hedge fund in 2011. Meanwhile, Eliot receives a $180,000 annual salary from his work with his father's high-end real estate company. Joining in: The tax returns show that Silda, seen here entering Spitzer's office building on Wednesday, is living apart from her husband but they are still filing joint tax returns . Since that lowpoint: Spitzer resigned from governor in 2008 and has had a number of sources of income ever since . He also brought home $10,000 from his teaching work at the City University of New York in 2011 and less than half that in 2012. Sales from his books, speaking fees and consulting work produced a combined $50,000 in 2012. All of that work marks only a fraction of his total income, with CNN's hefty payout marking the vast majority of his earnings. Spitzer co-headlines a show on the cable news network that was cancelled in 2011 after only 10 months on the air. Between 2011 and 2012, he was paid $2million from the channel, over $1million of which came after the show stopped airing. Spitzer's reluctance to release the full details of his family's financial dealings comes in contrast to his previous stance on the issue, as the disgraced former Democratic governor criticized Mitt Romney for failing to reveal his tax returns during the 2012 presidential election. Given that, Spitzer may also be embarrassed by the fact that his charitable giving- he and Silda gave $154,925 to charitable causes during the two-year-time period- is paltry compared to that of his former target. On the trail: Spitzer's main opponent publicly released five years of tax returns, and repeatedly called on the former governor to do the same but he only ended up showing one reporter two years of returns . Politico reported during the election that Mitt and Ann Romney gave 29.4 per cent of their income away (which added up to $4,020,772 in charitable donations) as compared to the Spitzer's 3.6 per cent. The New York Times also describes cost source as his 'modest' household help, as he spent $60,000 for their unspecified number of household employees. Spitzer's rival released a full five years of returns while Spitzer only showed The Times reporter two years' worth. If Spitzer released five years, that would include . 'It’s unfortunate that it took an entire month of public pressure to force Eliot to release two years of his tax returns, and notable that he still refuses to release the remaining three years,' said Audrey Gelman, the spokeswoman for Stringer.","Disgraced former governor now running to be the next comptroller of New York City and showed a reporter his tax returns for the past two years .

The after-school activities being chosen by parents say a lot more than you might think about the future they envision for their daughters. When choosing activities for elementary school girls, families believe choosing either chess, dance or soccer puts their daughters on specific paths for future success, with each lending itself to traits prized by different segments of the population, according to a recent study. This finding was the result of interviews conducted with 38 families over a 16-month period, the families were a subset of the over 200 families interviewed for the book Playing to Win: Raising Children in a Competitive Culture. Future executive: Soccer is seen by upper-class parents as providing their daughters a path to the corner office . In setting out to define how children’s activities are associated with their feminine or masculine identity, author Hilary Levey Friedman interviewed 200 families on what  after-school activities their children take part in and how parents feel that puts the wheels in motion for a more successful future. In post on The Atlantic’s website, she chose to focus on the segment of families with elementary school-aged girls. Friedman’s findings, based on the girls’ parents’ own words, placed these young girls into three categories – ‘aggressive,’ ‘graceful’ and ‘pink,’ which she said defined the girls’ ‘gender scripts.’ She questioned the 38 families across three urban settings and three rural settings. Aggressive girls, as defined by their . parents, tended to be steered into soccer, according to Friedman. Soccer . moms tended to come from upper-class families with white collar jobs . ranging from doctors to investment bankers and lawyers, Friedman noted. ‘Aggressive girls are taught to be both physically and competitively forceful, actively subsuming aspects of their femininity,’ wrote Friedman. These girls are encouraged to de-emphasize physical femininity and cultivate a winning attitude – to prepare them for future executive positions. ‘I encourage her to be more aggressive because she's a cute little girl, but I don't like her to be a girly girl,’ one father said to Friedman, adding ‘you know, I don't want her to be a cheerleader--nothing against that, but I want her to prepare to have the option, if she wants to be an executive in a company, that she can play on that turf.’ Being overly feminine is seen as being a disadvantage by this parent, who worried his daughter would become a secretary if she was too much of a ‘girly girl.’ Give me an N! Give me an O!: Upper class parents feel that cheerleading, while okay, makes their daughters more likely to be an executive assistant than an executive, according to Hilary Levey Friedman . Grace and etiquette: Young girls participating in competitive dance are more likely to be considered graceful and polite, which makes them moe desirable mates, according to their parents . Not nearly as focused on their daughters’ careers as their more well-to-do counterparts, lower-class parents . encouraged their girls to enrol in competitive dance – which . specifically emphasizes feminine qualities such as grace and etiquette. Dance competitions tend to have very supportive atmospheres, parents told Friedman. In addition to the focus placed on appearance – hair, makeup, cleanliness – the girls are encouraged to find at least one way to encourage or compliment their competitors.  These situations prepare girls for futures in ways upper-class parents shun. Grace and etiquette are equated with femininity, which blue collar parents tend to feel makes their daughters more desirable and likely to be married. Marriage and family are seen as more important to lower-class families Friedman spoke to, as opposed to the corner office often prized by the upper class. The one activity seen by parents to . embrace both the competitive, warrior-like nature of soccer, and the . femininity of competitive dance was scholastic chess. Even more . importantly some parents told Friedman, ‘they beat boys.’ Pink warriors: Young girls learn more about equality playing scholastic chess, they also even learn they can beat boys . Susan . Polger, the female chess grandmaster, told Levin that chess not being . physical is the point, that equality can be achieved in many ways. ‘I think girls need to understand that, yes, they have equal potential to boys. I think that chess is a wonderful tool as an intellectual activity, where girls can prove that unlike in physical sports, because by nature maybe boys are stronger or faster, in chess women can prove equal.’ These activities, Friedman wrote, are symbolic of what parents want for their children. From maintaining upper-class social status to preparing one’s self for being a good wife, after-school activities matter. ‘Gender and class are being reproduced in these competitive activities, which will likely impact who ends up in that corner office and who ends up as the boss's assistant,’ Friedman wrote. That is, unless you’re the father of one boy beaten by a ‘pink warrior.’ ‘A chess mom described [to Friedman] how a father reacted negatively when his son lost to her daughter: ""The father came out and was shocked. He said, 'You let a girl beat you!'","Findings are revealed in new book Playing to Win: Raising Children in a Competitive Culture .

"By . Chris Hanlon . PUBLISHED: . 08:34 EST, 29 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:08 EST, 29 March 2012 . The long dispute over the estate of socialite philanthropist Brooke Astor has ended with a settlement that frees $100 million for charities - and cuts by half the amount going to the son convicted of conning her. The agreement among Astor's descendants and the New York institutions she loved ended a five-year legal fight that the judge feared would consume the entire estate - like in Dickens' Bleak House. Westchester County Surrogate Judge Anthony Scarpino signed the agreement yesterday before State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the details. Astor died in 2007 at the age of 105. Family feud: Anthony Marshall before sentencing in 2009 for conning mother (right) Schneiderman said the settlement benefits several institutions, principally the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library and New York City's public schools. He said it cuts by more than half - to $14.5 million - the amount going to Astor's son, Anthony Marshall, who at the age of 85 was sentenced to one to three years in prison for siphoning millions from her before she died. However, Marshall appealed his conviction and sentence and has been stayed out of jail awaiting appeal. Stately home: An auction in September is to be held by Sotheby's at the Astor mansion in Westchester . Riches: The staircase at Brooke Astor's Westchester estate, Holly Hill, lined with . the paintings of the late socialite's favourite animal is part of the estate . Astor was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2000, and prosecutors said Marshall exploited her to pluck artwork off her walls, award himself a more than $1million raise for managing her money and persuade her to change her will to reward him at the expense of charities. Marshall and the charities had disagreed on which of several wills and revisions expressed Astor's true intent. That case shocked New York, where Astor was a popular woman-about-town well into her 90s. Other charities benefiting from the settlement include Central Park and Prospect Park in New York, the Bronx Zoo, Historic Hudson Valley, Carnegie Hall, New York University, Rockefeller University, the Pierpont Morgan Library, the city's Animal Medical Center and Trinity Episcopal Church. The attorney general's office stepped into the case to protect the charities, and Schneiderman said he was happy that the agreement 'honors Mrs Astor's final wishes and benefits New York's landmark educational and cultural institutions.' Anthony Marx, president of the Public Library, said the settlement means Astor's legacy 'can continue as she intended.' Thomas Campbell, director and CEO of the Met, also said Astor's intentions had been honored. Antique chic: Mrs Astor's ornaments and decorative accents like these Chinese lamps and George III mirror date back hundreds of years and were purchased in different parts of the world . Waddell Stillman, president of Historic Hudson Valley, called the settlement amazing and said it 'avoids costly litigation that would have depleted Mrs Astor's estate' Scarpino said in 2007, at a court session involving 15 lawyers, that he feared the attorneys 'will be happy to litigate this matter to the very end of this stream of money that's there.' That brought comparisons to Bleak House, in which a large inheritance led to a case that persisted for generations. By the time it was settled, almost nothing was left for the descendants. In the Astor case, three descendants who were minors when the case began have turned 18 in the meanwhile. Anthony Marshall's son, Philip, who opposed his father in court, is another beneficiary. Anthony Marshall's lawyer, Ken Warner, said he was pleased that the settlement had been reached. 'He is almost 88-years-old, and much prefers closure to an expensive and protracted litigation over his mother's estate,' Warner said. Empire state of mind: Mrs Astor's New York apartment . The settlement does not detail the current size of the estate, but in 2007 it was estimated at $198 million. It also does not specify how much each party is receiving, but Schneiderman said it establishes a $30 million Brooke Astor Fund for New York City education. Under the 2002 will that forms the basis for the settlement, the Met and the Public Library were to get 25 per cent each of the amount going to charity. The Metropolitan Museum of Art released a statement saying they were 'deeply gratified' the charitable intentions of the late Astor have been honored. 'Under this settlement, the Museum will receive approximately $20million from the estate, which will be used to support the institution's curatorial programs and art acquisitions, as Mrs. Astor wished,' the statement continued. Codicils that would have given millions more to Anthony Marshall at the expense of Astor's charities were ignored. Astor donated millions to the arts and the poor after the 1959 death of her husband, Vincent Astor, heir to a fortune generated in real estate and the fur trade by his great-great-grandfather, John Jacob Astor. While Brooke Astor's estate was substantial, it was dwarfed by some others. Leona Helmsley, the real estate queen who died the same year, left more than $4billion to charity. Astor's estate may soon be worth a little more, however. Some of her designer jewelry, furniture and decorative arts are being auctioned in September at Sotheby's. Her Westchester estate was recently sold for $6.4million.","Son, who was 85 when convicted of swindling mother while she had Alzheimer's, to lose most of his inheritance .

'No more worries': Paul White, left, holds his winning Powerball check for a $149.4 million chunk of this week's $448 million jackpot, one of the biggest in history. Also on hand was his ecstatic partner Kim VanRees, at center . Lucky shop: This is the supermarket in Ocean County, New Jersey, where a winning lottery ticket was sold to a pool of 16 county government workers . The third ticket to match the winning numbers was sold in South Brunswick, New Jersey, at this Stop & Shop . The Asbury Park Press reports that members of the Ocean County Vehicle Maintenance Department in Toms River bought their tickets at the local Acme supermarket. None of the employees have yet come forward, but Freeholder Director John P. Kelly told the newspaper that he is happy that they won - even if he might have to hire an entire new crew of mechanics. 'We are thrilled. We consider county government a family,' he said. 'It’s good to see these hard-working, blue-collar employees win this money that’s really going to be a life-changer for them.' Split 16 ways, the lump sum comes to about $5.4million per person after taxes. Mr White, the divorced Minnesota father, has a chance to keep his portion of the winnings to himself. Purchases in mind: White, a divorced father of a 16-year-old son said he plans to help out his parents and buy his son the car of his dreams . ‘It's crazy,’ said the 45-year-old. ‘I’ve gone through this in my mind so many times.

The . divorced dad made no mention of his ex-wife, nor has the mother of his . son and daughter come forward with her own feelings about her ex's win. While . White's new partner VanRees appeared overjoyed, his boss Ron Bowen was . also on hand and White joked he 'is going to end the day as my . chauffeur.' White told reporters he intends to pursue charitable endeavors, help out his parents, and buy his son the car of his dreams. As . surprised as he was with the huge news he is a newly crowned . millionaire, White said he always had a hunch he'd be a winner one day. The father of two teens said he played the lottery around once a month or when the the jackpot was especially big, though he said he was always 'more of a scratch-off guy.' He also said he nearly forgot to get tickets this week. Lucky for him, he remembered and bought $10 worth. White said he checked the 10 tickets he bought and realized he had nailed all six numbers on one of them. The ensuing hours, he said, had been a blur. Lump sum: Before taxes, White's share of the $448 million jackpot is $149.9 million. He took a lump cash sum and will get $86 million before taxes, or $58.3 million after taxes . 'It's just surreal at this point. I don't think you guys can understand — it's crazy. No worries anymore. It's crazy,' he said. He specified that no longer worrying about paying to send his 16-year-old and 14-year-old children to college or for his family's medical needs. He also said he intends to buy several cars: a 1963 Chevy Impala for his 80-year-old dad, a car for his newly licensed 16-year-old son, and a rare 1991 Acura sportscar for himself. White said he worked for a Minneapolis electrical contractor that had worked on major projects around the area including the Twins' Target Field and the University of Minnesota's TCF Bank Stadium. He said he's help his company finish a few things up, but that after that his working days would be over. 'I think a lot of good things are going to come out of this for not only my family and friends but for random people,' he said. 'I don't want to work for anybody else for the rest of my life for a paycheck.' Three winners: One of the two other tickets was sold at this Stop & Shop in South Brunswick, New Jersey. Winning numbers for one of the largest Powerball jackpots ever were: 05, 25, 30, 58, 59 and Powerball 32 . White said he intends to stay in his small Minnesota town, though. 'We’ll stay in that area, maybe just not in the same house,' he said. The other two winning tickets were . sold in New Jersey, including at a store in Little Egg Harbor, which is . still recovering from the damage wrought by Superstorm Sandy, which made . landfall just a few miles away. 'Hopefully, . it's somebody who lives in the area, and this is their reward for . having gone through this,' said Carol Blackford, a retiree whose home in . Little Egg Harbor was flooded with knee-high water during last . October's storm. 'And if they want to share, we're here.' But even if the winner wasn't someone devastated by the storm, the community will benefit from the jackpot.

David Cameron has pledged to stage an in-out referendum by 2017 if he is Prime Minister after the next election. The Tory leader wants to renegotiate a fresh settlement, returning some powers to London, and has indicated he would campaign to stay in the EU. Polls suggest the result could be close, but with a small majority preferring to remain not to leave. If that was the result in four years’ time, Mr Farage suggested he would walk away from politics. He said: ‘For the overall cause, no free country ever willingly gives up the right to govern itself and the independence argument won't die but it will have been put back for a long time. ‘Personally, I would have probably reached the end of the road. If we reach that point in 2017, I will have been doing this a long time and if I haven't succeeded then I haven't succeeded,’ he told Public Service Europe. However Mr Farage insisted the debate in the run up to the referendum would see an increase in support for leaving the EU. ‘I genuinely think that a referendum on this subject would be just like the debate on whether we should join the euro. ‘The more air and the more publicity it gets, the more likely it would be that our side of the argument would win.’ Mr Farage first became leader of UKIP in 2006, but quit in 2009 to stand for Parliament in the 2010 general election. His bid to oust Commons Speaker John Bercow as an MP failed, after he dramatically survived a plane crash while campaigning on polling day. After a dire general election campaign under Lord Pearson, the party re-elected Mr Farage as leader in November 2010. Election drama: Mr Farage stood for to become an MP in 2010 and dramatically survived a plane crash on polling day when the light aircraft came down at Hinton-in-the-Hedges airfield, near Brackley . Since then the party has seen a surge in support, leap-frogging the Lib Dems in the polls and winning one in four votes in local elections in May this year. Now the party is predicting it could win elections to the European Parliament in 2014, before trying to secure its first MPs a year later. However this week the party has faced fresh accusations of racism after UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom complained about Britain sending foreign aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’. Racism row: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom, pictured with wife Katryna and terrier dog Chippy, sparked a storm by referring to 'Bonga Bonga land' He offered up several explanations to prove the comment it was not racist. Yesterday he insisted that a bongo is a ‘white antelope, lives in the forest, there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever’. Critics were quick to point out that the bongo antelope is not white, it is brown. Earlier he said: ‘I don’t know where Ruritania is either – there is no such place of course is there? Like the Third World. Where is the Third World?’ And he suggested: ‘It might have been misconstrued by President Bongo of the Gambon, he may have thought I was talking about him. ‘If he is offended, I shall write to his excellency in short order and say, “I’m very sorry I wasn’t talking about you”.' However, Ali Bongo is president of Gabon, not Gambon. Repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a racist, Mr Bloom told Channel 4 News interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy: ‘Move on, there’s a good fellow. If you’re not going to move on to serious issues, I’m not going to continue – I can’t be bothered with it.’ He then tore off his earpiece and stormed off.","UKIP leader admits he will be at 'end of the road' if votes want to stay in .

They may be only a few hours old but these newborn pandas are already enjoying life in the spotlight as they wave to cameras. Little Yuan Zai was born to born to giant panda Yuan Yuan at Taipei City Zoo, Taiwan last month. A team of keepers have been working around the clock to take care of the female panda cub, who is being cared for in an incubator. Yuan Zai, a newborn giant panda, gives her fans a huge wave. She was born at Taipei City Zoo to parents Yuan Yuan and Tuan Tuan . Their daily routine includes feeding the cub, taking her temperature after each meal, changing her bedding and keeping track of her weight, zoo official Chang Chi-hua said. Yuan Yuan and her mate, Tuan Tuan, were gifted to Taiwan by China in late 2008 as a cross-Taiwan Strait gesture of goodwill and Yuan Zai is their first cub. The public will have to wait another couple of months before they can catch a glimpse of the first panda born in Taiwan. Zush, the baby panda, cheerfully greets the world by putting his paws up in the air. He was born at Highland Wildlife Park, near Kingussie in the Scottish Highlands . Over at Highland Wildlife Park zoo keepers have been celebrating the birth of a little boy. Kitty and Kevyn, the Park's pair of red pandas, are officially proud parents to Kush. Keepers are pleased with the youngster's progress, with first-time mum Kitty taking great care of him. Born at the beginning of June, Kush is also the Park's first ever red panda cub and the first to be born in one of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's animal collections in 13 years. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections for the Highland Wildlife Park said: 'Kush's current preoccupation is eating and sleeping, mainly the latter, and he was fairly affronted when we interrupted his afternoon nap to give him his initial examination. 'There was a little bit of growling and barking and trying to appear big and dangerous when we were examining him, but it was a little difficult to take something that cute and fluffy seriously.' Kitty and Kevyn, who are both two years old, joined the Park only last year with Kitty arriving in May from Berlin Tierpark and Kevyn two months later from Aalborg Zoo, Denmark. Keepers are particularly pleased with the arrival of Kush as the pair had only recently reached sexual maturity. Red panda cubs are born completely helpless and take a few months to develop. At first they are very small and completely blind, relying completely on their mother for protection. They resemble very fluffy guinea pigs for several weeks and only start to venture outside of their den at approximately three months old. Due to their sensitivity, Kush and his parents will be off show for the next few weeks.","Little girl Yuan Zai was born at Taipei City Zoo to giant pandas Yuan Yuan and Tuan Tuan .

A former farm worker had to call upon his experience of lambing to deliver his baby daughter at home after frantic phone calls to a labour ward went unanswered. Tristan Jones, 25, became a temporary midwife, and then a father to his daughter Caitlin, after helping wife Lisa, 31, through the birth. His experience of lambing came in useful when his wife began having contractions at 3am on July 27. Tristan Jones, 25, had to call upon his knowledge of lambing when his wife, Lisa, 31, gave birth to their daughter, Caitlin, in their living room . Mrs Jones gave birth in the living room of the couple's home in Leeds at 5.45am after struggling to contact the labour ward at the city's St James's University Hospital for almost three hours. Mr Jones said: ‘Instinct took over to look after them. I had to keep it together and get on with it. ‘There should've been someone at least on the phone to be able to talk to us. It's just wrong.’ He added: ‘I became really involved with the lambing at a friend’s farm when I was at school and sometimes I'd be on the farm for around 12 hours a day. ‘Lambing is not that different to being a midwife as the main thing is to keep calm and be careful. ‘I had reared hundreds of lambs during my time on the farm, but it's nothing that compares to the feeling of becoming a midwife for Caitlin and Lisa. When Mrs Jones went into labour, the couple repeatedly tried to call St James's University Hospital, in Leeds, but they claim that they did not get an answer . When they couldn't contact St James's, the couple called Leeds General Infirmary, where staff told them to wait until the contractions were five minutes apart before trying St James's again . ‘My heart was racing and inside I was shaking uncontrollably. Thankfully I managed to compose myself in front of Lisa. ‘The only training I have is first aid, and I think Lisa was really proud of how I managed to deliver Caitlin safely. ‘I can't wait to be able to tell Caitlin when she grows up the story that we have and how she was born.’ When Mrs Jones went into labour she called her hospital, St James’s, but says she got no reply so called Leeds General Infirmary instead. When the birth was imminent, they say they still couldn't get in touch with St James's so they called an ambulance. The call handler talked Mr Jones through the birth . Medical staff told her to wait at home until her contractions were five minutes apart before she called back, but when she did, she says she was told to keep trying St James's. She kept trying St James’s every few minutes but claims that she got no answer and did not have time to drive to the hospital. Mrs Jones said: ‘When I rang LGI, they told me to call back when my contractions reached five minutes apart, and when I did, they told me to keep trying St James's, who wouldn't pick up. ‘I felt like I had been sent round the block and felt fobbed off by both hospitals, one of which didn't answer. Caitlin was born at 5.45am on July 27. Paramedics arrived five minutes after the birth and took the trio to St James's University Hospital . ‘In hindsight, I would have called the ambulance service earlier but we were told not to bother ringing the emergency services and keep trying the labour ward at St James's. ‘When we finally arrived at St James's after the ambulance took us there, there were around six people sat behind the desks so I can't believe no-one was there to answer our call.’ Mr Jones eventually called 999 when it became apparent that the birth was imminent, and an operator talked him through the delivery. Paramedics were on the scene about five minutes after Caitlin was born and the new family were finally taken to St James's Hospital. A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: 'We are sorry Ms Jones had difficulty in contacting St James's maternity unit and can find no explanation as other calls were received' Mother-of-three Mrs Jones, said: ‘I had no choice but to have Tristan play midwife. He's a proper hero and I couldn't have done it without him. ‘It's disgusting that they weren't around to help people and didn't pick up the phone. It made me really mad because it put my life at risk. ‘I'm lucky we had a happy ending with Caitlin. It was traumatic but we have a beautiful baby and I'd like to thank the paramedics.’ She added: ‘I just don't want it to happen to anybody else.’ Speaking of her husband’s actions, Mrs Jones said: ‘I knew Tristan had done farming before but he had no training during my pregnancy on how to deliver a baby. ‘He's my hero and I couldn't ask for a better husband. It's the ultimate thing for a husband to do to deliver his own daughter.’ The hospital says that it is happy to discuss Mrs Jones' concerns with her if she wishes. She says she just doesn't want anyone else to have the same experience . The couple, who are both full-time parents, also have another daughter Lexi, 13 months, and Mrs Jones has another child from a previous relationship. A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: ‘We are sorry Ms Jones had difficulty in contacting St James's maternity unit and can find no explanation as other calls were received and logged during that period. ‘Ms Jones did contact the maternity assessment centre at the LGI on three occasions and spoke to one of the midwives who, based on the details provided, advised her accordingly. ‘Unfortunately she went on to deliver her baby very quickly following the last call. Labour can be unpredictable when a woman has had more than one child. ‘If Ms Jones would like to contact us we are happy to discuss her concerns.’","Tristan Jones, 25, delivered Caitlin with the help of a 999 call handler .

Bouncer Darren Frost, 42, then joined in and grabbed the man while the pair scuffled on the floor. Messed with the wrong people: Steve Harris (left) and Darren Frost (right) tackled the armed robber in a bank . Meanwhile a pub landlady, well trained in dealing with brawls, pinned his hands to the floor and called the police. Rugby player Mr Harris said his training from the sports field and the cage came in handy during the drama at Lloyds bank in Taunton on Monday. He said: 'I saw him in the corner of my eye and I could see he had a weapon of some sort - I thought it was an iron bar.

The 6ft former bouncer - who is a tree surgeon by trade - added: 'It happened so quickly, I was making sure he did not hurt anyone including my daughter. 'I tackled him to the floor and others helped restrain him while I put him in an arm lock until police arrived.' Bouncer Mr Frost, who is 6ft and weighs more than 17 stone, added: 'People were shouting and screaming; it was sheer panic. 'I was not going to let Steve deal with him on his own so I helped out - it was very quick and very spontaneous. 'I didn't really think much of it at the time, and it was only when I was sat on him that I realised it was Steve, who I had worked with in the past. 'When the guy came in it was mostly families and old dears - I think the next day he probably realised coming in when me and Steve were there.'

With punts floating gently past the colleges of Cambridge University, the River Cam is usually a picture of peace and tranquillity. But an outbreak of ‘boorish behaviour’ has forced authorities to start drawing up new etiquette rules after a string of confrontations on the once-calm waterway. The Cam Conservators, who are responsible for keeping the peace on the river, said most of the problems were down to bad manners. Overcrowded: Bosses are clamping down on bad behaviour on the River Cam in the historic city of Cambridge after a pensioner was left with a broken leg in a 'hit-and-run' punt collision . However they revealed that one of the more serious incidents saw a 70-year-old man break his leg in a ‘hit-and-run’ collision. The pensioner, who was steering a college punt, had his leg crushed by another boat carrying tourists down the river. Despite being left with blood ‘pouring down’ his leg, he was ignored by the other punt, which sailed on without stopping to help. In another incident, the coach of a Cambridge University rowing eights boat which sped past a motorboat club too quickly responded to protests by shouting 'we have been doing this for 200 years and we don’t care about you'. The incident happened at Waterbeach, when two eights practised a racing start at full speed just outside the motorboat club’s moorings. Club members shouted at the crews to slow down but were greeted with laughter, and the coach responded rudely when a boater tried to speak to him on the opposite side of the river. The report said the teams could now face penalties or prosecutions under river by-laws. Action must be taken: The Cam Conservators, who are responsible for keeping the peace on the river, said most of the problems were down to bad manners . 'Bad manners on the river are not acceptable': Previous accidents prompted the Conservators to ban 'illegal' punt operators, but several have now returned to Garret Hostel Bridge, despite the threat of fines . Other incidents recorded in recent months include a rowing eight squeezing through a tight gap at top speed while a narrowboat owner was attempting to reach his mooring and rowing boats crashing into motor cruisers on two occasions and crews rowing off without apologising. Cam Conservator Clive Brown said they hoped the guidelines, which are yet to be finalised, would improve the situation, adding: ‘There has been some really quite boorish behaviour with people who were in the wrong not apologising and just being rude. ‘Bad manners on the river are not acceptable and never have been. ‘Standards have slipped and that is a pity.’ Two years ago a toddler had to have plastic surgery after its finger was crushed by punts on the 'overcrowded' River Cam, prompting illegal punt operators to be banned. The 18-month-old’s finger was trapped between two punts and had to go to Addenbrooke’s Hospital where surgeons battled to save the finger. In another incident a four-year-old girl had her hand badly crushed when a ferry punt collided with a self-hire punt and she had to have her finger re-constructed at hospital. The horrific accidents prompted the Cam Conservators to ban 'illegal' punt operators, but several have now returned to Garret Hostel Bridge, despite the threat of a £2,000 fine. 'Fines were brought in to clamp down on the number of punt companies operating on the river,' said a punt operator, who did not want to be named. 'But many illegal companies are ignoring them as only one person has been fined so far and they make so much money they can afford to pay if they are caught.'","Cam Conservators say most problems down to bad manners .

A Royal Navy rapid reaction force is to set sail for Gibraltar on  Monday as tensions over the Rock continue to rise. Ten vessels including the aircraft  carrier Illustrious, two frigates and support ships are heading to the waters off Gibraltar as part of an annual exercise. But defence officials have revealed that three of them – the frigate Westminster and two support vessels – will call in at the British sovereign base at Gibraltar for three days, beginning on August 19. Setting sail: HMS Westminster will leave Britain on Monday and is expected in Gibraltar within days . Incoming: HMS Westminster (left) will set sail for Gibraltar on Monday. Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo (right) urged the government to 'demonstrate the waters are British by filling them with British assets' In a show of force, the warships will practise ‘a range of operations’ including ‘deterring adversaries’. Although diplomatic relations between . Britain and Spain over Gibraltar have plunged into the deep freeze, the . Ministry of Defence insisted that the mission, called Cougar ’13, is a . long-planned exercise. But senior government sources . conceded that the timing is convenient since it will reassure the people . of Gibraltar after Spain imposed draconian border checks in a  dispute . over fishing. And while the deployment could have been delayed to avoid upsetting the Spanish government, it was not. A Whitehall source said: ‘The timing . is not unhelpful.

But there was . absolutely no question of that.’ The deployment follows demands from . the government of Gibraltar for the coalition to beef up its naval . presence off the Rock, and calls for gunboat diplomacy from Tory MPs. David Cameron broke the news that the . task force was set to sail to his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy in a . tense phone call on Wednesday which failed to resolve the diplomatic . standoff. Appeal: David Cameron asked the Spanish Prime Minister to scale back contentious border checks with the British territory, including blocking flights to Gibraltar . Access: The Spanish government raised the prospect of imposing a 50 euros (£43) charge on vehicles entering Gibraltar and closing Spanish airspace to flights heading for the Rock . News that British warships are heading to Gibraltar is likely to add to the tensions with Spain . Downing Street claimed Mr Rajoy had . offered to ‘de-escalate’ the  crisis after Mr Cameron issued a coded . warning that Britain might take Spain to the European Court of Justice . over the ‘disproportionate’ border checks. But within minutes of the call, the Spanish government insisted they were doing nothing wrong. Spanish foreign minister Jose . Garcia-Margallo has threatened to impose tolls at the border and ban . Gibraltar-bound aircraft from Spanish airspace because the government of . Gibraltar sank concrete blocks off the Rock to deter Spanish fishermen. Last night Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, a . member of the all-party Parliamentary group on Gibraltar, said: ‘It’s . wonderful news that the Royal Navy is on its way but I’d prefer it if . this deployment was in response to the behaviour of the Spanish. ‘If they’re going down there, they might as well stay while this situation is going on. ‘The most powerful thing we could do . is to announce that the Queen is going to visit. That would send the . strongest signal that Gibraltar is British.’ On the ground, Spanish officials . again forced motorists to wait for hours yesterday, imposing more border . checks when they spotted UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall viewing their . operations. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Royal Navy’s annual Cougar deployment is long-planned and well-established. ‘Gibraltar is a strategic base for UK . defence and as such Royal Navy ships visit its waters throughout the . year as part of a range of regular and routine deployments.’ Tensions: The British Foreign Office fears the proposed Spanish border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to Spain for work .

Thousands of passengers had to be evacuated from Gatwick Airport this afternoon after a coach burst into flames outside. Smoke could be seen billowing from a pick up point outside the West Sussex airport's North terminal after a National Express coach caught fire shortly after noon. Passengers posted dramatic pictures of the fire on Twitter and panic set in that it may have been the result of a terror attack with security staff quickly calming passengers down. The cause of the fire is now being investigated but officials believe that it was most likely an accident. No one was hurt in the blaze, which destroyed most of the inside of the coach and took an hour for dozens of firefighters to extinguish. Witness Sophie Burnett told ITV News: 'The fire began around noon. They began by shutting the shops closest like Boots and M&S. 'They then evacuated the whole of North Terminal landside and have stopped all public transport coming over to the terminal including the shuttle and the public bus services.

A billionaire Saudi royal has lost a High Court fight with a Jordanian businesswoman after a judge described his evidence 'confusing and too unreliable'. Businessman Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud became embroiled in a dispute with Daad Sharab after selling an airliner to former Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Consultant Mrs Sharab helped broker the deal and sued the wealthy owner of the Savoy hotel in London claiming he owed her about £6.5million commission for the part she played. Unsatisfactory: A judge branded Prince Al-Waleed's evidence 'confusing and unreliable'. Right, consultant Daad Sharab, who is owed £6.5million by the prince following her successful claim . Although the prince disagreed, Judge Mr Justice Peter Smith today ruled against him. Mrs Sharab had said Prince Al-Waleed agreed to pay the commission in 2005 following a meeting in Col Gaddafi's tent in Libya. Prince Al-Waleed had disputed her claim, at a trial in London earlier this summer, and denied that any agreement was made for a 'specific commission'. Legal dispute: Prince Al-Waleed arriving at the High Court earlier today flanked by his legal team .

He said: 'At the end of the day I simply found his (Prince Al-Waleed) evidence confusing and too unreliable and Mrs Sharab's was more credible on any dispute of fact between them. 'Having seen the prince in the witness box and the evidence he gave, I found his evidence completely unsatisfactory. 'His memory had clearly gone as regards the detail of any of these transactions.

It goes on sale for the first time today, but it seems the latest face cream that promises miraculous results is already a sellout hit with women. Some 15,000 have downloaded vouchers online for a sample of the Forever Light Creator anti-ageing cream, which claims to give you a ‘flawless complexion’ by using the reflection of light. And more than 3,000 have reserved the product, made by Yves Saint Laurent. In fact, its makers claim, demand is so high that they have set up a helpline for those who discover their nearest pharmacy has run out. The product comes as a lotion or a serum and is said to even out the skin’s complexion and remove dark spots and shadows. It apparently contains three types of sugars called glycans which reflect light and make the skin more radiant. Glycans occur naturally in our skin but gradually decline as we age, which is partly why our complexion becomes duller, less flexible and more uneven. The creams cost from £35 to £82, depending on the size of the bottle, and are aimed at women over 25. Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, said the product was a ‘world first’ which had taken three years to develop. ‘Our research has shown that women are now more concerned about age spots and uneven skin tone than they are about wrinkles,’ she said. ‘Forever Light Creator recreates truly luminous skin. It also significantly reduces the appearance of age spots, the tell-tale areas of darker pigmentation which distinguish an older face from the smooth, uniform complexion of youth, and gives skin a flawless look.’ The manufacturers claim that after one week of using the cream skin is ‘noticeably’ improved, and after two months red and dark spots will lighten and the complexion will become ‘more uniform’. Face of youth: Model Josephine Skriver advertises the product which is so popular that Yves Saint Laurent has set up a helpline for women whose local pharmacy runs out . But experts dismissed such promises and said it was usually impossible for any cream to banish all blemishes. Dr Ross Perry, a cosmetic surgeon for Cosmedics Skin Clinics, said: ‘Skin tone and pigmentation are so subjective. ‘There is no miracle treatment. As soon as you go back into the sun or get a bit of a tan, all pigmentation will come back. You can reduce it but it can easily return.’ He added: ‘Even the medically based products that have been clinically proven have a limited efficacy for removing pigmentation.’ Dr Sam Bunting, a cosmetic dermatologist based in Harley Street, said: ‘I don’t know of any topical non-prescription product that will make a major impact on red areas, which usually reflect the presence of dilated blood vessels in the skin as a consequence of either sun damage or rosacea.’","Forever Light Creator by Yves Saint Laurent costs between £35 and £82 .

But the TV series Sex And The City has had another unexpected outcome - helping to rid the world of pubic lice. There has been a huge decline in recent years in the number of cases of lice, with clinicians claiming that the rising popularity of Hollywood or Brazilian-style bikini waxes is the cause. Doctors from the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) believe they can link the lice decrease with the airing of an episode of Sex and the City in 2000 which sparked the waxing trend. Trend setter: Sex And The City, starring from left Cynthia Nixon, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Kim Cattrall, has been credited with sparking the waxing trend, resulting in a huge decline in the number of pubic lice cases . The episode shows several of the main characters - Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha - undergoing a wax where all the hair is removed. The pubic louse has infested humans for . thousands of years, with archaeologists discovering specimens in the UK . as far back as the 1st century AD. The pubic louse evolved from its . ancestor, the gorilla louse, about 3.3 million years ago and adapted to . live in areas on the human body with a similar density of hair to that . of the gorilla. Unfortunately this was a costly mistake, as a mere 3.3 . million years later the international success of ‘Sex and the City’ has . led to an unprecedented removal of this very hair. The increase of Brazilian or Hollywood waxing is believed to have caused a decrease in the cases of lice which are now on the threshold of going extinct . A UK study showed a fourfold increase in . its incidence, from 0.8 per cent in 1954 to 3.2 per cent in 1964, which may have been . due to increased sexual freedom. However, from 1997 to 2003 a further UK . study revealed a steep reduction in prevalence from about 0.41 per cent to . 0.17 per cent. The research due to be presented at the British Association of Dermatologists’ Annual Conference next week. Similar observations have also been reported from sexual health . specialists in Australia. Sydney's main sexual health clinic hasn't treated a woman with pubic lice since 2008 while male cases have fallen 80 per cent from about 100 a decade ago. A decrease in sexual activity could not have . accounted for this, as the prevalence of other sexually transmitted . diseases has increased. Dr Kun Sen Chen, one of the authors of . the presentation, said: 'Pubic hair removal has been practised by humans . for thousands of years, by cultures from all over the world, including . the Ancient Egyptians. 'However, until recently, with the rise of truly . global mass media, pubic lice have been able to weather changing . cultural attitudes to body hair. 'What we have seen at work is the law of . unintended consequences, in popularising hair removal Carrie Bradshaw . and co have contributed to ridding humanity of pest that had plagued . humans for millions of years. Sadly there isn’t an Emmy for that.' Before giving all the plaudits to the . writers of ‘Sex in the City’ it’s worth considering that other factors . for the decline in pubic lice numbers could include the reluctance of . patients to seek medical attention leading to self-treatment with . over-the-counter insecticidal treatments, therefore causing a decline in . recorded numbers. The research is due to be released at . the British Association of Dermatologists’ Annual Conference in . Liverpool next week.

Firms holding lucrative Whitehall contracts hired detective agencies accused of stealing private information, it emerged last night. It means the ‘secret hacking scandal’ has now reached the doors of Government. Last week, it emerged the country’s top crime-fighting agency had drawn up a list of 102 firms and individuals who employed corrupt private investigators. It has not been made public but the Mail understands that, among the 102, are at least two big businesses paid to work for Government departments. Police hold a second list containing a further 200 names, suggesting this may be only the tip of the iceberg. Scrutiny: Pressure is mounting on the Serious Organised Crime Agency to reveal the names of the law firms . Pressure is mounting on the Serious Organised Crime Agency to reveal the names of the law firms, insurers, banks and other big firms who used the services of the rogue private eyes. Soca has handed the original list of 102 names to the Commons Home Affairs Committee but is insisting it remain confidential. MPs want to find ways of publishing it, and will meet within weeks to discuss whether to use parliamentary privilege. Yesterday, committee chairman Keith Vaz said the public are ‘left impotent in their judgment’ without the names of the firms involved, which are known to include a FTSE 100 company and global financial institutions. MPs, including Keith Vaz, want to find ways of publishing the list . He has written to several regulators to ask for clarification on what guidelines, if any, they issue to organisations in their industry on the use of private investigators. They include the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, accountancy watchdog the ICAEW, the Office of Fair Trading and the Office of Rail Regulation. As pressure mounts on Soca to publish the list, ministers will face demands to investigate the ties between the firms named in it and Government departments. The Soca report was handed to ministers in 2008. It could prove hugely embarrassing if officials in sensitive departments have been oblivious to the fact they were handing taxpayers’ money to lawyers or other firms on the list. Last night Tory MP James Clappison, a senior member of the Home Affairs Committee, wrote to the Cabinet Office calling for an audit of Whitehall’s dealings with the companies identified by Soca. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, he said reports have suggested the Soca list contains the names of law firms and other large organisations. Mr Clappison wrote: ‘It could turn out to be the case that such firms and organisations on the list of clients of these private investigators have provided, and continue to provide, services to the Government. ‘In these circumstances, could I ask you what steps have been taken to ascertain if such firms and organisations have provided any services to the Government. ‘If they have, what steps have been taken to ascertain if such services have involved the use of these private investigators?’ Police have been criticised for trying to suppress the contents of the Soca list, effectively granting anonymity to the blue-chip companies on it. Soca says there is no proof the firms knew the detectives they employed were acting unlawfully. But critics say the police response contrasts starkly with their treatment of the media while investigating phone hacking, when journalists were arrested in dawn raids on their homes. Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to announce proposals this week that will require private detectives to have a licence to operate. Anyone found guilty of hacking or blagging – posing as someone to obtain personal information – would be barred.","Soca under pressure to name firms that have used rogue snoopers .

U.S. scientists have announced a significant breakthrough in the fight against malaria after a human trial of a new vaccine was 100 per cent effective against the disease for the first time in history. More than three dozen volunteers were given multiple doses of a vaccine produced with a weakened form of the mosquito-borne disease that kills around one million people a year. And their results were promising: The months-long trial was 100 per cent successful in protecting all of the subjects who received the strongest dose of the vaccine. The results, which suggest scientists could be nearing eliminating the disease, were released by researchers from the National Institutes of Health, the Navy, Army and other organizations Thursday. Breakthrough: Trial results published today revealed a vaccine against malaria proved 100 per cent effective against the mosquito-borne disease in subjects given the greatest dose - the first such vaccine in history . The vaccine, named PfSPZ, is made from weakened sporozoites which is the form of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum when it's in an infectious state, CNN reported on Thursday. For the trial, the samples of the parasite were weakened by radiation and then frozen - but it remained in its whole form, which invoked a response of the patients' immune system. In total, 57 people took part in the trial, with 40 receiving some dose of the vaccine. All were then bitten by infectious mosquitoes and scientists tested if they had developed the disease after a week. The six subjects who were given five intravenous doses of PfSPZ were entirely protected, with none becoming infected with the disease, the scientists announced in their findings. Small steps: The results refer to just six subjects who did not contract the disease weeks after being bitten by mosquitoes. This image shows a child being given a malaria test in Kenya . Vaccine: The PfSPZ vaccine is made from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum when it's in an infectious state. It was weakened with radiation and frozen before it was given to the subjects . Malaria, a tropical, mosquito-borne disease, causes fever and vomiting and can . disrupt the blood supply to vital organs if it remains untreated. These symptoms become evident around 10 to 15 days after being bitten. The parasite has become resistant to some treatments and, with no effective vaccine, trying to halt the disease has been limited to controlling mosquitoes, distributing pesticide-laced nets for homes and spraying the indoors of buildings with insecticides - the method known as vector control. At-risk people, including pregnant women and children, can also take antimalarial medications during seasons when the cases of malaria are highest. The CDC points out that no antimalarial drug is 100 per cent protective and should be used in conjunction with other measures like insecticides. Despite efforts, the disease still kills around one million people and leaves more than 200 million sick every year. Other results were promising but not watertight; Of the nine who received four doses of the vaccine, three became infected. But of 12 who received no vaccine, 11 tested positive for the disease. The people who were infected were then treated with an anti-malarial drug. None of the participants, who all took part in the study between October 2011 and October 2012, had any side effects from the new vaccine. Though the results were promising, greater testing is needed and, if this is successful, they said it will be years before the drug could be used in communities where it is required. Dr. William Schaffner, head of the preventive medicine department at Vanderbilt University's medical school, said it was 'a scientific advance' - but that it could be as many as 10 years before the vaccine can be scientifically proven, approved and distributed, CNN reported. 'This is not a vaccine that's ready for travelers to the developing world anytime soon,' he told CNN. 'However, from the point of view of science dealing with one of the big-three infectious causes of death around the world, it's a notable advance. And everybody will be holding their breath, watching to see whether this next trial works and how well it works.' Hope: Around 200 million people are sickened by the disease each year, like two-year-old daughter Aissata Dia, who is pictured as she is held by her mother Fatimata Harouna in Mauritania in June 2012 . He added that while the multiple, intravenous injections seemed a very cumbersome way to administer the vaccine 'desperate times call for desperate measures'. The focus now needs to be on larger groups in conditions where the disease is likely to be developed and tests need to be carried out on how effective the vaccine is over time, he said. 'We don't know how long this protection . lasts yet. Lots of questions remain,' he said. 'But that should not diminish the . fact that this is a scientific advance.' The vaccine was produced by Maryland company Sanaria Inc. and tested by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Naval Medical Research Center.","In a human trial, 100 per cent of subjects who received the top dose of vaccine PfSPZ were protected against the disease .

The trip will cost a cool $500,000 (£300,000) - entirely payable through PayPal, no doubt. In 2010, SpaceX became the first commercial company in history to launch a spacecraft into orbit and retrieve it, and has partnered with Nasa to carry out cargo deliveries to the International Space Station. Red alert: SpaceX is confident it can take paying passengers to Mars within 10 years . SpaceX launched its Dragon spacecraft into orbit atop a Falcon 9 rocket on December 8, 2010 . Musk told the BBC that he's confident his company will soon . be able to go even further and send paying customers to the Red Planet, . which lies around 140,000,000 miles away, possibly within 10 years - thanks to technology breakthroughs dramatically lowering the costs of space missions. He said: ‘Land on Mars, a round-trip ticket - half a million dollars. It can be done. ‘My vision is for a fully reusable rocket transport system between Earth and Mars that is able to re-fuel on Mars, so you don't have to carry the return fuel when you go there. ‘The whole system [must be] reusable - nothing is thrown away.' At present, he said, the technologies needed to pull off such a grand venture haven't been patented, so he remained tight-lipped about the precise methods SpaceX would use. But he added: ‘We will probably unveil the overall strategy later this year in a little more detail. I'm quite confident that it could work.’ At present SpaceX is preparing for a test flight in which it will attempt to send its Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station. The unmanned craft was due to fly to the ISS on February 7 - carrying a payload of non-essential supplies in case of failure. But this was postponed to allow for more engineering tests. SpaceX's Dragon capsule will fly within two miles of the space station, for a checkout of all its systems. Then it will close in, with station astronauts grabbing the capsule with a robotic arm. The Dragon ultimately will be released for a splashdown in the Pacific.

A new method for producing electricity from waste carbon dioxide emitted by power stations could be so efficient that it has the potential to create 400 times the amount of power that the Hoover Dam generates in a year, Dutch scientists have claimed. Researchers from the Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Water Technology in the Netherlands believe they have come up with a new technique to unlock the power of waste carbon dioxide pumped out of current power plants. Their system involves mixing water and other liquids with combustion gas comprising a high concentration of carbon dioxide that are pumped between two membranes to produce an electric current. Dutch scientists believe they have come up with a new technique to unlock the power of waste carbon dioxide pumped out of power plants (pictured) that could play a future role in reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, which are believed to contribute to global warming . Described in the American Chemical Society's  journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters, the method uses waste gases from power stations and industrial smoke stacks as a raw material to generate electricity. The scientists said that over 12 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide is created annually from coal, oil and natural gas power stations, while home and commercial heating systems generate another 11 billion tonnes of the greenhouse gas. The team came up with a way to use the waste gas from power stations, industry and homes that they believe could produce a staggering 1,570 billion kilowatts of electricity annually. The power equates to around 400 times the annual electrical output of the Hoover Dam, according to Bert Hamelers, a programme director at the centre. He pointed out that the electricity produced would not add any extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The scientists have come up with a way to use the waste gas from power stations, industry and homes that they believe could produce a staggering 1,570 kilowatts of electricity annually. The power equates to around 400 times the annual electrical output of the Hoover Dam (pictured) However, it will not remove carbon dioxide from the earth's atmosphere like carbon capture and storage techniques are intended to do. Dr Hamelers told NBC News: 'You use the energy that is now wasted. 'You bring it in and get the extra energy out, but you cannot sequester it.' Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process of collecting carbon dioxide from places like power plants and taking it to a storage site where it is buried in an underground geological formation, instead of entering the atmosphere. CCS has the potential to curb the contribution of fossil fuel emissions to global warming but although the method has been commercially used, the long-term storage of carbon dioxide is still a relatively new concept. There is also some way to go before the technology developed by the Dutch scientists can be used on a massive scale as it is currently a proof-of-concept technique. To test their theory, Dr Hamelers and his team used a well-known experiment to create bubbles of the gas and air through a liquid, NBC News reported. More development of the technology is necessary before it can be tested on a real power station (pictured). It is hoped that the method of generating extra energy could be used instead of expanding current power plants to meet increasing demand for electricity . Currently the process uses more energy than it produces but membrane-based processes that are proposed by the scientists to use in the 'real' technology use less energy. Dr Hamelers said: 'The objective for us was to show that, yes, there is this source of energy and, yes, you can harvest it.' Although he conceded that more development of the technology is necessary before it can be tested on a real power station.

Despite being dismissed as a mostly ancient disease, the threat of leprosy still exists in the U.S. today, and it can be dangerous if ignored. Commonly referred to in the Bible, leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease) has long been thought to have been eliminated – as effective treatments are available. However, the Health Resources and Services Administration has reported that there are currently about 6,500 cases of the disease in the U.S. Disease: Leprosy has long been thought to have been eliminated - as effective treatments are available, but that's not the case in places like Madagascar, where proper medical care is scarce . While the disease can be spread between humans through respiratory droplets, health officials warn that some Americans can be at risk when in contact with armadillos. Last year, a study on the armoured mammals found that them to be the only non-human creatures that can carry the bacteria that cause leprosy. Armadillos are native to mostly the southern portion of the U.S. in states like Texas, but can also be found in states as far east as Florida. Beware the armadillo: A study last year found that the mammals are the only non-human creatures that can carry the bacteria that cause leprosy . The study, conducted by Dr Richard W. Truman and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, linked . 30-40 cases of leprosy in the U.S. to armadillos. Hardship: In the worst cases of leprosy, fingers and toes are lost and blindness can occur . Dr Truman said in a statement: . 'Leprosy has been feared throughout human history, and there are still . regions in several countries, including in the southern United States, . where new cases of this disease continue to occur.’ According to the CDC, about 1-2million people worldwide have been left permanently disabled by leprosy. Leprosy, which mainly affects the skin, is not a killer and can easily be cured today. But in countries where proper medical care is scarce like Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Nepal, the disease can lead to damaged nerves if left untreated. Contrary to popular belief, leprosy does not cause a patient's arms and legs to fall off, but can cause hands and fingers to shrink. It typically starts as a light-coloured patch on the skin that can go unnoticed because it causes no pain. In the worst cases, fingers and toes are lost or blindness occurs. The bacteria that causes the disease multiplies very slowly, with an incubation period ranging anywhere from three to 20 years. The disease is caused by two different types of bacteria: Mycobacterium leprae and mycobacterium lepromatosis.","Currently 6,500 cases of leprosy in the United States .

'I'm scared,' Dana Bonanno wrote in her text message to her mother. She hasn't been seen since. The late-night text occurred on July 22, but Bonanno wasn't declared missing until five days later - despite repeated calls to police from her mother about her missing daughter. Missing: Bonanno (left) was last seen on July 22, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn . 'I . can’t stop to think about what’s going on and get upset. What good is . that going to do,' O’Connor told IOHUD.com on . Thursday. “We just need to find her.” Police finally went and spoke with Bonanno's roommate in the Greenpoint apartment they shared. The roommate told her she'd last seen Bonanno near their apartment, on Freeman Street. Bonanno moved to Brooklyn in 2012 and became active in the local music scene. The Stormville native also worked at A&E Networks, but was laid off in April. But friends and family say she was still a rather upbeat, happy woman. Last seen: The last place Bonanno was seen was Freeman Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn . 'She’s . a very outgoing and positive girl,' friend Daniel Mandelbaum said. 'That’s why we’re . all so worried. This is completely out of character for her.' Her mother agreed, saying that simply taking off because she was upset about something 'is not typical of her behavior.' Greenpoint is relatively safe section of Brooklyn. However, police were searching for a suspect in a sexual assault case in June. In that case, the attacker assaulted the woman at knife-point. Friends and family have since taken to social media to spread the word about Bonanno's disappearance, and to hopefully generate some tips as to her whereabouts.

Reassurance: Immigration Minister Mark Harper has insisted spot checks at train stations are not based on people's ethnicity . People being stopped at railway station for spot checks by immigration officers are not targeted on the basis of their race, the Immigration Minister has insisted. But Mark Harper admitted that the reason he could not reveal how many people of different ethnicities are stopped was because it is not recorded. Officials are instructed to only take down names, dates of birth and nationalities of people they stop. The minister said spot checks in London Underground stations were carried out on the basis of individuals' behaviour, not their appearance or skin colour. Checks at two Tube stations have led to 17 arrests on suspicion of immigration offences. No figures have been published as to how many people in total were stopped. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has launched an investigation . into the immigration checks for possible discrimination, and is also . probing a controversial Home Office advertising campaign, which saw vans . deployed in parts of London with the message to illegal immigrants that . they should 'go home' or face arrest. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Harper said: 'We are not carrying out random checks of people in the street and asking . people to show their papers. That's absolutely not what we are doing. We wouldn't have the lawful authority to do that. The operations carried out at two Tube stations were based on specific . intelligence about concerns that we had about those particular locations . and about the times when we conducted the operations. We weren't . stopping people based on their race or their ethnicity. We were only . stopping people and questioning them where we had a reasonable suspicion . that they were an immigration offender. 'These operations have been carried out for many years, and indeed also were carried out under the last government as well.' Explaining how officers choose individuals for questioning, Mr Harper said: There's two things that we use. The first thing is intelligence about the location and the time that we are carrying out the operation. That's not the only thing you need to stop somebody and question them. You also need, about that individual, a reasonable suspicion that they are an immigration offender. Controversial: The European Human Rights Commission is looking into the Home Office's 'Go home' vans, which are being driven around London . 'They are not allowed to do it based on someone's physical appearance. If, someone, when seeing an immigration officer, behaved in a very suspicious way, that might give us reasonable suspicion to question them. 'It's about how they behave, not what they look like. It's not about their appearance or their race or their ethnicity.' Mr Harper said it was made clear to those stopped that they do not have to answer questions if they do not wish to. 'If we don't have sufficient grounds to arrest somebody, then we aren't able to do so,' he said. 'The questioning we carry out is a consensual one and the person doesn't have to be questioned at all, and that should be made clear to them when they are questioned.' Data on the numbers stopped for questioning will be released 'in due course', said Mr Harper. Labour immigration spokesman Chris Bryant has written to Home Secretary Theresa May demanding details of how many people were stopped for questioning and what proportion led to the detection of suspected offences. He told Today: 'I would like her to give us exact details of how many people have been arrested, how many people have been stopped, what ethnicity they were. If it feels as if what is basically happening is that they are going to some parts of the country and stopping every person with a black face, then that is totally unacceptable.' High profile: The Home Office tweeted images of arrests during a crackdown on illegal immigrants on Thursday . Arrests: A suspect illegal immigrant is caught by Border Agency officials in a raid at a nail bar in Swansea on Friday . The Home Office's own guidance says that an immigration officer can only stop somebody if they have intelligence to say that that person may be an illegal immigrant, said Mr Bryant. 'What we really need from Theresa May - and I think this is a matter of urgency now, because we have had a sort of moral panic that's been created by all of this over the last 10 days and I have a hateful fear that this is what the general election is going to be like - is precise numbers of where these stops and searches were being done, what the percentage was of people who were arrested,' he said. 'They need to have a better intelligence-led operation. What we have seen since 2010 is that the number of illegal immigrants removed from the country has fallen, the number of people stopped at our borders has fallen, and the number of foreign criminals deported has fallen. I think we could get that end of the equation right first.' More than 130 suspected illegal immigrants were arrested on Thursday in a crackdown on rogue employers that was highly publicised by the Home Office through the department's website and micro-blogging site Twitter. An EHRC spokesman said yesterday: 'The commission is writing to the Home Office about these reported operations, confirming that it will be examining the powers used and the justification for them, in order to assess whether unlawful discrimination took place. 'The letter will also ask questions about the extent to which the Home Office complied with its public sector equality duty when planning the recent advertising campaign targeted at illegal migration.'","Mark Harper insisted checks are based on people's behaviour, not race .

Backbench Tory MPs have been ordered by their party’s hierarchy to stop attacking the Prime Minister on Twitter. They were urged to exercise more caution when tweeting to avoid damaging the Conservatives’  general election prospects. Tory strategist Lynton Crosby met MPs last night with David Cameron to discuss their tactics for the 2015 poll. Ticking off: Tory MPs are to be told to stop speculating on Twitter about David Cameron's chances of wining the next election . Backbenchers were told to refrain from criticising the party’s policies and leadership in the wake of the disastrous Eastleigh by-election which saw the Tories relegated to third behind UKIP. No 10 has reminded MPs that they are ‘participants, not commentators’ after a string of tweets were seen as ‘distracting’. MPs were told instead ‘to get out the message that we have created one million extra private sector jobs, that net migration has reduced by a third and that crime is down. These messages are being drowned out.’ One of the MPs who regularly criticises Downing Street on Twitter is Dr Sarah Wollaston. Help or hindrance? Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston and Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant are among the Tory backbenchers to use Twitter to criticise the party leadership . Within two hours of MailOnline reporting on the warning from No 10 to Tory MPs that they are 'participants not commentators', Dr Wollaston took to Twitter to insist she would not be silenced, including the message: **** *** . Dr Wollaston then deleted the message, and reposted it without the asterisks . When Home Secretary Theresa May made a . speech over the weekend that was widely seen as a leadership pitch, Dr . Wollaston reinforced the idea that Mr Cameron was in trouble. She tweeted that the No 10 ‘inner circle . still look far too posh, male and white’ adding that ‘Cameron is . running out of time to fix it’. On Monday night, she tweeted: ‘We don’t . need a leadership challenge but I would challenge the leader to change . his advisers.’ Tory election guru Lynton Crosby will tell MPs that they must focus on key messages like job creation and reforming welfare . Then after word got out that Tory MPs . were encouraged to stop tweeting criticism of the PM, Dr Wollaston . tweeted the message ‘**** ***’. Former whip Michael Fabricant is another prolific tweeter. The MP was openly discussing his party’s . problems during the Eastleigh by-election, tweeting that many of the . policies trumpeted by UKIP were Tory ideas but voters did not realise . this ‘because of mixed messaging’. The PM has become a late convert to Twitter, following his pronouncement . in 2009 that ‘too many tweets might make a t**t’. Now officials at Tory . HQ are encouraging MPs to follow his Twitter messages. When Mr Cameron . tweets, they are urged to retweet the message to their own followers. Last night Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘Things are so bad . for Cameron that he is reduced to gagging his own backbench MPs on . Twitter because he’s fearful that they might tell it how it is. ‘This is a weak and increasingly out of touch prime minister desperately trying to stop his divided party imploding.’ But Tory MP Eleanor Laing said: ‘There are some people who are openly . talking about challenges to the leadership. They should all be quiet.’ Mark Pritchard questioned why Mr Cameron had taken so long to 'catch up' with backbench opinion on Europe . Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson, a frequent critic of Mr Cameron, urged the PM to realise more right-wing policies would be popular . While his colleagues post a stream of comments online, the PM uses his account for more mundane messages, like this one from a visit to Mercedes-Benz in Buckinghamshire yesterday .","No 10 has grown increasingly annoyed at Conservatives using Twitter to air their grievances .

Brian Banks says his pre-season debut with the Atlanta Falcons after his rape conviction was overturned was 'better than any roller-coaster ride you can ever get on.' The 28 year old spent five years in prison and five years on probation following his conviction of rape and kidnapping charges a decade ago. But now he is free to finally pursue his career as a NFL linebacker because the woman who made the charge when Banks was a 16-year-old high school junior recanted her accusation. Back on the field: Atlanta Falcons linebacker Brian Banks walks off the field after a preseason NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengal . Banks (number 53) on the field, said being back in the game 'is better than any roller-coaster ride you can ever get on' The conviction was overturned by a California court on May 12, 2012. Banks, who signed with the Falcons in March, had two tackles in the Falcons' 34-10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday night. Banks had been trying to get back into football since he was cleared of the conviction. The Falcons are the first NFL team to sign Banks, but he has had chances with other teams, including the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers and Seattle Seahawks. He took part in the Seahawks' minicamp last June following workouts in Kansas City and San Diego. Banks was 16 and had a scholarship offer from USC when a Long Beach Poly high school classmate accused him of the rape. The 28-year-old linebacker Banks could cherish the high on the field even more than a normal rookie . Banks is now living out his NFL dream, that he never gave up hope on while in prison . The woman recanted her claim and offered to help Banks clear his name after he was out of prison. That helped lead to the conviction being overturned by a California court and Banks' record cleared. Banks has become a spokesman for the California Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongly accused. Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff said in a statement in April: 'We . are pleased to have Brian join our team. We had a chance to work him . out last year and have been monitoring his progress since then. 'He . has worked extremely hard for this chance over the last year and he has . shown us that he is prepared for this opportunity. We are happy that . Brian will have a chance to live out his dream of playing in the NFL and . we look forward to seeing him on the field.' Banks spent five years in prison and five years on probation following his conviction of rape and kidnapping charges, which were later overturned . Redemption: Banks is pictured during his tryouts with the Seattle Seahawks last year . Four months after he was cleared of the charges, the linebacker signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. Banks was 16 and had just been offered a scholarship to USC when Wanetta Gibson accused him of sexual assault and kidnapping in 2002. He . was on the way to the school office to talk about his college . applications when he bumped into Gibson, a fellow student, and they went . to a stairwell to make out, his attorney Justin Brooks said. He . explained that Banks said something to upset Gibson and they parted on . bad terms. She later accused him of kidnapping her, dragging her across . the school and raping her in the stairwell. Investigators . tested her but found no physical evidence of rape, Brooks said. Banks . maintained they had not had sex and all sexual contact had been . consensual. Brian Banks seen overcome with emotion in May 2012 in a California court when his conviction was overturned . Freed: Once a standout football star, Brian Banks, pictured weeping after his rape conviction was dismissed last year, was just 16 when a classmate accused him of kidnapping and raping her . Yet his then-lawyer encouraged the . promising student to plead no contest to the kidnap and rape charges, . warning Banks he could get 41 years to life in prison if convicted. Expecting he would serve just 18 . months instead, he followed the advice and pleaded no contest - and was . put behind bars for nearly six years - but he never lost sight of his . NFL dream. He told ESPN last year that he has been seriously training since October 2011, saying: 'After all I’ve been through these last 10 years, I can still do some things that will impress you.' He was exonerated in May after Gibson added him as a friend on Facebook when he left prison . with a tag a few months earlier. In a message, she explained she wanted to 'let bygones be . bygones.' Brooks said his client met Gibson and caught her on video saying there there had been no kidnap and no . rape, and would help him clear his record.

Yet she refused to repeat the story to prosecutors as she feared she . would have to return a $1.5million payment she won after her mother . brought a suit against Long Beach Schools. She was quoted as telling Banks: 'I will go through with helping you but . it's like at the same time all that money they gave us, I mean gave me, . I don't want to have to pay it back.' The Los Angeles Times also reported . that Gibson had been worried the admission would affect her . relationship with her two young children.

A pair of kinky South Florida cops have been arrested and accused of threatening to arrest two women they pulled over for drunk driving if they didn't give them sexual favors. Lauderhill police officer Franklin Harley, 32, demanded oral sex from the passenger of the car and then had sex with her for about 30 minutes, according to charges filed Thursday. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports his partner, Officer Thomas Merenda, 35, had a slightly kinkier demand for the driver, prosecutors say.  'Officer Merenda asked the victim to punch him in the 'nuts,' meaning genital area,' court documents said. He told her he'd slap her in handcuffs for DUI if she didn't, prosecutors say. 'Hit me': Officer Thomas Merenda, 35, (left) allegedly demanded a woman punch him in the testicles during a traffic stop. His partner Franklin Harley, 32, (right) allegedly had sex with the passenger . The driver refused, but Harley - having allegedly sex with the passenger reassured her. 'Tom really enjoys this,' Harley said. Prosecutors say Merenda gets aroused by having his testicles injured - they even dug up two witnesses to confirm this fact - so they charged him with unlawful compensation, illegally benefiting from his position. Both officers - who are married with two children each - have been charged with felony unlawful compensation and misdemeanor battery. Both were suspended without pay from the Lauderhill police department. The lawyer for both officers deny the charges and say their families are standing by them. 'The only thing that's nuts here is the prosecution of this case and the way it's been filed,' Eric Schwartzreich told the Sun-Sentinel. Prosecutors say the encounter began when Hartley pulled over two women, age 31 and 29, who were leaving the Vegas Cabaret strip club in May 2012. The women were pulled over after leaving Vegas Cabaret, a strip club in Lauderville, Florida . The women admitted they had been drinking and Hartley told them both to pull their car behind a nearby strip club. He then called over his partner Merenda to join him. Authorities say GPS trackers on the squad cars confirm both officers were at the location for 30 minutes. The women allege that Hartley then demanded sex from the passenger and said he would arrest both women if she didn't oblige. Merenda is accused of demanding he be struck in the testicles. Both officers also allegedly groped the women before sending them on their way.","Officer Thomas Merenda allegedly told the driver that if she didn't to be punch him in the testicles he would arrest her .

The study revealed that 33 per cent of young Britons take pain medication every day while 32 per cent would take a painkiller within 20 minutes of experiencing pain. The survey, by Tiger Balm, also found that the most common reason for taking a painkiller is a tension headache. This could be explained by the fact that . 41 per cent of the young people interviewed believe that their . generation is under more stress than any other. One third of 18 to 24-year-old Britons take painkillers on a daily basis, according to a new survey . The survey also revealed confusion about how painkillers reduce pain. When asked how they understood painkillers to work, 40 per cent of under 25s believed they only ‘mask’ the pain rather than tackle it directly. The findings are concerning doctors as taking more than the maximum daily recommended dose of paracetamol can damage a person's liver. This is especially problematic in young people as the impact of painkillers on the liver is increased by drinking alcohol. It is also believed that taking ibuprofen regularly may cause stomach ulcers. Experts have warned that many young people could actually be giving themselves headaches by taking too many painkillers - a condition known as rebound headaches - which can trigger painkiller abuse. The risk of this is highest for those taking aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol at least every other day to treat headaches or another sources of pain. There are also fears that young people may not realise that products such as cold and flu remedies contain paracetamol, so they end up having a double dose. # . Research released late last year . found that more than 62 million prescriptions are written annually on . the NHS, a 30 per cent rise in only five years. Figures show another six billion pills were bought over the counter last year, with sales growing at 4.1 per cent annually. But . there are concerns that tens of thousands of adults – mainly women – . are addicted to the drugs, having initially taken them to ease a minor . ailment. The study revealed that 32 per cent of young Britons take a painkiller within 20 minutes of experiencing pain and the most common cause is a headache . And this week, a leading expert spoke . out about the dangers of taking co-codamol, an opioid painkiller, which . can be highly addictive. The drug, which contains paracetamol . and codeine, creates a feeling of calm and well-being which can be . addictive, especially for women. The problem is so severe that GP Dr Des Spence, from Glasgow, is calling for urgent research into the scale of the issue. However, co-codamol is not the only painkiller that comes with a health warning. Doctors have been told to stop prescribing diclofenac to people with heart conditions or circulation problems. It is believed that the drug can increase a patient's risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. As a result, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said that it should not be given to people with serious underlying heart conditions.","32% of young Britons take painkillers within 20 minutes of experiencing pain .

Detroit Lions’ stars Louis Delmas, who is black, and Tony Scheffler, who is white, have revealed they often use racial slurs when greeting each other. The two players have spoken out about their use of provocative language after Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was famously caught on video earlier this month using the N-word at a Kenny Chesney concert. Cooper was quickly forced to make a public apology and agree to undergo counseling, but his fellow professional's admission to using similar language isn’t an attempt to excuse his behavior. Scroll down for video . Detroit Lions’ stars Louis Delmas, right, and Tony Scheffler, left, have revealed they often use racial slurs when greeting each other . Delmas and Scheffler say they’ve earned the right to use such language around each other because they have a strong bond of friendship that goes beyond simply playing for the same team. The pair have known each other for 10 years, going back to when they were both at Western Michigan University and Scheffler, then a senior, took the freshman Delmas under his wing. They've revealed to the Detroit News that typical banter between them consists of Delmas saying ‘Hey, cracker’ and Scheffler responding with ‘How’s my n*****?’ ‘Me and [Scheffler] have a relationship many people do not have - both black and white,’ Delmas told the newspaper. The pair have known each other for 10 years, when they were at Western Michigan University Scheffler, then a senior, took the freshman Delmas under his wing . ‘I look at him like my brother. I love him to death. He greets me, ‘What up, n*****?' But I understand it. So I say, 'What's up, cracker?' But we would never take it outside the building.’ Scheffler says he is well aware of the history of the word and the sensitivity he must apply. He says he would use it in relation to another teammate that and that he never calls Delmas the N-word outside the dressing room or in front of his family. 'I treat Louis like a little brother,' he said. 'He knows my wife and kids. He calls me ""white boy"" and ""cracker."" We go back and forth with it and we are both comfortable with each other. 'I can't say the same with other relationships in the locker room or how other guys would feel about it. So it is a tough dynamic when you are using those types of words. Everybody does not react the same.' Both players are adamant that such provocative language is okay within the confines of the Lions practice facility, it isn’t acceptable anywhere else. Slur: Pointing his finger aggressively at the crowd and the camera, Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper, pictured, launches into a racist tirade . With regards Cooper's recent drunken rant, Delmas believes he deserves his punishment and 'needed to learn a lesson.' ‘The way the public blew up the [Cooper] situation, it should be blown up that way because he needs to learn a lesson. You can't say that. You will never see me going outside the building calling someone cracker. You can't do that.' 'We know each other so well that it just comes out,' said Delmas talking of his banter with Scheffler. 'And when it comes out, we don't take it personally. We love each other to death. But outside here it is a word that should not be used.' Cooper was excused from team activities to undergo sensitivity training earlier this month after his racist rant came to light . The wide receiver shouted 'I will jump that fence and fight every n***** here,' at Lincoln Financial Field, the Eagles' home field, after a Kenny Chesney concert on June 9. Despite his quick apology, Cooper was excused from team activities and admitted to sensitivity training, as well as paying an undisclosed fine leveled by the team. 'I owe an apology to the fans and to . this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did . was wrong and I will accept the consequences,' Cooper said in a televised apology. Press conference: Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper meets with the media at NFL football training camp on Wednesday, July 31, 2013, in Philadelphia . Aggressive: Cooper, pictured in the sleeveless red shirt, snaps at his companion as things get tense inside the venue . 'This is kind of the lowest of lows. This isn't the type of person I want to be portrayed as. This isn't the type of person that I am. 'I know no one in Philadelphia is happy with me right now. I accept that. I just hope they see the true me. And accept my apology.' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined to say if the league would take further discipline. 'The NFL stands for diversity and inclusion. Comments like this are wrong, offensive, and unacceptable,' Aiello said. The tape, obtained by Philadelphia sporting blog Crossing Broad, shows Cooper, dressed in a sleeveless red and black plaid shirt and with his blonde hair in a ponytail, push a man's hand off his shoulder before launching into the tirade. It's not clear what his companion said immediately prior to the remark. Apology: The 25-year-old, pictured on field, was quick to apologize for his behavior on Wednesday afternoon, after the video showing the racial slur went viral online . No excuses: 'I owe an apology to the fans and to this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did was wrong and I will accept the consequences,' he tweeted . He then brushes his hand away again and turns around, at which point a bottle of beer is clearly visible in the footballer's hand. Afterwards, the country star pulled Cooper, teammate Jason Kelce and coach Chip Kelly on stage to perform 'Boys of Fall.' Cooper was a fifth-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. He had 23 catches for 248 receiving yards last season for the Eagles. He is expected to compete for a starting wide receiver job to replace the injured Jeremy Maclin.","Detroit Lions' stars Louis Delmas, who .
