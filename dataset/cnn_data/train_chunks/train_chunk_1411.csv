"Singer Glen Campbell's wife said that he’s probably ‘not aware’ that he was nominated for an Oscar for best song, because of his advancing Alzheimer’s. Mr Campbell was nominated for the song I’m Not Gonna Miss You, a goodbye to his loved ones, which features in the documentary Glen Campbell, I’ll Be Me. Country singer Tim McGraw performed a moving rendition of it during the Academy Awards show last night, as Mr Campbell is now too poorly to play in public.

Moving: Glen Campbell pictured on his goodbye UK tour at the Lowry Theatre in Manchester . Kim Campbell said on the red carpet before the ceremony that her husband wouldn’t really understand what was happening. She said: ‘I'm not sure if he's really aware but he will be at his own little Oscar party tonight. It would be lovely to go back and let him hold one. It's just hard for him to understand.’ Best Song gong went to rap artist Common and R&B star John Legend for Glory, the anthem from Selma. Glen Campbell, I’ll Be Me documents how the singer and his family came to terms with his condition and his farewell tour across America in 2011, which saw him perform in 151 sold-out shows. The documentary features appearances from Bruce Springsteen, The Edge and Paul McCartney. The best actor award went to Brit Eddie Redmayne, who was almost too choked to speak as he picked up the gong for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.

'This Oscar – wow! –this Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world, battling ALS,’ he added staring at the statuette in disbelief. Meanwhile, it might not have swept the board completely, but Birdman still flew home with the Oscar for Best Picture on the night. The comedy drama swooped off with a total of four awards on Sunday night - a number that tied with The Grand Budapest Hotel - including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. However, Birdman's lead actor Michael Keaton was beaten to his Best Actor by Eddie. Backstage, 33-year-old Eddie revealed that winning was like a 'weird and wild dream'. There were no surprises when it came to the actresses, with favourites Julianne Moore winning for Best Actress for Still Alice, and Patricia Arquette winning for Boyhood. The other big winner of the night was Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, taking home four awards in total. The energetic evening saw Oscar host Neil Patrick Harris put on a theatrical performance at the Kodak theatre. Neil, 41, only managed a few jokes before bringing out his jazz hands, performing a hilarious original song - Moving Pictures - about the great and good of Hollywood. Neil’s spirited routine - where he was joined by Anna Kendrick and Jack Black - paid tribute to some of Hollywood’s best known performances and scenes, and had the star-studded audience. Taking home the first of award of the night was J.K. Simmons for Whiplash - a perhaps unsurprising win considering he has swept the board in the same category this awards season. The actor - who won for his portrait of a demented music teacher in the film Whiplash - paid tribute to his wife Michelle Schumacher.

"The Caño Cristales river in Colombia is regarded by many as the most beautiful  in the world. Known as the 'liquid rainbow,' the spectacular waters are turned into a kaleidoscope of colour thanks to freshwater plants known as macarenia clavigera and endemic to the Sierra de la Macarena, a mountain range south of the capital Bogota. During the short time between the wet and dry season, July to November, along with moss, aquatic plants and corals, the red plants cling to rocks throughout the 62-mile long river, and help create a fusion of colours just under the surface of the water. Scroll down for video . Pits have been created along the length of the river that the macarenia clavigera plants cling to creating a beautiful sight . A fusion of five colours are created by a mix of plants clashing with the grey rocks and the crystal blue waters . Tourists flock to the witness the display in season, with the crystal clear water showing the wildlife under the surface as well as the beautiful plants. Green, blue, black, red and yellow are all very visible during the season and locals say the best time to see the plants at their brightest is just after a storm, when the colours appear at their most vivid. The geological formation of the river is rich with sediment, and the rocks are some 1.2 billion years old. This, combined with the different-coloured plantation helps create the prism of colour. But for half the year, the river is much like any other; the bed of rocks creating a shimmering grey colour, with the odd splashes of green moss along the way. Looking like something from a pre-historic age, the colours of the plants almost make the water appear blood red . Tourists were warned from travelling to the Caño Cristales prior to 2009 due to terrorism and threats of damaging the environment . However, the Caño Cristales is not accessible by road; instead tourists will have to fly into La Macarena, then organise a short transfer to the Serrania de la Macarena National Park, where they can then make the last part of the journey by foot or on horseback. The Caño Cristales season runs from mid May to the start of December. It is not possible to book tours outside of these dates. The site was only re-opened to tourists in 2009 after years of terrorist activity, as well as the perceived threat of humans damaging the natural environment. There are also other important waterfalls such as Angostura I in the Guayabero and Caño Cafre rivers, surrounded by rocky edges with a great amount of 'petroglifos' (rock engravings), making the national park a sight to behold. You almost can't believe this is a river - but the Caño Cristales stretches over 60 miles and is wonderous in colours . The macarenia clavigera, left, is indigenous to the area of the macarenia clavigera, and right, the sunshine shows off the beauty . The clean and clear waters offer tourists the chance to discover just what causes such a fusion of colours in the Caño Cristales .","The macarenia clavigera, indigenous to the area, helps create a spectacular river view .

"MP Tim Yeo (pictured) has warned energy watchdog Ofgem that it needs to 'get its act together' Energy watchdog Ofgem needs to 'get its act together' to cut customers' energy bills, MPs have warned. In a scathing attack on the market regulator, the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee said Ofgem has failed to stop big companies from charging too much, despite new price caps intended to curb costs. The committee said the new caps were too generous and that network companies – those responsible for the wires and pipes that distribute gas and electricity – had continued to make huge profits. At the same, performance targets are too low and consumers are having to wait too long to see if Ofgem is delivering savings, it said. Committee chairman Tim Yeo said: 'Ofgem's chief executive told us that we would have to wait eight years to see whether value for money was being delivered for bill payers. This is too long for hard-pressed consumers to wait. 'Ofgem must get its act together and scrutinise these near monopolies more effectively. Simpler charging methodologies are needed to strengthen the market's ability to scrutinise costs and increase the pressure for greater cost-saving efficiencies. 'Barriers preventing smaller players from entering the market must be removed to drive down costs for consumers.' The so-called 'network costs' currently account for around 23 per cent of a gas and electricity dual fuel bill. They are passed onto consumers by the energy suppliers, who are charged by the network companies for using their transmission and distribution infrastructure. In 2013, Ofgem introduced a new price control system - known as RIIO - which was designed to ensure that the costs of distributing and transmitting gas and electricity were competitive and profits were not excessive. But the committee said there was 'clear evidence' that the network companies were making higher profits than expected. 'This suggests that the targets and incentives set by Ofgem are too low, barriers to market entry are high and that Ofgem needs to monitor RIIO more effectively and to equip RIIO with stronger, corrective measures,' it said. The Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee said Ofgem has failed to stop companies charging too much, despite  price caps intended to curb costs of distributing gas and electricity . 'While we recognise that the new RIIO framework is an improvement on its predecessor, Ofgem has not yet created the conditions for the market to thrive and provide consumers with best value for money.' The committee also highlighted the complexity of the charging system. It said a combination of codes and regional charges across the UK made it difficult to compare price and performance across network companies. It called on the Government and Ofgem to conduct an in-depth study into the merits of replacing the current system with a standard national tariff. The price of oil has more than halved since last summer, while gas – the main source of electricity in Britain – has dropped by 29 per cent. But power firms have reduced their prices only modestly. British Gas will cut its prices by 5 per cent at the end of this month. EDF has trimmed rates by just 1.3 per cent, while SSE has been ridiculed for refusing to introduce its 4.1 per cent cut until the end of April. Ed Miliband had pledged to freeze prices for two years if Labour wins power at the election in May. The policy has been widely criticised, and experts say many energy companies would have cut their tariffs sooner if the threat was not in place. Critics have also warned that the move would sap investment from Britain. Last week, a report by the Competition and Markets Authority said customers of the Big Six energy suppliers are being overcharged by up to £234 a year for gas and electricity. Ninety five per cent of the UK's 19million 'dual fuel' customers, those who get their gas and electricity from the same company, could have saved by switching, the probe found. Despite this, half of customers surveyed said they have never switched, and a third said they had never even considered it or thought switching was impossible.","MPs said Ofgem has failed to stop companies from charging too much .

"Motorists driving through Kuwait could not believe their eyes when it started raining money in the middle of the city. Thousands of notes flew through the oil-rich city on a busy afternoon earlier this month, and officials have yet to give an explanation as to why, or reveal a source of the cash. Drivers abandoned their cars in order to get their hands on the notes blowing down the road, and were filmed holding handfuls of notes. It is estimated that notes valued between two and three million Dirham were loose - meaning up to £500,000 was blowing in the wind. Making it rain: This is the incredible moment people abandoned their cars and ran into the streets of Kuwait after a strong wind carried hundreds of notes through the city . The notes were carried by strong winds through Kuwait for several minutes, but locals have got no idea where it came from. One surprised local described how his wife pulled over her car to film motorists dodging cash collectors on a busy stretch of highway in the city. He said: 'It was a very windy day. She was stuck in the traffic. She saw all this money. 'It was just raining money. It was 500 AED notes which is worth quite a lot. It was a lot of money. If you got money and you know it: Traffic came to a halt as drivers ran out to pick up notes which lined the streets of the oil-rich city .

"Profoundly deaf Shahab Reza, 52, has been jailed for nine years after admitting his role in a £800,000 disability allowance scam, pictured at Southwark Crown Court . The profoundly deaf ringleader of an £800,000 disability allowance scam has been jailed for nine years after spending the cash on diamonds and foreign holidays. Shahab Reza, 52, set up a network of fake companies around the world while receiving benefits and persuaded his wife Shehnaz, daughter and son to take part in his crimes. By submitting bogus invoices for sign language interpreters, the couple from west London duped officials out of the huge sum with 'scandalous ease', a court heard. The cash from the elaborate scam was used to buy a luxury home, a £600,000 penthouse, gold jewellery, an £8,000 'flawless' diamond, a holiday to Dubai and a 'student jolly' to America. Shehnaz Reza, 53, and her children, Dr Abbas Reza, 26, and Zainab Reza, 22, admitted the scam took place but insisted they were 'doing what they were told'. Southwark Crown Court heard today  that Reza's wife and children have since 'rejected' him. Judge John Price said that because of Reza's deafness, he would be condemned to 'a prison within a prison'. Reza's lawyer Rag Chand said he has 'literally lost everything'. Mr Chand said: 'The idea that this defendant lured others physically is an affront to common sense, but Mr Reza, through me, wishes to convey to the court this - through the interpreter who sits behind me, he said this in conference this morning: 'It was my fault. I should not have done it'.' 'He can't communicate with anybody. He doesn't communicate with anybody. 'He is the only person in his prison with this disability. 'That has had a hugely significant impact on his emotional state. 'He was certainly bullied at school for this disability and that has carried on at various stages throughout his adult life. 'It is even conceivable that in prison that is something that will be visited upon him. 'Greed got the better of this defendant and in my respectful submission that greed may have been more to do with pleasing others around him than necessarily his personal greed.' Judge John Price said Reza, who has been deaf since birth, 'had overcome that challenge very bravely'. Shehnaz Reza, 53, (left) and her children, Zainab, 22, (centre) and Abbas, 26, (right), were found guilty of fraud charges at an earlier hearing. The jury could not reach a verdict on Zainab . 'You son and daughter both reject you now - and your wife - understandably, because of the way you dragged them into a dishonest fraud. 'The aggravating factor is that you brought in your wife, you brought in your son, you brought in your daughter.' Shahab Reza orchestrated the four-year con by submitting fake invoices for sign language interpreters to the Department of Work and Pensions through the Access to Work scheme. The money was then laundered through six sham companies set up in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the UK to claim thousands every month in bogus fees. Shahab even used his connections at a local mosque and training college to recruit fraudsters to widen the scheme. The couple's son Abbas (pictured outside court) was found guilty of fraud charges at Southwark Crown Court at an earlier hearing . Southward Crown Court heard how Shahab and his wife Shehnaz, who are both deaf, oversaw a four-year benefit swindle on the Department of Work and Pensions using false invoices for sign language interpreters . Their ‘employees’ were given a cover story and paid hundreds of pounds a month for their ‘silence and co-operation’, the court heard. The court previously heard how Daiva Alisauskaite, 43, and Natela Babina, 30, helped pull off the fraud by submitting fake invoices for sign language interpreters. Alisauskaite made £8,000 while Babina pocketed £9,500, after they collectively submitted 48 false claims over 23 months. They were both handed 12-month prison sentences, suspended for 18 months. A jury had failed to reach verdicts against Zainab, Shehnaz and Abbas last December and they now face a retrial in September. Shahab Reza received six years for conspiracy to defraud and two years consecutive for each count of obtaining a money transfer by deception and dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability. He  admitted his role in the con before the trial began. His wife and son Dr Abbas Reza were both found guilty of fraud charges at an earlier hearing. The jury has not yet reached a verdict on whether daughter Zainab, 22, was involved.","Shahab Reza, 52, admitted stealing  £800,000 in disability benefits scam .

"A British oil rig worker in Indonesia heard his young wife die from a ruptured heart valve while she was receiving treatment in Shetland, 7,000 miles away. Darron Smith, 35, was working on the rig off Batam Island when he got a phone call from his mother to call home urgently as his 37-year-old wife Anna had been taken ill. Over the next 24 hours she was transported to Gilbert Bain Hospital on Shetland in preparation to be taken to Scottish mainland for specialist care, but her condition rapidly deteriorated. Knowing she was unlikely to survive, Mr Smith stayed on the phone while medical workers fought to save her life - and eventually heard them telling his mother the tragic news that she had died. Tragic: Darron Smith, 35, (left) was working  in Indonesia when he was told to call home urgently as his 37-year-old wife Anna (right) had been taken seriously ill. Below is their four year old daughter, Ava . Despite the trauma of hearing his wife die over the phone, Mr Smith is actually pleased that even though he had been in Indonesia at the time, he had a presence during the last minutes of her life. 'I take comfort in being with Anna in her last moments - even if it was on the phone and I was thousands of miles away,' he said. 'I heard my mum, Carolyn, say, Is she gone?' and the medical team confirm it... It was distressing, but comforting to be there, albeit thousands of miles away at the end of the phone.' It took Mr Smith five flights over two days to eventually get back home to Shetland after his wife's death on 23 January 2015. It is understood that she had ruptured a valve after suffering two massive cardiac arrests brought about by a previously undiagnosed heart condition. 'She was a young mother with everything to live for, she was fit and looked after herself,' Mr Smith said about his wife. Sad: It is understood that Anna Smith (pictured holding her daughter, Ava) had ruptured a valve after suffering two massive cardiac arrests brought about by a previously undiagnosed heart condition . Mr Smith spent the time waiting for his flight home downloading psychology books on how to help small children cope with the death of a parent - to better prepare him for helping their only daughter Ava, four, deal with her grief. 'Ava is coping much better than me at times, but children that age have a remarkable way of speaking up and stating what's happened,' he said. 'We will cope with losing Anna in the way Ava finds best,' he added. Mr Smith is now making memory boxes to help Ava remember her mother when she grows up. 'She will want to know what her mum was like,' he said. Memories: Mr Smith is hoping his four-year-old daughter Ava (right) will be able to deal with her grief of tragically losing her mother Anna (left) The dental nurse's death has struck a chord with friends, family and hundreds of people who never even met here, with £14,000 being raised in just a few days through a JustGiving fundraising page set up in Anna's memory. The money will be donated to the British Heart Foundation in order to help other cardiac patients. A team of heart specialists had been flown to Shetland's Gilbert Bain Hospital ready to transport Anna to a unit on the mainland but she died before she could be stablised for transfer. The previously healthy young mum died within hours of being admitted to hospital. 'Anna became ill so quickly they had to put her into a induced coma to prepare her for surgery,.' Mr Smith said. 'Every hospital doctor on Shetland had been put on alert to assist if needed. But she deteriorated so quickly she didn't make it to the operating table,' he added. 'One of the main doctors told me that it was the first time he had seen this happen in more than 30 years in the job,' Mr Smith went on to say. With his future changed so painfully, Darron is now wondering what he is going to do for employment with the rest of life. 'I have a lovely wee daughter to raise,' hesaid. 'Hopefully, I will find something which allows me to earn a living and be a dad at the same time. But it's early days and Anna has only been gone a month.... I know something suitable will turn up, he added'. * To donate to Anna's appeal, go to justgiving.com/Darron-Smith/ .","Darron Smith, 35, was working on an oil rig off Batam Island in Indonesia .

"A 30-year-old woman claiming benefits, who weighs nearly 22 stone, says she'd love to work but employers won't give her a chance because of her size. Kirsty Kennedy, from Stirling, has been on the dole for seven years and gets £500 a month in welfare handouts while she tries to find a job. 'I have applied for Poundland, I think Iceland are getting fed up of me asking all the time. I'm just getting to the point where I will take anything. Scroll down for video . Kirsty Kennedy from Stirling, pictured on Channel 5 show Benefits Britain, has been on the dole for seven years and gets £500 a month in welfare handouts . 'People look at me and think she's too heavy, we cannot take her,' she said on Channel 5 show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole. The documentary follows Kirsty as she trawls Stirling city centre dropping off her CV in stores so she can be considered for work. But she's not hopeful because of her 21st 11lb size. She said: 'I'm not exactly Twiggy but I'm here and willing to learn if you give me a try. It feels like they take one look and me and say ""you're not getting a job"".' Kirsty still lives at home with her parents Rosie, 57, and Des, 63. They also get £500 a month benefits as overweight Des has type 2 diabetes and is unable to work because of his poor health, and Rosie gets a carer's allowance for looking after her husband. The couple gave their daughter a Nissan Micra car and would love her to pass her driving test and get a job. Kirsty's parents also claim benefits as her father, Des, right, is unable to work due to his health and her mother, Rosie, left, acts as his carer . Rosie said of her daughter: 'She needs to learn to concrete and start listening.' Speaking to Kirsty, she said: 'If you're not earning, why is that car sitting out there?' Kirsty, who has a mild learning disorder, said she wants to be able to drive so she can widen her employment opportunities but she has failed her driving theory test five times. She said: 'I just get confused with directions. If someone gave me a map and told me to get to a place and go left, then right, I'll go the opposite to what they have told me.' Kirsty is enrolled on a Scottish work programme in order to gain her benefits which involves doing shifts for a charity dealing out food. Her participation in the programme means she qualifies for gym access which she has been using to try and lose weight. She currently has a Body Mass Index of 55 - which classes her as 'very severely obese' as healthy BMI is between 18.5 to 25. Kirsty admitted to her gym instructor that she has 'my good days and my bad days' when it comes to sticking to a diet. She explained: 'Bad days are one too many packets of crisps, a bit too much chocolate.' Kirsty, pictured here,  said employers often don't take her seriously because of her size . Her instructor said she will lose weight if she remains committed to a diet and consistently exercises three times a week. But Kirsty told the Daily Record that she needs more support to lose weight. She said: 'I know what I should be doing to lose weight. But I think I need someone to be firm with me. Not too hard on me - but just enough to tell me what I should be doing. 'I need someone to be a mentor. I have been under dieticians in the past and my weight has been like a yo-yo. It's difficult to keep it going in the right direction.' Kirsty is convinced that if she wasn't overweight she would get a job - but she admits she's not sure if she could cope with working full-time as being on the dole is all she's known. She said: 'I think I would struggle with a full-time job. I have never had one. I think I would struggle physically and mentally.'

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to brief Whitehall mandarins on the SNP's expensive shopping list should the party hold the balance of power in a hung parliament . Nicola Sturgeon has demanded talks with the UK's top civil servants ahead of the election, sparking claims that Scottish Nationalist MPs are 'preparing' to enter government at Westminster. The First Minister wants to brief Whitehall mandarins on the SNP's expensive shopping list should the party hold the balance of power in a hung parliament. It is tradition for civil servants to meet opposition politicians who could form the next government before an election, allowing them to prepare for sudden policy changes. Miss Sturgeon wants to prop up Ed Miliband in Downing Street, even if Labour is the second largest party after the Tories. The most likely scenario would be a confidence-and-supply arrangement rather than a formal left-wing coalition – but that has not been categorically ruled out by either party. In return, the First Minister would make a series of unrealistic demands – such as scrapping the replacement programme for Trident nuclear missiles, a Scottish veto over an in/out EU referendum, and sweeping new powers for Holyrood that would effectively end the Union that over 2million Scots voted to save last year. She has also said she also wants an extra £180billion to be spent over four years on the UK's credit card, derailing plans to cut Britain's deficit. Miss Sturgeon has now written a letter to UK Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to ask for talks – which would have to be sanctioned by Prime Minister David Cameron. She outlines some of the SNP's post-election demands, although Labour pointed out that she fails to mention further powers for Holyrood. 'I am writing with regard to the contact between opposition parties and the civil service prior to General Elections, which has become a standard feature of the UK's democratic processes,' the letter states. 'These meetings - which as you know require to be sanctioned by the Prime Minister - enable an opposition party to brief civil servants on its policy agenda, and gain deeper understanding of the systems of policy delivery in Whitehall.' It adds: 'The SNP programme includes a substantial alternative to the austerity cuts supported by the UK Westminster parties, cancelling the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system, and a requirement that each and every constituent nation of the UK would have to vote to leave the European Union in any in/out referendum before the UK could exit. 'These and other policies which we will seek to advance in the next parliament are obviously of UK-wide application, and I believe that the Whitehall system would benefit from becoming more familiar with our propositions.' Miss Sturgeon has now written a letter to UK Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood (pictured) to ask for talks – which would have to be sanctioned by Prime Minister David Cameron . Asked if the coalition will give the SNP access to the civil service, Commons leader William Hague yesterday told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: 'That will be up to the Cabinet Secretary. 'We are a very democratic county and we do indeed open up to opposition parties. We benefited from that before the last election. 'Those decisions are generally up to the senior civil servants and it's not up to the Government in power whether to deny any cooperation or planning to people on the other side of politics so that is up to them. 'But I think this does illustrate a very important point - the SNP are preparing for that and Labour will not deny they will enter into a coalition with the SNP.' A Labour insider said Miss Sturgeon 'will get the brush off from the civil service'. 'Random politicians can't just turn up at talks,' said the source. Commons leader William Hague stressed that any decision to open up the civil service to the SNP would be made by the Cabinet Secretary . A Scottish Labour spokesman added: 'In her letter Nicola Sturgeon has chosen not to mention her number one priority in the general election – ending the Barnett formula so Scottish spending is only supported by Scottish taxes. 'Binning Barnett would cost Scotland billions so perhaps it is no surprise that he SNP have decided to keep quiet about but the people Scotland deserve to know that SNP plans would put public services and pensions at risk. ' SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: 'I think it makes perfect sense for the civil service to look at our manifesto when it's published so if there is a deal to be done, if there's discussions to be had, then they can be done on a proper professional technical level in terms of how we might be able to support a minority Labour administration.' A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said: 'We can confirm that we have received the letter, it is a matter for the Prime Minister and he will respond in due course.'","First Minister wants to brief mandarins on SNP's expensive shopping list .

"When lifeboatman Mark Thorne lost his wedding ring in the sea during an emergency call-out, he pulled out all the stops to get it back. He scoured the shoreline with a metal detector and even searched for it underwater using scuba gear, before finally giving up hope. Now, six years later, he has finally been reunited with the precious piece of jewellery after a friend stumbled across it during a walk at low tide. Lifeboatman Mark Thorne has been reunited with his wedding ring, six years after he lost it in the sea . Mr Thorne, pictured with his wife Sarah, lost his ring at sea while he was helping to launch a life boat in 2009 . Mr Thorne's platinum ring, which has a distinctive dent, came off his finger and plopped into the water in 2009 as he helped to launch a lifeboat in Weymouth Harbour, Dorset. It was eventually found by his friend Steve Woolford who had taken a stroll along the shoreline. Mr Woolford said he had remembered the lost ring and thought 'you never know, it's worth a look' – before spotting it glinting in the mud. He added that he was 'over the moon' with the discovery. Mr Thorne said he was 'really, really chuffed' to be reunited with the ring. 'When I was a lifeboatman every time I got a shout I would move it to my right hand because it fitted better on that hand when my hands got cold,' Mr Thorne, who is now a paramedic, said. 'But it pinged off and plopped into the harbour. REunited: The platinum band was found in low tide. six years after it 'plopped' into the water . Mr Thorne's friend Steve Woolford found the ring as he walked along the haroburside . 'After I lost it I searched in dry suits with some fellow crew but found nothing. I even employed a man with a metal detector to help find it and went down every month on low spring tides to no avail. 'Luckily the ring does still fit but it was always slightly loose. 'I really did believe it was gone until Steve found it years later. I'd like to say a massive thank you to him for continuing to look, even after I'd given up finding it.' Mr Thorne's wife Sarah added: 'It's absolutely crazy. When Mark lost it I never thought I'd see it again but it's definitely his ring. It's an incredible end to the story.' The former lifeboatman, who married in 2004, said: 'I think I owe Steve a bottle of whisky.' Mr Thorne scoured the shoreline with a metal detector and even searched for the ring underwater using scuba gear after losing it during an emergency call-out . Mr Woolford said he had always kept an eye out for the ring because he works on the harbour. He said: 'It was an exceptionally low tide in Saturday afternoon so thought I would have a look, just in case. 'I climbed down the ladder to get onto the seabed and literally just two feet out in the mud there it was. 'I remember Mark telling me it was a thin, platinum ring with a smell dent in which was the same as the one I found. 'The magnitude of the situation didn't sink in at first and I put it on Facebook rather than phone Mark straight away. 'He saw it later that evening and came and picked it up. If we were women we would have been hugging each other and crying about it, but Mark said ""cheers"" and I'm waiting for him to buy me a beer. 'It is a great feeling to give the ring back to him after all these years. He must have resigned himself to the fact that he had lost it forever.'","Mark Thorne's platinum ring fell into Weymouth Harbour during a call-out .

"There are few places in Britain you could take these spectacular images - the iridescent colours of the Milky Way illuminating the night sky. But one photographer has found a perfect spot to capture the constellations in stunning definition - the pitch-black countryside of the Isle of Wight. Astro-photographer Jamie Currie, 35, has been taking pictures of the phenomenon in locations across the island over the past 18 months. Scroll down for video . It was on a starry night: Bembridge Lifeboat station on the Isle of Wight photographed at a very low spring tide . Stunning sights: The Milky Way in the countryside (left) and photographer Jamie Currie looking towards its northern part (right) Vibrant scene: Gurnard Beach huts, in an image which has 200 photos laid on top of each other to show the stars moving around the world . Space age: A gorilla-shaped rock facing south-west from Freshwater Bay out to sea (left) and Castlehaven in the south of the island (right) Known for its low levels of light pollution, the idyllic island is a hotspot for stargazers to capture the immense beauty of the disk-shaped galaxy. It contains between 100billion and 400billion stars but cannot be distinguished properly with the naked eye. Mr Currie said: ‘I have always been interested in the night sky and wanted to try something different with my camera. ‘Astro was the way to go. The pictures were all taken on the Isle of Wight over the last 12 to 18 months. It’s turned into a bit of a labour of love. Illuminating the night sky: St Catherine's Oratory, which is the oldest lighthouse on the island - and is said to have been built in 1328 . On the lookout: St Catherine's Lighthouse (left), built near the Oratory; and a view from Froglands Lane, south-west of Newport (right) Things are looking up: Galactic hunters chasing the Milky Way capture another couple of stargazers on the Isle of Wight . Colourful stars: Whale Chine steps used for many years - but shut to the public due to recent landslips (left), and hay bales in a field (right) ‘The Isle of Wight is very good for astro-photography due to the little light pollution on the south coast of the island.’ In what looks like a rainbow of stars arched across the night sky, one photograph shows the glowing band looming over St Catherine’s Oratory on the southerly tip of the island. Another depicts Bembridge Lifeboat station below an explosion of luminous colours. According to Mr Currie, a former Royal Marines Commando from the Isle of Wight, most of his shots are taken using a Canon 6D camera over a 30-second period with very high ISO - light sensitivity - levels to capture the Milky Way, which is just visible with the naked eye. Mr Currie said low light pollution is crucial to capturing the galaxy on camera. He said: ‘I have been very interested in taking photos of the Milky Way over the last two years. ‘The light pollution on the Isle of Wight allows me to pull as much possible light into the camera to capture the billions of stars in the galaxy. It’s a truly astounding phenomenon. 'I would like to travel to the Yellowstone National Park in the future to capture the Milky Way at its very best as there is very little light pollution.’","Astro-photographer Jamie Currie says Isle of Wight countryside is best place to capture constellations .

"Moms who are against vaccinating their children have responded to the backlash against them, suggesting they are a 'medical choice' that 'should be researched carefully'. Three mothers — all of them educated, middle-class professionals — are among the skeptics who have been widely ridiculed since more than 100 people fell ill in a measles outbreak traced to Disneyland. Critics question their intelligence, their parenting, even their sanity. Some have been called criminals for foregoing shots for their children that are overwhelmingly shown to be safe and effective. 'Contrary to the common sentiment, we are not anti-science,' said Michelle Moore, a businesswoman who lives in the affluent Portland suburb of Lake Oswego with her 2½-year-old twin girls. 'I'm not opposed to medicine, and I think vaccines have a place. We think it's a medical choice, and it should be researched carefully.' Scroll down for video . Michelle Moore, win daughters, Sierra, right, and Savannah is not opposed to medicine but thinks vaccines have a place and are a medical choice that should be researched carefully . The backlash, much of it from people who fear unvaccinated children could infect their own kids, has been so severe that dozens of anti-vaccine parents contacted by The Associated Press were afraid to speak out. But a handful of mothers agreed to discuss their thinking. Moore, an MBA graduate who runs an agriculture-related business, traces her feelings back to the time she took Lariam, a supposedly safe anti-malaria medication. Instead, she said, the drug saddled her with multiple health complications. She questions whether the government knew about the risks at the time. Health officials now acknowledge Lariam can cause severe side effects, some of which can be permanent. That experience broke Moore's trust in the medical establishment and launched her on years of research into how vaccines can affect people's health. When she got pregnant, Moore and her husband delayed immunization for Sierra and Savannah. 'It was not an easy decision,' she said. 'The thought of something happening to them because we chose not to vaccinate is terrifying. But I have so many questions, and I do think it's the right decision for our family.' Nancy Babcock of Spokane, Washington, says people who share her opinions 'are being vilified and ostracized.' Babcock, a vice president at a bank, told her daughter about her doubts. Then her daughter and her husband looked into the issue, and they decided not to immunize their two children. 'In a community with many young people, those who don't vaccinate are feeling a lot of pressure,' she said. Nationwide, parents who seek an exemption from vaccine requirements are still in a tiny minority. The median total exemption rate for kindergartners during the 2013-14 school year was just 1.8 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But some individual schools or communities have higher exemption rates, at times approaching 60 percent or more. Sonja Wright, left, of Ellensburg, Washington, holds her daughter Iris, four months, as she waits to testify against House Bill 2009 that would remove personal or philosophical opposition as an acceptable reason for parents to not vaccinate their school-age children . The CDC says years of testing are required before a vaccine is approved, and the shots are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness. Anti-vaccination parents include a mix of views — from religious communities to families practicing alternative medicine and libertarians who shun government interference. But many are Americans with college degrees living in liberal communities such as Santa Monica or Marin County in California and Portland, said Gary Freed, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. Most hesitant parents do not avoid all vaccinations. They typically under-vaccinate, either delaying the shots until their child is older or refusing certain vaccines while continuing with others, Freed said. The parents who spoke to AP recounted spending hundreds of hours reviewing medical studies, books and news stories and networking on social media. They cited cases of children who were supposedly hurt by vaccines and the existence of a government-run vaccine injury-compensation program. And they worried about the oversight of pharmaceutical companies that reap profits from vaccines and are shielded from liability when a vaccine causes harm. Moore said she read a 1998 study published in The Lancet journal by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who raised the possibility of a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, bowel disease and autism. She said she knows the study was later discredited and retracted. She believes the research was inconclusive. Moore concedes that the vast majority of studies show vaccines are safe, but she says some research points to inconsistencies, unknowns or negative effects that deserve further investigation. And while autism is still a concern, Moore and others also worry about how exposure to chemicals, bad nutrition and stress can affect genes and health. They say large doses of synthetic additives found in vaccines, including aluminum and mercury, can harm the immune and digestive systems and brain. They're believers in living naturally and eating organic food who also question the safety of genetically modified organisms, pesticides and other common substances such as flame retardants and plastics. 'There are so many environmental toxins, but anything in my children's world that I can influence I do,' Moore said. The CDC has phased out a mercury-containing preservative in vaccines as a precautionary measure, and the agency says vaccines containing aluminum pose extremely low risk to infants. Federal officials also say GMOs in foods are safe, as are pesticides if used according to labels. More than 100 people have fallen ill as a result of the outbreak at Disneyland - prompting anti-vaxxers to be vilified and ostracized . These parents say they should be able to decide whether their child undergoes a medical procedure — a decision, they say, that goes to the core of what it means to have freedom of choice. 'I have the right to decide what to put into my child's body,' said Heather Dillard, a mom in Springfield, Missouri, who is also a registered nurse. 'Nobody has the right to put toxic chemicals into my son's bloodstream. That's taking my rights away, and it's very scary to me.' Dillard said she decided against vaccinating because her first child was born a preemie and has autism. Dillard does not believe vaccines caused the autism, but the disease led her to do a lot of research about health. She says she now chooses to build her son's immunity naturally, through diet, while avoiding shots or other medication. Dillard and others say they are not worried about measles because their children have strong immune systems. They cite statistics: Out of the 1,000-plus measles cases in the past decade, there was not a single death. 'What I'm more nervous about is the hysteria that would result,' if her children were to get ill, Moore said. Moore said she does worry about affecting children who are immune-compromised and cannot be vaccinated. Before visiting friends with babies or young children, she said, she always informs them her twins are not vaccinated 'so they have the power to make a choice.' She also keeps the girls home at any sign of sickness. Researchers say berating parents who oppose vaccines will not persuade anyone and only puts people on the defensive. Educational messages from health officials may also make little difference and could, in fact, be counterproductive, said Brendan Nyhan, assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College. A study conducted by Nyhan and his colleagues last year showed that when parents were presented with evidence that vaccines do not cause autism or that measles cause great harm, some ended up feeling even more ambivalent. 'We tend to be skeptical toward information that contradicts our existing views,' Nyhan said. If Oregon were to take away the right to a vaccine exemption, Moore said, she would likely home-school her twins. She's keeping an open mind about vaccinating as her children get older, but hopes more studies on the long-term effects of vaccines can help dispel her doubts. 'I worry about living in a society that's progressively more intolerant toward any dissent,' Moore said. 'All scientific advances have come from questioning the status quo.'","Skeptics have been vilified after 100 people fell ill in outbreak .

"An electrician accused of murdering his girlfriend by stamping on her head when she refused to give him her Facebook password claimed they would often use each other's accounts to play Candy Crush saga. Kane Boyce, 34, allegedly killed 20 year-old Paula Newman at the home they shared in Croydon in South London, when she stopped him from reading her online messages after becoming obsessed with the idea she was cheating on him. Boyce has denied the murder of his girlfriend, and has previously claimed she fell out of his BMW during a late night drive. Kane Boyce (left) has denied murdering his girlfriend Paula Newman (right) in a row over getting her Facebook password as he told the Old Bailey he had it anyway and regularly used it to play Candy Crush . He admitted pushing her over the evening before she died during an argument in the street, after he claimed she accused him of having an affair. He told the court she fell over and he helped her back into the car. The 34-year-old told a hearing at the Old Bailey that the couple both regularly accessed each other's Facebook accounts to give eachother extra lives to play Candy Crush saga, a mobile phone game. ‘You get four lives an hour or something,’ he added. ‘I went on her phone to send myself a life so I could carry on playing.’ He added: ‘Yes we knew each other’s passwords because we would often send each other lives on that game we used to play.' Boyce said while he was on Facebook he noticed Miss Newman had been sending messages to an ex-boyfriend, in which she referred to Boyce as an a*******. He admitted to the court that he was upset over the message and took a screenshot to post it to his own account, so people would see 'there was another side to her.'  He also said they had had used her account to send messages to his girlfriend's former partner. Boyce admitted pushing Miss Newman over during an argument in the street on the evening before she died. He said Miss Newman accused him of sleeping with 'a tart' as they drove around the area off Lodge Lane in New Addington. 'Paula was shouting at me to stop the car. I just carried on,' he said. 'She started lunging at me to grab the wheel. I felt a blow to my face. In order to get her off me I struck out with my hand.' He said the argument continued after he stopped the car near some garages. 'She was still saying I was sleeping with that tart. I said the only reasons she is saying that is because she has been talking to people on Facebook as well.' He said he shouted at her: 'Log on or give me back my phone'. Boyce added: 'She had my phone, she was using it to log into her emails.' However the prosecution claim he shouted: 'If you don't log on we will see what happens.' He said he got out of his car and followed Miss Newman to Parkway and told her to calm down and come home. 'She tried pushing past me. I pushed her quite hard and she stumbled back and she banged herself on the side of the garages. 'It was just like she fainted. She fell over. I wasn't expecting her to fall into the garages. 'I didn't intend for any of it. I helped her up and took her back to the car.' Boyce told the court he would go on his girlfriend's account to give himself more lives to play Candy Crush . Ms Newman was taken to hospital on the morning of 12 November 2013 but died later the same day. A previous hearing was told that a post mortem found she had died of head injuries. The trial was previously told that in the weeks before her death Boyce became obsessed with checking his girlfriend's Facebook account. He was described as manipulative and having a history of violence against women. Boyce admitted he had previous convictions for assault and harassment against a former partner but added: ‘I was quite young and immature.’ After this he married another woman but met Ms Newman after moving out of the marital home into a friend’s house in around March 2013. Boyce said they started a relationship after around six or seven weeks and added: ‘I did love her. It was hard but I loved her and I think she loved me as well.’ He claimed they went out nightfishing and on his superbike together. But he denied keeping her in the house so she could not go out. He was also asked about abusive messages the pair sent each other, and said: ‘We used to watch box sets of Shameless, our language did come from there. It wasn’t always like that.’ The pair had been together just seven months when Miss Newman died. Boyce, from Erith, southeast London, denies murder. The trial continues.

It's by Stella McCartney and we love the padded shoulders and dramatic puddle train. Whilst a white maxi dress might seem a bit too bridal, the key is to keep it simple like this one. Add a chunky choker and numerous cocktail rings a la Beyonce and you won't be in danger of anyone thinking you're about to walk down the aisle!

Jennifer Lopez wore a cleavage-exposing dress to the Oscar ceremony and then changed into this revealing gown at the Vanity Fair party. The sheer nude dress meant she wore neither bra or knickers for the evening . Speaking of the trend for revealing outfits at the after-parties stylist Jules Standish told FEMAIL: 'Once the formal ceremony is over it's OK for the celebrities to let their hair down and get into their revealing after-show-stopping outfits. 'Rita Ora, Irina Shayk and Gigi Hadid all seemed in competition to see who could wear as little of their black dresses as possible. Irina shows us all why she is a top lingerie model with an intricate outfit of black tights with what seems to be a dress attached. No underwear modelling needed here. 'Rita Ora shows off her stunningly fit derriere in her sheer dress, and Gigi wears a cut-out dress with swirls which leaves no place (or need in her case) for Spanx or any other body hugging under garments. 'These girls are daring, brave and want the world to know they are outgoing, risk taking ladies – there's nowhere better to get a guaranteed picture in the press than the Oscars after-party and with a green ticket to be as outrageous as they like.' Miranda Kerr attends the Vanity Fair Oscars Party wearing a full-length Emilio Pucci gown, with side cut-aways and a plunging neckline . 31-year-old Victoria’s Secret model Miranda Kerr showed off her assets in a revealing custom Emilio Pucci gown, Lorraine Schwartz jewels, Jimmy Choo shoes and Judith Lieber clutch . Flashing the flesh: Kylie Minogue showed off her toned legs in a revealing powder-blue by Ralph & Russo gown at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills . Nicole Scherzinger showed off her newly dyed blonde locks at Elton John's Oscars Viewing Party wearing a very low-cut black gown, complete with cut-away sides and back . Actress Lily Collins flashed the flesh is a backless dress which showed she wasn't wearing a bra at the Vanity Fair bash . Lady Victoria Hervey didn't look very ladylike at Elton John's party in this revealing gown - but unlike Rita, she did fully cover her bottom .

"Microsoft's Bing has often played second fiddle to Google, but at the Oscars, it shone - correctly predicting 20 of the 24 results. Bing successfully predicted best picture, best director, best actor, best actress, and the results for supporting actor and actress. Even the four predictions it got wrong were its second choice predictions. Scroll down for video . Microsoft's scorecard: Only four predictions were wrong out of the 24 made by the Bing prediction system. Microsoft says its predictions are based on a 'several attributes beyond accuracy, including flexibility, scalability, and timeliness.' The key was to find people skilled at predictions. 'Prediction markets follow a select group of people who have high levels of information on what voters will do and are willing to wager real-money on the outcomes,' the firm said. 'Perfectly calibrated 20 of 24 (w/ 4 2nd place winners),' said David Rothschild, who leads Microsoft's New York team. Ahead of the Oscars Microsoft shared its latest predictions, claiming that most of the awards are 'relatively unpredictable.' Microsoft uses a prediction model for the Oscars managed by  Rothschild  at the company's New York City research lab. He correctly predicted 21 of 24 Oscar winners last year, and 19 of 24 winners in 2013. This year, he said, said that many of the categories were influenced by films not nominated. Before the ceremony, many online comments were objecting to the lack of nominations for 'Selma,' and, on a light-hearted note, incredulity about 'The Lego Movie' not receiving an Animated Feature Film nomination. Rothschild said that doesn't mean the un-nominated can't affect the Oscar winners in those 'disputed' categories. 'Absence in the category makes a difference in the distribution of votes for the remaining choices,' he said. 'As this controversy ebbed and flowed over the last few weeks, we had to make sure to take into account how it may affect the final votes,' he said. 'Whenever I create predictions I focus on several attributes beyond accuracy, including flexibility, scalability, and timeliness,' Rothschild said. However, he admitted that the pubic can't always be trusted. 'One way to take this into account is to follow the public opinion on the topic and assume that public opinion will translate into pressure on the voters. 'However, public opinion is only loosely related to winners in the Oscars, because the sentiment and expectations of the general public is closely tied to name recognition and popularity.' A night full of stars: The Koda Theatre in LA was filled to the brim with Hollywood's leading actors . The man who predicted the Oscars: David Rothschild, who leads Microsoft's New York team. Rothschild says it's also difficult to match public opinion to a specific category. 'There are not even many alternatives to express dissatisfaction in the nomination process in that there is no clear movie for people to support in lieu of Selma's lack of nominations.' The key was to find people skilled at predictions. 'Prediction markets follow a select group of people who have high levels of information on what voters will do and are willing to wager real-money on the outcomes,' he says. 'And, prediction market-based forecasts have been incredibly accurate,' hence the aforementioned successful predictions of previous years' Oscar winners. 'Had you asked me about the likely winners in the top six categories last week, two of them would have been different,' Rothschild admitted. The winners of the 87th Annual Academy Awards were announced in Los Angeles on Sunday evening. Continuing his clean sweep of awards season, emotional Eddie Redmayne was almost too choked to speak as he picked up Best Actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. 'Thank you – I don't I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now but please know this – I am fully aware of that I am lucky, lucky man,' he began, clutching his trophy. 'This Oscar – wow! –this Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world, battling ALS,' he added staring at the statuette in disbelief. Meanwhile, it might not have swept the board completely, but Birdman still flew home with the Oscar for Best Picture on the night. The comedy drama swooped off with a total of four awards on Sunday night - a number that tied with The Grand Budapest Hotel - including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Overcome: British actor Eddie Redmayne, 33, gave an emotional speech as he was named Best Actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything - a win predicted by Microsoft. Elegant as ever: The 54-year-old beauty wore her hair in a sleek updo and set off the look with a pair of sparkly drop earrings . The 87th annual ceremony favoured niche movies instead of big box office hits, with films including American Sniper and Wild missing out on the top prizes. However, Birdman's lead actor Michael Keaton was beaten to his Best Actor by Eddie. Backstage, 33-year-old Eddie revealed that winning was like a 'weird and wild dream'. There were no surprises when it came to the actresses, with favourites Julianne Moore winning for Best Actress for Still Alice, and Patricia Arquette winning for Boyhood. Julianne became emotional when she revealed for the first time that her husband Bart Freundlich predicted she would win the Oscar. 'I've never told anyone this... but [my husband] was the first person to see the film. 'He was crying and I was like what's going on?' she said. 'When we walked out he said you're going to win an Oscar and I said 'Like come on!'. The other big winner of the night was Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, taking home four awards in total. The energetic evening saw Oscar host Neil Patrick Harris put on a theatrical performance at the Kodak theatre. Neil, 41, only managed a few jokes before bringing out his jazz hands, performing a hilarious original song - Moving Pictures - about the great and good of Hollywood. Neil's spirited routine - where he was joined by Anna Kendrick and Jack Black - paid tribute to some of Hollywood's best known performances and scenes, and had the star-studded audience. Taking home the first of award of the night was J.K. Simmons for Whiplash - a perhaps unsurprising win considering he has swept the board in the same category this awards season. Best Picture .

"These are the horrific injuries of Syrian civilians who Bashar al-Assad's political rivals say were targeted with phosphorous bombs by the regime. The troubled country’s opposition coalition said yesterday that the President’s forces had dropped the bombs and napalm on civilians in rural Aleppo on Monday. It comes as Turkey sent extra aid workers trained to identify and decontaminate chemical weapons victims to its border with Syria after an apparent poison gas attack in Damascus a week ago. Scroll down for video (WARNING Graphic) Response: United Nations chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks carry samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus . Serious injuries: Civilians were taken to Syrian border hospitals after the opposition claimed that the al-Assad regime had used napalm and white phosphorous bombs on a student population in Aleppo . Probe: United Nations arms experts visit a clinic as they inspect the site where rockets had fallen in the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta during an investigation into a suspected chemical weapons strike . Care: A member of the UN investigation team takes samples of sands near a part of a missile likely to be one of the chemical rockets according to activists, in the Damascus countryside of Ain Terma, Syria . ‘We have increased our measures . significantly since last week, to be prepared particularly in case of a . chemical attack,’ said Mustafa Aydogdu, of the Disaster and Emergency . Management Directorate. ‘We . have experts who could deal with chemical attacks and we have deployed . almost all of them in Kilis, Hatay and Sanliurfa,’ he added, naming .

Awful: Turkey has sent extra aid workers trained to identify and decontaminate chemical weapons victims to its border with Syria after an apparent poison gas attack in Damascus a week ago . Claims: The troubled country's opposition coalition said yesterday that the President's forces had dropped the bombs and napalm on civilians in rural Aleppo on Monday . Suffering: A woman (right) affected by what activists said appeared to be a gas attack is led to a team of UN chemical weapons experts (left) for checking during the team's visit to a site of an alleged attack in Damascus . Investigating A United Nations chemical weapons expert wearing a gas mask carries samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus . Wreckage: Syrians walk in a heavily damaged street in the country's eastern town of Deir Ezzor . ‘We can't say at this stage that these burns are due to a chemical attack,’ he added. White phosphorus is a toxic substance used in industry to manufacture chemicals used in fertilisers and cleaning compounds. It can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. It causes skin to melt away from the bone and can break down a victim's jawbone. The substance can also stick to clothing or on the skin and continues to burn unchecked as particles are exposed to air. Particles scorch through layers of tissue until their oxygen supply is cut off. Doctors say the best way to treat the burns is by keeping oxygen away from the wound by ensuring it is wet, and surgically remove all the phosphorous particles. ‘We have heard about the use of phosphorus but I can't confirm as yet that people who have been subject to a chemical attack have crossed into Turkey.’ United Nations chemical weapons investigators crossed Syria's front line into rebel-held territory today for a second visit to the scene of the poison gas attack near Damascus. US President Barack Obama and his European and Middle East allies have blamed Mr Assad for last week's killing of hundreds of civilians and are drawing up plans for punitive military action. Turkey has emerged as one of Mr Assad's most vocal critics and has been a staunch supporter of the rebels. It has spent £1.3billion sheltering refugees, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said. Turkey's near two dozen camps are home to about 200,000 refugees, Mr Aydogdu said, while the rest live in rented accommodation in border cities. He said new capacity was being built, adding: ‘We can host another 20,000 people in our camp in Viransehir, near the border. There is no capacity problem at this stage.’","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Last week, a stranger told me how sexy I was. Or rather, he told my friend Matthew, with whom I was having dinner. ‘Do you know how lucky you are to have such an attractive companion?’ the man asked him while I was at the bar. Immediately, Matthew puffed up to twice his size — but I could scarcely believe my ears. Surely they didn’t mean me? At the age of 70? Perhaps this man needed his eyesight testing. Scroll down for video . Liz, 70, says that in the last ten years she's been besieged by dating offers from men in her own age group (Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin in It's Complicated) Still, I was secretly thrilled. Who wouldn’t be? No one ever paid me such a compliment when I was younger and had the looks to deserve it; yet now, someone was honestly wowed by me. I felt great. Sexy, even. I’m not exaggerating when I say this wasn’t an isolated incident. Over the past ten years, since my partner died, I have been besieged by dating offers from men in my age group. And not just dating. Far from thinking that it’s not possible to have a fulfilling sex life in later life, I have to tell you I’m very satisfied. While I am still single, I do have a male friend (not Matthew) whom I see every now and then. Our relationship is not exactly romantic, but it is certainly red-blooded. In today’s rather coy slang, it is a ‘friendship with benefits’. Sex is in no way off the agenda because of my age. Yes, it really is true — like many women my age, at 70 I’m sexier than ever. Even Matthew later told me that he was in complete agreement with the stranger. ‘It’s true,’ he insisted, as I suppose he felt he had to. ‘You really haven’t lost your sex appeal.’ Traditionally, sexiness is a short-lived commodity, fleetingly bestowed upon the young and quickly lost — like sand running through your fingers. Liz (pictured) says she sees women in their 60s and 70s everywhere who still think, 'look and act sexy' In our 70s, goes the received wisdom, we become old crones and ‘little old ladies’ living out our days in a care home or alone in a one-bedroom flat with only a cat for company. We are grannies or aged spinsters, a burden to the NHS and even to our families. For someone of my age, sex appeal is supposed to be a distant memory. Yet it simply isn’t true. When I look around me, I see dozens of women in their 60s and 70s who still think, look and act sexy. Indeed, this is a generation that refuses to accept the passing of sexiness; that rejects the notion we’re past our prime the moment we pick up a pension. Could it be, in fact, that we’re just coming into it? This is such a new and radical thought that it requires a significant culture change. But — and it’s a big but — it doesn’t just happen by itself. In my opinion, sexiness at our age has to be worked at. We might not be crones, but gone are the days when we can walk into a room with unbrushed hair, wearing a tacky T-shirt and flip-flops. That works for gorgeous 20-year-olds, but not for us. After dinner, I talked about this at length with Matthew, who is a psychologist and himself over 70. And, while his views may verge on stuffy, they do come from the horse’s mouth. ‘In my view, all older women should dye their hair because grey or white immediately says: “You’re old, you’re past it.” It says you don’t care any more,’ he says. ‘And most men, including myself, are not interested in a woman who doesn’t care what she looks like.’ Liz says that celebrities like Tina Turner (pictured in 1969) show that older people can still be sexy . And yes, we do have to submit to the pedicurist and manicurist, and wear make-up all the time. In order to keep the old chassis more or less on the road, we must polish it and buff it up. ‘You also have to smile,’ says Matthew. ‘A young person can get away with looking moody, but there is nothing worse than a miserable old person.’ In fact, I admit to keeping several High Street beauty shops more or less in business these days. The local nail salon, brow bar, tanning shop and even the dentist thrive on my custom. I go to the gym, too, for while it might be possible to be sexy and overweight in your 20s, no one is going to ask for your number if you look flabby at 70. Men will think your heart is about to give out, and the only new relationship you’ll forge is with a cardiac surgeon. Cher, who is 68, (pictured in 2013) is an example of how women who are nearly 70 can have the energy and vibrancy that make them sexy . I’m afraid to say that a good figure at this age requires an intense effort — but it’s worth every moment on the cross-trainer. At least nowadays there are gyms that cater for this level of vanity. It’s also true that I have had some work done: a facelift five years ago that has held up reasonably well and removed a lot of the ‘old lady’ look. While this might be cheating, at £12,000 it certainly wasn’t cheap. In any case, I don’t regret it and am considering a tummy tuck, too — though whether I can put myself through the expense and trauma, not to mention the scarring, remains to be seen. I don’t have any particular beauty regime. Products by Simple have always seemed to me as good as anything more expensive. Hands are a perennial problem, and over the years I have tried every kind of hand cream, from cheap to pricey to really very dear indeed — and none seem to make any difference. Same with the neck. Once again, the only real solution is a neck lift. And as for the decolletage: well, just don’t have too much on show. Yes, it all takes more time and effort every year. And, of course, I sound extraordinarily vain. I also never wear flat shoes, except trainers for the gym. But really it is about attitude — and I am certain that is what my admirer at dinner picked up on. I looked animated and lively and fun to be with — perhaps because I was dining with a relatively new friend rather than a grotty old husband of 50 years (I’m sure that helped, in any case). Energy and vibrancy are probably the sexiest qualities of all in older people. Look at Tina Turner, who is 75, and Cher, nudging 70. Look at the way they project and light up a stage — they are at least as sexy as they were 30, 40, even 50, years ago. Cosmetic surgery has helped them, too, but it’s their lust for life that has truly kept them hot. And then there is the fantastic former ballerina Dame Gillian Lynne, still with a lithe dancer’s body and working at the age of 89. I am not the only one enjoying herself so thoroughly at this late(ish) point in life. Recently, a 70-something girlfriend confessed that she was having a torrid affair with a married man, which, at any age, is morally dubious and extremely exciting. Liz also refers to former ballerina Dame Gillian Lynne (pictured in 2014) who still has a lithe dancer’s body and is working at the age of 89 . Because of this, she knows there is no future in the relationship and, in any case, he lives abroad so they cannot meet very often. But he is so besotted with her that he Skypes or phones at least five times a day, and is always emailing her love poems he has written. He is distraught when he cannot make contact, and tells her she is the sexiest woman he’s ever met. I wish I could say that she didn’t go to enormous efforts to remain attractive — but the opposite is true. I have never seen her without full make-up, manicured nails and high heels. She also always exudes a delicious but subtle aura of expensive scent — another little touch older women often forget. No wonder her lover can’t wait to get on a plane and book a five-star hotel. Yes, we 70-year-olds of today are sexy, youthful and raring to go. Now all we’re waiting for is men of the same age to catch up.","Liz Hodgkinson says she's been 'besieged by dating offers' recently .

"CBS paid tribute to veteran correspondent Bob Simon on Sunday night with a special hour-long episode which celebrated his life and career . CBS paid tribute to veteran correspondent Bob Simon last night with a special hour-long episode which celebrated his life and career. Presented by Steve Kroft, the special 60 Minutes Presents charted   Simon's 47-year career presenting from war zones and disasters across the world. The veteran reporter was killed in a car crash in New York City 12 days ago. On the show Simon was remembered for having travelled to more than 130 different countries to report on every possible type of news. 'It was his love of adventure and the search for new experiences that drove him to explore exotic and often dangerous places,' Kroft said. Simon, 73, who survived being held in an Iraqi prison under the regime of Saddam Hussein and was one of the last reporters to leave Saigon during the Vietnam War, died following the crash on Manhattan's West Side Highway. Kroft said: 'Tonight, we remember and celebrate the life and extraordinary career of our friend and colleague Bob Simon. 'He spent 47 years covering the world for CBS News and 60 Minutes and survived dozens of wars and other calamities. 'He died 11 days ago in a New York City traffic accident not far from this studio. 'The irony would not have been lost on Bob. Irony was one of his favorite journalistic devices. 'He was a brilliant combination of sophistication and street smarts, who liked to tell people he was just a Jewish kid from the Bronx. 'He didn't tell you that he was also Phi Beta Kappa, and had been a Fulbright scholar, or that he came to become television's quintessential foreign correspondent.' The show looked at three of Simon's most memorable stories: The Shame of Srebrenica, which looked at the slaughter by Serb troops of more than 8,000 Muslim civilians in that Bosnian town and the role of Dutch U.N Peacekeepers; The Sea Gypsies, about a small community who survived the 2004 Asian Tsunami; and The Recyclers, about a town built on a rubbish dump in Paraguay. Leslie Stahl and Steve Kroft (above) talked about Simon and his daughter in an interview about their friend . Colleague Lesley Stahl said: 'It wasn't an easy choice to pick only three, given the hundreds of stories he did, and the range of subjects he took on. 'He combined bravery, an eye for the telling detail and, at times, a righteous indignation at war's folly and its consequences.' Scott Pelley said: 'Bob Simon was always ready for an adventure - a chance to travel somewhere he'd never seen and tell us all about it. 'He had a gift for finding the surprising, even the magical, in the most unexpected places.' Simon was born on May 29, 1941, in the Bronx, New York City, and graduated from Brandeis University in 1962, receiving a degree in history. He started his 47-year career with CBS News in 1967. Two years later, Simon joined the network's foreign bureaus, where he was until 1981 when he became the State Department correspondent. He went on to report from war zones in Portugal, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, the Persian Gulf, and Yugoslavia. He covered the conflict in Northern Ireland and U.S. military actions in Grenada, Somalia and Haiti. Simon, reporting from the back of a helicopter, during the Vietnam War (left) and (right) in his final piece . Simon was described by his 60 Minutes producer as a 'reporter's reporter' and his coverage and insight into some of the world's most hostile regions brought numerous accolades including 27 Emmys and four Peabody Awards. Simon joined CBS News as a reporter and assignment editor, covering campus unrest and inner-city riots. He also worked in CBS' Tel Aviv bureau from 1977 to 1981 and in Washington, D.C., as its Department of State correspondent. He got his start as a globe-trotting war correspondent in Vietnam. During one broadcast from the war zone, Simon reported from the back of a helicopter on its way to collect an American with shrapnel wounds. Simon's and his wife Françoise in an undated picture - they had one daughter, Tanya, and one grandson . He covered the length of the Vietnam War and was on one of last helicopters out of Saigon in 1975 when the U.S. withdrew troops. In 1987, he was made chief Middle East correspondent for CBS News. At the beginning of the Persian-Gulf war in January 1991, he was captured with colleagues by Iraqi forces. The team spent 40 days in a prison of Iraqi despot Saddam Hussein. He was interrogated, beaten with canes and truncheons, and starved by his Iraqi captors. He would later recount his story in the book Forty Days. Following his ordeal, he returned to Iraq in January 1993 to cover the U.S. bombing of the country. He was made the Middle East correspondent for CBS News in 1987 - he is pictured here in Israel . Simon after he was released from 40 days of captivity by Iraqi forces during the first Iraq War in 1991 . Simon won numerous awards, including his fourth Peabody and an Emmy for his story from Central Africa on the world's only all-black symphony in 2012. Another story about an orchestra in Paraguay, one whose poor members constructed their instruments from trash, won him his 27th Emmy, perhaps the most held by a journalist for field reporting, CBS said. He also won the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award, for 'Shame of Srebrenica,' a '60 Minutes II' report on genocide during the Bosnian War. His range was broad - from reporting on the Lost Boys of Sudan during the 1987 civil war to more recently, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster which was hit by a tsunami triggered by a 9.0 earthquake. 'It's a terrible loss for all of us at CBS News,' said 60 Minutes Executive Producer Jeff Fager. 'It is such a tragedy made worse because we lost him in a car accident, a man who has escaped more difficult situations than almost any journalist in modern times.' 'Bob was a reporter's reporter. He was driven by a natural curiosity that took him all over the world covering every kind of story imaginable.' Bill Whitaker added: 'Bob Simon's great passion - apart from his family and good writing - was music. 'He delighted particularly in opera, but a symphony in Kinshasa, a young conductor in Caracas or a rap star from Brooklyn were all worthy of Bob's attention, and in his judgment, ours.' Simon’s final reporting piece for CBS was a collaboration between him and his daughter, Tanya, who also works for the network. It was about Ebola and aired last Sunday.

"Rachel Reeves: Labour frontbencher is set for a Cabinet role if Ed Miliband wins the election in May . Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves today hit back at claims she could not handle being in the Cabinet while having a baby. She hopes to become Work and Pensions Secretary if Ed Miliband wins power in May. But she is due to have her second baby just five weeks later, on 15 June, and will begin her maternity leave before that. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell questioned whether becoming a mother means she will be able to give her job her 'full attention'. But Miss Reeves rejected the suggestion, writing on Twitter: '300,000 women a year take maternity leave but Andrew Rosindell thinks can't do big job & be a mum. Tory women problem?' The row erupted after Miss Reeves, 36, said she believes she would have time to abolish the housing benefit under-occupancy charge – known as the 'bedroom tax' – before she goes on maternity leave until September. 'Yes. I'm having a child, and I shall be on maternity leave for the early weeks and months of the next government,' she said in an interview at the weekend. She added that she had already planned her first moves if Labour is in government and she takes over at Work and Pensions. 'The first thing I would do is to abolish the bedroom tax,' she said, referring to the Coalition's controversial policy of cutting housing benefit for council tenants with a spare room so their rent is not fully covered, meaning they have to pay the shortfall or move. 'That's something I can do really quickly. My baby's due in June, and I want to cancel the bedroom tax before I go on maternity leave. That would be a great start for when I come back in September.' Despite her heavy workload, Miss Reeves, who is married to civil servant Nick Joicey, does not have a nanny or any formal childcare and mainly relies on her mother and aunt. Speaking about her childcare arrangements, she added: 'I do make sure I get things done; that I've sorted out the shopping and that there's food in the fridge.' Miss Reeves, a fast-rising Labour star since she was elected in 2010, has been tipped as a successor to Ed Miliband as Labour leader. She is currently work and pensions spokesman, shadowing Iain Duncan Smith. Miss Reeves took to Twitter to hit back at criticism of the idea of taking maternity leave from the Cabinet . But in an interview at the weekend, the Leeds West MP, who has a one-year-old daughter, ruled herself out of taking over if Labour loses the election. 'I think Ed is going to win and I hope that I will be in his first Cabinet, so that's not a scenario I have given any thought to,' she said. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said last night: 'I don't want to say someone who is having a baby is not eligible to be a Cabinet minister, but I certainly think perhaps the demands of that particular job will require someone to give it their full attention. 'I don't expect Rachel Reeves to be in the Cabinet after the election because I expect the Conservatives to win, but clearly people need to be put in the positions they can handle.' David Cameron's official spokesman also dismissed suggestions that pregnant women should not be appointed to the Cabinet. Asked whether the Prime Minister believed a pregnant woman could serve in the Cabinet, the spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'Why on Earth not?' The spokesman added: 'The Prime Minister's views around maternity leave (entitlements) is that they are universal, they apply to everyone and it is entirely a matter for individual families to take the decisions that they think are right for them, and the Government's job is to support them in those decisions they take.' Next in line? Miss Reeves, a fast-rising Labour star since she was elected in 2010, has been tipped as a successor to Ed Miliband, left,  as Labour leader. But Tory MP Andrew Rosindell questioned whether she could give the job her full attention . Miss Reeves is expected to be Labour's public face of the General Election campaign with regular TV appearances. She has been pushed forward by Mr Miliband, becoming shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011, before being promoted to shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013. After studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, state-educated Miss Reeves's first job was as an economist at the Bank of England. She took five months' maternity leave from Parliament after her first child was born in March 2013, returning to work in early September after the summer recess. A week after her return, she faced embarrassment following an appearance on BBC2's Newsnight when its editor Ian Katz sent a tweet calling her 'boring snoring Rachel Reeves'. He had intended it as a private direct message but instead it was tweeted publicly. At the time, Miss Reeves said she was particularly aggrieved about the comment because she had agreed to be interviewed even though she had a new baby. She said: 'I thought, I've just been on your programme at 11 o'clock at night, I've got a tiny baby at home, I could have been at home. I just felt humiliated.' Liberal Democrat equalities minister Jo Swinson was criticised last year for taking six months' maternity leave. She complained of the lack of support for mothers, such as 'bizarre' rulings banning MPs from taking babies through the voting lobby. Miss Swinson said new mothers may need to breastfeed during all night votes and debates. 'I hardly think it would be too much of a disruption,' she said. 'You can take a sword through there but you can't a baby. I think we need to get away from this guilt culture in terms of judging other people's decisions as parents.' Desperate Ed Miliband brings back Two Jags . By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail . Veteran: John Prescott is to return to frontline politics as a climate change adviser to Ed Miliband . John Prescott is to return to frontline politics as a climate change adviser to Ed Miliband. But the move, widely seen as an attempt by the Labour leader to fend off the threat of Ukip by shoring up working-class votes, was greeted with widespread derision. The appointment of Lord Prescott – dubbed Two Jags – came as a second poll in a week put the Tories ahead of Labour. The Opinium survey for the Observer had the Conservatives up two points on 35 per cent and Labour down two on 33. Senior Labour figures admitted Lord Prescott, 76, would play a significant campaigning role ahead of the election. The appointment of the veteran bruiser – during the 2001 election campaign he famously punched a protester who threw an egg at him in North Wales – came as a surprise. He recently criticised Mr Miliband's 'far too timid' approach. 'He might as well have said at the end of his conference speech, 'Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition',' Lord Prescott said in October. He was deputy leader of the Labour Party for 13 years and deputy Prime Minister under Tony Blair until he resigned in 2007. He earned the sobriquet Two Jags after it emerged he owned one and had a second as his ministerial car. In 1999, he was criticised for driving the 200 yards from his hotel to the Labour Party conference venue. He blamed the need to protect his wife Pauline's hair. In 2006 he took a chauffeur-driven Jaguar the 200 yards from his hotel to speak on global warming at a US conference At the time he said he was 'fully focused' on saving the planet. That year it also emerged that he had a two-year affair with his secretary Tracey Temple, a divorcee 24 years his junior. On BBC1's Andrew Marr show yesterday, former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell denied Lord Prescott's return was 'terrifying' but admitted Mr Miliband's personal poll ratings were 'not good'. Former Blair aide Matthew Taylor told Sky News that Lord Prescott was 'probably past the stage of punching people'. Mr Miliband said he was bringing back the veteran because he 'knows how to knock heads together'. Lord Prescott will advise him ahead of the UN climate change conference in Paris later this year, he said. Lord Prescott was the lead EU negotiator during the talks which led to the 1997 Kyoto agreement on reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Labour foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said Lord Prescott was one of the party's strongest campaigners. He said: 'The role and brief that John's been given right now is to focus on climate change but I fully expect that as well as that policy role, he'll continue to support the Labour campaign in the months ahead.' Tory MP Nigel Mills said: 'So, Labour appoints the man who spent his ministerial career swanning around in two gas-guzzling Jaguars to be their adviser on climate change? Another dud appointment from weak Ed Miliband who's got a man who crashed the economy running the shadow Treasury and a deputy leader who thinks the way to attract the female vote is daubing her campaign material in pink.' Ukip's Nigel Farage mocked the appointment, telling Radio 4: 'I think they're a bit short of talent.' Yesterday's Opinium Poll shows Labour has fallen 11 points since the end of 2012. It follows an ICM poll for the Guardian which put the Tories on 36 per cent and Labour on 32. Opinium's Adam Drummond said the recovering economy was boosting the Coalition's ratings.","Miss Reeves hopes to become Work and Pensions Secretary if Labour wins .

"Campaigners in the Lake District are fighting plans for a proposed 'eyesore' fence which they say will spoil the national park and ruin its chances of becoming a world heritage site. Water company United Utilities wants to erect the six-mile fence in open land above Thirlmere, in a bid to keep out sheep from the three-square-mile area. They say 'over-grazing' by the sheep has eroded the peat, causing it to wash down the hill and discolour the reservoir water. Scroll down for video . Campaigners in the Lake District are fighting a proposed six-mile fence above Thirlmere reservoir (pictured) which they say will spoil the national park and ruin its chances of becoming a world heritage site . This map shows the proposed fence line which United Utilities believes will improve the reservoir water . But the Open Spaces Society and the Friends of the Lake District are fighting the scheme, saying the fence will be an eyesore on the landscape and will prevent walkers from roaming freely across the fells. They also fear the barrier could undermine the government's bid to make the Lake District a world heritage site, something which will be considered by Unesco's committee  in June 2017. Now Miriam O'Reilly has waded into the debate, warning the move could open the floodgates for more development on open land in the national park. 'It would take away the right of hill farmers to graze their animals there, but would also hinder hill walkers who have enjoyed the landscape for centuries,' she told The Times. Miriam O'Reilly, the former Countryfile presenter, has joined campaign groups in opposing the plans . She added that it would not only 'destroy the look of the landscape' but would also 'prevent people from roaming freely'. The proposal, which is due to be considered by the government's Planning Inspectorate later this year, said the fence would be temporarily erected for 15 years. United Utilities said the move is needed to stop peat entering Thirlmere and contaminating the reservoir, which is one of the North West’s most significant sources of public drinking water. It also promised that access to walkers would not be hampered and that it would only prevent the free movement of livestock. Gates will be included at regular intervals, the plan says. But Ian Brodie, who represents OSS, said the fence was not 'temporary' because it would be in place for 15 years. He said: ‘The proposed fence will be one of the greatest threats the Lake District has faced to the traditional openness and freedom of the fells. 'It will impact on many walkers each year and it appears to run contrary to the principles of the bid for World Heritage inscription which United Utilities are supposedly supporting.’ Rory Stewart, MP for Penrith and The Border, has also joined the campaign, saying the fence would jeopordise 'that combination of wild and pastoral that inspired Wordsworth'. But biodiversity officer John Gorst, from United Utilites, said: 'It absolutely isn't our intention to hamper people's access or enjoyment but what many probably don't realise is that, although beautiful, the Thirlmere valley is not working the way nature intended. 'We're trying to encourage natural vegetation which has been over-grazed for many years to regenerate and hopefully restore habitats like blanket bog, which is natural to the valley.' He added: 'Unfortunately without a fence, it’s hard to see how we can help restore the land.'","United Utilities wants a fence above Thirlmere reservoir to keep out sheep .

"Season after season, Burberry's Christopher Bailey unveils the most coveted catwalk collection - and his AW15 womenswear show today was no different. Named Patchwork, Pattern & Prints, Burberry is bringing back bohemian style for AW15 with a print-filled show nostalgic of the 70s. The show at Kensington Gardens opened with the dulcet tones of singer-songwriter Clare Maguire, who had written a song specifically for the show. Scroll down for video . Named Patchwork, Pattern & Prints, Burberry is bringing back bohemian style for AW15 with a print-filled show nostalgic of the 70s closed by hot young models Malaika Firth and Edie Campbell . Supermodels Cara Delevingne, Jourdan Dunn, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell may have taken a break from the catwalk to admire the collection from the front row but that wasn't to say Bailey didn't tap the rest of the cool young Brit pack. Whilst last season's favourite Suki Waterhouse was partying at the Oscars in Los Angeles with beau Bradley Cooper, Malaika Firth closed the show with aplomb. Mosaic-encrusted tops,  patchwork leggings and a new take on the classic trench rocked the runway . The collection also included several floaty peasant style dresses that finished below the knee . Coats were trimmed with the softest shearling and the bucket bag came in leopard or decked in fringing . Following closely behind was the biggest clothes horses in the business, Sam Rollinson, Edie Campbell and Matilda Lowther, all dressed head-to-toe in the British heritage label's latest offering. This time last year, Bailey introduced the poncho - and a who's who of fashion wore their personalised versions all season long. Known for his ability to reinvent trends time and time again, he updated it for AW15 with the help of some fashionable fringing - and Kate Moss arrived wearing a black version before it had even hit the runway. The collection saw some of Christopher Bailey's signature graphic prints that he has favoured over the past few seasons of the Burberry Prorsum catwalk . Tassels were omnipresent on Bailey's runway and patchwork print boots were seen on the runway and on the front row (worn by none other than Cara Delevingne) The collection carried a folklore feel with models' dainty outfits completed with pompoms round the wrist . The poncho has become a new classic for the brand with this season seeing embellishment to the capes . The soft outline was first seen at the fashion house a year ago with the monogrammed blankets . Suede and leather fringing was a theme throughout the line and even the models' shoes were complete with a tasseled edging . For the braver Burberry girl full-length fringing was seen on several models in tan and plum shades . Mosaic-encrusted tops and dresses were worn with black waistcoats and fringed booties sashayed down the runway . The designer Christopher Bailey takes a bow after presenting his AW15 collection . Burberry's new arm candy, the bucket bag, was given a fringed makeover, as were the brand's winter ponytail booties. The staple trench, meanwhile, came with paisley prints in blossom hues, while teal and olive maxi dresses made a comeback and were worn with the tiniest of waistcoats. Mosaic-encrusted tops, quilted floral jackets, and patchwork leggings rocked the runway, with the occasional injection of leopard-print making a graphic statement. Today's show, which closed with a shower of metallic confetti, was boho Burberry at its absolute best.

"An investment bank may pay staff their bonuses early in order to avoid extra taxes that Labour have pledged to bring in, it was reported last night. Rothschild is believed to be considering the move after Ed Balls promised to introduce a windfall tax on bankers' bonuses in the first year of the next parliament if Labour comes to power. The shadow chancellor has threatened to repeat the move – which Labour say will raise up to £2billion – the following year if bankers do not show more restraint on pay. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls (pictured) has promised to introduce a windfall tax on bankers' bonuses if Labour wins the election in May . Rothschild would normally pay its staff their bonus relating to performance for 2014 in June this year. But two people familiar with the bank's thinking have revealed the bank is considering bringing the pay-out forward to before the next general election, according to the Financial Times. The bank has officially declined to comment. In a statement, it said: 'Rothschild annually distributes a percentage of its profits for the year to its staff as a profit share. 'The payment date of this distribution varies across divisions and geographies.' Under the Labour plan, bonuses paid to bankers would be taxed to fund the party's compulsory jobs gua5rantee to get young people into work. Mr Balls said last year: 'After the global banking crisis and with bank bonuses soaring again this year, it's fair to pay for our jobs plan with a repeat of Labour's tax on bank bonuses. We need a recovery for the many, not just a few at the top.' It comes after it was revealed this weekend that high street banks are to pay out bonuses worth more than £5billion - with the chief executives in line for millions of pounds next week. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC's chief executive, is in line for pay and perks of £7.4million, including a bonus of £1.3million. Investment bank Rothschild (pictured in London) is believed to be considering paying the 2014 bonus before the general election, instead of the usual time in June . Despite the recent string of scandals - including tax avoidance at its Swiss private banking arm – it is preparing to reward its top staff with a total bonus pool of £2.2billion. From 2015, banks across the European Union now face tougher constraints on bonuses paid out to senior staff and key risk-takers. These employees at Rothschild – called 'code staff' – shared bonuses of £12million between 50 of them between 2013 and 2014. A final decision on the timing of bonuses is expected to be taken before the Rothschild group's year end on March 31.","Shadow chancellor Ed Balls wants to bring in tax in first year of parliament .

"She has vowed not to let her $127million Powerball win change her - and has even promised to give some of the cash to church. But single mother-of-four Marie Holmes looked to have treated herself to a millionaire makeover as she collected her share of the vast lottery jackpot. The 26-year-old, from Shallotte, North Carolina, was pictured wearing a woollen beanie when she came forward with the lucky ticket, which netted her a lump-sum payment of $127million before taxes. But as she finally stepped forward to claim her winnings, she dazzled with a new hairstyle and smart suit. Scroll down for video . Dazzling: Marie Holmes, looked to have treated herself to a millionaire makeover as she collected her share of the vast lottery jackpot . The 26-year-old, from Shallotte, North Carolina, was pictured wearing a woollen beanie when she came forward with the lucky ticket . Marie Holmes, 26, from Shallotte, North Carolina, made her $127million lottery winnings official on Monday with a press conference for the Education Lottery . Holmes announced her winnings to a local news station earlier this month. But the handing over of the large check makes her winnings official . Holmes, one of three winners of the historic $564million jackpot, announced her winnings to a local news station two weeks ago. But the passing over of the over-sized check at a news conference yesterday made her winnings official. Holmes has said that she hopes to set up college funds for her children, buy a new home, give money to church and to travel - perhaps to Paris, as she's never been outside the United States. Holmes says she gave her mom $15 to buy five tickets on her way to church. She later bought five more. Weeks later, life is very different. She says security accompanies her everywhere. At the news conference, she was flanked by her lawyer and her financial adviser. Holmes and her family live in a trailer in Shallotte, North Carolina — just north of South Carolina on the coast. Winning still 'doesn't feel real', Holmes said at the press conference. 'It's not going to change the person that I am, but it's going to change our situation,' she added. 'It's going to be very fortunate.' The lucky winner said earlier this month that she scared her kids, one of whom has cerebral palsy, after she found out she had won and began screaming that they 'didn't have to struggle anymore'. 'I am humbled and grateful for the opportunities this has created for my family,' she said. Holmes said at the press conference that having the money hasn't hit her yet, and that it still 'doesn't feel real' Holmes said she originally bought five tickets for a total $15 before the lottery was announced. She later bought five more in homes of winning the jackpot . She said at the conference that now she is happy her family won't have to struggle anymore now that she has the money. 'They're going to be able to live a comfortable life,' she said. 'That's everything.' She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children. Her four children, Brayden, Charisma, Andrea and Ebony, are aged from nine months to seven years old. Brayden is believed to suffer from cerebral palsy. Holmes sacrificed her education to care for her four children and took minimum wage jobs to provide for her family. With little or no help from the fathers of her four young children, she has struggled financially for most of her adult life. Holmes has also seen her own father repeatedly jailed and her favorite cousin shot and left paralyzed after a home invasion. Family members  describe Holmes as a loving mother who always put her children first. 'Marie is very grounded and she will know what to do with all that money,' said her uncle William Bryant. 'I'm sure she will want to buy a new home for herself and her kids, but I can't see any extravagant purchases. She's a nice girl who loves her family and loves her church.' Holmes said in the press conference that she can give her kids all that they want now, but she still wants them to live humbly . Family members have said that the mother is a nice and grounded woman who 'always puts her kids first' Holmes has little contact with the two fathers of her four children. The three eldest are with her former high school sweetheart who now lives in California. Her youngest child is with a local man but friends say he is not involved in his daughter's life. Lottery officials said her winning ticket was sold at a convenience store in Shallotte. It is the fourth time that a North Carolina ticket has claimed a Powerball jackpot. In North Carolina, a winner has 180 days from the drawing to claim the prize. The winning numbers were: 11, 13, 25, 39, 54 and the Powerball 19. Holmes's winning line was the fourth of the 'quick picks'. The odds of winning the Powerball are one in 175million. The gas station she bought the ticket at will get $50,000 as a retailer incentive award. Another ticket-holder from the February 11 drawing in Puerto Rico has elected to remain anonymous, while the owner of a winning ticket sold in Texas has not yet come forward. Holmes has been living in the pictured trailer with multiple family members. She hopes to buy a new house for her and her kids with the earnings, but she doesn't know if she'll settle in North Carolina . Before becoming a stay-at-home mom, Holmes, worked at this McDonald's in North Carolina to help her family get by . The Texas Lottery posted on Twitter that one of the winning tickets was sold at Appletree Food Mart in Princeton, a city about 40 miles north of Dallas. It had been nearly a year since a Powerball prize reached the giant number people have come to expect recently. That was last February, when someone won $425.3million. The February 11 jackpot was the third-largest in Powerball history and the fifth-largest U.S. lottery prize. The last time a Powerball jackpot climbed so high was May 2013, when a Florida ticket won a $590.5million prize. The largest payout in U.S. history was to three ticketholders in the Mega Millions game, the other national lottery drawing. That was a $656million prize won in March 2012 by players in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland. In 2012, state officials who run Powerball and Mega Millions changed ticket prices and lowered the odds of winning jackpots in hopes the moves would increase the number of huge prizes and draw more players. The new rules worked, causing jackpots to repeatedly climb to record levels. More than half of the top 10 U.S. jackpots have been reached in the past couple of years.","Marie Holmes, from Shallotte, North Carolina, came forward to a local news station two weeks ago with winning ticket .

"Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Sunday that his state's border with Mexico is so porous that 'more than 20,000' illegal immigrants have crossed it since January 1. The startling claim comes as congressional Republicans are pushing hard against President Obama's 'executive amnesty' plan that would mainstream more than 5 million people who are in the U.S. illegally. 'We all saw what happened on the Texas border last summer, but we need to understand that the problem is not going away,' Abbott said on the CBS show 'Face the Nation.' 'Already this calendar year, since January 1, we have had more than 20,000 people come across the border, apprehended, unauthorized. And so we have an ongoing problem on the border that Congress must step up and solve.' ASTONISHING: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said more than 20,000 illegal immigrants have poured across his state's border with Mexico since January 1, and blames the Obama administration . AWKWARD: Abbott was in the room along with 49 other state governors when President Obama addressed them on Monday . Obama's plan that he announced in November doesn't apply to illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. in the last five years. The president outlined his intentions four months ago and framed them as an effort to reprioritize scarce Homeland Security Department resources in a way that focused more on new border-crossers and less on people the White House sees as otherwise law-abiding residents. 'If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up,' Obama said Nov. 20. But that message hasn't percolated into the communities of Mexicans and Central Americans who are desperate for what they believe is a free ticket to live in America without fear of deportation. That's the deal Obama has offered to a larger but different group of people, including countless hundreds of thousands of adults who have had children after sneaking into the United States. He is also promising them work permits and Social Security numbers, something the GOP fears will be impossible to roll back once it's in place. A federal judge agreed last week, calling a halt to the entire process. At the same time, the Obama administration says it stopped 213,719 people from taking up residence in the U.S. illegally last year. Most, however, get through a loose net of border security that then-governor Rick Perry augmented with his own armed Department of Public Safety officers last year. TEXAS: federal border patrol agents have snagged hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants as they cross the border, but nearly a million live in Texas already . EYE IN THE SKY: Abbott's predecessor Rick Perry put hundreds of Texas Department of Public Safety troops on the front lines to stem the human tide, and hundreds more are coming . Abbott said he will up the ante with 'more than 500 more Department of Public Safety officers, more Texas Rangers, more technology. We are coming out of our own pocket, Texas taxpayers' pockets, to secure the border and doing the job that the federal government must do.' More than 800,000 ilegal immigrants currently live in Texas, though. 'You don't have enough buses to send them back to Mexico, and I don't expect you can put all of them in jail,' CBS host Bob Schieffer asked Abbott on Sunday. 'What are you going to do with them?' 'Well, two things,' the governor said. 'One is, the president himself said as these people were coming across the border that he would repatriate them as soon as possible. So, we need to see whether or not the president himself is going to live up to the commitment that he made.' The second part, he said, is up to federal lawmakers: 'We need Congress to have the latitude to fulfill its responsibility to solve the problem.' House Republicans say they've done thir part, passing a Homeland Security budget that strengthens border controls and zeroes out what they call Obama's 'executive amnesty.' House Speaker John Boehner castigated Senate Democrats this month for blocking the measure on the other side of the U.S. Capitol, saying they need to 'get up off their a** and do something.'","Texas is ground zero for the illegal immigration fight .

"A lawyer representing Las Vegas 'road rage' suspect Erich Nowsch is raising questions about the story the victim's family told police as more details continue to emerge about the case. Conrad Claus, an attorney representing Nowsch, 19, is calling into question whether the shooting of 44-year-old Tammy Meyers was a case of road rage or a neighborhood dispute gone terribly wrong. Nowsch is being held on charges of suspicion of murder, attempted murder and firing a gun from a vehicle after he allegedly shot and killed Meyers just after the mother of four finished giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson. Scroll down for video . A Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department official leads Erich Nowsch, 19, (pictured center) from a car . Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in what initially appeared to be a road-rage incident involving Nowsch . Nowsch (pictured left and right) facces charges of murder, attempted murder and firing a gun from a vehicle . Claus believes the story the Meyers family told the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has changed multiple times and questions the way the family supposedly acted, ABC News reported. He also said a suspect sketch done before Nowsch's arrest does not remotely resemble his client. Nowsch also has a 'strong argument for self-defense,' according to Claus. The lawyer told ABC 13 he has issues with the questioning of his client since police 'allowed him to get high before he surrendered to SWAT teams' and 'the statements he made to police may be inadmissible since he was under the influence of drugs'. A police report giving a more detailed account of the February 12 incident revealed Nowsch didn't tell his friends he was angry about a traffic encounter, but he did think someone was after him. The suspect also said he wasn't driving, a detail which would conflict with the road rage narrative. Conrad Claus, an attorney representing Nowsch, is questioning whether there was any 'road rage' involved . Claust said this sketch of the man who was initially wanted in the shooting looks nothing like his client . Daily Mail Online has learned Nowsch is believed to have been affiliated with a gang called Alpha Block. In a number of his Instagram pictures, he appears to be smoking marijuana . Police said Nowsch told his friends after the shooting he was a passenger in a silver Audi and saw a gun waved at him from a green car in a  school parking lot and thought the occupants were after him. He said: 'Got those kids. 'They were after me, and I got them.' Earlier that night, Ms Meyers had taken her daughter, Kristal, to the school parking lot to practice driving the family's green 1993 Buick Park Avenue sedan. After Kristal tried her skills on some nearby residential streets, Ms Meyers hopped back into the driver's seat at about 10:50pm to drive home. That's when a silver car sped up behind them and then pulled alongside, according to the police report. Kristal told authorities she reached over to honk the car horn as her mother kept driving. The silver car cut in front of them, but Ms Meyers turned down another street. The silver car popped up again, passing in a bike lane next to the curb and spinning out sideways in front of them, forcing the Buick to stop, according to the report. Kristal told police later that a six-foot-tall man got out and warned: 'I'm gonna come back for you and your daughter.' Nowsch is about five-foot-three and 100 pounds. Brandon Meyers, the son of the victim, posted a photo of his Beretta handgun on his Facebook page . Robert Meyers, the husband of the shooting victim, speaks to reporters in front of the family home . Meyers was taken off life support after she failed to recover from the injuries she sustained in the incident . Kristal said her mother hit the gas, sped around the silver car and headed home. The daughter told police she thought she spotted the silver car again before they reached home, where her mother told her to run in and get her 22-year-old brother, Brandon. Brandon told police he grabbed his Beretta 9mm handgun, but told his mother she should call 911. He said he got in the car when she told him to come with her or she was going alone. Claus said he found it odd that Meyers and her daughter would not have gone to the police immediately after being threatened. Ms Meyers then drove to where the silver car had blocked their Buick to show her son, then began heading toward home when they spotted a silver car that sped off. They followed for several blocks, passing the school again, before the silver car stopped diagonally in the road and Brandon  told police someone on the passenger side starting shooting. Ms Meyers backed up and sped toward their home, Brandon told police. As they pulled up, Brandon said he saw headlights approaching and he silver car turned onto their street. Brandon  told police a person leaned out the passenger window and opened fire and he fired back. The silver car drove away and Brandon  found his mother lying on the ground, bleeding from the head and called 911. Nowsch told friends he had been involved in a shooting  and had fired 22 shots at a single location . February 13 - Las Vegas police reveal a mother-of-four is shot during an alleged road rage incident. She was later identified as Tammy Meyers. She was teaching her 15-year-old daughter Kristal to drive at the time. February 15 - Her devastated husband, Robert Meyers, vows to find whoever did this to his wife. He turned off her life support after she failed to recover from her injuries sustained in the incident on Valentine's Day. February 16 -  CCTV of the incident is released by police as they hunt for the alleged killer and his accomplice. Police also disclose a sketch of the suspect and say he is 6ft, mid 20s and 180lbs. February 18 - Questions are raised over whether Nowsch acted in self-defense amid claims Mrs Meyers drove back to her home, dropped her daughter off, grabbed her son Brandon and hunted down the car in question. In response, Mr Meyers insists his son is a hero and not a vigilante. February 19 - Following a tense stand-off with police Eric Nowsch is arrested. Mr Meyers claims he knew the suspect and said he knew the kid was bad. After the incident he claimed he wasn't aware who shot his wife. Added that his wife consoled the youngsters for hours and tried to teach him how to be a man. Later that night, Nowsch told friends he had been involved in a shooting — unloading several shots at one location and 22 shots at a second spot. Nowsch said he thought the people in the car in the school parking lot were looking at him so he called a friend with the silver Audi to come and pick him up, according to the report. He displayed a handgun and .45-caliber ammunition to his friends. Nowsch was questioned five days after the shooting while he was being held in juvenile custody on unrelated charges. Police reported finding six .45-caliber bullet casings at the first shooting location and eight near the Meyers home. The police report doesn't name the driver of the silver Audi. Authorities have said they are looking for another suspect. Ms Meyers and Nowsch knew each other and she counseled him after the death of his father five years ago. Police said they only learned about that personal connection hours before they arrested Nowsch. Claus questioned why the family wouldn't have told the police Ms Meyers was familiar with the suspect.","Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, was shot in the head following an alleged 'road rage' incident on February 12 in Las Vegas, Nevada .

"A Malaysian man has been left in critical condition after he was attacked by a machete-wielding gang at a local cinema for 'looking at them funny'.

Attack: Slightly cross-eyed Osman bin Musa, 20, was leaving a cinema in Malaysia when a group of young men accused him of 'looking at them funny' 'Osama is slightly cross eyed and it does occasionally get people making comments, and usually wears sunglasses,' a friend told local media. 'But we had just come out of the cinema and he did not have them on, and as he walked into the foyer, a man asked him: ""what are you looking at?""' According to witnesses, Mr bin Musa's reluctance to respond as not to antagonise the man, only angered the thug. After first throwing an object at Mr bin Musa, the entire gang attacked him in the foyer. Seconds later, Mr bin Musa can be seen on CCTV being pursued by a man wielding a machete, chopping at him as he runs through the cinema.

"While much of the East Coast is coated in snow, spare a thought for the crew of the French–Italian Halley research station in Antarctica. They are about to be 'locked in' - and will have to survive six months of complete isolation. To make things worse, four months will be in darkness because the Sun never rises above the horizon. Scroll down for video . Called Halley VI, the lab is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. Called Halley VI, it is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym. Called Halley VI, it is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym. A vacuum drainage system keeps water . consumption down, and the ski-clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres . (13 feet) above the level of the ice. The inside of the centre has been . been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the . summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter, when . temperatures at the base drop as low as -56C. It has triple-glazed windows and a . quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to . contemplate the Antarctic environment in peace. This year, ESA-sponsored medical doctor Beth Healey will monitor five experiments that are helping to prepare for long-duration missions to explore our Solar System. 'Living in Concordia is similar in many ways to living in space, where crew are cut off from the world without normal sunlight and live in reduced pressure – Concordia station lies 3200 m above sea level,' says the European Space Agency. 'From searching for life that could survive in these extreme conditions to monitoring how the crew of 13 interact and cope with living in close quarters, Beth will have her hands full as the crew maintain the station and perform Antarctic science for the French and Italian polar institutes.' ESA signed an agreement this month with the British Antarctic Survey to perform two of the five Concordia experiments at their Halley VI station. If this pilot season runs well, ESA will extend the cooperation. Concordia offers ESA scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes. The crew at Halley experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level. Performing the same investigations at Halley will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data: air pressure. Over the next six months, volunteers at Halley and Concordia will record themselves in a video diary and have their social interactions monitored. This is working towards objective computer software that will give clues to an astronaut’s state of mind. The Halley VI centre, a dismantlable research station created for the . British Antarctic Survey by British architects Hugh Broughton, was . nominated for  the World Architecture Festival Awards 2013 . Ask anybody how they feel and most will reply ‘fine’ but, for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking, having an objective second-opinion could be a lifesaver. The system works by analysing small changes in intonation and grammar, as well as charting how often people talk to each other, to develop an idea of how people feel. The second experiment being run at both sites will test how our eyes adapt to four months of outside darkness and artificial lighting. Concordia sunset . David Vaughan, British Antarctic Survey’s director of science, concludes: “We are committed to supporting excellent science in Antarctica in all disciplines. We are hugely excited to be hosting these new experiments that may help prepare for, perhaps, the biggest adventure in history, a manned flight to Mars.” Click here for a full list of ESA’s research at Concordia this year and follow the Concordia blog for updates from the station.

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are seeking to attract more foreign recruits by opening two  English-language schools in the terror group's de facto capital city. Activists working undercover in the ISIS stronghold Raqqa uncovered plans for two schools - one for boys and one for girls - where most lessons will be taught in English, not the local Arabic dialect. The plans are just ISIS' latest attempt to build establish a fully-functioning state within the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq it controls through a campaign of rape, massacre and brutal oppression. Last summer the terror group declared the territory a so-called caliphate and said it as the duty of all Muslims around the world to live under the regime. Since then tens of thousands of foreigners have done just that, with English becoming a lingua franca among the militants and their families. New approach: A poster promoting the schools says that they will cater for children aged between six and 14, and lessons will run between 9am and midday between Saturday and Wednesday . Militants: The schools are just ISIS' latest attempt to build establish a fully-functioning state within the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq it controls through a campaign of rape, massacre and brutal oppression . Details of the two new English language schools were revealed by a local activist named Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi, whose group 'Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently' operate undercover in the city to expose ISIS atrocities and report on local developments in the terror stronghold. He uploaded a photograph to Twitter showing a typed-poster that had been put up informing local fighters that the two schools are soon to open. The poster reads: 'By the grace of Allah we have opened schools for English speaking children. The boys school is named Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi School (formally known as Al Qadhim School) and the girls school is called Aisha School and is located next door'. It then goes to say that the schools cater for children aged between six and 14, and lessons are run between 9am and midday between Saturday and Wednesday. The children therefore have Thursday and Friday as a weekend. Religious lessons, Mathematics and English Language are all taught in English and take up the majority of the day, although a minority of lessons, such as the teaching of Arabic Language and the reading of the Koran are conducted in Arabic. Location: Details of the two schools were revealed by a local activist group 'Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently' who later released this map showing where inside the city the education centres will be located . The poster gives a phone number for parents to call if they are interested in enrolling their children and instructs them to ask for a militant named Abu Muhammad. The purpose of opening English language schools in Raqqa is two-fold - firstly to stop English-speaking families leaving the territory over concerns about their children's education, and secondly to raise a generation of bilingual young men to continue the ISIS reign of terror for years to come. The news comes as Syrian Kurdish forces advanced against Islamic State fighters in two separate attacks in northeastern Syria near the Iraqi border on Sunday, an organisation tracking the war reported, compounding recent losses for the militant group in Syria. The Kurdish YPG militia has been one of Islamic State's toughest enemies in Syria and last month flushed the group out of the town of Kobani with the help of U.S. and allied air support and Iraqi Kurdish reinforcements on the ground. Hasaka province in the northeastern corner of Syria is strategically important in the fight against Islamic State because it borders areas controlled by the group in Iraq. In an attack backed by U.S.-led air strikes, the YPG advanced to within 3 miles of Tel Hamis, an Islamic State-controlled town 22 miles southeast of the city of Qamishli, Kurdish official Nasir Haj Mansour said. The YPG had decided to launch the attack after Islamic State reinforced its positions in the area with foreign fighters. It is the latest example of coordination between the U.S.-led alliance and the YPG in the fight against Islamic State, which has seized wide areas of Syria and Iraq and declared them part of a cross-border 'caliphate'.","Local activists revealed terror group's plans to educate children in English .

"Tracey Jackson was left heartbroken after she discovered that her Tunisian fiancé had married another woman while they were still engaged . A mother-of-two discovered that her Tunisian fiancé had wed another woman when he posted his marriage certificate on Facebook. Tracey Jackson met Atef Khadhraoui, 20 years her junior, on a social networking website. Over the next four years the 48-year-old lavished the 28-year-old with gifts and cash. However, Tracey was left heartbroken when she discovered that he chose to repay her by marrying  another woman – and not telling her. Tracey from Rhyl, Wales, believes he must have used some of her money to fund the secret nuptials with his new wife, although he denies this claim. She says that funding his lifestyle has left her struggling to manage financially. 'I'm convinced he must have spent at least some of my money marrying the other woman. He broke my heart and my bank balance. I'm left in crippling debt from loans.' Tracey first met Atef after messaging him on the dating website, Tagged, in 2009. The couple then began speaking on Skype every night. 'He begged me to go out and see him,' Tracey said. 'But because of a hernia in my bowel, I can't work and receive disability allowance. 'I told him it would take a while for me to save and started putting away £70 from each cheque. Tracey says she had her doubts behind Atef's motives for speaking to her but he was so charming she was easily won round. 'At first part of me did wonder why a young guy like him was interested in me. He just said you can't choose who you fall in love with.' Despite his romantic declarations, Tracey said she was terrified of meeting him in person. 'I've had a colostomy bag since I was 19 and was worried he'd see me as some old biddy,' she explained. During the four years that they were together Tracey gave Atef Khadhraoui £7000. Pictured: Tracey holds some of the receipts from the bank transfers she made to Atef . Tracey's fiancé (pictured) was 20 years her junior but repeatedly told her he loved her . Despite being unable to work Tracey saved up her disability allowance to visit her toyboy in Tunisia. Pictured: Tracey with Atef (right) and his mum (left) on a visit to Tunisia . 'After six months of scrimping I finally had enough money. The first time I went out there he treated me like a princess. He was so tanned and muscular. I knew I'd fallen for him. I told him I couldn't give him children and that he should find a girl his own age but he told me not to talk like that. 'Over the next week, we barely left the bedroom. I really thought I'd hit the jackpot.' After returning to Wales Tracey says she missed him so much she took out a £400 high interest loan so she could fly out again two months later. By doing so it meant that Tracey could not afford Christmas presents for friends and family and had to buy gifts from discount stores for her daughters, Lyndsey, 26, and Victoria, 24. Despite having to make huge sacrifices once Tracey arrived in Tunisia she said it appeared that the effort had been worth it when she was met with a big surprise. Tracey says that at the beginning of their relationship they hardly left the bedroom but she soon noticed that her partner was reluctant to have sex with her . On her second visit to Tunisia, Atef surprised Tracey by proposing to her at his home at a party . 'On my second day out there he arranged a huge surprise party where he proposed. I thought it was soon, but I was swept up in the moment.' 'I did have doubts when I saw Atef slow-dancing with another woman, but he assured me she was just a friend.' Just before leaving her fiancé Tracey was met with more monetary demands that she felt she couldn't refuse. 'Then the day before I left, he told me he had to pay a £300 fine or he would be enrolled in the army. 'He said it would mean we couldn't speak or see each other any more. I was devastated and agreed to split the amount with his parents.' After that, the mother-of-two said her toyboy needed to pay an extra £25 a week to stop him being forced into the military. At the proposal party Tracey says that she noticed Atef slow dancing with another woman but in her state of happiness chose to ignore it . Tracey adapted to Atef's culture whole heartedly, devoting her life to her husband-to-be . Tracey would go without food in order to afford her tickets to Tunisia and soon enough Atef got wind of her devotion to him and began to ask Tracey for money . 'I couldn't stand the thought of not speaking to him, so pretty soon I was giving him £70 a fortnight out of my benefits,' she explained. 'He thought I was rich, but I kept telling him it meant I had to go without. I had to bulk buy discount food and often skip meals. But at the end of the day he was going to be my husband, so what was mine was his. 'I'd send him out gifts too. I bought him trainers, countless mobile phones and aftershave.' It was during a visit to Tunisia in October 2013, after dating for almost four years, that Tracey started to get suspicious. They always stayed at the family home, but this time Atef said they needed to stay in an apartment to give his parents a break. After paying £600 for the week, Tracey said she barely saw her fiancé. 'He stopped wanting to have sex with me and he'd leave me in the flat while he went out. 'It was like he didn't want to be near me, always snapping and being cruel. He'd tell me he had to run errands, then not return for hours. I didn't know the language so I was left stranded indoors.' Despite the warning signs Tracey says she refused to believe that there was anything wrong and continued to pursue the relationship. Atef told Tracey he had to pay a £300 fine to prevent him being enrolled in the army she agreed to split the bill with his parents and continued to fund him while she was back in Wales . Tracey began to notice Atef's behaviour change towards her and soon after received a message from the woman he had danced with at the engagement party claiming she was with Atef . 'I told myself we were going through a rough patch. When the holiday was over and I was back home we still chatted every day. We spoke about our future, our wedding, everything felt back on track.' But just a few weeks later her world came crumbling down when she received a message from a woman on Facebook. 'I logged on and saw that I'd received a private message from a woman called Mariem. 'It said she was with Atef and that he'd been using me for money. Clicking on her profile picture, I felt sick to my stomach. Mariem was the woman who had been slow-dancing with Atef at my engagement party. 'I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare. When I confronted him he sounded so calm and assured me that Mariem was just a silly girl with a crush.' Worse betrayal was yet to come though when Tracey logged on to Facebook a month later, on 14 January this year. 'I hadn't heard from Atef in a while so went on his profile and my jaw dropped in horror. He'd uploaded a new picture - his marriage certificate to Mariem. 'I felt like I'd been thwacked with a baseball bat. My fiancé had married another woman and I'd been utterly clueless. Tracey was horrified to discover that Atef had wed the woman in question after he uploaded an image of their marriage certificate (pictured right) to Facebook . 'I called Atef and asked how he could do this to me and whether he'd used my money to afford his big day. All he did was laugh. It was heartbreaking and humiliating. He never apologised, never gave me any explanation.' Tracey says that she now sees how she was used by her toyboy but has not let it deter her from finding love elsewhere. 'I can't believe I wasted four years of my life with that rat. Sometimes I doubt whether he ever really loved me. Maybe all he ever saw me as was a walking, human cash machine. 'I've added it up and I gave Atef more than £7,000. But I'm determined not to mope. I've met a new Tunisian man who treats me like royalty and never asks for money. 'The complete opposite of Atef Khadharoui. I want to name and shame him, and let the women of the UK know what he's capable of.' When approached by the media, Atef claims that he funded his wedding himself and that he does not wish to hear from his former fiancée. 'Please tell Tracey to forget me. I am married now with my love. 'I don't need Tracey. I paid for my wedding with my money.'","Tracey, 48, met  Atef Khadhraoui, 28, on a social networking website .

"For almost a year after Lindsey Stone was fired, she refused to leave the house. Her former employer, Life (Living Independently Forever) dismissed her in 2012 over a picture that a coworker had taken of her giving the finger at Arlington National Cemetery. The firing of both women came after an ardent online campaign that had flooded Life, which works with 'pretty high-functioning people with learning difficulties,' according to Stone, with emails. In addition to the firing, it left a digital trail of bitter anger against Stone, including a now-unavailable Facebook page 'Fire Lindsey Stone,' which had than 19,000 Likes at one point. Shocking: Lindsey Stone flashed the obscene gesture at Arlington National Cemetery, next to a sign that asked for respect . 'I really became obsessed with reading everything about myself,' Stone told Jon Ronson for the Guardian about tracking online reactions in the days after the photo was discovered. Stone's coworker, who snapped the photo, didn't do anything to restrict the privacy settings on the Facebook folder it was posted in. The photo went viral, and became a lightning rod of angry comments over the disrespect to fallen veterans that the photo represented. 'Lindsey Stone hates the military and hates soldiers who have died in foreign wars', read one comment. 'You should rot in hell,' read another. 'Just pure Evil,' said yet another, in addition to rape and death threats, and demands that she be sent to prison. After the incident, Stone's father called his daughter's behavior 'disgraceful' and said the picture was a 'total lapse of judgment.' Deeply saddened: Lindsey Stone was placed on leave at Life, a community for disabled adults in Cape Cod, before being fired . Peter Stone insisted his daughter 'apologize to everybody' for the obscene gesture, which the 30-year-old made at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in October, next to a sign at the . military cemetery that asked for 'Silence and Respect.' 'It was just a spur of . the moment, total lapse of judgment,' Peter Stone told WCVB-TV. 'She wasn't reacting to the place; . she was reacting to the sign and she apologizes to everybody.' Stone was among eight staff members . that traveled with the group of 40 residents to the nation's capital. Photos from the organization's Facebook page showed residents . touring the White House and the Washington Monument on October 20. An unknown Facebook user, who claimed to be an Iraq War veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, created a page on the social networking site, 'Fire Lindsey Stone.' The page, which was started on Monday, had the stated intent to 'only accept termination.' Work event: Stone (pictured in August in an unknown location) posed for the offensive picture when she accompanied 40 residents from the non-profit where she works to the military cemetery in October . Punishment: A Facebook page entitled 'Fire Lindsey Stone' has garnered over 6,000 Likes and Stone's employer said that Stone (right, in an undated photo in Times Square) has been placed on unpaid leave . As part of an experiment in reputation management services, Ronson set up Stone with the company reputation.com to rehabilitate Stone's online image. 'They call me every week, week after week,' according to Stone, and submit social media posts for her approval intended to improve the neutral pages that show up under her Google searches. After almost a year of sending resumes to employers and receiving no response for employment, Stone says she was hired to work with autistic children. 'But I'm terrified' of her employers finding the photo, Stone said, and feels trapped because she can't simply ask whether they've seen it and simply don't care. 'I love this job so much. I love these kids,' she told the Guardian. 'One of the parents paid me a really high compliment the other day.' 'I’ve only been working with her son for a month and she was like, ""The moment I met you, seeing the way you are with my son, and the way you treat people, you were meant to work in this field.""’ 'But what if she found out?' Stone worries. 'Would she feel the same way?' It has affected Stone in profound ways, as the fear of being discovered worked its way into aspects of her social life. 'Since it happened, I haven’t tried to date anybody. How much do you let a new person into your life? Do they already know?' Justified? Stone (pictured left: with her co-worker Jamie Schuh in April) said in a statement that she posed for the picture for her own amusement (pictured right: at a work holiday party in December 2011) Apologies: The woman's father, Peter Stone, insisted that his daughter meant no disrespect . Jim Godsil, CFO of LIFE, had called Stone's behavior 'despicable.' 'We have codes of conduct in terms of . how we expect our employees to act, and this could potentially be in . violation of that,' he said. 'We never meant . to cause any harm or disrespect to anyone, particularly our men and . women in uniform. We realize it was in incredibly poor taste, and are . deeply sorry for the offense we have caused.' But after almost a year of hiding out online, Stone finally Googled herself and found the results relieving.

"The frozen berries at the centre of the Hepatitis A outbreak are now banned from entering Australia as the imported products have so far seen 18 people suffer from the disease. Prime Minister Tony Abbott declared in Question Time at Parliament House on Monday that the Nanna's frozen berries products would undergo 100 percent screening as the fruit is categorised as medium risk. 'They will not ever be allowed for human consumption,' Mr Abbott said, The Daily Telegraph reported, adding that the products would be 'stopped at the border'. The statements are in stark contrast to the Agriculture department's secretary Paul Grimes who told a Senate estimates hearing that there were no changes on surveillance rates for berries 'broadly at this stage', Seven News reported. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott declared   on Monday that the frozen berries will be stopped at the Australian border . Up to 450,000 people may have eaten the frozen berries suspected of transmitting hepatitis A . Meanwhile, Patties Foods says its imported Chinese berries were recalled on health department advice despite a lack of proof from accredited laboratories of a link to the hepatitis A virus (HAV). 'At this point, we have not been provided any remaining consumer product to test from the 13 confirmed HAV cases to clinically verify there is indeed a link with the Nanna's Mixed Berries,' managing director and chief executive Stephen Chaur said in a statement on Friday. Up to 450,000 people may have eaten the frozen berries suspected of transmitting hepatitis A, as four more people were diagnosed with the disease on Saturday. As many as 70,000 packets of the Chinese berries are sold each week in Australia, putting nearly half a million people at risk and sparking concerns over potential future cases. 18 people in total have been diagnosed with hepatitis A, which has an incubation period of seven weeks, leading health experts to believe that more cases will come to light. Mr Chaur insists the company had rigorous testing that went beyond the Australian standards requirement that five per cent of imported fruit containers be tested. 'Patties Foods' documented test regime is amongst the highest, testing 20 per cent of all the containers when they arrive in Australia,' he said. But Mr Chaur said sample testing for microbial and viral markers had been increased to 100 per cent of imported frozen berries from all countries. The company has checked quality control testing documents back to June 2014 and says they're satisfied no biological indicators outside Australian guidelines have been detected. Recalled products are being tested further at laboratories in Australia, Europe and North America with results expected in a fortnight. Production of recalled products has been stopped until the formal results are known. The health department says the source of the virus is still unconfirmed but the berries are the only common exposure in all cases. The Department of Agriculture is asking all companies importing Chinese berries for more information about their sources and food safety management. Food Standards Australia New Zealand will review of the risk status of frozen berries. Approximately two percent of the country's population may have consumed the berries, said Finn Romanes, public health physician and Victorian government medical adviser. 'We are still working on this outbreak and we think that there will be more cases come to light,' Mr Romanes told The Australian. Consumers are being urged not to buy or eat Nanna's Raspberries one kilogram packs, Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries one kilogram packs and 300 and 500 gram packs of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. While only the Nanna's Mixed Berries product has been linked with the outbreak, and the other products have been recalled as a precaution, a Health Department spokesperson said that the source of the disease was still unconfirmed. Four frozen berry products imported by Patties Foods, and sourced from China's Shandong province, were recalled this week due to fears they are linked to the viral disease Hepatitis A . 'However, the berries are the only common exposure for cases,' the Heath Department said in a statement on Saturday. Despite the Federal government refused to release statistics relating to the scare, it has been revealed that three Victorians were the first to contract Hepatitis A, between  Christmas and New Years. The Victorians were all interviewed by health authorities, and found that all three had consumed the berries, corroborating similar findings in NSW. An estimated one in 100 people who have eaten the contaminated berries will develop the disease, a figure which the Federal Health Department labelled as 'worse case scenario'. A river which flows in the Chinese village Jinling in the Shandong province is one of China's most polluted areas, reportedly where frozen berries are grown and packed before they are imported and sold in Australian stores . The Department of Agriculture is contacting companies that have imported Chinese berries to find out about the source of the berries and supply chain food safety management systems. Early last week, the Red Cross Blood Service banned those who had eaten the berries from donating blood for two months, but lifted the ban on Saturday when they found the blood supply was not at risk. It has been revealed the frozen berries  are from the Shandong province in east China, the Daily Telegraph reports. Cities and villages in Shandong are reportedly plagued by chemical and industrial waste pollution, with farming land laying adjacent to factories and petrochemical plants. One river running through the village of Jinling is so polluted by nearby chemical factories that the water is red coloured and has a foul smell, according to local Chinese reports. The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City, according to the Epoch Times. The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City . In previous reports, there have been claims that the company releases chemical distribution into the river, which was once sparkly clear but has now visibly been contaminated and also emanates a stench. Residents also say there's a 'cancer virus' floating around the village as cancer is quite common in the town. This comes as reports emerged that health tests weren't conducted on any frozen berry products imported to Australia while similar goods have been tied to hepatitis breakout in North America and Europe,The Australian reports.","Tony Abott declares the frozen berries will be stopped at Australian border .

"Japan's crown prince has warned in a rare public statement that his country must remember World War II 'correctly'. The unusual intervention comes as politicians fight to downplay the country's historic war crimes, which include sex slavery, torture and mass killings. Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, believes Japan should tell twentieth-century history more sympathetically. Japan's crown prince Naruhito is pictured during a state visit to Neuchatel, Switzerland, on June 19 last year . Historians agree that up to 200,000 women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese during World War II. The women are thought to be predominantly from Korea. In many cases, they were lured with promises of work in factories or restaurants. But once they were recruited, the women were forced to stay in 'comfort stations' and work as organised prostitutes. Research suggests that 75 per cent of 'comfort women' died and others were left infertile or suffering from sexually transmitted diseases. Some were beaten and killed by officers. Prime Minister Abe once said: 'There is no evidence to prove there was coercion, nothing to support it.' But Naruhito, who released the comments on his 55th birthday, said they must remember the miserable experience. He said: 'Today when memories of war are set to fade, I reckon it is important to look back on our past with modesty and pass down correctly the miserable experience and the historic path Japan took from the generation who know the war to the generation who don't. 'It was very painful that many precious lives were lost, many people suffered and felt deep sorrow in the world including in Japan. 'It is important that we never forget people who died in the war... (and we must) deepen our appreciation for our past so as not to repeat the horrors of war and to foster a love of peace.' Japan is thought to have killed between three and ten million people during the war, mainly Chinese. They also conducted the surprise Pearl Harbour attack on a US Navy base in 1941, leading to the US declaring war on them. Historians believe Japanese soldiers also tortured prisoners of war and forced them to go through amputations without anesthesia as a form of biological testing. Prime Minister Abe's controversial views have already roiled relations with China and South Korea, as well as causing unease in America. He recently appointed a 16-member panel to advise him on a statement he is set to make later this year to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's surrender. Abe has said he will largely stand by Tokyo's previous apologies but speculation is mounting that he will seek to downplay the country's involvement in sexual slavery. Known as the 'comfort women' system, mainstream historians agree that up to 200,000 women, predominantly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery during WWII. Japanese soldiers point their bayonets at Chinese civilians in Nanjing in 1937. Some Japanese deny that the massacre, in which up to 300,000 Chinese were killed, ever happened . Japan's crown prince Naruhito poses for a photo at his residence inside the Togu Palace in Tokyo on February 11 . Right-wing Japanese insist there is no documentary proof that the Japanese state or its military were involved in the system and reject official guilt. That position angers South Korea and China and both countries will be carefully watching any official pronouncement on the war. While Japan's newspapers remained staid in their coverage of Naruhito's comments, social media users leapt on them. One user, named @Kirokuro, tweeted: 'This definitely contains a warning against Shinzo Abe, doesn't it?' Another, @kazu_w50, wrote: 'It is a regular recognition (of history), but these comments by the crown prince stand out because Prime Minister Abe's views on the constitution and history are outrageous.' China-Japan relations have been strained since the 1937 Nanking Massacre and what China sees as Japan's refusal to acknowledge the extent of what happened there. Japanese soldiers murdered tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of Chinese soldiers and civilians during the Second Sino-Japanese War. They were accused of raping local women and widespread looting. Estimates of the death-toll range from 40,000 to 300,000, but revisionists in Japan have contended it is much lower and even suggested that the event was entirely fabricated. China sees the denial to acknowledge the extent of the massacre and Japan's reluctance to apologise as insensitive.","Crown prince Naruhito said people must remember miserable experience .

So TV presenter Davina McCall was perfectly placed to get on the sugar-free diet bandwagon, with a cookbook detailing how she eventually weaned herself off the sweet stuff. But her book, Davina’s 5 weeks to Sugar-Free, has left readers feeling bitter after several of its recipes were found to be just as sweet as regular treats. Scroll down for video . Bittersweet reaction: Davina McCall, above, released a cookbook detailing how she weaned herself off sugar . Diet experts say several are packed full of sugar – but in the form of natural ingredients such as honey. Reviews on the Amazon website criticised the title as ‘hugely misleading’ with some buyers demanding their money back. Experts at the British Dietetic Association said some of the recipes would warrant a high or a moderate sugar label if they were sold in supermarkets. In the book Miss McCall, 47, advises readers to replace table sugar with honey and maple syrup. She also suggests reducing these over five weeks. One disgruntled buyer wrote on Amazon: ‘Sorry Davina, this is hugely misleading. I am returning this book today.’ Gemma Sampson, of the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘Some of these recipes are not sugar-free or even low in sugar. Miss McCall’s spokesman said: ‘As the title suggests, Five Weeks To Sugar Free offers a 5 week programme to eliminate refined and processed sugar from your diet.

"The race to get self-driving cars on to public roads is now truly on. Volvo has announced it aims to put 100 of its autonomous vehicles on roads as soon as 2017. Members of the public will be put in the driving seats of production-ready cars to test the Drive Me system, which the company claims can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios’. Driving change: Volvo aims to put 100 of its self-driving cars on real roads as soon as 2017, putting members of the public in the driving seats of production-ready cars to test a system that the company claims can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios’ ‘We are entering uncharted territory in the field of autonomous driving,’ said Dr Peter Mertens, senior vice president research and development of Volvo Car Group. ‘Taking the exciting step to a public pilot, with the ambition to enable ordinary people to sit behind the wheel in normal traffic on public roads, has never been done before.’ The trial is set to take place on selected roads in Gothenburg, Sweden and is a collaboration between the auto manufacturer, transport authorities and critically, legislators. Laws governing the driving of autonomous vehicles has restricted other technology trials. The trial is set to take place on selected roads in Gothenburg, Sweden and is a collaboration between the auto manufacturer, transport authorities and critically, legislators. It will use 100 cars fitted with sensors and cameras, which use a cloud-based 3D digital map to guide their journey (illustrated) It is not clear how much the people involved in the trial will have to take control of their vehicles, but it seems unlikely they will be able to chat on a phone, watch a film, read a book (illustrated) or do some work, for example, as the car motors along. But this is the firm's vision for the future . Sensors: Volvo's Drive Me car is fitted with multiple radars, cameras and laser sensors to plot its exact positioning on the road and give the system a 360° view of the car’s surroundings. A network of computers processes the information, which together with GPS, generates a real-time map of moving and stationary objects in the environment. Twelve ultrasonic sensors around the car are used to identify objects close to the vehicle and support autonomous drive at low speeds. Radars: A wave radar and camera placed on the windscreen reads traffic signs and the road’s curvature and can detect objects on the road such as other road users. Four radars behind the front and rear bumpers also locate objects. Two long-range radars on the bumper are used to detect fast-moving vehicles approaching from far behind, which is useful on motorways. Cameras: Four cameras - two on the wing mirrors, one on the grille and one on the rear bumper - monitor objects in close proximity to the vehicle and lane markings. A trifocal camera on the windscreen provides a broad 140° view, a 45° view and a long-range, yet narrow, 34° view for improved depth perception and distant-object detection. It’s used to spot suddenly appearing pedestrians and unexpected road hazards. 3D digital map: An HD 3D digital map is used to provide the vehicle with information about the surroundings, such as road curvature, number of lanes, geometry of tunnels and signs etc. ‘High performance GPS’ is matched with the map and the 360° image created by the multitude of sensors, to give the car information about its position in relation to the surroundings. This means the Drive Me car is able to choose the best course in real time, factoring in variables such as the curvature of the road, speed limit, temporary signs and other traffic. Volvo's Drive Me cars rely on 28 cameras, sensors and lasers as well as software rules to drive itself on busy roads. Like other autonomous systems, the system needs a user to select a chosen route so it can use a cloud-based digital map to guide the car's driving, giving it an awareness of known obstacles and features on the road. The cars use a complex network of sensors, cloud-based positioning systems and intelligent braking and steering technologies. Dr Mertens said: ‘Autonomous driving will fundamentally change the way we look at driving. In the future, you will be able to choose between autonomous and active driving. ‘This transforms everyday commuting from lost time to quality time, opening up new opportunities for work and pleasure.’ It is not clear how much the people involved in the trial will have to take control of their vehicles, but it seems unlikely they will be able to chat on a phone, watch a film or do some work, for example, as the car motors along. This is the aspiration for the future. Volvo’s autopilot system is designed to allow the car to take over every aspect of driving in autonomous mode, which the company says is a ‘crucial’ step beyond the automotive systems demonstrated, because it includes fault-tolerant systems. Dr Erik Coelingh, technical specialist at Volvo Cars, said: ‘It is relatively easy to build and demonstrate a self-driving concept vehicle, but if you want to create an impact in the real world, you have to design and produce a complete system that will be safe, robust and affordable for ordinary customers.’ The main challenge for engineers is building a system that’s robust enough to cope with technical faults that might occur, because a ‘driver’ might not be on the ball enough to respond to a situation immediately, if their attention is focused elsewhere. Initially, the cars will drive autonomously on selected roads with suitable conditions, for example without oncoming traffic, cyclists and pedestrians. Mr Coelingh said: ‘Making this complex system 99 per cent reliable is not good enough. You need to get much closer to 100 per cent before you can let self-driving cars mix with other road users in real-life traffic. The car relies on 28 cameras, sensors and lasers as well as software rules to drive itself on busy roads. Initially, the cars (illustrated) will drive autonomously on selected roads with suitable conditions, for example without oncoming traffic, cyclists and pedestrians . ‘Here, we have a similar approach to that of the aircraft industry. Our fail-operational architecture includes backup systems that will ensure that Autopilot will continue to function safely also if an element of the system were to become disabled.’ Volvo says that its autopilot systems can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios’ such as heavy traffic and emergency situations which require quick, hard braking. Mr Coelingh said: ‘Just as good drivers would, potentially critical situations are approached with sensible caution. In a real emergency, however, the car reacts faster than most humans.’ The system, however, isn’t designed to negotiate exceptional weather conditions or if the end of a route is reached. In such cases, the driver will be prompted to take over. If the driver doesn't take over in time, the car will bring itself to a safe place to stop.","Trial is slated to begin on selected roads in Gothenburg, Sweden .

But three Indonesian men convicted of trying to import 389kg of heroin into Australia, who were caught by Australian not Indonesian authorities, are preparing to be released and will be allowed to return home to Indonesia, Fairfax reported. In October 1998, Krist Tito Mandagi, Saud Siregar and Sidiki Ismunandar were intercepted near Port Macquarie on the NSW mid north coast on a vessel carrying more than $600 million worth of heroin in black sports bags.

Their vessel was intercepted at Grants Beach in North Haven after leaving from the Andaman Sea near the Thai-Burma border in August 1998. When weighed it was found the heroin powder on board contained 252kg of pure heroin. In the NSW District Court, the boat's captain Mandagi received a life sentence with a non-parole period of 25 years.

"Wesleyan University says at least 11 students have been hospitalized with symptoms of overdoses on the drug known as 'Molly.' Dean Michael Whaley, vice president of student affairs, said in a letter to the campus that one of the students, a sophomore, was in critical condition at Middlesex Hospital on Sunday. The university says it's aware of 11 students being treated for overdose symptoms consistent with the use of Molly, a stimulant psychoactive drug also known as methylone, MDMA or a handful of other substances akin to ecstasy. Scroll down for video . Overdoses: Wesleyan University says at least 11 students have been hospitalized with symptoms of overdoses on the drug known as 'Molly' According to FoxCT, seven of the students were sent to the hospital via ambulance and four went to hospitals on their own. No other information about their conditions was released. Whaley said Middletown police, university police and residence officials are investigating. The school's administration asked students on Sunday to check on their friends and make sure they aren't in danger. 'I ask that you keep these students in your thoughts and share my hope that they will fully recover,' Whaley said. Middletown and university police declined immediate comment. Molly is the street name for drugs  pushed as a pure form of ecstasy. Molly is the street name for drugs pushed as a pure form of ecstasy . In the last five years, Molly has made its way into popular culture, helped by references to it made by entertainers such as Madonna, Miley Cyrus and Kanye West. The drug's dangers became more clear after a rash of overdoses in recent years. The parties of the late 1980s and early '90s saw the heyday of ecstasy, but its popularity began to wane a decade ago after a number of deaths and hospitalizations. That's when Molly made her way onto the scene. Over the last few years, drugs sold under that name have 'flooded' the market, said Rusty Payne, a spokesman with the Drug Enforcement Administration. In some states, there has been a 100-fold increase - the combined number of arrests, seizures, emergency room mentions and overdoses - between 2009 and 2012, according to DEA figures. The drug is accessible and marketed to recreational drug users who believe it to be less dangerous than its predecessor, which was often cut with other substances, from Ritalin to LSD. Like ecstasy, Molly is said to give a lengthy, euphoric high with slight hallucinogenic properties. In reality, however, the promised pure MDMA experience 'doesn't exist,' said Payne.","Dean of students at the Middletown, Connecticut university said one of the students was in critical condition Sunday .

"Turkey has blasted Britain for being too slow to inform it about three London schoolgirls who travelled to Turkey last week possibly en route to join Islamist militants in Syria. Yesterday, David Cameron announced all teenagers boarding flights to Turkey could be challenged by airlines about whether they plan to join ISIS under new plans. The Prime Minister told MPs that talks were being held with airlines to alert the police to ensure that 'at risk children are properly identified and questioned'. Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs that talks were being held with airlines to alert the police to ensure that 'at risk children are properly identified and questioned' It came after three London schoolgirls who are feared to have fled Britain to join ISIS, boarding a flight to Turkey before slipping into neighbouring Syria. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said he hoped the girls would be found, but that it would be Britain, not Turkey, to blame if they were not. 'It is an condemnable act for Britain to let three girls ... come to Istanbul and then let us know three days later . 'They haven't taken the necessary measures,' he said. The three London schoolgirls arrived at Istanbul airport on February 17 and British authorities, concerned that they were travelling to join Islamic State fighters, informed Ankara on February 20, Arinc said. Turkey was able to do little to track the movements of three people who had entered as tourists, he said. Lured to jihad: Kadiza Sultana, 16, left, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and Amira Abase, 15, right, at Gatwick . 'The search is ongoing. It would be great if we can find them. But if we can't, it is not us who will be responsible, but the British.' Thousands of foreigners from more than 80 countries have joined the ranks of Islamic State and other radical groups in Syria and Iraq, many crossing through Turkey. Turkey has said it needs more detailed and faster information from Western intelligence agencies to intercept them. Yesterday, it emerged that police spoke to Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15, just months before they disappeared and found 'no evidence' that they had been radicalised . Officers were deployed to the school as part of counter-terrorism and anti-radicalisation measures after another teenage girl from Bethnal Green Academy in east London fled to join ISIS. Mr Cameron said that measures are in place to stop people with known terror links from travelling, but the latest case of the three girls highlighted problems with unaccompanied teenagers who are not on watch lists. In a Commons statement, Mr Cameron stressed that stopping travel to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 'vital'. He told MPs: 'When people are known risks, whatever their age, they go on our Border Warnings Index and we can intervene to prevent travel and seize their passports. 'But what this incident has highlighted is the concerning situation where unaccompanied teenagers like these - who are not a known risk - can board a flight to Turkey without necessarily being asked questions by the airline. 'We need new proportionate arrangements with airlines to ensure that these at risk children are properly identified and questioned. Flight to terror: Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to Istanbul . 'Whenever there are concerns, police at the border should be alerted so they can use the new temporary passport seizure powers to stop people travelling.' He revealed Home Secretary Theresa May and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will be working with the airlines to bring this about. It follows concern about differences between airlines on the rules governing children travelling alone on flights. The latest schoolgirls to go missing are feared to have fled to Syria to become Jihadi brides after being ruthlessly groomed online and 'brainwashed in their bedrooms'. They walked out of their homes last Tuesday before strolling through security checks at Gatwick Airport and flying to Turkey. Police fear their goal is to reach the terror stronghold of Raqqa where they face being married off to foreign fighters. 'Groomed': Shamima Begum (right) is thought to have been contacted directly using Twitter by a female IS fighter. She later flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey with friends Kadiza Sultana, left, 16, and Amira Abase . Mr Cameron said: 'All of us have been horrified by the way that British teenagers appear to have been radicalised and duped by this poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism while at home on the internet in their bedrooms. 'They appear to have been induced to join a terrorist group that carries out the most hideous violence and believes girls should be married at nine and women should not leave the home.' Bethnal Green Academy headteacher Mark Keary (pictured) said there was no evidence that the girls had been radicalised at the school . Police spoke to the three British 'jihadi brides' just months before they disappeared and found 'no evidence' that they had been radicalised, it emerged today. Mark Keary, the headteacher of Bethnal Green Academy in east London - which Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15, all attended - revealed that police had spoken to the girls last year. Despite fears that the girls were groomed online, Mr Keary issued a statement today in which he insisted the trio were not radicalised at school. He said access to Twitter and Facebook through school computers was 'strictly regulated'. Mr Keary said: 'With such measures in place, police have advised us that there is no evidence that radicalisation of the students took place at the academy. 'From the increasing number of similar news reports around the world, it's clear that this is an international issue that is increasing in severity and it is affecting schools across the country and beyond. 'We are constantly reviewing our safeguarding procedures.' Shamima, who is thought to be travelling on her sister's passport, was 'following' more than 70 known extremists on Twitter – many of them thought to be ISIS fighters. At least one of the girls is also thought to have been contacted directly using Twitter by a female ISIS fighter. However, despite these accounts being well known, none have been suspended by Twitter bosses. Mr Cameron said it highlighted the need for social media companies to do more to help the police and security agencies. He called for greater co-operation over contacts between extremists and those who could be radicalised. 'Internet companies have a social responsibility. And we expect them to live up to it,' the PM said. The UK government is also stepping up pressure for an EU-wide deal on sharing flight passenger records to track potential jihadists. It would provide the names of passengers, and details of how tickets were bought and the bank accounts used and who people are travelling with. Mr Cameron said it would offer 'vital information to help us identify in advance when people are travelling on high risk routes'. He raised the issue with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in December. However, the European Passenger Name Records directive has stalled in Brussels after a row about human rights. In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, a meeting of the European Council last week agreed that MEPs should urgently adopt a 'strong and effective' European Passenger Name Records directive. Mr Cameron stressed that tackling the problem was not just an issue for our police and border controls. 'We do need schools and universities and colleges to put aside concerns about cultural sensitivity or suchlike and really make sure they are doing everything they can to tackle people at risk of radicalisation. 'It is quite similar in some ways to the problem of forced marriage where we have had people disappearing from schools in parts of the country without there being proper ... protection in those schools. 'Indeed it is quite similar to the problem of FGM, but it is on an enormous scale and that is why we need to take such action.'","Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister said he hoped the girls would be found .

"You get excited over the discovery of a vintage coat or pretty vase in a charity shop. But one treasure hunter has come across an ancient Egyptian seal that could be more than 3,000 years old, among people’s discarded junk. Archaeologist James Balme, who paid just £12 ($19) for the seal on a charity website, believes it bears the cartouche of Ramesses the Great, who ruled Egypt between 1,279 and 1,213BC. Scroll down for video . One treasure hunter has come across an ancient Egyptian seal that appears to be more than 3,000 years old, among people’s discarded junk in a charity shop. This image shows the seal, left and the impression it makes, right, meaning the hieroglyphs read as they should . In Egyptian hieroglyphs, a cartouche is an oval with a horizontal line at one end, indicating that the text enclosed is a royal name. He came across the ancient artefact while trawling the website of a charity shop in Hertfordshire. The carved stone has hieroglyphs carved into one side that can be used as a seal, and a scene on its reverse, showing a man sitting down with an eagle over his head and a scarab beetle at his feet. Mr Balme, who also works as a television presenter, believes that it is the scene that makes the object so unusual – and he has sought the opinion of experts to work out just how rare his £12 ($19) find is. The seal still has traces of red ochre as well as grains of sand embedded deep inside the carved lines of the object. ‘As the cartouche is the royal seal of Ramesses II then it is plausible that the figure seated could be that of Ramesses himself (illustrated in a cast relief depicting the pharaoh hunting). This is a real mystery at the moment but an exciting one nonetheless,’ Mr Balme said . The carved stone piece has hieroglyphs carved into one side, which could be used as a seal and a scene on its reverse, showing a man sitting down and an eagle over his head and a scarab beetle at his feet. Further analysis is needed to try and work out whether the man is Ramesses II . Ramesses II, was king of Egypt from 1279 to 1213 BC and is also known as Ramesses ‘the great’. He ascended the throne as the third king of the Nineteenth Dynasty at the age of twenty-five. It’s thought that during his 67 year reign, he built more temples and fathered more children than any other pharaoh. He founded a new capital, Piramesse and built temples throughout Egypt and Nubia. The most famous of these buildings is the Abu Simbel, cut into rock, and ‘the Ramesseum’ – his mortuary temple at Thebes. The tomb of his principal wife, Nefertari, is one of the best preserved royal tombs and the resting place of some of his sons has recently been uncovered in the Valley of the Kings. ‘The hieroglyphics on the flat face of the stone should be able to be translated in the coming weeks telling us more about the history of the stone,’ he told MailOnline. ‘As [it seems that] the cartouche is the royal seal of Ramesses II then it is plausible that the figure seated could be that of Ramesses himself. 'This is a real mystery at the moment but an exciting one nonetheless.’ Sometimes amulets were given in the form of a cartouche displaying the name of a king and placed in tombs, as a symbol of good luck. Such items are often important to archaeologists for dating the tomb and its contents. They were also regularly worn by pharaohs and the oval surrounding their name was meant to protect them from evil spirits in life and in death. Egyptians believed that individuals who had their name recorded, would not disappear after death. Mr Balme said: ‘The stone is in the form of an Egyptian funerary stele - a kind of tombstone. ‘The front of the stone depicts a pharaoh seated below the wings of Horus [whose] wings [are] offering protection as the pharaoh passes into the afterlife. Mr Balme, a television presenter who is pictured left next to Tony Robinson, believes that it is the scene that makes the object so unusual – and he has sought the opinion of experts to work out just how rare his £12 find is, as well as what the inscription says . Ramesses II founded a new capital, Piramesse, and built temples throughout Egypt and Nubia. The most famous of these buildings is the Abu Simbel, cut into rock (pictured) and ‘the Ramesseum’ – his mortuary temple at Thebes . ‘Alongside him is carved a cartouche of a scarab beetle and the transformation into the sun - a symbol of rebirth in the afterlife. ‘Could the seated pharaoh be that of Ramesses II?’ he asked. Based on the condition of the stone, Mr Balme thinks it shows signs of being buried in sand. He has also found traces of red ochre, which was used by the ancient Egyptians as a form of paint. ‘The seal also has some slight traces of wax in the carved faces indicating that it may have been used to add a seal to documents,’ he said, adding that more analysis of the object is needed. Mr Balme spotted the seal on a charity website, noting that it had not had much interest from other prospective buyers. Before purchasing it, he looked into its age and importance. ‘I researched the hieroglyphics as a starting point and found that they are the royal cartouche of King Ramesses II,' he said. While the seal was on display in the shop, it came to his attention on the charity's website, which sells ‘almost anything from clothes to jewellery’. Earlier this month, Mr Balme purchased a 'garden ornament' in Leicester which has an intricate pattern likely carved in Anglo Saxon times. He said the pattern ‘may be some form of writing,’ although there are so far no suggestions about what the 'text' or shapes may mean. Mr Balme found the stone while he was looking for interesting stone carvings to buy on an auction website. 'As I immediately recognised just how important it could prove to be I just had to purchase it to save it from ending up in another garden or even thrown away at worst,' he said. It weighs around 60lbs (27kg) and is wider at the base than at the top. Earlier this month, Mr Balme purchased a 'garden ornament' in Leicester (pictured) which has an intricate pattern likely carved in Anglo Saxon times . The relief work does not resemble any known text, however, but the shape and style of the rock is typical of Anglo-Saxon monumental art. He told MailOnline: 'Regarding the carvings on the stone my initial feeling is that these are symbols rather than straightforward text.' Mr Balme suggested that the stone could be ‘a keystone from an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling.’ He also tweeted that the stone could be the base of a cross or a tombstone. Mr Balme believes the stone dates to the Anglo-Saxon period, which stretched between 410 and 1066AD. The period is known for its intricate patterns, which appeared on buildings and jewellery, for example, as well as written literature such as the poem Beowulf. However, the date is only a guess and he has asked his Twitter followers for help in learning more about the mysterious stone.","Double-sided carved seal was found in a charity shop in Hertfordshire .

"The juggernaut computer system that pays out more than $100 billion a year in welfare to people across Australia is on the brink of collapse according to Tony Abbott's Human Services Minister. Centrelink's archaic Income Security Integrated System (ISIS), which was set up in 1983, is reportedly unable to cope with demand and the government is finding it increasingly difficult to hire people who know how to use the outdated software. Human Services Minister Marise Payne told Daily Mail Australia: 'Very few organisations around the world still use this type of computer system and that makes finding and attracting skilled staff difficult.' 'To deal with the increased demands over the years the original system has literally had another 350 systems bolted on. To put it simply, we are running a turbo-charged Commodore 64 with a spoiler in the age of the iPhone,' Ms Payne explained. When it was first launched the database management system only handled $10 billion worth of payments to around 2.5 million people. It is now buckling under the pressure of serving out cash to 7.3 million citizens. Human Services minister Marise Payne, seen here in 2013, has described the department's IT system as a 'Commodore 64' 'The government is currently considering whether to replace the current welfare payments IT system,' Ms Payne said. 'Despite its age and extraordinary complexity, the Department's payment system is very reliable and has an extremely high level of payment accuracy.' The minister said one of the issues with the current system is that it creates additional work for staff and customers. 'For example, the current system is built around individual payments and not the person, or their family. This means every time a customer starts a new claim they are treated as a new customer and have to provide some or all of their details again, which causes understandable frustration,' Ms Payne explained. 'The department has a highly skilled and committed team of ICT experts working in this area, some of who have worked on the system for more than two decades. The government now faces a significant challenge to retain this level of knowledge into the future let alone attract new IT staff.' The Model 204 database management system, designed by the Computer Corporation of America, is also used by the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. The Centrelink IT database was built in 1983 and is in urgent need of an overhaul according to Treasurer Joe Hockey (right) Ms Payne is not the first government member to call for an overhaul of the 30-year-old system. In April 2014, Treasurer Joe Hockey told radio show 3AW that upgrading the IT infrastructure was essential. 'We have to do it. The question is how we will do it and how we will ensure that we improve service delivery into the future,' Mr Hockey said. He described the system as 'ageing' and 'in bad shape' and said it is 'inhibiting the capacity of the government, to some degree, to roll out policy that properly addresses problems in the economy and in the budget'. Marise Payne, seen here in the Centrelink Cabramatta Service Centre, believes the IT system needs an upgrade . And in 2013, Human Services Chief Information Officer Gary Sterrenberg described the ISIS system as 'a soldier'. He told the website IT News: 'The ISIS system has been a trusted servant of our social welfare program… a lot of people call it legacy… I prefer to call it heritage.' Talking about his dreams of an upgrade he said: 'I will be looking at whatever solution can service the business needs that we have.' Mr Sterrenberg has Human Services Minister Marise Payne on board after he was granted a $16.2 million budget to put forward a business case for a replacement or upgrade of the major Centrelink IT system. The cost was met from within the existing resources of the department. The government is finding it increasingly difficult to hire people who know how to use the Centrelink IT software . A statement from the department in 2013 said: 'An upgraded system will have increased capacity to support the current and changing needs of Australians and enable the department to continue to support and deliver Government programs efficiently and effectively. 'This will enable us to build on the work we are already doing to give customers a greater degree of convenience, simplicity and security through improved access to online and self-service options. No customer payments will be affected by this measure and customers do not have to do anything to benefit.'","Centrelink's IT system was designed in 1983 by an American company .

"Hundreds of Air France passengers were left frustrated and angry after their transatlantic flight diverted to Manchester Airport and they sat through a series of delays lasting up to 20 hours. The Airbus A380 was flying from New York to Paris when it was forced to land because its flight crew was in danger of exceeding its maximum allowable hours if the plane continued to France, said the airline, which is now offering compensation. The 440 passengers were left on the plane for more than six hours and an ambulance was required for one person - the reason for which is yet to be confirmed. Some British travellers say they were initially told they would have to continue on to Paris before getting another flight back to the UK. Scroll down for video . Stuck: The 220 passengers were forced to stay seated on the plane for almost seven hours, according to some British travellers . Air France passenger Mael Tannou tweeted this photo, saying his delay lasted more than 12 hours . Yesterday's wintry weather at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport led to a delayed departure and that pushed the plane's two pilots to the legal limit for flight times. Air France said: 'In order to comply with current European legislation on maximum working times for flight crew, the crew had to land at Manchester.' The plane's 440 passengers and 22 crew members were already more than six hours behind schedule when the plane departed New York at about 1:10am local time yesterday. Flight AF007 landed in Manchester shortly after 11am local time and passengers were not allowed to exit the plane for the terminal building until around 6.30pm. The Airbus A380 was forced to land at Manchester Airport because its crew had reached its flight time quota . Air France sent three additional Airbus aircraft – two A320s and an A318 – to pick up the passengers . One woman who lives just a couple of miles from Manchester Airport said she was eventually allowed to go home at 7pm - without her luggage. She had been due to get a connecting flight back to Manchester from Paris. The woman told the M.E.N: 'They wouldn't let us off the plane - I kept saying ""I only live down the road, please can you let me off?"" 'But there were other people on there flying to all over Europe from Paris. 'There was no food whatsoever. There were kids who hadn't eaten since leaving New York the previous day who had had no food. 'There was a lot of frustration on the flight, people were getting quite annoyed. 'Eventually, about 6pm they let us off into a secluded area near departures and 50 Burger King burgers were sent down. 'About 13 of us who live in the UK refused to get on the later flight to Paris so eventually they let us go, but our bags had to go on the original plane and I am still waiting to get my luggage back.' Medical emergency: An ambulance was seen arriving at the plane as passengers were finally allowed to leave for the terminal . Passengers complained about a lack of information and compensation while they were in Manchester . Exhausted passengers who weren't from the UK were forced to wait inside the terminal for more than 12 hours before they boarded one of three rescue flights. They were unable to fly to France on the A380 that landed in Manchester because it experienced a cabin pressure problem and was unable to take-off, the airline said. Air France sent three additional Airbus aircraft – two A320s and an A318 – to pick up the passengers and fly them to Paris. Many vented their frustration on Twitter, calling it ‘an awful experience’ and ‘the worst flight experience of my life’. Passenger Mael Tannou tweeted a photo that showed dozens of passengers waiting at the gate during a delay that lasted more than 12 hours. Passenger Didier Bodel complained about a lack of information from Air France and told French news network BFMTV that passengers became angry as they waited at Manchester Airport. Reaction: Many passengers vented their frustration on Twitter, calling it ‘an awful experience’ and ‘the worst flight experience of my life’ A Twitter user snapped this photo as the Air France plane made its final approach to Manchester Airport . He said the passenger list included three unaccompanied minors, who were without supervision and became upset. 'These children are crying. People are crazy mad,' he told BFMTV. Another passenger, Joe Ze, tweeted: 'Passengers waiting w/dignity despite 18hrs stuck btw JFK&CDG no food no rest. How will @airfrance compensate?' French politician Bruno Le Maire was also on board after visiting New York, where he was photographed meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. It is understood delays were made worse when a passenger fell ill, the Manchester Evening News reported. An Air France spokesperson told BFMTV that the decision to divert to Manchester was the best solution, despite the inconvenience for passengers. The airline said in a statement: 'Air France fully understands that its customers are frustrated at this situation. Some passengers were stranded in Manchester for more than 12 hours before a rescue flight arrived . 'Throughout these incidents, Air France has done everything it could to limit the inconvenience while ensuring that passengers and crew remain safe. 'Air France will very soon be contacting passengers to offer them compensation. This will be addressed as a matter of priority.' An airline spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel that the compensation amount has not been determined. The French carrier's Airbus A380 fleet is configured to seat a maximum of 516 passengers in first, business and economy classes.","Plane was forced to land at Manchester Airport after a delay in New York .

"A Texas woman accused of keeping her severely malnourished five-year-old stepson in a closet under the stairs until he weighed only 29lbs has been charged with felony injury to a child by omission. Tammi Bleimeyer, 34, from outside Houston, was charged with felony child endangerment last year when the disturbing treatment of the boy, Jordan, came to light after his stepbrother spoke out. Jordan was visibly emaciated in March 2014, with bones visible through his skin and bruises, according to authorities. He went to pediatric intensive care before regaining health. Warning: disturbing images below . Tammi Bleimeyer, 34, now faces felony injury to a child charges for the malnourishment of her stepson . Tammi Bleimeyer, (right) 34, now faces felony injury to a child charges for the malnourishment of her stepson Jordan (left) Bones were visible through Jordan's bruised skin when he was taken by protective services last spring . Now six, he began kindergarten last year. A soiled mattress was found in a closet under the Bleimeyer's home along with a lock. Mrs Bleimeyer denied the abuse and said that her 16-year-old biological son was lying because he did not respect his new  24-year-old stepdad, Jordan's biological father, because of the small age difference. The biological mother of seven is now estranged from husband Bradley Bleimeyer, who was also charged with child endangerment. Jordan's biological mother Wendy Hall said the boy told her he was fed just a cup of water and a piece of bread every day. He was also allegedly drugged by his father to keep him quiet when guests were over. Mrs Bleimeyer posted $30,000 bail on Saturday while her estranged husband Bradley remains in jail on $150,000 bond. He was not charged with the additional felony injury to a child by omission . Child protective services took custody of Jordan and Mrs Bleimeyer's other children. Ms Hall was granted access to her son while he stayed with an aunt. Mrs Bleimeyer's six-week-old baby, which did not show signs of abuse, was taken from her in October after an Amber Alert for the newborn was issued. The baby was given to foster care. The mother turned herself in to the latest charges Saturday and was released on $30,000 bond, according to KHOU. Mr Bleimeyer remains in prison with bail set at $150,000 and no new charges have been filed against him. Their next court appearance is set for March 2, according to the Houston Chronicle. Thousands of dollars were donated to the care of Jordan after an appeal on the Dr Phil show. First degree felonies are punishable by up to life in prison.

"'Not the answer': Locking up more criminals is a ‘sign of failure’ Nick Clegg, pictured, will say . Locking up more criminals is a ‘sign of failure’ Nick Clegg will say today. The Lib Dem leader will use a speech to insist that prison is ‘not the answer’ for many offenders and will outline reforms to cut the number of women, people with mental health problems and drug users behind bars. He will call for greater use of tagging and community service, adding: ‘Simply locking up more and more people is not a sign of success, it’s a sign of failure.’ Mr Clegg will say ‘dangerous, serial criminals’ should go to jail, but that for ‘vulnerable women, addicts and people with mental health problems, prison isn’t working’. He will add: ‘There are more than 85,000 people in prison in England and Wales today. In 1994, there were fewer than 49,000. ‘I don’t believe there are 36,000 more dangerous people now than then. We have not become a more vicious or sinister society.’ He will say: ‘Simply locking up more and more people is not a sign of success it’s a sign of failure.’ The speech will be seen as a strong indication that the Lib Dems will seek to slash the prison population if they end up in a new coalition government after the election. Last year, Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes said he wanted to abolish jail sentences of less than a year. Mr Clegg will also say the Youth Justice Board – which handles offenders aged up to 18 – should be extended so it deals with all offenders up to the age of 21. But this will raise fears that more young adult offenders will be let out on the streets or given reprimands or other ‘soft’ punishments instead of being locked up. Last night, a Tory source said one of the reasons for the rise in the prison population recently is the growing number of convicted sex offenders. The source said: ‘Surely the Lib Dems wouldn’t say they should be anywhere else but behind bars?’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘Under this Government, crime is down and our communities are safer. If we have to send more people to prison to achieve that, so be it. ‘Prison works – I’m clear about that. But we also have a duty to make sure it works better at rehabilitating offenders so that don’t keep coming back time and again.’ Mr Clegg will say fewer women, people with mental health problems and drug users should be jailed, and complain that they are being ‘crammed like sardines into crowded prisons’ (file image) Mr Clegg will say fewer women, people with mental health problems and drug users should be jailed, and complain that they are being ‘crammed like sardines into crowded prisons’. He will say: ‘Dangerous, serial criminals’ should go to jail, but that for ‘vulnerable women, addicts and people with mental health problems prison isn’t working. ‘We want to end the revolving door that sees offenders leave prison with no help and no hope, only to return to their cell a few weeks later. ‘And if your only crime is possession of drugs for personal use, we want to see you in treatment or education, not a prison cell’. Mr Clegg will insist that his proposed reforms will ‘make us safer’. Last year, Mr Hughes said there should be a legal presumption that no-one should go to jail for less than 12 months, and instead criminals should be given community or suspended sentences. That would mean 60,000 fewer criminals going to prison every year – including thousands of violent thugs, burglars, sex attackers and robbers. Over time, it would lead to the halving of the current prison population of nearly 85,000, leaving tens of thousands of repeat criminals on the streets instead of behind bars.","Liberal Democrat leader to criticise the growth in the prison population .

Sophie Gorton escaped prison after she ploughed into the path of a father-of-two in her car and killed him, and told a judge of her 'extreme remorse' - despite posting Facebook updates about her 'great year' and holidays she had enjoyed in the weeks and months after the death of Allan Wellings, 40 . She told the court she was very sorry for what had happened to the school minibus driver and the judge said it was unlikely anyone could punish her as much as she would punish herself . Gorton, of Moston in Manchester, also posted snaps from a New Year's Eve party, moving into her 'nice, cosy' new home with her boyfriend and being 'super happy'. A note she posted on Christmas Day said: 'I've had a great year- thanks for being part of it'. At a hearing at Oldham Magistrates' Court the student nurse admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was given a 12 month ban as well as 80 hours of unpaid work. She told the court she was very sorry for what had happened to the school minibus driver and the judge said it was unlikely anyone could punish her as much as she would punish herself. But after the hearing Mr Wellings' family branded the justice system 'pathetic' as they revealed Gorton had posted a number of happy updates on Facebook shortly after the crash. Miss Gorton posted about her great Christmas and new year, celebrating moving in with her boyfriend . Mr Wellings' widow Chelsea Gibson, 29, from Heywood, said: 'We haven't heard any remorse. She has never apologised to us face to face. How can she say she is remorseful when you look at her Facebook and she's going on about all the fantastic times she has had and 'brilliant' trips to Helsinki and New York. 'How does she think that makes me feel? We have been in bits since Allan's death and yet the magistrates are accepting that she has been remorseful when it appears she's been having a great time since he died.' Mr Wellings, who drove a minibus for children and the disabled, was taking his motorbike out last July and was approaching a set of green traffic lights at about 7pm when the accident took place. Allan Wellings died in July last year after he tried to throw himself off his motorbike to avoid the car . Gorton, who was travelling in the opposite direction in a Fiat 500 suddenly turned right into his path. Mr Wellings tried to throw himself clear of  his Honda Fireblade motorbike in an attempt to avoid the impact but suffered fatal injuries. He was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital where he later died. In the weeks following his death Gorton posted a number of happy pictures of herself. One photo showed a bottle of champagne at Manchester Airport with the message: 'Starting our adventure in style.' Mr Wellings, a father to Ryan, 18, and Alfie, 10, has been described as a man with a 'heart of gold'. Ms Gibson said: 'He loved his work and loved the children and the children loved him back. Allan was my best friend and the perfect dad to his two sons. It has affected us all in ways I can't describe. 'Now Allan is not here his sons miss him so much and are losing out on the fun and experiences only a father can bring. I have returned to work and am trying to keep the family together. Alfie is having bereavement counselling and I am getting help at work. I have vivid dreams about him which wake me up and I can't get back to sleep. We talk about him a lot and remember the fun times we had together.' Ms Gibson said children at the school who used to use the minibus he drove wrote a letter saying how much they missed him and felt he was part of the family. Gorton appeared at Oldham Magistrates' Court where she was sentenced to unpaid work and banned from driving. Mr Wellings' family told the court he only rode his motorbike in summer because he thought it was too dangerous in the winter months. Gorton has posted a number of smiling snaps and happy updates in the months since the car accident . Fun in Helsinki: Gorton posted these snaps on December 22 - just one of the happy updates that have upset the family of Allan Wellings . The student nurse told the court of her 'extreme remorse' but has celebrated holidays in posts on Facebook . Peter Malone, defending Gorton, said she had passed her driving test when she was 19 had almost completed a nursing degree at Edge Hill University and is due to start work at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in August. He added: 'She is someone who has written a letter saying she is remorseful, sorry and regrets the tragic event that took place. If she could turn back the clock she would. She has been feeling and is still feeling extremely sorry for the family and she can only imagine what they are feeling at such a sad time. 'She wishes the family to know both herself and her family are feeling for them and she has lost sleep over the accident with the worry it has brought and she can only imagine what the gentleman's family are going through themselves.' Chelsea Gibson said Gorton has never apologised to them for killing her partner and father of two . Mr Malone said the 21-year-old was still struggling to come to terms with what had happened. The Facebook postings were not mentioned in court. Justice of the Peace Alan Moss said: 'Nobody can punish Sophie Gorton probably more than she has and will punish herself continually for this. There are tragic consequences as a result of this offence, but we as magistrates have guidelines in sentencing. We view this offence as a momentary lapse, a lone case of inattention.' After the hearing Mr Wellings older brother Brian, 48, said: 'She will be living her life as normal and will even be driving around again in 12 months time whilst Allan's poor kids have to grow up without a father. Their lives will never be the same again. 'Allan is gone and there is nothing we can do to change that. We would like to think there is remorse from this lady but I'm not sure she feels genuine remorse.'","Sophie Gorton admitted causing death by dangerous driving in Oldham .

"We've long been told that the main risk factor for type 2 diabetes is obesity. Now, however, scientists have discovered a lack of sunshine increases the risk of diabetes more than weight. A new study has warned people who have low levels of vitamin D are more likely to be obese and more likely to have type 2 diabetes. They are also more likely than people with normal vitamin D levels to have pre-diabetes - a condition which means a person's blood sugar is elevated. If left untreated, they are likely to develop type 2 diabetes within a decade. A lack of the 'sunshine' vitamin D - rather than being obese -  raises the risk of diabetes, researchers say. The vitamin plays a role in how the body metabolises sugar . Their risk of metabolic syndrome - a medical term for a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity - is also increased. Metabolic syndrome puts a person at greater risk of heart disease, stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels. The new Spanish study found it was a deficiency in vitamin D - dubbed the 'sunshine vitamin' - rather than what a person weighs that increased their risk of diabetes. This is because there was a direct link between low vitamin D levels and how the body metabolised glucose. Obese people who did not have diabetes or another blood sugar disorder had higher levels of vitamin D than the participants with diabetes. Likewise, lean participants with diabetes or another pre-diabetes disorder were more likely to have low levels of the nutrient. Vitamin D helps control calcium that keeps bones and muscles healthy and regulates the immune system, which could help prevent diseases such as eczema and asthma. Vitamin D is formed under the skin in a reaction to sunlight, but small amounts are also found in foods like eggs and oily fish. One billion people worldwide are estimated to be deficient in the nutrient . Most of the nutrient is formed under the skin in a reaction to sunlight, but small amounts are also found in foods like vitamin-D-fortified milk, oily fish and eggs. Yet one billion people worldwide are estimated to have deficient levels of vitamin D due to a lack of exposure to sunshine. Dr Manuel Macías-González, of the University of Malaga, Spain, said: 'Our findings indicate that vitamin D is associated more closely with glucose metabolism than obesity. The number of children with vitamin D deficiency has soared by more than 200 per cent in five years because parents are unaware how important it is for health, a study revealed. It also exposed a ‘worrying’ lack of knowledge by GPs and health workers about the Government’s guidelines on the vitamin. Public health officials are advising parents to give their children supplements and fortified foods. This is to avoid a return to ‘Victorian’ levels of vitamin D deficiency, when the bone-softening disease rickets was common, they said. Foods such as oily fish, eggs and mushrooms naturally contain vitamin D, but many cereals and some dairy products are fortified with the vitamin. Skin exposure to sunlight from March to October also produces vitamin D. 'The study suggests that vitamin D deficiency and obesity interact synergistically to heighten the risk of diabetes and other metabolic disorders. 'The average person may be able to reduce their risk by maintaining a healthy diet and getting enough outdoor activity.' The study, published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, clarifies the connection between vitamin D, obesity and diabetes. Mercedes Clemente-Postigo, of the same university, added: 'The major strength of this study is that it compares vitamin D levels in people at a wide range of weights, from lean to morbidly obese subjects, while taking whether they had diabetes into account.' It compared vitamin D biomarkers in 148 participants who had their BMI measured and tested for diabetes, pre-diabetes or no blood sugar disorders. Researchers measured levels of vitamin D in the participants' bloodstreams and levels in fat tissue. Obese people who did not have glucose metabolism disorders had higher levels of vitamin D than those who were diabetic. Lean people with diabetes or another glucose metabolism disorder were more likely to have low levels of vitamin D. Therefore, vitamin D levels were directly correlated with glucose levels, but not with BMI, the researchers concluded.","Study: Vitamin D levels are more closely linked with diabetes than obesity .
People with low levels of vitamin D more likely to have type 2 diabetes .
Also more likely to have pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome .
Vitamin D is 'more closely linked with glucose metabolism than obesity'"
"Victoria Beckham has never been short on 'girl power' and now the pop star-turned-fashion designer has been heralded as one of the most inspirational woman of her generation. The mother-of-four topped an illustrious list of women who 'inspire, empower and game-change' within the fashion industry. She saw off style royalty including Kate Moss, Stella McCartney and Mary Portas, in the survey by Grazia magazine, to be voted most inspirational woman in fashion. Victoria Beckham was voted most inspirational women in fashion in the last ten years in a new poll . Harry Potter star Emma Watson fought of competition from Kim Kardashian to be voted most influential woman in entertainment in the Grazia survey which marks the magazine's 10th anniversary . In 2006 the former Spice Girl launched her own denim label, which she followed with  a sunglasses range in 2008. After appearing in a Marc Jacobs campaign she  launched her label to a handful of fashion insiders in New York, and won rave reviews from her most sceptical of critics. Since then her  designs have been worn by Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Jessica Parker and Gwyneth Paltrow. The publication has released the results of its reader poll, published to celebrate the magazine's tenth anniversary. Editor-in-chief  Jane Bruton said that Victoria's tenacity and hard work made her a worthy winner. She said: 'Ten years ago, we knew Victoria as a Spice Girl and one half of an A-list power couple. She made no secret of her love for fashion but was known for wearing, not creating it. Lena Dunham (left) topped the culture poll, while Malala Yousafzai is the most inspirational figure in politics . 'The thought of Victoria as a credible fashion designer seemed outlandish but boy did we underestimate her. 'Last year she won British Entrepreneur of the Year at the British Fashion Awards and opened her first store in London. Through sheer hard graft and business clout, VB has become a great fashion designer.' Fashion: Victoria Beckham . Culture: Lena Dunham . Entertainment: Emma Watson . Politics: Malala Yousafzai .

Technology: Zoe Sugg (Zoella) The poll saw 1,250 Grazia readers listing their most influential female figures in a survey online to mark a decade since the magazine launched. Harry Potter actress Emma Watson came top in the  entertainment category, ahead of Kim Kardashian and Beyonce, while GB athletic star Jessica Ennis-Hill topped the list of most influential women in sport. Girls' Lena Dunham was voted most influential woman in culture, beating off competition from the likes of JK Rowling, Hilary Mantel, Katherine Bigelow and Oprah Winfrey. The politics category saw 17-year-old schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai heralded; the UK-based student was the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for her campaigning work for the rights of the education of girls in her native Pakistan. Self-made millionaire Zoe Sugg, 24, aka Zoella, was named most influential woman in technology.","Mother-of-four praised for 'sheer hard graft' and 'business clout'

"Millions of mobile phone users could be at risk of having their private details shared after SIM cards provided to Telstra, Optus and Vodafone had their encryption keys stolen. The SIM cards were provided to the telco companies by Dutch digital security company Gemalto, who announced a few days ago they believe they had been hacked, according to a statement on their website. US and British spy agencies are said to have hacked into the chips and secured the encryption keys, giving them access to person information, texts and phone calls. This could means millions of SIM cards provided to the company may need to be recalled, as this is the only way to deal with the stolen encryption keys. Optus and Telstra both confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Gemalto was one of the vendors they source SIM cards from. Optus (left), Telstra (right), and Vodafone (not pictured) customers may have had their privacy compromised after SIM cards provided to the telco companies had their encryption keys stolen . The revelations come after Dutch digital security company Gemalto, who provide SIM cards to the companies, was apparently hacked by spy agencies . 'Optus uses a number of SIM vendors including Gemalto,' a spokesperson said. 'We are aware of the security allegation and are awaiting advice from Gemalto.' Telstra said they take their 'customers privacy and security very seriously', and revealed they too are working with the digital security company to decide their next move. 'Telstra sources SIM cards from multiple suppliers, including Gemalto, the world's biggest manufacturer of SIM cards', a spokesperson from Telstra confirmed. 'We're in contact with Gemalto and they are investigating the claims. We will work with Gemalto to address any issues they might identify. 'SIM card encryption is just one of multiple ways Telstra secures our network and the communications of our customers,' they also said. Gemalto is said to produce at least two billion SIM cards worldwide each year and their company motto boasts 'security to be free' Vodafone confirmed to Fairfax they too had  been affected, but none of the telco giants would divulge details on whether they would provide replacement SIMs to their customers. According to The Intercept, international companies such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint have also been impacted by the event. On Friday the online publication revealed claims that the hack was carried out by a joint unit of operatives from the NSA and its British counterpart Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). This stealing of the encryption keys would allow the agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and other operations, all without being detected. 'It enables them to bypass wiretapping restrictions, it doesn't require any special tool, you don't have to be very sophisticated to go through this decryption,' Linus Information Security Solutions director Mike Thompson told Fairfax.

"The White House confirmed on Monday that President Barack Obama doesn't plan to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference next week, held annually in Washington, D.C., and that no cabinet-level U.S. official is currently scheduled to make an appearance. The 'largest gathering of America's pro-Israel community,' according to the confab's organizations, AIPAC draws a crowd of roughly 14,000 attendees, many of whom are of Jewish heritage. The last time Obama showed up at the conference was in 2012 as he stared down reelection. Typically, a high-level administration official represents the U.S. at the mass gathering. But this year, supporters of Israel, a close ally of the U.S., may not receive that courtesy from the administration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set to make an in-person appearance. President Barack Obama doesn't plan to attend AIPAC's policy conference next week, his spokesman confirmed today, and admitted the White House hasn't decided whether to send a cabinet-level official at all . The president and his administration may snub the largest annual gathering of pro-Israel Americans in order to avoid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center right, who is pictured here on Monday with Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, center left. Netanyahu is up for reelection in a few weeks, and Obama is actively keep his distance until then . The president is refusing to meet with Netanyahu during his visit so that he does not appear to be endorsing the Israeli leader less than two weeks before his country heads to the polls. Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, two previous representatives sent by the administration, have scheduled foreign travel for next week. Biden will be in Uruguay and Guatemala, the White House has said. Kerry will also be out of the country, the State Department said last week, but wouldn't say where he will go or why. That will keep Biden away from Washington when Netanyahu addresses Congress, as well - the original purpose of his travel to the U.S. House Speaker John Boehner secretly invited the Israeli PM to appear before Congress this month. After announcing the overture, Boehner, a Republican, obliged however to a request from Netanyahu to move the rare, joint session of the upper and lower chambers of the legislative branch to March 3 so that he could attend AIPAC's policy conference. It also had the effect of putting the speech closer to Israel's election day. The change of plans has put the White House in the awkward position of having to decide whether it will snub the conference in order to avoid an encounter with Netanyahu. 'We are still in discussions with AIPAC about what sort of administration representation they'll have at the meeting,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told Daily Mail Online on Monday, adding that 1600 Pennsylvania is 'still evaluating the invitation.' The Associated Press first reported that the White House may skip this year's confab on Friday after an AIPAC official told the news agency that the administration had not yet responded to its invitation. The administration may dispatch Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the event, though, AP said. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has also been suggested to head the administration's delegation.","Typically, a high-level administration official represents the U.S. at AIPAC .

"A bride and groom didn't have much need for a dress code on their wedding invitations after filling their  guest list with 130 bridesmaids and 103 ushers. Amy Ewing, 26, and Alex Simmons, 32, from Leeds, decided to coincide their nuptials today with a double world record attempt, which left not a dry eye at the ceremony. The wedding is seeking to break two records; most ushers to one groom, currently 47, and most bridesmaids to one bride, currently 126. Scroll down for video . A world record wedding has taken place at Rudding Park Hotel in Harrogate North Yorkshire. Bride and groom Amy Ewing and Alex Simmonds smashed the previous Guiness World record for Bridesmaids and Ushers by having a massive 130 Bridesmaids and 103 Ushers. To beat the record,  Alex and charity worker Amy enlisted the help of 103 ushers and 130 bridesmaids, who all wore matching outfits. Their wedding planner Abbi Lewis, who runs Confetti & Lace bridal and Yorkshire Menswear in Leeds, was the one who came up with the plan. She said: 'We wanted to come up with a crazy idea.' 'I was looking through the world records in the Guinness book and there was one for most ushers which stood at 47 in Canada in 2003. 'It seemed a low number and we thought we could beat it easily. We are hoping to smash it by well over 50. So we have 100 booked in. 'Then I thought ""What about bridesmaids?"" The current world record was broken in 2013 at 126 bridesmaids.

Abbi continued: 'I am one of the 130 bridesmaids. We will all be wearing the same dress. They were specially made in the US and flown over three weeks ago. 'Since then we conducted more than 90 dress fittings. 'We had a terrible time measuring all the men's wear. All you could hear was sewing machines going at one point.' But she revealed that all Amy and Alex were really bothered about was each other. The couple have four children from previous relationships and are currently expecting a baby together.

"The teenage girl who survived a deadly axe-attack that killed three of her family suffered such severe brain damage she may never be able to tell investigators what happened. Marli van Breda, 16, was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home last month, but relatives have still not been allowed to see her. Visitors have been banned from the former Perth schoolgirl's hospital room in a bid to keep her 20-year-old brother Henri away, The Sunday Times reports. 'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told the South African newspaper. Scroll down for video . Marli van Breda, 16, suffered severe brain damage when she was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home last month . Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . Marli's mother Teresa, 54, was found dead on the balcony  and police discovered her deceased father Martin, 55, and brother Rudi, 22, in a bedroom. Henri escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town, on January 27. While Marli is awake and struggling to overcome her injuries, police fear she may not recover enough to provide a full account of the night she was attacked. She has recovered the ability to blink in response to questions, but police will have to rely on forensic evidence if they can't get a full statement from her. Marli's head is still heavily bandaged and she reportedly mumbles and cries when she sees photos of her parents and brother. 'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family told The Sunday Times. It emerged last month that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre. Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . While Marli is awake and struggling to overcome her injuries, police fear she may not recover enough to provide a full account of the night she was attacked . 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack. The young man's mental health has been under speculation since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were revealed to have been negative and no further testing occurred. A doctor who examined him following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to tik and his allowance had been cut off before his family were attacked. Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling. His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply hidden from the media's gaze. 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard. Devastated friends who knew the family in Australia paid tribute to the axe attack victims earlier this month. Deceased: Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch -  east of Cape Town . Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries . The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014. Rudi's friends have been leaving tributes on social media, with his university friend Afif Norzal saying: 'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend. 'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.' Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he returned to university for the final year of his Masters of Engineering. Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview: 'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me. 'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate. He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' A spokesman for the University of Melbourne released a statement saying: 'A Dean's honours list member for Science in 2011, Rudi was a keen sportsman and was highly regarded amongst his peers as a good-natured and friendly person, someone who was always willing to lend a hand and help out younger students.' Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-2014. He had been living at Trinity College where his brother was staying while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth. Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia: 'Teresa was a lovely mother... She was so happy all her children were with her, the boys had came from Australia (to visit). 'Henri moved back to South Africa in the middle of last year and he stayed with his family. She loved having him with her. She always used to tell me how wonderful it was.' Her husband Martin was the managing director of Engel and Voelkers Australia, an international property firm which has offices in Perth and Queensland. Friends described him as a 'great man' with a bright future ahead of him. Peter Armitage tweeted: '(He) was going to change SA (South Africa)... Folks, live for today. Tell people you love them today.' Mr Armitage said Martin was the founder of Netstar and Woodhill College. Martin's golf club also paid their 'deepest condolences' to the family on Twitter. Paul Freney, a friend and colleague of Martin's at Engel and Voelker,  told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife Teresa were committed parents to their three children. 'Committed parents' The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia .

"A council has come under fire after sending tenants an 'insulting' newsletter telling them to set aside money for court fine, cigarettes, Sky TV and lottery tickets. Crawley Borough Council sent the advice in a leaflet to thousands of council housing tenants - who reacted with fury at being treated like 'beer-swilling chavs' like TV's Frank Gallagher. The newsletter, which includes a reminder to residents that they have to pay their rent and council tax, was slammed by locals in the Sussex town as 'an insult' offering patronising advice. Leaflet: Crawley Borough Council told residents to save money for court fines and lottery tickets . The 12-page bulletin features a section titled 'Take control of your money', which states: 'Working out your budget is all about looking at what money you've got coming in and what you are spending.' It tells tenants to list all their expenditure, adding: 'Some things are more important than others so make sure you put these first. 'You need to pay your rent or you could lose your home. Electricity and gas bills need paying so you don't get cut off. If you don't pay your council tax you could go to prison. Court fines need paying too.' In a list of costs which could be incurred by tenants, the council mentions Sky or cable TV, lotteries, magistrates' court fines, cigarettes, tobacco, alcohol, haircuts and child maintenance payments. Anger: Residents claimed they were treated like Frank Gallagher, the layabout father from TV's Shameless . Local Will Davies, 28, said: 'The newsletter makes it sound like every council tenant is like Frank Gallagher in Shameless. 'Not everyone sits about watching Sky TV with a fag and a can of booze just waiting around until they have to go to court. 'The simple fact that the council included these items just goes to show what they think of their tenants - they think they're just chavs.' Another resident, Sarah Jarman, 41, said: 'This newsletter is an insult to everyone who lives in the town. 'We are not beer-swilling chavs waiting for a Lotto ticket to come in, but that's obviously what the council think of us.' Patronising: Crawley council has been accused of not taking its own town, pictured, seriously . Stephen Joyce, the Labour councillor responsible for housing, said that he would look into how the tactless newsletter came to be distributed. 'It doesn't sound right,' he said. 'If the entry for magistrates' court fines had been pointed out to me I would have queried it at the time. I also wouldn't be encouraging them to put money aside for cigarettes.' Councillor Duncan Crow, leader of the Conservative opposition, said the advice was 'inappropriate' and painted council tenants in a harsh light. 'It just struck me as being somewhat odd and, to be frank, rather insulting to suggest that falling foul of the law is a part of everyday life for our council tenants,' he said. A council spokesman said the advice was 'standard debt and budgeting advice', adding: 'There are lots of things in the list that will not apply to many council tenants but the list helps them to prioritise the most important payments.'","Crawley Borough Council sent newsletter to all tenants with money advice .

"The shamed marine who urinated on dead Taliban fighters was broken by the infamy that followed, his wife said after he was given a military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery. Rob Richards, 28, was given an armed salute and eulogy at the nation's most hallowed burial ground,  despite the 38-second video which ended his career. Richards, who served three tours in Afghanistan, was condemned by figures as senior as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when the footage emerged in 2012. Scroll down for video . Shamed: Rob Richards, pictured left and right with his wife Raechel, was given a military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery . Outrage: The video, which emerged in 2012, showed Richards and three other marines urinating on the bodies of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan . And, according to his wife Raechel, the aftermath sent him into a depression which ended in his death from an accidental overdose of prescription painkillers which built up in his body. Speaking to the Washington Post, she said: 'He felt backed into a corner. He always said, ""It’s all I’ll ever be known for.""' She described how his discharge after a court martial quashed his dreams of becoming a defense contractor, and sparked a drug addiction which led to the couple separating. They reunited after Richards finished drugs counseling - but just months later he was found dead at home. Doctors believe painkillers he was given had built up in his system leading to an overdose. Burial: Richards's cremated remains, held in the above box by Raechel, were laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, in a military ceremony . Hallowed ground: Richards was buried in Arlington, for which he was eligible as he was not dishonorably discharged after his court martial . Respect: These seven U.S. marines fired a volley in remembrance of Richards at the Arlington ceremony . Honored: Raechel Richards is handed an American flag by comrades of Richards at the funeral . The funeral took place in mid-February at the Virginia burial ground, and was attended by some 300 mourners, as well as family members. He was given an armed salute by seven riflemen, and a musical tribute by an army bugler. A chaplain at the ceremony said Richards: 'served with honor... gave so much...  and bled for our freedom'. He described Arlington as a 'fitting' place for his cremated remains, held in a metal box marked with military designs, to rest. According to military rules, any veteran is eligible for their cremated remains to be buried at Arlington - so long as they were not dishonorably discharged. Thanks to a plea deal made at his court martial, Richards was allowed an honorable discharge, so long as he took a demotion and left the army straight away - leaving the door open for an Arlington ceremony. After the ceremony, members of his platoon attempted to justify the actions of Richards and three other marines who appeared in the footage. Justification: At an event after the ceremony, comrades of Richards attempted to justify the actions . One, Sergeant Edward Deptola, described how the sniper team had hunted down the Taliban members. The fighters were suspected of laying roadside bombs which blew a leg off one of their comrades - which militants later hung from a tree as a grim warnings. They opened fire from 50 yards away, Deptola said, and were angry and jubilant at the kill when one suggested they urinate on them . Deptola said they did it 'because killing them wasn't enough. That wasn't enough justice.' Richards had earlier defended himself, saying in 2013: 'When you're under that much stress and in that environment, your whole mental being changes. 'You're no longer Joe the family man. You're a warrior, and if you read back to Biblical wars and wars since the dawn of time, men have been doing this to men for millennia.'","Rob Richards, 28, was buried at hallowed Virginia cemetery this month .

"A Utah man won a Benihana competition after making hundreds of visits to the restaurant chain - and reportedly lost twenty pounds along the way. Benihana is going to award loyal customer Jack King for the multiple 2014 visits he made, it emerged last week. King, with 579 Benihana trips, won the restaurant company's 2014 Passport Challenge, according to reports. Loyal customer: Jack King reportedly made 579 trips to Benihana locations last year . He took the top spot in the contest's division for overall restaurant trips, according to theSalt Lake Tribune. King, 51, told the newspaper 'I normally go four times a week. It's Salt Lake's best-kept secret for lunch. It's the same meal you get at dinner only slightly smaller portion.' The 2014 Passport Challenge also featured a division for visiting individual U.S. Benihanas, the newspaper reported. Benihana told the Salt Lake Tribune that approximately 19,000 people participated. According the newspaper, Benihana is going to award King with two prizes: a gift card worth $1,000 and a trip for King and a guest to a U.S. Benihana location he gets to pick out. Salt Lake City Benihana general manager Susan Gutierrez told the newspaper 'He was here almost every day anyway, so we said, ""Jack, you've got to do this."" He got it in his head that he was going to win the contest, and he did.' According to Benihana, approximately 19,000 people participated in the company's 2014 Passport Challenge . King went to Benihana for dinner and snacks when he was unable to eat lunch there, the newspaper reported. King explained another tactic for racking up visits to ABC News, saying 'I went seven days a week this year. And if I was out of town in a bigger market, I’d hit a couple a day.' Another manager for the Salt Lake location, TJ Chagzoetsang, told the news outlet 'Jack is a regular and a very nice customer. We had quite a few people participate, but in our region nobody came even close to him. We’re very happy for him.' The total cost for King's 579 visits came to approximately $6,900, ABC News reported. King explained to the website 'Average meal with tip is about $12 and anytime I go eat out for lunch anyway it’s $7 to $15 anywhere, so I think it’s good value for the money and I think they do a good job and keep things pretty healthy.' ABC News reported that King may take his trip to the Anchorage, Alaska, Benihana, with the location in Key West, Florida being another option.","Jack King, with 579 trips to Benihana locations, won Benihana's 2014 Passport Challenge .

"The winners of this year's Oscars have moved us to tears, laughter, fear and agony. But how can actors produce experiences that not only engage our imaginations, but that feel real? Neuroscientist, Jeffrey Zacks, believes it's all down to two simple rules which he has dubbed the 'mirror rule' and the 'success rule.' How can actors produce experiences that not only engage our imaginations, but that feel real? Neuroscientist, Jeffrey Zacks, believes it's all down to two simple rules which he has dubbed the 'mirror rule' and the 'success rule.' Pictured is Eddie Redmayne, winner of the award for best actor at this year's Oscars . The mirror rule describes the powerful - yet often subconscious - compulsion to do the same thing that those around us are doing. It explains why our body language tends to mirror those around us, why we're prone to laugh or cry, to smile or grimace as we watch someone else do the same, regardless of whether these actions are occurring in real life or on a movie screen. The success rule tells us to 'do what has worked' in the past. In real life, we've learned to duck when flying objects approach us, to prepare to fight or flee when faced with danger, and we bring these same habits with us when we experience a film. It's the success rule, Professor Zacks said, that explains why film goers might find themselves ducking a bit in their seats when the Jabberwock's head falls in Tim Burton's film version of 'Alice in Wonderland.' The mirror rule describes the powerful compulsion to do the same thing that those around us are doing. It explains why our body language tends to mirror those around us, why we're prone to cry, to smile or grimace as we watch someone else do the same, regardless of whether its in a film or in real life . 'One of the striking things about understanding movies is that you come into the theatre with the brain that you evolved over three-and-a-half billion years to understand the real world' he said. 'For the most part, your brain just treats what it's seeing on the screen as if it were real,' added the Washington University professor. In his book 'Flicker,' Professor Zacks explores how film-making commandeers these and other human traits to make the viewing experience so emotional. If you cry at sad scenes in films, tweet and post emotional links and jump to help the less fortunate, you could be genetically predisposed to 'sensory processing sensitivity', researchers say. California researchers have found that up to 20 per cent of people are affected, having a highly sensitive brain that responds to emotional images. The researchers used fMRI scans to monitor the level of empathy - and say the emotion levels are particularly high if pictures of partners smiling are shown. Stony Brook University psychologists Arthur and Elaine Aron say roughly 20 per cent of the population is affected by sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity, or responsiveness, to environmental and social stimuli. In a study last year, the University of California found that Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of brains provide physical evidence that the 'highly sensitive' brain responds powerfully to emotional images. According to Dr Arthur Aron, lead author, the trait is becoming increasingly associated with identifiable behaviors, genes, physiological reactions, and patterns of brain activation. Highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli, process information more thoroughly, and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli, the researchers say. 'We're learning more and more about what makes a film gripping, what makes it engaging,' Professor Zacks said. Yet Professor Zacks does not see science replacing aesthetics. '(Science) can't tell us if it's good or bad,' he said. 'It might be able to tell us something about what's going to be popular or not. 'The most important thing that we can do as psychologists and neurophysiologists for filmmakers is to tell them, 'If you make this choice, here's what's going to happen.' 'Then as a filmmaker, you still have to decide, 'Is this what I want to happen, is that aesthetically pleasing, is that satisfying or not?'","Jeffrey Zacks believes it's down the 'mirror rule' and the 'success rule'

"Faced with the possibility that Congress may not come to an agreement to fund the Department of Homeland Security by Friday midnight, President Barack Obama on Monday warned a group of governors on Monday that temporarily shuttering the government agency's doors 'will have a direct impact on America’s national security.' And over the weekend while speaking at a briefing during the National Governors Association meeting, Homeland Security Chief Jeh Johnson cautioned that 'we are greatly compromised' by a shutdown. Separately, the Justice Department argued on Monday that the country could face 'irreparable harm' if a Texas judge's injunction on the presidents immigration orders were kept in effect. But the White House on Monday afternoon had a tough time detailing specific aspects of national security that would be threatened if either situation came to pass. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama delivers remarks to the National Governors Association in the State Dining Room of the White House on Monday. Obama told warned the governors on Monday that temporarily shuttering the Department of Homeland Security's doors 'will have a direct impact on America’s national security' With regards to Congress, the president said Monday that if the legislative branch doesn't send him a bill he can sign, more than 100,000 DHS employees, including Border Patrol agents, port inspectors, and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents 'will show up to work without getting paid.' Characterizing the dispute as another one of the 'manufactured crises and self-inflicted wounds' imposed by Congress 'that have so often bogged us down over the last five years,' Obama told governors on Monday that workers are 'not going to be able to spend that money in your states' if they don't receive a paycheck. 'It will have a direct impact on your economy, and it will have a direct impact on America’s national security, because their hard work helps to keep us safe. 'And as governors, you know that we can’t afford to play politics with our national security,' he told them. Congressional Republicans are holding up funding for the Department of Homeland Security over the president's November directive to the agency to stop deporting more than 4 million non-violent illegal immigrants who meet certain criteria. The House has passed legislation to give DHS the money to continue operations - but only if doesn't enforce Obama's mandate. Democrats have blocked the bill from proceeding through the Senate multiple times. They again filibustered the legislation on Monday evening. The White House has said it would veto legislation that undermines the president's executive actions on immigration, anyway, putting another hurdle in the way of the GOP-backed bill. If the House and Senate do not pass identical legislation by a Feb. 28, a legally-mandated deadline imposed by Congress last December, or the White House doesn't approve the bill they come up with, DHS will partially shut down. All employees who are deemed non-essential will be sent home, and those that are seen as essential will be kept on the job without pay until the conflict is resolved. Politico reports that a DHS shutdown would have the immediate effect of 30,000 employees being sent home without pay. The news publication put the number of employees who would have to stay on - even though they won't be paid for that work until a later date - at 200,000. Asked by Daily Mail Online on Monday afternoon what 'direct impact' a DHS shutdown would have on national security, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, 'is that people who will be showing up to protect our borders, to protect our ports of entry including our airports, individuals who are responsible for keeping the machinery moving in terms of responding to natural disasters, and responding to requests for assistance from states when they put forward requests for financial assistance, that those kind of day-to-day operations are affected.' 'In some cases it just means that there is personnel who are not receiving paychecks. In some cases we're talking about personnel who are working on these important matters who are being furloughed,' he contended. He later told another reporter that just because some employees are categorized as non-essential, doesn't mean they really are. These may not be people who are 'instantly recognizable to the American public,' he said, but they do play an important role in protecting our Homeland Security. In his response to Daily Mail Online, Earnest said national security would also be threatened because DHS' ability 'to plan for the future and to implement new procedures and programs' would be negatively impacted. Cyber security could also be threatened, Earnest said, as that issue falls primarily under DHS's domain. 'I think it's very hard for anybody to make the case – and I don't think anybody really has – that stopping funding for the Department of Homeland Security somehow enhances our national security,' he told Daily Mail Online during his daily briefing. 'And I think everybody would acknowledge that it's going to have an impact and it's not going to be a positive one,' which is why Congress should fully fund DHS for the full fiscal year, he added. At a press conference on Monday Johnson argued that cutting headquarters staff 'back to a skeleton' would inhibit DHS' 'ability to stay on top of a lot of the existing situations and challenges to homeland security right now.' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, joined by the department employees, said Monday that Congress to pass a full-year appropriations bill for DHS. Failing to fund DHS impacts our personnel and their families, he said in addition to national security . Regardless of whether Homeland Security remains fully up and running it cannot legally set to work on implementing Obama's mandates at present, because a judge in Texas last week granted 26 states - many of whom's governors participated in White House-sponsored events held in conjunction with the NGA meeting this weekend - seeking a reprieve a preliminary injunction that Homeland Security has said it will abide by. The Department of Justice on Monday requested a stay from the judge, Andrew Hanen of Brownsville, Texas, while it appeals his decision. Hannen, a Republican-appointed judge, is not expected to cede the Obama administration's request. In his earlier decision he said he believes the plaintiffs, Texas specifically, would 'suffer irreparable harm in this case' if Obama's executive actions were allowed to take effect. The Department of Justice said Monday it believes that not allowing the DHS to proceed with its plans to place illegal immigrants who apply for the proposed programs under review would cause 'irreparable harm' not only to those people but to national security. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Monday, 'The administration believes that a stay should be granted because the judge's ruling in this case only makes it harder for the Department of Homeland Security to protect the American people and bring much needed accountability to our nation's immigration system.' He argued that measures Obama put in place 'would bring greater accountability to our immigration system' because they 'would bring millions of people out of the shadows,' force them to pay taxes and to go through background checks. And that, he said, would make the country safer.","Obama on Monday warned that temporarily shuttering the department's doors 'will have a direct impact on America’s national security'

A set of new emoji characters will also be unveiled, including racially diverse families and same-sex families, according to The Next Web. Leaked images also show a wider range of country flags under the Travel and Places tab, with this emoji set now including flags from 32 countries . Last year, Apple revealed it was working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone. Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them. Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Japanese electronic messages and webpages, whose use is spreading outside Japan. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means ""picture"" (e) + ""letter"" (moji). Icons are standardised, and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese curry, and sushi. Some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could noww be added. Because Emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium. The disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue. Apple's Katie Cotton, who was the head of communications at the firm at the time, replied, telling MTV: 'Tim forwarded your email to me. We agree with you. 'Our emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms. 'There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard.' The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard. 'Of the more than 800 Emoji, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says. 'There's a white boy, girl, man, woman, elderly man, elderly woman, blonde boy, blonde girl and, we're pretty sure, [video game character] Princess Peach.' A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard. 'But when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys, there's a staggering lack of minority representation.' It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones. Previously, the list of characters contained dozens of faces of people that appear to be white. However, only two of the symbols seem to be Asian and none are black. The new emoj are being trialled on OS X 10.10.3 and iOS 8.3 beta 2 now.

"Course: Esther Okade has been accepted to study for a maths degree - despite not going to school . She spends her spare time in a similar way to many other ten-year-old girls - playing with Barbie dolls and making loom bands. But the key difference between Esther Okade and other children her age is that she has been accepted to study for a university maths degree - despite not going to school. Esther, from Walsall, West Midlands, has enrolled on an Open University course months after she passed her A-levels - and wants to study for a PhD before running her own bank. The girl, who gained a C grade in her maths GCSE aged six, has joined the course which started this month. Her younger brother Isiah is already studying for his A-levels - also aged six. The siblings are both home-schooled by their mother Omonefe, who has converted the living room of their semi-detached, three-bedroom house into a makeshift classroom. Mathematician Mrs Okade, 37, said: ‘Esther is doing so well. She took a test recently and scored 100 per cent. Applying to the university was an interesting process because of her age. ‘We even had to talk to the vice-chancellor. After they interviewed her they realised that this has been her idea from the beginning. From the age of seven Esther has wanted to go to university. Happy: Esther (left) is pictured last year with her mother Omonefe (right) after passing her A-level in maths . Following in her footsteps: The schoolgirl (left and right) is pictured at home in Walsall with her brother Isaiah . ‘But I was afraid it was too soon. She would say, “Mum, when am I starting?”, and go on and on and on. Finally, after three years she told me, “Mum, I think it is about time I started university now”.’ Mrs Okade added that Esther - who will study for her degree at home - was ‘flying’ and ‘so happy’ when she was accepted by the university, and wants to be a millionaire. She said: ‘For now we want her to enjoy her childhood as well as her maths. By the time she was four I had taught her the alphabet, her numbers, and how to add, subtract, multiply and division. ‘I saw that she loved patterns so developed a way of using that to teach her new things. I thought I would try her with algebra, and she loved it more than anything.’ Another bright spark: In 1981 Ruth Lawrence (above) from Brighton became the youngest person to pass the exam for Oxford University, as a ten-year-old - and graduated aged 13 with a first-class degree in maths . Esther stunned her parents last year when she achieved a B grade in her pure maths A-level. She applied to the Open University last August - and after a phone interview, an essay and an exam, she was told in December that she had been accepted onto the course. Her father Paul, 42, a managing director, added: ‘I cannot tell you how happy and proud I am as a father. The desire of every parent is to see their children exceed them, and take the family name to great heights, and my children have done just that.’ In 1981 Ruth Lawrence, of Brighton, became the youngest person to pass the exam for Oxford University, as a ten-year-old - and graduated aged 13 with a first-class degree in maths. Now aged 43 and a married mother-of-two, Mrs Lawrence is an associate professor of maths at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.","Esther Okade from Walsall has enrolled on Open University course .

"A major breakthrough in testing for pre-eclampsia — a condition which costs the lives of 1,000 unborn babies in Britain every year — could save many families from suffering this huge loss. Pre-eclampsia, where a defect with the placenta causes blood pressure to soar, is still impossible to cure. But more reliable testing means more babies should survive, and fewer women given distressing and dangerous precautionary treatment — such as very early delivery — after inaccurate test results. Risky death: Heidi Livesey was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia. Her daughter Ebony weighed just 1lb 1oz and while Heidi’s condition improved, Ebony remained in intensive care for four months . Heidi Livesey knows all too well how the condition can strike — 25 weeks into her first pregnancy, everything seemed fine. Yes, the previous week her blood pressure had been slightly raised and her midwife suggested a further check, but she had no idea how much danger she and her baby were in. In fact, that second check probably saved both their lives. She was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia. This can lead to dangerously high blood pressure in the mother, increasing her risk of stroke, seizures, heart failure and organ failure, which threaten the lives of mother and baby. ‘I hadn’t had any of the common symptoms, such as swelling around the feet and ankles, and headaches,’ recalls Heidi, 36, an ambulance technician from Nottingham. The only possible signs were a little dizziness and rib pain. But at the second check, her blood pressure reading was even higher than before, and she was sent straight to hospital. There, it continued rising and three days later, the doctors’ only option was to deliver her daughter by Caesarean, four months early. This is the only way to stop pre-eclampsia, but doctors could not be sure if mother and child would make it. Thousands of babies are delivered early to prevent the condition worsening and around 1,000 die because of pre-eclampsia every year . Heidi’s daughter Ebony weighed just 1lb 1oz and while Heidi’s condition improved, Ebony remained in intensive care for four months. Now aged three, she is still prone to chest infections, coughs and colds. One in ten women develops pre-eclampsia during their first pregnancy. For one in 100, such as Heidi, it is a serious condition. When the placenta stops working properly, the body releases toxic substances to the lining of blood vessels. As a result, the blood vessel lining — the endothelium — becomes inflamed, which damages organs and causes them to fail. Signs of pre-eclampsia include high blood pressure, headaches, swelling and visual disturbances. It can also restrict the baby’s growth as the placenta supplies nutrients and oxygen from the mother’s blood. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Thousands of babies are delivered early to prevent the condition worsening and around 1,000 die because of pre-eclampsia every year, either because the failing placenta means their life-support is cut off or they are delivered too early to survive. Experts still don’t understand why this condition occurs, although risk factors include pre-existing high blood pressure, IVF, kidney disease, diabetes, a twin pregnancy, first pregnancy, increased age, being overweight and previous pre-eclampsia. The test correctly identified 96 per cent of women with pre-eclampsia, sharply up from the 58 to 76 per cent detected with current methods . ‘However, these are all associations and we still don’t know exactly why the placenta stops working properly, and why only some women develop it,’ says Dr Cathy Nelson-Piercy, a professor of obstetric medicine at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, and chair of trustees for charity Action On Pre-Eclampsia. Women identified as being at high risk are put on low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks of pregnancy. But doctors have no clear way of telling which women can safely be monitored and which will get swiftly worse, leading to thousands of early deliveries. But a new blood test, developed by British doctors and being introduced in some hospitals, could revolutionise treatment and save lives by identifying the worst cases. Professor Andrew Shennan, a consultant obstetrician at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, who did the research into the test, says it will ‘radically change how we manage these women’. The Alere test, which gives results in 15 minutes, measures levels of a protein known as placental growth factor (PLGF), which increases during pregnancy. A one-year study with 625 women with suspected pre-eclampsia found that those with a very low PLGF level had severe pre-eclampsia, while those with high levels were very unlikely to have a severe form even if they had symptoms, and could safely carry their baby until full term. The test correctly identified 96 per cent of women with the condition, sharply up from the 58 to 76 per cent detected with current methods. For women like Heidi, it could make all the difference when considering having a second baby. action-on-pre-eclampsia.org.uk, tommys.org .","Pre-eclampsia costs the lives of 1,000 unborn babies in Britain every year .

"Troubled bank HSBC announced a 17 per cent fall in annual profits today but still managed to make more than £12.1billion last year. Its annual results for 2014 were almost £3billion worse than in 2013 but it still made around £33million a day and paid its staff £2.3billion in bonuses. Britain's biggest bank is embroiled in an ongoing row over allegations that its Swiss private banking arm helped thousands of wealthy clients avoid tax. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said today the bank 'disappointed' last year and was forced to set aside cash to deal with the Swiss scandal as well as other fines and disputes. This morning shares plummeted by 30p to £5.73 when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Drop: Worldwide super-bank HSBC, which is based in London, pictured, has announced a 17% drop in annual pre-tax profits to £12.1 billion . Allegations: Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . Ex-director of public prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald said HSBC could face criminal charges in the UK after revelations its Swiss private bank helped clients dodge tax.  The Financial Conduct Authority is currently looking into the scandal. Lord Macdonald said there is evidence 'that HSBC Swiss and/or its employees have engaged over many years in systematic and profitable collusion in serious criminal activity.' Stuart Gulliver's total pay package for 2014 was £7.6million, including a bonus of just under £1.3 million. This is down from last year's bonus of £1.8million. is. It is not tied directly to performance and as a result does not count as a bonus under new European rules preventing bankers from being paid bonuses worth more than two times their salary. Mr Gulliver's previous pay scheme offered an annual bonus worth up to three times his salary. Overall across the bank in 2014 staff received £2.38billion in bonuses, down from £2.5billion. It came amid claims that Mr Gulliver himself sheltered millions of pounds in a Swiss bank account. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax . The 55-year-old's bonuses were paid through an anonymous company registered in Panama to a Swiss account until 2003, according to the Guardian. Stuart Gulliver was last night accused of using the same HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland that helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax. Last Sunday Mr Gulliver personally signed a 'sincere apology' published in several newspapers. The chief executive, who grew up in Plymouth, has spent three decades with HSBC. He was in charge of global banking and markets when the Swiss scandal was at its peak from 2005 to 2007. According to The Guardian, Mr Gulliver was listed as the beneficial owner of an account in the name of Worcester Equities Inc. It was through this that his HSBC bonuses were paid until 2003. The files also show he held a second account in the name of Worcester Foundation, which was closed before 2007. His representatives said he used HSBC Suisse to hold his bonus payments before 2003, when he moved from Hong Kong to London. They said tax had been paid on this income, adding that the Swiss accounts had been voluntarily declared to UK tax authorities for a number of years. A representative said: 'Our client has become a permanent Hong Kong resident with right of abode.' The Oxford graduate is also domiciled in Hong Kong for legal and tax purposes – despite being born in Derby and based in the UK at HSBC's headquarters. Mr Gulliver, who became chief executive in 2011, has pledged to reform HSBC following the scandal. He admitted that 2014 had been a challenging year, with profits down due to a number of one-off factors including the settlement of regulatory fines. He added: 'Profits disappointed, although a tough fourth quarter masked some of the progress made over the preceding three quarters. 'Many of the challenging aspects of the fourth-quarter results were common to the industry as a whole.' In relation to the Swiss tax scandal, HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said the bank needed to reinforce controls and demonstrate their effectiveness. He added: 'We deeply regret and apologise for the conduct and compliance failures highlighted, which were in contravention of our own policies as well as expectations of us.' The bank was also the subject of a £216 million fine from the Financial Conduct Authority relating to HSBC's failure to prevent the rigging of foreign exchange operations. Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: 'People will be astounded that bonuses of this size are still being paid out after the revelations of the last few days. 'This underlines Labour's determination to repeat the tax on bank bonuses in order to fund a jobs programme for young people. We also need wider reform of the banking industry, including extending clawback of bank bonuses to at least ten years in cases where there has been inappropriate behaviour. 'And George Osborne still has serious questions to answer over the HSBC scandal including what the government did when it first received these files in May 2010 and over the appointment of Lord Green as a Conservative Minister.'","HSBC's annual results for 2014 are around £3billion worse than in 2013 .

"Edward Snowden's girlfriend Lindsay Mills joined director Laura Poitras on stage after Citizenfour won the Academy Award for best documentary feature on Sunday night. Snowden, a National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified US government documents, congratulated director Poitras for the win later that night. Snowden said that, although he had at first been 'extremely reluctant', he was grateful Poitras had persuaded him to be a part of the film. Scroll down for videos .

Edward Snowden pictured with Lindsay Mills during a trip to the theatre in Moscow in 2014 . Mills once described Edward Snowden as her 'man of mystery' During her acceptance speech, Poitras thanked Snowden 'for his courage' and said she shared the award with 'other journalists who are exposing the truth' Mills also joined the Citizenfour team at the Independent Spirit Awards, where they won best documentary . 'The result is a brave and brilliant film that deserves the honor and recognition it has received,' he wrote in a statement released through the American Civil Liberties Union. 'My hope is that this award will encourage more people to see the film and be inspired by its message that ordinary citizens, working together, can change the world.' During her acceptance speech, Poitras thanked Snowden 'for his courage' and said she shared the award with 'other journalists who are exposing the truth'. She added that Snowden's disclosures in the film reveal threats not only to democracy, 'but to our lives ourselves'. Mills, a pole dancer who lived with Snowden, 31, before he fled the United States, moved to Moscow, Russia, after he received asylum there last year . Silent treatment: Mills has never spoken publicly about the Snowden scandal . Snowden congratulated director Laura Poitras after her film Citizenfour won the Academy Award for best documentary feature on Sunday night . 'The more important decisions being made affecting all of us are made in secret,' she said on the Oscar stage. 'We lose our ability to check the powers that control.' Poitras also shared the stage with journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was a collaborator on the film. After Poitras left the stage, ceremony host Neil Patrick Harris joked: 'Edward couldn't be here for some treason.' Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted asylum. US officials have promised to prosecute him if they are ever able to take him into custody. Citizenfour beat Finding Vivian Maier, Last Days In Vietnam, The Salt Of The Earth and Virunga. It is Poitras' first Oscar win. She was previously nominated for her film, 'My Country, My Country' Because of the sensitive nature of the footage, Poitras made Citizenfour under intense secrecy and edited it in Germany. The film shows glimpses of the former NSA contractor's paranoia. When room service calls his room, Snowden unplugs his phone and he ducks under a blanket to enter passwords on his laptop. Yet Snowden says in the film, and has repeated his sentiment since, that he was willing to be the target of criticism and derision and branded a traitor. 'If you're not willing to be called some bad names to serve your country, you really don't care that much about your country,' Snowden said at a forum earlier this month. 'So bring the names on.' One scene in the film shows Snowden cooking with Mills in their wood-paneled Moscow apartment, which is decorated with plants. Snowden said that, although he had at first been 'extremely reluctant', he was grateful Poitras (pictured with Mathilde Bonnefoy and Dirk Wilutzky) had persuaded him to be a part of the film . Last year Snowden admitted in a webcam interview at the New Yorker Festival that he misses America - a place he may never return to, Politico reported. 'The question is what don't I miss, whether it's my family, whether it's my home, whether it's my friends, whether it's my work at the agency, I was fulfilled and happy,' he said. 'Things as simple as having my old beat-up car, there's a lot to miss. It's a great country.' On her blog in 2013, after Snowden fled to Hong Kong following the leak, Mills dotingly called him her ‘man of mystery’ who she had followed around the world for the last four years. Mills wrote: 'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass. 'As I type this on my tear-streaked keyboard I’m reflecting on all the faces that have graced my path. 'The ones I laughed with. The ones I’ve held. The one I’ve grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu. ‘But sometimes life doesn’t afford proper goodbyes.'","Lindsay Mills joined director Laura Poitras after Citizenfour won .

"A family lost their Jack Russell terrier in a house fire sparked by sun rays shining a Nutella jar. Investigators believe the blaze - which gutted an entire bedroom - started when low winter sunlight was refracted by the glass jar on a window sill. It is thought the rays were magnified by the jar, which was being used to store loom bands, and beamed onto nearby blinds, causing them to catch fire. A family lost their Jack Russell terrier after a large house fire was sparked by sun rays shining a Nutella jar . The blaze gutted an entire bedroom on the first floor of the property in Twickenham, south west London . There was also damage to the roof after the fire started on February 15 while the family were out . The family were not home at the time but their pet, named Chili, was trapped inside the house in Twickenham, south west London, and died. Declan Murphy said he was out celebrating his anniversary with wife Lindsay and their two children at the time of the blaze. He told Get West London they were 'heartbroken' at the death of the dog, adding: 'We've been told it will be up to a year before the house is ready for us to move back into.' The electrical supervisor, 41, added: 'I want to ensure other people are aware of the dangers and know to keep glass items away from windows and out of direct sunlight so they don't have to go through anything like this. The fire, on February 15, destroyed a bedroom on the first floor and the roof was also damaged. Investigators believe the blaze started when low winter sunlight was refracted by the glass jar on a window sill . It is thought the rays were magnified by the jar and beamed onto nearby blinds, causing them to catch fire . Declan Murphy, who lived there with his wife and children, said they're 'heartbroken' at the death og their dog . Charlie Pugsley, of London Fire Brigade, warned people to make sure their window ledges are clear before leaving home. He said: 'It sounds far fetched that a jar containing a few rubber bands caused a severe house fire but that's exactly what happened. 'It's worth spending five minutes checking that your window ledges are clear of any glass or crystal that might lead to a potentially life changing blaze.' Last week, lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone told how a fire broke out at her home in similar circumstances. She wrote on Twitter: 'OMG sun coming through the window, bean bag next to mirror table...bean bag has just gone on fire. Incredible how a house fire can start.' Ms Mone put the fire out herself and firefighters did not attend. Sun rays have caused 125 fires in the last five years, according to the London Fire Brigade, and warned they are a risk in the winter as well as the summer. Mr Pugsley added the figures show that these sorts of incidents are 'not an urban myth'. Mr Murphy added: 'We've been told it will be up to a year before the house is ready for us to move back into' Sun rays have caused 125 fires in the last five years and are as much of a risk in the winter as the summer .

"Two elderly men escaped with minor injuries when their light aircraft crashed and ‘cartwheeled’ down a runway today, before splitting in two. The single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane landed upside down after plunging onto an airfield during high winds at about midday in Shotteswell, Warwickshire. On arrival paramedics found the pilot and his passenger had freed themselves from the aircraft - and they were not seriously hurt. Only one of the men, in his 70s, required hospital treatment. Crash: The single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane landed upside down  in Shotteswell, Warwickshire . Minor injuries: On arrival paramedics found the pilot and his passenger had freed themselves from the plane . The pilot told fire crews that he had been caught in a strong crosswind during a routine landing exercise, which made the wing hit the ground first and the aircraft cartwheel down the runway. Local resident Paul Fisher, 44, said: ‘I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the wreckage and they had survived. How they have walked away from that is beyond me.’ Another resident, who did not want to be named, added: ‘We got home after it happened and saw lots of blue flashing lights. I'm glad it sounds like the people involved are going to be okay.’ Warwickshire Police said the injured man was airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for treatment, and added that the B4100 road nearby had since reopened after a temporary closure. Upside down: The pilot said that he had been caught in a strong crosswind during a routine landing exercise . Probe: The Air Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating the incident, which happened at midday . And a Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ‘Although the pictures are very dramatic, one pilot has suffered a broken leg with the other walked away with only cuts and bruises. ‘On arrival the ambulance service had already been able to release the two casualties. Firefighters then had to make the aircraft safe as it was leaking fuel.’ The Air Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating. The other man is in his late 60s. Shotteswell, which has been in use since the Second World War, has a grass runway of just under half a mile. It is regularly used by private aircraft, helicopters, microlights and training flights. The Met Office has a severe yellow 'be aware' weather warning for wind in place today and tomorrow - although this only covers western Scotland and the north of Northern Ireland.","Single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane landed upside down today .

"A grieving mother whose newborn baby died six months ago is facing fresh heartbreak as she prepares to say goodbye to her terminally ill husband but says he can be a 'daddy in heaven'. Kelly Francis from Cedar Springs, Michigan, was shocked when her college sweetheart Jake was diagnosed with cancer, just months after they started dating in 2004. But Mr Francis beat the disease after receiving chemotherapy treatement and the couple were married in 2007. Kelly and Jake Francis with their son Evan. The couple's daughter Avery died shortly after birth and now Mr Francis has been told he only has five months to live after being diagnosed with cancer . Baby Avery who died shortly after birth. Mrs Francis was told just 17 weeks into her pregnancy that Avery had multicycstic dysplastic kidneys, which prevented her lungs from growing . However, by 2009, Mr Francis was diagnosed with a different form of testicular cancer and told that it couldn't be cured. The couple then decided to have a child together, even though they knew that one day Mrs Francis would have to raise the baby on her own and found out she was expecting twins. Mrs Francis told WXMI: 'I was so overwhelmed and blessed of course and feeling so grateful that I had two children. 'But, I was scared because I knew someday I’d be raising them on my own.' But just 17 weeks into her pregnancy, she was told her unborn daughter Avery had multicycstic dysplastic kidneys, which prevented her lungs from growing. Mrs Francis knew that when she fell pregnant she would become a single mother after Mr Francis had been told his testicular cancer was terminal . Their son Evan was born healthy although Avery died shortly after birth. But rather than looking to the future with their new baby, the couple are now having to contend with the fact Mr Francis has been given just five months to live. Mrs Francis is now a stay-at-home mother and also has to care for her husband who is now unable to continue his work as a nurse. But even though after his death the family will be physically separated, Mrs Francis says they still consider themselves as lucky. Mrs Francis told her terminally ill husband that he will get to be a father in heaven to Avery while she will look after Evan here . She told Fox 6: 'I feel like we were blessed with twins because Jake is too good of a father not to be one in heaven. 'He gets Avery in heaven and I get Evan here.' Now the local community are rallying around the couple and raising money for them so they can enjoy as much time as possible together. The couple's friend and fundraiser McKenzie Pepper said: 'It would be amazing to give them the gift of time, together as a family, so that Kelly doesn’t have to worry about working. 'So, they can spend as much time together with Evan.'","Jake Francis from Michigan was diagnosed with terminal testicular cancer .

"Foreign marathoners who were hoping to join the ranks of the few who have competed in a race in North Korea’s capital have had their hopes dashed. A number of travel agencies which operate tours to Pyongyang said they have been informed that North Korea has banned foreign runners - both amateur and professional - from participating in this year’s event due to Ebola fears within the secretive nation. No Ebola cases have been reported in North Korea or anywhere near it, and its state media have suggested that the deadly virus was created by the US military as a biological weapon. Scroll down for video . Foreign runners were hoping to compete in the North Korean capital's marathon for only the second time . Travel agencies said  the race has been closed to amateur and professional runners from abroad . North Korea implemented some of the toughest Ebola-related travel restrictions in the world last October when it banned foreign tourists over fears that the virus could spread into the isolated country. The annual Pyongyang marathon is a popular tourist event, with hundreds of foreign runners signing up for April’s race. In a statement, Koryo Tours, a Beijing-based, British-run firm, said it was alerted by its North Korean partners. It said: ‘We were told that this is due to the ongoing precautions that the country has put in place in relation to fears held there over the Ebola virus. The annual marathon is a popular tourist event, with hundreds of foreign runners signing up for April’s race . North Korea's media have suggested that Ebola was created by the US military as a biological weapon . ‘It is still unclear when the borders will be reopened, but we were also advised not to cancel our March tours, and to expect an update on the border situation at the end of February.’ The company had been selling tours, which included the marathon, for between £580 (approximately $900) and, £1,240 ($1,900). Its co-founder, Nick Bonner, said he did not think the decision reflected any deeper problems in North Korea’s government, though the news comes amid reports leader Kim Jong-Un has called for increased combat readiness and, at a meeting of senior party and military leaders, described tensions on the peninsula as graver than ever before. One tour operator said it had signed up more than 400 foreign runners to compete in the Pyongyang race . Despite North Korea's travel ban, the Pyongyang marathon will go ahead with local runners . Bonner said more than 400 foreign runners had signed up with his agency to compete in what has been billed as one of the most exotic marathon locales on Earth. He said it was his agency’s biggest group in 10 years and would have been one of the largest ever. Despite the travel ban, the event, which reportedly had slots for 500 tourists, will go ahead as planned with local runners. Mr Bonner’s company is also organising tours to a 10k run in Pyongyang in June and a half marathon in the Mount Paekdu area in August. Pyongyang's marathon held in conjunction with the birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the country's founder . The news comes amid reports North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has called for increased combat readiness . Another operator, Young Pioneer Tours, said on its website that it received the same notification, but it is expecting North Korea’s borders to reopen ‘very soon’. The decision comes just a few months after North Korea released a propaganda-influenced advert, set to an accordion group’s cover of A-ha’s 1984 hit Take On Me, to recruit foreign runners. Last year’s race was the first time foreign runners were allowed to compete in the event, known as the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, but they were monitored by officials and placed under restrictions. The 2014 half marathon was won by a Briton, Will Marks, who lives in Shanghai and was 30 when he claimed his victory with a time of one hour and 33 minutes. Spectators cheer on competitors during the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon in Pyongyang . Women in traditional outfits stand near the Pyongyang marathon finish line at Kim Il-sung Stadium . In an interview last year, he told MailOnline: 'It was as surreal as you'd imagine. After I finished we had to stand around in the heat for hours then parade around in the middle of the pitch with the anthems playing, then the North Korea minister for sports and some podium girls gave me the medal and a big daisy.' Runners were not allowed to carry their country’s flag, cameras or communication devices during the race, and they were barred from leaving their hotel to roam freely. Pyongyang's marathon is sanctioned as a bronze-level event by the International Association of Athletics Federations and has been held almost annually since 1981 in conjunction with the birthday of Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder and the grandfather of its current leader. North Korea has cancelled another popular tourist event, the Arirang Mass Games, without citing a reason. It involves thousands of gymnasts, dancers and schoolchildren who perform choreographed routines.","Travel agencies said they have been told the event is closed to tourists .

"Britain's spies tried to recruit an agent in North Korea who could provide top-secret information on its fledgling nuclear programme, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. MI6 wanted details about the dictatorship’s plans in a ‘long-term relationship in return for payment’. The sensitive revelation emerged from a cache of hundreds of secret documents that were leaked to media organisations and published last night. Asking for help: MI6 tried to recruit a North Korean agent, meeting the insider for two hours, this cable shows . The electronic files, handed to the Al Jazeera news agency, could cause embarrassment to Britain and other governments in the wake of the revelations two years ago by Edward Snowden. The latest disclosures are not on the same scale as those exposed in 2013 by the former CIA employee – who is currently in hiding in Russia – but they offer a tantalising glimpse into the shadowy world of espionage, focusing on human intelligence rather than digital intelligence. Spanning a period from 2006 until December 2014, the digital leak includes detailed briefings and internal analyses written by operatives of South Africa’s State Security Agency. They reveal the South Africans’ secret correspondence with US intelligence agency the CIA, Britain’s MI6, Israel’s Mossad, Russia’s FSB and Iran’s operatives. In one document, a cable marked ‘Secret UK/SA eyes only’ shows that MI6, formally referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service, requested assistance from South Africa’s intelligence chiefs to carry out ‘a joint operation’. Dictatorship: The secretive state of North Korea is ruled with an iron fist by leader Kim Jong Un . The aim was to recruit a spy inside the opaque North Korean decision-making system. An undated cable was sent from an MI6 operative to South Africa ‘requesting your support to assist our officer’. It said MI6 would intercept the North Korean while in transit between flights in South Africa ‘and encourage him to accept a long-term relationship with SIS’. Capability: The foundations of a nuclear power plant are laid in North Korea in August 2002 . It asked South Africa to ‘provide covert surveillance to identify [X] on his arrival … and securely house him whilst our officer makes contact.’ The British agency also requested the South Africans ensured the MI6 officer and the North Korean target were ‘not interrupted by any of his colleagues’. MI6 wrote: ‘The involvement of South Africa’s authorities would not be apparent to the target – our officer would appear to be acting alone.’ The secret cable also reveals that an MI6 officer had approached the target a year earlier, held a two-hour meeting with him and offered an undisclosed amount of money in exchange for ‘a long-term clandestine relationship’. The target had ‘stated that he would be happy to meet the officer again under secure circumstances,’ MI6 wrote. ‘But a year has passed without us hearing’ from him, the cable added. The British spies added that they regarded this as an ‘unusual opportunity, which, if successful, could greatly assist our ongoing efforts to gain coverage of North Korean proliferation activity’. The leaked documents do not disclose whether or not the South Africans agreed to provide the assistance requested by MI6 or if the plan was a success. Other documents revealed that: . The case of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, contradicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came after he made a theatrical 2012 speech to the United Nations. Netanyahu urged military action against Iran so it would 'dismantle its nuclear weapons programme altogether'. The Israeli Prime Minister even held up a cartoon bomb to show how close Iran was to being capable of a nuclear attack - adding it could happen in a matter of months. But just a month after his speech in September 2012, agents for the Israeli intelligence service Mossad admitted Iran was not preparing any nuclear weapons. Threat: A leaked report, apparently by Israeli spies, appears to contradict the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2012 speech warning Iran was close to a nuclear weapon - in which he held up a cartoon bomb . Quote: One line in the report said Iran was allocating its most heavily-enriched uranium to a research reactor . The leaked Mossad report said although there was a 'significant increase' in the amount of uranium Iran had enriched, the country did 'not appear ready' to enrich uranium at the highest rate. It said Iran had around 100kg of uranium enriched to 20 per cent purity. Although such uranium can be used to make a bomb, weapons more commonly use uranium at 90 per cent purity, according to the World Nuclear Association. The report said: 'The quantity of material enriched to 20 per cent is not increasing at this stage as some is being converted to nuclear fuel. Document: The report, pictured, is one of hundreds of cables obtained by Al Jazeera and the Guardian . Quote: The report featured a 'bottom line', which Israeli officials have argued did follow Netanyahu's warning . 'Even though Iran has accumulated enough 5 per cent enriched uranium for several bombs, and has enriched some of it to 20 per cent, it does not appear to be ready to enrich it to higher levels. 'It is allocating some of it to produce nuclear fuel for the TRR [Tehran Research Reactor], and the amount of 20 per cent enriched uranium is therefore not increasing. 'Bottom line: Though Iran at this stage is not performing the activity necessary to produce weapons, it is working to close gaps in areas that appear legitimate such as enrichment, reactors, which will reduce the time required to produce weapons from the time the instruction is actually given.' The report's disclosure has come at a critical time for relations between the U.S., Israel and Iran. Netanyahu is due to address the U.S. Congress next Tuesday, and many expect him to make another hardline stand about Iran's nuclear programme. In the meantime the U.S. is playing a leading role in the international bid to introduce more controls over Iran's nuclear programme, which led to 'constructive' talks today in Geneva, Switzerland. Iran insists it only uses nuclear technology for civilian power plants, not weapons. But in his 2012 speech to the UN, the Israeli Prime Minister referred casually to Iran's 'first bomb'. 'The relevant question is not when Iran will get the bomb,' he said. 'The relevant question is at what stage we can we no longer stop Iran from getting the bomb. The red line must be drawn.' Showing a cartoon bomb to the world representatives, he said: 'This is a bomb, this is a fuse. Innocent: Iran has insisted it is only enriching uranium for civilian purposes, not weapons, but the claim is disbelieved by Israel. Pictured: Then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tours an enrichment plant in 2008 . Caught in the middle: U.S. President Barack Obama (centre) must balance his firm alliance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) with negotiations with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (right) 'In the case of Iran's nuclear plans to build a bomb, this ""bomb"" has to be filled with enough enriched uranium and Iran has to go through three stages. 'Iran's completed the first stage. It took them many years but they completed it and they're 70 per cent of the way there. Now they're well into the second stage'. He added stage two would be complete by summer 2013 and said: 'From there it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks, before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb. 'What I've told you is not based on secret information. It's not based on military intelligence. It's based on the public reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency.' One senior Israeli government official hit back over the leaked reports - telling the Guardian that there was no contradiction between the report and the Prime Minister's 2012 speech. Both said that Iran was increasing the rate at which it was enriching uranium, the official said. Relationship: Netanyahu, pictured in the Oval Office with Obama in October, will address Congress next week . Another of the leaked cables claimed Barack Obama 'threatened' Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas over his bid to win formal statehood for Palestine. The memo, dated November 22, 2012, referenced 'a phone call made between Pres. OBAMA and Pres. ABBAS where Pres. OBAMA threatened Pres. ABBAS if he goes ahead with the UN bid.' It added Palestinian officials were 'adamant' about pushing through their bid to be recognised at the United Nations. One intelligence contact said his family - who lived in Gaza - said there was 'no place safe in the whole of Gaza. They are like trapped rats on a boat'. Another memo claimed a CIA agent had seemed to be 'desperate to make inroads into Hamas in Gaza' - which if true would breach a government ban on contact with the Islamist movement. Palestinian officials failed in their bid to be recognised in December when it was blocked by the UN Security Council. British MPs voted to support the bid, but the UK was only one of 15 countries on the Security Council, of which at least nine had to back Palestinian statehood for it to pass. The application won the support of eight members of the Security Council, falling short by just one. The U.S. - which has a right of veto on the influential body - also voted against the move.","MI6 had 2-hour meeting with North Korean 'target' and offered payment .

"British rugby league commentator Eddie Hemmings has come under fire for mistaking Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou for Samuel L. Jackson live on TV. Hemmings made the remark while commentating the World Club Challenge for Sky Sports on Sunday. The camera panned to show actor Russell Crowe who was watching his team, 2014 NRL Champions the South Sydney Rabbitohs, take on St. Helen's in England with long-time friend Hounsou. Scroll down for video . Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou (centre) at the Rabbitohs game with team owner and friend Russell Crowe (right) and Sam Burgess (left) British rugby league commentator Eddie Hemmings has come under fire for joking that Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou looked like Samuel L. Jackson . The camera panned to show actor Russell Crowe who was watching his team, 2014 NRL Champions the South Sydney Rabbitohs, take on St. Helen's in England with long-time friend Hounsou . Hemmings joked: 'Samuel L. Jackson alongside him, wasn't it? Looked like him. Maybe it was somebody doing an impersonation.' The comments drew sharp criticism from viewers, who took to Twitter to accuse Hemmings of 'casual racism' and make fun of him for confusing two black actors. 'Can't believe Eddie Hemmings trotted out the ""black guy looks like Samuel L Jackson"" line. I mean, come on,' @MatthewRiley81. 'Eddie Hemmings utterly embarrassing himself on national TV once again…claiming his comments were tongue in cheek makes it worse #Dinosaur,' @SupernovaPhil88 tweeted. But Hemmings hit back at his online detractors later in the game. Hemmings (pictured) was slammed on Twitter but he hit back at his online detractors, saying: 'Pity some people don't have things better to do on a Sunday night' Hemmings said he 'tongue-in-cheek' suggested Hounsou looked a little bit like Samuel L. Jackson (pictured) 'Off the field we do have of course Russell Crowe with his Hollywood friends,' he said. 'The gentleman there who I tongue-in-cheek suggested looked a little bit like Samuel L. Jackson but I can tell you it's the man who played Juba in Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning movie The Gladiator. 'His names' Djimon Hounsou, he's an actor model from America, a big pal of Russell's, came up here on the helicopter ride with him and apparently social media has lit up with certain comments this evening. 'Pity some people don't have things better to do on a Sunday night but anyway there you are that's the record cleaned up for you and I hope that you're enjoying every second of this match here.' Hounsou played Juba alongside Crowe in the Oscar-winning movie The Gladiator . But Twitter users continued to slam Hemmings, posting images of other famous black actors and musicians including Laurence Fishburne, Kerry Washington, Ice Cube and Chris Rock. Crowe decided to ditch the Oscars in favour of standing side by side with Sam Burgess to watch their team take on St. Helens in England for the World Club Challenge. The 50-year-old was all smiles prior to the game, and his spirits lifted even higher when the 2014 NRL Champions defeated St. Helens 39-0. Rusty wore his colours proud as he sported a green and red hooded letterman jacket to the game - which he traveled to via helicopter. He was seen rubbing shoulders with Sam Burgess, who was cheering his brothers Tom and George on from the sidelines. The actor and director seemed a bit concerned during some moments, but it wasn't long before the Rabbitohs took a dominating lead. The Rabbitohs, of which Rusty is a co-owner, became the sixth NRL winners of the World Club Challenge, which sees the NRL champions take on the European Super League champions, in the last seven years.

Conflict of interest? A television commercial for the Government’s Change4Life anti-obesity campaign . The disclosure will lead to renewed claims ministers are failing to address the crisis because they are too ‘cosy’ with the industry. It comes after a major report in the British Medical Journal found that key scientists advising ministers on obesity were receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds for research from the junk food industry, including the likes of Nestle and Mars. There has been particular suspicion over Change4Life’s schemes offering families money-saving vouchers for seemingly healthier products – which happen to be made by junk food firms. These include Smart Swaps and Sugar Swaps deals which give the public discounts on items such as Pepsi Max, Uncle Ben’s Rice Time ready meals – made by Mars – and certain ASDA products. A number of those involved in the voucher schemes also pay Freud Communications for their marketing, including Pepsico, Mars, ASDA and Warburtons. This has prompted further suspicion they are simply hijacking Change4Life as a free advertising ploy. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘There has to be a conflict of interest. It’s a cosy deal.’ Public Health England, the Government agency tasked with tackling obesity, would not say how much Freud is paid to market Change4Life. But accounts on its website show £2.73million was given to the firm in the past ten months, to promote Change4Life, as well as run campaigns on cancer awareness and smoking. The other arm of the Government’s obesity policy, the Responsibility Deal, has also been criticised for letting manufacturers set their own goals for making products healthier. Freud won the contract for Change4Life in 2012 and is solely responsible for its publicity. Sheila Mitchell of Public Health England said: ‘Agency groups of this high quality are always bound to have a mixed portfolio of clients.’ Freud would not comment.","Freud Communications paid £3million a year to run health campaigns .

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's aunt Tina Brown has been rushed by ambulance to the same hospital where her niece is in a coma, according to reports. Mrs Brown was overcome by the stress of Bobbi Kristina's condition, which has scarcely improved since she was found unconscious in her bathtub on January 31, according to RadarOnline. The pair were exceptionally close and Mrs Brown has been keeping vigil with other family members and praying for the 21-year-old’s recovery. In hospital: Brown, the sister of Bobby Brown, was socializing with other Brown family members when she fell ill, experiencing a numbness on the right side of her body triggering the call for an ambulance . Whitney Houston’s daughter remains in a coma as of Sunday. Ms Brown, who has suffered several heart attacks is understandably 'very stressed out' at the condition of her niece, according to Radar. Her representative told Radar that Mrs Brown was socializing with other Brown family members when she fell ill and began feeling numb on the right side of her body. Over the past few weeks the family has been visibly stressed. At one point, Mrs Brown was involved in an argument when she hit her son Shayne on the head with a glass, according to the web site. Close-knit: Tina Brown has been in Atlanta since soon after her niece was hospitalized on January 31 holding vigil with other family members and praying for the 21-year-old’s recovery . Meanwhile, Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital, her R&B-singer father claims. Gordon tweeted in anger this weekend, saying he had been denied access to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend in the hospital where she remains in a medically-induced coma three weeks after being pulled unconscious from a bathtub. 'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!' he tweeted Saturday. But Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown has refuted the claim that Gordon is desperately trying to visit his daughter. Not true: Bobby Brown says his daughter's boyfriend Nick Gordon  has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital, where she remains in a medically-induced coma. Brown pictured on the right at Emory Hospital on February 6, Gordon on the left outside the hospital when Bobbi Kristina was first hospitalized . Couple: Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in a bathtub three weeks ago, and has been in a coma ever since. Pictured with her boyfriend in 2012 . 'Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit,' the R&B star said in a statement through his lawyers. 'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe.' Gordon's lawyers responded to Brown's statement by saying they advised their client against agreeing to Brown's unspecified terms. In a statement released Sunday, Gordon's lawyers said Brown has 'consistently prohibited' Gordon from visiting Bobbi Kristina, who she 'would want by her side'. 'Mr. Brown has only ""offered an opportunity to potentially meet with Bobbi Kristina"" if Nick were to meet certain conditions, conditions that we, his attorneys, have advised him not to meet, particularly in light of Mr. Brown's inability to guarantee access. 'But in an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers. Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart,' the statements reads. Reports suggest Gordon may by the subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital. In his Saturday rant, Gordon also tweeted: 'If she hears MY voice let me massage her, play her favorite music I believe it will help. If you ask Bobby anything abt [sic] he cannot answer.' Plea: Gordon, who has been frozen out by the family for weeks, insisted his presence will help the 21-year-old . Demands: The extraordinary outburst also included a request to massage her once she heard his voice . Ink: He then posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo with his partner's name on, saying it was healing nicely . He posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo of Bobbi Kristina's name on his arm alongside the message: 'Healing fine just like my baby.' On Wednesday, Gordon’s lawyer Randall Kessler said his client ‘desperately wants to be with the one he loves.’ Gordon's efforts to see Bobbi Kristina have been blocked by the family claims Kessler, with relatives of Bobby Brown threatening to lay ‘hands on him’ if he shows up. Kessler said, ‘[Nick] has respected the family's wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation… He continues to hope that his request will be granted.' A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown (above) was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub . Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. He sent a defiant message to Bobby Brown and the Houston family just days ago when he had the ailing heiress's name tattooed across his arm in huge letters. A new report which surfaced on Saturday claims that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Sources say she used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother three years earlier . Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claim, and was 'distraught' still over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words.' She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital after being found by her possible husband Nick Gordon, and remains in critical condition. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Earlier this week she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. This as Gordon has reportedly become the main focus in a criminal investigation into what caused this incident. Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31. She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.","Tina Brown and Bobbie Kristina was close to her sister-in-law Whitney Houston and revealed their drug use in 2006 .

"Vladimir Putin and his top apparatchiks should face international justice over the annexation of Crimea, Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko demanded today. Vowing to win back the Black Sea peninsula in future, Poroshenko alleged the rights of people in the annexed region had been repressed under Kremlin control. His demands came as Kiev delayed a promised pullback of heavy weapons from the front line in eastern Ukraine, saying continuous attacks from rebel troops means they cannot safely withdraw.

Petro Poroshenko's demands came as Kiev delayed a promised pullback of heavy weapons from the front line in eastern Ukraine, saying continuous attacks from rebel troops means they cannot safely withdraw . Poroshenko used an address on the first anniversary of the start of the annexation to promise his country will regain control over the peninsula. 'I am not going to say today that it will happen quickly and easily,' admitted the pro-Western president. 'But it will definitely happen, we shall build together a new Crimea, where the rights and interests of the indigenous people of Crimea and all the inhabitants of the peninsula, regardless of their ethnic, language and religious background, will be guaranteed.' He went on to demand Putin faces international justice over the annexation of Crimea. 'The time will come, and anyone who has committed and will commit a crime against the Ukrainian state and human rights in Crimea, will face international and Ukrainian trials,' he said. He wants Russian officials to stand trial in The Hague, said the Kiev media. A member of the Ukrainian armed forces smokes as he stands near an armoured personnel carrier today . Members of the Ukrainian armed forces embrace after returning from the front line near Artemivsk . Ukrainian troops ride on armored vehicles towards Artemivsk in the east of the country this morning . Despite pro-Russian rebels making new inroads in eastern Ukraine in the past month, Poroshenko claimed his country 'will never give up its sovereign rights to Crimea.' 'Ukraine will defend by all available means the rights of people, who live there. There is a complete consensus on this issue,' said. The annexation - which began one year ago - was a 'vile act carried out contrary to international law', he said. With rebels massing near the strategic port of Mariupol, in violation of a ceasefire, Kiev refused to pull back its heavy weapons, claiming its forces were still be targeted by separatists. 'As Ukrainian positions are still being fired upon there can be no talk yet of a withdrawal of arms,' said military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov . Moscow denies giving military support to the rebels. But Russia made the same denials over Crimea before admitting that it had deployed troops. If Mariupol falls to the pro-Russian rebels, it would remove a key obstacle to creating a separatist land corridor stretching from Russia's border with Ukraine to Crimea.

A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a truck pulling a twin-barrelled anti-aircraft gun while his withdrawing unit rests in the village of Artemivsk, near Debaltseve, in the largely rebel-held Donetsk province . This morning military spokesman Lt. Col. Anatoliy Stelmakh told reporters that Ukraine will begin its delayed withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line in the east of the country only when rebel attacks entirely stop, in line with a cease-fire that was supposed to begin February 15. Stelmakh said there were two rebel artillery attacks overnight and although this is significantly fewer than in previous days, 'as long as firing on Ukrainian military positions continues, it's not possible to talk about a pullback.' Colonel Valentyn Fedichev, deputy commander of the military operation against the rebels, said there had been 27 attacks against Ukrainian forces over the past 24 hours, which he said was lower than in recent days. He also indicated that no pullback was imminent. 'If the enemies continue to use their own heavy weapons, it is clear that Ukraine will continue to counteract these operations,' he said.

Ukrainian troops ride  on an armored vehicles ahead of self-propelled artillery near Artemivsk this morning . Members of the Ukrainian armed forces ride military vehicles near Artemivsk earlier todau . The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission in Ukraine is supposed to be monitoring the weapons withdrawal. Its spokesman, Michael Bocuirkiw today said the monitors had seen heavy weapons movements by both sides but could not tell whether weapons were being pulled back or just being redeployed. An Associated Press reporter today saw Ukrainian forces moving back from around the town of Debaltseve, which was captured last week by rebel forces after a fierce week-long siege. Both Stelmakh and Fedichev said rebels are still trying to overrun a Ukrainian government position in the village of Shyrokyne, on the outskirts of the strategic port city of Mariupol. Rebels began moving toward Mariupol last August, raising concerns they were seeking to seize the city in order to establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula. Russia has denied arming the rebels, a denial scoffed at by Western nations and NATO, who point to satellite pictures of Russian weapons in Ukraine. German doctors have been allowed to visited Ukrainian military pilot Nadezhda Savchenko, who has been on hunger strike for more than two months in a Russian jail, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said today. Savchenko, 33, was captured by pro-Russian forces and handed over eight months ago to Russia, where she was imprisoned on charges of aiding the killing of two Russian journalists in east Ukraine. At home, she has become a symbol of resistance to Russian aggression. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow the humanitarian visit during talks on a ceasefire for eastern Ukraine in Minsk on Feb. 11-12, spokesman Martin Schaefer said. Ukrainian army pilot Nadia Savchenko holds a sign inside a cage as she attends a hearing at the Basmanny district court in Moscow charges with aiding the killing of two Russian journalists in east Ukraine last year . Two German doctors visited her on February 15, then held talks with her prison doctors, in which Savchenko was included. Savchenko is reported to have lost 37 lb since going on a water and glucose diet in December. Schaefer told a regular government news conference that Germany was extremely concerned about her health, and repeated an appeal for her release. He gave no further details of her condition, and said it was regrettable that reports had appeared in Russian media despite an agreement to maintain confidentiality. Russia's Investigative Committee says the pilot provided the coordinates of two Russian journalists who were killed by a mortar attack in June in the Luhansk region of east Ukraine, held by pro-Russian rebels. She denies the accusation, but could be jailed for up to 20 years if found guilty. Steinmeier is a member of the traditionally Russia-friendly Social Democrats and has long ties with Putin, although he has stuck closely to Chancellor Angela Merkel's tough line with Moscow over its backing of separatists in east Ukraine.","Petro Poroshenko says rights of Crimeans are being repressed by Russia .

"Australian of the Year Rosie Batty has sparked an outpouring of reactions on social media about domestic violence after she appeared on Monday night's Q&A program on the ABC. The panel program had a frank discussion on the issue, which included former politician Natasha Stott Despoja, Victoria Acting Police Commissioner Tim Cartwright, sports broadcaster Charlie King and family social worker Simon Santosha. Ms Batty provided a victim's point of view to the show and her experience struck a nerve with the audience and Twitter users. Australian of the Year Rosie Batty's frank discussion on ABC's Q&A on Monday night sparked an outpouring of emotions on Twitter . When asked by a viewer why women stay in abusive relationships, the family violence campaigner gave a heartbreaking response, which shed light on the emotions victims go through. 'When we say ""why doesn't she leave"", sometimes it's because that is the highest point of risk to be killed or injured and sometimes when you're in that type of relationship, all I can say is that you have a fear that you can't really explain, it's a dread... of what could happen next,' Ms Batty said. 'Quite often you stay in the situation you know because by taking out an AVO it's gonna piss him off, by taking him to court, making a statement to police it’s gonna piss him off. You don’t know what we’re going to exacerbate.' It seems Ms Batty's appearance on Q&A was an emotional one for many social media users who took to Twitter to thank her for speaking out. Ms Batty was named Australian of the Year last month after she became a voice for campaigning against family violence when her son, Luke (pictured abovewith her), was killed by her ex-husband . '#qanda is bringing up many emotions tonight. #leavingisthehardest #stillrecovering #strongwoman,' one woman wrote. While another said: 'Rosie Batty explained so much about the psychology of DV, and not wanting to leave an abusive situation on this evening. Opened my eyes.' Ms Batty told Daily Mail Australia she was grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the discussion. 'It was a wonderful opportunity on Q&A which is well respected program. It has never been done before [speaking about domestic violence] and it was long overdue. We [the panel] were please with the response we received from the audience,' she said. In the lead up to the program, there were criticisms about the number of men on the panel compared to women. But Ms Batty said what was important that the conversation about domestic violence was being discussed. 'It's important to have a variety of people talking,' she said. 'Resources are being cut back and it's really important to have a platform to remind people of the reality of how people are living.' Last month Ms Batty was named Australian of the Year for her work for campaigning againist family violence. Ms Batty became an influential figure after her ex-husband killed their son, Luke, during cricket practice in outer Melbourne in February 2014.","Rosie Batty appeared on Monday's Q&A on ABC to discuss family violence .

"More than 100 birds have been injured during testing of a new solar power farm. Biologists say 130 birds caught fire mid-air while entering an area of concentrated solar energy created by the 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project near Tonopah, Nevada. Experts believe the birds may have been attracted by the glow of the farm’s tower, but the project’s owners, SolarReserve, say they have found a way to reduce the fatalities. Biologists say 130 birds have caught fire in mid-air while entering an area of concentrated solar energy created by the 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project (pictured) near Tonopah, Nevada . The solar project is close to being completion and is set to go launch next month. Thousands of mirrors focus sunlight onto one central tower to melt salt inside it, which will in turn heat water so that steam will turn turbines to generate electricity. At its peak, the project will produce 110 megawatts of electricity, which will be sold to NV Energy – a firm that powers the majority of homes in Nevada, Rewire reported. In a test, one third of the project’s 10,000 mirrors were moved to focus sunlight at a point 1,200 feet above ground level – at approximately twice the height of its tower. It took biologists just an hour and a half to notice the first of the ‘streamers’ – birds that catch fire and leave a trail of smoke in the air -when entering the field of solar energy. Experts think the birds may have been attracted by glow of the farm’s tower, but the project’s owners, SolarReserve, say they have found a way to reduce the fatalities. A scorched bird found near another solar farm in California ia shown . At its peak, the project (marked on the map), based near Tonopah, will produce 110 megawatts of electricity, which will be sold to NV Energy – a firm that powers the majority of homes in Nevada . Some 130 birds were injured during the tests, which began on January 14, Rudy Evenson, deputy chief of communications for Nevada Bureau of Land Management in Reno, told Rewire. In a subsequent test, fewer mirrors were aimed at the focal point above the tower and this reduced the avian casualties. SolarReserve says it has now put mitigation measures in place. ‘Over the last 30 days of commissioning activities, which includes extended periods of flux [sunlight] on the tower, the Crescent Dunes project has only experienced a single (one) avian fatality attributed to the solar facility’ SolarReserve CEO Kevin Smith said. A spokeman told MailOnline: 'Once it was communicated to SolarReserve that there were avian safety issues, action was immediately taken to halt testing in order to evaluate the situation and prevent further issues. 'Our engineers worked diligently to successfully modify our testing methods and develop innovative mitigation procedures that have proven to resolve the identified avian safety issues. 'Importantly, we’re sharing the new safety methods with the solar tower industry so that changes can be made to protect wildlife and move forward with this revolutionary technology.' He said that the site was also carefully selected to have the minimal effect on wildlife, 'with avian safety one of out top priorities'. 'This careful site selection resulted in zero desert tortoises on site and no current identified wildlife issues.' A report last year found that tens of thousands of birds flying over California are being scorched to death each year by powerful sun beams from the world's largest solar plant – the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System. Some 130 birds were injured during the tests, which began on January 14, Rudy Evenson, deputy chief of communications for Nevada Bureau of Land Management said. They are known as streamers because of the smoke trails people can see as they fly. This 'streamer' was found at Ivanpah solar plant in California . The $2.2 billion (£1.32 billion) Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System launched last February at Ivanpah Dry Lake near the California-Nevada border. More than . 300,000 mirrors, each the size of a garage door, reflect solar rays onto . three boiler towers each looming up to 40 stories high. The water . inside is heated to produce steam, which turns turbines that generate . enough electricity for 140,000 homes. Sun rays sent up by the field of mirrors are bright enough to dazzle pilots flying in and out of Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Federal wildlife officials . said Ivanpah might act as a 'mega-trap' for wildlife, with the bright . light of the plant attracting insects, which in turn attract . insect-eating birds that fly to their death in the intensely focused . light rays. Federal and . state biologists call the number of deaths significant, based on . sightings of birds getting singed and falling, and on retrieval of . carcasses with feathers charred too severely for flight. Ivanpah . officials dispute the source of the so-called streamers, saying at . least some of the puffs of smoke mark insects and bits of airborne rubbish being ignited by the solar rays. Estimates per year range from a low of about a thousand by BrightSource Energy - the operator of a solar farm in the Mojave Desert - to 28,000 by an expert for the Centre for Biological Diversity environmental group. 'The deaths are alarming. It's hard to say whether that's the location or the technology,' said Garry George, renewable-energy director for the California chapter of the Audubon Society. 'There needs to be some caution.' The plant has been monitoring the number of bird carcasses found on its grounds during periodic studies, but there are fears that because the solar farms appear to be capable of vapourising birds as large as ravens in mid-air, the full extent of the problem may not come to light in the surveys. Mr George believes that authorities should track birds on during annual migratory seasons, before opening any more solar projects. Solar farms have been also been criticised for their impacts on desert tortoises. Last summer, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials warned California that the power-tower style of solar technology holds 'the highest lethality potential' of the many solar projects burgeoning in the deserts of California. The $2.2 billion Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (pictured) part-owned by Googlle has been blamed for killing birds, which experts say are being scorched by its mighty mirrors .","Around 130 birds have been injured near Tonopah, Nevada .

"New research has found than more 300,000 Australians are living with a chlamydia but more than three quarters of them have no idea that they are infected. It's a staggering figure considering the infection can be prevented for less than $10 and cured with one pill. ‘It’s the common cold of the genitals,’ Dr Jane Hocking from the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia. Chlamydia is most highly reported condition amongst Australians; more prevalent than any cancer or even influenza. Five per cent of young adults will have chlamydia. In Australia, there is a one in 20 chance of any person having sex with someone with chlamydia . Yet many more cases go unreported according to new data, which indicates that thousands of people unknowingly live with and subsequently spread the infection. This has led professionals to regard the disease as ‘the silent epidemic’. ‘Five per cent of young adults will have chlamydia. There is a one in 20 chance of having sex with someone with chlamydia,’ said Dr Hocking, who recently worked on a research paper into chlamydia with the UNSW Kirby Institute. ’80 per cent of the time people with chlamydia have no symptoms. 'The means 80 per cent of all infected people possibly have no idea they have it and will keep transmitting it,’ said Dr Hocking. The Kirby Insitute's new research has found that around 356,000 Australians were infected with chlamydia in 2013, but only 8000 are diagnosed every year. 'For every case that’s diagnosed four to five cases are undiagnosed,’ said David Wilson, who also contributed to the Kirby Institute's data collection. The Kirby Insitute's new research has found that around 356,000 Australians were infected with chlamydia in 2013, but only 8000 are diagnosed every year . It is crucial for misconceptions about the STI to be clarified so more people have the confidence to get tested. ‘Having chlamydia doesn't mean you’re having a lot of sex or sex with a lot of different partners,' Dr Hocking emphasised. ‘It’s very easy to catch.’ However, a startling result from the research found transmission occurs most commonly for young teens between the ages of 15 and 17. The prevalence of chlamydia amongst high school students has led health professionals to suggest the introduction of condom vending machines in high schools. ‘We do need to look at ways to increase condom accessibility, particularly amongst adolescents,’ said Dr Hocking. ‘Studies have shown that condom use and awareness has increased compared to a decade ago, but to get a young person to use a condom every time they have sex – I think you’ll never achieve that.’ The reasons why people are not tested are varied, but a lot of it has to do with embarrassment and a lack of education. 'People don't get tested or ask questions because of a combination of embarrassment, lack of confidence and lack of knowledge. Also, some people are just not thinking too hard about it at all!' said Dr Hocking. The prevalence of chlamydia amongst high school students has led health professionals to suggest the introduction of condom vending machines in high schools . Although chlamydia is not life-threatening it can have devastating consequences. Many young women do not realise they are suffering from the infliction until years later when they try to conceive, at which case the damage is irreparable. The average Australian woman will be 30 when she first tries to have a baby, meaning a woman can live for more than a decade without treating their STI as their reproductive organs progressively become more damaged. ‘Chlamydia will mainly become an issue for women. If the infection goes untreated, 10 per cent of cases are likely to develop pelvic inflammatory disease which can lead to infertility,’ said Dr Hocking. It is critical that men do not disregard chlamydia as being 'a woman's issue'. ‘However, the burden needs to be shared by both. Blokes need to be treated so they don’t continue to transmit it. ‘It’s a pity that women are the ones that carry the burden of extra health consequences.’ A large part of the problem is that young people focus on preventing pregnancies so will use a contraceptive, but do not give much thought to sexual health so do not prioritise using a condom . A large part of the problem is that young people focus on preventing pregnancies so will use a contraceptive, but do not give much thought to sexual health so do not prioritise using a condom. ‘Young girls will often go to a doctor and chat about contraception, but for young people in general STIs are not on their radar.’ This problem may be a result of Australians as a natural being particularly prudish when it comes to talking about 'the birds and the bees'. ‘It would take a major cultural change in Australia to change the problem, it will not be a solution overnight,’ said Wilson. ‘In the Netherlands, people are much more open about the issue of sex. Children will talk about their sexual life with their parents.’ This problem may be a result of Australians as a natural being particularly prudish when it comes to talking about 'the birds and the bees' ‘The Netherlands have a much lower rate of unplanned pregnancies and STIs because they have a more open approach to sex ed and the discussion is a normalised part of society,’ agreed Dr Hocking. It is becoming a more pressing issue to raise awareness of the importance of safe sex as casual dating apps become increasingly popular in Australia. ‘It will be interesting to see if STIs increase with the introduction of apps like Tinder and Grindr, which make hooking up so much easier,’ said Dr Hocking. The disease is just as easy to treat as it is to prevent. ‘It’s just a single dose of antibiotics! That’s it.’ It is becoming a more pressing issue to raise awareness of the importance of safe sex as hook up apps like Tinder and Grindr become increasingly popular in Australia .","356,000 Australians are estimated to currently have chlamydia in Australia .

"Battle: Rosie Dutton, 30, is demanding her daughter Olivia is allowed into reception class after she chose to exercise her right to hold her back a year because she would have started just after turning four . A mother is fighting for her daughter to be allowed into reception class at school a year later after she decided to delay her education because she only turned four a few weeks before school started. Olivia Dutton, from Staffordshire, was due to start primary school last September, weeks after her fourth birthday, but her parents decided to exercise their right to delay the start of her school life by 12 months. Her mother Rosie, 30, believes her daughter was 'not ready for school', and is furious her local council is now considering sending her straight into Year 1 because she was held back. Now she is fighting to allow Olivia to start in the reception class. If Mrs Dutton is successful it could help thousands of others start reception a year later too. Department for Education guidance brought in last year says summer-born children can wait until the September after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop. And it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be 'no barrier' to the child then starting in reception class. The rule was introduced after research showed they were more likely to struggle at school, do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university. But some councils are still sending youngsters straight into Year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were 'exceptional' circumstances. This means the child has only six years of education instead of seven before moving to secondary school, wiping out much of the intended benefit. Mrs Dutton said: 'I felt Olivia was not emotionally ready to start school just weeks after turning four. She's quite sensitive and takes a long time to get used to people. 'She was still finding it difficult to adjust to pre-school and I knew she wouldn't cope with the full-time hours of school - she often still needed a nap in the day. 'When I looked into it I discovered legally she didn't need to start school until this September. Row: Mrs Hutton says she would 'have no choice but to quit work and home school' Olivia if she automatically put into Year 1, robbing her of a year of education . 'But now I'm being told that she will probably have to start school at the same level as those in her chronological age - so she would skip straight to Year 1. 'It means she will miss out on an entire academic year, which makes no sense. She will start already a year behind her peers, it will mean she is destined for a school career which will see her struggling and playing catch-up - exactly the situation we were trying to avoid in the first place. Department for Education guidance allows parents to delay their child's schooling until the September after their fifth birthday. This policy, updated last apring, is designed to help children with birthdays between April 1 and August 31. This is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four. The Department for Education guidance says: ‘An increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school. 'There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class'. But some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into Year 1 to ease pressure on places in reception. Bracknell Forest Council says: ‘If you choose for your child not to start until their statutory school age... starting in a Reception class following a child’s fifth birthday is only possible in exceptional circumstances.’ Reading Borough Council warns: ‘You will need to apply for a place in Year 1. ‘However, the school may then be full because the places have been allocated to children in the previous school year.’ 'We have been asked for evidence of special educational or psychological needs, but she doesn't have any. 'There is no way I will let her start in Year 1, I will have no choice but to quit work and home school her.' There is growing evidence that children born late in the academic year who start school at four are already at a disadvantage just 12 months later. A 2009 Department for Education report found that only 40 per cent of children born in summer were achieving a good level of development compared with 50 per cent among those born in Spring and 64 per cent in Autumn babies. Those born in September were also almost twice as likely to achieve good grades as those in August. Of the lowest 20 per cent of achievers, 49 per cent were born in Summer months. Last spring ministers sent guidance to schools and councils that could end the anguish of parents whose children are forced to start formal education at barely four. The Department for Education guidance says: ‘In recent months, an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school.’ The advice, drawn up with help from parents, adds: ‘There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class.’ Campaign group Flexible School Admissions for Summer Born Children is lobbying ministers for clearer legislation, claiming many councils are not complying with the guidance. Campaign leader Pauline Hull said she had received a 'flurry' of complaints from parents who want to delay their children starting school but have claimed they are being forced to apply for a school - or they would forfeit a place in reception all together. The news comes as the debate surrounding the legal age children should start school is set to go before the Government's Education Committee next month. A spokesman for Staffordshire County Council said the decision about Olivia's future will now be decided by the school. Coun Ben Adams, cabinet member for learning, added: 'We are working with the school and Olivia's mum in order to get the best outcome for her and any admissions decision will take into account the latest DfE guidance plus information provided by Mrs Dutton in support of her application.' Summer-born babies tend to perform worse in exams and are more likely get bullied by their classmates, research has found. Many experts believe that the attainment gap between children born just after the academic year starts in September and those born during the summer holidays is already evident by the age of five and, while it narrows as pupils progress, it fails to close. A 2009 Department for Education report found that only 40 per cent of children born in summer were achieving a good level of development compared with 50 per cent among those born in Spring and 64 per cent in Autumn babies. Those born in September were also almost twice as likely to achieve good grades as those in August. Of the lowest 20 per cent of achievers, 49 per cent were born in Summer months. Previous Government research has said that at GCSE level, 10,000 teenagers fail to score five good grades every year simply because they are the youngest in the academic year. This compares to 90,000 for autumn-born pupils. In 2009 only 47 per cent of pupils born in August obtained five or more GCSES at A-C level compared with 55 per cent of those born in September. Another study carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found 12.5% of August-born pupils were assessed as having mild special educational needs by age 11, compared with only 7.1% of those born in September. Experts have argued over whether they should start school as soon as possible, with their September-born peers, wait several months or even be held back a year. Department for Education figures show 62 per cent of those born between May and August fail to meet minimum expected levels in areas such as reading, writing, speaking, maths and listening.","Olivia Dutton  only turned 4 a few weeks before the start of the school year .

"A software developer has created a workaround that lets an iPhone owner see notifications on their Android watch (pictured) A major criticism of smartwatches is that the majority only work with specific brands and models of phone. And even those that can be used across multiple devices are limited to specific operating systems. But now, a software developer has created a workaround that lets an iPhone owner see notifications on their Android watch. A video by Jerusalem-based Mohammad Abu-Garbeyyeh shows an iPhone running iOS 8 being paired with a Moto 360 watch running Android Wear. To create the hack, Mr Abu-Garbeyyeh used an iOS feature called Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS). In its developer library, Apple explained: ‘The purpose of the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) is to give Bluetooth accessories  a simple and convenient way to access many kinds of notifications that are generated on iOS devices. ‘The ANCS is designed around three principles: simplicity, efficiency and scalability. ‘As a result, accessories ranging from simple LEDs to powerful ‘companion’ devices with large displays can find the service useful.’ It is used by the Pebble smartwatch, as an example, to pair and show notifications on iPhones and iPads. In the short clip, a notification appears on Mr Abu-Garbeyyeh's iPhone, the Message app icon ‘jumps’ and then the notification appears on the watch shortly after.

"The Swedish government has been forced shut down an assimilation guide service after discovering that several aides may have been trying to recruit newly arrived immigrants to ISIS. The assimilation guides, a service provided by the Swedish state job agency, have been accused of taking bribes from migrant job-seekers and making 'recruitment attempts to militant fighting groups'. The state job agency, Arbetsformedlingen, has fired the entire network of assimilation guides with immediate effect following the reports. ISIS draft: Guides hired by the Swedish government to help integrate newly arrived immigrants may have made several 'recruitment attempts to militant fighting groups' 'We have received indication that there have been instances of recruitment attempts or contact-making situations related to various militant fighting groups,' Arbetsformedlingen's general director Mikael Sjöberg told Expressen. A spokesman for the state job agency said Saturday that the alleged recruitment drive might be linked to the Islamic State . The 'immigrant assimilation guides' were introduced four years ago to aid newly arrived job-seekers and help them integrate into Swedish society by providing a link to their old culture. The guides have been working for private companies which, in turn, have been hired by the state-run job agency. The state job agency's director Mikael Sjöberg has shut down the program with immediate effetct . Around 32,000 job-seekers currently have a coach assigned under the scheme. The decision to shut down the program has been made following a noticeable increase in complains from job-seekers, and several indications of criminal activity, including bribes, fraud, blackmail, threats and possible recruitment activity. 'It's to do with loans or gifts, like tablets, mobile phones and sometimes cash, in order to get connected to a specific assistant,' Mr Sjöberg said. He added that the Minister of State for Employment, Ylva Johansson, and government representatives have been informed. The Swedish intelligence service, Säpo, has confirmed that they have been contacted by the state job agency, but have yet to launch an investigation. 'This is not a common way of recruiting for travels that proclaim violence,' Säpo spokesperson Sirpa Franzén told Svenska Dagbladet. 'What we have seen in the past is that recruitment takes place in social situations and via social media.' Just last month, Säpo confirmed that at least one hundred Swedes have travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State.","Swedish state job agency fire all migrant jobseekers guides .

"Staring intently into the camera, a polar bear appears to be lost in thought while relaxing in the snow. The giant animal, pictured in Wapusk National Park, located in northern Manitoba, Canada, looks like he has plenty to think about as he rests his chin on his paws. These stunning images were taken by 39-year-old professional photographer Alberto Ghizzi Panizza, while on a seven day trip to the remote nature reserve.

At times Mr Ghizzi Panizza, of Parma, Italy, was just three metres away from the polar bears. He said: 'Polar bears are extremely dangerous and can be aggressive, so I had to be very careful when I approached them. 'Two bears approached us at one point and we had to make a quick exit from the area. It's quite scary, but I put the fear behind me and just continued taking the photographs afterwards.'

"Emma Watson has denied claims that she is secretly dating Prince Harry after a magazine reported the fourth-in-line to the throne was 'smitten'. The Harry Potter star put an end to the rumours with a tweet saying: 'World. Remember that little talk we had about not believing everything written in the media?!' Australian magazine Woman's Day sent the internet rumour mill into overdrive last week after claiming the royal sent Miss Watson an email to invite her out when she split from her boyfriend. But the UN Women Goodwill Ambassador set the record straight and tweeted saying: 'Also..... marrying a Prince not a prerequisite for being a Princess.' Harry Potter star Emma Watson (right) has denied claims that she is secretly dating Prince Harry . She also posted a link to Alfonso Cuarón's 1995 film A Little Princess which includes the  line: 'I am a princess. All girls are.' Her tweets were instantly acknowledged by her legions of loyal fans with the first post attracting 29,762 retweets. Katie Tray tweeted: 'Am I the only person who is relieved to know that @EmWatson is not dating Prince Harry? Tbh, she's too fierce for him. She can do way better.' Sammy Ammons tweeted: 'Emma Watson, very true. however, to someone out there, you will be a Queen.' The fourth in line to the throne, pictured arriving at a film premiere earlier this month, was said to have asked Miss Watson on a date . Miss Watson met Prince William last year during a dinner to celebrate the work of the Royal Marsden . Actor Zach Braff said: 'I am the one dating Prince Harry. Privacy please. Blessed and humble.' The Australian magazine claimed that the pair were having 'secret dates' with each other and were 'getting to know each other quite well'. According to Woman's Day, Harry, 30, asked the Harry Potter star out after hearing she had broken up with previous boyfriend Matthew Janney in December last year. Miss Watson was said to have met with the prince with a group of 12 friends and seen him in secret since. The 'insider' apparently told the magazine: 'Harry didn't want her to feel like she was put on the spot,' explains one insider. 'A party also shows he's fun and not stuffy.' 'He's smitten – and it's more than Emma's looks.' Prince Harry's last girlfriend was Cressida Bonas, with the pair splitting up 'amicably' last April . Prince Harry's first serious relationship was with Chelsy Davy, who he dated on-off for about six years . The rumour was met with a predictable flood of Harry Potter jokes. One tweet said: 'Emma Watson is dating Prince Harry! Despite JK Rowling's best efforts, Hermione is finally hooking up with Harry!' Another said: 'I hope Prince Harry and Emma Watson last because if they have a son, it will be the half-blood prince.' Prince Harry broke up with Cressida Bonas in April last year after a two-year on-off relationship ended amicably. The Prince was introduced to her by Princess Eugenie in 2012, with the couple's last public outing together coming at an England rugby match a month before they split. Before that, Harry dated Chelsy Davy, but the pair broke up in 2010 after a turbulent six-year relationship. After suggestions that the pair were set to get back together emerged in 2011, Prince Harry said her was '100 per cent single'. Despite this, Miss Davy was invited to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April that year. Miss Watson - who played Hermione in the Harry Potter series - broke up with Oxford University rugby player Matthew Janney in December. The couple, who dated for a year, went their separate ways due to Emma's unrelenting work schedule but said they were determined to remain friends. Break-up: Emma Watson split from Oxford University rugby player Matthew Janney in December . Miss Watson dated Will Adamowicz for two years and was pictured embracing him at Coachella Music festival in 2012 .

Miss Watson, who is now a UN Goodwill Ambassador, met Mr Adamowicz in his first year at Oxford, where she studied for a year as a visiting student. While the couple did their best to stay out of the public eye, they were seen embracing at Coachella music festival in 2012 and he joined her at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards.

"Roman Polanski (pictured) has asked for media to be banned from court during an extradition hearing over his 1977 conviction for having sex with a girl . Roman Polanski’s lawyer wants the media banned from court when it considers a US extradition request over the director’s 1977 conviction for having sex with an underage girl. The 81-year-old, who was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl, will attend the hearing on Wednesday in his childhood city of Krakow, Poland. His lawyer, Jan Olszewski, has asked the judge to ban media from the court in order to protect Polanski’s privacy and due to the circumstances of the case. The Oscar-winning director, who is in the country preparing to make a movie about French Jew Alfred Dreyfus, is subject to an Interpol warrant in effect in 188 countries, though he is able to move freely between France, Poland and Switzerland. Krakow prosecutors refused a request from US justice authorities last year to arrest Polanski but said there were no legal obstacles to the extradition, and have asked the court for a ruling. Polanski, director of classics like ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ and ‘Chinatown,’ pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los Angeles. He served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain in 1977 before he fled the United States on the eve of his sentencing the following year. In 2009, he was arrested in Zurich on a US warrant and placed under house arrest but was freed the following year after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him. In 2013, Mrs Geimer described in graphic detail for the first time what happened on the day of the attack in Jack Nicholson’s LA home. In her book, ‘The Girl,’ she wrote about how Polanski told her mother he wanted to take pictures of the teen for French Vogue but would not allow her to accompany her daughter. Describing the sexual assault, Mrs Geimer revealed that Polanski first plied her with champagne, taking pictures of her in the Jacuzzi in just her knickers before giving her a sleeping pill. During the screening of a documentary of his life at the Zurich Film Festival in 2011, Polanski said Mrs Geimer was a ‘double victim’ after she was caught up in the media glare of his arrest in 2009. The 81-year-old will attend the hearing on Wednesday in Krakow, Poland.

"A TV commercial showing a seven-year-old blind girl's imaginary Land of Oz has taken the Internet by storm after being aired during the Oscars, with many users deeming it 'beautiful' and 'moving'. The advert, created by Comcast to promote its new 'talking guide', details how Emily, a creative little girl from Iowa, sees the scenes and characters from the 1939 film, The Wizard Of Oz , in her mind. Narrating over a clip depicting an emerald-colored city and tornado, Emily, who is completely blind, says: 'I think about the shape, I think about color, and I also think about sound.

"Honda has announced  its new . chief executive following the air bag fiasco which killed five people and injured dozens more across the world. The car maker is still battling the fallout from a slew of recalls . that have shaken its reputation for quality. In December Honda expanded a recall of potentially lethal driver's side airbags to all 50 U.S. states. Newly appointed President Takahiro Hachigo (pictured right) shakes hands with outgoing Takanobu Ito. Honda named the engineer as its new chief executive following the air bag fiasco which killed five people . The air bags, which are made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp., can explode with too much force under certain conditions, sending deadly metal shrapnel into the passenger compartment. The defect has has so far been linked to at least five deaths in the U.S. and many more injuries. The unexpected appointment follows massive recalls by Honda of vehicles equipped with Takata air bags, which are used by many car makers - but Honda was the worst affected. Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando, Florida, was among those fatally wounded. She died in October after a minor crash in her 2001 Honda Accord caused the airbag to deploy. Police initially thought she had been the victim of a stabbing because of the severe nature of her injuries, according to her family's lawsuit. A lawsuit alleges that Hien Thi Tran (pictured) was struck by plastic and metal shrapnel after a Takata airbag deployed in her 2001 Honda Accord during a minor accident, fatally inuring her . A metal component of the airbag that critically injured Ms Tran - police initially thought she had been stabbed . But an autopsy revealed metal and plastic fragments from an exploding airbag caused her death. One incident from 2010 didn't involve a crash at all. Instead, a lawsuit claims that Kristy Williams was stopped at a red light in her 2001 Honda Civic when the airbag deployed. Metal fragments sliced into her neck, hitting her carotid artery - Williams was only able to survive by placing two fingers into the wound to limit the bleeding. Afterwards, the lawsuit alleges, she suffered strokes and was left with traumatic brain injury. New boss Takahiro Hachigo, 55, joined Honda in 1982 and has worked . across research and development, procurement and manufacturing, . with spells in the United States, Britain and China, where he is . currently a senior official at the R&D arm. He will replace Takanobu Ito, who is stepping down after six . years in the post during a period which saw Honda struggle through the global . financial crisis, natural disasters and the recent damaging . recalls. Ito and other executives took a pay cut in October following . a fifth recall in a year of the re-engineered Fit hybrid . subcompact. Honda's newly appointed President Takahiro Hachigo speaks during a press conference today in Tokyo . At a brief news conference in Tokyo, Ito and Hachigo spoke . little of Honda's recent missteps, instead saying the groundwork . had been laid to take the automaker forward after moves to make . its six operational regions self-reliant and accountable. Hachigo, who worked on the popular U.S. Odyssey minivan and . CR-V crossover, skips several ranks in his promotion to CEO, but . Ito said his broad experience made him the ideal candidate. 'I . felt this was the right timing for us to boost efficiency and . results globally,' Ito, 61, told reporters. Hachigo's appointment marks the first time Honda has named . as CEO a non-director and someone who has not headed the firm's . R&D company. 'My job is to take the (current) strategy forward, . and evolve it,' Hachigo said. Ito will remain on the board and become an adviser to Honda. U.S. and Japanese authorities have been investigating the Takata air bags. The U.S. fined Honda $70 million, which was the largest civil penalty levied against an automaker, for not reporting to U.S. regulators some 1,729 complaints that its vehicles caused deaths and injuries, and for not reporting warranty claims. The recalls have clouded the reputation of Honda and other Japanese automakers for quality and safety. They also raised costs for Honda, especially in North America, prompting the company to trim its annual earnings forecast after profit in the October-December quarter slipped 15 percent.","Honda have named new chief executive following recent air bag fiasco .

"Wolf Hall star Mark Rylance claims he has to edit Shakespeare plays to remove 'antisemitic' lines. The British actor and former artistic director at the Globe Theatre in London said he feels compelled to cut certain parts which have taken on more 'resonance' since the Holocaust. Rylance, who plays Thomas Cromwell in the hit BBC drama, was speaking at the Globe where he unveiled a copy of Shakespeare's first folio -  recently found in France. Wolf Hall star Mark Rylance claims he has to edit Shakespeare plays to remove 'antisemitic' lines. He was speaking at the Globe Theatre where he unveiled a copy of Shakespeare's first folio (above), . He said: 'I don't think there's pressure (to remove) the bawdy jokes. He's bawdier a lot more times than people realise. 'The pressures I feel are more for times where he will say something very antisemitic. 'I have to make the decision, do I include that or not. There are some very unfortunate antisemitic things that characters say. 'If a character says it, it doesn't mean the author means it but since the holocaust... these statements have a lot more resonance now than they did at that time.' The actor, who plays Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall, (L) said there are 'some very unfortunate antisemitic things that characters say' in Shakespeare's plays . Rylance, 55, added: 'Mostly you edit the plays because they're too long and boring. I think they were edited at the time. 'From what I know of talking to scholars, our own practices are not different from what they did at the time. 'If you went out and played in a puritan town in the north of England, you took out some of the things that were going to offend those people.' He said actors would be 'chased out of town' if they did not censor their own plays. 'Players have always adjusted the words to get on with the powers that be,' he added. Professor John Jowett of The Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham said: 'Anti-Semitism is a fact of the early modern culture in which Shakespeare lived, worked, and thought, and he was not exempt from it. 'Critics have often remarked on his sensitive and to some extent sympathetic presentation of Shylock, but there is always an element of special pleading. Many point towards Shakespeare's character of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice as a symbol of the antisemitic feeling present in Elizabethan England at the time. Shylock is a Jewish moneylender who grants a loan to his Christian rival Antonio. When Antonio defaults on the loan, Shylock demands a pound of flesh as payment - as was previously agreed. One interpretation of the play is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the vengeful Shylock, who lacks the religious grace to show mercy. Similarly, some highlight  Shylock's forced conversion to Christianity as Shakespeare intending a 'happy ending' for the character - redeeming him from his unbelief and his specific sin of wanting to kill Antonio. However critics also remark on the sensitive and sympathetic presentation of the Jewish character. 'Mark Rylance is absolutely right to note the sharply anti-Semitic 'resonance' that some of the lines Shakespeare gives his characters have today. 'Directors face difficult decisions in this respect. They should be free to act without fear, irrespective of whether their decision is to play the text fully or soften its edges to avoid giving offence. 'It's useful when they tell the public what they've done, and so I welcome Rylance's openness.' Mark Rylance was artistic director at the Globe Theatre for ten years from 1995 to 2005, directing and acting in notable productions of Twelfth Night and Richard II. He spoke today at the unveiling of The Saint Omer folio. The folio was found in November in a library in the French town of Saint Omer - where it had lain undiscovered for nearly 200 years. The value of the folio is estimated at £3 million to £6 million, according to Remy Cordonnier, who uncovered it in the library in Saint Omer. It will be exhibited at the Globe in 2016, the year of the 400th anniversary Shakespeare's death. There are only around 230 copies of the folio in existence, experts say. During today's interview, Rylance, who has won three Tony awards for his roles in Shakespeare plays, added that he was 'not a big fan' of making young people read the. He said: 'I'm not a big fan of young people being forced to read Shakespeare. 'His chosen art form was theatre. It's not a thing that relies on whether you can read or not. 'The plays were written to be heard and I think taking young people to read them and then answer tests about them is really disrespectful to the author. Discovery: The value of the folio is estimated at £3 million to £6 million, according to Remy Cordonnier, who uncovered it in the library in Saint Omer . 'If you like reading them, great. I prefer to hear them and have them acted out. I can't understand them apart from when I read them, until I get up and play them, or hear some good actors playing them because they are expressions of emotions and feelings. 'If you read them drily, unless you imagine that stuff, or are good at imagining that stuff, they cannot make sense . 'But when you hear them and see them acted out in front of you or you act them out yourself, which is what I did as a child, then you really get into the value of them. 'So I'm a little bit sceptical about young people being forced to read them. If they want to, great, but I think that's the last thing the author intended.'","British actor speaking at Globe - where he was artistic director for 10 years .

"A magistrate who has handed down many tough sentences over the past decade for reckless driving and speeding has now lost his licence for doing the same thing. Magistrate Ronald Saines, from Geelong in Victoria, was clocked doing 25km/h over the speed limit last November while apparently trying to overtake five cars. Unfortunately for Saines, one of these cars was an unmarked police vehicle. The senior magistrate - who is known for berating dangerous drivers who have appeared before him - had his licence immediately suspended for 28 days, the Herald Sun reported. Magistrate Ronald Saines (not pictured), from Geelong in Victoria, was clocked doing 25km/h over the speed limit last November while apparently trying to overtake five cars including an unmarked police vehicle . A source told the newspaper Mr Saines was attempting to overtake a number of cars on the highway when he was stopped by police who issue him an infringement notice for driving between 25km/h and 34km/h over the limit. Mr Saines had to report to Chief Magistrate Peter Lauritsen following the incident, who said in a statement his actions didn't change his ability as a magistrate. 'I have discussed the circumstances surrounding the suspension of his licence.' he told the Herald Sun. 'I am satisfied he has performed, and will continue to perform, his duties as a magistrate properly.' It was reported that Mr Saines enlisted the services of a court employee to help him get to work during his suspension period - which was carried out in December. Mr Saines has lost his licence but will continue to perform his duties as a magistrate . Since 2002, when Mr Saines became a magistrate, he has been known for his delivery severe messages to those in similar situations to the one he found himself in. To one offender caught travelling at 139km/h in a 110km/h zone, he said: 'When you eventually do get your licence back, you will have to start over with a completely different attitude to driving.' To another who had had their licence 'less than 12 months' he warned how close to losing control or causing a serious accident they had been. However Mr Saines is said to have let off a man travelling at least 35km/h over the speed limit off in 2006, after he ruled that speedometer could have been faulty. Mr Saines has also sat in on the judgment of Geelong footballer Mathew Stokes, who fronted court on drug charges in 2010.","Magistrate Ronald Saines was clocked doing 25km/h over the speed limit .

"Rosamund Pike, Felicity Jones and Julianne Moore dazzled on the red carpet at Sunday night's star-studded Oscar awards. But you can be sure that their cashmere complexions, perfect rouge pouts and subtle smokey eyes weren't the result of a quick beautifying session in the back of their cabs on the way there. As celebrity make-up artist Aimee Adams - who has painted the famous faces of everyone from Helen Mirren to Sienna Miller via Michael Fassbender - explains, getting ready for the Oscars is a complex and time-consuming process. FEMAIL were keen to learn exactly how the stars get red carpet ready, so we called on Aimee to talk us through how she beautifies the  stars for Tinseltown's glittering awards ceremonies. Celebrity make-up artist Aimee Adams - who has painted the famous faces of everyone from Helen Mirren to Sienna Miller via Michael Fassbender - explained to FEMAIL what a complex process getting ready for the Oscars is. She tested out her tips and tricks on Deborah Ann Gaetano, 37, of Buckinghamshire, pictured, left, before, and, right, after having an A-list worthy make-over . She then recreated celebrity looks on four women, capturing before and after shots of the ladies - and the results are amazing. 'The stars are under intense scrutiny to look at their best on the red carpet,' explained Aimee. 'And many of them spend millions of pounds on facials and hair treatments in the run up to the event, so they're not going to rush their make-up.' Aimee emphasises that the prep is just as important as the make-up, and she advises her clients to have regular laser facials in the run up to the event. 'The Oscars beauty look isn't trends-led,' she said. 'It's like a wedding day, stars just want to look the best versions of themselves, so dewy, pared-back skin rules.' Dani McCormack, 26, a PR from London, was also treated to an Oscar-worthy makeover . Aimee opts for products with long-lasting formulas and always completes the look with a clear, matte powder to ensure nothing budges - as modelled by 22-year-old Georgina Castle . Aimee achieves this flawless complexion with a careful skin prep regime. On the night of the awards, she recommends using a full mask to hydrate the skin before applying make-up. 'My clients enjoy these steps, it's like a home spa,' she said. She preps their skin with a primer (she loves Smashbox) and often mixes it with a foundation to ensure it doesn't look too heavy or cakey on camera. She adapts each look to the particular client based on their needs and preferences; but the secret behind every flawless red carpet look? Lighting. 'I use head torches, LED light panels and SAD lighting because it's essential to see how it all looks in different situations,' she explained. 'I always check contouring in a dark room and use a magnifying mirror in bright light to check lips and eyes. 'When Angelina Jolie had that white make-up fail, it was probably because her make-up artist dusted silica matte powder over her face in poor lighting.' On the night of the awards, she recommends using a full mask to hydrate the skin before applying make-up and suggests getting regular facial lasers to keep redness and acne at bay. Amrit Maghera, 31, models the results . Aimee opts for products with long-lasting formulas and always completes the look with a clear, matte powder to ensure nothing budges. For the more mature woman like Helen Mirren, who Aimee has worked with, she says skin maintenance is key. 'Helen is beautiful and she's never had work done, she just looks after her skin and always has,' she said. 'For women with skin like Helen's, it's essential to use lighter formulas that won't settle into lines; and emphasising eyebrows to add definition is key.' As for her male clients, who have included Colin Firth and Tom Ford, she swears by a brand called le maquillage pro - and is convinced Brad Pitt and 'most male celebrities' do too. 'Men are actually fussier than women,' she said. 'But less is more. For men, it's important to use a wax-based make-up because it's much more subtle.' Aimee created these beauty looks in collaboration with Sony as they launched their 4K TV. Whilst HD make-up has been on the lips of every beauty buff for a while, 4K TV broadcasts in more detail than ever before. Aimee said: 'The advent of 4K technology means one thing for our Hollywood beauties, a spotlight on their imperfections! 'This makes the prep, as well as the actually make-up application, extremely important. This year’s Oscar certainly relied on these techniques to keep them camera-ready, so I am delighted to share my secrets with other women.’","Aimee Adams talks FEMAIL through her beautifying routine .

"The new Defense Secretary  said that transgender Americans should not be kept from military service, explaining that the 'best people in our country' should be able to serve. Ashton Carter, who was sworn in as defense secretary last Tuesday, spoke during a town-hall meeting in Kandahar, part of a trip to Afghanistan. NBC News reports that Navy Lt Cmdr Jesse Ehrenfeld, a doctor, asked Carter about transgender soldiers trying to serve in an 'austere environment' such as Afghanistan. Openly serve: Ashton Carter, who was sworn in as defense secretary last Tuesday, said that there should not be prohibitions on trans Americans serving in the armed forces . 'We want to make our conditions and experience of service as attractive as possible to our best people in our country,' Carter said. 'I'm very open-minded about — otherwise about what their personal lives and proclivities are, provided they can do what we need them to do for us.' 'I don't think anything but their suitability for service should preclude them,' Carter added. The American Military Partner Association, which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families within the military, released a statement praising the comments. The organization also stated there was a need to examine 'outdated regulations that prevent the estimated 15,500 transgender service members currently in uniform from serving openly and honestly.' 'Thousands of transgender service members are currently doing the job, and doing it well, but are forced to do so in silence,' President of the AMPA Ashley Broadway-Mack said in a statement. Tour: Carter made the comments during a trip to Afghanistan, where American's troop presence has diminished after the 2014 drawdown . 'Forced to lie about something as fundamental as who they are in order to continue to serve.' Until last year, US service members could be dismissed for 'sexual and gender identity disorders,' according to the Palm Center, a think tank focused on issues of gender and sexuality. In August, the Defense Department eliminated the regulation, though Army, Navy and Air Force regulations still require transgender members to be discharged.","Ashton Carter, who was sworn in last Tuesday, made the comments during a trip to Afghanistan .

"Flight MH370 may have been deliberately flown off course by someone in the cockpit, a new documentary claims. Aviation disaster experts have analysed satellite data from the lost Malaysian Airlines flight and discovered that the plane flew on for hours after losing contact. Careful examination of the evidence has revealed that MH370 made three turns after the last radio call, first a turn to the left, then two more, taking the plane west, then south towards Antarctica. Scroll down for video . Heading south: Satellite data from Flight MH370 shows that the plane made several turns after the last radio call, before finally heading towards Antarctica . According to Malcolm Brenner, a world's leading expert in the causes of aviation disasters, those turns 'strongly suggest' someone in the cockpit deliberately flew MH370 off course. 'This accident has caught the attention of the world in a way I have not seen in a forty-year career in aviation,' Mr Brenner says. The claims are being made in a new National Geographic documentary out next month where Mr Brenner and a team of experts try to solve the mystery of MH370. This follows confident claims by the Australian co-ordinator of the search that the doomed jetliner will be found within the next few months. Evidence: According to Malcolm Brenner, a world's leading expert in the causes of aviation disasters, those turns 'strongly suggest' someone in the cockpit deliberately flew MH370 off course . Tracking it down:  Australian Transport Safety Bureau Commissioner Martin Dolan said he was sure his team would unearth the wreckage by then . As the current search for the Malaysia Airlines plane is set to wrap up by the end of May, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Commissioner Martin Dolan said he was hopeful his team would unearth the wreckage by then, News.com.au reported. But the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre is remaining tight lipped about the issue, saying the Chinese, Malaysian and Australian governments would be assessing what to do next. Flight MH370 vanished on March 8, 2014 while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. No trace of the jet has been recovered since then but Mr Dolan believes his team are close to discovering the wreckage. 'I don't wake up every day thinking 'This will be the day' but I do wake up every day hoping this will be it, and expecting that sometime between now and May that will be the day,' Commissioner Dolan told News Corp. 'It's been both baffling and from our point of view unprecedented - not only the mystery of it, but also on the scale of what we're doing to find the aircraft. 'As we keep on pointing out, we don't have a certainty only a confidence that we'll find the missing aircraft.' The search for MH370 has so far been fruitless, with the crash site initially thought to be in the South China Sea or Gulf of Thailand. Accident: Relatives of passengers of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 held placards during a protest demanding to know why the Malaysian government had announced recently that the fate of MH370 was an accident . But search efforts were then redirected to the southern part of the Indian Ocean. This late start meant any trace of the wreckage on the surface of the ocean floor would have sunk and it is thought some of the debris would have appeared on the shores of Sumatra in Western Indonesia. So far, they have been unsuccessful in tracking down any piece of the aircraft but experts were trying to predict its floating patterns to locate the wreckage site by considering 'how the aircraft would've collided with the water'. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, which, headed by Australia, is conducting the search says that so far the underwater operations have scoured 22,000 square kilometres of the ocean bed, equalling around 36 per cent of the priority search area. It is estimated that if there are no delays with vessels, equipment or from the weather, the underwater search will be mostly finished some time in May. The 'Go Phoenix' supply ship has remained in the area, 2,500km to the south west of Perth, western Australia, but three vessels involved in the underwater search have this week suspended operations to return to port in Australia for scheduled visits. Despite months of searching in the area, there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far.","New documentary tries to find out what happened to flight MH370 .

"A British soldier who left to fight alongside Kurdish militants has described ISIS as little more than 'office workers and villagers' who are high on drugs because they are so terrified. Jamie Read from Lanarkshire, Scotland, served in the British Army for four years before travelling to Syria in 2014 to join the battle against Islamic State extremists. Having returned home he has revealed he would be prepared to rejoin the fight - despite the fact that he and his family have been targeted by militants. Scroll down for video . Jamie Read (left and right) from Lanarkshire, Scotland, served in the British Army for four years before travelling to Syria in 2014 to join the battle against extremists . The 25-year-old said: 'All the stuff about IS being organised is not what I saw, they seem like office workers and villagers who were simply pointed in the right direction and told to get on with it.' Before travelling to Syria, Mr Read was given training  by Thor Tactical, a Czech private security agency offering self-defence courses, weapons classes and training in tactical fighting. They organised a recent meeting where he spoke about his experiences and his motivation for entering the war torn country. He said: 'I just could not look at this injustice. It was necessary to do something.' He had travelled to Syria using his own money after making contact with Kurdish People's Protection Units, the YPG, using a link he found on the internet. He had then been contacted via Facebook and eventually had a Skype interview a few days before he flew to Iraq, where he underwent a further personal interview and his details were checked. He said: 'They wanted to make sure I didn't have any connection to the Islamic State. After that I got my equipment, and was sent to the front line.' Having returned home Mr Read has revealed how he would be prepared to rejoin the fight - despite the fact that he and his family have been targeted by militants . Suggestions that IS are a well-organised and disciplined unit were not true, he claimed, adding: 'They are ordinary civilians from various places involved in the conflicts who have to fight. 'They do not have a choice, and they don't have have any information, or even any clear leadership. Many of them are heavily involved in taking drugs they are so terrified.' Mr Read fought with Kurdish Pashmerga, the military forces that fight in Syria, Iraq and Turkey. But he revealed that the forces he joined were not particularly disciplined either. He said: 'There is no planning. They say ""let's go this way"" and they go that way and they fight. But they are not afraid of IS, they are defending their families and their homes.' He added: 'I tried to pass on to them some of the basics of military tactics, but they were not interested, because it was in conflict with their ideology.' Many people spoke English, he said, and he also learned some Kurdish words. He had even been given a Kurdish name by his fellow soldiers. 'The logistics left something to be desired - they would eat rice on the frontline and there were not even enough bowls to go round, so seven people would be eating out of the same bowl, and if one was sick, they would all be sick.' He said that although he had left the frontline to return to the UK, he was now worried about his life and that of his family after 'fanatics started to blackmail me and my family'. 'There was a reward of £250,000 for my death,' he said. 'Of course, there is a big danger that the Islamic State will target us, I am now a public figure in the war against them, and a hit against me would be probably something they try to use in their PR. 'After the Paris attacks I had police guards around my house. Police were sure that it was my turn next. I guess that was a bit of an eye-opener but I'm sure it will work out well in the end.' Mr Read has a girlfriend and a son in the UK but said he was still prepared to return to Syria. He said: 'The matter is complicated though because of all the information about me, and the fact that my photograph was so widely shared.'","Jamie Read left to fight in Syria in 2014 after four years in the British Army .

"A suburban New York police chief says a retired officer's suicide note indicates that the killing of his teenage daughters in their beds was a premeditated act. Harrison Police believe Glen Hochman, 52, shot and killed his daughters, 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna, and himself on Saturday. His wife and a third, older, daughter Samantha were not at home. Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said the note was found with Hochman's body in the garage of their home in the Westchester County town of Harrison. Marraccini said Monday that former White Plains Officer Glen Hochman had no known health or psychiatric problems. He says there also were no indications of alcohol or drug use. Scroll down for videos . Dead: Glen Hochman, (back left) 52, a police officer of 22 years who only retired in January, is believed to have murdered his two daughters Deanna Hochman, 13 (front, right) and Alissa Hochman, (front, left) 17, on Saturday afternoon. Above, he is also seen with wife Anamarie (center) and eldest daughter Samantha (right) Investigation: Police say that the couple was discussing separation at the time of the killings and that there had been a family discussion about the subject. They would not say if this was considered a motive . Scene: Police arrived at this home at 1 Adelphi Avenue in the Westchester County village of Harrison on Saturday night to find  Hochman and his two teen daughters dead . Marraccini said 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna apparently were asleep when they were shot sometime after 2 a.m. Saturday. Their parents had discussed a possible separation in mid-January. Hochman's wife went to police on Friday to report a non-violent argument because an acquaintance had urged her to document such incidents. And on the day before the killings, Glen Hochman's wife Anamarie had gone to police to report an argument over an $80 cellphone bill, said Harrison police Chief Anthony Marraccini, but there was no indication of violence. 'She didn't want us to pursue it, she just wanted to document it,' the chief said of the 50-year-old mother. The chief said his investigation had turned up that there had been 'a family discussion about a possible separation.' The girls' bodies were found in the main level of the home. Three dogs had also been shot to death. Marraccini said Monday that the handgun recovered near Hochman's body, believed to be the weapon in the killings, belonged to Hochman. Family torn apart: Glen Hochman is seen here with his two victims, daughters Alissa (right) and Deanna (center). Anamarie and Samantha were not home at the time of the tragedy, police have confirmed . Killed: Alissa, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, and Deanna, 13, were found dead around 3.50pm . He and his daughters were were found dead about 3.50pm inside their home in the village of Harrison, about 20 miles northeast of Manhattan. Marraccini said police went to the home in the Westchester County village of Harrison after a person reported that no one was answering the door. 'It looks at this time that the father killed the two girls and then himself,' Marraccini said. He said Monday that there was not yet any official finding of cause of death. White Plains Police Commissioner David Chong released a statement identifying the former officer as Hochman, and called the deaths 'an unfathomable tragedy'. Chong said the department is 'shocked and horrified by the news', according to The Journal News. 'We can only pray for the family,' he said. 'Officer Hochman served this department and the city of White Plains with honor and integrity for over 22 years.' Last year, Hochman won the department's lifesaving award for keeping an unresponsive man alive until paramedics arrived. Hochman suffered an Achilles' injury in early May when he fell while helping a disabled motorist. He had time off to recover according to his union lawyer, Warren Roth, who had known Hochman for more than 25 years, since both worked as EMTs with the Harrison ambulance corps. He said Hochman sought a disability retirement because of the injury but had not been depressed over it as he was planning for retirement soon anyway . 'It's just devastating to a lot of people,' Mr Roth said. Murder-suicide: Investigators worked through the night on Saturday inside the home. Police said they found a letter next to Hochman's body, and that the note 'gave some indication of motive' Victims: The Harrison school district said that Deanna (left) and her sister Alissa (right) were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy' 'He was always a quiet, reserved guy, nothing ever seemed to unsettle him... And he was wonderful with his daughters, a devoted father. That's the scary part. There was absolutely no seeing this coming.' Residents of the upper middle-class neighborhood discussed the shootings in quiet tones as they shoveled snow Sunday. Howard Hollander, 52, an airline pilot who lives five doors down from the Hochmans, said Hochman 'was always taking care of the property, landscaping, cleaning up the yard.' 'The girls said hi whenever they passed,' Mr Hollander said. 'I remember one was learning to drive and beeped at us as she went by.' He added, 'There was no indication at all of any problem, that something like this would happen.' Another neighbor, Dante Garritano, 52, an engineer, said he went outside when he saw ambulances and police cars Saturday. 'I walked out and I heard a woman crying, screaming, on her phone, 'My God, they're dead. He killed himself,'' Mr Garritano said. In a statement on the Harrison school district's website, Superintendent of Schools Louis N. Wool said Alissa, a high school senior, and Deanna were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy.' He said the response of the district community to past tragedies has been inspiring and that he expects the students and staff will be no less resilient this time. 'In this awful moment, let us remember how proud we are of (the high school community), how much they have helped others and how much they will help others again,' Wool said.

"Killed: Slovakian Rene Tkacik was crushed to death by a tonne of wet concrete while working on a Crossrail building site . An experienced construction worker was crushed to death by a tonne of wet concrete while working on a Crossrail building site, an inquest heard today. Slovakian Rene Tkacik was killed in a tunnel below Fisher Street, in Holborn, on March 7 last year, becoming the first fatality on the £15 billion project. Mr Tkacik, of Hackney Road, east London, had been working in the UK to earn money to send home to his family in Slovakia so he could pay for his daughter Esther to go to university, a statement from his wife Renata said. The court heard that Mr Tkacik, 44, 'didn't know what he was supposed to do' on some occasions because of his lack of English. He was  crushed by a tonne of concrete after he went to check the surface of the tunnel - suffering 'devastating injuries incompatible with life'. He  was employed by contractor BFK and had been working on the section of tunnel which had been widened. His mother, widow and three sisters were in court today for the inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court. Speaking to the family Coroner Mary Hassell said: 'I accepted that we will have a lot of detailed discussion about the matters of concrete spraying. 'But I recognise at the heart of all of this is your loved one.' In a statement read in court Mr Tkacik's widow Renata said she last saw her husband five days before his death. She said: 'He studied as a miner and worked as a blaster in a uranium mine. 'When he worked in the mine he was responsible for people's lives. He worked in different countries. 'He moved to Spain and worked there as a cement sprayer and he had huge experience in that. He was well read and taught himself Spanish.' She explained he came to the UK to work on Crossrail as a concrete sprayer to raise money to send his daughter to university. She said: 'To work on Crossrail he had to complete four exams which he passed first time. Not many people were admitted to the project and he did the exams in Spanish . First casualty: The 44-year-old construction worker was the first fatality on the £15 billion project (file picture) 'He had difficult living conditions and wasn't able to sleep properly and was constantly tired. His English was rudimentary and he was working with a lot of people speaking English. At times he didn't know what he was supposed to do. She added: 'He would take a dictionary to work and people were rude to him because he didn't understand them. 'He had become so tired and found himself a flat. I came to visit him there and I hardly recognised him, he had got out of his sleep routine and found it hard to get back into it. The 2nd of March was the last time I saw him.' The court also heard how he kept to himself in the evenings and would call his wife instead of meeting up with co-workers as he did not drink and never did drugs. The jury also heard from Metropolitan police detective sergeant Kavin McGrath who showed the jury a digital image of the tunnel where Mr Tkacik had been working when he died. He showed the court where the machine which had been spaying the concrete on to the walls of the tunnel and where the concrete had fallen. He said: 'At the time of the fall, the concrete spraying machine had run out of concrete and was waiting to be refilled. 'It appeared the deceased was in an exclusion area underneath the concrete. He also had a shovel in his hand at the time the concrete fell. Scene of the accident: Mr Tkacik was killed in a tunnel below Fisher Street, in Holborn on March 7 last year . 'It was just under a tonne of concrete that came down, which is the equivalent of a bag of building sand.' The detective added: 'It happened within a second and people further up the tunnel came down to help and they pulled him away from the danger zone and tried to resuscitate him.' An ambulance crew were first called to the scene and then the London Air Ambulance but he was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.14am. Before the start of proceedings campaigners and union members who were part of the Construction Safety Campaign protested outside calling for a full investigation into the health and safety of Crossrail. The coroner heard submissions from the family's legal team for the evidence from two witnesses to be heard, who would have given information about the safety processes at other Crossrail sites. However the request was rejected by the Ms Hassle who said: 'There is a danger this inquest will turn into a review of Crossrail, this inquest cannot do that and this is not a public inquiry to consider Crossrail's operations across London. 'The role of this inquest is to look into the circumstances of Mr Tkacik's death.'","Slovakian Rene Tkaci killed in a tunnel below Fisher Street, in Holborn .

The Boeing 757-300 flight MT-1125 was at around 34,000 feet to the south of Budapest when smoke was sighted in the cabin and the plane was redirected on Saturday.

"Mike Valenzo, 72, was found dead Saturday in Staten Island, New York . A wealthy supermarket owner died after apparently slipping on ice just outside his Staten Island mansion on one of the coldest nights of the year. Mike Valenzo, 72, was found by a business partner Saturday morning on the front steps of his home - hours after leaving a birthday party on foot. It was around 2F outside at the time.

Guests said he left around 10.30pm to make the short walk home - but apparently never made it. According to the Staten Island Advance, Valenzo was found face-up outside his home.

It comes after his manager said the two-time world champion was doing well after spending the night on a ward. Luis Garcia Abad told the Spanish media: 'He is well and I don't think there will be any problems. 'The impact was quite strong but fortunately, it was nothing. He was conscious and able to speak. 'He was taken to hospital as a precaution and they have done all the necessary tests, which have all come out well. 'But he will need to spend another 24 hours under observation. The tests will be repeated on Monday.' He said that Alonso was 'hitting the brake and changing gears until the moment of impact.' After the crash, McLaren said the two-time former world champion was 'conscious and able to speak' while receiving first aid at the circuit's medical centre, but had been taken to hospital for 'precautionary checks'. After several hours of tests and observation, the team later added that Alonso was 'uninjured' but had suffered concussion in the accident. Family support: The driver's fatherJose Luis Alonso is pictured leaving the hospital in Sant Cugat, north of Barcelona . Aid: Formula One driver Fernando Alonso taken to hospital by helicopter after being involved in a crash at speeds of up to 150mph . Although Alonso was conscious and able to speak to doctors after the incident, he was airlifted to hospital for precautionary checks . Team director Eric Boullier said: 'Fernando's accident was just one of those things that happens in testing. 'Fortunately, he's fine, but was concussed during the accident, which therefore required an overnight stay in hospital as a precaution. That's normal practice after a concussion.' The Spaniard crashed after completing 20 laps. The accident occurred at turn three, when Alonso went off course and the right-hand side of his car hit the wall. A Circuit de Catalunya spokesman said all driving on the course - which is located in Montmeló, in the north of the city - was stopped until 2pm local time (1pm GMT). The spokesman had said: 'We hope that everything's alright and all ends with just a shock.' McLaren has been plagued by technical problems after switching to Honda engines ahead of the upcoming season.

Damage: Fernando Alonso's McLaren car is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck in Barcelona . Taken away: The crash was on the final day of the Formula One pre-season test at the Circuit de Catalunya . A McLaren spokesman said: 'Fernando Alonso's McLaren-Honda car left the track at Turn Three, causing the right-hand side of his car to strike the wall. 'Fernando was driven to the circuit's Medical Centre where the circuit's doctors gave him first aid. He was conscious and spoke with the doctors. 'However, as per usual procedure in such circumstances, he was then airlifted to hospital where he is undergoing precautionary checks.' Help: Medical staff hold sheets around Alonso  as he is evacuated from the medical centre to the helicopter . Leaving: It was unclear whether the crash was a result of a driver error or a malfunction with the car . Airlifted: People watch as Alonso  is transported to hospital in a helicopter after crashing on the circuit . Ferrari, the two-time champion's former team, tweeted: 'All the best Fernando.' Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari.

"Two hunters from an ancient tribe show no fear as they use a bow and arrow to catch their dinner - just yards from a fully grown cheetah. Photographer Jack Somerville, 26, captured the spectacular images in the Naankuse Wildlife Reserve in central Namibia, Africa. The tribesmen appear to be entirely comfortable standing next to the potentially dangerous animal as they go about their work. Scroll down for video . Fearless: Two hunters from an ancient tribe look unconcerned as they use a bow and arrow to catch their dinner - just yards from a fully grown cheetah . One of the hunters sits down and looks relaxed as the fully grown cheetah strolls around behind him in the Naankuse Wildlife Reserve in central Namibia, Africa . Relaxed: Both man and beast appear at one with each other as one of the hunters takes aim with a bow and arrow . No sudden moves: The two men monitor the movements of the fully grown wild cheetah. The animal, called Aiko, was brought to the reserve after being rescued . Mr Somerville, from north London, took the pictures after spending time with the San people, who are members of indigenous hunter-gatherer people in southern Africa. They can also be called 'bushmen' or 'basarwa' and their territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Mr Somerville travelled to Namibia to capture their way of life and their attitude around wild animals on camera. He said: 'These two hunters are completely relaxed with the cheetah, a large male called Aiko. 'As with any big cat which is not born in captivity, Aiko is not tame. However, once you know the correct way to behave around him and respect his space it is possible to get up close to him. 'The two hunters know Aiko and were therefore comfortable with him. The cheetah is a rescued cheetah and resident on the reserve. At one with nature: Photographer Jack Somerville, 26, captured the spectacular images while spending time with the San people in the Naankuse Wildlife Reserve in central Namibia, Africa . Even though the cheetah was born in the wild and is not tame, these two huntsmen seem so in tune with nature that they are comfortable with being around potentially dangerous animals . 'The San have a deep respect for wildlife, due to co-existing alongside them for centuries. The San are thought to be the oldest living culture on earth. 'This respect for nature and the environment is something that has been lost by many other cultures the world over.' Mr Somerville photographed the two men as they were hunting for warthog. He said: 'The San hunt on foot, often tracking animals for days. They use small bows and arrows, as well as snares for smaller animals. 'The arrows are tipped with poison made from larvae found in Marula fruit. Normally they will hunt anything from guinea fowl to the larger antelopes. Aiko was taken to the reserve when he was captured in a trap set by a farmer when he was a cub, along with three of his siblings . The San people can also be called 'bushmen' or 'basarwa' and their territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa . 'However the San do not hunt more food than they need to feed their village. 'They also gather food from bush vegetation, making sure to replant anything they dig up to ensure nothing is taken away from the land.' Aiko was taken to the reserve when he was captured in a trap set by a farmer when he was a cub, along with three of his siblings. Farmers will often set traps for big cats to stop them preying on their livestock. The two San huntsman were at the reserve to teach their ancient skills to the younger, more modernised San people who live in central Namibia.","Stunning set of pictures show two fearless hunters from an ancient tribe standing next to a large male cheetah .

"Chewing his favorite toy and surrounded by devastated police officers, this is the heartbreaking tribute made to a veteran K-9 just before he was put down. The nine-year-old German shepherd named Judge was driven to Swedesboro Animal Hospital in Woolwich Township, New Jersey on roads flanked by saluting canine cops. His handlers questioned whether he would be strong enough to make it to the door, following years of deteriorating health problems. Scroll down for video . Guard of honor: K-90 cops with their canine companions salute as the car carrying Judge arrives outside said St. Francis Veterinary Hospital in South Jersey . Standing tall: Officers knew the nine-year-old would be able to walk inside when he bit down on his favorite toy - which is used during canine training . But his tight squeeze on the sleeve he used while he was being trained proved he had enough energy for one final walk. Vets and specialists surprised the West Deptford Police department by lining up inside the clinic. According to Gloucester County Online, one of them was sobbing as Judge passed. He was then taken into a treatment room - and was put to sleep. Judge’s work aided in the arrest of 152 people, the seizure of three vehicles, the removal of three handguns from the streets, drug seizures, and the confiscation of more than $47,000 in cash, said police. He was recruited in 2007 and was a key fixture in the department until he was forced to retire in 2013 because of issues with his teeth. Last June however, his health started to get worse - suffering from vomiting, hair loss and bloating. He was taken to see a vet, who found several large masses over his body. After that cops made the difficult decision to end his life. More than than $13,000 was raised in one day to help pay for the German Shepherd dog’s mountain of medical bills last year, but it was not enough to save him.

"A top judge has backed a ruling which told the ex-wife of a millionaire racehorse surgeon to 'get a job' because she has no right to be 'supported for life' at her former husband's expense. Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, has rejected an application by Tracey Susan Wright, 51, who claimed she should continue to receive maintenance support from her ex-husband Ian. Last year, Mr Wright, 59, who is one of the country's top equine surgeons, went to the High Court to try and reduce the £75,000-a-year in maintenance and school fees he was ordered to pay his ex-wife following their divorce in 2008. Tracey Susan Wright was told to 'get a job' by a High Court judge who rejected her bid to keep receiving £75,000 for maintenance and school fees from former husband Ian Wright, a leading equine surgeon . At the time, Judge Lynn Roberts agreed that the payments should come to an end since there was no good reason why Mrs Wright had not taken up any paid work in the six years since the divorce. Mrs Wright, who lives with the couple’s two children in Newmarket, Suffolk, challenged the ruling, claiming that having to care for their 10-year-old daughter 'was an inherent restriction on her ability to develop any kind of earning capacity in the next five years.' However, Lord Pitchford has now upheld Judge Roberts’ initial ruling and supported the idea that it is ‘imperative that she go out to work and support herself.' The lengthy court battle began when the couple – who married in 1997 - divorced in 2008, having separated in 2006. At the time, a judge ruled that they should sell their £1.3million seven-bedroom home, set in 16 acres of countryside in Suffolk, and split the proceeds. It meant Mrs Wright – a former legal secretary and riding instructor - walked away from the divorce with a lump sum which enabled her to buy a £450,000 mortgage-free house in the heart of Newmarket, Suffolk, plus stabling for her horse and her daughters' ponies. Mrs Wright claimed that caring for the couple's children restricted her ability to earn enough money to support them. The 51-year-old is pictured outside the home she shares with her daughters in Suffolk . As part of the divorce order, she was also handed £75,000 yearly payments, of which £33,200 was spousal maintenance for her personal upkeep. She opted to remain a stay-at-home mother following the split and has so far refused to take up any paid employment. It prompted Mr Wright, who runs a cutting edge equine hospital in Newmarket which carries out life-saving surgery on top-class horses, to approach the High Court to seek a reduction in the hefty maintenance bills he was paying his former partner. Victory: Mr Wright said it was not fair he was expected to support his wife long into retirement when she refused to work . He protested that it was not fair that he was expected to keep supporting his ex-wife indefinitely, even after his retirement, while she made 'no effort whatsoever to seek work.' The court heard that Mr Wright steadfastly made the payments, but was worried that supporting his wife would be unaffordable after he retires at 65. Ruling in Mr Wright’s favour, Judge Roberts agreed last year that there was no good reason why Mrs Wright had not taken up work and criticised her for being 'evasive on the subject of her own earning capacity.' 'The world of work has innumerable possibilities these day...vast numbers of women with children just get on with it and Mrs Wright should have done as well,' the judge said. 'I do not think the children will suffer if Mrs Wright has to work, and indeed a working mother at this stage of their lives may well provide them with a good role model. 'It is possible to find work that fits in with childcare responsibilities. I reject her other reasons relating to responsibilities for animals, or trees, or housekeeping. 'Mrs Wright has made no effort whatsoever to seek work or to update her skills...I am satisfied that she has worked on the basis...that she would be supported for life. 'It is essential...that she starts to work now.' At the time, the judge ruled that the personal maintenance payments from her ex-husband must stop, with a gradual tailing off over a five-year period leading up to his retirement. However, Mrs Wright challenged the ruling, claiming that Judge Roberts' order would cause 'a plummeting in the standard of living' of the youngest child. The court heard that the couple's daughter is a boarding pupil at a public school. Mark Johnston, acting on behalf of Mrs Wright, argued that the assets Mrs Wright received in the split 'wouldn't come anywhere near allowing the wife to adjust without undue hardship...especially with one child still at home.' Mr Wright runs a cutting edge equine hospital in Newmarket which carries out life-saving surgery on top-class horses (pictured). His wife, a former legal secretary, has been a stay-at-home mother since the divorce . Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice in London (pictured), rejected the application by Mrs Wright, which claimed she should continue to receive maintenance support from her ex-husband Ian . However, Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting in the Court of Appeal, has now rejected her challenge and upheld the original ruling. He said: 'The time had come to recognise that, at the time of his retirement, the husband should not be paying spousal maintenance. 'The wife had done nothing since 2008 to look for work, retrain or to prepare herself for work. 'Judge Roberts did not accept any of the explanations put forward by the wife for her inactivity and ruled that it was important that she obey the order. 'She had harsh words for the wife for her complete failure to confront her obligation to contribute financially. She found the wife exaggerated her income needs. 'There is a general expectation that, once children are in year two, mothers can begin part-time work and make a financial contribution.' Mr Wright had been found to be 'a man of integrity who had done nothing to mislead the court.' However, the court heard how the judge deemed the wife to be 'an unsatisfactory witness; particularly on the subject of her own earning capacity'. Lord Justice Pitchford said: 'The judge made it very clear that, within a couple of years, she would be expected to contribute financially. 'The question is whether there is a real prospect of establishing that the judge gave inadequate reasons for her decision that the husband should provide no spousal maintenance in his retirement. In my view there is no such prospect'. He added that 'the order was never intended to provide the wife with an income for life' and concluded: 'The onus will henceforth be on her. This application is dismissed.'

"More senior bank bosses are to face hefty fines if they fail to prevent wrongdoing under a crackdown on City failure by the Bank of England. New rules to hold senior figures to account when things go wrong are to be extended to also cover non-executive directors to force them to 'run their firms responsibly'. But there are concerns the move could deter the best people from rising through the ranks, fearing being held to account for problems on their watch. New rules to hold senior figures to account when things go wrong are to be extended to also cover non-executive directors to force them to 'run their firms responsibly' The Bank of England is strengthening rules covering senior bankers, known as the Senior Persons Regime. It includes the threat of a lifetime ban, large fines and the power to jail bankers for reckless misconduct. Sanctions will be imposed if a senior manager responsible for an area where a breach of the rules occurred 'cannot demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to avoid or stop it'. In addition to bank chairmen, it will cover senior independent directors, and the heads of risk, audit and remuneration committees. There is also a new criminal offence which could see senior managers held liable for reckless decisions leading to the failure of a bank. The tougher rules were drawn up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and scandals including bank mis-selling and rigging lending rates. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor and head of the BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority, said: 'Senior managers will be held individually accountable if the areas they are responsible for fail to meet our requirements. 'Our new accountability regime will hold all senior managers, including non-executive directors, to a clear standard of behaviour and we will take action where they fail to meet this.' In an article in the Financial Times he stressed that expanding the scope of the rules was the right way to ensure that those responsible for the running of financial institutions are held to account. He said: 'Organisations need to make sure they have on the board people with the right skills, who are prepared to dedicate an appropriate amount of time to this vital role. 'It is not our intention that non-executives should take on executive roles, which would compromise their independence as a result of these regulatory changes.' Andrew Bailey, the head of the BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority, said senior managers must be individually accountable . He insisted that the new criminal offence will only be used 'in the most egregious cases', adding: 'We do not seek to collect scalps. Success will be well-governed firms, where senior managers know what is expected and run their firms responsibly.' However the threat of the new rules sparked claims that senior bankers would resign. Last year HSBC was forced to deny that the threat of jail led to at least one resignation from its board. Tony Woodcock, a partner at law firm Stephenson Harwood, said widening the rules to cover non-executive directors would mean banks will 'will lose some good people, and perhaps take on some of the B team instead'. He told the FT: 'Their liability is greater than ever, not least because of the reversal of the burden of proof. Fines are likely to be significantly higher than before as the regulators seek to make examples at the top of the industry. Who needs that at the end of their careers?'","Bank of England widens scope of new sanctions against bank bosses .

The carrier's warplanes began operations this morning, said Le Figaro newspaper, which is accompanying Defence Minister . Jean-Yves Le Drian ahead of an official announcement he is set . to make on the carrier today. The news came as it was claimed that U.S.-led airstrikes on ISIS targets had resulted in the deaths of 1,600 people - the majority of them terrorists - in Syria and Iraq over the past five months. France was the first country to join the coalition . in airstrikes against ISIS insurgents in Iraq, who . have also taken control of large parts of neighbouring Syria . during the course of the civil war there.

The Charles de Gaulle arrived in the Persian Gulf on February 15, Stars And Stripes reported. It completed a port visit to Bahrain yesterday, which French officials told the military journal was to finalise 'operational details' with the U.S. 5th Fleet. The 42,000-ton, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is accompanied by an attack submarine, several frigates, including a British anti-submarine frigate and a refueling ship. The Charles de Gaulle is carrying a dozen Rafale fighter-bombers and nine Super Étendard strike jets, according to Le Figaro. They join a further nine fighter jets, a maritime patrol aircraft and . a refuelling plane at France's base in the United Arab Emirates. It also operates six Mirage fighter . jets from Jordan. With the Charles de Gaulle, there are now more than 3,000 . French military personnel involved in the operation. French aircraft this weekend struck targets in Sinjar, the region of northern Iraq where thousands of members of the Yazidi minority group have been under siege for months by ISIS militants. 'By late [Saturday] evening, a patrol took off on a planned air strike to destroy ISIL combat positions,' a spokesman for the ministry said. 'Around ten targets were destroyed by French fighter jets using AASM1 bombs.' French Air Force jets made a total of 22 sorties over Iraq, the statement said. Blast: News that France is engaging ISIS targets in Iraq comes as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said U.S.-led airstrikes (pictured in the Syrian city of Kobane) had already killed 1,600 people . Militants: The flow of European fighters to ISIS-held territory is drying up due to tighter restrictions that prevent would-be jihadis from travelling, fighters from the group said . France has barred six people from leaving the country because they wanted to join extremists in Syria. It the first such travel ban under a new law aimed at keeping French radicals from gaining violent experience abroad. French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve says some 40 others will face travel bans in the coming weeks. He did not name the six. The bans issued today are the first since a sweeping anti-terrorism law passed last year. The government is especially worried since attacks in Paris last month killed 20 people, including three gunmen claiming ties to Islamic extremists in Syria and Yemen. An Interior Ministry official says the passports and ID cards of the six have been declared invalid for six months, a measure that can be extended for up to two years. News that France is engaging ISIS targets in Iraq comes as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said U.S.-led airstrikes had already killed 1,600 people. Almost of those killed are understood to have been aligned with ISIS or with rival Sunni terror group and Al-Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. The monitor recorded a total of 62 civilian deaths as a result of the bombing campaign. America and several Arab nations launched a bombing campaign against the militants in Syria last September. The operation built campaign against the group in neighbouring Iraqi territory. The flow of European fighters to ISIS-held territory is drying up due to tighter restrictions that prevent would-be jihadis from travelling, fighters from the group said. Fighters in Syria and Iraq said the impact was limited on the battlefield since European fighters make up only a fraction of ISIS forces. 'Now most of the fighters are coming from Asian countries, like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. They are tough fighters,' an ISIS source said.","France's Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier has been deployed to Iraq .

"This is the moment the Czech version of the Oscars was duped into inviting a fake Jim Carrey on stage during its televised awards ceremony. A man pretending to be the Dumb and Dumber actor was allowed on stage where he was greeted with applause from the audience - with some clearly realising it was not actually the Hollywood funnyman. Organisers had put on VIP red carpet treatment for the conman who was showered in golden confetti during his appearance at the glamorous event in the capital, Prague. A man pretending to be the Dumb and Dumber actor was allowed on stage (pictured) where he was greeted with applause from the audience . Officials at the Czech Lion Awards (Cesky lev) had been contacted by people claiming to represent Jim Carrey, claiming the actor was in the area and wanted to attend. The Czech Lions are the equivalent to the Academy Awards in the Czech Republic, and the callers are said to have told organisers that it would be an honour for the Truman Show star to attend. They were asked not to make the invitation public until his appearance because of security concerns. Organisers were bombarded with messages from fans pointing out that the Jim Carrey on the stage was a fake - and they finally accepted a mistake had been made. Organisers had put on VIP red carpet treatment for the conman (left on stage). Some members of the audiecen clearly realised it was not actually the Hollywood funnyman . Officials at the Czech Lion Awards had been contacted by people claiming to represent Jim Carrey (pictured), claiming the actor was in the area and wanted to attend . But the embarrassing appearance had already been broadcast live across the country on Czech television. Film director Jan Sverak, who supervised the ceremony, said: 'We have become very likely the target of a very elaborate hoax. I'm so sorry.' Both he and the organisers had earlier insisted that it was the real Jim Carrey who appeared. Even the award host Lucie Vyborna had insisted he was real, telling Czech newspaper Blesk shortly after the ceremony. She said: 'Of course the real Jim Carrey was on the stage. I knew that he would come but I did not know what he would do there. The impersonator was showered in golden confetti during his appearance at the glamorous event in the capital, Prague . Jim Carrey (left as Lloyd Christmas) starred alongside Jeff Daniels (right as Harry Dunne) in Dumb and Dumber . 'He appeared for a very short time and people did not have chance to recognise him. I have heard people suggesting it was a lookalike but I can say no, it was really him.' But after then admitting they were wrong Jan Sverak added: 'I am very sorry, I apologise. It was not my intention, but I must salute someone's perfect game in managing to con us.' The fake Carrey, who is still unidentified, came with a translator and his own security, and went through the ceremony preparations just like the real star would have been expected to, according to a statement by the ceremony's organisers. A spokesman for the awards added: 'Nothing indicated it was a ruse and we did not pay any money to the false actor.' This was the 22nd year for the ceremony. The Best Film prize went to The Way Out (Cesta ven), a gritty drama set in northern Moravia where anti-Roma sentiment is widespread.","Fake Jim Carrey was allowed on stage at the ceremony in capital, Prague .

'My lawyer went to Rome and got a letter to Pope Francis, asking him to help, and it looks like the pope is going to do it,' Morgan's widow, Olga Goodwin, told reporters from her Ohio home. Scroll down for video . Olga Morgan, seen here with husband William with daughters Olgeta (left) and Loretta  (right) believes she might finally have her husband's remains returned from Cuba after five decades . Morgan met his wife Olga during the Cuban revolution, and can be seen here with his future wife in the country's mountains . The Miami Herald reports that Argentine-born Pope Francis was instrumental with helping kick off negotiations to normalize relations between the two countries. Gerardo Rollison, Goodwin's attorney, declined to talk details but agreed a deal seemed possible. 'But I will say that I’m more optimistic now than I’ve been ever been that we’re going to get this done,' he said. Families in Miami have also been trying to get back the bodies of loved ones killed in 1961's Bay of Pigs invasion. Many are skeptical about the possibility of success. 'My mother tried for a long time to get my father’s body returned, but the Cuban government wasn’t cooperating and the Red Cross couldn’t do anything,' Maria Maria Werlau, executive director of the Cuba Archive, told reporters. Her father, Armando Cañizares, died at the Bay of Pigs. Few, such as the daughter of an American bomber pilot for the CIA, have succeeded. Morgan was popular among U.S. reporters as he was one of the few U.S. citizens who had attained a significant rank in the revolution . 'The Castros have kept it a big secret where the bodies were buried, or even if they were buried at all,” said Janet Ray, who spent a decade sending letters to Castro before finally getting the remains of her father, Pete, back home. 'It’s a very emotional thing.' One Miami Herald reporter, Bonnie Anderson, even wrote a heartfelt story about how she was banned from seeing her father Howard's grave for almost two decades. Howard Anderson had been executed in 1962 after being accused of being a U.S. spy. 'It was just an empty hole in the ground,” Bonnie Anderson said of the grave. 'The caretaker, who I had met on my first visit, told me that after my story ran, somebody from the government ordered him to dig up the body and throw it away.' Morgan was a staunch supporter of Castro insisting to news media that the revolutionary was not a communist . In the case of Wiliam Morgan, he once helped lead rebel troops in the anti-Barista forces. As one of the few Americans to have a high rank among the rebels he was well known to U.S. media and told reporters Castro was not a communist, his activities prompting the U.S. goverment to revoke his citizenship. Castro went so far as to call him 'the kind of North American that Cuba needs.' While there, Morgan married another guerrilla, Olga Rodriguez. But there were hints he for his safety. As the Herald noted: 'If something happens to me,' he once told Look magazine, 'then you know the commies have really taken over.' Morgan eventually decided the communists were running things, but too late. Castro executed him in early 1961. Olga finally fled Cuba while his mothr, Loretta, began campaigning for his body's return. Morgan was arrested after turning on Castro and subsequently executed in 1961 . With Obama in office, Rollison was finally able to obtain a travel permit. 'From congresspersons to senators to people in the Treasury and State Departments, our efforts have gotten a friendly hearing, and those efforts are still going on,' Rollison said, adding that 'within the confines of existing laws, there is a mechanism that would allow the repatriation of William Morgan’s remains.' Rollison believes return of the remains 'would be one more step in the resolution of humanitarian issues between Cuba and the United States.'","With diplomatic relations softening between the US and Cuba, the family of William Morgan say things are 'looking good' to have his remains returned .

"An underwater graveyard filled with the bones of extinct giant lemurs up to the size of a gorilla has been discovered in a cave in Madagascar. Divers found hundreds of fossilised bones and skeletons of the primitive primates as they explored flooded inland caves on the west coast of Madagascar. The perfectly preserved fossils, which have yet to be properly dated, are thought to be up to 4,000 years old. Scientists leading the study of the fossils believe there could be thousands of individuals buried in the soft silt at the bottom of the cave. Scroll down for video . This foot long skull of Megaladapis edwardsi is the largest lemur found in the caves in western Madagascar . Among the fossils at the base of the caves was a foot long skull from a species of lemur that weighed as much as 165lbs (75kg) - the same as a female gorilla. The discovery of the remains of so many giant lemurs, and other extinct species, in one place has left scientists baffled. It is very unusual to get the bones so many individuals in one place, particularly as most were complete and did not appear to have been disturbed since they had died. Palaeontologists say the animals could have ended up in the cave in a number of ways: . First they could have been brought there by a predator - in one of the three caves the remains of an extinct carnivore known as the giant fossa. It is thought to have been its den. However, few of the lemur remains showed signs that they had been gnawed or damaged after death, suggesting they had not been eaten by a predator. Another theory is that the caves were a sort of graveyard that provided a quiet place for animals to die. It is still unusual to get so many in one place. Another possibility is that the cave had supported a rich and functioning ecosystem that flooded, killing whatever was inside the cave. Finally, the bodies of the animals could have been carried into the cave by a flood. Palaeontologists say they have also found the remains of another lemur that grew to be as large as a gorilla and weighed hundreds of pounds when fully grown. Among the fossils, the researchers have also discovered the bones from elephant birds, corned crocodiles, rodents and hippos that roamed the island landscape thousands of years ago. However, most of the species found in the caves are now extinct and scientists are baffled as to how so many diverse species ended up in one place. Professor Alfred Rosenberger, an evolutionary primatologist at Brooklyn College in New York, who has been leading the recovery of the fossils, said: 'Nothing like this has ever been found before. It is really an enormous number of fossils all in one place. 'They are very complete, which is unusual in palaeontology. Here everything is together in one place. The preservation is really incredible.' Speaking to Mail Online he added: 'We know there are hundreds of specimens visible on the surface of the cave floor, and we estimate there are actually thousands. There are fossils in the sediment that will have to be extracted.' He said it is still unclear how the animals ended up in the cave but they may have been carried there by a flood. He said: 'That is a major question that only can be addressed with additional research. 'The common sense hypothesis is that many were accumulated in flooding episodes of some kind. Cyclones are pretty common in Madagascar. The fossilised giant lemur skulls, like the one above, were found often with complete skeletons in the caves . The caves were found in Tsimanampesotse National Park close to the west coast of the island of Madagascar . This artist's impression of Megaladapis shows how the giant 165lb lemur would have looked . 'But the questions is actually a complex one, and we will need data from a variety of sources to figure that out.' A team of specialist cave divers found the fossils as they explored three large flooded inland caves in the Tsimanampesotse National Park called Malaza Mongo, Mitoho and Aven. In the Aven Cave they discovered huge numbers of lemur fossils while there were also some found in the other caves. Similar fossils had been found in the past in other nearby caves, but no where near in as many numbers. Those were estimated to be between 3,000 and 4,000 years old. This, according to the researchers, suggests that the latest fossils are probably of a similar age. Professor Rosenberger said that the bones showed hardly any sign of post-death damage like the kind that comes from being eaten by a predator. Instead, he said it appeared that many of the lemurs had decomposed slowly and their bones have not been disturbed since. Scientists have described the apparent graveyard of fossilised giant lemur as a 'remarkable discovery' The scientists believe there could be hundreds it not thousands of individual animals buried in the silt . Among the other animal fossils found resting on the silt surface were this skull from a horned crocodile . Divers discovered found the fossils sitting on the silt covered floor as they explored three large caves . It has raised intriguing questions about what led all these animals to die in one place. One theory is that it was a sort of graveyard where the animals went to die, or the cave had once been an ecosystem that flooded, killing whatever was inside the cave. In Mitoho cave, the researchers found evidence that it had once been the den of an extinct carnivore known as the giant fossa, Cyrptoprocta spelea. The caves sit within Tsimanampesotse National Park and are thought to have flooded with sea water . Hundreds of fossils were found on top of the cave floor, like above, but many more could be buried in the silt . The scientists believe the graveyard, above, is the largest concentration of giant lemur fossils ever found . This greater bamboo lemur pictured above is one of the most endangered primates in the world, with their population though to number just 500 . They are some of the world’s most-loved animals, but almost 95 per cent of lemurs are threatened with extinction, according to the latest global assessment of at-risk species. Madagascar is the only place on the planet where they are found in the wild, making them one of the most threatened groups of animals on Earth. Of the African island nation’s 101 remaining lemur species, more than a fifth are critically endangered, including the largest living lemur, the large-bodied Indri. Almost half of the species are endangered, including the world’s smallest primate, Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur and 20 are vulnerable to extinction. Lemurs are threatened by destruction of tropical forest habitat, with illegal logging on the increase in the face of political uncertainty and rising poverty in Madagascar, where some people hunt them for food. This would explain some of the bones that had appeared there. The researchers also found fossilised bats, rodents and other carnivores in the caves. But according to Professor Rosenberger, it is the extent of the lemur fossils that makes the caves truly extraordinary. They vary in size from those similar to the species found in Madagascar today - the only place in the world where lemurs survive - to the giant Megaladapis edwardsi, which weighed up to 165lbs. But unlike their primate cousins, these giant lemur were thought to behave more like koala bears, clinging to trees. Many of the fossilised lemurs discovered in the caves were much larger than species that are alive today . Few bones, like those above, showed signs of disturbance after death, suggesting the lemurs were not eaten . This diagram shows how the structure of the Aven caves where most of the lemur bones were found . Professor Rosenberger said they found a skull of one of these creatures in the Malaza Manga cave. He said: 'One of the nicest things we discovered is a very beautiful skull sitting on the silty surface at the bottom of the cave of an animal called Megaladapis. 'It is a fascinating critter. It is kind of like a koala bear lemur. 'It had a large cow-like skull of about one foot in length, enormous molar teeth - perhaps twice as large as to be expected for body weight - designed to leafy shear food, and a stocky body with fairly short limbs. The largest lemur skull found in the caves belonged to a giant lemur called Megaladapis, which is weighed as much as a female gorilla but lived in the trees, clinging to branches much like Koalas do in Australia . Professors Rosenberger (right) and Godfrey (left) say they are just beginning of their work on the fossils . 'It had no upper incisor teeth, which is an adaptation we find in mammals that crop leaves with flappy big lips.' The researchers hope that by understanding more about what led to the demise of these species it might help them predict what will happen to the existing ones in the future. Professor Laurie Godfrey, a palaeontologist at the University of Massachusetts, said: 'When you have a place that two thirds of the animals that lived there only a thousand years ago are gone and replaced by other animals, then what we need to know is what are the implications for the rest of the flora and fauna.' The lemur remains appear to have decomposed and were undisturbed for hundreds if not thousands of years .","Divers discovered the fossils in caves in Tsimanampesotse, Madagascar .

"Jeb Bush's wife Columba (pictured) has expensive taste when it comes to jewelry - taking out loans to buy $90,000 worth of jewelry over a 14-year period . Potential Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush's  wife Columba has very expensive taste when it comes to jewelry - taking out loans to buy $90,000 worth of jewelry over a 14-year period. State filings show Columba Bush, 61, the  wife of the former Florida Governor, owns several Rolex watches and a pair of $25,000 diamond earrings. In 1999 she was fined for misrepresenting the amount of clothing and jewelry she had bought while on a shopping trip in Paris by federal customs officials. Husband Jeb Bush, 62, said at the time she misled customs because she did not want him to know that she had spent $19,000 on the trip. But less than a year later she took out a loan to buy $42,311.70 worth of jewelry on a single day, according to records filed with the state of Florida by Mayors Jewelers, and seen by the Washington Post. Mrs Bush took out the loans to buy tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry  from the South Florida store over a 14-year period. Documents available online shows that she spent a total of more than $90,000 at the store. Uniform Commercial Code forms filed by the store with the Florida secretary of state's office on May 3, 2000, indicate that Mayors arranged a loan under which Columba Bush bought four items. They were a $25,600 pair of diamond stud earrings set in platinum; a $10,500 18-karat white-gold and diamond bracelet by  Bulgari; an 18-karat white-gold and diamond necklace, which cost $3,200; and another pair of diamond earrings, for $3,300. The paper reports that this was one of at least five such loans made by the store to Columba Bush between 1995 and 2009. In 1997 she bought a Roman coin necklace for $15,000 and a $16,600 Rolex watch studded with diamonds. The most recent loan was to pay for an $11,700 Rolex watch and a $5,900 pair of earrings. Jeb Bush and wife Columba (pictured). In 1999 she was fined for misrepresenting the amount of clothing and jewelry she had bought while on a shopping trip in Paris by federal customs officials . Jeb Bush's political team insisted that her tastes and shopping habits are not an issue. 'Mrs. Bush bought jewelry from time to time from Mayors Jewelers over the years,' Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told the Washington Post. 'Though not required to be reported, these purchases in 2000 were included as accounts payable on Governor Bush's financial disclosure that year, and paid off the next.' Campbell also said that the governor was 'aware she made purchases from time to time.' Mayors spokesman Francis Guindon declined to comment and said the store keeps its clients' information confidential. If her husband successfully runs for president, Mrs Bush would be the third Mrs Bush in the White House - but she would also be the first Hispanic first lady, and only the second first lady born outside of the United States. She has kept herself out of the limelight since he announced his plan to run, as she has throughout his political career. Columba and Jeb Bush at the John F.

"The omission of Joan Rivers from the In Memoriam segment of Sunday night’s Oscars caused uproar among fans on social media within moments of the segment being aired. Although Joan wasn’t an Oscar-winning actress or filmmaker, she was unquestionably an influential woman in Academy Awards history. The 81-year-old actress, comedian, and TV host died suddenly on September 4 from complications during surgery. Scroll down for video . Snub: Comedian and TV host Joan Rivers was left out of the 2015 Academy Awards In Memoriam segment . Joan Rivers' acting roles included voicing the gold robot Dot Matrix in 1987's Spaceballs, while Elaine Stritch, right, was another showbiz legend missing from the In Memoriam segment . The next say the Academy responded. 'Joan Rivers is among the many worthy artists and filmmakers we were unfortunately unable to feature in the In Memoriam segment of this year’s Oscar show,' a rep for the Academy told The Hollywood Reporter. 'She is, however, included in our In Memoriam gallery on Oscar.com.' According to a Monday post from TMZ, daughter Melissa isn't too happy. 'She feels her mom deserved a place in the In Memoriam portion of the Oscars, but she's not going to focus on the snub,' a source told the site. While Joan's movie career wasn't of the type usually honoured by the Oscars - she tended to show up mostly in comedic cameos in movies including The Muppets Take Manhattan, Spaceballs, and The Smurfs - her mark on the ceremony itself was huge. Joan began hosting the E! network's pre-Academy Awards red carpet with daughter Melissa Rivers in 1995, a job she continued through 2014. Other snubs included Taylor Negron, left in The Last Boy Scout, and SNL alum Jan Hooks, right as Hillary Clinton . According to Vanity Fair, the Rivers women 'revolutionized the red carpet - from a runway with little celebrity-reporter interaction - into its own brand of entertainment.' She also wrote and directed 1978's Rabbit Test, while Maya Angelou was included despite only directing one film (1998's Down in the Delta). Joan's omission from the tribute section of the Academy Awards immediately stirred up a passionate reaction on Twitter. 'No Joan Rivers? Tacky to say the least,' tweeted Ryan Parker. Tacky: Fans quickly took to Twitter to protest the 'tacky' omission of Joan . Colleagues: Sally Jessy Raphael, a TV-host colleague of Joan's, tweeted quickly in indignation . Anger: Some Twitter users grew angry about the snub . Jokes: In Joan's style, some protested with the use of humour . Missing: From the beginning of the show, some missed Joan's signature style on the red carpet . Talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael chimed in as well: 'No mention of @Joan_Rivers in the Memorial?! That's not right.' '#Oscars feels wrong w/out #JoanRivers. Bummed the Academy didn't include the red carpet queen during the In Memoriam,' wrote Matt Whitfield. Some fans on social media at least found a little dark comedy in the situation. 'Joan Rivers is gonna surprise us after the commercial break by being alive, I guess,' wrote Shalyah Evans. Complaints about In Memoriam snubs have been around just about as long as the segment itself and Joan wasn’t the only surprising snub in the 2015 version. Introduction: Frequent Oscar nominee Meryl Streep introduced the always sad segment . Tributes: While Joan was left out, film-making luminaries like Robin Williams, Malik Bendjelloul, Ruby Dee, and more were mentioned . Broadway legend and comedienne Elaine Stritch had appeared in films including A Farewell To Arms and Monster-In-Law. Taylor Negron had been a character actor of some note with memorable roles in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Last Boy Scout. Another missing name was Jan Hooks, an SNL alum who appeared in Batman Returns, Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Coneheads. Others on social media complained that writer-director-actor Harold Ramis had also been left out, but the Ghostbusters - who star passed away in early 2014 – had been included in last year's Oscars ceremony. Those who were mentioned in the tribute, introduced by Meryl Streep, included Robin Williams, Mike Nichols, Mickey Rooney, Lauren Bacall, James Garner, Ruby Dee, Luise Rainer and Maya Angelou. After the photo tributes finished, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson sang. Music: After the memorial pictures were shown, Jennifer Hudson performed .","Comedian Rivers was a surprising omission from Sunday night's tribute to those no longer with us .

"The holiday of the future will still provide memories of strolls along sunny beaches, the sensation of sand between your toes and the peaceful rush of the ocean, but there will be one crucial difference. You won't have ever actually been away - in fact you might not have even left your home. Instead, people will download memories to their brains to make them feel as if they have been on a sun-kissed holiday. That’s just one of the many realities we could face as we learn to manipulate the human mind, US physicist Dr Michio Kaku told MailOnline in an exclusive interview. Visionary: Dr Kaku is best known for his expertise in theoretical physics but his latest book takes a look at how rapid advancements could bring about huge changes in how we understand – and use – our brains . Dr Kaku is best known for his expertise in theoretical physics – his previous books have dealt with topics such as parallel universes and the cosmos. But his latest book, The Future of the Mind, takes a look at how rapid advancements could bring about huge changes in how we understand – and use – our brains in the next 50 to 100 years. His theories on the future of the mind are wide-ranging, from the possibilities of telepathy to controlling ‘programmable matter’ with our thoughts alone. At times, his opinions sound purely like science fiction – but he’s convinced that these are developments we’ll see not just in the distant future, but by the end of the century. Of particular interest is the ability to implant memories. ‘First of all, someone goes on vacation before you, and pleasant memories such as walking on the seashore and picking up rocks are put on a disc,’ Dr Kaku told MailOnline. ‘Then they're uploaded into your own mind; relax, and there you are at the beach. ‘Feel the wind at your face, hear the sound of the waves, all the sensations – you’ll have a memory of a very nice walk on the beach in some exotic location, that’s what this person before you felt. ‘These things are within the realms of possibility – it’s only a matter of time.’ Wish you were here? In the future we may never set foot on a tropical beach when we go one holiday, we could just visit them virtually through downloads we place inside our brain, Dr Kaku says . All this will be made possible by significant advancements in our understanding of the brain. As Dr Kaku points out, we have learned more about the brain in the last 15 years than we have in the rest of human history. And crucially, our knowledge of the map of neural connections in the brain, known as the connectome, is rapidly improving. This is thanks to machines such as MRI scanners that can see which parts of the brain light up as a person performs different activities. ‘In the short term, we’re going to be able to connect our minds to computers, so that we’ll be able to control exoskeletons,’ he said. Dr Kaku was born in California on 24 January 1947. He led a distinguished academic career, attending Harvard University and the University of California, Berkely – where he received his PhD in 1972. His studies focused on theoretical physics, and he is continuing to search for a so-called 'Theory of Everything' that unites the four fundamental forces of nature – the strong force, the weak force, gravity and electromagnetism. Today he popularises physics to the public and has appeared on numerous TV and radio programmes. He has also written various popular science books including Physics of the Future and Beyond Einstein: The Cosmic Quest for the Theory of the Universe. His latest book, The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind, was number one on the New York Times Bestseller list. ‘We’ll be able to perform primitive forms of telepathy, we’ll eventually record memories, and then Alzheimer's patients will be able to push a button and memories will flood in. ‘Beyond that, the Internet will be replaced by the “Brain-net”, where you can convey emotions and memories rather than just text.’ Further into the future, probably the 22nd century, we could control surrogate robots on alien worlds with our minds, so we can explore space without physically having to go anywhere, according to Dr Kaku. ‘Maybe aliens have already done this, and we’re walking into the middle of an interstellar system where people commute regularly to planets and stars, and we’re too stupid to know it,’ he said. On telepathy, Dr Kaku says we can already take someone who’s totally paralysed, hook them up to a computer, and allow them to send messages on the internet. In the future, you could ‘walk into a room, mentally turn on the lights, internet, answer emails, call up for a movie. Indeed the computer mouse will gradually be phased out. This will be made possible thanks to programmable matter – the dream of creating tiny little dust particles with the power of a PC, known as catoms, that can change their electric charge and be rearranged – all by our minds. At the moment we are ‘nowhere near getting down to a grain of sand,’ but Dr Kaku insists this can be addressed in the future. ‘In principle, in the future – mid-century – when you walk into a room, you’ll mentally control all computers which are invisible – like Harry Potter. ‘What he does with his wand is rearrange matter so one object turns into another. ‘That’s the goal of programmable matter, to have the ability like a magician.By late in this century, we might have full power.’ Dr Kaku's theories on the future of the mind are wide-ranging, from the possibilities of telepathy to controlling ‘programmable matter’ with our thoughts alone (artist's impression of neuron, pictured) He added: ‘Someone from the outside watching us would think we’re sorcerers.’ Advancements in brain manipulation have important moral implications in the future, too, according to Dr Kaku. ‘[You could] fire a gun and record that, and insert it into an innocent person’s brain so he thinks he fired a gun when he didn’t.’ Dr Kaku says it will be entirely possible that we will one day be able to upload entire skills into a person's brain. To become a doctor, for instance, someone could have all the relevant medical terminology and procedures uploaded into their mind. However, he does not think this will make education obsolete, as people will still need to learn how to use this information. 'If you want to be a great chess player, learning the moves of chess is not enough,' he said. 'You have to chew on it, you have to regurgitate games of the past. 'In the future, you'll be able to learn the basic rules of calculus, but if you think “what does it mean” and “how can I apply this in new situations”, then you have to chew on it, and that you have to do yourself.' Innocent people can be fooled into believing they have carried out a violent crime that never took place, a study has revealed. Psychologists found that during just three hours of interviews, adults could be convinced they had perpetrated a theft, an assault, or even attacked somebody with a weapon when they were a teenager. People can be fooled into believing they have carried out a violent crime that never took place . Using suggestive memory-retrieval techniques, the researchers were able to trick 70 per cent of the participants into believing they had committed an offence. The effect was so strong that the participants ended up providing detailed descriptions of things that had never actually taken place . ‘Our findings show that false memories of committing crime with police contact can be surprisingly easy to generate, and can have all the same kinds of complex details as real memories,' said lead researcher Julia Shaw, from the University of Bedfordshire. ‘All participants need to generate a richly detailed false memory is three hours in a friendly interview environment, where the interviewer introduces a few wrong details and uses poor memory-retrieval techniques.’ After hearing a false account of their teenage crime - peppered with true details of their life at that time - the participants appeared to ‘internalise’ the fabricated story. This highlights the fundamental malleability of memory, said Dr Shaw. ‘This research speaks to the distinct possibility that most of us are likely able to generate rich false memories of emotional and criminal events,’ she said. But if all of this sounds a bit daunting, Dr Kaku we may be able to look for guidance not on Earth – but in the discovery of intelligent races elsewhere in the cosmos who 'mentally communicate' with each other. 'Some of my friends who listen for messages think [first contact] will happen in the next few decades,' he said. Although Dr Kaku thinks that estimate is a bit soon, he said it was possible that if contact is made, a race could be an 'alien consciousness' rather than a physical being like humans, and he does not necessarily think they will be dangerous. That itself brings a suggestion that they may be more like the 'Borg in Star Trek', where people are all linked to a single consciousness. He said such a future for humanity was 'not impossible', and ultimately the 'ability to liberate ourselves from the inconveniences of the human body' would allow us to explore space like never before. Until, then, we'll have to make do with downloadable holidays, programmable matter and learning new skills at the touch of a button.","US physicist Dr Michio Kaku was speaking exclusively to MailOnline .

"She had just landed a Best Actress Oscar her performance in Still Alice. And the first person Julianne Moore wanted to see was a 50-year-old former nurse in Minnesota. Mother-of-two Sandy Oltz was the inspiration for the role which tells the story of a high-flying woman diagnosed with Alzheimer's at just 50 years old. As soon as she finished partying, Moore sent a text that Oltz shared exclusively with Daily Mail Online, which said: 'Thank you thank you very very much for EVERYTHING. Love you so much. Julie.' Scroll down for video . Inspiration: Julianne Moore grins next to Sandy Oltz, the woman who inspired her role in Still Alice . Oscar-winning: Moore won the Best Actress Oscar on Sunday night for her portrayal in the movie (left) The pair met for the first time over Skype a year and a half ago. They are now close friends, and Oltz even celebrated her 50th birthday on set. Oltz, of Sartell, Minnesota, told Daily Mail Online: 'I screamed so much when Julie won the Oscar, I woke up my sons, my husband and my dog. 'I was sat on the sofa in my jammies so nervous for her. When it came to the Best Actress award I got up so I was inches away from the screen. 'They called her name and I was jumping around like a fool.' It was the culmination of months tirelessly juggling her own every day struggles with consulting on a major Hollywood movie. Still Alice, adapted from Lisa Genova's hit 2007 novel, tackles the growing issue of early on-set Alzheimer's in women. Oltz, 50, who is married with two teenage boys, was 46 years old with a high-pressured job as a nurse and caregiver when she started misplacing things, forgetting to turn off the oven, and struggling for words. After a year of tests for a brain tumor, strokes, and even menopause, her doctor diagnosed Oltz with Alzheimer's. In Still Alice, Moore plays Alice Howland, a 50-year-old linguistics professor with three successful adult children who starts fumbling her words during lectures. Diagnosed with the disease, she then faces a battle to find a way to retain elements of herself and cope with the prospect that she will die within 10 years. On set: Oltz and Moore on the set of Still Alice with a cake for Oltz's 50th birthday last year . Journey: Oltz said it has taken her years to understand her  identity after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's . Mirror image: Oltz said she was amazed at how many of her own characteristics Moore adopted in the movie . Telling her story: Like Moore's character in the movie, Oltz has sons who are having to come to terms with it . To inform her performance, which won her an Oscar, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award - to name a few - Moore turned to Oltz for whom this story is a reality. When Oltz saw the premiere, she says, it was uncanny. 'I don't know what I expected but when I saw it I was like ""that's me in that movie!""' Oltz told Daily Mail Online. 'I didn't realize she'd picked up even little things about the way I act. 'I was so impressed by her throughout the process of the film. 'She asked me questions and I tried to answer them but when I saw the film I was amazed. She really listened to me and watched me. 'She brought the Alzheimer's disease experience to life with Alice.' A pivotal scene in the movie is Moore's speech to an Alzheimer's conference about her condition - which uses the same words Oltz wrote when she gave her first speech as an Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisor, which is now her full-time job. Moore also used a highlighter during the speech to stay focused, which is something Oltz does all the time. And in the movie poster, Moore is clutching the medical bracelet around her wrist, which Oltz had told her was an incredibly difficult thing to accept. Describing the creative process, Oltz said: 'Our first conversation was so nice because we just clicked. We talked about Alzheimer's but first we just talked about life and everything that we enjoyed. 'Then later she got on to questions like, ""What does it feel like to have Alzheimer's?'' 'I would say, ""Well, it's like all these words [are here] and you can't find the right one."" 'After people talk to me, they start to notice I stammer on words. 'Every day you work so hard, you're just exhausted by the end of the day.' The movie also explores how the character comes to terms with her identity. Alice prides herself on her intelligence and struggles to accept that she may have to relinquish that quality. Working with the Alzheimer's Association: The crew (Kristen Stewart, second left, Moore, center left, producer Maria Shriver, center right, and co-producer Pam Koffler) posed with Oltz (between Moore and Stewart) and other members of the Association to promote awareness of the disease . A new purpose: Oltz is now an Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisor and campaigns for support . She gives talks, like the character Alice does in the movie, and tries to help people deal with the same thing . It is an endeavor Oltz recognizes. 'My whole life has been identified by my professional work, which I can't do anymore. 'I was always Sandy the nurse, Sandy at the hospital, Sandy the caretaker. And that was stripped away as soon as I was diagnosed and it's no longer my identity. 'It took a long time to re-identify myself and to work out, who am I? What am I contributing to society? The Alzheimer's Society has really helped me redirect myself by offering me a job as a coordinator.' She also fears her teenage sons will not remember what she was like. 'I worry they're never going to know how smart I really was,' she told ABC. 'They see their mom as kind of funny because I have to be.' Oltz gave the movie '10 out of 10' and grew a strong bond with 'Julie', who she says gave a stellar performance. For her children, it was not as clear cut. 'They liked it and they didn't like it,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'Alice is much further along than I am and I think that was very eye-opening for them, and quite upsetting. 'But they enjoyed the performance and many parts of the film. 'For me, as someone who is on the same journey, all of the awards an accolades that have come to Julianne for her performance, including the Oscar, are so well deserved and so important to all of us with Alzheimer's disease.'","Mother-of-two Sandy Oltz was 46 when she was diagnosed with disease .

"A Stony Brook  University student says she was forced to personally prosecute the man she claims sexually assaulted her. Now Sarah Tubbs, 22, is suing the school as well as her alleged attacker for Title XI violations, which prevent discrimination of gender at federally funded schools. Stony Brook is part of the State University of New York system. Filed last month in White Plains federal court, Tubbs' suit seeks monetary damages and a court order dissolving the school's practice of requiring sexual assault victims to 'prosecute their won cases and to cross-examine and be cross-examined by their assailants.' Sarah Tubbs, 22, is suing Stony Brook as well as her alleged attacker for Title XI violations, which prevent discrimination of gender at federally funded schools . Which, as The Journal News reports, is exactly what she Tubbs says happened to her. Tubbs says the attack happened early on January 26, 2014, after a drinking game at a campus party. She went with the unnamed attacker to his dorm with the intention of having sex, but changed her mind. She tired to physically resist and blacked out from the intoxication. Her assailant then forced oral sex on her, penetrated her with his digits, and tried to have vaginal intercourse. As the alleged assailant has not been criminally charged his name has not been released, and he failed to respond to interview request from The Journal News. 'I froze and there were parts of the night where I couldn't fight because it's not an option,' Tubbs said. She reported the assault to campus police two days later. They directed her to have a rape examination at Stony Brooky University Hospital. Two weeks later with the exam done, she filed a formal complaint, but the officer told her that her case wasn't viable 'because she did not scream 'No' or violently fight back.' She did not go to the District Attorney, fearing they'd tell her the same thing. But she did go after university disciplinary action only to be told one week before the hearing that she would have to be the one to prosecute her alleged attacker. That meant making exhibits, penning and opening statement, and putting together witness testimony. Tubbs said the school's campus police told her she didn't have a case as she failed to say 'no' or 'violently fight back' She spent the five-hour hearing separated from her alleged attacker by nothing but a paper screen, without any form of security present. 'I would say the hardest part was hearing his voice because it's the voice I hear in my flashbacks,' she said. 'One of my biggest concerns ... was that he would get aggressive and retaliate.' The accused claimed everything was consensual and was found not to be responsible for any wrongdoing. She appealed based on the Stony Brook's sexual misconduct policy being clear that a person cannot give consent if impaired by alcohol or unconscious. Stony Brook is just one of 94 colleges nationally with pending Title IX investigations regarding sexual violence. Tubbs has since graduated and now studies for a master's in social work at Hunter College. 'I don't think it's the rape that makes the person a victim,' she said. 'I think it's the systemic failure that makes someone from a survivor to a victim. ... I can honestly say I won't stop fighting until those systems change.'","Sarah Tubbs, 22, is suing Stony Brook as well as her alleged attacker for Title XI violations .

"Conjoined twins who were connected at the chest and abdomen have been separated after an operation that has never before been successfully attempted. Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata were born in Texas last April and were welcomed by parents Elysse and John Eric. The couple, from Lubbock, were told that their twin girls would be conjoined and when they were born it was found their shared the same chest wall, lungs, pericardial sac (the lining of the heart), diaphragm, liver, intestines, colon and pelvis. Scroll down for video . Mother Elysse Mata goes to see one of her daughters in recovery and gives the thumbs up after her conjoined twins were successfully separated . Doctors and family members gather around the other girl as she recovers from surgery. The operation to separate them lasted a total of 26 hours . The twins, pictures before the surgery were connected at the chest and abdomen and shared several vital organs including the liver, lungs and intestines . Earlier this month, a team of more than 26 clinicians, including 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses at the Texas Children's Hospital operated to separate the 10-month-olds. The 26-hour surgery was the first time twins conjoined at the chest and abdomen in this way had been separated successfully. And now their mother Elysse says she can't thank the surgeons enough for giving her daughters the chance to live separate lives. She said: 'We know how much planning and time went into this surgery and we are so blessed to be at a place like Texas Children's where we have access to the surgeons and caretakers that have made this dream a reality. The girls' father John Eric struggles contain his emotion after both of his daughters survived the operation, which had never before been attempted . Mrs Mata strokes one of her daughter's hair after the surgery earlier this month. Both girls are still recovering in Texas Children's Hospital's intensive care unit . Mrs Mata struggles to hold back her tears of happiness, saying she can't thank the surgeons enough for allowing her daughters to live separate lives . Mr and Mrs Mata personally thank some of the medical team that operated on their daughters. In total 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses carried out the surgery . 'We also want to express our gratitude to all of the people that have prayed and provided support to our family over the last 10 months. To prepare for the major surgery earlier this month, both Knatalye and Adeline underwent a five hour procedure in December to place custom-made tissue expanders into their chest and abdomen. The tissue expanders helped to stretch the babies’ skin in preparation for their separation surgery. Models of their organs were also created so doctors could carry out simulations of the operation before the actual surgery. During the operation, the team worked for around 23 hours on Knatalye and for 26 on Adeline with the official separation taking place 18 hours into the procedure. Mrs Mata discovered she was carrying conjoined twins when a routine ultra-sound showed that the girls were connected at the chest and abdomen .

Dr Darrell Cass, paediatric surgeon said: 'This is the first time a separation surgery for thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus twins with this particular configuration has been successful. 'This surgery was not without its challenges with the girls sharing several organ systems. 'Our team has been preparing for this surgery for months and we’ve done everything from working with our radiology experts to build a 3-D model of their organs, to conducting simulations of the actual separation surgery.' The girls are now being cared for in the hospital's paediatric intensive care unit, where they will recover for the next couple of months. There is no date for their release from hospital as it is thought they will have to undergo additional procedures in the future.","Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata, aged 10 months, were born last year connected by the chest and abdomen .

"David Cameron’s failure to take military action against Syria may have cost Britain a £6billion deal to sell fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates, experts claimed last night. The Prime Minister faced a massive snub when the oil-rich Gulf state suddenly pulled the plug on plans to buy 60 Eurofighter Typhoons from defence giant BAe Systems on Thursday. Following a year of talks, the aerospace firm admitted the UAE had ‘elected not to proceed’ on the purchase of a range of defence and security equipment. No deal: David Cameron flew out to the UAE to convince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to go ahead with a deal with BAe, but did not succeed . The decision was a blow for Mr Cameron, who flew to Dubai last month to persuade crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to buy the warplanes, which are also in service with the RAF. Defence analysts said the Government had paid the price for failing to be ‘robust’ over Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, who killed more than 1,400 civilians in a chemical weapon attack in a bid to crush pro-democracy rebels. In August, Mr Cameron suffered a humiliating Commons defeat over plans for missile strikes on Syria - seen as a grave threat to Middle East stability. But inaction by Downing Street over Damascus - and Iran’s nuclear ambitions - fuelled concerns in the Gulf about the UK’s long-term commitment to the region’s stability. Dr John Louth, of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said: ‘Britain didn’t really do a great deal in relation to Syria and this may have undermined [the UAE’s] confidence. But Dr Louth suggested the lucrative contract might not be ‘dead in the water’ because the UAE still needed fighter jets. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a deal on this in the next year,’ he added. However, Keith Hayward, of the Royal Aeronautical Society, said: ‘All sorts of things can affect these deals and not just to do with the quality of the aircraft concerned.’ UAE military chiefs are said to prefer the Typhoon following its performance in Libya during the 2011 campaign to oust Colonel Gaddafi. Abandoned: The Eurofighter, pictured, will no longer be bought by the UAE . The decision to axe the deal was a blow to BAe Systems, which has been increasingly eyeing overseas sales to offset declining Ministry of Defence budgets. It raised fears that the firm, which makes the aircraft in collaboration with European group EADS and Italy’s Finmeccanica, could be beaten to the contract by France’s Dassault Aviation, manufacturer of the rival Rafale fighter. Last year the aerospace manufacturer lost out to Dassault to supply 126 jets to India – although the final negotiations were marred by bribery accusations when a manager was accused of paying about £250 to an official for providing a better site to exhibit its products at an air show. The French also have an airbase near Abu Dhabi and the UAE has an existing fleet of French-built Mirage 2000-9 warplanes. The Rafale fighter is cheaper than the Typhoon but is considered not as capable. Howard Wheeldon, an independent defence analyst, said the French are not ‘in this race’. ‘This is a campaign that has not been lost but it has not been won. Nobody else has won this deal – it has essentially gone away,’ he said. A Number 10 source said the deal was ‘always going to be a tricky one’ because the UAE has been in talks with France for a long time and the Typhoon entered the process quite late in the process. A government spokesman added: ‘It was always going to be a difficult deal to do. And as BAe have said, it was an exciting prospect but not part of their business plan.’ BAe assembles Typhoons for the RAF and for Saudi Arabia at its plant in Warton, Lancashire, where it employs more than 5,000 workers.","Experts claim lack of military intervention could have scuppered deal .

"He usually keeps his Oscars work backstage. But a Matt Damon lookalike accountant saw his experience at the Academy Awards take a very public turn Sunday night - after he was dragged onstage and ribbed by host Neil Patrick Harris. Brian Cullinan, a boss at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), is one of just two people trusted with the secret of who has won the coveted awards before the results are announced to the world, which he stashes away in a locked briefcase. 'Has anyone ever told you?' Neil Patrick Harris brought Brian Cullinan on-stage to point out that he looks like Matt Damon . Laughing it off: The red-faced accountant didn't have a ready reply for Harris's ribbing . This year, however, he was given an extra job - to guard the key to a second briefcase containing Harris's predictions for how the 87th Academy Awards would play out. After the gongs had been awarded, Cullinan was brought out by Harris, who grilled him on his job as guardian of the Oscars secrets. It was then he dropped the surprise line: 'Anyone ever tell you, you look just like Matt Damon?', seizing on the uncanny resemblance. Before he could answer, Harris had swept away with the key to unveil his secret box, leaving Cullinan to make his way off the stage. This Oscars was Cullinan's second as one of PwC's twin gatekeepers of the academy's secrets. Spot the difference: Cullinan's likeness to Matt Damon (right) was seized upon by the Oscars host . Secret keepers: PricewaterhouseCoopers use this briefcase to store the top-secret winners' names . Along with newly-appointed Martha Ruiz, he oversees the process by which some 6,000 voters' choices are assembled and counted. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the stacks of votes for each category are split into smaller piles and doled out to PwC staffers. They then tally up the votes in their pile - but don't know the winners as they haven't seen all the votes. Their results are then passed on to Cullinan and Ruiz, who calculate the final total and commit the winners' list to memory. Later, they make two identical briefcases filled with the winning envelopes, which are locked and kept under armed guard until the night itself, a process which has been refined over the 81 years PwC has been in charged of the process. However, seizing the spotlight, for however short a time, was never part of the playbook.","Neil Patrick Harris made jibe at PwC bigwig Brian Cullinan at ceremony .

"A teenage model tried to kill herself after a bully from her sixth-form college threw a cup of bleach in her face at a house party. Victoria Smith, 17, has been trolled online ever since she was attacked by Rebecca Morris, who thought that she was responsible for getting her expelled from college. The victim, who models under the name 'Toria Melody', was temporarily blinded by the assault and has since become depressed and is forced to wear a wig. Attack: Rebecca Morris, left, threw bleach in the face of aspiring model Victoria Smith, right, at a party . Morris, 18, appeared at Hull Crown Court for a sentencing hearing today, and was told she is likely to face jail over the attack in August last year. The court heard that Morris had invited Miss Smith to a party in Hull in a bid to take revenge after she was expelled from Wilberforce Sixth Form College, where the two girls both used to study. As Miss Smith tried to leave the gathering Morris followed her and threw bleach in her face, shouting: 'There is your shot of bleach instead of your shot of vodka. That is for getting me kicked out of college.' The victim got bleach in her eyes, causing 'excruciating pain' which could have been worse if a friend had not quickly poured Coke in her face to reduce the burning. Last month, Morris pleaded guilty to unlawfully and maliciously casting or throwing a corrosive fluid, with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable or to do some grievous bodily harm. Torment: Miss Smith, pictured, who models under the name Toria Melody, suffered burns across her body . Today the court was read a victim impact statement from Miss Smith, in which the aspiring model told of the agony she had suffered since the attack. Stephen Welch, prosecuting, said: 'She felt scared and frightened and she thought she would never see again. She was left temporarily blind for a moment and says the attack caused her a lot of pain and suffering. 'She said her eyes continue to be blurry and she has the vision at six metres a normal person would have at nine metres. 'Her eyes continue to be dry and her hair was damaged. It immediately went green and began to fall out. It went streaky and continued to fall out. She now wears a wig.' Miss Smith has refused to return to college, stopped modelling and given up her dreams of attending university since the attack, the court heard. School row: The two girls were both pupils at Wilberforce Sixth Form College in Hull, pictured . 'She says she is a prisoner in her own room,' Mr Welch said. 'She is scared of other people also attacking her. She says she continues to face bullying from friends of Rebecca Morris. 'She says she has received messages on Facebook calling her an attention seeker and laughing about her hair, calling her fat and saying what they want to do to her. 'She used to be a model before the attack but now says she cannot model anymore. She has lost her confidence. She believes that everyone hates her and she no longer wants to be here anymore. 'A month after the attack Miss Smith was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary after taking an overdose. She says she still feels suicidal and does not know how to cope.' Miss Smith is now suffering from depression and sees a psychiatrist once or twice a week, the barrister added. The victim said in a previous hearing that she was bullied for seven years all through school, and was only starting to regain her confidence at the time of the bleach assault. Judge David Tremberg will sentence Morris next Monday. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.","Rebecca Morris accused Victoria Smith of getting her expelled from college .

"A man who went on television to tell of his 'neighbours from hell' has had his house ransacked and the word 'dead' scrawled on his living room wall. Robert Crowley appeared on Channel 5's 'Extreme Nightmare Neighbours Next Door' last year and told of a series of clashes with a fellow resident of Bow, Devon. Mr Crowley has now gone to police after he found his home doused in a flammable liquid and red paint daubed on his walls. Scroll down for video . Robert Cowley came home this weekend to find his house ransacked and soaked in flammable liquid . The 61-year-old came home earlier this month to find his cottage had been broken into and a thick liquid had been poured over his carpets and floors of his kitchen and living room. The word 'dead' has been painted over the father-of-one's living room wall, leaving Mr Crowley in fear for his life. After a previous break in, Mr Crowley had installed CCTV at his home, but the devices' wires had been cut, meaning he did not have footage of the incident. He said: 'All of my kit has been ruined and I don't have contents insurance. I've been down on my finances, so I cancelled it in December to save money.' But the former electrician, who has battled cancer, has said he has already 'stared death in the face' and so is trying to remain positive. He added: 'The fact they didn't burn the house down shows they must have some degree of what is right and what is wrong.' The word 'dead' had been scrawled on Mr Crowley's living room wall in red lettering during the break-in . Mr Crowley has suffered numerous attacks since moving to the village in 2010. Arrests were made following a previous campaign of abuse which later resulted in several convictions for criminal damage. Mr Crowley had to fit security bars to his windows and install security cameras just to feel safe in his own home. 'I feel other neighbours have shunned me,' he said, 'but I will never be forced from my home.' Detective Sergeant Gus Cottey said: 'We will always act on information passed to us to support the community and the area where we live.' 'To all members of the public I would appeal for people to come forward if you have lived in Bow and have had any harassment, report it to the police.'

"A local council has been left red-faced after photographs surfaced of a woeful attempt at drawing line markings on a Brisbane road. In the photo posted on social media by a resident of the Moreton Bay Regional Council (MBRC) area shows a white line marking painted over the top of a pile of leaves and bark. The picture was snapped on Mount Nebo Road, which is located north-west of Brisbane, Westside News reported. The botched line job was sighted along Mt Nebo Road, which is north-west of Brisbane in Queensland . Along with it, the resident wrote a caption that said: 'Nice one MBRC'. The post immediately garnered a response from local councillor Bob Millar. The Division 11 representative, whose ward covers the Mount Nebo region, said he was sitting with the director of engineering construction and maintenance whose response Cr Millar would not repeat. He explained the council hired a contractor to do the line markings and director Tony Martini was speaking with the contractor who completed the job as he wrote. In photos, it appears the contractor painted line markings over the top of leaves and bark on the road . Cr Millar said the first reaction he had when he saw the photo was 'Well that's interesting'. 'The section of road, over which approximately five metres of roadside vegetation litter was ""painted"" ,was part of a 15-kilometre line marking project being undertaken during the off-peak night time,' he told Daily Mail Australia. He also told Quest Newspapers 'it’s not beyond the bounds of possibility that in the darkness the operator for the company contracted to council has missed it'. The company would now redo the botched job after the matter was raised with the contractor by the council's project manager. 'I was disappointed, the director was disappointed, the project manager was disappointed and so was the owner of the contractor,' Cr Millar said.

"A map of the riskiest destinations for contracting an illness or being involved in an accident has been published by health organisation International SOS. The Health Risk Map 2015 ranks destinations in five categories, in order to help companies and travellers understand the risks they face in different countries when getting medical treatment. Categories include low risk, medium risk, high risk and extreme risk, with another category for large, rapidly developing countries. The International SOS Health Risk map shows the countries where healthcare is high quality and the places where travellers are at risk . While Europe, North America and Australia are understandably among the countries offering the highest levels of medical care, there are some popular holiday destinations where travellers are at risk. Mexico, Turkey, Morocco and Thailand are among the holiday hotspots declared as 'medium risk' on the map, with some risk of diseases and emergency medical care described as 'adequate'. However, holidaymakers are recommended to search out quality medical providers and informed that in some severe cases they may need to be evacuated to another country. The key to the map is a colour-coded chart showing the quality of medical healthcare available and the options available to travellers: . BROWN . Large rapidly developing countries . Selected group of large rapidly developing countries where there is a vast difference between the high quality medical care available in major cities and low levels of care generally available throughout the rest of the country. Medical assistance: In major cities: Selection of quality providers. Evacuation sometimes required. Elsewhere: Selection of best care available. Case monitoring. Transfer to a higher quality facility. Moderate and sever illness/injury may require evacuations . GREEN . Low risk . International standard of care throughout. All tertiary-level, specialist and sub-specialist care widely available. High-quality emergency and dental services and a wide range of quality prescription drugs available. Low risk of infecyious diseases . Medical assistance: Medical referral. Assistance with language and cultural differences. Payment. Evacuation rarely required . YELLOW . Medium risk . High or international standard available from selected providers; other providers offer a lower standard of care. Adequate emergency services and dental care usually available. Some risk of water-borne diseases. Diseases such as malaria and dengue fever may be present. Medical assistance: Selection of quality providers. Case monitoring. Sever illness/injury may require evacuations. ORANGE . High risk . Countries with limited medical capabilities. Emergency services and dental care may be basic. Access to quality prescription drugs may be limited and, in some cases, counterfeiting and/or improper storage of drugs is an issue. Serious infectious diseases such as typhoid, cholera, dengue fever and malaria may pose a threat. Medical assistance: Selection of best care available Case monitoring. Transfer to a higher quality facility. Any condition requiring hospitalisation may require international evacuation. RED . Extreme risk . Countries where healthcare is almost non-existent or severely over-taxed. There may be no emergency or dental services, Quality prescription drugs are usually not available. There is a high risk of food or water-borne infections. Serious infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, typhoid and cholera are common. Medical assistance: Selection of best care available. Case monitoring. Transfer to a higher quality facility. All but minor health issues may require international evacuation. High-risk countries that are favourite holiday destinations include Tanzania, Egypt, Laos and Cambodia, with tourists recommended to transfer to a high-quality facility if they are taken ill and warned that any hospitalisation may result in an international evacuation. Countries deemed high risk have limited medical capabilities and access to prescription drugs, and have a risk of serious infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid or dengue fever. The most crisis-hit countries include many African nations as well as Afghanistan and North Korea as well as areas that have been affected by natural disasters in recent years such as Haiti. International SOS assessed the assessed various factors including the quality of medical and dental care, access to prescription drugs, prevalence of infectious diseases and cultural, administrative and language barriers. According to the map, the low-risk countries, with high-quality emergency health and dental care, a range of prescription drugs available and low risk of infectious disease include the US, Australia, New Zealand, Greece, the UK, Spain, France and the rest of western Europe. However, the overall level of healthcare offered in countries around the world reiterates the importance of travel insurance. For tourists who fall ill or are injured in countries where it is recommended they seek the highest-quality healthcare centres for treatment, medical costs can soon soar. However, with health insurers, worried holidaymakers can contact emergency helplines to find the best available medical centre available to them as part of their policy. Low-risk countries include the US, UK, Australia and Greece, while extreme-risk countries include Afghanistan, Syria, North Korea and Haiti . A new category was included on the map this year to highlight the disparity of care available in 'large rapidly developing countries', such as China, Brazil and Russia, where access to quality healthcare differs hugely between cities and more rural outposts. Doug Quarry, Medical Director, Medical Information and Analysis at International SOS said: 'Recent International SOS data shows that over 40 per cent of our medical cases occur in countries classed as 'High' or 'Extreme' risk. 'This is a significant increase from less than 25 per cent in 2010. Preparation of travellers, including a risk assessment, education and health check programme for staff, will reduce the need for intervention after travel. A doctor treats a baby in a paediatric ward in Afghanistan, which is an extreme-risk country on the 2015 healthcare map . 'This is especially important for people travelling to high and extreme risk countries. Health Risk Map 2015 is just one of the many tools that can help organisations plan and prepare for operations around the world.' International SOS works as a health security risk services company and has 53 clinics worldwide, 40 of which operate in areas where there are gaps in quality of medical care.","International SOS published International Health Risk Map showing the standard of healthcare around the world .

"Sick patients are being forced to wait up to four weeks for a GP appointment at a surgery where each doctor can see 100 patients a day. Chronic health conditions, an ageing population and problems recruiting doctors are pushing services to breaking point at the Crown Street Surgery in Swinton, near Rotherham. Its waiting list for non-urgent appointments is thought to be the longest in the country. Patients at the Crown Street Surgery in Swinton near Rotherham face four-week waits for an appointment . Patient Katrina Trickett, 32, said a three-week delay in getting an appointment meant that her minor illness became much more serious. ‘It’s really frustrating. I’m a full-time nursing student and I need to see someone when I’m off,’ she said. ‘You put it off and end up getting worse. I had a chest infection and it turned into pleurisy. ‘It was awful – you can’t move, you can’t breathe, the pressure in your chest is unreal.’ Retired care worker Jean Firth, 71, said: ‘I’ve only been in the practice two years but when I first came you got an appointment more or less the next day. ‘It’s a real worry especially as you get older because you never know what’s going to happen.’ Surgery partner Dr Krishna Kasaraneni, who earns a £60,000 salary and regularly works 80-hour weeks, said: ‘I’ve seen 50 patients today and it’s not even been four hours. I’ve got six more hours to go. ‘I’ve seen infections, mental health problems, bereavements, employment issues, someone who wants me to write them a letter regarding their housing situation.’ He added: ‘Established GPs are leaving because the work load is becoming untenable. ‘I have two locum GPs come in – they will work but they don’t want a permanent post because that ties you into the level of commitment and workload which they don’t want to accept ... It’s no wonder that with the proportion of the NHS budget [for general practice] eroded from 11 per cent to 8 per cent, that you then start seeing a huge influx of patients ending up in A&E.’ Doctors and patients at the surgery have all complained about the workload which causes long delays . A survey by the Mail last year found that nationwide, only one in three patients can secure a same-day GP appointment. More than one in five have to wait longer than a week, while 4 per cent have to wait two to three weeks. Research by the Royal College of GPs found that a 50 per cent increase in the number of family doctors will be needed by 2020 to cope with population changes and the current shortage. Patients at Crown Street with an urgent problem can be seen the same day – but the system relies on the person initially assessing themselves. They have to ask the receptionist for an emergency appointment, then speak to a doctor on the telephone who will decide. Practice manager Lynn Takacs said: ‘It’s dependent on what a patient thinks is urgent or not and we all have different scope. ‘So if it’s a mum with young children she might be less tolerant than a working man who is trying to fit it in, or an elderly woman who has got nobody to help her.’ Dr Kasaraneni said: ‘We are now living longer, we now have a lot more chronic medical conditions –hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, arthritis. ‘If we had enough funding to hire two more practice nurses and a couple of GPs then fantastic, that waiting list would come down significantly.’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘It is essential that practices have procedures in place to prioritise those patients with the most urgent needs and sometimes this means non-urgent patients having to wait longer. ‘But in many cases, patients don’t know if something is seriously wrong until they have seen their GP, and waiting a month for a GP appointment could be a risk to patient safety.’ Have you had to wait longer than three or four weeks to see a doctor?

"A man accused of killing a 15-year-old girl in a fake kidnapping that he planned to 'save' her from  is to go on trial today. Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, allegedly used a fake Facebook profile to set up a meeting with Nichole Cable in May 2013, but killed her in a botched kidnapping investigators say he had intended to 'solve himself'. Police said Dube told people he planned to abduct Nichole while wearing a ski mask, return later without the mask, 'find' her and look like a hero. Kyle Dube (pictured left) is accused of using a fake Facebook profile to set up a meeting with Nichole Cable (right) but killed her in the process of a botched kidnapping investigators say he intended to 'solve himself' Dube will appear in court today accused of creating the fake account to set up a meeting with Nichole, of Glenburn, before killing her and hiding her body on May 12, 2013. Nichole's mother reported her missing on May 13 and told police her daughter had left the night before to meet a friend at the end of their road but had not returned . Dozens of law enforcement officers, using aircraft and dogs, and hundreds of civilian volunteers spent days searching for Nichole. Her remains were found in Old Town on May 20, eight days after the abduction. The state's chief medical examiner found Nichole died as a result of asphyxiation. Police said the fake Facebook profile Dube allegedly set up was under  a different name but was traced back to Dube's home. Nichole Cable, aged 15, (pictured) was reported missing by her mother on May 13, who told police her daughter had left the night before to meet a friend at the end of their road but had not returned . The murder trial is expected to last two weeks. Dube's defense has already received a setback - the judge in the case has said will not allow his attorneys to name his ex-girlfriend as an alternative suspect in the killing. Defense attorneys wanted to name Dube's former girlfriend, who was dating Dube at the time of the killing, as an alternative suspect, saying the girl disliked Nichole because she believed Nichole and Dube were seeing each other. But on Friday Superior Court Justice Ann Murray  granted the state's motion to exclude defense attorneys from naming another possible suspect. Dube is accused of creating the fake Facebook account to set up a meeting with Nichole, of Glenburn, before killing her and hiding her body . The judge's order said that Dube 'set forth a tenuous suggestion of motive' in his call for the alternative suspect, but the defense's request 'does not reasonably establish any connection between' the girl and the crime. She wrote that there was also no evidence that the girl was at or near Nichole's home on the night of Cable's disappearance, and that 'this trial must be the trial of Kyle Dube.' Nichole's father, David Cable, declined to comment on the trial but said: 'If you're a father, you know how I'm feeling right now.' Her mother, Kristine Wiley, declined to comment. Friends and classmates of Nichole Cable at Old Town High School said after Dube's arrest that they planned to reduce or end their use of social media. Nearly two years later, the school district continues to stress the importance of using social media safely and responsibly, said David Walker, superintendent of Regional School Unit 34, which includes the high school. However, he added he has not seen a dramatic change in the way students use social media at the school. 'Hopefully they recognize that the Internet isn't always a safe place,' Walker said. 'Everyone is reminding students of the dangers, both parents and teachers.' If convicted of kidnapping and murder, Dube could face between 25 years and life in prison.

"It was the first mass market smartwatch, and now Pebble is set to fight back against the Apple and Google watches. Pebble has revealed a new model is coming tomorrow, and will feature a colour screen. The firm even accidentally leaked an image believed to show the watch on its website. Scroll down for video . Is this the new Pebble? The firm accidentally revealed the image on the left, showing a colour screen. Its website currently shows a countdown clock for the new watch with the image on the right. According to 9to5mac, the new watch is set to have a thinner design and a colour e-paper-like display. It spotted an image showing off the watch on Pebble's own servers. 'Now, thanks to an image hosted on Pebble’s own servers, we have a look at a device with a physical appearance matching the device we described. 'The device looks to have a larger bezel, as well as buttons that are smaller compared to its predecessor.' As we reported, the watch is going to be thinner than the current generation, but you can’t really see that based on this image alone. And while the new device will have a color display and a slimmer hardware profile, it’s said to have battery life that compares to the first generation Pebble. On the inside, the next Pebble is going to have a Cortex M4 processor and a 6-axis gyroscope. Unlike the Apple Watch, the new Pebble won’t have a touch screen, and its resolution is definitely on the low side compared to Apple’s upcoming device. Compatibility: The smartwatch is compatible with Android 2.3+ and iOS 5+ . Connectivity: The Pebble connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth . Messaging: Wearers can see texts, tweets, calls and app notifications – but they can’t use the watch to type messages or make calls, like with the Apple Watch, for example. Battery: The battery lasts for between five and seven days on a single charge and can be recharged using a USB cable with a magnetic connector. Tough: The watch is water resistant with a scratch and shatter-proof e-paper screen. Screen: 144 x 168 pixels, measuring 3.2cm . Apps: The watch has a ‘thriving’ app store with staples like Twitter as well as fitness apps. Users can also create their own. The Pebble can store eight apps and watch faces at a time. Extras: A vibrating silent alarm and hundreds of watch faces. Colours: White, black, red, grey and orange. Size: The watch is designed to fit most 2.2cm watch straps. It measures 5.2cm x 3.6cm x 1.15cm deep. Weight: 38g . Price: £99 ($99 in the US) and £180 ($199) for the Steel model. The current watch allows wearers to read texts and tweets on their wrist, as well as see incoming calls, check the weather, access fitness apps and tell the time. It is compatible with Apple and Android devices and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth so users don’t have to rummage in their handbag or pockets for their phone to see app notifications and messages, because they appear on the watch’s screen. Pebble’s device is the second most funded product in Kickstarter history and the new Pebble Steel model is also now available in the UK for £180. The Apple Watch is set to go on sale in April, with prices from $349 . The Moto 360 runs Google's Android Wear software - but has so far failed to attract buyers . They are water resistant and have a battery that lasts for between five and seven days. In contrast, it’s predicted that the Apple Watch, which is due to be released early next year, will need to be recharged daily. Firebox predicts that the already popular devices will be in demand from UK customers for Christmas, partly because they are more affordable than some rival offerings. Since its US release last year, Pebble has developed its open-source platform so that anyone can create an app for the device and companies are offering fitness tracker apps like Jawbone and Misfit, so people can check their running pace without carrying another gadget, for example. The watch has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark.

"Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, has launched an investigation into a Channel 4 docudrama which led to more than 6,500 complaints after it depicted people rioting in the streets following an imagined Ukip election win. The broadcaster has been accused of election bias and scaremongering after it painted a country marred by race riots and mass unemployment under an imagined leadership by Nigel Farage in 'Ukip: The First 100 Days'. The watchdog confirmed it has launched an investigation to determine whether rules on impartiality and offensive material have been broken following the airing of the programme on February 16. Scroll down for video . A Channel 4 docudrama about an imagined Ukip victory at the general election is to be investigated by Ofcom and could receive a formal notification or even a fine after the watchdog received more than 5,000 complaints . Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, has launched an investigation following the Channel 4 docu-drama . It could see Channel 4 face a fine of around £100,000 if it is found in breach and Ofcom finds this is so serious it requires a sanction. The First 100 Days has  become the most complained about one-off programme in Britain this year, sparking 5,262 complaints to the watchdog. A further 1,300 complaints were received by Channel 4. A spokesman for the communications watchdog said: 'Ofcom has carefully assessed a number of complaints about Ukip: The First 100 Days on Channel 4. 'We are opening an investigation into the programme as it may raise issues under our rules on offensive material, misleadingness and due impartiality. We are also considering fairness and privacy complaints about the programme. ' Investigations usually take around 50 days, but because of the election in May, Ofcom is not likely to publish its conclusions until after May 7. Often an investigation ends in a formal notification to a broadcaster, which is seen as a 'black mark' against their name. But in more extreme and rarer circumstances, often when there has been a repeat of the breach Ofcom can make a sanction. This is frequently in the form of a fine. Fictional MP Deepa Kaur the party's only Asian MP, is left grappling with a difficult situation in Romford . Race riots were shown to break out throughout the country three months after the imagined Ukip victory . Nigel Farage criticised the show after other people said they felt it was biased and scaremongering . The programme was broadcast last week and has become the most complained about one-off this year . The 5,262 objections to Ukip: The First 100 Days make the docu-drama one of the most complained about in Ofcom's history. Here are a few shows which beat the tally. Celebrity Big Brother race row: 44,500 . Comments made by Jade Goody to Shilpa Shetty in 2007 attracted the most complaints in the regulator's history and forced Channel 4 to issue a public apology. Jerry Springer the Opera: 8,860 . The stage satire prompted outrage in 2005 after a TV version aired on the BBC, showing the chat show host in the bowels of hell and a troupe of dancing Ku Klux Klan members. The X Factor (2009): 5,975 . The vast majority of complaints came from viewers when Dannii Minogue commented on the sexuality of singer Danyl Johnson. The X Factor (2010): 5,957 . The talent show's 2010 run was dogged by controversies including racy outfits on stage, a contestant who led a double life as a prostitute and claims that ratings-grabbing acts were kept in the show at the expense of talented singers. For example last year Discovery was fined £100,000 after it broadcast violent footage about female murderers, at breakfast time during the school holidays. Ofcom refused to reveal whether Ukip had complained about the show, saying it did not reveal details of individual complainants. The Channel 4 docudrama lasted one hour and was watched by more than 1million people. It depicted rioting on the streets in the wake of a slim Ukip general election victory in May and combined archive footage with imagined scenes. It shows the country teetering on the edge of destruction just three months after Ukip are elected. It also weaves in the racism and sexism scandals which have dogged the party recently. The Channel 4 show featured actress Priyanga Burford playing the part of the party's only Asian woman MP. Her character is elected for Romford in an imagined landslide which puts Mr Farage in Number 10, but she is left grappling with her conscience as a factory closes in her constituency after the UK withdraws from the EU. The programme - which depicted riots between protesters for and against tough anti-immigration raids - was strongly condemned by party leader Mr Farage. 'Look like 100 Days of Ukip may well have backfired on Channel 4. A biased, partisan depiction of the only party that Believes in Britain,' he wrote on his Twitter feed. Following confirmation that Ofcom would investigate the broadcaster a spokesman for Ukip said: A spokesman said,'UKIP are not going to comment about the programme as we did not make a complaint, though we understand why others might have wished to do so.' Audiences branded the show a 'hatchet job' as a number voiced their criticisms on Twitter, including comedian Jason Manford who raised concerns about bias. One viewer said: 'This is so biased from a mainstream media [organisation], it makes me furious - and I don´t even support Ukip.' Mr Farage tweeted after the programme that it appeared the show 'may well have backfired on Channel 4' The film combined acted scenes with actual news footage and showed race riots breaking out in Britain . Another wrote: 'I'm no Ukip fan, but this hatchet job Channel 4 is doing on them is quite anti-democratic and quite outrageous.' Channel 4 has said 'a lot of research' went into the docudrama and that Mr Farage had been invited to watch it before it was broadcast and then to do an interview afterwards but he declined. The broadcaster said it ordered the drama - which criticised Ukip, its leaders and its supporters - as a way of engaging people in politics in the run-up to the May General Election. Channel 4's head of documentaries Nick Mirsky defended the controversial drama, saying it was fair and timing was not an issue. He said: 'Our job is to reflect and explore contemporary British life. Nothing represents what's different and unique in British political life now more than the rise of Ukip. 'This might be what you wake up to after May 7.' Anger: The documentary featured a 'far-Right' demonstration in which the only banner was Israel's flag . One scene that raised hackles was a far-right protest where the only visible banner was the flag of Israel. Sebastian Payne, digital managing editor of political magazine The Spectator, wrote: 'Did Channel 4 just show the flag of Israel to suggest a group of protesters are from the 'far right'?!' One Twitter user, Nathanever82, wrote: 'You HAD to show an Israel flag in the fascist demonstration. You morons'. The criticism added to complaints that the documentary had used broad sweeping generalisations about the ideas of political left and right. Though one user, Tom Deakin, wrote: 'I've been to EDL counter-protests before and seen EDL supporters flying Israel's flag.' And it was later said the footage was in fact archive material from a real far-right protest in Doncaster last year. Anger: Some Twitter users were unhappy about the Israeli flag being depicted in a 'far-Right' protest .","Channel 4 broadcast 'Ukip: The First 100 Days' imagining their election win .

At the news conference today, Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters that 'I don't think we have any theories"" about what happened to the plane but said the FBI has been in touch with Malaysian investigators about providing any help that it can. 'We are in ongoing conversations about how we can help and we will make available whatever resources that we have, whatever expertise we have, that might be able to be used,' Holder said.

'We are in ongoing conversations about how we can help and we will make available whatever resources that we have, whatever expertise we have, that might be able to be used,' Holder said. Suggestions the flight may have deliberately been changed were challenged by the acting transport minister today. In words that appeared to rubbish a Reuters report suggesting MH370 used waypoints, or navigational points, after losing contact with ground control, he said: 'I am aware of speculation that additional waypoints were added to the aircraft’s flight routing. I can confirm that the aircraft flew on normal routing up until the waypoint IGARI. There is no additional waypoint on MH370’s documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.' Investigators at the conference also rubbished reports the . plane may have been sighted over the Maldives.

A woman look at the thousands of messages left for those missing aboard the flight at Kuala Lumpur Airport . The 'prayer wall' was started soon after the craft disappeared on March 8. No sign of the plane has been found . Thailand's military yesterday said they detected a plane at 1.28am, eight minutes after MH370's communications went down, heading towards the Strait but did not share the information because they were not asked for it. Writing on his blog, aviation expert David Learmount said: 'Maybe these states’ air defences, like Malaysia’s, are not what they are cracked up to be. 'And maybe they wouldn’t want the rest of the world to know that.' Mr Learmount, a former pilot and now operations and safety editor at the respected Flight Global publication, points out that MH370 might have flown over several Asian countries including Thailand, Burma, China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Holding back: Aviation expert David Learmount suggested some countries may be withholding radar information . If it emerges that an unidentified aircraft had been able to fly over a territory undetected and unchallenged it would amount to an embarrassing security failure. Regarding the Malaysian sighting Mr Learmount wrote: 'Clearly they had let an unidentified aircraft pass through Malaysian sovereign territory without bothering to identify it; not something they were happy to admit. 'The Malaysian government has called upon all the countries to the north-west as far as Turkmenistan and the Caspian Sea to check their primary radar records for unidentified contacts in their airspace in the seven hours after the 777 went missing. 'Depending on the actual track the aircraft followed, if it had headed approximately north-west this could include some–if not all–of the following countries: Thailand, Myanmar/Burma, China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. 'If the aircraft had gone that way, surely military primary radar in one of those countries–or several–would have picked up the signal from this unidentified aircraft, and the vigilant radar operator would have scrambled a fighter to intercept the intruder? 'Wouldn’t s/he? Or maybe not. Maybe these states’ air defences, like Malaysia’s, are not what they are cracked up to be. And maybe they wouldn’t want the rest of the world to know that.'","Malaysia says it has 'some radar data' on missing flight MH370 .

"In the past year, 545 tons of red cabbage have been bought in Britain . Sales of red cabbage are booming as growing numbers of shoppers get wise to its health benefits. In the past year, 545 tons have been bought in Britain – up nearly 50 per cent on the previous 12 months. And the amount consumers spent on red cabbage soared by 26.4 per cent to £590,000, according to trade magazine The Grocer. The variety is one of the most nutritious cabbages – containing ten times more vitamin A and twice as much iron as the traditional green type. British supplier Produce World said that although red cabbage sales peaked at Christmas, they remain strong. Other varieties are also selling well, with Sweetheart up by 29.9 in volume on the past year, figures from market analyst Kantar Worldpanel reveal. Produce World agricultural director Andrew Burgess said that cabbages offer high ‘nutritional value and versatility’. He believes more consumers are coming round to the high nutritional value of the vegetable and are eating it all-year-round and not just at Christmas. 'Cabbages have been part of a staple diet of many UK households for years due to its nutritional value and versatility as a vegetable,' he said. 'Luckily the UK has the ideal growing conditions to grow the best cabbages in the world, with Produce World providing enough for nearly half a million UK consumers every year.' Cabbages are showing strong volume growth generally, including new varieties such as Pointed Sweetheart and old favourites like White cabbage and Savoy - which posted 15.2% and 7.2% volume growth respectively.

"The Government moved a small step closer to returning Lloyds Banking Group to private ownership today as it sold 1 per cent of shares, raising £500million. Chancellor George Osborne said he was 'delighted' at further progress being made to claw back taxpayers' money pumped into the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The announcement comes ahead of a crucial week for the group, which is expected to announce in its results on Friday that it will resume payments of dividends to shareholders for the first time since falling foul of the financial crisis in 2007. Going private? The government has reduced its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to 23.9 per cent today . This morning, shares in Lloyds are up by 0.68p or 0.87 per cent to 78.66p. Today's share sale by the government reduces its stake from 24.9 per cent to 23.9 per cent. During the financial crisis, UK taxpayers pumped £20billion into the bank, giving the government a 41 per cent shareholding. The Coalition Government wants to aim to reduce its stake in the bank before May's election as a prelude to returning it full privatisation. By selling the 1 per cent stake in the group - which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland as well as other financial brands such as Scottish Widows - the government said it raised £500million. The shares were sold as UK Financial Investments, which manages the government's stakes in bailed out banks, hired Morgan Stanley In December to sell Lloyds' shares on the stock market through a 'pre-arranged trading plan'. The sales since made by Morgan Stanley, all at a price above the 73.6p average price that the government paid,  take the total amount raised by the government so far from selling down its stake in Lloyds to just under £8 billion. Chancellor George Osborne said: 'I am delighted to announce today that the trading plan I launched in December has raised a further £500 million for the taxpayer so far. 'This is further progress in returning Lloyds Banking Group to private ownership, reducing our national debt and getting taxpayers' money back'. Chancellor George Osborne said he was 'delighted' at further progress being made to claw back taxpayers' money pumped into the bank at the height of the financial crisis . A pre-election sale of shares in Lloyds to ordinary members of the public was ruled out last year by Chancellor George Osborne. The Government has chosen to sell the stock over time 'in an orderly and measured way' rather than through large tranches as has been done previously. It said in December that it hoped to sell off a stake of up to 5 per cent in Lloyds over the following six months of 2015 in order to raise about £3billion. In its latest set of results on Friday, Lloyds is expected to announce that it will start to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since its collapse into state-ownership. The bank is expected to report annual pre-tax profits of around £2billion, up from £415million a year earlier, after putting aside another £600million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. In the money: Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio is set to receive a £7million windfall for hitting targets set in 2012 . But, the bank's results run the risk of being overshadowed by a £7million payment to chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio for hitting targets set out in March 2012. The shares bonus – almost 50 times David Cameron's £142,500 salary – stems from a performance-related award given to Mr Horta-Osorio shortly after he took the helm in 2011, which was signed off by the Treasury. It comes on top of a pay package worth up to £4million, putting the 51-year-old Portuguese chief on course to rake in £11million. Investec Securities analyst Ian Gordon said in a note: 'In December 2014, when UKFI announced its plan to 'dribble' shares into the market through H1 2015, it was subject to considerable criticism, with many commentators arguing that Lloyds shares were now effectively 'dead money'. 'Today UKFI announces that it has already sold a further c.1 per cent stake for c.£500m over the past 7 weeks, reducing its residual holding to 23.9%. During this period Lloyds has been the 2nd best performing FTSE100 bank (behind Barclays (Buy)), offering UKFI a strong sense of vindication? BUY.' Looking ahead to Lloyds full year 2014 results on Friday, Mr Gordon said he expected the 'restoration of a 'token' 1p dividend, with scope for very material growth in the pay-out through 2015-17'. While Lloyds is set to report a boost to profits on Friday, HSBC has reported a 17 per cent drop in annual pre-tax profits to £12.1billion this morning. Shares in HSBC are down 31.75p or 5.25 per cent to 573.45p this morning.","Treasury has sold 1% of shares and reduced its stake from 24.9% to 23.9% .

"The secret to happiness in modern Britain is earning £80,840 a year and living in a £443,000 house. At least that's according to a new study which has found that the ideal life would involve working a 27-hour week and having two children. The ideal four-bedroom family home should be no more than 45 miles from the rest of people's direct family, although some Britons insist they want to live less than a mile from their loved ones. The secret to happiness in modern Britain is earning £80,840 a year and living in a £443,000 house with a partner and two children, a study has found (picture posed by models) Men and women have slightly different ideas on their ideal partner, according to the research by 3M Post-it. While the average man wants a wife who is three-and-a-half years younger than him, the ideal partner for women is just over a year older. Men also seem to be more materialistic in their goals, saying they would need a salary of £96,010 to make them truly happy, while women insist £68,770 would suffice. A third of people say their main goal in life is earning more money, with 15 per cent of those surveyed saying they would not be satisfied until they earn more than £100,000 a year. However, a fifth of people insist their happiness is not dependent on salary, while 60 per cent say money cannot buy happiness. Two in five lucky people believe they have already achieved true happiness while 23 per cent fear they will never be truly happy, the research found. After being wealthy, high up on most people's life goals is starting a family and travelling the world (pictured posed by models) Sadly, 16 per cent of us believe we will never get close to achieving our dreams. Men want to live in a more upmarket home than women, aiming for one worth £498,000 compared to £402,000 for their female counterparts. Earn more money . Travel the world . Live healthy lifestyle .

The research suggests the other things we strive for to achieve our ideal life are to travel the world (33 per cent), live a healthy lifestyle (33 per cent), lose weight (28 per cent) and fall in love with ‘the one’ (28 per cent). The study shows that 62 per cent of people believe the health, wealth and happiness of loved ones contributes more to an ideal life than our own health, wealth and happiness. One in five women would be happiest with their family living within one mile, compared to just over one in ten men. Meanwhile 16 per cent of women believe family commitments get in the way of achieving their life goals, compared to just 8 per cent of men.","Ideal life involves working 27-hour week and earning £80,840, survey says .

"Prince Philip was sporting a badly-bruised eye at a reception to commemorate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta at Buckingham Palace this evening. The 93-year-old Duke of Edinburgh was also wearing two butterfly stitches on a cut to his right ear that he received during his Christmas Break in Sandringham last month. Buckingham Palace do not comment on the health of the royal family but played down Philip's new facial injury by saying that he was: 'Well enough to attend the event this evening.' Scroll down for video . The Duke of Edinburgh had some painful-looking bruising to his eye at an event at Buckingham Palace this evening to commemorate the Magna Carta. He also had two butterfly stitches on a cut that he had sustained a couple of weeks earlier while on his Christmas break in Sandringham . It isn't the first time that the Duke has sported a black eye in recent years - in April 2013, he carried a similar mark under the same eye during an official engagement in Canada. At the time, it was reported that he hadn't fallen and had simply woken up with the mark on his face. The Duke was at the event this evening to accompany The Queen in her capacity as Patron of the Magna Carta Trust. Several Members of Parliament, constitutional historians, representatives of non-governmental organisations, and senior figures from the legal profession attended the reception at the palace  to celebrate 800 years since the Magna Carta was sealed in 1215. Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, is greeted by Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Chris Grayling (fourth right) The Queen was dressed in a bright red dress with a matching jacket . The Queen wore a bright red dress with a matching jacket and accessorised with a diamond brooch, a pair of pearl earrings and a pearl necklace. During the event, guests were given the opportunity to view a facsimile of Magna Carta, provided by the British Library. King John agreed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history. Dr Claire Breay of the British Library talks The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh through the details of the Magna Carta . Dr Claire Breay (left) and Clive Izard (centre) from the British Library discuss the Magna Carta with The Queen and Prince Philip . Meaning 'The Great Charter', the Magna Carta brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law and had the right to fair trial. The manuscript has a large influence on the rule of law in Britain today, giving all citizens the right to justice and a fair trial. Prince Philip sported a similar bruise in April 2013, during a visit to Canada . It says: 'No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. 'To no-one will we sell, to no-one deny or delay right or justice.' Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived. The Magna Carta influenced  Thomas Jefferson when he helped draft the Declaration of Independence. It also influenced the writers of the French constitution and the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, who cited it in his famous speech in his own defence at the Rivonia trial in 1964. A 13th century copy of the Magna Carta manuscript . What is Magna Carta? Magna Carta is an 800-year-old document containing the idea that no-one is above the law, and it still forms the foundation of many modern ideas and documents today. What does Magna Carta mean? It means 'Great Charter' in Latin. In fact the whole document is in Latin. When and where was Magna Carta granted? Magna Carta was first drawn up in 1215, granted by King John on June 15 at Runnymede near the River Thames in Surrey. Why was Magna Carta first written and granted? It was originally meant as a peace treaty between King John and his barons, with whom he was at war. Is it true that King John never 'signed' Magna Carta? Yes, at least not in the way we think of signing. Back in the Middle Ages kings never signed their name on documents to pass them into law. Instead John used his Great Seal to authenticate the document. How much of Magna Carta is relevant today? The original Magna Carta had 63 clauses. Today, only three of the original 63 clauses remain on the statute books. Of these three survivors one defends the liberties and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns, and the third gives all English subjects the right to justice and a fair trial.","The Duke of Edinburgh was sporting a black eye at reception this evening .

"Foreigners will be banned from entering Britain unless they have health insurance, under Ukip plans  announced today. Ukip leader Nigel Farage set out a raft of new policies on improving the nation's health, including more dementia funding, scrapping hospital parking charges and hiring more nurses, midwives and GPs. But the party's health spokesman has faced questions about whether Mr Farage's reputation for smoking and posing drinking beer in pubs is the best advertisement for a healthy lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage used a speech today in Rochester to hit back at claims Ukip wanted to privatise the NHS . Today's policy launch move is part of a strategy by Ukip - which is largely associated with campaigning to leave the European Union and control immigration - to show that it has a fully worked-out programme for government. In doing so, however, it will inevitably open itself up to greater scrutiny by the media and by its political rivals. A flagship policy will be forcing migrants, students and visitors to show they have approved medical insurance before they are allowed into Britain as part of the crackdown on 'health tourism'. The party's health spokesman Louise Bours will claim the move will stop up to £2billion being lost every year because of foreigners using the NHS to get treatment or prescriptions. In a speech unveiling the party's plans for the health service today, the Ukip MEP will warn 'it's the NHS itself that needs emergency care and nursing back to health'. Under the plans, foreigners will only be entitled to free healthcare after they have contributed through taxation for five years. It would apply to anyone wanting to come to Britain if it is outside the the European Union. Mr Farage has previously suggested a move towards an insurance based health system, but Miss Bours said yesterday there will be 'absolutely not a whiff of privatisation' in the proposals. Today the Ukip leader hit out at Labour claims that the party backed privatisation. He said: 'Ukip is committed to an NHS that is free at the point of access and paid for out of taxation, full stop. 'But just because we believe in the NHS it doesn't mean we can't be critical of certain aspects of it. Certainly what we have seen over the last few years is a huge increase in money but not always a compensating increase in productivity.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage set out his party's health policies, but questions have been raised about his own unhealthy habits like drinking and smoking . The party said it will use £200million of the saving to end hospital car parking charges in England. Explaining the proposals to make health insurance mandatory for foreigners, Miss Bours told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'I think as Britons when we go abroad, if we travel abroad as a visitor or worker, I think Britons as a matter of course purchase life insurance or medical insurance or baggage insurance, I think it's something that we do quite naturally, we don't even think about it. 'What we are saying is, what is the problem in asking people to do exactly the same when they come here? So if you are a migrant worker or a visitor or a student, you should have medical insurance, that is absolutely fundamental. 'I think the easiest way to do that, it should be a condition of entry into the country through the visa process.' Ukip will also pledge to provide an extra 20,000 nurses, 3,000 midwives and 8,000 GPs through an annual £3billion funding boost for the NHS it says will be paid for with savings made by leaving the European Union. The focus on health pits Ukip against Labour, which has vowed to make the NHS a central feature of its election campaign. But Mr Farage's image as a smoker and drinker appears at odds with the idea of putting him in charge of the nation's health. Challenged about her leader's unhealthy habits, Miss Bours admitted that the party had to focus on 'prevention' of drink and smoking-related illnesses. She told Sky News: 'Well Nigel obviously went all of January without one drink entirely… But seriously, absolutely, we have to look at prevention. 'I think that 70 per cent of things that are treated on the NHS are preventative. We have to look at how we put out a really good positive message, however does that mean that I believe in a nanny state where we order people not to drink? 'You know, people, we are adults, we must make our own choices and I think that's very important but absolutely, we have to look at that kind of thing, prevention. Obesity as well is obviously a big one that we're going to have to look at.' Ukip health spokesman Louise Bours said Mr Farage had managed to give up drinking for January, but conceded that the party's policy had to focus on preventable illnesses . Miss Bours, a former actress, added that she has a 'unique view' on the NHS, because she has never worked in healthcare. She said: 'I think that actually gives me a unique view because I am looking at it from the same as everybody else, the users' point of view and what the people want.' Mr Farage used his speech to set out Ukip's plans to invest an additional £3billion in front-line NHS services. Among the measures to be unveiled is a commitment to invest £650million in dementia research over the lifetime of the parliament - more than double the amount pledged by David Cameron at the weekend. Under the party's plans, the Care Quality Commission watchdog would be abolished and responsibility for hospital inspections passed to local health boards which would be encouraged to take evidence from whistle-blowers and patients with grievances. Hospital managers would have to be licensed in the same way as doctors and nurses in a move which the party says is designed to 'negate the drift' of disgraced hospital managers who are fired from one job only to take up another elsewhere in the NHS. Tuition fees for medical students would be scrapped on what the party says would be a means-tested basis, and less highly qualified state enrolled nurses (SENs) reintroduced in a drive to encourage more 'home-grown medical talent'. The party also says that merging health and social care would be a priority, with funding for social care for the elderly raised to £1 billion a year. Labour frontbencher Jon Trickett said: 'Ukip has a long-standing record of support for increased NHS privatisation and NHS charging. 'Nigel Farage has made clear that he personally believes in increased NHS privatisation, so a single speech cannot hide their real agenda.'","Ukip to set out health policies in first major pre-election announcement .

'Look the Prime Minister is an exceptionally capable and good individual and sometimes the good even gets better, and that is what the Prime Minister has committed himself to doing—to be, as he said publicly, more consultative with the backbench and with the community,' Senator Abetz replied. Senator Wong then asked: 'And so is the ""I've changed"" being more consultative with the backbench and the community?' Senator Abetz replied: 'Oh, amongst many other things I'm sure.' Senator Wong pressed the Leader of the Government in the Senate to list them. 'What are the other things?' she asked. Senator Abetz said he would answer at a later date.

"The average American has a one in nine chance of joining the wealthiest one per cent of the nation, study shows. About 11 per cent of workers in the United States will move into the top one per cent of income earners for at least a year sometime between the ages of 25 and 60. This could mean that there's more income mobility in America than one might think - at least in the top tiers if income earners. The higher a person is on the income ladder, the more income fluidity he or she has, a study shows. One in nine Americans has the chance of joining the wealthiest one per cent at some point in their lifetime (file photo) For those in the top five and ten per cent of the wealthiest in the nation, there's more fluidity between the 99 and one per cent, according to a study done by professors Tom Hirschl of Cornell University and Mark Rank of Washington University. The researchers found that by the age of 60, 70 percent will spend at least a year in the top 20 percent of earners and 53 percent will spend at least a year in the top 10 percent. Additionally, 36 percent will spend at least a year in the top five percent and 11 percent will spend at least a year in the top one percent. Indicators for top-level wealth included, education, marriage, race, age and disability status. Race appears to be a dominant factor (file photo) As of 2012, those who had an adjusted gross income of $434,682 were in the top one per cent of income earners, according to CBS. But when they looked at the demographic of Americans who are more likely to float around in the upper levels of income, findings are less surprising. They found they are mostly older, white, married, educated for more than 12 years and lacking any work disability. Of those who made it to the top one per cent, however, only 1.6 per cent stayed for five consecutive years and only .06 per cent stayed for more than ten years. And as the level of income gets lower down the ladder, fluidity seems to remain - of those in the top 20 per cent of earners, the odds of staying at that level for more than a decade is just one in five, research showed. 'Income fluidity is a double-edged sword,' the authors wrote, 'creating opportunity for many, along with insecurity that this opportunity may end sooner than hoped for.' The strongest indicators of top-level wealth are education, marriage and race. The researchers found race such a dominant factor that it 'suggests persisting patterns of social inequality related to past and present discrimination and exclusion'. 'Thus it would be misguided to presume that top-level income attainment is solely a function of hard work, diligence, and equality of opportunity,' they wrote. Other studies have shown that there is less income mobility at lower wealth levels. Once study found that for fathers in the bottom 20 per cent of earners, 42 per cent of their sons remain at the low levels.","Eleven per cent of U.S. workers  will move into top one per cent of earners .

"The photographer who last week shared photographs of Australian cricket legend Glenn McGrath posing with a gun beside the bodies of hunted animals, has revealed he has received countless death threats since Friday. Acclaimed wildlife photographer Christopher Rimmer, who is originally from South Africa, has spent much of his life shooting animals in the region - but always from behind the lens of a camera rather than the barrel of a gun. Rimmer, who is currently based in Melbourne, posted the images of McGrath to his Facebook page last week, after they were sent to him by a friend. But he said the response online had been 'awful'. 'There’s no greater crime in Australia than exposing the shortcomings of a sportsman', he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Wildlife photographer Christopher Rimmer (pictured) has told of the backlash he's received online following the publication of images of Glenn McGrath posing with dead animals . The series of photographs of the ex-cricketer posing next to dead African animals, emerged via Facebook on Friday . In the photographs - taken on a hunting trip in 2008 - McGrath is pictured holding a gun and smiling with his kill, including an elephant, water buffalo and hyenas. 'A friend of mine sent the photographs over saying that he thought that it was a famous cricket player,' Rimmer said. 'I was very suspicious of the photographs at first and I put them into my big editing suite to check if they had been photo-shopped.' he continued. After determining the images had not been altered, he decided to post them online. 'In the end I thought the public interest was better served by showing them,' he said. However Rimmer said the response from people online had been 'pretty awful,' and revealed that he had revealed numerous death threats from people whose Facebook pages were adorned with photographs of their children clutching dead animals. 'I knew given what I do and the people that follow me that I thought there would be a strong reaction but I never imagined it would be as intense as its been,' Rimmer revealed. 'Some of the language employed from people that are pro-wildlife has been pretty crazy really,' he said, adding that he didn't know whether the hunters or animal liberators had been worse. Rimmer, who is currently based in Melbourne, is originally from South Africa and said the response from both sides of the argument had been 'crazy' The photographer's upcoming exhibition features photographs from the area showcasing the incredible wildlife and landscape . 'It's indicative of how extreme everything is these days.' He said he had received over 400 personal messages through his website and Facebook page since he published the photographs, but had stopped reading them due to the atrocious many of them were. Rimmer did emphasise that many people had been positive about the airing of the photos, and he presented them without comment on the original post. 'I put it out there and didn't tell people what to think of them', he said. When asked about his take on the sport of killing animals for the sake of it, Rimmer said although he didn't condone it, he also though McGrath chose a poor park to kill the African creatures. 'Personally I’m repulsed by the idea of killing an animal for pleasure,' he said. 'My main point is that Glenn McGrath should have done his research before he went to Zimbabwe.' On the apology from the sports star, the photographer said: 'He came up with that apology pretty quickly, and it shows.' Rimmer also described the invoking of McGrath's wife Jane's death in the actions were in poor taste. The photographer grew up in South Africa, and his upcoming exhibition features photographs from the area showcasing the incredible wildlife and landscape. At the weekend former Australian Test player Brett Lee was also dragged into the Glenn McGrath hunting controversy after an image of the pair posing with a dead animal emerged. A spokesman for Brett Lee (second from left) confirmed that this photograph was taken at a farm in South Africa. Glenn McGrath is pictured on the far right . Daily Mail Australia has uncovered a photograph of the cricketers in the company of two young boys, smiling next to a bleeding deer. Lee has one hand placed casually on the dead animal and the other around a child's shoulders. A spokesman for the 38-year-old confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 'yes, that photo was taken on a farm in South Africa'. The new image comes just a day after McGrath attracted mass criticism for a series of images from a 2008 African hunting trip. In 2006, McGrath opened up about the hunting trips he has enjoyed on his New South Wales country property with Lee and fellow Australian bowler Jason Gillespie, in an interview with Australian Shooter. He explained that Lee enjoys hunting, whilst Gillespie was an amateur with firearms. McGrath is a life member with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia and defended the practice in 2006, explaining that he sees it as a 'bonding' activity between himself and his mates. 'I don't expect people to feel the same way about [shooting], and at the same time, I don't expect others to force their opinions on me,' he told AS in 2006. 'I do have a passion for hunting and it is something I do want to continue once I've finished with cricket.' Social media users slammed the former cricketer on Twitter and Facebook . Some went as far as to announce they would boycott his cancer charity the McGrath Foundation . However, McGrath issued a statement on Twitter soon after the images surfaced on Saturday, saying he 'deeply regretted' the experience. 'In 2008 I participated in a hunting safari in Zimbabwe that was licensed and legal but in hindsight highly inappropriate,' McGrath wrote. 'It was an extremely difficult time in my life and looking back I deeply regret being involved'. The 'difficult time' McGrath referred to in the statement is understood to be a reference to the death of his wife Jane McGrath, who died of Breast Cancer in June 2008. She died at the age of 42, eleven years after she was diagnosed, after co-founding the McGrath Foundation with her husband. When the images emerged, the photograph of a beaming McGrath sitting in front of a dead elephant in Zimbabwe with a gun in his lap was considered particularly distressful amongst Twitter users. African elephants are classified as 'vulnerable' by animal welfare groups. McGrath has openly expressed his passion for hunting in the past during an interview with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia . Social media users slammed the ex-cricketer after the photos emerged . Dozens of Twitter users continue to express their disgust for the photos, with many also saying they would boycott the cancer charity . Twitter users continue to express their disgust for the photos, with many also saying they would boycott the cancer charity. 'Glenn McGrath game hunter. Yes, that's a dead elephant he's grinning about. Won't give any more $ to his foundation,' Kerry Glover wrote on the platform. However, another Twitter user pointed out that the cancer patients would suffer greatly if charity was targeted. 'We need to look at the foundation and Glenn McGrath as two separate identities... don't kill Jane's dream,' tweeted Vivienne. 'Boycotting The McGrath Foundation and the women it helps is pathetic. Get a grip,' tweeted another. User Sandy Lanceley wrote: 'Just lost an enormous amount of respect for @glennmcgrath11, hunting in Africa? Hang your head'. The photos, which were originally posted to the Zimbabwean canned hunting group Chipitani Safari's website, have since been removed. The 'difficult time' McGrath referred to in the statement is understood to be a reference to the death of his wife Jane McGrath (pictured), who died of Breast Cancer in June 2008 .

The Planet Ark ambassador has openly expressed his passion for hunting in the past during an interview with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia. 'I'm keen to get into trophy hunting, no animal in particular, but a big safari in Africa would be great,' he said. 'I'd prefer to do the safari on foot, like they did in the old days and just take the camp with you, not driving around in 4WDs.' Now a cricket commentator and president of the McGrath Foundation, McGrath met his current wife Sara Leonardi during a trip to Cape Town in South Africa in 2009. Planet Ark denied any association with the ex-cricketer today. 'We have only been made aware of these activities today. We are deeply saddened by the deaths of these animals and in no way endorse or support this activity. Planet Ark does not have an ongoing association with Glenn McGrath.'

"Julie Bishop revealed she should have been a long distance runner in a recent interview and now she has taken strides to show that she was not joking. The foreign affairs minister hit the pavement on Monday morning on the way to Parliament House in the nation's capital. Sporting a blue tank top layered over a pink T-shirt, Australia's most powerful woman gripped her phone as she made tracks to work. Scroll down for video . The foreign affairs minister hit the pavement on Monday morning on the way to Parliament House in the nation's capital . Although she was out of office for her training she was seen with her phone gripped tightly in her hand . Leading by example! Health Minister Susan Ley also turned up to work in her exercise gear after some early morning training . Julie Bishop had swapped her training gear for a more appropriate option by the time she took her place next to the Prime Minister Tony Abbott in parliament . But she was not alone in trying to get more active. Health Minister Sussan Lay was also seen strapping on her blue sneakers. Dressed in a navy workout skirt and teal T-shirt, Ms Lay was seen entering Parliament House with a black handbag on her shoulder. In a candid interview with Australian Women's Weekly in this month's issue, Ms Bishop spoke about her love of running and how it was her way to relax after a hard day's work. 'I'll run and run and run... I should have been a long distance runner,' she said. It has been a stressful few weeks for Ms Bishop who has been negotiating with the Indonesian government to stop the execution of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman. Dressed in a navy workout skirt and teal T-shirt, Ms Lay was seen entering Parliament House with a black handbag on her shoulder . The foreign affairs minister has said that she loves to exercise and that it helps her overcome jetlag . Julie Bishop has revealed she should have been a 'long distance runner' in a magazine interview because she runs to get over jetlag and it helps to keep her balanced and focused . Ms Bishop, who became the first female deputy leader of the Liberal Party and the first to be Foreign Affairs Minister, is now one of the most famous faces in Australian politics . Along with that, she has had to stave off rumours of her taking over the top job from Tony Abbott. But all these issues seemed a million miles away for Ms Bishop as she worked up a sweat on the streets of Canberra. The foreign minister has made no secret that she is a keen runner. She runs to get over jetlag after meeting with some of the world's most powerful leaders. Even when Ms Bishop is back home in Perth at the beach taking time out from the hustle and bustle of Canberra, she's still running. The 58-year-old has even spent the past 17 years climbing up the political ranks. Ms Bishop, who became the first female deputy leader of the Liberal Party and the first woman to be foreign minister, is now one of the most famous faces in Australian politics. She is renowned for her immaculate and polished appearance as she makes deals and shakes hands with some of the world's most powerful leaders. But when she does go back home, she can often be found having a coffee at the surf club where she is vice-patron in just a 'T-shirt and shorts', the magazine reports. It's in stark contrast to the Armani brand clothing, red high heels and pearl and diamond earrings she is normally photographed wearing. People have revealed deep down Ms Bishop is in fact a 'girly girl', but she maintains it only takes her 30 minutes to shower, dress and do her hair and make-up every morning. Ms Bishop, who is renowned for her immaculate and polished appearance, holds her own in the male-dominated top ranks of the Liberal party . She regularly flies across the world to meet with the top leaders in her role as Foreign Minister . Ms Bishop first took up a ministry position when former Prime Minister John Howard (back) appointed her as Minister for Ageing in 2003. She is pictured here being sworn in by Governor-General Michael Jeffery (right) Ms Bishop, who up until last year was the only woman in Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Cabinet, is no stranger to operating in a male-dominated environment. As a new recruit in her first job at a legal firm in 1978, Ms Bishop was asked to hand around drinks at a function while her male counterpart was allowed to mingle with the partners. 'I knew I couldn't stay at that firm,' she told Women's Weekly. At age 38, she became managing partner at Clayton Utz law firm and was tasked with managing 27 top male lawyers. Yet she famously came out last year and refused to identify herself as a feminist. She  does not have children, but her new relationship with property developer David Panton received a flurry of attention when they were photographed at the Melbourne Cup racing carnival together last year . Despite Liberal leadership speculation over the past month, Ms Bishop still maintains she is happy in her current role as Foreign Minister . She is not married and does not have children, but her new relationship with property developer David Panton received a flurry of attention when they were photographed at the Melbourne Cup racing carnival together last year. Her popularity has jumped over the past 12 months, mainly due to her strong performance on the international stage in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security. Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine. Ms Bishop grew up on a cherry farm and was educated at the prestigious St Peter's Collegiate Girls School in Adelaide. She is pictured in 1982 . Then Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull (centre) and  Ms Bishop as they watch a demonstration on a rocket propelled grenade during their visit to meet the solders in Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan in 2009 .

But despite Liberal leadership speculation over the past month, Ms Bishop still maintains she is happy in her current role as Foreign Minister.

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have abandoned a key military base in their stronghold Mosul after the U.S. announced a massive operation to retake  the city, it has been claimed. Intensified airstrikes on the terror group's Western Iraqi stronghold have seen hundreds of jihadis flee their main base in the south of the oil rich city, according local media reports. ISIS captured Mosul last summer in the group's lightning advance across vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, which led to the Sunni extremist group declaring itself a caliphate and the terrorists' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivering a filmed sermon in the city's main mosque. News of the withdrawal came after a senior U.S. military official announced a massive operation to retake Iraq's second-largest city  using up to 25,000 Iraqi troops will likely begin in April or May. Scroll down for video . Fighting: Intensified airstrikes on the terror group's Western Iraqi stronghold have seen hundreds of jihadis flee their main base in the south of the oil rich city, according local media reports . Islamic State fighters parade in a commandeered Iraqi security forces armoured vehicle through the Iraqi city of Mosul in June last year. The U.S. is planning a massive operation to retake the city in April or May . Sprawling terror: News of the offensive comes amid reports ISIS is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa . News that ISIS had abandoned the military base was first reported by Al-Arabiya yesterday. It comes just days after U.S. officials took the surprising step of announcing details of their joint operation with the Iraqi Army to retake the country's second largest city from Islamic State militants in just a few months. Iraqi officials continue to insist they haven't gotten the advanced weapons they need for the operation, and some question whether they will be ready for a spring offensive. But the Pentagon insists the U.S. has sent tens of thousands of weapons and ammunition and more is in the pipeline. Hakim al-Zamili, the head of the security and defense committee in the Iraqi parliament, told The Associated Press Friday that 'any operation would be fruitless' unless the brigades are properly prepared and have the weapons they need. 'I think if these weapons are not made available soon, the military assault might wait beyond spring,' he said. 'The Americans might have their own calculations and estimations, but we as Iraqis have our own opinion. We are fighting and moving on the ground, so we have better vision and April might be too soon.' A U.S. Central Command official provided some details of the battle plan on Thursday, saying the coordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and will involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops. They have cautioned, however, that if the Iraqis aren't ready, the timing could be delayed. The operation to retake Mosul should begin in April or May utilising 12 Iraqi brigades made up of between 20,000 and 25,000 troops . ISIS captured Mosul last summer in the group's lightning advance across vast swathes of Syria and Iraq . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivered a filmed sermon in Mosul's main mosque last summer . The core of the fighting force will be five of Iraq's most accomplished brigades, who will go through additional U.S. training before the operation. But al-Zamili said that while several of Iraq's units have gone through training recently, 'these well-trained brigades cannot get involved in battles without being equipped with advanced and effective weapons that would enable them to penetrate enemy lines.' His comment reflects a common complaint from the Iraqi government, both in recent months and throughout much of the Iraq war. The U.S., however, has sent tens of thousands of weapons, ammunition, body armor and other equipment to the country. According to a senior defense official, the U.S. sent nearly 1,600 Hellfire missiles to Iraq last year, and has already delivered 232 more. About 10,000 M-16 assault rifles are due to arrive in the next few weeks, along with 23,000 ammunition magazines. The U.S. also has delivered thousands of rockets, mortar rounds, tank rounds, .50-caliber rounds and 10,000 M-68 combat optical sights, a rifle scope commonly used by the U.S. military.

Grim collection: Peshmerga forces gather the bodies of ISIS militants near Mosul yesterday . Peshmerga troops collect the bodies of ISIS fighters following clashes near Mosul yesterday . About 250 mine-resistant, armor-protected vehicles will be delivered in a few weeks, along with sophisticated radio systems for the MRAPs and more ammunition rounds, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The public discussion of the operation, including how many Iraqi brigades would be involved and how Kurdish Peshmerga military would be used, triggered questions about whether it provided any key information to the enemy. The Pentagon doesn't often disclose as much about an operation before it takes place, but in some cases it can be a strategic tactic intended to affect the enemy, trigger a reaction or even prompt some militants to flee before the assault begins. Military officials also said none of the information released by U.S. Central Command could be put to any operational use by the Islamic State militants. The operation itself comes as no surprise to the Islamic State group. Iraqi leaders have for months made it publicly clear that they were planning an operation to retake Mosul and that they were eager to get started. In addition, U.S. officials had already acknowledged they were beginning preparations for the Mosul mission, including using airstrikes to shut down supply lines the insurgents were using to get equipment or people in and out of the city.","ISIS militants began fleeing key base near Mosul stronghold yesterday .

"Claudia Doughty hasn't eaten or had something to drink in seven years. The smiling 10-year-old from Brisbane is fed through a tube in her stomach as a result of an extremely rare condition that went undiagnosed until just two months ago. After a decade in and out of hospital enduring countless needles and operations, Claudia's parents were told their bubbly daughter had Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation type 1e (CDG1e) - a metabolic defect that effects just eight people worldwide. Claudia, who is the only recorded case in Australia, can't talk or eat and she has major global developmental delays. Claudia Doughty, 10, has an extremely rare metabolic condition that took a decade for doctors to diagnose . 'It's scary because there's no research about it because it truly is so rare,' her mother Simone told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's absolutely no talk of what the future will hold. We've got to work with it.' While doctors told her parents, Simone and Neil, that she would live life in a wheelchair and wouldn't ever crawl, Claudia defied everyone when she took her first steps when she was eight. 'The day our daughter took her first steps, my husband and I cried,' Mrs Doughty said. 'We were sitting on the lounge and she just stood up and did three flat steps. We were crying saying 'did that just happen?'. 'We danced around the kitchen hugging and bawling. It was a good day.' But they haven't all been good days, according to Mrs Doughty. 'There's been plenty of times in hospital where no one knows what's wrong with her and bad things happen,' Mrs Doughty said. Claudia was finally diagnosed with CDG1e two months ago and is the only recorded case in Australia . Her parents, Simone and Neil, first realised something was wrong when she started having serious seizures six months after she was born . Claudia can't talk or eat and she has major global developmental delays. She also only took her first steps two years ago, despite doctors saying she would never crawl . Since Claudia was born in March 2005, her parents have been back and forth to the hospital after she started having seizures at just six months. 'She had hideous seizures, like 100 different types a day. They were awful – all day, every day. It was scary, we had lots of crying time as a family,' she said. 'We ended up doing the ketogenic diet when she was three to try and control her seizures. But with Claudia, it was very unsuccessful and she stopped eating altogether. 'She never ate or drank another thing after that.' The family inched closer to Claudia's diagnosis after Mrs Doughty noticed her pinkie and thumb were the same size when she was cutting her nails. 'I told our metabolic specialist, who has been involved with Claudia for about five years, that she had these obscure long toes and funny little fingers,' she said. While doctors told her parents, Simone and Neil (pictured), that she would live life in a wheelchair and wouldn't ever crawl, Claudia defied everyone when she took her first steps when she was eight . The family inched closer to Claudia's diagnosis after Mrs Doughty noticed her pinkie and thumb were the same size when she was cutting her nails . Her parents say Claudia has a great sense of humour and she loves lights, water and loud music . A blood test that set the family back $3,000 notified them of a defective gene and two months ago the specialist finally confirmed Claudia's condition. 'The whole 10 year period of not knowing was heart-wrenching and traumatic,' Mrs Doughty said. 'For me, when we got the diagnosis I was elated. 'We fought for 10 long years of testing and frustration to receive our diagnoses for our darling daughter, only to realise that finally knowing her condition would be the tip of the iceberg.' Her parents are now trying to raise the funds to attend the second ever World CDG Conference in Lyon, France in August. 'As soon as we heard, we knew that, just as we had fought or so many years for a diagnosis for our daughter, we would fight to take her to that conference,' she said. 'It will be a truly priceless gift to be able to meet with specialists, doctors, parents and their kids to spread awareness and gain insight into such a rare disorder.'

"Bobbi Kristina Brown, left, and Nick Gordon pictured in 2012. Gordon has been barred by her father, Bobbi Brown, from seeing her in hospital until he reveals what happened before she was found unconscious in a bathtub on January 31 . Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend Nick Gordon has gone on another extraordinary Twitter rant against her father - claiming he has hardly seen the 21-year-old in years before her accident and is only interested in the family's money. The 22-year-old, who has reportedly been banned from visiting his comatose girlfriend in Emory University in Atlanta, told Bobby Brown to 'grow up' - insisting Whitney Houston's only daughter will hate him when she wakes up. The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before she was found face down in a bathtub. Gordon also insisted he has taken care of her '24/7' since her mother died in 2012. On Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown. The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.' He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her. 'Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.' The messages were quickly deleted from his profile, however he continued to shame Bobby Brown's parenting skills, heating up his feud with the family. He wrote: 'Crazy how all the Browns came to the hospital when this went down. I've been with her 24/7 watching over her and mom. Bobby left when it got heavy. Gordon then claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs. Before adding: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.' His followers quickly got involved in the conversation, some sharing messages of support and others were what he described as 'negative allegations' 'Listen at the end of all this I took care of Whitney Houston and Kriss which was very hard on someone my age' he wrote. 'They cried on my shoulders!!!!' Scroll down for video . Bobby Brown (pictured right earlier this month) said his daughter's boyfriend Nick Gordon (pictured left) has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital, where she remains in a medically-induced coma . 'Grow up': Gordon uploaded a screenshot of text messages he allegedly sent to Bobby Brown. In them he insisted Bobbi Kristina will hate her father when she wakes up . Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Ho . Parenting: Gordon accused Bobby Brown of virtually deserting his daughter during the rant . Referring to the night she was hospitalized, he said: 'My only regret is not getting to [Bobbi] faster to give CPR.' On Sunday, he posted: 'I can't wait till she wakes up and dismiss all of the negative thoughts. There is a reason why her mom made me promise to look after her.' Bobbi Kristina, the only daughter of the late Whitney Houston has been hospitalized in Atlanta since being found unresponsive on January 31 in a tub at her Georgia home. Police said Gordon was performing CPR when emergency responders arrived at the home. Gordon tweeted in anger on Saturday, saying he had been denied access to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend. 'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!' he tweeted on Saturday. Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in  for the last three weeks . Regrets: Referring to the night she was found face down in a bathtub, he told his followers he wishes he could have done more to save her. Police said they arrived and found him giving CPR . A lawyer for Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, said in a statement on Sunday that Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, was offered an opportunity to potentially visit her if he agreed to meet certain conditions. 'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe. At least not desperate enough to inform Bobby Brown, in writing, what happened to Bobbi Kristina,' attorney Christopher Brown told E!. But Gordon's attorneys said R&B singer Brown has consistently denied Gordon permission to visit. They said they advised Gordon not to agree to the conditions set by Brown. The conditions have not been made public. The attorneys said Gordon has repeatedly offered to discuss the issue privately with Brown. According to NBC, Brown's statement said that because Gordon had failed to spell out what happened to Bobbi Kristina, 'there is no reason for any additional discussion with him'. Reports have suggested Gordon may by the subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital. Nick Gordon, who has been frozen out by the family for weeks, insisted his presence will help the 21-year-old in this tweet on Saturday . Sources have claimed that Bobbi Kristina used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother Whitney Houston three years earlier (mother and daughter pictured together at a Grammys party in 2011) In his Saturday rant, Gordon also tweeted: 'If she hears MY voice let me massage her, play her favorite music I believe it will help. If you ask Bobby anything abt [sic] he cannot answer.' He posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo of Bobbi Kristina's name on his arm alongside the message: 'Healing fine just like my baby.' Last Wednesday, Gordon's lawyer Randall Kessler said his client 'desperately wants to be with the one he loves'. Gordon's efforts to see Bobbi Kristina have been blocked by the family claimed Kessler, with relatives of Bobby Brown threatening to lay 'hands on him' if he showed up. Kessler said: '[Nick] has respected the family's wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation… He continues to hope that his request will be granted.' Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. A new report which surfaced on Saturday claimed that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'. She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital last month after being found by  Gordon. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Last week, she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. Gordon reportedly has become the main focus in a criminal investigation by police in Roswell, Georgia. Prior to being hospitalized, Bobbi Kristina had been in a car crash, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said. One of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.","The 22-year-old year old took to social media to vent growing frustration .

"The coffin of a revered Turkish historical figure has been given a new resting place, after the country sent hundreds of soldiers into Syria to prise it from the grip of Islamic State militants. Soldiers re-interred the remains of Suleyman Shah, whose grandson Osman I founded the Ottoman Empire in the 12th Century, after yesterday evacuating it from Aleppo Province. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan today denied the move was a retreat, instead calling it 'a temporary move in order not to risk soldiers' lives,' after militants threatened to attack the tomb. Scroll down for video . Solemn: Turkish soldiers stand to attention during a ceremony marking the relocation of the coffins brought from the Tomb of Suleyman Shah to a temporary position near Sanliurfa, south-east of Turkey . Revered: Soldiers stand guard outside the building where the coffins will be housed. Suleyman Shah was the grandfather of Osman I, the 12th century founder of the Ottoman Empire . Controversial: A digger works near a Turkish flag flying inside of Syria, at the new location for the tomb . Nearly 600 Turkish soldiers and 100 armoured vehicles entered Syria to evacuate the crypt and the men guarding it, in an act Syria denounced as 'flagrant aggression'. Although the tomb is located 25 miles away from the frontier, Turkey regards it as sovereign territory and Turkish soldiers had been guarding it since the start of  Syria's civil war. Its location, in Karakozak village, north-east of Aleppo, had been surrounded by ISIS fighters. Suleyman's remains were relocated to a spot just a few hundred feet from the border, on a patch of high ground visible from Turkey. The Syrian government last night said it would hold Ankara responsible for any repercussions from what it called an act of 'flagrant aggression'. Damascus said the Turkish government had informed the Syrian consulate in Istanbul about the operation to relocate the tomb, but had not awaited Syria's agreement. A statement on Syrian television said the fact Islamic State militants had not attacked the tomb 'confirmed the depth of the ties between the Turkish government and this terrorist organisation'. Safe return: Turkish tanks drive through Kobane on their way back to Turkey after the evacuation . Show of force: The military operation involved around 100 tanks and 600 soldiers . Anger: The Syrian government denounced Turkey's move as an act of 'flagrant aggression' A Turkish soldier gives a thumbs up from the top of an army vehicle in a street in Kobane . The overnight operation to secure Suleyman's remains was split in two, with one group crossing into Syria to reach the tomb to repatriate the soldiers and extract the remains of Suleyman Shah . A second group took control of an area just 650 feet from the Turkish border where authorities planned to move the tomb, Turkish media reported. Turkish tanks late on Saturday sped through the shattered streets of Kobane - the city now controlled by Kurdish fighters after a months long battle with jihadists - on their way to the tomb. In a hugely symbolic move, the troops also raised their flag over a new area of raised ground inside Syria but easily visible from the Turkish border. Images taken from the border indicated that this spot in the in the Syrian district of Eshme was the location of Suleyman's new tomb. Highest political authority: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, centre, in shirtsleeves, follows the all-night operation on video link from Turkish General Staff Headquarters, in Ankara, Turkey . Operations room: A military official points out details on a screen for the benefit of Mr Davotoglu . Hi-tech: The operation is viewed by drone and the view projected at Turkish General Staff Headquarters . There were reportedly 40 Turkish soldiers guarding the mausoleum complex by the Euphrates River, which under a 1920s treaty is considered sovereign Turkish territory. It carries huge symbolic importance to Turks as a link to their pre-Ottoman past. After taking everything of historical value, the Turkish troops detonated the building that housed the tomb so it was not misused afterwards by jihadists, Turkish media said. One soldier was killed in an accident during the operation, Prime Minister Davutoglu said. 'We had given the Turkish armed forces a directive to protect our spiritual values and the safety of our armed forces personnel,' Mr Davutoglu said in televised remarks. Mr Davutoglu said on Twitter that the remains of Suleyman would be moved to a different area of Syria which had been brought under Turkish military control. He said that 572 Turkish soldiers using 39 tanks, 57 armoured vehicles and 100 other military vehicles took part in the operation. A government official said that warning shots had been fired to prevent any danger from IS. Moving in: Turkish army vehicles drive through Kobane, during the operation to retrieve the garrison guarding the Suleyman Shah mausoleum in northern Syria . Breaking ground: Turkish soldiers put a wire fence around area after Turkish flag is raised  in the Esme region of Aleppo where the Tomb of Suleyman Shah will be placed . Standing guard: Turkish soldiers protect at the new location as the Turkish Army launched a military operation into Syria to evacuate soldiers guarding Tomb of Suleyman Shah . Announcing the operation to the Turkish public, President Erdogan said: 'Our flag will continue to fly in a new place to keep alive the memory of our ancestors.' The figure of Suleyman helps Turks link the Ottoman dynasty, which according to tradition was founded by Osman in 1299, with the early Turkic tribes who swept through Anatolia from Asia. 'A nation cannot build a future without a past and symbols of the past,' said Mr Davutoglu. The operation was launched 11 months after ISIS militants threatened to launch an attack on the tomb unless Turkey removed its troops within three days. At the time, the Turkish government responded that any attack on the location of the tomb would be considered an attack on Turkish soil. It is not the first time the tomb has been relocated - it was moved in the 1970s when its then location, also on the Euphrates, was flooded by the Syrian authorities to construct the Tabqa Dam that forms Lake Assad. The tomb had for years been watched over largely by conscripts but in March 2014 Turkey reportedly sent several dozen special forces to guard it. Returning: Turkish soldiers stand guard at the entrance of the memorial site of Suleyman Shah, grandfather of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire, in Karakozak village, northeast of Aleppo, Syria . Incoming: Nearly 600 troops and 100 tanks and were involved in the operation to extract soldiers guarding the crypt and to move it to a new location, . The sun rises as Turkish troops stand guard over what is set to become a new Turkish enclave in Syria . Turkic leader Suleyman Shah was born circa 1178, and was the grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire. He is believed to have drowned in the Euphrates around 1236. His followers headed north into what is today Turkey, where they launched the Ottoman Empire. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I, a treaty was signed between Turkey and France, then the colonial power in Syria. The 1921 Treaty of Ankara assigned an area of 8,000 sq.m. north-east of Aleppo, containing the tomb, to remain Turkish territory. The location of the tomb was flooded in 1973 due to the building of a new dam, and Turkey moved the mausoleum. Some historians question official accounts about the Shah's tomb, saying they might have been retrospectively concocted to enrich an imperial identity for Turks. The operation to evacuate the soldiers guarding the tomb took place as Turkey comes under pressure from its Western allies to play a greater role in the fight against IS jihadists. The U.S. and Turkey on Thursday signed a deal to train and equip thousands of moderate Syrian rebel forces opposing Assad after several weeks of talks. Turkey's opposition angrily lashed out at the government over the operation, accusing it of dressing up a military withdrawal as a victory. 'For the first time in the history of the Turkish Republic, we are losing territory without fighting for it,' said Gursel Tekin of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). Kobane was the focus of U.S. airstrikes as Kurdish forces battled militants of the Islamic State group, who hold about a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in their self-declared caliphate. Turkey stayed out of the battle at the time, which saw Kurds ultimately push out the extremists. The U.S.-led coalition forces were informed of the Turkish operation after its launch to prevent any casualties, Mr Davutoglu said. U.S. officials offered no immediate comment.","Remains of Suleyman Shah re-interred at spot 200m from Turkish border .

"The North Sea has been devouring the fields, roads and even villages of the East Yorkshire coast for hundreds of years and its inexorable advance has become a fact of life for seaside residents. Now it is predicted that hundreds of homes will disappear in the area over the next century, as more properties fall victim to the rampant coastal erosion attacking the coastline. More than 200 homes are predicted to slip over the cliff edges between Flamborough Head, near Bridlington, and Spurn Point, 45 miles further south, in the next 100 years. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of homes will disappear into the North Sea over the next century, as more properties fall victim to the rampant coastal erosion attacking the coastline. Pictured: The coastal road, south of Bridlington . More than 200 homes are predicted to slip over cliff edges between Flamborough Head, near Bridlington, and Spurn Point, 45 miles further south. Pictured: Coastal road between Ulrome and Skipsea . Meanwhile, people living in the Skipsea area are expecting around 20 homes in their village alone to disappear in the next few years. Skipsea residents have had to get used to an ever-changing cliff-top landscape littered with abruptly ending roads, doomed buildings and the half-remnants of once-loved gardens. The policy so far on the East Yorkshire coast has been to concentrate sea-defence funding on 'hard-points'. These are the larger communities, such as Withernsea, and strategic facilities, such as the Easington gas terminal. Given the huge cost of such defences, the most cost-effective solution for the rest of the seafront has been to let the inevitable happen. Around 30 villages have completely disappeared into the North Sea since Roman times including places like Hyde, Withow and Cleeton which are now under the waves more than a mile off Skipsea . Given the huge cost of such defences, the most cost-effective solution for the rest of the seafront has been to let the inevitable happen . The coastline has moved around 12 miles in the last 10,000 years and currently retreats at an average of up to two metres a year . The coastline has moved around 12 miles in the last 10,000 years and currently retreats at an average of up to two metres a year. This varies from location to location, though, and yearly losses of more than 18m in some places are not unknown. Around 30 villages have completely disappeared into the North Sea since Roman times including places like Hyde, Withow and Cleeton which are now under the waves more than a mile off Skipsea. Environment Agency information uncovered  last year suggested 7,000 homes would disappear due to coastal erosion in England and Wales over the next 100 years. Houses on the east coast close to Skipsea in East Yorkshire, pictured in 2007. Nearly 7,000 properties in England and Wales will be allowed to fall into the sea this century . A house falls over dunes into the sea after storm damage at Hemsby in Norfolk in December 2013, following the 'most serious' tidal surge to hit the east coast of Britain for 60 years . Severe storms in December 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England - and at Hemsby (pictured) in Norfolk, coastal erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea . More than 800 of these properties will go in the next 20 years, and homeowners living in them now face the prospect of being forced to move to a safer area with no compensation scheme in place. The most at-risk area in the next two decades was said to be Cornwall, with 76 properties expected to be lost. And three local authority areas are forecast to lose more than 250 properties each when looking a century ahead. These include Great Yarmouth (293), Southampton (280) and Cornwall (273). In December 2013, severe storms saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England. The tidal surge which hit the east coast was described as the ‘most serious’ for 60 years. This three-bedroom bungalow with views over the North Sea in Happisburgh, Norfolk, was bought for £20,000 in 1987 - and the Daily Mail reported in 2008 how it was worth £1. The owners left in 2011 . A house that was bought for a knock-down price in Torquay, Devon, fell into the sea in April 2013 - three years after Sue Diamond paid £154,000 for it . Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes as tides in the North Sea reached higher levels than the 1953 floods. Two people died - in West Lothian and Nottinghamshire. At Hemsby in Norfolk, cliff erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea. Coastal community campaigners claim that the Government should do more to help residents living in vulnerable areas move elsewhere, if it cannot defend their properties. The Government has said it will have spent more than £3.2bn over the course of this Parliament on flood management and protection from coastal erosion. It says this has led to better protection for an additional 15,000 houses.","200 homes predicted to disappear on East Yorkshire cliffs near Bridlington .

"A 94-year-old man alleged to have worked as a medic in Auschwitz has been charged with 3,681 counts of accessory to murder because prosecutors say his actions would have enabled the death camp to keep running. Schwerin prosecutors' spokesman Stefan Urbanek said today the suspect was a former SS sergeant who served in an SS hospital at the Nazi death camp in occupied Poland. Urbanek said through this role the man helped the extermination camp to function and he can therefore be charged as an accessory to the brutal killings. Schwerin prosecutors' spokesman Stefan Urbanek said today the suspect was a former SS sergeant who served in an SS hospital in the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland (pictured) Urbanek would not release the suspect's name in line with privacy laws. The man is one of 30 people under investigation because they are suspected to have held roles in Auschwitz during the Second World War. Federal investigators recommended back in 2013 that state prosecutors pursue charges against them under a new precedent in German law. The man's attorney, Peter-Michael Diestel, told the Bild newspaper there's no evidence of any 'concrete criminal act' by his client. The man is one of 30 under investigation because they are suspected to have held roles in Auschwitz . Officials say the man helped the extermination camp to function and he can therefore be charged as an accessory to the brutal killings - 1.1 million people are believed to have been murdered at the camp . The arrest comes less than a week after a 93-year-old man was charged with 170,000 counts of accessory to murder on allegations he served as an SS guard at  Auschwitz. The defendant allegedly served in Auschwitz between January 1942 to June 1944, the Detmold state court said last week. It is claimed this second man was assigned to the Auschwitz I camp but also helped supervise new prisoners, largely Jews, as they arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau - the part of the camp where most of its 1.1million victims were killed. Last year Oskar Groening (pictured in SS uniform) was charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role as a guard at the camp . Defense attorney Johannes Salmen said his client has acknowledged being at Auschwitz I, but denies being assigned to Birkenau or being involved in killings. The North-Rhine Westphalia centre said the accused was deployed to the Nazi death camp in January 1942. While there it is alleged he worked as a member of the SS Death's Head guard battalion and was responsible for guarding trains of Jews arriving at the death camp. He is also alleged to have worked in 'selection', which involved marking newly-arrived inmates for immediate death or sending them to work. Last year Oskar Groening, also aged 93, was charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role as a guard at the camp. The sergeant worked at Auschwitz for two-and-a-half years and was charged with sorting the possessions of the inmates and collecting and tallying any money that was on them. At least 1.1 million prisoners died at Auschwitz, around 90 per cent of them Jewish. In one period between May and June 1944, 425,000 Hungarian Jews were sent there - around 300,000 were immediately sent to the gas chambers. He was never punished after the war because a tribunal cleared him of involvement in 1948. But Groening has openly talked about his time as a guard and said while he witnessed horrific atrocities, he didn't commit any crimes himself. In 2005, he told Der Spiegel magazine he recalled one incident on 'ramp duty' when he heard a baby crying. 'I saw another SS soldier grab the baby by the legs,' he said. 'He smashed the baby's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent.'","Pensioner has been charged with 3,681 counts of accessory to murder .

"A man who shone a laser into the cockpit of police helicopter dazzling the pilot with a light so bright it could have caused it to crash and kill the crew on board has been jailed. Andrew Paul Holden, 47, was branded 'stupid and selfish' by police officers after he shone the laser beam at the National Police Air Service (NPAS) helicopter as it flew over Radcliffe in Greater Manchester. Images of the bright green light seen by the officers show the dangerous 'bloom effect' it creates - easily dazzling the crew with potential catastrophic consequences. Andrew Paul Holden has been jailed after he shone a laser pen into the cockpit of a police helicopter . Officers on the ground were guided to Holden's home in Radcliffe, Bury, by the crew on board the helicopter and were arrested him. The helicopter had to abandon the job it had been called out to in Radcliffe because of the incident. Holden pleaded guilty to endangering an aircraft and was sentenced to six months in prison. The incident took place on October 13 last year when the laser was fired into the cockpit. Holden had previously claimed he didn't target the helicopter intentionally. The pilot on the flight, Captain Robert Grainger, said: 'The consequences of targeting an aircraft can be horrendous. 'During this incident I had to ensure the safety of my passengers, the general public and myself, whilst being disorientated by the intense light. Holden was tracked by officers and arrested at home . 'Luckily this incident didn't result in any injuries, but it could quite easily have ended in fatalities. 'Sadly, and frustratingly, this is not a one off event. I hope that the sentence handed down reflects the severity of such foolish and reckless actions and will serve as a deterrent to others.' The helicopter is equipped with technology which makes it able to track individuals and help with search operations. Tactical Flight Officer, Pc Andy Shaw, said: 'As a result of one person's stupid and selfish actions we had to stop our original tasking, meaning the valuable resource of the NPAS helicopter was taken away from supporting officers on the ground. 'Fortunately, on this occasion it didn't greatly impact on the incident we were dealing with or have any significant impact on the public, but we could have been involved in an incident whereby someone's life was in danger. 'Additionally shining a laser into a helicopter could have itself had catastrophic consequences.' A number of people have been convicted of targeting police helicopters with laser pens to dazzle them, creating dangerous risks for those on board. People who are targeted with the lasers can also suffer eye damage. Last October Chris Vowles targeted the National Police Air Service (NPAS) four times with a laser while he was drinking in his garden below the plane with his friends in Birmingham. Holden, 47, was branded 'stupid and selfish' for the incident in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester . Police said shining a laser pen into a cockpit can have potentially fatal consequences for the crew . Police tracked Vowles using thermal imaging equipment so he could be arrested. The 23-year-old TK Maxx worker admitted targeting the helicopter and was sentenced to seven years in prison, suspended for two years. And last November 23-year-old William Sprout, from Warrington, was jailed for up to four months after beaming a laser at a police helicopter from the window of his flat. Police said they take the practice of deliberately targeting helicopters with laser pens very seriously. The lasers can create a 'bloom effect', with a large burst of light dazzling pilots who are in danger of losing control. People have lasers shone into their eyes can suffer eye damage. It's not just police helicopters that are targeted with laser pens. In January last year the RAF revealed its planes had been targeted 262 times in five years. Some of the incidents reported by the military included people shining the lasers into the cockpits of planes carrying injured personnel. The planes were targeted as they descended below 5,000ft on their final approach to Birmingham Airport to take soldiers for treatment at the city's state-of-the-art Queen Elizabeth Hospital. RAF officers have warned that the practice plays 'Russian roulette' with the lives of pilots and those on board, while police have warned of the potentially disastrous consequences. Aviation officials issued a plea in December for people to stop shining lasers into the eyes of pilots as they prepare to land, after 100 incidents were recorded at Liverpool John Lennon airport in just two years. There were more reports of pilots being targeted at Liverpool than at London Stansted and Edinburgh. Shining a laser at an aircraft in flight became a criminal offence in 2010, and carries a fine of up to £2,500. Recklessly endangering an aircraft is punishable by up to five years in jail. The pens can be bought for as little as £8.","Andrew Paul Holden shone a laser pen into the cockpit of police helicopter .

"Most caterpillars tend to rely upon camouflage or being as unpalatable as possible to protect themselves from predators, but the Eastern tiger swallowtail has a more unusual approach - it pretends to be a smelly snake. The caterpillar of the Eastern tiger swallowtail, which is native to North America, has two green 'eyespots' on the top of its body that makes it look like a snake slithering between the leaves. Incredibly, when disturbed the insect larvae shoots out two bright orange structures that look like the forked tongue of a snake. Scroll down for a video . The Eastern tiger swallowtail pushes out a protrusion that looks like a snake's forked tongue (shown above) And as if resembling a potentially dangerous reptile was not enough to put off hungry birds, the caterpillar has another weapon in its armory. Having bright colours and distinguishing features is a common way for insects to scare away predators like birds. Often they help to lure them away from vital body parts or confuse them. However, this only works on predators that hunt using sight while bats tend to be immune to such devices. Now scientists have found that a moth has an unusual evolutionary adaptation that allows it to confuse the ultrasound used by bats. The luna moth has two tails that extend for more than an inch beyond its body. Scientists in the US showed that these appendages produce a confusing acoustic signature in the bats echolocation. It makes the bats target the end of the tails rather than the moth itself. Pushing out the orange tongue-like structure - known as an osmeterium - releases a powerful and smelly substance at the same time. Now scientists have found evidence hidden in the genome of these strange butterflies that helps explain how they developed this in the first place. The foul-smelling substance consists of chemicals called terpenes, which are created by enzymes in the caterpillar's body. Most butterflies have just one or two of these enzymes, but the Eastern tiger swallowtail and its relatives, known as Papilio butterflies, appear to have many. Writing in the journal Cell Reports, Dr Nick Grishin, a geneticist at University of Texas, said these butterflies exist appear to have broken off from the main branch of the butterfly evolutionary tree. He said: 'The Papilio-specific FPPS enzymes form a clade in the evolutionary tree. 'We hypothesized that they could function in a pathway to synthesize predator-repelling terpenes secreted by the osmeterium, a Papilionidae-specific organ among butterflies.' The researchers used a rapid and cheap DNA sequencing technique to assess the genome of the Eastern tiger swallowtail. The Eastern tiger swallowtail caterpillar also has distinctive eyespots (pictured) that make it look like a snake . By looking like a green snake, like Opheodrys vernalis above, the caterpillar is able to frighten off predators . The geneticists also found that the butterflies appear to produce more molecules that are sensitive to green, blue and ultraviolet light. This, they say, 'may indicate a more advanced colour perception'. They also found that the butterflies have mutations in proteins that are responsible for the circadian rhythm - the internal clock that works in cells. This, they say, might explain why Eastern tiger swallowtails mature quickly into adults and hatch from their chrysalises quickly compared to their cousins, the Canadian tiger swallowtails, which sleep through the winter. The scientists also found the Eastern tiger swallowtails had high numbers of proteins involved in the detection of chemicals from their food. Other species of Papilio butterfly, like the black swallowtail above, also use osmeterium to look like snakes . Dr Grishin and his colleagues added: 'They are also significantly enriched in proteins involved in the detection of stimuli (chemosensory ionotropic receptors), which may be related to the wide range of food plants they feed on.' The butterfly's genome was found to be 376 million bases, or 'letters' of DNA, long. The human genome consists of 3.2 billion bases. Dr Grishin said that with the technique they have developed, it may be possible to cheaply sequence the DNA of insects to identify them. He said: 'With our protocols, the cost per new genome falls below $4,000, making insect sequencing projects feasible. 'We think the power of comparative genomics can be fully exploited only when there are thousands of genomes available.' Despite the fearsome appearance of its caterpillar, the adult Eastern tiger swallowtail (above) is beautiful .","The Eastern tiger swallowtail is native to the east coast of North America .

"The death toll from crashes involving General Motors cars with defective ignition switches has climbed to 57. The total is one more than last week. It was posted Monday on an Internet site by compensation expert Kenneth Feinberg. Feinberg and his aides are checking claims filed or postmarked before a Jan. 31 deadline to determine which are eligible for compensation. Death Toll: The death toll from crashes involving General Motors cars with defective ignition switches has climbed to 57 (photographed is a key in the ignition switch of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt) Each eligible death claim is worth at least $1 million under his guidelines. Feinberg was hired by GM to make payments. Las year, GM set up a $400 million fund to make the payments and turned it over to Feinberg, USA Today reports. Feinberg decides who receives compensation and how much. As of Friday, he received 479 death claims and 3,866 injury claims. Of the injury claims, 94 will get compensation, up from 87 a week ago, according to the GM Ignition Compensation Compensation Claims Resolution Facility. Claims: Nearly 500 death claims have been reported to GM as a result of the faulty ignition (photographed) Feinberg has received a total of 4,345 claims, up 33 from the 4,312 filed as of Feb. 13. Of the claims filed by Friday, 666 were deemed ineligible and 151 are eligible for payments. Feinberg is reviewing or seeking documents for the rest. The total number of claims could rise slightly, said Camille Biros, the fund's deputy administrator. A few claims arrived since Friday, and Feinberg's office is verifying that they were postmarked before the Jan. 31 deadline, she said. Detroit-based GM was aware of faulty ignition switches on Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars for more than a decade, but it didn't recall them until 2014. Faulty: Here, Jeff Herrington (center) holds a picture of his daughter Brandee, who was killed in a 2010 car crash in a GM car with a faulty ignition switch . Victims: Amber Rose (left) died in a car crash in 2005 in what is said to be the first death linked to the faulty ignition switch, Natasha Weigel (center) and Amy Rademaker (right) both died in October 2006 following a crash due to the defect . On 2.6 million cars worldwide, the switches can slip out of the 'on' position, causing the vehicles to stall, knocking out power steering and turning off the air bags. Fienberg's office has said that it likely will take until late spring to sort through all of the claims it has received. Those who agree to payments give up their right to sue the automaker. Blame: Gene Mikale Erikson (left) died in a car crash in 2004 and his fiance, Candice Anderson, sued GM after pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide claiming the switch defect was to blame . Though the fund initially contained $400 million, GM conceded that could grow to $600 million. Feinberg has said GM has placed no cap on the amount of money he can spend. At the end of last year, Feinberg had paid out $93 million in claims, according to GM's annual report. GM still faces 104 wrongful death and injury lawsuits due to the faulty ignition switches, as well as 108 class-action lawsuits alleging that the ignition switch debacle reduced the value of customers' cars and trucks.","The death toll from crashes involving General Motors cars with defective ignition switches has climbed to 57 .

He made a speech as First Lady Michelle, who dazzled in sparkling dress and set of necklaces, sat beside him. 'Within this room, we're not going to agree on everything. But I am committed to working with each and every one of you over the next two years to keep making progress,' he said. 'And we'll talk more about that tomorrow.' Scroll down for video . Glamorous First Lady Michelle Obama dazzled as she sat beside her husband during the annual White House Governor's dinner . Support: She watched as her husband made a speech, telling the nation's governors he was prepared to work with them for the last two years of his term . Raising a glass: President Barack Obama makes a toast during the evening. He promised the politicians a good time, but apologized that he would not conjure up Governor Schwarzenegger . On a lighter note, he made reference to the former of Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his appearance at a previous event during his remarks. He said: 'We promise a good time. The only thing we can't conjure up from the past is Governor Schwarzenegger on the dance floor. It was something. Among the attendees were politician' who will be vying for Obama's job in 2016, including Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. The Republican took the opportunity to capture a selfie with his son Alex in the corridors of the White House before they sat down to eat. Walker caused a stir on Saturday when he said he didn't know whether the president loves America. He was responding to a question about similar comments earlier in the week by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Son selfie: Governor and potential presidential candidate Scott Walker posed for a picture alongside his son Alex before the dinner in the White House . During the winter meeting, governors warned that millions could lose ose health insurance subsidies in the coming months if the Supreme Court sides with opponents of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul . He shook hands with National Governors Association Chairman, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, after he made his remarks . The former mayor claimed at event attended by Walker that Obama doesn't love America — a comment that has drawn criticism from Democrats and put some GOP presidential hopefuls on the spot. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, the NGA's chair, also spoke and called the dinner 'a wonderful and rare opportunity for us to come together and genuinely share each other's company.' He also praised Obama for visiting his state during several recent tragedies, and specifically commended his compassion. 'I can personally say with the deepest respect and appreciation, thank you for the love — thank you for your love for the people of Colorado and of all our states.' Obama made brief reference to the presidential jockeying by several governors at the beginning of his remarks. 'Harry Truman once called the presidency an 'enlarged governorship',' he said to laughs. 'Of course, a few of you are hoping that he was right.' Obama also made a brief reference to presidential jockeying ob several gorvernors. He said: 'Harry Truman once called the presidency an 'enlarged governorship'. Of course, a few of you are hoping that he was right' Hickenlooper, the NGA's chair, also spoke and called the dinner 'a wonderful and rare opportunity for us to come together and genuinely share each other's company.' During the winter meeting, some of the politicians warned that millions of people could lose health insurance subsidies in the coming months if the Supreme Court sides with Obama's health care overhaul. And one thing was clear this weekend as the nation's governors gathered in Washington: Many of the states that could be affected are not prepared for the potential fallout. In rounds of interviews at the National Governors Association's winter meeting, several governors indicated they could do little about the estimated 8 million people who could drop coverage if they were to lose health insurance subsidies later this year — a scenario that legal experts suggest is a real possibility. While preliminary state-level discussions have begun in some cases, many governors charged that Congress should bear the burden of fixing any problems. Governor Walker said: 'That responsibility doesn't fall in the hands of the states or the governors, it falls in the hands of the leaders right here in Washington.' Indeed, while the Supreme Court deemed the health care overhaul constitutional more than two years ago, the Affordable Care Act still sits on shifting political sands. The Supreme Court will hear arguments March 4 on whether the health care law allows the federal government to pay subsidies in states that declined to set up their own insurance markets, or exchanges. For many Americans, the subsidies make the insurance affordable. More than 30 states — largely those led by Republicans — declined to set up state-based systems and have exchanges run by the federal government instead. 'We declined to operate a state exchange along with a majority of other states,' said Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican who is also weighing a 2016 White House run and supports the repeal of the health care law. 'Right now we're just evaluating what our options are depending on what the Supreme Court decides.' Coverage losses would be concentrated largely in Republican-led states across the South and Midwest that have resisted the law, among them Florida, Maine, North Carolina, Michigan, Texas, Virginia and New Jersey. Residents of states that are running their own markets, including California and New York, would continue to receive benefits. He made his remarks during a painting of one of his predecessors, Abraham Lincoln . While few governors offered specific remedies this weekend, some governors in unaffected states signaled a willingness to allow neighboring states to join their exchanges, although the governors interviewed were unclear if such partnerships were permitted under the new law. 'I'm very interested in the concept. If we can work together with Utah and the other neighboring states that could work out well,' said Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican whose state has its own exchange and won't be affected. Most of his colleagues aren't as confident. 'Nobody is quite sure what's going to happen,' said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, who said leaders in his state believe they have until June 30 to put together contingency plans for an estimated 270,000 Virginians who may lose subsidies. 'We're having conversations,' said New Hampshire's Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, whose state is among nine that have a hybrid state-federal partnership. She said around 30,000 New Hampshire residents currently receive health care subsidies, while another 34,000 on Medicaid, set to be moved into the exchange next year, could also be affected. 'It's a significant issue,' she said. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, predicted the chances of the Supreme Court striking down the subsidies are 'maybe 50-50.' 'My expectation is that they'll give us some time to adjust,' Herbert said, noting that he's already spoken to House Speaker John Boehner about his concerns. The ruling is expected in late June. If the court agrees with the law's opponents, the federal government and states would have little time for federal government and states to address the loss of subsidies. The health law's 2016 sign-up season would be only months away. And most state legislatures are not in session during the summer. Technically, a few tweaks from Congress would fix the problem. But after years of voting to repeal the health care law, Republicans are unlikely to come to its rescue. 'We're afraid there'll be another Washington standoff, and the hot potato comes back into our lap,' said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, who said as many as 250,000 Tennessee residents could lose subsidies. 'You have governors of all types watching with a lot of interest.'

"The Google search engine is a powerful and sophisticated tool, but a group of internet pranksters exploited a weak spot and persuaded it that a picture of a potato was in fact an Xbox. A mischievous Reddit user started a thread that contained a picture of a potato and the caption ‘Gaming Console’, along with the instruction to other users to vote on it to make Google’s news algorithms believe that it’s found something true and relevant.

After several thousand votes, the thread, posted by user DannyonPC, succeeded and a picture of the potato appeared in the news search results for ‘Gaming Console’. The prank emerged from a Reddit sub-channel called subreddit r/circlejerk, where users constantly try to exploit the power of the site to fool Google.

"Defeat: Eureka Naturist Spa Club, pictured, has  to remove eight static caravans for 'sleepovers' A naturist club which is popular with swingers has been ordered to remove caravans used for 'sleepovers' by nudist guests after neighbours complained that those staying in them were making too much noise. Eureka Naturist Spa Club, in the sleepy Kent village of Fawkham, currently has eight static caravans which it hires out for £50 a night to nudists visiting from around the UK and Europe. But now the local council has ruled that the structures were put up without planning permission and must be removed. The club, which holds weekly parties attended with local swingers, is situated on 23 acres of land in the grounds of Pennis Wood. As well as the party nights, Eureka - founded in 1967 - offers visitors naked wrestling, swimming in a heated pool, body painting, badminton, football and nude rambling in the forest. The club also has two eight-person jacuzzis, a sauna and a steam room, while its party room contains a dance floor and space for 180 people at its 'exciting and hedonistic' parties. Guests are told they can strip naked as soon as they reach the car park, as the club is officially 'clothing-optional'. But Lawrence Moss, the chair of Fawkham Parish Council, said that the club's caravans were a major 'noise nuisance' problem for neighbours. 'Because the parties go on to the early hours, there's considerable potential for people living nearby to have problems,' he said. 'There have been complaints of excess noise and passers-by being exposed to naked people.' Visit: Guests are told they can remove their clothes as soon as they reach the car park of the club . The parish council complained that the accommodation was 'out of character' for the area, and last week Sevenoaks District Council ruled that they should be removed. Chief planning officer Richard Morris said the caravans constituted an 'inappropriate development in the Green Belt', adding that they 'detracted from the rural setting and natural character of the ancient woodland'. Local Simon Sullivan said: 'The nudist club has been here for years and there aren't too many problems really, although it's a bit of a shock when you meet a bunch of naked people wandering around the woods. 'I think it's a case of each to their own, but some people in the village get quite annoyed about the noise and when people stay over obviously the noise goes on a bit longer. I dare say the caravans are rocking all night, but I've never been invited!' Picturesque: The club is set in 23 acres of woodland near the sleepy village of Fawkham in Kent . The club's boss Michael Davies admitted the caravans did not have planning permission, but said they had been in place for more than 20 years without any problems. He added: 'We just want to keep the static caravans for our members to stay in rather than having to drive home. 'It's a niche market so we get people coming from all over the place - from Portsmouth, Norfolk, Scotland, even France and Holland.' A spokesman for the club said it would appeal against the decision, adding: 'The club has a number of members who travel long distances to attend meetings and events held by the club, and small-scale provision of overnight accommodation allows members to relax and enjoy an alcoholic drink without any concerns of irresponsible late-night travelling.'","Eureka Naturist Spa Club hires out static caravans for £50 a night .

"The helpless blind puppy dumped at a motorway service station has had his vet bills well and truly covered – thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers. The terrified animal – thought to be an eight-week-old miniature Shetland sheepdog – was found cowering in the ladies’ toilets by a shop worker earlier this month. Nearly £2,000 has been raised since his story moved dog-lovers across the country, and yesterday his rescuer thanked everyone who had donated to the appeal. Scroll down for video . Cute: The miniature Shetland sheepdog was discovered in the ladies toilets at a service station in Sandbach, Cheshire. Vets will carry out tests to see if his sight can be restored . Curled up and shaking in fear, the tiny scrap of fur was found by a shop worker at Roadchef Services at Sandbach on the M6 in Cheshire earlier this month. His owner, who has not been traced, is thought to have dumped the puppy – believed to be a miniature Shetland sheepdog aged eight-to-ten weeks – after discovering he was blind. Staff wrapped him in a blanket and gave him some water, and he has now been adopted by maintenance manager Ian Schofield. Colleagues and motorists using the services have been voting to pick a name, in exchange for a donation to charity – with the result due to be announced this week, the overwhelming frontrunner is Louie, after the loo beside which he was found. But with a consultation with a vet specialising in eye problems costing £300 alone, on top of routine jabs, staff also set up an online appeal for help with the bills. On Friday, the total stood at £540, but following publicity in the Mail it had yesterday reached £2,375. Eileen Garner, who pledged £10, wrote: ‘Can’t print what I think of anyone who would do this to such a gorgeous puppy. He’s better off without them.’ Linda Dickson, who gave £20, commented: ‘It broke my heart that anyone could do that. Little puppy must have been so frightened especially as she is blind. Thank goodness for the wonderful people at Sandbach services.’ And Karen Dedman, who gave £20, said: ‘Thank you for taking care of this beautiful dog. Here is a little something to help you with the vet fees.’ Abandoned: The dog, nicknamed Louie by customers, was found in the toilets at a service station in Sandbach, Cheshire . In a message to everyone who had contributed, Mr Schofield wrote: ‘I am overwhelmed by everybody’s generosity and kind words regarding the little one. ‘It has astonished me that there are so many caring people out there.’ He said the puppy was settling in well at his home, with his other dog, a terrier named Belle, acting as his eyes and ears and ‘barking instructions’. If the puppy’s eyesight cannot be restored and there is a sizeable excess in funds, staff are expected to donate the money to another dog-related cause.

"A young boy with a huge right foot has baffled hundreds of doctors who have no idea how to treat his condition. Verdant Joshi's limb measures a shocking 11 inches and weighs 12lbs (5.4 kg) - the same as a bowling ball or a sack of potatoes. The four-year-old, from Gujarat, western India, has been bullied all his life because of his conditiom- although he can walk and run normally. Many doctors have suggested the foot should be amputated, while others say the condition is not life-threatening. Verdant Joshi, four, was born with a giant right leg and a foot that now measures 11 inches and weighs 12lbs (5.4kg), the same as a bowling ball or sack of potatoes . He has been examined by hundreds of doctors from India and abroad, who have suggested he could be suffering from conditions ranging from water retention to a hormone imbalance. However none have been able to recommend treatment . Many doctors have suggested his right leg should be amputated, but as he can run and walk normally, his father Dilip Joshi,  wants to avoid this as it would Verdant for life . Now, his father is desperate for a doctor in some corner of the world to treat his son's big foot so he can avoid amputation, which would disable him for the rest of his life. Verdant said his foot means he is ostracised from other children, who make fun of him. He said: 'Children laugh at me for not running fast. 'They don't ask me to play cricket or football, even if I tell them I can run. I want to go to school but teachers have told my father I can't go.' Instead, Verdant is confined to his two-room house where he plays with his mother Jayshree Joshi, 26, and his one-year-old sister Vrisha. His desperate parents have taken him to more than 100 doctors over the last four years but most have been baffled by his condition. Despite examining his foot several times and taking blood, sweat and saliva samples they have failed to diagnose the problem. Visiting doctors from America, Mumbai, Udaipur and Chennai have even examined Vedant but none could diagnose his condition. His father Dilip Kumar Joshi, 30, said: 'I've tried every field of medical science, from homeopath, allopath, orthopedic specialists, bone specialists and skin specialists but to no avail. They're all baffled.' Dilip added: 'Doctors from America couldn't even tell us what's wrong. Some doctors have told us his hormones are imbalanced and others said the blood doesn't flow properly and another said it's water retention. But they all fail to tell us what we can do about it.' As Verdant cannot go to school, he has to stay at home with his father Dilip, 30, mother Jayshree, 26, and his one-year-old sister Vrisha . Verdant's father Dilip said he is 'terrified' his son's foot will keep growing like a balloon, and worries about what will happen in future. 'If I had known he would be born with a deformed leg I would have aborted the baby. It is a punishment for any parent to helplessly watch their child suffer' Vedant's big foot keeps growing with age and height so it is likely his foot will continue to grow to shocking proportions. 'I'm terrified his foot will continue to grow and burst like a balloon,' he added. Vedant doesn't feel any pain in his leg or foot and can walk, run, cross his legs and even sit on a bike without any support but many doctors have suggested amputating the leg. 'I've been told amputation is the only option,' his father, Mr Joshi, said. 'But if I cut off his foot my son would be permanently handicapped and dependent on others forever, unable to walk. At least he's mobile right now.' Mr Joshi, who works as an astrologer earning £150 a month by reading horoscopes and organizing purifying rituals at birthdays and weddings, has spent £10,000 in four years meeting doctors. Dr Manibhai Patel, MBBS who runs a private clinic in Deesa, Gujarat, believes his condition is not curable, but equally, is not life-threatening. 'During my 35 year career I have not seen any patient like Vedant. His foot seems to be a genetic disease but I cannot ascertain the real cause so I cannot recommend any medicine or even surgery. But I do not believe it's life threatening.' A British woman called Mandy Sellers, 39, from Lancashire, was born with abnormally large legs, which continued to grow to disproportionate sizes. She was finally diagnosed with the congenital disorder Proteus Syndrome for which there is no known cure. It is thought Vedant could be suffering the same condition. Mrs Joshi was told during her pregnancy that her fetus was a healthy child but Vedant's right leg was abnormally large at birth. Mr Joshi said: 'If I had known he would be born with a deformed leg I would have aborted the baby. It is a punishment for any parent to helplessly watch their child suffer. Verdant finds it difficult to find trousers and shoes that fit. His father has  shoes specially made from the local cobblers, which are sewn out of  old jeans . Mr Joshi said he hopes to find a specialist somewhere in the world who can help his son, to avoid amputation. 'If I cut off his foot my son would be permanently handicapped and dependent on others forever, unable to walk. At least he's mobile right now' 'People get scared of him, some even ask if he has a plastic leg and then he starts crying. It's very sad for him and for us to watch.' Mrs Joshi, who gave birth to her second child, a healthy daughter, in September 2013, added: 'Sometimes Vedant comes to me and cries and says he has a deformed foot because he'd committed a sin in his past life. 'His words tear me apart. I don't have any explanation for him, except keep his faith in God.' Although Vedant doesn't face any obstacles in his daily life, he has trouble finding shoes and trousers to fit. Mr Joshi said: 'It's extremely difficult to find shoes that he can slip his foot into. Earlier we used to buy two pairs of shoes of different sizes and made it fit. 'But two years ago his leg grew so big that no shoe fits. I have to order made to measure shoes from the cobbler which he makes from my old jeans.' Mr Joshi is now hoping to raise awareness to his son's foot, so a specialist may recognize the condition and be able to treat it.","Verdant Joshi was born with a giant foot that now weighs 12lbs (5.4 kg)

"Maryland officials are investigating the death of an inmate who was found dead in his steam-filled prison cell. Louis Stanley Leysath III, 35, was serving a life sentence for a 2008 murder in Jessup Correctional Institution after strangling his then girlfriend to death, when he was found dead on Friday morning, according to prison spokesman Mark Vernarelli. Correctional staff performed CPR on him, but Leysath was pronounced dead a short time later. Louis Stanley Leysath III (above), 35, was serving a life sentence for murder in Jessup Correctional Institution when he was found dead on Friday morning in his cell, which was filled with steam, according to prison spokesman Mark Vernarelli . Leysath was housed alone in the cell where there was no fire nor foul play suspected, and it is unclear whether the death was accidental or a suicide, said Vernarelli. He pleaded guilty in 2010 to first degree murder in Charles County Circuit Court and was sentenced for a May 14, 2008 killing, according to the Baltimore Sun. The incident involved his then girlfriend, Jasmine Nicole Clark, 23, who was found dead covered in a blanket inside of her Waldorf apartment after a domestic dispute with Leysath about the use of her car. Clark's daughters, aged seven and three at the time, who were at the house during the dispute, discovered their mother's body on the floor with a ligature around her neck, according to Southern Maryland News. Leysath stole Clark's car following the incident as he left the apartment, and a 911 call with the seven-year-old girl reported her saying: 'My mom, she won't wake up.' The inmate was later arrested at his parent's home after they reported  their son being disorderly and possibly under the influence of drugs. When police arrived at the parent's home, Leysath was attacking both his mother and father, according to police, and they eventually linked him to Clark's murder. During Leysath's trial, his attorney said that his client had committed the act 'while in a psychotic state' which was brought on by 14 years of PCP abuse. Leysath's death has been reported as occurring 'under unusual circumstance', and the investigation continues (above the Jessup Correctional Institution) In a statement released to Daily Mail Online by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, it said that the department did not provide any information on Leysath's death until officials had located and spoken personally to his family on Saturday. Secretary Stephen Moyer has ordered a thorough administrative review in addition to the death investigation in order to determine whether staff acted appropriately in the hours before the inmate was found. The statement also said due to the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation and the incomplete autopsy results, no further information is available at this time, but that the department will update the case as soon as possible.

"Twitter is constantly making tweaks and trialling new features with select users, but a recent interview with the site suggests major changes are afoot. The vice president of product Kevin Weil and his counterpart in engineering Alex Roetter said that the future of the site hinges on videos, advanced private messaging and customised timelines. This follows reports the social network is looking to replace long Twitter feeds with more relevant and personalised grid-style profiles. Scroll down for video . Twitter's vice president of product Kevin Weil and his counterpart in engineering Alex Roetter said the future of the site hinges on videos, private messaging and customised timelines. Twitter recently launched video editing tools and this focus is set to continue. It could even add full-length films and live streams to timelines . Speaking to TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino, Mr Roetter said: 'We spent a bunch of time doing research and really trying to understand our users. 'One thing we learned is  that when you get Twitter, it provides disproportionate value. 'We’re very focused on making sure that we can get everyone into a place where they can see all the value and all the amazing content that exists only on Twitter.' Mr Weil added: 'Anything you can do on your phone, you should be able to do on Twitter.' Last month Twitter launched its much anticipated video service that lets users edit and upload clips up to 30 seconds long from its app. This service runs alongside its six-second video app Vine. Elsewhere, Twitter recently added group direct messages (DMs) designed to take on the likes of WhatsApp. It lets people have private chats with multiple friends and followers, and this followed the launch of pictures and tweets being embedded into DMs. In terms of customised timelines, Twitter launched its 'While you were away' feature in January. It provides a recap of some of the top tweets a user might have missed from accounts they follow. At the time, product manager Paul Rosania said: 'Our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up – with your world, no matter how much time you spend on Twitter.' Twitter is also said to be trialling a grid-style system with staff and select users. With that in mind, the pair said Twitter is focusing on developing its video content on the site. Last month it launched its much anticipated video service that lets users edit and upload clips up to 30 seconds long from its app. This service runs alongside its six-second video app Vine, and in the future these videos may include full feature-length films that could be purchased with Twitter's 'Buy' button, or even live streams of sporting or trending events, such as the Oscars. Twitter's product director Jinen Kamdar recently told MailOnline the video service was expected to be particularly popular among the service's celebrity users. 'We think this will give people a whole new way to communicate on Twitter. 'We think we've struck a balance that makes it easier for people to share, and it's not so long that people will be turned off'. Mr Kamdar also confirmed the videos will not autoplay, but instead require users to click on then. 'Viewing and playing videos is just as simple: videos are previewed with a thumbnail and you can play them with just one tap.' 'In just a few taps you can add a video to unfolding conversations, share your perspective of a live event, and show your everyday moments instantly, without ever having to leave the app.' He said the move to video came as users wanted to expand their tweets. The last major design change was in April 2014 when Twitter added Best Tweets, giving more precedence to tweets with higher levels of engagement, as well as Pinned Tweets that let people keep posts at the top of their page. Twitter is now said to be trialling a grid-style system with staff and select users . Following the last redesign (left), Twitter was heavily criticised for copying Facebook's layout (right). Twitter has previously said its ambition is to build 'the largest daily audience in the world,' and the changes expected to launch throughout 2015 have been designed to get people to engage with the site more frequently . 'Tweets have been more than 140 characters for some time. 'The Twitter you experience today is rich and immersive, full of images, GIFs, Vines, audio files and videos from some of the world’s most recognizable figures and brands.

'With a few improvements to the home timeline we think we can do a better job of delivering on that promise without compromising the real time nature of Twitter.' This is also likely to continue and develop, according to TechCrunch's report. Mr Weil said that Twitter shouldn't be a 'one size fits all' experience and the way the site organises content and followers should be different for different users.

"An eight-grade student's father was angry after his son received an assignment with a cartoon depicting political views on immigration policy.

The political cartoon, which originally appeared in the Chattanooga Times Free Press (above), depicts the Democrat laying down the bricks while the Republican is removing them . Radies became upset because he thought the questions included in the homework were marked in a way that led his son to be less 'fair and objective', and lean towards a particular political view, according to the Independent Journal Review. Teacher Grace Davis, who did not create the cartoon, included in the worksheet questions about identifying the men in the picture, what they were building, what the symbols on their shirt represented, what action they were doing and what it meant about immigration and citizenship. In some of Jarrett's responses, which were all marked as correct, he wrote the builders' job is 'to build and destroy the pathway to citizenship' and that 'Democrats want immigrants to come in and Republicans don't'. Radies said that when he discussed assignment with social studies teacher Grace Davis, she said she just wanted to expose the students to other views (left, Radies's 13-year-old son Jarrett). A spokesperson for the school district said the cartoon was skill-building for reading and understanding a political cartoon (right, Shattuck Middle School) The angry father posted the homework assignment on Facebook with the caption: 'Knowing my political views, my son thought I would be interested in seeing what his social studies teacher has been ""teaching"" his 8th grade class.

Rather than brainwashing our kids into being future Dem voters, shouldn't they be exposing them to both sides of an issue and teach critical thinking skills?

He replied saying 'some of the other things' his son has heard during her class are consistent with not giving the 'other view' (above a comment on his Facebook about a classroom discussion with the teacher and eighth grade students) It was confirmed that the worksheet was used in Davis's class, but Jim Strick, the Communications Director for the Neenah Joint School District, said that it was not meant to shape the eighth graders' political views (above Radies and his partner) It was confirmed that the worksheet was used in Davis's class, but Jim Strick, the Communications Director for the Neenah Joint School District, said that it was not meant to shape the eighth graders' political views. 1.

But he replied telling her 'some of the other things' his son has heard during her class are consistent with not giving the 'other view'. She responded saying the semester was not over yet. Strick said the cartoon was skill-building for reading and understanding a political cartoon, and that it was the simplest one Davis could find at an eighth-grade level to comprehend the concept of political cartoons.","Scott Radies of Wisconsin said his son Jarrett, 13, had 'unacceptable' assignment and was concerned he was not being taught to be objective .

"After a recent terror threat on an American mall, an official has revealed that the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation has been staging mock attacks in U.S. shopping centers for nearly  two years to test their readiness. The secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson recently warned shoppers at Minnesota's Mall of America to remain vigilant after a new terrorist video from Al-Shabaab -- An Al-Qaeda-linked militant group out of Somalia -- threatened an attack on the iconic mall. But, an official told CNN that the FBI has been preparing for such an attack for nearly two years, since the militant group led a siege at a Kenyan mall, resulting in more than 60 deaths, CNN reports. SWAT: An official has revealed that the United States' FBI has been staging mock attacks in U.S. shopping centers for nearly two years to test the readiness of SWAT teams (stock image) Mall of America: A video released Saturday, reportedly by the Somalia-based militant group Al-Shabaab, threatened a terror attack on Minnesota's Mall of America as well as malls in Canada and the UK . A law enforcement official said that the FBI has teamed up with various malls across the country staging the fake attacks during off hours to test the readiness of SWAT teams. The Department says there is no specific, credible plot from Al-Shabaab, but since the recent release of a video, reportedly by the group, threatening an attack, the Mall of America has heightened its security, USA Today reports. Vigilant: The secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson (photographed) recently warned shoppers at Minnesota's Mall of America to remain vigilant . The official told CNN that in light of the attack on Westgate mall in Nairobi, the FBI has worked to improve security and said that, since then, the FBI has implemented a program working with U.S. malls in order to do so. In the terrorist video released online Saturday, a hooded man, wearing fatigues spoke of the Westgate attack and called for similar attacks on the Mall of America, the country's largest mall, as well as malls in Canada, and the United Kingdom, according to USA Today. 'What if such an attack was to occur in the Mall of America in Minnesota? Or the West Edmonton Mall in Canada? Or in London's Oxford Street?' the man says. Al-Shabaab was named a terrorist organization by the U.S. Bureau of Counterterrorism in 2008 and pledged its allegiance to Al-Qaeda in 2012. The Somalia-based group has limited its attacks to Kenya, Uganda, and its home country, but U.S. officials say the group may be feeling left out as the Islamic State makes headlines, CNN reports. Both the FBI and the Department say they believe the video is a call to action to those who have been radicalized as well as an effort to compete for attention and recruits with other militant groups. Christopher Voss, FBI former agent and terrorism expert, told FOX News that Al-Shabaab's video was a 'guilt trip' to 'try to increase funds.' 'They're low on money,' Voss said. Westgate: The militant group took responsibility for the 2013 attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall where more than 60 people were killed (photographed) 'They needed to do an announcement to make their followers --who are in the area of [Mall of America] and are not doing anything --make them feel guilty for sitting on their hands...they're trying to get them to send them more money.' Johnson told CNN that government officials are taking this threat, just as they would any other, very seriously, no matter what the terrorist group's motives are. 'Any time a terrorist organization calls for an attack on a specific place, we've got to take that seriously.","An official has revealed that the United States' FBI has been staging mock attacks in U.S. shopping centers for nearly two years to test their readiness .

"Two young Thais have been jailed for more than two years for defaming the monarchy in a university play. Student Patiwat Saraiyaem, 23, and activist Porntip Mankong, 26, had pleaded guilty to defamation following their arrests last August, nearly a year after 'The Wolf Bride' - a satire set in a fictional kingdom - was performed. The pair were originally handed five-year jail terms but the sentence was halved due to their confessions, said a judge at Ratchada Criminal Court in Bangkok. Thai student Patiwat Saraiyaem (left), 23, and activist Porntip Mankong (right), 26, are escorted by prison security guards after their verdict at the Criminal Court in Bangkok . 'The court considers their role in the play caused serious damage to the monarchy and sees no reason to suspend their sentences,' he told a packed courtroom including the accused, their relatives and representatives from the UN human rights office and European Union. Rights groups say 'lese majeste' prosecutions have surged since the army seized power from an elected government last May. The  military seeks legitimacy from its self-designated role as protector of the monarchy. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 87, is revered by many in the country as a demi-god and anyone convicted of insulting the king, queen, heir or regent faces up to 15 years in jail on each count. The pair had each been charged with one count of lese majeste linked to the performance at Bangkok's Thammasat University, to mark the 40th anniversary of a pro-democracy student protest on the campus that was brutally crushed by the military regime in October 1973. After they were taken out of  court in handcuffs their lawyer Pawinee Chumsri said her clients would not appeal. Patiwat Saraiyaem (pictured between two security guards), and Porntip Mankong were arrested last August, nearly a year after 'The Wolf Bride' - a satire set in a fictional kingdom - was performed . Police are still hunting for at least six others involved in the play for allegedly violating '112' - the feared section of the Thai criminal code that is one of the world's most draconian royal defamation laws. Of those on the wanted list, at least two have fled Thailand, joining dozens of academics, activists and political opponents of the military regime in self-exile since the coup. The Paris-based International Federation of Human Rights said at least 40 people have been arrested since the takeover - with nine of them sentenced to between two and 15 years in prison. Critics say the lese majeste law has been used as a tool to suppress political dissent, noting that many of those charged have been linked to the opposition Red Shirt movement. Rights activists as well as local and international media are forced to censor discussion of cases since even repeating details of charges risks breaking the law. Under junta rule Thailand has seen a rapid deterioration in civil rights with the military crushing any criticism of the coup - from banning protests and censoring the media to arresting and detaining opponents. Local students and activists show their support after a court announced the verdict on the two young Thais who were accused of insulting the monarchy in a university play . 'The Wolf Bride' was performed in October 2013, several months before the coup, but the case is just one of many driven through by the junta. 'The junta is using the law to bolster its legitimacy with the Thai people,' said Paul Chambers, director of research at the Institute of South East Asian Affairs in Chiang Mai. Previous administrations including that of ousted premier Yingluck Shinawatra have also used the legislation in this way, but the junta has been 'even stronger' in asserting its 'obedience to the monarchy' through the crackdown, he added. Andrea Giorgetta from the International Federation of Human Rights also said the junta was drawing legitimacy through the monarchy and that the surge in lese majeste cases looked set to continue. 'We're expecting a lot more people to go to jail in the next month. Almost all cases have been backdated (for alleged offences) before the coup,' he told AFP. 'It's a very grim situation for rights in Thailand.' Analysts say the most recent chapter of Thailand's long-drawn political turmoil is fuelled by anxieties over who will run the country when the more than six-decade reign of the world's longest-serving monarch eventually ends.","Patiwat Saraiyaem and Porntip Mankong were both arrested in August 2014 .

"In the desperate search for bodies after Hurricane Katrina,  rescue teams waded through New Orleans armed with spray cans. Each crumbling home they searched was marked with an X. A number sprayed next to it indicated how many dead bodies lay inside. Now, a decade on from one of the most devastating natural disasters in U.S. history that killed more than 1,800 people, the haunting red, yellow and green graffiti lingers in a once-thriving city that has been reduced to squalor.

Homeless people and drug addicts line the streets, and homes are covered with moss. Despite years of work to rectify the damage - around $1 trillion of it - many of the properties look freshly obliterated. In a series of images by photographer Johnny Joo, the urban area shows no sign of recovery. Ohio native Joo, 24, went to the east side of New Orleans, which has been largely neglected as other parts of the city were rejuvenated.. He said: 'Even before the hurricane hit, a lot of the affected areas had a great deal of poverty, but I was still amazed that so many houses in areas lay in shambles, while people still continue to scrap to live, or support their habits. 'There were an incredible amount of homeless, drug addicts, scrappers all along the area, especially on the East side.

He said: 'I was actually surprised by how much effort has went into the cleanup effort, along with how much they have actually accomplished after such an unprecedented disaster.' The Cleveland-born photojournalist also visited the decaying Six Flags amusement park which was heavily damaged in the floods. Joo said much like the rest of the East Side, the park had been struggling economically before Katrina hit. 'Six Flags was closed prior to Katrina due to low attendance and financial issues and even when it was open it was somewhat of a ghost town. 'After the hurricane, it was just deemed far too damaged to salvage, so it has been left abandoned and continued to rot.' The snapper also insisted that more awareness was needed to highlight the continued problems which New Orleans faces, 10 years on. He said: 'So many people lost their lives, family members, homes and are still living on the streets at no fault of their own - I wish more people could see this forgotten part of America.'","Photographer Johnny Joo visited east side of New Orleans which was largely neglected by the clean-up .

"The Homeland Security Department is backing away from an idle warning issued Sunday by Secretary Jeh Johnson, who had said a Somali terror group's threat against the Mall of America would complicate the possibility that his agency could be partially shut down by the weekend. Congress is still battling over a DHS budget that it put on a short leash in December, with Republicans threatening to put the agency in default rather than allowing President Barack Obama to move forward with a plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants. 'If anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they have got to be particularly careful,' Johnson told a CNN audience on Sunday. He steered most of the interview toward dire warnings about what would happen if his budget remains in limbo past its Feb. 27 expiration date. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . STERN WARNING: On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Mall of America shoppers should be on guard because a Somali terror group had issued a threat of violence . 42 MILLION PEOPLE: 'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Johnson said, talking about the US's most popular indoor shopping center . BONE-CHILLING: A video released by the Al-Shabaab terror group on Saturday calledf for attacks on shopping centers including the Mall of America, a Canadian mall, and London's Oxford Street shopping corridor . But on Monday DHS walked Johnson's words back, with spokeswoman Marsha Catron saying that despite a videotaped threat from the Al-Shabaab terror group, 'we are not aware of any specific, credible plot against the Mall of America or any other domestic commercial shopping center.' Al-Shabaab, the most active jihadi group in Somalia, released a video Saturday online that recalled its involvement in a 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, and urged Muslims to attack three shopping meccas. The terror network's named targets include the Mall of America, West Edmonton Mall in Canada and London's Oxford Street corridor. DON'T DEFUND ME: Secretary Johnson is already blaming Republicans in Congress for an expected partial agency shutdown that may hit DHS after its funding runs out on Friday night . The Kenya mass-shooting killed 67 and injured at least 175. Saturday's video showed the Mall of America and the shopping center's GPS coordinates. It called for 'Westgate-style' attacks against 'American or Jewish shopping centers.' The Mall of America welcomes about 42 million shoppers every year – more than eight times Minnesota's entire population – and employs 12,000 people, pumping more than $2 billion into the state's economy. Overall it occupies 4.8 million square feet, a large enough space to fit seven Yankee stadiums. Minnesota is the epicenter of Somali immigration into the United States, hosting more than 25,000 refugees from the northeastern African nation. That's more than 28 per cent of the more than 85,700 such Somalis who live in the United States. SCENES FROM THE TWIN CITIES: Of the 85,700 Somali refugees living in the United States, 25,000 live in Minnesota – and some might be sympathetic to their countrymen in Al-Shabaab . PLAYGROUND: Mall of America puts more than $2 billion into the Minnesota economy every year . Its head office in Bloomington, Minnesota said in a statement that it would 'continue to monitor events with the help of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. As always, we take any potential threat seriously and respond appropriately.' 'Mall of America has implemented extra security precautions, some may be noticeable to guests, and others won't be. We will continue to follow the situation, along with law enforcement, and will remain vigilant as we always do in similar situations.' Jim Kallstrom, a former FBI assistant director in New York City, told a Fox News Channel audience on Sunday that the FBI has a 'huge job in front of them.' 'You look at the Mall of America, you look at all the malls then you start to backtrack and say you know it would be nice if we knew what comes and goes into the country,' he said. 'We don't have a clue.' KENYAN POLICE, 2013: Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the Westgate Mall shooting that killed more than 60 people . Johnson remarked on CNN that it's significant to see Al-Shabaab and the ISIS terror army urging Muslims to launch attacks in the West on their behalf. 'We're beyond the phase now where these groups would sendforeign operatives into countries after being trained someplace,' the DHS chief said. On Monday he appeared for a brief press conference in which he pilloried congressional Republicans for threatening to hold up his agency's budget. A 'shutdown' wouldn't affect more than 80 per cent of DHS's workforce, since they are considered 'essential' national security personnel – although they would have to wait to get paid until after the stalemate ends.","Jeh Johnson warned on Sunday that 'if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they have got to be particularly careful'

Mrs Clinton said she would not recommend her daughter getting into politics. Last month it was claimed Chelsea was on the verge of launching her own political career with a run for Congress. Her mother recalled former president Franklin D. Roosevelt's wife Eleanor's advice to would-be politicians. ‘If you get into politics, you have to grow a skin as thick as the rhinoceros because it can be very painful if you're not prepared - you're going to be subjected to all these criticisms,’ Mrs Clinton said.

"Two drunken friends played a game of 'paper, scissors, stone' to decide who would snatch a 55-year-old woman's handbag. David Tawse and Sam Breakwell struck when the terrified woman was just yards from her home in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. The traumatised victim has kept a diary since the attack, revealing how she is now scared to leave her home and panics when she sees anyone in a hooded top. Thugs: Drunken friends David Tawse (left) and Sam Breakwell (right) played 'paper, scissors, stone' to decide who would snatch a 55-year-old woman's handbag . In one entry, on the day of the mugging attempt, she wrote: 'Emotional, tearful, angry, outraged and overwhelmed.' The court heard how the woman was walking home  when the thugs, who had been drinking, spotted her. They had already decided to rob someone because their plan to sell DVDs to raise money had not made them as much as they wanted. The woman held on tightly to the handbag when she heard the footsteps behind her quicken and feared she was going to be robbed. After feeling a tug, she turned and saw Tawse in his hoody. She screamed to alert neighbours, causing him to scarper. Tawse, 22, and Breakwell, 19, ran off to a nearby pub, but were arrested half an hour later in a park after witnesses gave police descriptions of them. In her impact statement, the victim said: 'I still feel the same anxiety when walking alone anywhere, which is unavoidable when walking to work. 'Before this incident, I had no anxiety about walking around the town at any time. Now, I worry, especially when walking in the dark.' The pair struck when the terrified woman was just yards from her home in Northallerton (pictured), North Yorkshire . Tom Mitchell, defending Tawse, said: 'This sort of offence causes misery to people. It was dreadful.' 'In so far as they can make amends, these young men have done all they can. Having done the harm he did, he can do no more to put it right, after his frank admissions to the police and his early guilty plea.' Andrew White, for Breakwell,  added: 'The victim will have known from an early stage that she would not need to come to court to relive this incident.' Both defence lawyers said the attackers had shown genuine remorse, and Breakwell - who has never before been in trouble - wanted to write to the woman to apologise. Mr White said: 'At the time of the offence, his personal circumstances were pretty desperate. He had nowhere to live, he was sleeping rough on occasions. 'He had lost his job, had no money for food, no benefits, and he was extremely hungry. He had not eaten for several days.' Mr Mitchell added: 'Mr Tawse had not eaten for two days. This was an attempt to get something to try to eat. That's no excuse. You cannot resort to robbery just because you are hungry.' Both men admitted attempted robbery and were jailed for 12 months at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) The pair both pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted robbery at an earlier court hearing and were jailed for 12 months. The judge, Recorder Michael Slater, told them: 'She would be outraged if, after what she had been through, I simply allowed you your liberty. 'You hatched a plan, because of your financial situation, to target someone exactly like her to snatch their bag and take money from it. 'So it was when she came into your view that you targeted her and followed her for about 500 yards as she was on her way home. 'At some stage, she became aware of that, and frightened, she got out her house keys, but not before you Tawse, after a game of paper, scissors, had elected to be the one who snatched the bag. 'If I was simply concerned with the situation of each of you, given your previous good characters and given you are still young men and you have seen the error of your ways, I would try to do something that involved not sending you to immediate custody, but I cannot do that because I have the concerns regarding the complainant to address first and foremost.'","David Tawse and Sam Breakwell tried to rob woman, 55, outside her home .

"Syrian rebels turned a captured tank on government forces today and bombarded a military airbase boosting their firepower in the week-long battle for the country's commercial capital Aleppo. President Bashar al-Assad's troops meanwhile pounded the strategic Salaheddine district in Aleppo itself with tank and artillery fire while rebels tried to consolidate their hold on areas they have seized. In the capital Damascus, troops overran a suburb yesterday killing at least 35 people, mostly unarmed civilians, residents and activist organisations said. Captured weapons: Syrian rebels captured a tank and used it against government forces, boosting their firepower in a week-long battle for commercial capital Aleppo . The fighting for Syria's two biggest cities highlights the country's rapid slide into full scale civil war 17 months on from the peaceful street protests that marked the start of the anti-Assad uprising. It comes as Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced today that he would step down as the U.N. Arab League mediator in the 17 month conflict at the end of the month. U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said in a statement: 'Mr Annan has informed me, and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, Mr Nabil Elaraby, of his intention not to renew his mandate when it expires on 31 August 2012. Unarmed: Meanwhile in the capital Damascus, troops overran a suburb killing at least 35 people, mostly unarmed civilians raising accusations of new atrocities . Full scale civil war: As Damascus is devastated by shelling, the fighting here and in Aleppo highlights the country's rapid descent into civil war 17 months after peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad marked the beginning of the uprising . 'Kofi Annan deserves our profound . admiration for the selfless way in which he has put his formidable . skills and prestige to this most difficult and potentially thankless of . assignments.' World powers have watched with . mounting concern as diplomatic efforts to find a negotiated solution . have faltered and violence that has already claimed an estimated 18,000 . lives worsens. The rebels' morale was boosted when they turned a government tank's gun on the Menakh airbase 25 miles north of Aleppo, a possible staging post for reinforcements for the army's attack on Aleppo. A rebel fight said: ‘We hit the airport using a tank that we captured from the Assad army. ‘We attacked the airport a few times but we have decided to retreat at this time.’ The . pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government . forces at the airbase had used artillery and rocket launchers to bombard . the town of Tel Rifaat, which lies between the airbase and Aleppo. Under fire: Rebels tried to consolidate their hold on downtown Aleppo as government troops targeted the area with tank and artillery fire . Boosted morale: Rebel fighters load an anti-aircraft machine gun in Atareb, a town 15 miles east of Aleppo as their morale is boosted after using the captured government tank against the army . Heavy weapons fire was heard this morning from Salaheddine in southwest Aleppo, a gateway to the city of 2.5 million people that has been fought over for the past week. Heavily armed government troops are trying to drive a force of a few thousand rebel fighters from the city in battles whose outcome could be a turning point in the conflict. Although government forces have made concerted efforts to take Salaheddine, a full out assault on the city as a whole has yet to take place. Mobile phone connections have been cut since Wednesday evening, leading to speculation among residents that an increase in military action might be imminent. Prepared to fight: Rebel forces have been consolidating areas they control in Aleppo, attacking police posts and minor military installations. They claim to have seized three police stations this week . Big city barrage: The latest fighting in Syria's two biggest cities, Aleppo and Damascus, is causing mounting concern among world powers . Facing tanks and artillery in Salaheddine, a shattered neighbourhood that straddles a highway into the south, rebels said they planned an offensive elsewhere in the region but did not disclose their objective. The rebels are consolidating areas they control in Aleppo, attacking police posts and minor military installations with some success. They claim to have seized three police stations this week. In Damascus, still a government stronghold but a scene of combat in the past two weeks, government troops faced new accusations of atrocities after their attack yesterday. A resident, who gave his name as Fares, said by phone from from Jdeidet Artouz, southwest of Damascus: ‘When the streets were clear we found the bodies of at least 35 men. ‘Almost all of them were executed with bullets to their face, head and neck in homes, gardens and basements.’ Disappeared: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has not spoken in public since a bomb attack on his inner circle two weeks ago causing concern for his safety . Syrian state television said ‘dozens of . terrorists and mercenaries surrendered or were killed’ when the army . raided Jdeidet Artouz and its surrounding farmlands. In a rallying cry to his troops on Wednesday, Assad said their battle against rebels would decide Syria's fate. In a shift toward increased foreign involvement in the war, U.S. President Barack Obama signed a secret order authorizing American support for the rebels, according to U.S. sources familiar with the matter. The order, approved earlier this year, broadly permits the CIA and other U.S. agencies to provide support that could help the rebels oust Assad. The lightly armed insurgents are battling a well-equipped army that has overwhelming superiority on paper. But the rebels have managed to capture some tanks and heavy weapons and their ranks are swelled by army defectors. The rebels, however, are united mostly by loathing of Assad, and have failed to come together despite pressure from the West, Turkey and Sunni-ruled Arab states who back their cause. But his call-to-arms, in a written statement, gave no clues to his whereabouts two weeks after a bomb attack on his inner circle. Assad, who succeeded his late father Hafez 11 years ago to perpetuate the family's rule of Syria, has not spoken in public since the bombing in Damascus killed four of his close security aides, although he has appeared in recorded clips on television. His low public profile suggests acute concern about his safety since the attack in which his brother-in-law died. Amid growing signs that the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo is getting worse, the World Food Programme said it was sending emergency food supplies for up 28,000 people. The fighting in Salaheddine district, part of a rebel-held arc stretching to the northeast of Aleppo, has left neither side in full control. On Al-Sharqeya Street, residents and shop owners looked in awe at the damage. Some searched through what was left of their buildings - huge piles of concrete and twisted metal. As he abandoned his home, Abu Ahmed said: ‘I saw death before my eyes. ‘I was hiding in the alleyway of my building when I heard the whiz of the artillery. Look at my street now.’ They said the damage was caused by . helicopter fire targeting a rebel brigade based in a school. It missed . the school and hit the residential buildings instead. Destruction: It is not just the devastation of buildings and homes that is killing thousands, but food is running short with the World Food Programme sending emergency food supplies for up to 28,000 people . Hunger games: Syrians carry bags of bread away from a bakery in the northern town of Aldana near Aleppo . Mr Ahmed, holding just a plastic bag with his meagre belongings, said: ‘This dog Assad and his men are so blind they can't even target a brigade properly. State television said yesterday that the army was pursuing remaining ‘terrorists’ in one Aleppo district and had killed several, including foreign Arab fighters. Some foreign fighters, including militant Islamists, have joined the battle against Assad, who accuses outside powers of financing and arming the insurgents. Aleppo, a commercial hub with a historic Old City, had long stayed aloof from the uprising, but many of its 2.5 million residents are now caught up in battle zones, facing shortages of food, fuel, water and cooking gas. Thousands have fled and hospitals and makeshift clinics can barely cope with casualties after more than a week of combat. World Food Programme said: ‘The humanitarian situation is deteriorating in Aleppo and food needs are growing rapidly.’ VIDEO: Protests at the Yarmouk Refugee Camp in Damascus after at least 20 are killed from shelling...","Rebels consolidate their forces in Aleppo after a week-long battle for Syria's commercial capital .

"A couple have told of their grief after their weeks-old grandchild, born with Downs Syndrome, was given up for adoption and separated from her twin sister (file image: not a picture of those involved) A couple have told of their grief after their weeks-old grandchild, born with Downs Syndrome, was given up for adoption and separated from her twin sister. The grandparents, who have chosen not to be identified, have described how the tiny baby was handed over to social services while the parents decided to keep the healthy twin. Now seven, the girls live completely different lifestyles with one living overseas and attending an international private school and the other receiving state primary education and living with her new family in a terraced house in England. The case has similarities to that of Gammy, a Down’s syndrome baby born to a Thai surrogate. The child was at the centre of an international outcry after his Australian parents were accused of leaving him in Thailand with his surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, and taking home the healthy twin. The couple, David and Wendy Farnell later denied this was the case insisting that the Thai mother would not hand over Gammy and have said they want to get the seven-month-old baby back. Pattharamon Chanbua later told Associated Press that she feared the baby would be put 'in an institute'. In the recent case in Britain, the grandparents involved insisted the matter should have gone before High Court judges, accusing the council involved of 'mishandling' the situation, the Sunday Times reports. They told the newspaper that the baby girl's parents were top executives at international companies and were working overseas when they flew back to Britain and handed the child to social services. According to the report, they have been fighting to maintain contact with the adopted child and had 'begged' the council involved to get advice when the babies were separated. The grandparents revealed how their son and daughter-in-law did not have an amniocentesis test - capable of diagnosing Down's syndrome - when they found out they were going to have twins in 2006 fearing they would lose the pregnancy. The youngster was 'terribly ill' following the birth and the parents feared she would not live. The grandparents were then informed that the mother and father had opted not to keep the child. The grandfather told the Sunday Times: 'It is difficult to say how they felt because they have never discussed it with us. 'Relatives and friends thought they had made an outrageous decision... They said ""How could they do that?"", but it was none of their business.' They went on to describe the heartbreaking moment they said goodbye to the baby having bonded with her for a matter of days. The elderly couple later decided they wanted to maintain contact with the child - against the wishes of their son and daughter-in-law. The grandparents' case has similarities to that of Gammy (left), a Down’s syndrome baby born to Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua (right) At first, authorities told them they would not be able to visit their granddaughter but it was eventually agreed they would be able to see her once a year, the newspaper reports. After further rows with the authority, an independent investigation took place and their complaints about the council were partly upheld. The grandmother said the ordeal had 'destroyed' her but that the child was happy and performing well at school. She added that those involved did not receive the help they needed. The Sunday Times reports that the council involved declined to comment on the matter. Around one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK will have Down's syndrome, according to the Down's Syndrome Association. The organisation says that there are 40,000 people in Britain with the condition, which is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome in a baby's cells. Those with the syndrome have a life expectancy of between 50 and 60 years, though many live on into their 60s, the Association says on its website.","Couple tell of grief after grandchild born with Down's syndrome is separated from her twin .

"Scathing: A report says Cliff Richard had his privacy violated during the police raid on his home . Sir Cliff Richard had his privacy violated after a secret deal between police and the BBC to film a raid on his house, a report says. The horrified pop star was left ‘unnecessarily distressed’ after learning police had swooped on his £3.5million home in Berkshire over a sex assault allegation dating from 1985 only when he saw it on TV while in Portugal. Images were beamed live around the world last August from a camera filming from a helicopter. Now a previously unpublished report says the deal between the BBC and the police should never have been done – suggesting Sir Cliff should not have been publicly humiliated in this way. It brands senior officials at South Yorkshire Police incompetent and calls the BBC dishonest for its explanation of how it came to know about the raid. After a BBC reporter approached the force, police chiefs allowed a reporting team including a camera crew to show officers searching the star’s home. The coverage caused a major row, and the findings by independent investigator and former chief constable Andy Trotter will reignite the controversy. Sir Cliff has not been arrested or charged. But many viewers said the BBC coverage made the 74-year-old singer look guilty. The damning report – released to the Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act – concludes: . Mr Trotter says: ‘People have seen a search of Sir Cliff Richard’s apartment unfold on television with details of a serious allegation put into the public domain prior to him being interviewed by the police. Scroll down for video . Coverage: BBC reporter David Sillito outside Sir Cliff's home. His colleague Dan Johnson (not pictured) was invited in for a meeting with senior figures at South Yorkshire Police . Consequence: The deal struck between the force and the BBC led to detailed coverage of the raid on the complex where Sir Cliff had a flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire (pictured), including a news helicopter . The search and the nature of the allegation... certainly interfered with his privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress.’ He concludes that had the force refused to co-operate, the BBC would probably never have run the story. Although the BBC reporter, Dan Johnson, was not interviewed, Mr Trotter decided the corporation had not been fully open about how it came to hear about the allegation against Sir Cliff. The BBC claim – that Mr Johnson had persuaded South Yorkshire Police to agree the deal when all he knew was the name of the celebrity suspect – was ‘not one I believe to be credible’, Mr Trotter said. Evidence supported the police account that Mr Johnson had detailed knowledge and ‘knew as much’ as police did when he made contact. The BBC has never revealed the source of the original information. Up close: The footage of the raid showed several investigators entering and had images inside the house . News event: But Sir Cliff, who maintains his innocence, has not been arrested or charged over the claim . Sir Cliff has called the allegation that he sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in 1985 ‘completely false’. He was interviewed by police under caution and, more than six months on, inquiries are on-going. Mr Trotter was asked to investigate police handling of the raid by police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. Analysis reveals the BBC journalist contacted the force’s communications director Carrie Goodwin on July 14 after an alleged leak from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into abuse claims involving Jimmy Savile. A meeting was held the next day with Mr Johnson and Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who agreed to tell him the date and location of the raid in exchange for him holding the story until that day to protect the investigation. The chief constable was also informed of the agreement. Mr Trotter said Miss Goodwin should not have arranged the meeting with Mr Fenwick, not have confirmed any information about the inquiry to the BBC reporter and not have agreed to notify him of the search. Mr Fenwick should have refused to meet or disclose any details to the BBC. And Chief Constable David Crompton ‘could have rescinded the agreement’. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard.’ The BBC was not directly involved in Mr Trotter’s review. A spokesman said: ‘The home affairs committee has already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story. We have nothing further to add.’ A spokesman for Sir Cliff said he would not comment.","Sir Cliff first saw raid on his £3.5m Berkshire home on TV last August .

"A stranded cargo ship was busted out of ten-foot thick ice by a hulking Canadian icebreaker after a US Coast Guard ship got stuck. The Arthur M Anderson had languished in frozen-over Lake Erie for five days on its way to Wisconsin after getting trapped by the hefty sheets of ice. Its ten-strong crew were stuck on board - and hoped to be rescued by the US Coast Guard's Bristol Bay tugboat. Breaking free: The Arthur M Anderson, front, was stuck in Lake Erie, and needed to be rescued by a Canadian coast guard ship, back, after a failed attempt by the U.S. Battling the cold: The Anderson, left, was stuck in the icy waters for five days before the rescue by the Griffon, sent by the Canadian coast guard . Stranded: The Arthur M Anderson, a 767ft cargo ship, was trapped in the ice on Lake Erie for five days . Savior: The Canadian coast guard's Griffon smashed through the thick ice and freed both ships . But that ship ended up getting stuck in the ice itself - at which point the Canadian coast guard was called in for help. They dispatched the much large Griffon icebreaker, which has now rescued both ships from the ice. The 234ft icebreaker first rescued the Bristol Bay, which would have run out of food had a Coast Guard helicopter not made an emergency delivery. Worth a try: The U.S. coast guard dispatched the Bristol Bay to rescue the Anderson - but it got stuck too . The real deal: Canada's coast guard then sent out the Griffon, a much larger icebreaker, which rescued both ships . After helping the beleaguered rescue boat, which sailed home to Cleveland, the Griffon turned back for the Anderson, Cleveland.com reported. It managed to smash a space around the ship then carve out a path for the Anderson to make it to Detroit. Coast guard ships reported that the ice on the lake was often six feet thick, with some parts up to ten feet thick. Because of strong winds over the lake, ice flows are broken apart then freeze back together on top of each other in 'wind rows', which are even thicker than regular ice.","Arthur M Anderson cargo ship was tripped in frozen-over Lake Erie .

"The Church of England is advertising for low-paid jobs, including three at Canterbury Cathedral, the seat of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby . The Church of England has been accused of hypocrisy for demanding a minimum 'Living Wage' of £7.85, despite offering potential staff as little as £6.50 per hour. In an unprecedented intervention into the general election campaign last week, Church leaders hit out at the 'burgeoning' poverty of people in work and said it 'backed the concept of a Living Wage.' The letter, which sparked a political row, also rallied against the market economy, consumerism, and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher. But it has now emerged that a string of churches are advertising for jobs at the lowest possible legal minimum wage, which is currently £6.50. Among those advertising for the low-paid jobs is Canterbury Cathedral, the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, which is recruiting two kiosk assistant vacancies for £6.70. The third low-paid job which has been advertised at Canterbury Cathedral is for a kitchen porter, who would be paid £7.75 per hour. Other cathedrals offering less than the Living Wage are Lichfield Cathedral and Pickering Church. A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: 'They should practise what they preach. It is hypocritical of them to admonish others when they don't seem to be able to put their own house in order.' Tory MP Charlie Elphicke added: 'It's astonishing that the Church of England can call for the Living Wage to be paid by employers but don't pay it themselves.' Elsewhere in the UK, a listing on the Lichfield diocese website says it is looking for a 'cook/chef' who would work on a pro-rata salary of £11,830-£13,650. If the person works the full 25 hours a week, they would be paid between £6.50 and £7.50 per hour. The cathedral is also advertising for waiting staff under a listing entitled 'Casual Waiting-On Staff (National Minimum Wage)'. The advert asks for candidates with previous waiting experience, who are willing to cover weekday, weekend and Bank Holiday shifts. Meanwhile, an advert posted by the Diocese of York is offering £7.65 to a pastoral worker at Pickering Church - 20p less than the Living Wage. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said today: 'It's embarrassing, of course, I won't say otherwise. 'But in the light of transparency, which I welcome, I will say we are a complex institution and every parish church and cathedral is an independent charity, as is every diocese. 'We don't have a centralised method of control. I'm not very keen on centralised control where, from far away, you tell people what to do.' Among the adverts is one for kiosk assistants at Canterbury Cathedral, who would be paid £6.70 per hour . He said change to a living wage would come 'gradually', because each of the independent charities lacked the resources to move more quickly. He added: 'As charities they have to do that gradually. You'll see that - and you'll see the accusations of hypocrisy, but make up your own mind as to what it is.' A spokesman for the Church of England said it had been 'at the forefront' of campaigning for the Living Wage. But she admitted that every parish, diocese and cathedral reaches its own decision on pay, because each is a separate legal entity. The spokesman added: 'The vast majority of those employed by or sub-contracted to the central institutions are already paid at least the Living Wage and all will be by April 2017.' Canterbury Cathedral said that it is committed to introducing the Living Wage when 'economically feasible' and said 'well over half' of the staff were paid at least the Living Wage. The letter from the House of Bishops,  published last week, was criticised as being a 'shopping list' of left-wing demands, which led to ministers mocking the 'dwindling relevance' of the Church's bishops. They called for 'new direction' in politics to replace a society that they said is self-interested, fragmented and badly led by politicians. Referring to 'in-work poverty', the letter read: 'We have seen the burgeoning of in-work poverty - people cannot earn enough to live decently. A job advert listed on the Diocese of Lichfield website asks for experienced waiting stuff to work for national minimum wage . Another listing on the site asks for an experienced cook/chef who would be earning between £6.50 and £7.50 per hour . 'This is why the Church of England has backed the concept of the Living Wage - an agreement with employers to ensure that all their staff earn a modest hourly rate that is sufficient for a full time worker to live decently.' The Church insisted that the letter was meant to counter the message – promoted by comedian Russell Brand – that taking part in politics is useless. The bishops claimed their intention was not to tell people how to vote. But the 'letter to the people and parishes of the Church of England' suggested inequality and social injustice had increased under the Coalition. They said the burden of austerity has fallen on the poor and that worklessness is 'corrosive of human dignity and sense of identity'. The document, published in the name of the CofE's 51-member House of Bishops, called for continued membership of the EU, a re-think of the nuclear deterrent, and the end of the first-past-the-post voting system. The bishops also declared that there has been 'an ugly undercurrent of racism in every debate about immigration' and said that to cut the international aid budget would be 'globally irresponsible'. An advert posted by the Diocese of York is offering £7.65 an hour to a pastoral worker at Pickering Church . The letter, entitled Who Is My Neighbour?, called for a new vision in politics to move the country on from the welfare state introduced by Labour after 1945 or Lady Thatcher's drive to break the grip of the unions after 1979. It criticised the welfare state because voluntary efforts were 'marginalised' and because 'dependence on state provision can undermine individual initiative and responsibility'. However, it directed its main fire at the market economy. Meanwhile, a new study has found that half of workers in some parts of the country are earning less than the living wage. Research for the TUC discovered that one in five jobs in Britain pays less than the £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 elsewhere - well above the national minimum wage of £6.50. A source close to Iain Duncan Smith said: 'They should practise what they preach' In some areas, including parts of Birmingham, just over half of workers receive less than the living wage, rising to almost two thirds of women, said the report. In contrast, fewer than one in 10 workers in parts of London, Surrey, Cambridgeshire and Edinburgh earn less than the living wage. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Extending the living wage is a vital step towards tackling the growing problem of in-work poverty across Britain. 'Working families have experienced the biggest squeeze on their living standards since Victorian times, and these living wage figures show that women are disproportionately affected. 'Pay has been squeezed at all levels below the boardroom, and the Government's mantra about 'making work pay' is completely out of touch with reality.' Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The growth of low pay under David Cameron shows the Tory plan has failed millions of working families.

"A Project Runway: All Stars contestant recreated the Givenchy Haute Couture gown worn by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike at last night's Academy Awards ceremony - in just five hours. Sonjia Williams, 27, from Boston, worked through the night in order to finish the design, which was modeled by Today show host Natalie Morales during this morning's broadcast. 'I picked up a couple of fabrics [before the ceremony aired],' the designer explained to Today anchor Savannah Guthrie. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Today show host Natalie Morales (L) modeled a copy of the Givenchy Haute Couture gown worn by Rosamund Pike (R) at last night's Oscars . It's in the detail: While designer Sonjia Williams did not have access to the same kind of lace fabric used on the original Givenchy design, she copied every other aspect of the gown, including the scalloped neckline . The real deal: Rosamund's dress was viewed by many as one of the highlights of last night's red carpet . Hard at work: Sonjia, pictured in the Today show studio, admitted that she had worked through the night in order to finish her design . 'I thought I was bound to see something red on the red carpet, obviously. I didn't have any lace but I had this red leather leftover and I thought that it would give that same look that you can see with the detailing on the side and on the belt. 'So I used that and then did the scalloping detail on the neckline, and we have a close enough dress of what it would have been for me to have done it in five or six hours.' While the dress was not an exact replica of the beautifully-detailed lace-embellished gown worn by Rosamund last night, both Savannah and Natalie agreed that Sonjia had done the best job possible with the materials that she had available. 'We should say that Rosamund Pike's dress is a Givenchy dress, I mean it's fabulous and beautiful,' Savannah said, before asking Sonjia: 'You did this in how many hours? 'Five hours, I haven't slept!' the reality star admitted. She added: 'I didn't have the fabric, I didn't really know how I was going to make a dress that had the same look the way that the lace detailing is. You know [this material] is red crepe, it's not anything close to that fabric. The big reveal: Both Natalie (pictured) and Savannah Guthrie were thrilled with the final result . Leading lady: Rosamund was nominated for the Best Actress award for her role in Gone Girl at last night's ceremony, but lost out to Still Alice star Julianne Moore . Sewing star: Sonjia took to her Instagram account on Monday morning to thank the Today show for inviting her to take part in the challenge . 'But I think me having that red leather that really kind of made that pop with the color so you can see at least the detailing and it stands out.' Despite the frantic rush to get the design finished and fitted in time for Natalie to wear it on the show, Sonjia confessed that she had a great time taking part in the challenge - and took to Instagram shortly after appearing on the show to thank the Today team for having her. 'Thanks @todayshow for having me this morning!' she commented alongside an image of herself sitting in the studio with her sewing machine. 'I haven't slept since 7am yesterday but it was totally worth it.' While Rosamund, who was nominated for Best Actress for her role in thriller Gone Girl, did not take home a coveted statue at the end of the ceremony last night, the starlet and her beautifully-ornate gown were hailed by many as being among the top red carpet winners of the evening. 'Rosamund Pike absolutely slaying in @givenchy. How did she JUST have a kid?' one Twitter user commented, while another added: 'Rosamund Pike's dress?! WOW. Just wow.'","Sonjia Williams, 27, created her own version of the Gone Girl star's Givenchy dress last night .

"Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is set to become the second Western leader to visit Iran in a decade, when she visits Tehran in April. Ms Bishop received the invitation from Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and the trip is being seen as a potential game-changer in the fight against terrorism in the Middle East. Australia's foreign minister apparently got the go-ahead from the White House for the rare visit, with hopes she could play a key role as a broker between Washington and Iran. Scroll down for video . Australia's foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is set to become the second Western leader to visit Iran in ten years . There are also hopes that Australia could strike up a trading relationship with Iran, which exports, wheat and meat. Ms Bishop, who became the first female deputy leader of the Liberal Party and the first woman to be foreign minister, is now one of the most famous faces in Australian politics. She is renowned for her immaculate and polished appearance as she makes deals and shakes hands with some of the world's most powerful leaders. The Us-aligned government member will sit down with Tehran's minister just two months before the US and Iran's deadline for their energy initiative.

Australia's foreign minister apparently got the go-ahead from the White House for the rare visit, with hopes she could play a key role as a broker between Washington and Iran . Tehran's Shiite government has been in talks with the US regarding their use of energy, to prevent a possible outbreak of war between Iran and Israel. According to Fairfax media, Julie Bishop will do somewhat of a tour around the Middle East, also meeting with leaders in the Saudi Arabia city of Riyadh and also Baghdad. It has been over a decade since the last Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer visited Tehran in 2003. Julie Bishop will also visit Baghdad and Riyadh in her trip of the Middle East . Iran has been closed off to other world leaders in the past few years. The last Western leader to visit the country was UN High Representative Catherin Ashton, who visited the country in 2012. Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful. Along with that, she has had to stave off rumours of her taking over the top job from Tony Abbott. Her popularity has jumped over the past 12 months, mainly due to her strong performance on the international stage in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security. Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine.

But despite Liberal leadership speculation over the past month, Ms Bishop still maintains she is happy in her current role as Foreign Minister.

"The Gandhi scion will be away for 'three or four weeks' on a 'finding-himself journey' The day Parliament kicked off its Budget Session, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi surprised even his own party members by proceeding on a “leave of absence for a few weeks”. The development immediately spawned barbs from various quarters, including social media, and left the Congress battling extreme embarrassment. Seeking to clear the air in the aftermath of growing speculation about Rahul’s move, a senior Congress leader close to the Gandhi family told Mail Today that the heir will take over as the party president as early as in April or June. “Since he wants to reinvent the party, he will bring in his own team. Rahul wants to restructure the party and take it out of the clutches of the old guard. But the process isn’t easy since the old retainers are understandably unwilling to relinquish their control and power over the Congress,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. He added: “Rahul wants the makeover exercise to be bloodless so that the new Congress feeds into the aspirations of the nation’s people.” Introspection . The leader clarified that the Gandhi scion will be away for “three or four weeks” on a “finding- himself journey” while he contemplates taking charge of the Congress. “The defeat in the 2014 general elections made him understand that India is changing rapidly. Rahul understands the aspirations and ambitions of the people and wants the party to be at the cutting edge of the nation’s new polity,” he added. But even some senior party men found the “introspection for the Congress’ course of action” reasoning hard to digest, especially since the crucial first week will see the tabling of the railway and general budgets. “It came as a surprise to me. I got the news from the official briefing. There must be some compelling reason for Rahul to take leave,” senior party leader Anil Shastri told Mail Today. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi dozes off in Parliament during a raging debate . #WhereisRahul was trending on social networking sites, where a deluge of tweets made light of the presumed fourth-generation heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty’s absence from the House. “Whatever we wanted to say has been said. I am not going to add anything to this,” Congress chief Sonia Gandhi told newspersons, adding: “Give him a few weeks.” As Rahul’s leave and its timing stirred up a controversy, party insiders explained that he was on an “atm chintan” (self-introspection) mission to draw up a blueprint for bringing the Congress back on track after the recent humiliating election defeats. The surprise leave plan was announced despite the Congress having earlier decided to target the NDA government in a big way on the land ordinance issue. Rahul himself was scheduled to lead a party agitation at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday. The expectation of Rahul attending the Jantar Mantar protest, coming two days after Anna Hazare’s demonstration at the same venue, had been building up as he had walked the dusty lanes of villages Bhatta-Parsaul in western Uttar Pradesh in 2011 to protest against forcible land acquisition of farmers. The Congress immediately jumped in to control the damage. “You think he is a fool that he did not know the risk involved (in being absent during the Budget Session and the obvious criticism it would follow)?” a senior AICC functionary asked. AICC meet in mind . “He (Rahul) believes that the AICC session (expected in the first week of April) is vital and he would like to give specific inputs on this. He wants to introspect about what happened with regard to the Congress in recent times and earlier,” party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said. “It has nothing to do with his role in the party. He has gone to reflect on party affairs and not on his role,” he added. One of the reasons cited by party sources for his action was that Rahul was miffed over the resistance he has been facing to his reform plans from “entrenched elements” in the Congress. But Singhvi said all the ideas germinated and nurtured by Rahul were being implemented in the party. The Congress remained tight-lipped about his whereabouts. The political grapevine has it that he could be anywhere from Europe to South East Asia. “All speculative questions are denied,” Singhvi said.","Social media fills with jokes about the disappearance of the Gandhi heir .

"Video footage has surfaced on social media of a group of people believed to be West Ham supporters chanting an anti-Semitic song as football became further submerged in racial controversy on Sunday. The highly-offensive chant in the video, filmed on the London Underground, appeared after West Ham's 2-2 draw with Tottenham and included the words: 'I’ve got a foreskin, how about you? F*****g Jew.' Anti-racism organisation Kick it Out released a short statement on Sunday night: 'Kick It Out has received several reports via social media about the footage and will be liaising with British Transport Police on the matter. In addition, we have been informed of a number of anti-Semitic tweets which we are reporting to the Police.' A spokesman for the British Transport Police said: 'We are aware of the footage and we are investigating it.' When contacted by Sportsmail, a West Ham spokesperson said the club would release a statement on Monday morning. On Friday, West Ham had posted a message from the joint-chairmen, David Sullivan and David Gold, to supporters going to Sunday’s match which reiterated their zero tolerance policy towards any fan found to be acting inappropriately. The statement read: 'We would also like to remind all fans attending the match at White Hart Lane that they will be acting as ambassadors for West Ham United and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards of our Club. 'Working with the Metropolitan Police, the Club will continue to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour and any fan found to be acting inappropriately - including racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic behaviour - will be punished to the full extent of the law and banned from attending matches.' This footage emerged on Twitter with a group of alleged West Ham fans chanting an anti-Semitic song . There is history of anti-Semitic controversy by West Ham fans at Tottenham. Two Hammers fans were cautioned and one was given a lifetime ban for racially-aggravated public order offences by police in 2012 after it was understood they made Nazi-style salutes during a match between the London rivals at White Hart Lane. West Ham's co-chairman David Gold, who is Jewish, said at the time the club has a 'zero tolerance' approach to supporters found to have made anti-Semitic taunts. It has been a dark week for the game with this sad event coming days after Chelsea fans were caught on film pushing a black man off the Metro in Paris on Tuesday before singing a racist chant. West Ham co-chairman David Gold, signing autographs, reminded fans of their conduct before the match . Chelsea fans were involved in a disgraceful incident on the Paris Metro on Tuesday . The incident happened ahead of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Paris St Germain on Tuesday, which ended 1-1. A former policeman, one of three men sought in connection with the allegedly racist incident, has apologised. Richard Barklie, 50, accepts he was there but said through his lawyer: ‘He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that.’ Meanwhile, Brighton and Hove Albion confirmed on Sunday that one fan had been arrested having used racist language at the Amex stadium. A club statement released by Championship side Brighton on Sunday confirmed another racist incident within football: 'Brighton & Hove Albion can confirm two arrests were made at yesterday's match against Birmingham City: one on suspicion of use of racist language, in relation to an historic offence; and one for throwing a smoke bomb onto the pitch from the away end,' said the club's statement.

"Prince Philip was legally a knight for more than a fortnight before Tony Abbott revealed his captain's call to the country on Australia Day. The prime minister's office first sought advice about giving the Queen's husband a knighthood in November 2014, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet officials confirmed on Monday. They also revealed the Letters Patent for the Order of Australia had to be amended because the Duke of Edinburgh was not an Australian citizen, making him an 'honorary' knight only. Scroll down for video . Ridiculed: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) decided to award a knighthood to Prince Philip (right) It was also necessary to place Prince Philip ahead of Prince Charles in the order of precedence. Mr Abbott sent a cover letter to the Queen with the amended Letters Patent in mid-December. The Queen agreed to the recommendation to knight her husband on January 7, 2015. Cabinet minister Eric Abetz told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday that he only found out about the knighthood when it was announced publicly on January 26. According to the ABC, Mr Abbott said In a speech at the National Press Club this month that he accepted the decision was a 'captain's call', and he 'probably overdid it on awards'. 'I just want to make it clear that all awards in the Order of Australia will henceforth be entirely a matter for the Order of Australia Council,' he said. Mr Abbott, when asked by Labor during question time why he didn't tell his senior colleagues in November of the knighthood, said Order of Australia honours did not go to cabinet. it has been revealed that Tony Abbot knew he was going to award Prince Philip with the knighthood two weeks before the news was released . 'Simple as that,' he said. The Order of Australia Council, and not the prime minister of the day, will now have sole responsibility for creating knights and dames. When the announcement broke on Australia Day, Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended his decision to honour the Duke of Edinburgh with a knighthood, despite widespread backlash from Cabinet colleagues. Mr Abbott faced a storm of criticism and was accused of creating a 'time warp' by awarding a member of Britain's royal family the country's highest honour. Cabinet members said the Prime Minister did not consult with any of them before making his decision, with one senior politician claiming he thought it was an April's Fool's Day joke. But some of the country's senior politicians, along with many Twitter users, aired their opposition to the announcement.. The Patent for the Order of Australia had to be amended because the Duke of Edinburgh was not an Australian citizen, making him an 'honorary' knight . The government head of the Northern Territory, Adam Giles, said he did not think the news was serious on first reading. 'I woke up this morning and read the wires and I thought it was April Fool's Day,' he said. 'I think it takes away from the legitimacy of the knighthood role. I think it makes a bit of a joke in a range of areas.' Speaking to the ABC, Mr Giles made it clear that he was opposed to the knighthood. 'It's Australia Day,' he said. 'We're not a bunch of tossers, let's get it right.' he said.","Prince Philip was made a knight two weeks before it was announced .

"The national minimum wage is to rise by 20p an hour to £6.70, despite George Osborne suggesting last year it could hit £7. The Low Pay Commission has recommended the increase to ministers, the largest real terms rise since 2007. Ministers boasted it would take the hourly rate to its highest level in real terms since 2010, but it falls short of the idea it could hit £7 floated by the Chancellor a year ago. The Low Pay Commission set out its recommendation for the main minimum wage rate to rise to £6.70 from October . The Commission recommends the adult rate should rise to £6.70 in October, while it would rise to £5.30  for 18-20-year-olds, £3.87 for 16 and 17-year-olds and £2.80 for apprentices. In an interview in January last year, Mr Osborne suggested it could go higher. ‘If the minimum wage had kept in line with inflation it would be £7,' he said. ‘Because we’re fixing the economy, because we’re working through our plan, I believe Britain can afford above-inflation increases in the minimum wage and make sure we have a recovery for all and that work pays.’ The 20p rise is the largest real-terms increase in the minimum wage since 2007, and takes its real value three-quarters of the way back to its highest ever level. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'This would represent an annual pay rise of £416 for a full time worker on the minimum wage. 'If this recommendation were accepted, the value of the minimum wage would be higher than when we came to office in 2010 and we are now making good progress towards restoring the value it lost during the financial crisis. 'I will now study these recommendations and consult my Cabinet colleagues with a view to announcing the final rates in the next few weeks.' Mr Cable said the Low Pay Commission had to strike a 'delicate balance' between what is fair for workers and what is affordable for employers, without costing jobs. 'It does so impartially and without political interference. No government has ever rejected the main rates since it was established 15 years ago. It is important that it is able to continue to do its work 10 weeks before a general election.' Business Secretary Vince Cable said the rise was the biggest real terms increase since 2010, but falls short of the £7 that Chancellor George Osborne (right) hinted at last year . TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It is good that the minimum wage is set to go up more than average earnings, but if the recovery is really as strong and sustained as the Chancellor claims, the commission could have been braver and given Britain's lowest paid workers a bigger boost. 'We also need much bolder action to give those on the lowest pay a fair share of the recovery, including new modern wages councils to set higher minimum rates in industries where employers can afford to pay more.' Katja Hall, CBI deputy director-general, said: 'The LPC has struck a careful balance. As the economic recovery cements, the commission has reconciled a desire to reflect this in pay packets while recognising that productivity growth - the key to sustainable pay rises - remains weak. 'We welcome the commitment to review next year's rise if the improved business environment doesn't materialise. 'The national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of our time thanks to the independent recommendations of the commission, helping many low-paid workers without damaging their job prospects. 'Any artificial increase due to political expediency will help no one and ultimately damage one of the most successful government policies in recent years.' The Tories insisted the rise marked progress towards taking the minimum wage back to its pre-crash peak. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We've said we want to see above inflation increases in the minimum wage in order to start restoring it back to its real term peak, so it's good news that the Low Pay Commission have recommended exactly that. This builds on last year's rise which was the first real terms rise since Labour's great recession. 'Backing work with a rising minimum wage, income tax cuts and welfare reform is a core part of our long term economic plan and this is only possible because of the difficult decisions we've taken to get the economy moving. 'We'll now consider the LPC's recommendations in the usual way.'","Low Pay Commission announces planned rises for October this year .

"Many Australians who fight for the Islamic State will be stripped of their citizenship, the Prime Minister has announced, as part of tough new counter-terrorism laws. The dramatic pledge came as a review released today revealed more than thirty Australians have returned home after fighting for jihadist causes overseas. In a landmark national security address, Mr Abbott said the government will attempt to strip or suspend the citizenship of Australians with dual citizenship fighting overseas. The government is also exploring taking away some of the rights of jihadists who are sole Australian citizens, Mr Abbott said. Scroll down for video .

Mr Abbott revealed the government is developing amendments to the Citizenship Act to take strip or suspend dual national Australian jihadists' citizenship . The government will also work to restrict the rights of jihadists with sole Australian citizenship, including restricting their access to welfare . That could include restricting their access to welfare payments, to consular help and their ability to leave or return to Australia. 'The Islam-ist death-cult has declared war on the world,' Mr Abbott said during today's announcement. 'We cannot allow bad people to use our good nature against us.' He added that Sydney siege gunman Man Monis had been given the benefit of the doubt too many times, including with citizenship. Mr Abbott also confirmed that ASIO is currently investigating thousands of terror leads and suspects, with 400 people deemed high risk. 'That’s more than double the number a year ago,' Mr Abbott told the assembled crowd, which included top national security officers from the Australian Federal Police. A  crackdown on so-called 'hate preachers' and the appointment of a national counter-terrorism tsar were also announced. The public will have more information available to them about the country's current terror threat - which now sits at high - so they can better understand the system and its levels. Today's address follows the release of government's review of Sydney's Martin Place siege on Sunday, which revealed  crazed gunman Man Haron Monis 'slipped through the cracks of the system'.

'There is an ongoing and inevitable debate in a country such as ours … between the rights of the individual and the protection of the community,' he said. 'My judgment is that – while having always to respect both – the question of precisely where we draw the line in the era of terrorism will have to be reconsidered and the line may have to be redrawn.' Despite an apparent 18 calls to ASIO in the days leading up to December 15 when Monis took 18 people hostage in the Lindt Cafe, authorities had deemed him as not a threat. The inquiry report made a number of recommendations and Mr Abbott and NSW Premier Mike Baird said governments needed to learn lessons from the siege. The new counter terrorism mechanisms are aimed at stopping home grown terrorists like Khaled Sharrouf (left) and Mohamed Elomar . The announcement will come a day after an review into the Sydney siege was released . 'Plainly, this monster should not have been in our community,' Mr Abbott said. 'The difficulty is that while he was well and truly on a lot of radar screens, he was routinely assessed as not being a threat to himself or to the community. 'Plainly, at some stage he did become a threat. We obviously do need more checks and more scrutiny in the visa process, in the citizenship process.' The new counter-terrorism measures set to be announced on Monday are going to deal increasingly with 'home-grown terrorists', like Australia's most wanted jihadists Mohammed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf. The review found that despite multiple reports to ASIO about Monis, he slipped through the cracks of the system to hold hostages for nearly 17 hours on December 15 and 16 . Sharrouf and Elomar both fled Australia to join the Islamic State insurgents fighting in Syria and Iraq in 2013 and in July 2014 the Australian Federal Police issued arrest warrants for the disturbed pair. Sharrouf flew out of Sydney in December 2013 using his brother’s passport and was soon followed by his convert wife Tara Nettleton who brought their five children to the Middle East with her. The men gained notoriety as part of the more than 100 Australians who have joined Islamic State after they posted disturbing photos of themselves holding up decapitated heads of Syrian soldiers last year. Sharrouf even got his seven-year-old son to hold up the severed head of a soldier in the Syrian city of Raqqa, accompanied with the caption 'that's my boy', in an image that shocked the world.","Many Australians who fight for the Islamic State will be stripped of their citizenship, PM says .

"The best friend of a teenage boy, whose hilarious 'cat and lasers' yearbook photo was shared around the world, has spoken of her devastation following his suicide. Draven Rodriguez, 17, took his own life at home in Schenectady, New York last Thursday, his family confirmed. His friend Mariah Cherie Szlachetka, 18, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that although Draven may be known around the world as 'laser-cat boy' thanks to the offbeat portrait he created, she will remember him as a talented, intelligent friend who always put others before himself. Mariah Cherie Szlachetka, 18, (pictured left) with Draven Rodriguez. She told Daily Mail Online today that he was a talented friend who would be terribly missed. 17-year-old Draven committed suicide last week . Draven pictured in his hilarious cat-laser portrait which he petitioned his Schenectady, New York high school to be allowed into the yearbook. His friend said on Monday that he loved to make people laugh . Mariah, who is in her first year of college studying art, said she met Draven several years ago at the National Young Leaders State Conference. She said: 'It was apparent from the start that he was intelligent far beyond others his age. He made friends so easily, not just there but everywhere he went.' Despite living an hour away from each other in New York state, Mariah said that she and Draven talked often, sharing stories about their day, along with plenty of laughs. 'Many nights we sat up talking, helping one another work through the stress life brings,' she said. 'He attended my school's semi-formal my sophomore year as my date. Together, we attended the circus, went to the mall, saw movies, had sleepovers and went out to eat. 'I attended as many of his school events, such as concerts and club functions, as possible.' The pair dated for a short time but decided to be friends instead. Mariah said other dates she went on had to earn the 'Draven seal of approval'. Mariah said that she and Draven dated for a little while but remained close friends. She said: 'Many nights we sat up talking, helping one another work through the stress life brings' Mariah said that she was hardly surprised when the 'laser-cat' phenomenon exploded. Draven's wacky portrait, posing in a suit while cuddling his cat Mr Bigglesworth in front of criss-crossing laser beams, became a wildly popular meme last year, earning mentions on Jimmy Fallon and Ellen De Generes talk shows. Last September, Draven dreamed up the wacky 'laser-cat' portrait to be used in his Schenectady High School yearbook. At first, the school objected to Draven's request, so he started an online petition - which went global. The school relented and Draven's 'laser-cat' photo appeared on the school principal's page - and Principal Diane Wilkinson joining him in the shot with her chihuahua, Vivienne. 'I knew if he was going to be famous for anything someday, it would be for making people laugh,' Mariah told Daily Mail Online on Monday. 'I think that's how he wanted to be remembered, as someone who was able to make people smile.' The school principal Diane Wilkinson eventually relented to Draven's portrait - and even posed alongside him with her chihuahua Vivienne . The portraits  raised awareness for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and rescue animals. Draven also volunteered with the How to UnMake a Bully program, according to the Daily News, and Mariah had earlier posted on Facebook that Draven had 'been struggling for a long time'. Mariah said on Monday that Draven's loss was devastating to everyone who ever knew him. 'The world knows him as laser cat boy, but those that love him know him as a beautiful person, inside and out,' she said. 'We'll remember him as a talented, intelligent, quick-witted, well-rounded young man who always put others before himself. 'He will be missed dearly, and I'm so far beyond grateful to have been a part of his life.' His stepfather, Jonathan Stewart, told The Times-Union this weekend that although they cherished Draven's sense of humor what made him so special was his ability to make friends wherever he went. 'He had friends all over the country - people he'd met at youth-leadership conferences, online, just around town,' Mr Stewart added. Relatives and friends paid tribute to Draven's empathy, compassion and determination to complete anything he set his mind to. The senior taught himself to play guitar, joining a rowing team and learned to speak basic Russian. Draven is survived by his stepfather, his mother Melissa Petersen-Stewart, his 11-year-old sister Lily Stewart, and his father Eric Rodriguez. A private funeral service will be held on Friday in Colonie, New York. Draven was not only known for his wicked sense of humor but also his ability to make friends wherever he went, his stepfather said this weekend .","Draven Rodriguez, 17, took his own life at home in Schenectady, New York last Thursday, his family said .

"MPs have rejected proposals to ban abortions on the grounds of gender amid claims it would make it harder for women from Muslim communities to seek help. The change, in an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, was last night defeated by 291 votes to 201. The proposed ban was tabled by Tory MP Fiona Bruce but was dealt a major blow when shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper wrote to Labour MPs urging them to vote against it. The proposed ban was tabled by Tory MP Fiona Bruce but was dealt a major blow when shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (right) wrote to Labour MPs urging them to vote against it . Miss Cooper said that to support the change would make ‘vulnerable women’ less likely to have ‘open and honest conversations’ with doctors and nurses. David Cameron also said it could stop women being able to ‘avoid the certainty of genetic disease’. Last night’s vote centred on plans to make it crystal clear that sex-selective terminations are illegal. Critics insist that the existing legislation on the issue is confusing and that terminations based on the sex of the foetus are still going on in some communities. More than 100 MPs have put their name to the amendment tabled by Mrs Bruce, who said it was needed ‘to stop women being misled, to send a strong signal, and to provide an opportunity for Government help’. The TUC has urged Labour MPs to oppose a ban on  sex-selective abortion which will be debated today . But Miss Cooper claimed the move would make it impossible to terminate a child suffering from sex-specific abnormalities. In her letter to Labour MPs, she wrote: ‘Concerns have been raised that some women are put under intense pressure by their partners, families or communities to deliver male children.’ She added: ‘Fiona Bruce’s amendment will do little to alleviate the external pressures or coercion these women face, nor eradicate prejudices, customs and traditions which are based on the idea of the inferiority of women and which may amount to pressure to seek an abortion because of the sex of a foetus. ‘Some organisations have raised concern that Bruce’s amendment would simply make vulnerable women less likely to have open and honest conversations with healthcare professionals about their circumstances, making it harder to get them support.’ Tory MP Fiona Bruce has tabled an amendment which will clarify the law on gender-selective abortion . Miss Cooper instead called on Labour MPs to support a rival amendment which called for a thorough assessment of the evidence on sex-selective abortion, together with a new government plan to promote cultural change. At a Tory rally in Hastings, Mr Cameron said he supported the ‘status quo’ whereby abortion on gender grounds is not legal but could be allowed in some cases. ‘Now, there are very few circumstances, for example avoiding the certainty of genetic disease, that it might be allowed, so I support that,’ he said. ‘But in doing so, I hope that the abortion rules are properly policed and prosecutions and all the rest of it are carried out when the laws are broken.’ Miss Bruce’s amendment to the Serious Crime Bill attempted to make sure that nothing in the Abortion Act ‘is to be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child’. It would have meant that women who have abortions in these circumstances and the doctors who approve them could be liable for criminal prosecution. Last night Rani Bilkhu, director of Jeena International – which campaigns against sex-selective abortions – called the vote a ‘disgrace’. ‘This is an insult to the women we work with who have suffered under the burden of sex-selective abortion and have said they want clarity in the law,’ she said. ‘To think that a few Westminster bubble MPs could scupper such an important vote mocks the very fabric of British democracy. It is a disgrace.’","Prime Minister insists existing law on abortions is strong enough .

"The people living on the Arctic Circle are often mysterious to the world's southerners, obscured by coverings of fur and snow. But now the lives of  those who call the  far north home have been captured by London-based photographer Cristian Barnett. The photographer traveled to the eight countries along the 66 degree  33 minutes north latitude marker, taking pictures of the inhabitants for his book Life on the Line. Scroll down for video . Cristian Barnett made more than ten trips to the Arctic Circle over eight years and met characters including Hans Bengston in Sweden, a 'master of glibness and sausage poet' Mr Barnett met people along the 66 degree 33 minute north line that were as diverse as reindeer herders and hair dressers. Brett Connor (pictured) of Kotzebue, Alaska, has a hot tub in his living room because it is so cold outside . Artic peoples Mr Barnett met include the Gwichin, Saami, Khanti, Nenets, Evenks, Yakuts and Inuit. Above, Mike Ivaluntanar of Repulse Bay, Canada, stands on a giant whalebone . Mr Barnett visited more than 20 towns and villages over his long project. Above, Lars Anders Hakansson, a tanner, sits with his bear. Mr Barnett said the eight-year project started when he looked at a map and was 'intrigued by the mysterious dotted line that dissected apparently vast empty spaces'. However, after traveling making eleven trips to 23 towns and villages, he was able to meet members of Arctic peoples such as the Gwichin, Saami, Khanti, Nenets, Evenks, Yakuts and Inuit. Much of the photography of the Arctic focuses on natural phenomena such as the Aurora Borealis, but more than 4million people live within the circle, according to Arctic.ru. Looking to capture the extraordinary lives of people who did not live exactly on the line, the photographer expanded his scope to include some individuals within 35 miles of the Arctic Circle. He encountered a man who described himself as a 'master of glibness and sausage poet' and everyone from reindeer herders to hair dressers. Though the expeditions to the Arctic Circle included temperatures as high as 68 degrees F, Mr Barnett also had trouble with his camera when it fell below 5 degrees .

The people of the Arctic adapt to the tough conditions and thrive in their environment. Above, Ivar Sigthorsson of Raufarhofn, Iceland tries a new face protector . Mr Barnett traveled to the eight countries that the Arctic Circle crosses: the US, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Above, Anton holds his Dalmatian on the Yamal Peninsula, Russia . Many Arctic towns and cities rely on local rivers, though they remain frozen solid for most of the year. And Mr Barnett managed not to be frozen  in the frigid north of the US, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Winters above the arctic circle see very little or no sunlight, while in summers the sun never sets. He experienced temperatures as high as 68 degrees F in Jokkmokk, Sweden, according to Slate. The cold did cause troubles for his camera, though, which had problems working below 5 degrees. 'It's not actually an extreme environment in a lot of cases,' he says. 'Mostly it's not that difficult of a place to live' he said. However Mr Barnett also encountered the troubles of people often forgotten about by people in warmer, less isolated climates, such as the Inuit people in northern Canada. The Arctic Circle has more than 4million residents. Above, Anatoly Galushkin in Zhigansk, Russia, demonstrates acrobatic martial arts . Storm-chasers Mark Robinson and George Kourounis live on Sunshine Fjord, Baffin Island, in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut .

The people that Mr Barnett visited in their Arctic homes were hospitable. Above, a farmer's wife takes a break from cow-milking in Knjazaja Guba, Russia . His guide and his family used to survive on subsistence hunting, but now faced joblessness and a 'crumbling prefabricated house', according to the Barents Observer. People where Mr Barnett went were hospitable, though. The vegetarian was offered and drank reindeer blood with the Nenets people of Siberia, he told the Arctic Journal. Mr Barnett and his translator were the seventh and eighth foreigners to visit Zhigansk, in northeastern Russia. He said that far from getting a frosty reception, they were 'treated like royalty'. His work as been featured in several exhibitions in the UK. The photographer said that his next project may involve taking pictures along the straight line that extends from the door of his house around the world.

"The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC’s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his ‘shame’ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a ‘classic case of tax avoidance’. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax . He said there was ‘no tax advantage’ and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank’s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: ‘There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.’ Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC’s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said: ‘We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. ‘It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Douglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn’t normally how large organisations can run.’ HSBC has been criticised as being ‘too big to manage’ after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver’s watch. It was fined £1.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined £400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves.’ ‘I would expect to die abroad,’ he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was ‘astonished’ that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. ‘Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance,’ he said. ‘But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. ‘There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.’ Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a ‘source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC’. Despite this he received a £7.6million pay package last year, including a £1.3million bonus. This was a drop from his £8million package in 2013 – his bonus was cut by £500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to £12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from £2.6billion to £2.4billion.","Stuart Gulliver's bonuses allegedly paid via Panama-registered company .

"Victim: Taylynn Devaughn, 2, died Sunday after being mauled by a dog in a Pittsburgh suburb . A two-year-old Pennsylvania girl has died after being mauled by a dog in a Pittsburgh suburb. The dog attacked Taylynn Devaughn inside a home in West Mifflin -- located about 10 miles southeast of downtown Pittsburgh -- around 8:45 pm Sunday. Responders rushed the toddler to Jefferson Memorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 9.30pm Sunday,CBS reports. 'I came out of the kitchen and the dog dropped the baby' Corey Devaughn, the child's father, told WPXI. 'His name was Jake and my baby was gone.' West Mifflin police Chief Kenneth Davies told the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette that the two-year-old, of Forest Hills, was visiting the home on Fleetwood Drive when she was attacked. Police say the child had been bitten several times by the dog and Devaughn said that, though he quickly called 911, there wasn't much medics could do, according to WPXI. Homicide detectives say the dog is a pit bull mix and the Washinton Post reports that the dog is being quarantined for at least 10 days at a local kennel. County Lt. Andrew Schurman said that a district attorney will determine whether charges will be filed. Devaughn said he doesn't blame the dog's owners and that Sunday was the second time the toddler had been around the pit bull. 'We know deep down inside, she's looking down on us,' Devaughn said. 'She has a lot of people that love her a lot. People all over love my baby. It is unknown whether the toddler was related to or friends with the family that owned the dog. Scroll down for video .

An autopsy is scheduled for Monday and a district attorney is now reviewing the case. The investigation is ongoing. The tragic incident has prompted many Facebook users to take to WPXI's page to voice their opinion about the attack. However, the comments quickly escalated to a debate about pit bulls. Many blamed the tragic incident on the type of dog. One Facebook user described pit bulls as 'naturally aggressive animals' while some held that the blame belonged to the child's parents, and others believed the fault belonged to the owner of the dog. Blame: Devaughn said he doesn't blame the dog's owners and that Sunday was the second time the toddler had been around the pit bull . Mother: Tiffany Golden (photographed), the child's mother, has not yet made public comment about the incident . Rushed: Responders rushed the toddler to Jefferson Memorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 9.30pm Sunday . One user wrote: 'I don't understand the obsession with people saying pit bulls are great pets. Yeah the owners have something to do with their behavior but they are naturally aggressive animals. You will never see my children around any pit bull, even a 'well behaved' one with good owners.' Another wrote that people should not 'bully the breed.' 'All dogs have teeth and are capable of doing damage to a small child!!,' the Facebook user wrote. 'It's the (sic) parents responsibility to keep both children and pets safe and happy!'

"Three children aged four to eight have been killed and their mother left critically injured after being struck by pickup truck while crossing a busy Oregon intersection, police have said. The four victims, who are yet to be identified, were using a crosswalk on Main Street  in Springfield on Sunday evening when they were hit by the large silver Ford truck, which was traveling eastbound. The children, thought to be two boys and a girl, were declared dead at the scene after suffering devastating injuries. Their mother, meanwhile, was rushed to an area hospital, where she remains in a critical condition. Killed: The mother, identified as Courtney, was pictured on GoFundMe with each of her children . Condolence: The fundraising page has amassed some $11,000 for the family - believed to be pictured above at a theme park . Victims: The fundraising page, purportedly set up by a cousin, pictured what appears to be all three of the children in turn, at the beach with their mother . A GoFundMe page set up to cover funeral expenses and medical expenses names the mother as Courtney, but does not give a surname or identify the children. The children's father, who was not involved in the crash, was named as James. The page added that the children were aged seven, five and four years old. In tributes at the scene, flowers and stuffed animals piled up around a family photograph showing the mother, father and three children. The tragedy occurred at the same intersection where pedestrian Daniel Ortiz-Raynaga was fatally struck by a car two months ago. He was carried on the vehicle's roof for 11 blocks as it fled.

Speaking of the latest crash, local Julianna Bjurling told the Eugene Register-Guard: 'I was at home and I heard this ""thump"". By the time I got out here, the kids hadn’t been covered yet. The 44-year-old, who knew the woman and her three children, added that the driver came to a halt immediately after the crash. He then climbed out of his truck and stared at the scene, she said. He is said to be cooperating with investigators and no arrests nor citations have yet been made. Police were called to Main Street at 54th at around 4.50pm following reports of a crash. Within minutes, Springfield Police and the Eugene-­Springfield Fire Department were on the scene. A major traffic accident investigation team later arrived at the intersection. Two hours on, the bodies of the children remained in the road so police could reconstruct the crash as accurately as possible. They were covered at around 7pm. According to police, the four victims had been at a small grocery and were in or in the vicinity of the marked crosswalk, heading home, when they were hit.

"A tugboat captain has been jailed after one of his crew died during a violent storm. Martin Richley, who also owns the 31ft tug, admitted putting his crew at serious risk when they sailed out on February 3, 2013. They were towing a motor cruiser from the River Medway to Brighton when the towline snapped in the severe weather. Steven Trice, 55, from Medway in Kent, attempted to reattach the line, but fell overboard and was lost at sea. His body was recovered 11 weeks later near Beachy Head, East Sussex. A sailor died after falling overboard when trying to reattach a towline on the tug. His body was found 11 weeks later at the foot of cliffs at Beachy Head, Eastbourne (pictured above) Richley, 39, was sentenced to eight months in prison at Southampton Crown Court on Friday. Earlier the Marine Accident Investigation Branch described Mr Trice's attempt to reattach the line as 'extremely dangerous'. 'It was a desperate and ill-considered measure brought about by the use of poor towing practices, a disregard of the weather forecasts and a lack of planning, risk assessment and emergency preparedness, its report said. In passing sentence His Honour Judge Ralls Q.C said . 'This was a catalogue of disasters, Mr Richly was prepared to take a chance*. it was a disaster waiting to happen after a series of bad decisions.' Captain Andrew Rudge, MCA Area Operations Manager said; . 'This was a tragic incident that should not have happened. Mr Richley should not have accepted to take on the tow as he was ill equipped, unqualified and his vessel was not suitable.'

"Maria Spruce ran up a bill of £3,500 on the credit card for Wolverhampton City Council. She claimed she was in financial difficulty but was found out while holidaying in Australia . A disgraced council worker who used the authority's credit card to run up a bill of £3,500 when she got into financial difficulties was found out while she holidayed in Australia. Maria Spruce, 40, was supposed to use the Wolverhampton council credit card to pay for work-related goods but instead used it for her own means, buying items for her family including several mobile phones. However, despite claiming she turned to the card because she claimed she had run into financial problems, Spruce still managed to fund a holiday to Australia and her fraud was uncovered while she enjoyed herself Down Under. The electoral registration assistant now faces prison after she admitted, at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court, one charge of fraud by position. Spruce spent £3,517 on the card. Roger Bleazard, prosecuting, told the court that Spruce had run into financial difficulties and turned to the card to buy personal items. She spent the cash on herself and her family between September 1, 2013 and January 21 this year, buying several mobile phones. Spruce had worked at the authority for five-and-a-half years and was immediately suspended after the fraud was uncovered. Speaking after the hearing Councillor Paul Sweet, Wolverhampton City Council cabinet member for governance and performance, said the council had launched its own internal disciplinary investigation. He added: 'The fraud that Maria Spruce admitted in court was uncovered by the council while she was away on holiday last November. 'She was immediately suspended from her role as an electoral registration assistant and the matter was reported to the police. 'Following her guilty plea before the magistrates, a full disciplinary hearing is now scheduled to take place. Spruce was supposed to use the authority credit card for work-related items at Wolverhampton City Council . Spruce apparently used the company card because she was in financial difficulty, but holidayed in Australia . 'City of Wolverhampton Council has a zero tolerance policy towards fraud and will always take action.' Spruce, from Bilston, in the West Midlands, was granted unconditional bail and will be sentenced on March 20 at Wolverhampton Crown Court. He guilty plea comes just weeks after Anthony McHale, 56, set up and managed six false housing benefit payment accounts for fictitious people at the same authority. He swindled the council out of £32,000 and was branded a 'dishonest crook' by a judge last month. McHale was handed a 20-month prison sentence suspended for two years with 300 hours unpaid work.","Maria Spruce was Wolverhampton council electoral registration assistant .

"Jeremy Clarkson has walked into another row after he claimed people in Liverpool 'earn less, die more quickly and have fewer jobs' than people in the South of England. The Top Gear host wrote that houses in the city were 'worth the square root of sod all' after visiting for one of his programme's live shows. The mayor of Liverpool has now hit back, branding the highly-paid BBC presenter an 'oaf and a buffoon'. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson has been criticised by the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, over comments about the city . As he travels the country as part of the Top Gear Live tour, Clarkson wrote a piece claiming 'the north of England has never been more different from the south'. He mocked a restaurant and hotel in Liverpool because staff didn't know what a kipper or Tabasco sauce were and poked fun at people like himself for expecting the North to be like the South. The 54-year-old said that on previous visits to the city, he heard constant burglar alarms during the night, witnessed a knifeman 'run amok' in a restaurant and found a 'dead' girl in his hotel corridor. He then wrote: 'People up there earn less, die more quickly, have fewer jobs and live in houses that are worth the square root of sod all.' He added: 'For those who live in the south the north has become ""abroad"".' His views  have angered some locals, with Mayor Joe Anderson today vowing to complain to the BBC about the comments, which were published in Clarkson's Sunday Times column. In an article about the city, Clarkson joked that houses in the North are worth 'the square root of sod all' The comments were made after Clarkson visited the city as part of his show's Top Gear Live tour of the UK . Mr Anderson said: 'The things he is saying are trying to stigmatise the city and I think the BBC needs to ask questions, especially when he was in the city on a stay that was presumably being paid for by them. 'I'm not sure many people in Liverpool will lose much sleep if he doesn't visit again.' After the mayor's comments were reported by the Liverpool Echo, Clarkson defended his comments and hit out at what he called the 'local rag'. He tweeted: 'People of Liverpool. Read what I actually wrote. Including the bits the f***tards on the local rag left out. Shocking journalism.' Top Gear has a history of sparking rows. In 2008, the show was rapped by the BBC Trust for showing Clarkson and fellow presenter James May sipping gin and tonic at the wheel during a stunt. During a press conference in Australia in February 2009, Clarkson branded then-UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' In 2011, Richard Hammond was discussing a Mexican sports car and suggested that vehicles reflect the national characteristics of the country they are from. Clarkson was found to have deliberately employed an offensive word after saying a bridge in Burma had a 'slope on it' Hammond said: 'Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat.' The Mexican ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza made a formal complaint to the BBC and called on the presenters to make a public apology for stirring 'bigoted feelings against the Mexican people'. Then in March last year, Clarkson said during a two-part Burma special: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards them on their makeshift bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. Viewers complained about the use of the word 'slope', which is considered a derogatory term for people of Asian descent. Ofcom launched an investigation into the Burma TV special and ruled in July that the presenter had 'deliberately employed the offensive word to refer to the Asian person'. Clarkson also had to apologise after unscreened footage showed him using the n-word during filming . Clarkson also had to apologise when unscreened footage emerged of him mumbling the n-word while reciting the children's nursery rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe' to choose between two cars. Last year ended with the motoring show's crew forced to flee Argentina after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some suggested could refer to the Falklands conflict of 1982.

"A policeman who preyed on drunk students to film up their skirts with a secret camera has been spared jail despite being branded a 'figure of national shame'. Manchester PC Kevin Dwyer, 39, faces losing his job of 13 years and his pension after a court heard he filmed one victim in full uniform while pretending to investigate a crime. The disgraced officer targeted young women who were drunk and sometimes vomiting - winning their trust by saying he was a first aider before aiming the camera up their skirts. Voyeur: PC Kevin Dwyer, 39, left on duty and right outside court, used a secret camera hidden in his pocket to film up the skirts of drunk students. He was spared jail today at Manchester Crown Court . The voyeur also twice crept up to a window to film a young couple having sex inside a building, Manchester Crown Court heard. Today a judge spared him jail and decided not to impose a fine, unpaid work or compensation. Instead he was handed a three-year community order which will involve him attending a sex offenders' course to address his behaviour. He was also handed a five-year sexual offences prevention order which stops him filming up women's skirts 'without their consent'. The PC was also told he must make any camera, video camera or image-storing memory card available to police officers on request. Judge Robert Atherton told him: 'You chose to go at a time when students were likely to be on the streets and perhaps in conditions when they would not realise or properly interpret what you were doing.' Dwyer, who targeted women in Chester, Warrington and Manchester, is suspended and faces losing his job - together with his police pension - after formal misconduct hearings. Disguise: PC Dwyer, used a helmet to hide his face at a previous hearing, and will be sentenced today . The disgraced PC went to desperate lengths to avoid press photographers outside Manchester Crown Court, arriving for today's hearing in a motorcycle helmet. After he pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism and ten of outraging public decency on Friday, he sneaked through an emergency exit - which set off the court's fire alarm. He swore at one reporter as he entered the courtroom today and was warned he would be jailed if he left court through an emergency exit again. 'Mr Dwyer went through one of the emergency exits thereby setting off the fire alarm without the consent of anyone,' the judge added. 'I regard that as reprehensible.' His lawyer Patrick Thompson apologised and said: 'He is at the moment a figure of national shame and did not want it to get any worse.' Dwyer, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, was Hull firefighter for two years before joining the police in 2002 and was working patrolling Manchester city centre when he was arrested in May last year. When officers searched his computer equipment at home they found a cache of secret films taken by him on a Sony camcorder. Detectives seized a recording device in the pocket of his police uniform trousers and traced his Renault Megane car making repeated late-night trips to Chester. Justin Hayhoe, prosecuting, told the court: 'Examination of his computers revealed this was a man who had a fascination with Chester and areas frequented by students. 'He seemed to target women wearing high heels, short skirts, short dresses or short shorts. 'When he was interviewed he said he, 'Absolutely admired a great pair of legs and a short skirt. The fitter the better'.' Internet searches by Dwyer centred on Chester student accommodation, spy cameras, how best to record in low-light and areas of Chester covered by CCTV cameras. He had also done similar searches on students and student areas in Sheffield and the Stoke area of Staffordshire. The court heard he carried out his crimes over a seven-month period between October 2013 and the date of his arrest. Desperate measures: Dwyer went to extreme lengths to avoid press photographers, sneaking out from a hearing last Friday through an emergency exit - which had the consequence of setting off the fire alarm . He had approached one 'squatting' victim while and told her he was investigating a crime so he could film between her legs with a camera stashed in his police uniform pocket. Other footage he took included filming up the skirts of his victims in takeaways, standing below women queuing up the steps of a nightclub and gangs of girls queuing for taxis. The court heard he committed the filming offences by using distraction techniques and he would often pretend to be taking on a mobile telephone. On other occasions he would engage women in conversation, asking to get past them or suggesting he was a first aider who could assist them when they were intoxicated and had been vomiting. Mr Hayhoe said Dwyer would often follow and film women who had been drinking and were vulnerable. He added: 'In relation to the women he selected, they were all young women, out on nights out, they were expecting they could go out, enjoy an evening out and not have their privacy invaded by this man filming up their skirts.' Dwyer's activities first came to the attention of police after reports of a man acting suspiciously at 1am in the Green Lane area of Chester. The defendant did not tell the officers called to the scene he was a fellow policeman and said he was researching properties in the area to let out to students. But police later found out he repeatedly visited the student areas of Chester - always late at night or the early hours of the morning. In May last year he was stopped again by police officers in Chester who were suspicious about what he was up to. Police searched his Renault Megane and found 'lubricant and clothing' but Dwyer, who said he was a council worker was again allowed to go on his way. City centre: Dwyer targeted sometimes vomiting women in Chester, Warrington and Manchester (above) Mr Thompson, defending, said Dwyer's behaviour was 'sad and pathetic'. Detective Inspector Chris Packer, from the force's Counter Corruption Unit, said: 'These videos were filmed without the knowledge of his victims, showing a complete lack of regard for their privacy, for his own sexual pleasure. 'The conduct of former PC Kevin Dwyer fell well short of what is expected of a police officer. 'Police officers, staff and the communities of Greater Manchester would be appalled by his actions, which detract from the hard work that our officers and staff do on a daily basis. 'GMP expects the very highest standards of all its officers and staff. They should be honest and act with integrity and should not compromise or abuse their position.'","PC Kevin Dwyer sought out girls in Chester, Warrington and Manchester .

"Union leaders are telling MPs to vote against a proposed ban on aborting babies on the grounds of their gender. A document circulated by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) argued that the amendment to make sex-selective abortions illegal would ‘divide communities’. It also suggests there can be ‘compelling circumstances’ to allow abortion of female foetuses – such as if a woman is at risk of domestic abuse. The TUC has urged Labour MPs to oppose a ban on  sex-selective abortion which will be debated today . The unions’ intervention into the debate provoked a major row last night ahead of today’s vote on the issue. Religious groups, including Asian community leaders and representatives of the Muslim, Hindu and Sikh faiths, said there was no division on the practice and that they all viewed sex- selective abortion as abhorrent. There was also a furious reaction from MPs, including some from Union-backed Labour, who demanded to know why the TUC was telling them how to vote on an issue of conscience. Some senior Tories accused the unions of trying to use their financial muscle and influence over Labour to manipulate voting. The practice of aborting babies because of their gender has long been suspected to exist among some Asian communities, in which sons are said to be more valued than daughters. Tory MP Fiona Bruce’s amendment, which has been promised support by 100 MPs, attempts to clear up confusion about whether the practice is illegal. It seeks to establish in law that ‘nothing in section one of the Abortion Act 1967 is to be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child’. Tory MP Fiona Bruce has tabled an amendment which will clarify the law on gender-selective abortion . But Labour MPs have been urged to ‘consider opposing this amendment’ by the TUC. An email signed by the Congress’s Westminster representative Isobel Larkin said there was no evidence to suggest sex-selective abortion has been happening and that official guidance already says an abortion cannot be authorised by gender alone. It added: ‘The amendment does not attempt to address the root causes of deeply entrenched gender discrimination but rather has divided communities.’ Last night, Labour MP Mary Glindon said: ‘To [suggest] the amendment is dividing communities is unsubstantiated ... they won’t have any evidence.’ Tory MP Julian Brazier said: ‘It is a great shame that the TUC, which represents the lion’s share of the paymasters of the Labour Party, has chosen to intervene in this way.’ Miss Larkin claimed the support of several community groups, but only named one specifically Asian organisation – the Newham Asian Women’s Project. The briefing paper sent round by the TUC suggested it could be right in some circumstances for a doctor to approve sex-selective abortion – for example, if a woman did not want a girl for ‘cultural’ reasons and could be abused by her husband if she kept the baby. It's offensive rubbish, say Asians . Dr Jafer Qureshi said toleration of sex-selective abortion would lead to the slippery slope of 'designer babies' The UK’s major Asian faith groups were last night united in condemning the union’s abortion warning. Muslim, Sikh and Hindu representatives all gave their full support for gender-selective abortions to be criminalised. And they attacked the TUC’s suggestion that it should not be outlawed because of ‘complexities’ to do with cultural issues as ‘ridiculous rubbish’. Dr Majid Katme of the Islamic Medical Association said: ‘The claim that the amendment is divisive is ridiculous. It’s rubbish. ‘No-one will accept that. How will this divide communities? This is upsetting only the pro-choice people, that’s all.’ He added: ‘All the major faith groups in the UK are strongly united against this criminal act of killing girls in abortion. ‘Why in a civilised society do you target girls to be killed? Why are we going the way of India and China in targeting girls?’ Bal Sandhu, of the Sikh Council UK, agreed and described the TUC’s opposition to the ban as ‘outrageous’. She said: ‘They shouldn’t be saying that. I am absolutely shocked. This is completely out of the TUC’s remit. It is very offensive.’ In response to the claim that there might be ‘cultural’ reasons for allowing a gender-specific abortion, she said: ‘It is appalling that they can make such generalised statements, that they can say something like that. We are in support of sex-selective abortions being a criminal offence because it will act as a deterrent and people might think twice. ‘It doesn’t mean that there will be wife- battering as a result. It will simply send out a clear message that sex-selective abortions are illegal, unacceptable and will not be tolerated in this country.’ Dr Jafer Qureshi, Muslim co-chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, said: ‘Toleration of sex-selective abortion would put Britain on the slippery slope to designer families. ‘Islamic teaching is very clear on this – it is not allowed, period. I am extremely worried about this being abused.’ Hindu leaders also spoke out against the practice, saying they had been campaigning on the issue for years. In a letter on the Bruce amendment, members of the Hindu Council UK and National Council of Hindu Temples UK wrote: ‘We are all united in the belief that sex-selective abortion must end. We were campaigning for this long before Fiona Bruce or anyone else became interested.’","Tory MP Fiona Bruce is seeking a ban on gender-selective abortions .

"Two weeks after her 41st birthday, Sue Cook’s life changed for ever. She was on a pheasant shoot when she was injured in a freak accident. A woman standing near her failed to unload the unused cartridges in her gun. As she put it away, both barrels went off. ‘I looked down and stared at my left wellington boot. I couldn’t see blood, but it appeared to be on fire,’ says Sue, now 45, a marketing specialist in Stamford, Lincolnshire. Scroll down for video . ‘It is excruciating. I have a constant burning sensation down through my leg and foot, even though neither of them is there any more,' said Sue Cook who can still feel her left foot and leg . ‘Then I heard this terrible screaming — it was me. I was in agony.’ Sue was taken by helicopter to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. The lead shot had smashed her lower leg and foot to a pulp. Two days later, she woke up to discover her left leg had been amputated through the middle of the knee joint. Four years on, she is struggling to cope — and not just because she has lost a leg. For though it isn’t there, the missing leg causes Sue constant pain. ‘It is excruciating,’ she says. ‘I have a constant burning sensation down through my leg and foot, even though neither of them is there any more. 'The only thing that has given any relief is acupuncture. Even then, the pain comes straight back within a couple of hours.’ 'The only thing that has given any relief is acupuncture,' said Sue . Sue has phantom limb pain, a medically recognised condition that means pain messages are transmitted to the brain from a body part that is no longer there. Every year, more than 6,000 people have limbs amputated, and eight out of ten will suffer from phantom limb pain. The majority of amputations are the result of type 2 diabetes or complications of obesity and smoking, as they can destroy the circulation, causing body parts to die. Doctors do not understand why phantom limb pain happens. It is thought to be caused by damaged nerves leading to misfiring signals in the brain and the emotional trauma suffered when the limb was lost. ‘Some say the pain is like having boiling water poured over the limb,’ says Dr Fergus Jepson, a former orthopaedic surgeon turned rehabilitation specialist. He runs a mobility rehab centre at the Royal Preston Hospital in Lancashire and is a national expert on phantom limb pain. He says strong painkillers can help, including tranquillisers such as diazepam, patches releasing anaesthetic drugs and capsaicin cream based on chillies, which produces numbness after the burning sensation wears off. Many patients use mirror-box therapy: they re-programme the jumbled nerves in their brains by moving their intact leg next to a mirror. Seeing an image of the leg tricks the brain into thinking the missing limb is back. This can stop the pain signals and lead to permanent relief, though the mechanism for this remains unknown. Other amputees use ‘stump socks’ made from a material that blocks electromagnetism, a controversial technique that seems to stop nerve stimulation. But Dr Jepson says hypnosis is the most effective treatment. ‘Patients talk about their foot being trapped in a painful, twisted position or stuck in a vice. 'By moving it in their mind, they can release it,’ he says. ‘Sometimes, we can use radio-frequency waves to destroy the malfunctioning nerve. 'But they also need to process their anger and trauma at the amputation, which can have a huge effect on the physical pain they feel.’ However, for some patients the pain is difficult to treat. Mother-of-two Kelly Dixon, from Saltburn, North Yorkshire, lost a leg due to nerve damage. She was on her side for a ten-hour operation to repair a shoulder injury following a car accident in 2007. The shoulder was fine, but the nerve down the side of her body was compressed, causing untreatable pain from her left foot. The foot was amputated in 2011 — an extreme, but medically recognised solution to intractable pain. Sue has phantom limb pain, a medically recognised condition that means pain messages are transmitted to the brain from a body part that is no longer there . However, phantom limb pain was worse than the previous pain and nothing she tried seemed to help. In late 2012, Kelly begged to be given a controversial spinal implant, designed to block pain signals from her leg to her brain. The device, being trialled in five British centres, involves two implanted wires connected to points in the spinal cord, which lead to a battery under the skin of the stomach. Electrical pulses to block pain signals from the damaged nerve are turned up or down by a device like a TV remote control. The operation carries risks of paralysis and damage to bowel and bladder function, but so far the results have been good. Kelly, 35, says it was a risk she was willing to take: ‘My life was over before this. I was on so much morphine I could hardly function.’ Sam Eldabe, a specialist in anaesthesia and pain management at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, where Kelly was treated, said the implant tackles complex regional pain syndrome — pain from a phantom source. ‘This device gives us the ability to target pain and neutralise specific areas,’ he says. ‘It is producing much better results than anything we have used before.’ Meanwhile, Sue has started a course of mirror therapy. ‘It is working so far,’ she says. ‘The idea of living with this pain for the rest of my days doesn’t bear thinking about.’","Every year, more than 6,000 people have limbs amputated .

"An eight-year-old Oklahoma girls' room is filled with thousands of roaches, but the pests don't bug her at all. Second grader Shelby Counterman, from outside Tulsa, has been taking care of a colony of Madagascar hissing cockroaches for the last five years as her pets. She began with a small batch of male cockroaches, but she later decided that she wanted them to breed and brought in females. Scroll down for video . Shelby Counterman, 8, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, has kept roaches for five years after receiving a small batch . The girl contacted her local news anchor after hearing that the journalist hated the animal she keeps as a pet . The African insects, which have no wings and a single pair of antennae, began multiplying exponentially. The girl's mother Meg says that her daughter first became interested in creepy crawlies when she was 18-months old. However the invertebrate keeper was shocked when she heard a local news anchor, News on 6's LeAnne Taylor, say that she detested the hissing bugs. Shelby sent a picture to the journalist and invited her to fight her fears and meet her beloved pets. The elementary school student keeps her pets in special plastic containers, as well as aquariums with Vaseline linings to keep her prized possessions from escaping and scampering around the house. The cockroaches are kept in plastic containers as well as aquariums with Vaseline on the edges so the animals can't escape . The Countermans also keep a bearded dragon lizard named Toothless in case any members of the bug collection, which also includes Indian cockroaches, escape. Madagascar hissing cockroaches are one of the largest species of roach, and can grow up to three inches in length, according to Orkin. Males make a hissing sound for mating by expelling air through slits in its stomach, though the bugs also make their namesake noise when they are alarmed. The scavengers, active mostly at night, eat fruits and vegetables and can live for as long as five years. Some states place restrictions on the importation of the roaches because of fear they could become an invasive species in the wild. After atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, rumors spread that only cockroaches survived the blasts. To test the popular myth, which was spread during the Cold War, the team behind Discovery's Mythbusters subjected cockroaches to three levels of radioactive metal cobalt 60. They started with a dose of 1,000 radon units (rads) which could kill a person in 10 minutes, then upped the dose to 10,000 - the strength of the blast at Hiroshima - and 100,000 rads for a handful of unfortunate insects. They monitored the cockroaches for 30 days, looking for signs of cellular damage. After a month, half of the insects exposed to the lowest dose were alive and 10 per cent of those exposed to 10,000 rads survived. The experiment seems to confirm the myth that the insects can survive a nuclear blast, although all those exposed to the highest dose of radiation perished. It's thought the cockroach’s ability to survive is because of its simple body and cell cycles, which only renew once a week, leaving radiation few opportunities to attack, compared with humans whose cells are constantly splitting.","Shelby Counterman, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, has kept roaches for five years .

"Away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, it was back to work today for Stephen Hawking following Eddie Redmayne's Oscar for playing the celebrated physicist. The 72-year-old, who has motor neurone disease, was too ill to attend last night's dazzling ceremony, settling instead for a hearty message of congratulation on Facebook. These images of the world-renowned professor at Cambridge University are a timely reminder of the gulf between his life of study and the acting career of his 33-year-old counterpart. Back to work: Stephen Hawking was pictured arriving at Cambridge University today, just hours after Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for playing the scientist . Hawking seemed in good spirits as he was wheeled onto the Cambridge University campus accompanied by his nurse . The professor congratulated Redmayne on winning best actor at the Oscars for his performance in The Theory of Everything . The physicist, who has motor neurone disease, said he was 'proud' of Redmayne for winning the Oscar . Accompanied by two nurses who were seen waving and smiling. Mr Hawking spent the afternoon working at the campus, where many of the scenes for the film were shot. He was wrapped up warm in a blanket as he was wheeled from the car in his specialist wheelchair, which has a computer screen for him to communicate. Hawking is the director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge, and is one of the world's most respected scientists. The professor had earlier congratulated the actor on Facebook after he won the award for best actor following his performance in The Theory of Everything. He wrote on Facebook: 'Congratulations to Eddie Redmayne for winning an Oscar for playing me in The Theory of Everything Movie. Well done Eddie, I'm very proud of you.' Redmayne, who had already won a Bafta and Golden Globe for his performance as Hawking, spent seven months preparing to play the famous scientist. He met him briefly before filming began and dedicated his award to Hawking and his family last night. The actor said the award for was 'all of those people around the world battling' motor neurone disease and said that the Oscar belonged to 'Stephen' and his ex-wife Jane, as well as the rest of their 'exceptional family'. Hawking, who is director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge, spent the afternoon at work . Many of the scenes in The Theory of Everything were filmed at Hawking's workplace in Cambridge . Joy: Eddie Redmayne collects his best actor Oscar from Cate Blanchett last night . The Theory of Everything tells Hawking's story from his early years as a student at Cambridge University to his relationship with his future wife Jane. It also shows him dealing with the onset of motor neurone disease as he learns to use a wheelchair and speak through a computer. Redmayne won over even more fans last night with his excited and emotional response to his 'extraordinary' big win, breaking off midway through his acceptance speech to exclaim 'wow'. 'I don't think I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now. I'm fully aware that I'm a lucky, lucky man,' he said. Clutching his Oscar, Redmayne added: 'I will be its custodian and I promise you I will look after him, I will polish him, I will answer his beck and call and wait on him hand and foot.' Accepting his trophy from Cate Blanchett, a shocked Redmayne also told his new wife Hannah: 'I love you so much,' before joking about the trophy: 'We have a new fella coming to share our apartment'. Redmayne won over even more fans last night with his excited and emotional response to his 'extraordinary' big win . The Theory of Everything tells Hawking's story from his early years as a student at Cambridge University to the onset of motor neurone disease . Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones were joined by their real-life counterparts Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde at the premiere of  The Theory of Everything . Later, Redmayne said that being on stage was 'an extraordinary euphoria.... something I will not forget in a hurry'. Backstage, he told reporters that he had been trying to 'bury all this frenzy of nerves and white noise and trying to speak articulately and, of course, you then forget everything'. He admitted that despite now being an Oscar winner, it had not always been easy to find work. 'I've never really had much choice in work-wise, I've always had to fight for the jobs and fought pretty hard for them, certainly for The Theory Of Everything,' he said. 'So as far as where you go from here, just retaining employment will keep me very happy.' Redmayne, who has also won a Golden Globe, Bafta and Screen Actors Guild for the performance, thanked his 'staggering partner in crime Felicity Jones' who lost out on the leading actress Oscar to Julianne Moor, who starred in Still Alice.","Stephen Hawking pictured arriving for work the night after the Oscars .

"A man has been arrested after attempting to take the ultimate shell-fie by standing on top of a 120-year-old giant tortoise at an Indian zoo. Fazal Shaik, 24, has been arrested for wildlife offences in Hyderabad, a city in eastern India, after uploading the picture on to social media sites. He posed for the picture while standing on the Galapagos tortoise's shell after jumping into the giant reptile's enclosure while visiting the city zoo. Fazal Shaik has been arrested for wildlife offences in Hyderabad, in eastern India, after uploading this picture to social media sites which shows him standing on top of the giant tortoise's shell while visiting a zoo . The garage worker was arrested after he uploaded the snaps onto his Facebook page and shared them on Twitter. Fazal, who is facing six months in jail if convicted, told police: 'I just wanted to put it up on Facebook so I'd get lots of likes.' Nehru Zoological Park curator Ramakrishna Rao said: 'I am glad the police are making an example of him and I hope it will deter others. 'He did get a lot of attention, but I hope it is not the sort he wanted. The incident took place at Nehru Zoological Park (pictured) in Hyderabad, a city in eastern India . 'It is a privilege to be able to see these magnificent creatures close up. This sort of cruelty and stupidity cannot be tolerated.' Galapagos giant tortoises are the largest living species of tortoise on the planet and the 14th-heaviest living reptile. They are classed as a 'vulnerable' species which means they are likely to become endangered. They have life spans of well over 100 years - with one which was bred in captivity living to around 170 years. Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s.","Fazal Shaik, 24, posed for picture on top of 120-year-old tortoise's shell .

"Guilty: Cpl Wassef Hassoun was found guilty of desertion in a court-martial trial on Monday. He faces the possibility of more than seven years in military prison at sentencing later this week . A U.S. Marine who vanished a decade ago in Iraq was convicted Monday of desertion for leaving his post there and then fleeing to Lebanon after a brief return to the U.S. The judge at Camp Lejeune, Marine Maj. Nicholas Martz, ruled in a bench trial that Cpl. Wassef Hassoun was guilty of deserting for the 2004 and 2005 disappearances. Hassoun was also convicted of causing the loss of his service pistol. Sentencing is expected later this week after more witnesses are called. A spokesman for the U.S. Marines, Capt. Stewart Coles, said in a release that Hassoun faces a maximum penalty of seven and a half years in prison, reduction in rank and a dishonorable discharge. While the judge determined Hassoun intentionally fled during the two disappearances at the heart of the case, his ruling leaves the defendant facing a less severe punishment than he did at the trial's outset. Had he been convicted of all charges and specifications, he could have been sentenced to a maximum of 27 years in prison. Hassoun was found not guilty of a theft charge related to his pistol, and his conviction for losing the pistol represents a lesser offense included under the military's destruction of property charge. Hassoun was also found not guilty on one of three specifications related to the desertion charge. Prosecutors argued during trial that Hassoun made preparations to flee his base in Fallujah in 2004 and told others that he planned to leave. They displayed quotes during opening statements attributed to Hassoun: 'I'll leave and go to Lebanon. I'm not kidding.' Deserted: Cpl Hassoun pictured left as he's escorted into the courtroom at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina on February 9. Prosecutors argued that he left his troop when he became disillusioned with military life . They said he was unhappy with how U.S. servicemen treated Iraqis during interrogations and that he was upset that training and a second deployment to Iraq kept him from being with a woman with whom he'd entered an arranged marriage. Defense attorneys maintain that Hassoun was kidnapped by insurgents in 2004. They argued that the case against the Muslim serviceman began with a 'rush to judgment' by Navy investigators after suspicious comrades told investigators about comments Hassoun made about the conflict between his native Lebanon and Israel. Days after his 2004 disappearance in Iraq, Hassoun appeared blindfolded and with a sword held above his head in an image purportedly taken by insurgents. An extremist group claimed to be holding him captive. Startling: After his 2004 disappearance, Hassoun was presumed dead when insurgent video surfaced showing him blindfolded with a knife being held above his head . Family man: Hassoun was a naturalized citizen of the U.S., but was born in Lebanon. Pictured above with his mother in an undated photograph . But Hassoun soon turned up unharmed at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, saying he'd been kidnapped. Officials were suspicious, and he was returned to Camp Lejeune in 2004 while the military considered charging him. After his return, Hassoun was allowed to visit family in Utah but disappeared a second time in early 2005. Hassoun traveled to Lebanon but was detained by that country's authorities after Interpol issued a bulletin related to his deserter status, the defense said. The defense says court proceedings in Lebanon lasted until 2013, and Hassoun turned himself in to U.S. authorities after the government there lifted travel restrictions. The defense conceded Hassoun's travel to Lebanon in early 2005 constituted an unauthorized absence, and he has pleaded guilty to that lesser offense. Prosecutors, however, still pursued the more serious desertion charges.","Cpl Wassef Hassoun found guilty of leaving his unit twice in 2004 and 2005 .
