"The compassion shown by Officer William Stacy to desperate Alabama mother Helen Johnson captured the nation's attention at a time of strained relations between the police and black Americans. Instead of arresting her for stealing five eggs to feed her starving family on Saturday, Stacy bought the carton and the touching hug they shared afterwards caught on video by a stunned passer-by went viral. But it got even better on Wednesday when Officer Stacy and some colleagues arrived at 47-year-old Johnson's home with two truckloads of food to keep her and her children and grandchildren fed through Christmas. Scroll Down for Video . Christmas kindness: Officer William Stacy with Helen Johnson after donated food was delivered to her. Tarrant Police officers including Officer William Stacy deliver bags of food to Helen Johnson on Wednesday . Overwhelming: Helen Johnson gets emotional as she unpacks donated food in her kitchen.  Stacy bought the one dozen eggs that Johnson stole from a local store and didn't arrest her.  The act to kindness was recorded and Johnson says it changed her life . The hug that changed her life: Helen Johnson thanks Tarrant Police officer William Stacy with a hug in her kitchen after he had delivered two truckloads of food for her and her family . 'The last time I saw my house this full, I was 12-years-old and staying with my grandmother,'' said Johnson to Al.Com. 'I've been crying all day.' Officer Willaim Stacy hugs a still crying Helen Johnson as she watches another officer bring more donated food to her house. Johnson's granddaughter Tamarose Johnson, 3, smiles at the front door as she watches too . The reaction to the viral hug was so imense that Tarrant Police Chief Dennie Reno said that he had to bring in a second police dispatch officer just to field the calls of donations for Johnson coming in from the around the country. 'As of right now, with all the stuff going on in Ferguson and New York and all over the US, it's good to have this kind of story,' said Officer Stacy to AL.Com. 'It gives a positive image for law enforcement.' Officers also set up a fund at People's First Federal Credit Union in Tarrant with all the money pouring in destined to be handed to the Johnson family. 'It's growing and growing and growing,' said Reno to Al.Com. 'A guy called me from New York and just broke down. He said for two months he's been angry with police, and he said this has totally changed his mind.' But Reno said that the best outcome for everyone out of the heart-warming episode was that Johnson will not be forced to steal just to feed her family, especially during the Holidays. 'This woman's getting plenty of food,' said Reno to Al.com. 'She shouldn't be hungry for a while.' Every week Johnson feeds her two daughters, niece and two grandchildren, ages 1 and 3 with her welfare check of just $120 a month. However, last week the money was lost in the mail, leaving the Johnsons perilously close to starvation. By Saturday, the family had not eaten for two days, so Johnson went to Dollar General with only $1.25 to try and buy eggs. To her despair she found herself 50 cents short of the tax and put five eggs into her pockets. At the time it may not have seemed that way, but fortuitously the eggs broke in her pocket. 'I am not a good thief at all,' said Johnson to Al.Com. Stopped as she tried to leave with egg whites and yolks dripping from her jacket pocket, Johnson admitted immediately she had stolen them. The store had already called the police and when Officer Stacy arrived he told her to stay where she was while he spoke to the store owners. They decided together not to press charges against Johnson but when they went to speak to the grandmother she expected the handcuffs to come out. 'She started crying, she got very emotional and was very apologetic,' said Stacy said. 'She tried to give me the money she had on her, $1.25.' It was then that Stacy explained that she was not going to be arrested. He remembered her from a prior visit to her house and recalled how poverty stricken she was. Her family all sleep on mattresses on the floor. 'The story she told me Saturday matched up with what I had seen when I was there,' said Stacy according to Al.com. 'I felt like it was the right thing to do. I didn't want to pass judgment on her.' He bought her a carton of eggs and when Johnson asked Stacy how she could repay him, he simply asked her never to shoplift again. 'I hope she won't do it again. I pray she doesn't, and I don't think she will,' said Stacy. Just before she got into her car, Johnson turned to hug Stacy and unknown to them, the moment was captured on cellphone by Robert 'Dollar' Tripp who posted it to Facebook with the hashtag, 'feelgoodstoryoftheday'. Grand gesture: Alabama officer William Stacy bought a carton of eggs for a woman caught shoplifting on Sunday after the store she was at decided not to press charges . When it comes to cop of the year, William Stacy has a pretty decent shot.The officer from Tarrant, Alabama, was called to the local Dollar General store on Saturday for a shoplifting incident.However upon arriving, he quickly switched from policeman to nice guy. Touching: This is the moment Stacy handed the eggs to the woman and told her what he'd done . Scene: The touching incident occurred at the Dollar General in Tarrant, Alabama, on Sunday . The story was shared millions of times online and on Tuesday, officers from Tarrant police arrived at Johnson's house unannounced. 'I thought it was about the eggs. My grandbaby said, 'Are you going to jail?' and I said I hoped not.' She was not being arrested and instead was taken to Tarrant police station where they revealed she was to not only get food, but toys and clothing from well-wishers who had donated them for Johnson's family. And then on Wednesday, Officer Stacy and Officer Jay Jenkins brought the food to Johnson - causing her understandably to break down in tears. 'I just busted out and started hollering,' said Johnson to Al.com. 'I was yelling so loud. I would have been a good cheerleader.' Johnson then said her life has been changed forever because of Stacy and could never thank him enough.","Officer William Stacy and his colleagues delivered the food on Wednesday .

"Valencia, Inter Milan and Liverpool have inquired about signing  James Milner in the summer. Manchester City remain hopeful Milner will sign a new contract with the club - but fears are growing that the England man may soon be on the move. Following the 1-1 draw at Everton on January 10, manager Manuel Pellegrini said that he expected the versatile 29-year-old to pen a new deal 'within days'.

But that has not yet happened and while negotiations are ongoing Milner, whose contract expires at the end of the season, is understood to not be short of offers. It is understood that the former Leeds and Newcastle star is looking for assurances that he will get more playing time and is not convinced he can get those at the Etihad Stadium. This season he has started 11 Premier League games for City - one shy of last season's tally of 12. But injuries to key players have boosted Milner's opportunities and he was substituted at half-time in Sunday's 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal. The Gunners and Liverpool are known admirers amid reports that Milner has received a pre-contract offer from abroad. With English players at a premium at elite level, the prospect of picking up a domestic international on a free transfer is likely to appeal. The England international has made 11 league starts this season but is said to want more playing time . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (left) and Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers are interested in Milner .

"The Royal College of Nursing's Peter Carter said figures showing 5,778 nurses were recruited from abroad in the year up to September 2013 showed an 'astonishing over-reliance' on foreign staff . Almost 6,000 new NHS nurses were recruited from abroad last year, many from Spain and Portugal. The huge influx – a four-fold rise on the previous 12 months – has sparked fears that some nurses will lack the English language skills to do their jobs properly. Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the figures showed an ‘astonishing over-reliance’ on foreign staff. He added: ‘The last few years have seen real panic-buying of nurses from wherever they can be found, to keep care safe.’ Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ‘We are concerned that poor English skills may lead to mistakes and misunderstandings when patients are trying to explain their problems.’ An investigation by the Mail last month found that nurses picked up at recruitment fairs in Portugal struggled to fill out basic forms and needed a translation service. The latest figures, according to research by the Health Service Journal, show that in the 12 months to September 2013, 5,778 nurses were recruited from abroad compared with 1,360 the previous year. The staffing crisis has come about partly because the Government slashed the numbers of training posts. Demand also intensified following the damning report into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire, where many wards were dangerously understaffed. Hospital chiefs are flying to Spain and Portugal to find recruits because the recession there has led to high unemployment. A loophole in EU legislation prevents the Nursing and Midwifery Council from checking the English of European nurses before they are registered for NHS work. An investigation by the Mail last month found that nurses picked up at recruitment fairs in Portugal, such as this one for Bedford Hospital, struggled to fill out basic forms and needed a translation service . Joana Duarte, 22, Daniela Soares, 22, Mariana Santos, 22 and Diana Silva, 22 (pictured left to right) from Porta are all filling out application forms to work at Bedford hospital as there are no jobs for them in Portugal . Hospitals must carry out their own tests but there is a suspicion that some turn a blind eye to poor results. Mrs Murphy said: ‘We hear from patients on our helpline there are real issues with nurses from other countries, including problems with communication and a lack of understanding of processes and procedures. We must ensure they are fully qualified and competent to carry out their duties and that they are competent enough in English to effectively communicate with patients.’ Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘All these nurses may be excellent, but there are real concerns about the language barrier. It just shows how disorganised the NHS is – why aren’t we training more of our own?’ Demand for nurses intensified following the damning report into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire, where many wards were dangerously understaffed . The Health Service Journal figures show that 1,925 nurses came from Spain and 1,240 from Portugal. Kings College Hospital in London (pictured) recruited the most, 276 . The Mail investigation involved a recruitment fair held in a hotel in Porto and hosted by Bedford Hospital to hire 25 nurses. Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said millions was being wasted on overseas recruitment . Managers failed to carry out rigorous written tests on candidates’ English, and offered help with completing the application forms using an automatic translation website. Some candidates, who admitted their English was not very good, were told this would not matter because patients and hospital staff would speak slowly. Professor Jane Ball, a health affairs academic at Southampton University, said recruitment fairs were ‘a short-term and inefficient stop gap’. Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘The Government should be bringing on the next generation of nurses, but ministers are cutting training places at home and wasting millions on overseas recruitment.’ A Department of Health spokesman said an extra 1,000 adult nursing training places had been added this year, but acknowledged that foreign nurses had always been an important part of the NHS. He added: ‘Individual trusts are responsible for planning and recruiting their workforce.’ The Health Service Journal figures show that 1,925 nurses came from Spain and 1,240 from Portugal. Kings College Hospital in London recruited the most, 276. Overseas nurses now make up 13 per cent of the 686,240 who are registered to work in the UK. Dr Carter said: ‘Overseas nurses have always made a valuable contribution to the NHS, but these figures show an astonishing over-reliance.’ A spokesman for Bedford Hospital NHS Trust said: . ‘Like many trusts, difficulties in recruiting locally and nationally meant it undertook additional overseas recruitment. The interview panel in Portugal included senior nurses from the Trust and the process included written tests followed by rigorous interviews in English, testing listening skills and reasoning applied to nursing practice, including drug calculations. The applicants are also asked to write a care plan. Trust staff did not help applicants complete their forms and it is not willing to employ nurses who have a limited command of English. A number of nurses were not offered contracts for this reason.’","In the 12 months to September 2013, 5,778 nurses recruited from abroad .

In common with most other national newspapers, on December 17 and 18 we reported analysis by the Health Service Journal which stated that, due to an NHS nursing shortage, 5,788 out of 7,111 nurses recruited in the last 12 months were foreign. In fact, while the 5,788 figure was correct, the 7,111 figure related to the net change in the number of full-time equivalent nurses over a six-month period only. The Health Service Journal and the Health & Social Care Information Centre have asked us to make clear that the statistics were not therefore comparable. HSCIC's analysis shows that, in the 12 months to September 2014, 7,449 out of 33,838 joiners - including health visitors, midwives and nurses - were non-British."
"Steve Davies' second-half strike helped Blackpool to only their second Sky Bet Championship win of the season as Lee Clark's men beat his former side Birmingham 1-0 at Bloomfield Road. Davies scored the only goal in the second half to give bottom-of-the-table Blackpool all three points and lift them to within eight points of safety. The defeat is Birmingham's first in their last six games and their first since Gary Rowett took charge, while the Seasiders are now three games unbeaten. Steve Davies celebrates scoring the winning goal for Blackpool against Birmingham on Saturday . Davies salutes the crowd after scoring for Blackpool to give the Seasiders just their second win of the season . David Cotterill came close to giving Birmingham the lead after eight minutes but saw his low free-kick from 25 yards pushed away by Blackpool keeper Joe Lewis. The hosts thought they had gone in front after 13 minutes when Davies swept Chris Eagles' cross into the net from six yards, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. Stephen Gleeson called Lewis into action again in the 20th minute with a right-footed volley from 25 yards which was comfortably held by the Blackpool keeper. The home side threatened to go in front in the 24th minute as Eagles' free kick from the right edge of the area was met by Davies who saw his header from six yards deflected onto the roof of the net. Lee Clark masterminded victory against his former club at Bloomfield Road . The best opening of the first half fell to Birmingham after 33 minutes as they cut Blackpool open down the right and Lee Novak saw his effort from 12 yards cleared off the line by Kevin Foley. Rowett's side continued to push forward and just a minute later Gleeson's cross went over Lewis and was met by Michael Morrison, who could only head across the face from four yards with the goal gaping. Eagles had the first opening of the second half as he picked the ball up 25 yards out and unleashed a right-footed shot which was high and wide of Darren Randolph's goal. And Davies gave Blackpool the lead after 55 minutes as he latched on to a long ball forward from Lewis and rolled Paul Robinson to poke the ball past Randolph from 18 yards. Birmingham Jonathan Grounds (right) heads the ball towards goal but Nyron Nosworthy makes the block . Clark's side threatened again in the 63rd minute as Jacob Murphy broke down the right and powered his shot at goal from 18 yards but Randolph parried away. Murphy almost caught Randolph out from distance when he took a shot from 40 yards after 65 minutes and the Birmingham keeper had to back-pedal to push it over. The Blackpool winger troubled Randolph once more after 79 minutes as he cut in from the left and forced the keeper to hold low down to his right. Substitute Mark Duffy wasted a chance to equalise from a 25-yard free kick as Blackpool held on for the victory.","Blackpool manager Lee Clark got one over on his former employers .

"Workers at a Denver restaurant had no idea that a vagrant had been living in the rafters until on Tuesday night he fell through the ceiling, triggering a flood. Denver police received an unusual call from the Yard House eatery on Court Street at around 11pm reporting an intruder who had plummeted from the rafters. When officers arrived on the scene, they spotted the unwelcome guest, later identified as 36-year-old Steven Graves, walking around the scaffolding. Scroll down or video . Unwelcome patron: Denver police received an unusual call from the Yard House eatery in Denver reporting an intruder who had plummeted from the rafters . Hideaway: Police found multiple bottle caps from liquor bottles in the ceiling, suggesting that the man had been living there for some time . Waterworks: Intruder Steven Graves apparently caused a water pipe in the ceiling to rupture, flooding the restaurant and the adjoining lobby of the Sheraton Hotel . Strange sounds: Officers working on the scene heard moaning coming from near the restaurant's entrance . Trapped: Police pulled back a booth chair and saw Graves’ feet sticking out of the wall . Half naked: Graves, pictured on a stretcher after his extraction from the wall, was only wearing a pair of jeans . Graves then disappeared from view, and while officers could not see him he somehow ruptured a water main, flooding the Yard House and the lobby of the Sheraton hotel next door, according to The Denver Channel. Police climbed up to the ceiling, where they discovered evidence that the intruder had been living there for quite some time. James Ballinger, with the Denver Police Department, said that the space was strewn with bottle caps from liquor bottles. About three hours later, officers working on the scene heard moaning coming from near the restaurant's entrance. They pulled back some booth chairs and saw Graves’ feet sticking out of the wall. Firefighters had to use a chainsaw to cut him out. The ceiling dweller was only wearing a pair of jeans and was taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries after taking a 20-foot fall. The lobby of the Sheraton hotel next door was flooded as a result of the water main rupture . The Yard House was able to reopen for lunch the day after the dramatic incident . Graves was later booked into jail on burglary and criminal mischief charges. The burst pipe caused a lot of damage to both the hotel lobby and the eatery, but the Yard House reopened for lunch the following day.","Steven Graves, 36, charged with burglary and criminal mischief after falling from ceiling of Yard House eatery in downtown Denver Tuesday .

"A ‘ghost airport’ that opened almost four years ago, but which has yet to officially receive a single flight, is finally set to begin operations. The infamous Castellon-Costa Azahar airfield near Valencia was built at a cost of £130million and declared open in March 2011 despite having no airlines lined up to fly from there and no official government approval to operate. As a result, the airport has come to symbolise the reckless public spending across Spain that has left the country crippled with debt. The Castellon-Costa Azahar airfield near Valencia was opened in March 2011 but has not received any flights . A £200,000, 79-ft tall statue was also erected next to the terminal’s only runway, while last month it emerged that around £25million had been spent on publicity for Castellon airport despite the fact that it had failed to secure permits to receive air traffic. The State Agency for Air Security previously found that the strip was too narrow for aeroplanes to turn around, meaning it needed to be dug up and widened to meet regulations. The airport was developed by Carlos Fabra, the former president of Spain's ruling Popular Party in Castellón province who was jailed for tax-fraud on December 2. During the time it has lain deserted and unused, it was suggested that the facility should be turned into a car racing track or shopping complex. The airport was built at a cost of £130m and has come to symbolise the reckless public spending in Spain . But the airport is finally said to have now passed all the relevant tests and has the necessary certification for flights to begin. It was hoped that the new airport will open up a new area of Spain's eastern coast to tourism, although airlines have so far failed to be persuaded to add the destination to their routes. The region is currently served by busy international airports such as Valencia and Alicante to the south and Barcelona to the north. The facility will be run by Canadian multinational, Lavalin for the next 20 years in a £20million deal. A £200,000, 79-ft tall statue was also erected next to the terminal’s only runway . Those responsible for the facility predict regular flights will commence from March 2015 to coincide with the Easter tourist season. Lavalin predicts that during 2015 the airport will receive around 50,000 passengers and by 2017 that number will have risen to over 200,000. It has been confirmed that Villareal Football Club will be the first customers of the newly opened airport, flying from Castellón for their matches both within Spain and abroad. The team has previously used Valencia airport for their flights. Those responsible for the facility predict regular flights will commence from March 2015 to coincide with the Easter tourist season . Spanish newspaper ABC has reported that those in charge of the airport are hoping that low-cost airline Ryanair will also fly to and from Castellon. They are also hoping to establish direct links between the airport and London to attract more British visitors. José Ciscar, president of Aerocas, the public company that owns the airport recently said that they are ‘closer than ever’ to opening the airport and that he is already working with commercial flights that will use the airport in the spring-summer season. The local government will not start to make money on the airport until it exceeds 1.2 million passengers a year, something with will not happen until 2029, according to Lavalin forecasts.","Castellon-Costa Azahar airfield near Valencia was built at a cost of £130m .

"If your annual Christmas wrapping session leaves you covered in screwed up balls of sellotape and torn paper, help is at hand. A new video showcasing an incredibly fast and simple technique has gone viral - revealing how to wrap a present in just 12 seconds. Using two pieces of tape, the trick, according to the footage, by YouTube user Todd Tripp filmed at the Takashimaya Department Store in Tokyo, Japan, is to place your gift diagonally in the corner of a sheet of paper, rather than in the middle. Starting point: Place the gift on the corner of the sheet of wrapping paper . The video, which has been viewed more than three million times in just three days, then demonstrates, in a remarkably easy-looking series of moves, how to complete the process. Firstly, assuring that two corners of your gift touch the edges of the paper, fold those two corners up and stick down with a piece of tape. Then fold the paper around the item - so that you are left with two corners of the sheet exposed . Twist the side-corner into the remaining triangle . Then stick each one to the gift - all in less than 12 seconds! Then fold the main section of paper, above the gift, over the box and flip the present over. Lift the flap of paper now left at the opposite end of the gift, followed by the final flap. Tuck in the pointed end to ensure the wrapping looks neat and secure with tape. If done correctly, the gift should be seamlessly wrapped with no crumpled paper or unsightly lumps. However, it is not clear if this technique, with other shapes of present, and is almost certain to fail on unconventionally shaped objects, or in fact, anything lacking straight edges.","Footage posted online by Todd Tripp and has already had three million hits .

"They are moments that 'never existed' but the subjects are as real as it gets in the latest works from German photographer Wolfgang Hildebrand, who has merged cityscapes from around the world at different times of the day into single, deceptive images. Hildebrand, 45, visited cities including Paris, Los Angeles, New York, Bangkok and his home town Hamburg for the project which aims to show them in a different light. 'I am always fascinated by urban landscapes, the temper, the hustle of them, the energy, and of course the constant transformation that takes place,' Hildebrand says. In Paris, France, street lights reflect off the water while the traditional houses are in daylight in Wolfgang Hildebrand's unique images . Hildebrand, 45 of Hamburg, splices together pictures from both day and night in Mong Kok in Hong Kong . A composite image taken a various times of the day on the outskirts of Los Angeles, USA . 'Not only the obvious transformations, such as new buildings, but the change that occurs within minutes in an urban surrounding. 'I have compressed the complex perception of urban existence into one single image.' Wolfgang describes his composite images of the same frame at different times of the day, and even days apart, as a 'new moment'. 'This new moment never really existed, but it looks somehow familiar to the viewer,' he adds. 'Only at second glance do we realise that not all is as it seems, questioning our common photographic perception.' Each image takes 15 to 20 hours to complete, with Wolfgang spending about three hours researching the location that will best show-off his technique. Actual shooting time is about five hours across various periods of the day but he uses the photo editing software PanormaStitching and Photoshop. Wolfgang says: 'People's reactions range from ""I don't get it"" to ""brilliant"" and ""unbelievable"".

'The difficulties are more in calculating how the course of time affects the final image. 'For example, a scene that looks nice during daytime may get very boring at dawn, because of closed shop-windows. 'So, most of the locations must be examined and scouted way before the shooting itself takes place.' Hildebrand looks at a busy street and stalls from a humble but handy walkway that helps pedestrians over traffic in Ratchathewi .

"This weekend we saw three of the best penalty takers in the country in action. Yaya Toure and Rickie Lambert both scored at the Etihad and Steven Gerrard scored another two on Sunday to make it 10 in the league. Toure has now scored six times from the spot in 2013-14 while Lambert  continued his phenomenal record. Since arriving at Southampton he has scored 34 out of 34 penalties. That is some achievement. Composed: Always handy from 12 yards, Steven Gerrard now has 10 goals from the spot this term . Cool: Yaya Toure has six from the spot this season, and scored the opener against Southampton . I spoke to Toure last week and asked him about his own impressive record this season. He never used to be a set-piece specialist but now he is  scoring them for fun. He told me the most important thing for a penalty taker is to stay calm, and there are few calmer players from 12 yards than Yaya. Michael Ballack was also in the Sky studio with me on Saturday and when I asked if the Germans practice penalties, he laughed and said: ‘What for? For you English it is all in your heads.’ He is spot on. There is no way you can recreate the atmosphere and exhaustion of an international game after 120 minutes. Gerrard will be at the World Cup in great form from the spot and Lambert’s record might give him an edge for selection. Let’s hope they keep it up. Precision: Rickie Lambert has scored 34 of his 34 penalties taken for Southampton . All in your head: Former Germany captain Michael Ballack says there's no need to practise penalty taking . No luck: England have lost out in a penalty shoot-out in six of their last 10 major tournaments . Blues are flying . That was exactly the kind of Super Sunday Merseyside will have wanted. Roberto Martinez has Everton playing exceptional football and he really has taken them to another level. I said last week that Brendan Rodgers is my  manager of the year, but Martinez is not far behind. His team swept past Arsenal with such pace that they reminded me of the Arsenal teams of old. Arsene Wenger’s side have conceded 20 goals now away to the top four, which shows you where they are going wrong. Double trouble: Romelu Lukaku and Steve Naismith scored Everton's opening two goals against Arsenal . That's good son: Fired up boss Martinez and the Chelsea front man share the moment . Wanting: Arsenal players wait for play to restart after the second goal in the 3-0 domination by Everton . Super Skrtel . It was a good result for the red half of Merseyside, too. So much is said about Liverpool’s attacking players but I was really impressed by Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho against West Ham. Skrtel in particular has been excellent this season. There were doubts that he may not feature much but he has been essential to their success. He did a great job on Andy Carroll and he needs to do the same next week against Man City’s fearsome strike force. The back: Skrtel (second left) and Sakho (far left) put in an impressive performance against West Ham . Pleased as Puncheon . When Jason Puncheon missed a penalty against Tottenham in January, it was the kind of miss that would have affected a lot of players. But, as our table shows, his performances since then have been the perfect response. He scored twice on Saturday, including a magnificent curling effort. He’s been at many clubs throughout his career but he might just have found a home at Palace. I am all ears: Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon celebrates after scoring his second goal against Cardiff . I wondered if he would be a Tony Pulis type of player, but he has been crucial in the past few weeks. He has a great left foot and is showing what he can do. Palace were magnificent against Cardiff and in such a vital game, too. There was always a question over whether they could follow up the win over Chelsea but they put in a fine display and Puncheon was at the heart of it. High, wide, handsome: Puncheon has bounced back from his dismal penalty miss against Spurs in January . All change: Puncheon before and after penalty miss at Spurs in January . Norwich finally pull the trigger . It's a big call for Norwich to sack Chris Hughton, but chief executive David McNally has had his list of replacements ready for a while. The club’s Under 18s coach Neil Adams has been put in charge but he has been thrown a grenade. These are his first five matches: Fulham (A), Liverpool (H), Man United (A), Chelsea (A), Arsenal (H). The Fulham game will be vital. Four weeks ago Felix Magath’s side looked doomed but the weekend results have given them hope. The turmoil at Norwich could help them and their great escape might just be on. Heading down? Norwich are on the edge of the relegation zone and have decided to sack Hughton . Remainder: Youth coach Adams has taken charge, but Norwich have not said if he is a permanent replacement . A shame for Jay . Though Lambert might be on his way to Brazil it was sad to see his Southampton team-mate Jay Rodriguez pick up what looks like a serious injury. He has had a fantastic season and though there was no guarantee he’d get picked for the World Cup, he would have been unlucky to miss out. I missed a World Cup and European Championship through injury – it breaks your heart in two. He just has to remember the season he has had, take positives from that and get fit again. He is still young so I’m sure his chance will come. In tatters: Jay Rodriguez's suffered a serious-looking knee injury against Manchester City . Leicester back on the up . Congratulations to Leicester on their promotion. It’s been 10 years since they were in the top flight but Nigel Pearson has done a great job and they thoroughly deserve to be back there. I expect Burnley to follow them soon and then it will be a real battle for the final place in the play-offs. Victory selfie: The Leicester City players show their joy after learning that they had been promoted . 38 - Felix Magath has been keen to make the most of his squad since taking charge of Fulham. The German made three changes to the team that lost to Everton, including a second debut for Mahamadou Diarra in his second spell at the club. Diarra became the 38th player to be used by Fulham this season, a record for the Premier League. 49 - David Moyes (below) continued to tinker with his United team. He made eight changes for the Newcastle match and has now used a unique starting XI in 49 games. 6 - Aleksandar Kolarov set up another goal on Saturday. The Serb (right) has made six assists this season, more than any other defender in the league. 1973 - Fulham grabbed a vital three points at Aston Villa but they had not won a league match at Villa Park since March 1973. That year they won 3-2 in the old Division Two. 0.62 - Cardiff are in trouble. Under Malky Mackay they averaged 0.9 points per game but with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (below) they average just 0.62. 2 - Mohamed Salah now has two goals in two games at Stamford Bridge. He has scored as many goals for Chelsea at the ground as he has against them – he also scored two for Basle in the Champions League. 6 - Prior to defeat against West Brom, Norwich were unbeaten in six games at Carrow Road, winning three and drawing three. But West Brom’s fourth league win in five games at the ground has plunged Norwich right back into the relegation battle.","Yaya Toure and Michael Ballack agree the key to penalties is to stay calm .

"Imagine a world where milk is not only artificially produced, but also free of lactose and cholesterol. That’s the dream of three bio-engineers in the US who are preparing to produce a proof-of-concept of their cow-free milk. Ryan Pandya, Perumal Gandhi and Isha Datar are the founders of biotech start-up Muufri, and by next year they’re expecting to have made the first batch of their potentially revolutionary beverage. Ryan Pandya (left), Perumal Gandhi (right) and Isha Datar are the three members of the US-based company Muufri, which by next year is hoping to have produced the world's first batch of artificially produced milk. In three years the team hopes to bring the lactose-free product to market . The purpose of the company is not just to produce a beverage that can be enjoyed by 75 per cent of the world’s population, who are lactose-intolerant. In other milk news a glass of milk a day could help stop women's knees from creaking, claim researchers in a report for the journal Arthritis Care & Research . The US study found women who frequently drink fat-free or low-fat milk may have less osteoarthritis in the knee. But eating cheese increased the problem in women. Drinking milk made little difference in men, and eating yogurt did not affect progression in men or women. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and swelling of joints in the hand, hips, or knee. Lead author Dr Bing Lu, from Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, said: 'Milk consumption plays an important role in bone health. 'Our study is the largest study to investigate the impact of dairy intake in the progression of knee OA.' They also want to reduce our dependence on animals, and developing this product would be an important step in that regard. Muufri will be part of the Synthetic Biology Accelerator, sponsored by SOSVentures, and the team is making their product at University College Cork in Ireland. The team believes producing the key components of milk in yeast culture will make it possible to provide consumers and food manufacturers with the same products they know and love, but through a more sustainable, healthy and humane process. ‘It hasn’t been done yet because no one has made milk from scratch before,’ the team tells MailOnline. They explain how the idea for the project came about by the huge industrial farming operations in North America. ‘It’s upsetting to us because it results in a reduced quality of milk and causes so many issues in terms of environmental damage, greenhouse gases and water pollution. ‘These are big problems that start to happen when you crowd animals together. ‘We asked ourselves, what is the product? It’s not the cow, it’s the milk the cow produces.’ So the team went away and did some research on the composition of milk, and they were surprised to find that it was remarkably simple. The purpose of the company is not just to produce a beverage that can be enjoyed by 75 per cent of the world's population, who are lactose-intolerant. They also want to reduce our dependence on animals, and developing this product would be an important step in that regard . The team were surprised to find that it was remarkably simple to make milk. The main components that give it its flavour and function are six proteins and eight fats.  Lactose is also present but the team say it is superfluous; their cow-free milk will also be lactose-free . The main components that give it its flavour and function are six proteins and eight fats. Lactose is also present but the team say it is superfluous; their cow-free milk will also be lactose-free. And with 75 per cent of the world’s population lactose intolerant, particularly people in Asia, that will be music to the ears of many. They predict that in 100 years, artificial milk will be the norm for world’s then-expected population of nine billion people. The team is hoping to have a proof of concept by July 2015 - after that they will then look into ways to scale up production to bring it to market. ‘Three years from now we expect to be on shelves,’ they say. And ultimately they’re hoping to jump into production with first a do-it-yourself-kit, which will include the proteins and other ingredients needed to make artificial milk. ‘It’s a win-win situation,’ the team adds, ‘unless you’re a big dairy executive.’","Start-up company Muufri is planning to produce cow-free milk soon .

"Lionel Messi believes winning the World Cup with Argentina would be the greatest achievement of his glittering career. Argentina will make it through to their first World Cup final in 24 years if they beat Holland at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo on Wednesday. Messi's trophy cabinet is packed with awards. He has won six Spanish league titles with Barcelona, three Champions Leagues and he has been awarded the Ballon d'Or on four occasions. VIDEO Scroll down for All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . All smiles: Lionel Messi in Argentina training in Sao Paulo . Crunch clash: Argentina are set to take on Holland in the World Cup semi-final on Wednesday . Ball control: Messi with his national coach Alejandro Sabella . Compatriots: (L-R) Ezequiel Garay, Rodrigo Palacio, Lionel Messi and Lucas Biglia in training . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . But one accolade is missing - the World Cup. Four years ago, many of Messi's Barcelona team-mates returned to Catalonia with a World Cup winners' medals and now he wants one of his own. 'As a player winning a World Cup is the best there is,' the Argentina captain said in an adidas interview published on AS. 'It's something you dream about when you are a kid and it never disappears. 'I have asked my Barcelona team-mates Xavi, (Andres) Iniesta and (Gerard) Pique what it is like to lift the trophy, and they couldn't explain. 'We will do everything to make this dream a reality. 'To play a World Cup final with the great atmosphere of the Maracana is something what every player dreams of, but first we have to make sure we get there.' Danger man: Lionel Messi and Argentina remain on course for a place in the World Cup final . Going deep: Argentina reached their first World Cup semi-final since 1990 after beating Belgium 1-0 . Full flow: The magical attacker drives into the Belgium half late in the second half of Argentina's 1-0 win . Argentina will, of course, be banking on their talisman to deliver that bit of magic to beat Louis van Gaal's Holland, who have been one of the toughest teams to beat at the World Cup. Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella poetically summed up what Messi means to him after the narrow quarter-final win over Belgium. 'He was our water in the desert,' Sabella said, reflecting on a first half in which Messi shone while others around him struggled. Even though Sabella has the likes of Angel Di Maria, Javier Mascherano and the fit-again Sergio Aguero to call on, his reliance on Messi is clear. Close watch: Teams have tried to man-mark the Argentine but he has still won games single-handedly . Architect: Messi has scored four of Argentina's eight goals and provided a vital assist against Switzerland . VIDEO Team Profile: Argentina highlights . Messi, who has scored four of Argentina's eight goals, could still end the tournament as top scorer, but he is not concerned about individual accolades. This is a team game, he insists. 'I'd prefer the World Cup than the golden boot. Always,' he said. 'I am only concentrating on the team. If we concentrate on our own game and we prepare ourselves tactically then our football will do the talking. 'If I keep scoring goals and that helps the team then that is the most important thing.' If Messi was feeling any nerves on the eve of the semi-final in Sao Paulo then he was not showing it. 'I am feeling positive pressure,' Messi said. 'It's a great honour to be captain of Argentina. I want to pay back the trust given in me leading Argentina to the World Cup.' Wait: Argentina last lifted the World Cup in 1986 when Diego Maradona guided them to glory in Mexico . Laid back: The Barcelona forward is key to Argentina's chances of lifting the World Cup . Argentina and Holland share a rich World Cup history. The Dutch put on a fantastic display of 'total football' to beat Argentina 4-0 in 1974, but four years later the South Americans got their revenge, beating the Oranje to lift the trophy. Twenty years on Dennis Bergkamp scored a breath-taking winner in one of the most memorable matches of France '98. Burden: Argentina have looked to Messi for inspiration at every turn during the tournament so far . Moment of brilliance: Mascherano can remember watching Bergkamp's goal in the 1998 World Cup . Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano remembers the Bergkamp strike well. 'I was at home watching it on television and I was just as disappointed as everyone else,' Mascherano said. 'This Dutch team have got a lot of experience and they're hungry for success after losing the final in 2010, so we'll have to be on our guard. We're excited and we feel strong. We know we can put in another good performance.' Sabella has been boosted by the return of Aguero from a muscle injury for the semi-final. Di Maria may be out, but impressive full-back Marcos Rojo returns from suspension.","The Barcelona attacker has won the Ballon d'Or four times .

"She's preparing to move stateside to support her footballer beau so Christine Bleakley is looking forward to spending some quality time with her family this December. Christine, 35, has been living in Cheshire while fiance Frank Lampard is on loan to Manchester City, the sister team of New York City FC. However, due to his sporting commitments, the couple won't get to spend quality time together over Christmas. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Christine Bleakley shows off her svelte figure in her latest Soft & Gentle deodorant campaign . Speaking about her plans for the festive season, Christine said: 'It is always a family affair at Christmas. Frank is often away for most of it playing football and I often have my family over to London. 'Last year Frank was here for some of Christmas Day and we had his girls over too so there was quite a few of us celebrating. My mum normally does the cooking as I would say I am quite average but I would always help her out.' The TV presenter plans to join Frank in New York and return to the UK sporadically for work. Speaking candidly about his partner, Frank recently insisted that wouldn't want to remain apart for too long. And while 2015 will bring a new stomping ground for Christine, she doesn't believe in New Year's resolutions. She said: 'I have got to the point now when I feel there is no point starting a New Year’s Resolution as I often find it hard sticking to them but when I do, I normally just try to eat healthier and avoid having snacks around the house so much. Love: Christine has been living in Cheshire while fiance Frank Lampard is on loan to Manchester City, the sister team of New York City FC, and the pair are moving stateside in the New Year . 'Also make sure I get to the gym as often as I can, which I’m normally quite good at doing.' The results are clear to see. Christine shows off her enviable physique in her new campaign for Soft & Gentle deodorant. Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I love the change in season and love getting into the winter time. I have to buy a new coat and boots in the winter as a staple treat for myself.

Beauty buff: Christine shows off her enviable physique in her new campaign for Soft & Gentle deodorant . Trendsetter: Christine showcased her style on Dancing On Ice last year alongside Phillip Schofield . Speaking about how her look has developed over the years, she said: 'I would say I have become a lot more simple in terms of style and really like clean, fresh looks. 'I like tailored clothes especially the Victoria Beckham collection, which suit my shape and I’m not great with loose things.' Describing herself as a 'bag girl' rather that a shoe aficionado, Christine explains that her favourite tote is one that Frank brought her five years ago and was her first expensive bag. 'It was a lovely small, simple Chanel black bag which gets an outing at least once a week,' she added. Fashion heroines: Christine says her beauty icons are supermodels from the golden age such as Cindy Crawford, while she loves Victoria Beckham's clothes and New York socialite Olivia Palermo's style . While she labours over her fashion choices, glamorous Christine maintains that she can get ready in 15 minutes. She takes cues from the age of the supermodels and thinks that Cindy Crawford was 'one of the most beautiful women' in the world. 'I think she and Catherine Zeta Jones are both stunning, always look amazing and don’t ever seem to age.

'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,' a source told the New York Daily News. 'They ate through his rug to fit under his door.' After numerous failed extermination attempts, the city's health authority has now been notified. The setback means staff are unlikely to see the eponymous magazine editor in the building until well into the new year.

"An 11-year-old girl from Arkansas gave her family the scare of their lives last week when she ran away from home after stealing $10,000 and jumped into a cab hoping to travel to Florida to meet a boy. When Brent Waller discovered that his daughter Alexis was gone December 5, his first, terrifying thought was that she had been abducted. But the father soon learned that the 11-year-old was not the victim of a kidnapping, but rather the culprit. Scroll down for video . Runaway: Alexis Waller, 11, pictured left and right, gave her father the scare of his life December 5 when she ran away from their Bryant, Arkansas, home and headed to Florida alone to meet a boy . Contrite: Sitting on the couch next to her dad, Brent Waller, a crestfallen Alexis said she was glad her parents tracked her down and brought her home . On the move: Alexis started her journey in her hometown of Bryan, Arkansas, planning to travel more than 850-mile down to Jacksonville, Florida, but was detaind in Atlanta, Georiga, about 350 miles shy of her goal . The 11-year-old girl had swiped $10,000 in cash from her grandmother's sock drawer, crept out of the family’s Bryant, Arkansas, home in the middle of the night and hitched a ride with a stranger to a gas station in Little Rock. Alexis then called a cab and asked the driver to drive her to Jacksonville, Florida, located about 830 miles away. The girl said the taxi driver did not ask her any questions beyond her final destination and whether or not she had the $1,300 fare. Alexis said she decided to make the long journey halfway across the country because she wanted to see a 16-year-old boy she had met on vacation two years prior and had been talking to ever since. The Florida teen later said he knew nothing about Alexis’ escape plan. When Alexis' parents discovered that she was gone and called police to report her missing, investigators jumped into action trying to find her. Road trip: The pre-teen swiped $10,000 from her grandmother's sock drawer, hitchhiked to a gas station in Little Rock where she hailed a cab, paying the driver $1,300 to take her to faraway Jacksonville, Florida . Reunited: Police were able to track Alexis down to a suburb outside Atlanta, Georgia, where her father, Brent Waller (pictured), picked her up after driving for nine hours through the night . Police obtained phone records and were able to trace Alexis' call to the Little Rock cab company, where officials said the girl wore heavy makeup and appeared to be 17 or 18, according to Arkansas Democrat Gazette. Before long, they reached the taxi driver the girl had hired, who told them they were driving in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. The 11-year-old's parents immediately hit the road, driving nine hours to pick her up. In retrospect, Alexis Waller said she was glad her parents were able to track her down and bring her home safe. ‘I knew I made a mistake after a while and I didn't have a phone,’ Alexis told KARK-TV. Brent Waller said when he reunited with his daughter in Georgia, he was furious at her but also relieved that she was unharmed. Crime and punishment: Mr Waller took away Alexis' makeup after learning that the young girl used it on the night of her escape to make herself look older . The taxi driver who agreed to take the pre-teen to Florida will not face any disciplinary actions, according to his employers. The Waller family now plan to push for legislation that would require cabbies to ask their passengers, especially minors, for identification. As for Alexis, Waller said he has confiscated her cell phone and makeup. Her grandmother isn't pressing charges over the stolen cash.","Alex Waller ran away from her Bryant, Arkansas, home and hitchhiked to Little Rock on December 5 .

The rolling sandy hills were once home to early settlers in the Late Stone Age, making Liwa one of the historic sites in the United Arab Emirates, according to a blog post by Deanna Yick, a Street View Program Manager. Some of the richest history in this desert lies in the Liwa Oasis - the largest oasis in the Arabian Peninsula. Many people from across the United Arab Emirates can trace their origins back to the first tribes who settled there and first established the area as a centre for trade. Dates are grown in the oases, and their fruit is important to local cultures. Google gathered views of oasis plants and vast expanses of sand with beautiful patterns etched by the wind, by attaching one of its Trekkers to a camel, which gathered imagery as it walked. The tech giant said that the use of camels allowed it to collect authentic images as well as minimally impact the environment.

"Sixty-six million years ago, a 5-mile (8km) wide asteroid crashed into the Earth at 70,000 miles per hour (112,600 km/h), vapourising upon impact. Scientists have long believed that heavy dust from the impact blocked out the sun, setting off a disastrous chain of events that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. But now researchers in the US have found more evidence for the theory that major volcanic eruption began just before the impact, possibly also playing a role in the extinction. Researchers in the US have found more evidence for the theory that major volcanic eruption began just before the impact, possibly also playing a role in the extinction . The team precisely dated rocks from the Deccan Traps - a region of west-central India that preserves remnants of one of the largest volcanic eruptions on Earth. They looked for rock that might contain zircon - a uranium-containing mineral that forms in magma after an eruption, and that can be used as a very precise dating tool. The researchers collected more than 50 samples of rocks from the region representing the largest pulse of volcanism. Samples from both the bottom and top of this volcanic layer contained zircon, allowing the team to pinpoint the timing of the beginning and end of the Deccan Traps eruptions. The team precisely dated rocks from the Deccan Traps - a region of west-central India that preserves remnants of one of the largest volcanic eruptions on Earth . Based on their analysis, the researchers determined that the eruption began 250,000 years before the asteroid strike and continued for 500,000 years after the giant impact. Scientists at MIT and Princeton University calculated that the volcano spewed out a total of 932,000 square miles (2.4 million square km) of lava. For two weeks, the researchers looked for volcanic rocks that might contain zircon - a uranium-containing mineral that forms in magma shortly after an eruption. It can be used as a very precise clock for determining the age of rocks; the mineral typically crystallises in magma containing high amounts of silica and zirconium. The researchers collected more than 50 samples of rocks from the region representing the largest pulse of volcanism. Fortunately, samples from both the bottom and top of this volcanic layer contained zircon, allowing the team to pinpoint the timing of the beginning and end of the Deccan Traps eruptions. The rocks were analysed separately at Princeton and MIT to make sure the dates determined in one lab could be replicated in another lab. In both laboratories, the scientists pulverised rocks and separated out millimeter-length grains of zircon. To determine the age of zircon, and the rock from which it came, the teams measured the ratio of uranium to lead isotopes. The group’s analysis indicates that the region of the Deccan Traps started erupting 250,000 years before the asteroid strike, continuing for another 500,000 years after the impact. The immense volcanism may have released dangerous levels of volatile chemicals into the air, poisoning the atmosphere and oceans, they say. 'If models of volatile release are correct, we're talking about something similar to what's happening today: lots of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere very rapidly,' said Michael Eddy, a graduate student at MIT. 'Ultimately what that can do is lead to ocean acidification, killing a significant portion of plankton — the base of the food chain. If you wipe them out, then you'd have catastrophic effects.' It's long been known that a major eruption occurred in India around the time of the end-Cretaceous extinction, but this event had never been precisely dated. Based on the new, more precise dates for the Deccan Traps, the researchers believe the massive eruptions may have played a significant role in extinguishing the dinosaurs. 'I don't think the debate will ever go away,' said Sam Bowring, a Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. 'The [asteroid] impact may have caused the extinction. But perhaps its effect was enhanced because things were softened up a bit by the eruption of these volcanoes.' Before 1980, the exact cause of dinosaurs' demise was unknown; one hypothesis proposed that they were killed off by massive volcanic eruptions. But the 1980 discovery in Italy of iridium, a rare element primarily found in extra-terrestrial materials, suggested otherwise. 'The story that is emerging is that perhaps both might have been involved,' Professor Bowring says. 'Perhaps the end of the dinosaurs was caused by a one-two punch.' The Deccan Traps are a large igneous province located on the Deccan Plateau of west-central India and one of the largest volcanic features on Earth .","US scientists dated rocks from the Deccan Traps in west-central India .

"Tori Spelling is gearing up for a kinky Christmas. The 41-year-old reality star is more determined than ever to save her seven year marriage to cheating hubby Dean McDermott, even if it means kicking their boring sex life up a naughty notch. According to a family insider, Tori and Dean, 47,  have been baring it all in therapy lately – with Dean confessing that he needs his wife to be a lot sexier if she wants to make him happy. ‘Dean insists he would never have cheated on Tori had it not been for her dropping the ball when it came to sex,’ says the friend. Scroll down for video . Rekindling the romance: Tori plans to keep the home fires burning for Dean this Christmas with new lingerie and steamy movies . Secret Santa: Tori spent $2,000 on new undies from Victoria's Secret. She won't be putting them under the tree . ‘When they first met, Dean says Tori was a sexy seductress who swept him off his feet with her beguiling ways, and he loved the fact that she was super adventuresome in the bedroom. ‘Strawberries and whipped cream wasn’t just for desert back then,’ adds the friend. ‘But once they celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary, Dean felt his wife was more interested in being a mom and homemaker than she was in trying to keep him happy and he longed for the all-night kinky sexathons he and Tori once shared. ‘Gone were the days of giving each other late night sensuous massages and sneaking quickies while the kids napped. And gone were the personal, sexy lap dances Dean used to get from his wife. 'All of a sudden she was more interested in being a successful actress and doting mom, while he felt ignored.’ The source says that when Tori and Dean had a chance to get away to New York recently and spend a little alone time together, she agreed to pull out all the stops to bring the passion back into their relationship. And no sooner did she get home, than she was ordering some sexy new lingerie, and figuring out ways to spice up their sex life. Family time: Tori and Dean and son Finn attend the Disney On Ice Presents Let's Celebrate! event yesterday in Los Angeles . ‘Tori went on line and ordered $2,000 worth of sexy lingerie from Victoria’s Secret,’ says the source. ‘And for the first time in their marriage she also ordered a few kinky sex toys and some steamy adult films. ‘Dean had been after her for a long time to put a lock on their bedroom door, but she was afraid the kids would awake in the middle of the night and need her and be locked out. But in an effort to provide the privacy she and Dean need, she called in a locksmith. ‘Tori also went shopping for candles and she began researching classes that teach women how to strip and pole dance. And she can’t wait to become Dean’s very own private dancer. ‘Tori also agreed that she and Dean would set aside at least one night a month to check into a hotel on their own and she agreed to try some sexy role playing when it comes to spicing up their sex life. ‘Dean was really turned on by Tori’s erotic ideas and he sees it as a real sign that she is not only willing to give him another chance, she’s also willing to become the sexy vixen he first fell in love with. ‘Dean and Tori both acknowledge that a lot of marriages go through the “seven year itch,”’ adds the friend. ‘And while many women aren’t willing to go that extra mile to sex things up with their husbands who’ve cheated, Tori still loves Dean and she’s is pulling out all the stops to make love work.’","Tori Spelling is kicking the passion up a naughty notch to spice things up for the holidays .

"Liverpool debutant Mario Balotelli generated all the pre-match hype, but it was Raheem Sterling who provided the magic in Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham. After the game Brendan Rodges paid tribute to Sterling's match-winning performance, and revealed that his expensive signing Balotelli had never before been asked to mark a player at a corner. Sterling ignited the 3-0 rout at White Hart Lane with an eighth-minute opener and tormented Spurs with a display that will have delighted England coach Roy Hodgson ahead of the forthcoming fixtures against Norway and Switzerland. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Brendan Rodgers . Strong start: Sterling nets Liverpool's early goal as they dominated the game at White Hart Lane . Big future: Brendan Rodgers says that the English midfielder can be a big part of Roy Hodgson's plans . The 19-year-old's finest moment saw him weave a path through the home defence only to fire a tame shot at Hugo Lloris, prompting Brendan Rodgers to joke: 'Raheem ran into the box like Ricky Villa and finished it like Ricky Gervais'. Otherwise the Liverpool boss was glowing in his praise for Sterling and with Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge also excelling, he predicted England will also benefit from the progress made by the trio. 'Raheem needs to be better on his left foot. It was a wonderful moment of skill and he was fantastic for us again,' Rodgers said. 'His tactical awareness is improving, and for a kid of 19.....he's been great. 'I don't see him as a (number) 10, I think he's flexible. You've seen his flexibility and it was perfect against Spurs. 'It's important he has the intelligence to play these different positions and he's developing that well. England's new spine? Sterling, Sturridge and Henderson are all in Hodgson's latest England squad . Decent debut: Rodgers said that Mario Balotelli's first game for Liverpool had been 'excellent' 'Him, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson are playing at a leading club and showing really good tactical awareness and energy. 'They're going to do well for Roy Hodgson in the years to come.' Balotelli, making his first appearance since completing a £16milllion move from AC Milan last week, could not be faulted for his attitude in an encouraging afternoon's work, but he missed three super chances. 'Mario was excellent. You could see his team ethic - he was pressing, working for us as much as he could. He was very good,' Rodgers said. 'Take away the circus that surrounds him - the circus he probably invites himself sometimes - and control the background noise and get him focused on his football, and he's a good fella. Chances: Balotelli misses several golden opportunities to mark his debut with a goal . Responsibility: Rodgers revealed that Balotelli was asked to mark at corners for the first time in his career . 'He'll make mistakes and he was disappointed not to score, but he'll be a handful for defenders. 'He's now at an age where he has to show maturity. Now I'm giving him responsibility. 'For the first time in his life, he marked at a corner. Seriously. 'An international player who has won three titles in Italy and the Champions League and we were doing corners in training. I said 'you're picking him up at a corner' and he said 'I don't mark at corners'. I replied: 'Well, now you do'. 'He had a great header against Tottenham from a corner. Treat him like an adult and it'll bring the best out of him.' Rodgers described the victory as an 'outstanding performance' following Monday's 3-1 drubbing by Manchester City and hailed Alberto Moreno's goal as 'a great finish'. It was Tottenham's first defeat of the season under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and the Argentinean felt events conspired against them. 'We are very disappointed with the result because we had key moments in the game,' Pochettino said. Decisive: Pochettino said that Spurs were unlucky at key moments, such as Steven Gerrard's 'soft' penalty . 'In the beginning after some mistakes we conceded the first goal, but we competed very well in that first half. We created a chance, a one against one with the keeper. 'Then in the second half we conceded a very soft penalty at a key moment in the game. 'And at 2-0 down we tried, but we tried but were unlucky. I'm disappointed with the result.' Raheem Sterling waltzed past four Tottenham players and then scuffed his shot to keeper Hugo Lloris, leaving the Liverpool star on the receiving end of that classic quote above from his own manager. Brendan Rodgers saw the funny side and added: ‘He has wonderful skill but he was caught in two minds.’ Below is the sequence that saw the youngster open the scoring.","Raheem Sterling scored early goal as Liverpool beat Tottenham 3-0 .

"A missile designed to destroy nuclear missiles after they have been fired failed to hit its target during a test launch. The ground-based interceptor missile fired from Vanderberg Air Force Base was supposed to hit a missile launched in the Kwajalein Atoll 4,000 miles away. It was the third consecutive failure of the Interceptor system, which is managed by Boeing Co, according to defense officials. Failed: A test of the interceptor from Vanderberg failed to hit its target 4,000 miles away . In theory, the missile defense system is supposed to use on board sensors to track incoming missiles, and then guide itself directly into the weapon's path. Radars that track its progress, would continue to take in data to confirm that the hit had been successful. The $214 million test launch of the only defense the U.S. has against long-range missiles took place over the Pacific, according to RT. Defense officials will now examine what prevented the interceptor from tracking and stopping its target. Defense: A ballistic missile test in May from Vanderberg, which is one of two bases that house the interceptors . 'Program officials will conduct an . extensive review to determine the cause or causes of any anomalies which . may have prevented a successful intercept,' a spokesman for the Pentagon told Fox News. About 30 interceptors are based in Vanderberg, southern California, and Alaska as part of the country's missile defense program that started in 2004. The Pentagon plans to spend another $1 billion on 14 more interceptors in Alaska, which is currently home to 26, after concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The military has tested the so-called ground-based mid-course defense system 16 times. It has succeeded eight times, with the last intercept in December 2008. Protests: South Koreans demonstrate in April after North Korean threats to launch a missile . Friday's test was the second to be held at the Californian base this year, and the first launch practice since a failed test in December 2010.

"From being dissolved and turned to ‘goo,’ to bodies laid to rest in replica Stone Age tombs, there seem to be more funeral choices on offer than ever before. Now, a company is offering a funeral service where the ashes of a loved one can be scattered at the edge of space from an origami casket. A camera films the moment the ashes are released above the Earth, and the curvature of our planet can be seen in the shots. Precious payload: A company is offering a funeral service where the ashes of a loved one can be scattered in space (pictured) and the moment filmed by cameras, enabling relatives to watch . A company called Mesoloft, which is based in Lexington, Kentucky, uses weather balloons to transport ashes, which are carried in a concertinaed container, to the edge of space. GoPro cameras capture the scattering of the ashes some 75,000ft (22,860 metres) above Earth, so relatives and friends can watch. ‘When the balloon reaches proper altitude, the bottom door on the custom payload urn opens,’ the company explained. Up, up and away: A weather balloon (pictured) is used to transport ashes, which are carried in a concertinaed container (also shown), to the edge of space . A graceful send off: The ashes float gradually to the edge of space where the concertinaed casket (pictured) opens and the ashes are drawn out by the Earth's gravity and the vacuum of space. A shot taken soon after launch is shown . Lack of burial space means sarcophagi are making a come-back because they can be stored above ground. A farmer has built a replica Neolithic long barrow in Wiltshire  and a space costs £400. Ashes can be transformed into a diamond for around £5,000. 'Alkaline hydrolysis' means bodies can be turned into goo after being submerged in water and potassium hydroxide, pressurised and heated. A cremation company in Vermont offers mourners the opportunity to have their loved one's ashes kept in a 3D-printed urn that bears an uncanny resemblance to them in life. A wig can even be added and the service costs from 2,600 (£1,657). ‘This is when the vacuum of space, along with gravity itself, draws the ashes out from the insert container. ‘Scientists don't really know how long the ashes will remain aloft so we look to volcanoes as a model. ‘While volcanic ash does not go nearly as high as our balloons, we do know it can take many months for the ashes to settle back to earth.’ ‘Ashes from volcanoes can travel the planet before settling down.’ The ashes can remain high up in the atmosphere for a couple of months, before gradually falling back to Earth, as part of rain or snowfall. There are launch sites in Indiana, Colorado and New Mexico and packages start at $2,800 (£1,800). They go up to $7,500 (£4,800), with the latter offering the option to launch from anywhere. Final journey: GoPro cameras capture the scattering of the ashes some 75,000ft above Earth (pictured), so relatives and friends can watch. It can take months for the ashes to fall back to Earth . A technical exercise: There are launch sites in Indiana, Colorado and New Mexico and packages start at $2,800 (£1,800). Here, an expert at the company tracks a balloon's progress on his computer . The world’s ‘most unique pet memorial service in the universe’ lets owners launch their pets’ ashes into orbit and even deep space aboard spacecraft. The new service has four service options, which start at $995 (£590). Since 1995 Houston-based Celestis has conducted memorial spacecraft carrying human remains to the moon and letting them drift through space, but the pet service is a new addition, which the firm says has been requested by owners of beloved animals. The world’s ‘most unique pet memorial service in the universe’ (pictured) lets owners launch their pets’ ashes into orbit and even deep space aboard spacecraft . Owners can choose from four spaceflight options, the cheapest of which is the Earth Rise service, at $995. This option will see a ‘symbolic portion’ of cremated remains go to space and after ‘experiencing the zero gravity environment,’ return to Earth. The capsule will even be returned to the pet’s family. While it may be easy to imagine an urn zooming through space, the ‘portion’ refers to approximately one gram of ashes or a lock of the pet’s hair. The pricier Earth Orbit Service costs from $4,995 (£2,961) and launches pets’ remains into space aboard a ‘real space mission alongside a commercial satellite. It will be placed in Earth orbit where it will stay before re-entering the atmosphere, vapourising like a shooting star ‘as a final tribute’. A Luna service, starting at $12,500 (£7,410) could leave the ashes of a pet on the moon, while the Voyager Service at the same price, could see a pet journey through the stars into deep space ‘to explore places they could only have dreamed of in life’.","Company based in Kentucky, uses weather balloons to transport ashes .

The trio have played 1,920 minutes (32 hours) of World Cup football between them but have collectively found the net just three times during that time. Diop, in comparison, played in just one World Cup - but what a World Cup it was. A colossus in midfield for Senegal on their debut on the world stage in 2002, he was responsible for one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history when he scored the only goal in a 1-0 win over the then-holders France in the opening game. Two goals in their third group game, a thrilling 3-3 draw with Uruguay, took his tally for the tournament to three but his hopes of adding to that were thwarted by Senegal failing to qualify for 2006 and 2010. Will this time be different? Wayne Rooney hasn't performed for England at a major tournament since 2004 . Have that! Ex-Derby County striker Paulo Wanchope scored for Costa Rica against Brazil in 2002 . Sneaking in: South Korea's Park Ji-Sung nets beyond Portugal's Vitor Baia during the home 2002 finals . Then there’s Park Ji-Sung. A former team-mate of Rooney’s at Old Trafford, the South Korean was one of the poster boys of the 2002 World Cup in the Far East and he did not disappoint. He scored once during Guus Hiddink’s sides run to the semi-final, where they were eventually beaten by Germany. He added further strikes at the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. England’s Group D oppponents Costa Rica would love to still have Wanchope in their side. The Derby County legend was a mainstay for the national side between 1996 and 2008, appearing at two World Cups during that time. He scored against the big names too, in a 5-2 defeat against the eventual champions in 2002, Brazil, and then twice against Germany in the group stages four years later. Messi, Ronaldo and Rooney have laboured their way through the last two tournaments but with all three firing on all cylinders in qualifying, scoring 10, eight and seven respectively, perhaps that disappointing form in World Cups is about to change. Other surprise names that have outfired Messi, Ronaldo and Rooney on the biggest stage: . Jon Dahl Tomasson - Denmark (5) Asamoah Gyan – Ghana (4) Pauleta – Portugal (4) Brian McBride – United States (3) Agustin Delgado - Ecuador (3) Tim Cahill – Australia (3) Robbie Keane – Republic of Ireland (3) Struggling: Real Madrid's Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo isn't fully fit for Portugal ahead of this month .","Ex-Costa Rica striker Paulo Wanchope has also found the net more often .

"For two clubs whose rivalry was enhanced by a ship canal, rarely have Manchester United and Liverpool entered a derby contest with defences equally distant from what you might call watertight. Pub standard, was Gary Neville’s acerbic take – the Dog and Duck against the Red Lion. Ouch. Louis Van Gaal bristled. Brendan Rodgers should do likewise. But the undeniable fact is that those selected to guard goals at either end on Sunday will not measure up to figures who have come before. Manchester United have struggled at the back this season with Louis van Gaal yet to find a settled pairing . Liverpool long for a defender of Alan Hansen's (centre) stature given their struggles this season . Ron Yeats (left) helped Liverpool win two First Division titles and an FA Cup . Sami Hyypia was another towering force in the Liverpool defence which is now full of holes . Rio Ferdinand was the most expensive British player when he joined United in 2002 for £30m . Neither team possesses a centre-back with the leadership of Steve Bruce or Ron Yeats, the collectedness of Rio Ferdinand or Alan Hansen, the physicality of Nemanja Vidic or Tommy Smith. That is not to say these current defences are write-offs. Certain players have shown glimpses to impress. But right now, the shadow of predecessors is cast large. Let’s take Bruce. He exuded calm and instilled belief across the back, captaining a United team of formidable characters as the Premier League came to rest at Old Trafford. There was also that famous late brace against Sheffield Wednesday, showing as much about his guts as aerial prowess. Then aged 35, Bruce helped nurture the likes of Neville during his second double season. In similar mode – Yeats led Liverpool on their ascendancy in the early 60s. Bought by Bill Shankly and given the armband, he was a substantial presence. ‘The man is a mountain, go into the dressing room and walk around him,’ Shankly told journalists on his signing. Yeats got Liverpool promoted from the Second Division and then won two First Division titles and an FA Cup. Jamie Carragher has been a big loss to Liverpool since hanging up his boots last year . Liverpool defender Emlyn Hughes throws himself into a tackle against Arsenal's Ray Kennedy . United have missed the presence of Nemanja Vidic since he left for Inter Milan over the summer . Lacking for each of United and Liverpool, is a player at the heart of defence who can be turned to for inspiration when the turf begins to shake. Neither is there a defender who can be trusted to always remain cool under pressure. Ferdinand had that skill, a composure to perform that sharp turn to find space when confronted with an onrushing attacker, rather than kick the ball into touch. He left United with a Champions League and six Premier League titles in his baggage. Hansen won three European Cups and eight First Division crowns and was imperative to Liverpool’s sustained period of dominance. Eschewing the option to boot the ball forwards, he would be more inclined to dribble out from the back, hence his years on Match of the Day bemoaning diabolical defending. Defences work on unity, of course. Bruce formed a redoubtable understanding with Gary Pallister that enhanced both of their games, Ferdinand’s silk was allied by Vidic’s steel. Hansen had Phil Thompson, then Mark Lawrenson as sidekick – finding hand and glove twice is fortunate but more testament to the players’ talents. Under Van Gaal, obtaining a settled defence is more likely than locating the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow – and that uncertainty is debilitating. Paul McGrath made close to 200 appearances for United, winning the FA Cup in 1985 . Gary Pallister (right) and Steve Bruce formed a brilliant partnership at the heart of the United defence . Louis van Gaal could do with a player like countryman Jaap Stam who was a mainstay in the United defence . Bill Foulkes (right) sits fourth on the Manchester United all-time appearances list . Paddy McNair has shown promise but was hooked before half-time at Southampton having endured a torrid match. Tyler Blackett needs time to develop. Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Phil Jones are injured too frequently to build up a head of steam – and Marcos Rojo simply does not look a centre-back. Rodgers would have hoped Dejan Lovren would form a solid union with Martin Skrtel, but each have gone backwards from last season. Kolo Toure has got some games but is prone to mistakes, and we are still waiting to see why Mamadou Sakho cost £18million. How Van Gaal would long for countryman Jaap Stam in his pomp – a courageous carrier of the ball and man of granite stature. How Rodgers would call up in a flash a prime-age Jamie Carragher – a defender of nous and bravery. Then there is Paul McGrath and Bill Foulkes, Emlyn Hughes and Sami Hyypia; great defenders each. It is a pity we cannot yet say the same about those taking the pitch this weekend. High standards. But that is the measure at these clubs.

"A woman of simple tastes: Queen Elizabeth II pictured in 1977 . Special K, jam sandwiches and chocolate cake are some of the Queen's favourite foods, according to her former personal chef. Darren McGrady, who worked at the Buckingham Palace kitchens for fifteen years, has revealed that away from the spotlight the 86-year-old British Monarch is a woman of simple tastes. While she feasts on elaborate dishes at state banquets, when at home she enjoys uncomplicated cuisine. McGrady said that she traditionally starts the day with a light breakfast followed by lunch, afternoon tea and dinner, topped off with a generous gin and Dubonnet before bedtime. The 49-year-old chef, who also cooked for Princess Diana and Princes’ William and Harry, said that Cornflakes or . Special K were popular requests at the breakfast table, with a helping of dried fruit or macadamia . nuts. While Darjeeling tea was the drink of choice. A typical lunch, served at 1pm, would be fish, such as a grilled Dover sole, placed on a bed of wilted spinach. 'She loved grilled Dover sole. Really simple, light and no sauce. Clean and simple that was how she liked it,' he told MailOnline. Then there would be afternoon tea of cakes, scones and sandwiches using de-crusted bread. Honey sponge, ginger cake and the chocolate . biscuit recipe that Prince William chose to be served at his wedding . reception were the top sweet treats and McGrady would also rustle up his special Chocolate Perfection Pie. Simple, but given the Royal seal of approval: Jam sandwiches and Special K are two of the Queen's top treats . Chefs prepare a state banquet at Windsor, but Her Majesty doesn't always go for the finest foods . 'The Queen loves chocolate, and the . Chocolate Perfection Pie was one of her favourites. It has three layers . and I think the word perfection sums up her 60-year reign.' But when she ate alone the Queen would prefer fruit over pudding. 'Chocolate is one of her favourites but when she dined alone she would just have a dish of fruit, an apple or a peach.' BREAKFAST: Cereal, dried fruit, macadamia nuts . LUNCH: Grilled Dover sole, wilted spinach, courgette . AFTERNOON TEA: Selection of cakes, scones and sandwiches . DINNER: Venison from Balmoral, white peaches from Windsor Castle, gin and Dubonnet . At least two varieties of sandwich . were offered, such as cucumber or egg mayonnaise, with the crusts cut off. ‘Even if she’s on her own, there’s sandwiches with the crusts off, white and brown; plain scones one day, fruit the next; a whole ginger or chocolate cake or a honey and cream sponge and small cakes like chocolate éclairs. 'She’ll only have one or two sandwiches and maybe a sliver of cake.’ Mr McGrady also spent his day making jam . pennies - miniature raspberry jam sandwiches cut into circles the size of an . old English penny - during his time in the Royal household. In the evening she would normally have a gin and Dubonnet; one part gin and two parts Dubonnet. The Queen's love of the drink is . well-documented, and when the BBC1 documentary The Royal Family At Work . showed a butler mixing one for her, demand for the product went through . the roof. Former Palace chef Darren McGrady . Then for dinner there would be game or fish such as pheasant from Sandringham or venison or salmon from Balmoral. For pudding, fresh fruit, particularly the white peaches grown in greenhouses at Windsor Castle. 'Game from any of the royal household were popular and peaches were her favourite.' Mr McGrady added. He started at Buckingham Palace in 1982, when he was 20, the most junior of 20 cooks in the kitchens, although he had already risen to chef de partie saucier (head sauce chef) at the Savoy. His royal CV has taken him to America, where he is now private chef to Mrs Dee Wyly, widow of a billionaire philanthropist in Dallas, Texas. But even now, he doubts the Queen has cooked a meal in her life. 'At the end of the meal, the Queen will rinse the plates, that’s her contribution. 'When I worked for Princess Diana, she’d occasionally cook a little something when she had friends over, maybe pasta with a sauce.But that’s something the Queen would never do.’ To celebrate the launch of New Tastier Flora and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, Darren McGrady has created the Flora Celebration Sandwich.

"Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz believes Lionel Messi is the 'best player ever' following Barcelona's Champions League victory over the French side on Wednesday night. Messi sparked Barca's comeback against PSG by scoring the equaliser in their 3-1 win at the Nou Camp - a result that saw them qualify as Group F winners at the expense of Laurent Blanc's side. And the Argentina star's performance really stood out, according to Luiz. Lionel Messi has been described as the 'best player ever' by Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz . Messi (left) scored Barcelona's equaliser in their 3-1 victory at home to PSG on Wednesday night . 'It's the efficiency that made the difference,' the Brazil centre half  told Canal+. 'They were better than us; they have three huge forwards. Messi is fantastic, the best player ever. 'Barca also have a smart head coach and other great players.' PSG knew a draw would see them finish top of their group and they were on course for victory after Zlatan Ibrahimovic put them ahead on 15 minutes. However, strikes from Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez changed the complexion of the match - with the performance of Barcelona's No 10 in particular standing out for Luiz. The defeat means PSG will now face one of the group winners in the last 16, with Luiz acknowledging the difficulty of the task their side could face in the next round. 'We will now think about the next step. The next game will be difficult. We'll have to beat everybody to go all the way. In February we could play anyone,' he added.

"Premier League clubs need to give their young players a bigger taste of life in the first-team and make them believe they can forge careers as professionals, according to Gary Neville. The former Manchester United and England defender fears that academy players do not have a clear pathway from youth to senior football and that the money invested in state-of-the-art facilities will be of little use if top-flight managers fail to take an interest in young talent. Manchester City unveiled their new £200million Football Academy earlier this week but Neville, who came through United's youth ranks, is adamant that clubs must immerse their youngsters in the first-team environment, too. Young Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek made his senior debut against Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville (right), pictured with Jamie Carragher, has had his say on academies . Young players take part in a training session at Manchester City's new £200million Football Academy . In his column for The Daily Telegraph, Neville wrote: 'When we were 16 or 17, in our early days as Manchester United YTS apprentices, Norman Davies, the kit man, would drive a couple of us in a white van to a first team game to help him put the kit out. 'We would sit in the first-team dressing room after laying out the shirts and shorts, waiting for the senior side to arrive. It was an incredible experience for us as young lads. I remember one trip with Chris Casper, over the top of the moors to Blackburn, when Rovers were doing well in the top flight, and listening to Sir Alex Ferguson rip into Gary Pallister for letting Alan Shearer pull off the back of him and score. 'Norman would look after us. We were there to absorb the first-team culture. We were there to understand how it worked, what it meant, and I remember how big it felt for me when the first team walked into that room, even though I had been at United from the age of 11. To travel with the kit and be immersed in the first-team ethos was to feel part of a continuous link from youth team to Premier League starting XI. It was an inspiration, a pathway all the way through the club.' Neville (left) broke into Manchester United's starting XI after being immersed in the first-team culture . City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarek speaks about the club's plans at the launch of their new academy . James Wilson has followed in Neville's footsteps by graduating from United's academy into the first-team . Neville admits that things changed at United when the club left The Cliff and moved to a new training base at Carrington, but he maintains that the system he came through gave him the best chance of making an impact under Sir Alex Ferguson. 'Academies are not about bricks and mortar,' he wrote. 'They are about culture and integration. What about a mentoring system, where a first-team player has a meal with a youth team player once a week and talks to him about standards? Should they not be pushed closer to the first-team rather than further away?' Chelsea gave a first-team debut to 18-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek against Sporting Lisbon, with the talented midfielder coming off the bench at Stamford Bridge. Blues boss Jose Mourinho had claimed Wednesday's game would be 'academy day', although Loftus-Cheek's late substitute appearance failed to back up his manager's words. Loftus-Cheek drives forward during Chelsea's Champions League win against Sporting Lisbon . Jose Mourinho is keen for Chelsea to develop players for the future despite spending big on foreign talent . Sky Sports pundit Neville added: 'Loftus-Cheek was paraded like some kind of exotic creature. Look, an academy player in the first-team! We lined up in the Sky studio excited at the thought of seeing homegrown talent in a Chelsea side. When he played for eight minutes, we showed the highlights of it as a special segment. We were seeing a rare species.' With every Premier League club keen to develop their own talent as Financial Fair Play rules hinder their ability to spend, the importance of academies has arguably never been greater. 'Chelsea and City have built the most incredible factories, but what really counts is the people, culture and most importantly belief and risk in giving youth a chance,' wrote Neville. 'It's time to follow through now. If they don't, these expensive academies will be just obscene cosmetic surgery.'","Manchester City have unveiled their new £200million Football Academy .

"Creed front man Scott Stapp believes he is an undercover CIA agent charged with assassinating President Obama, his worried family told a 911 dispatcher. Recently back home after a 72-hour psychiatric hold in Florida last last month, 41-year-old Stapp took off on a bicycle and disappeared - which caused his panicked wife and sister-in-law to phone the police to try and get them to commit him again. 'He thinks he's part of the CIA,' said Jaclyn Strapp to the dispatcher. 'He thinks they're trying to kill him, and he has a bunch of paperwork in his backpack that he's a CIA agent and he is supposed to assassinate Obama', said her sister. Scroll Down to Listen to Audio . Troubled: Creed frontman Scott Stapp has reportedly threatened to kill President Obama and fled his home on a bike - worrying his wife Jaclyn (right) who phoned 911 . They implored the dispatcher to get an officer after Stapp, who was cycling shirtless around his Florida neighborhood, carrying a backpack of tools and 600 pages of CIA documents he printed from the Internet. 'He's off the drugs, and he's going crazy,' said Jaclyn Strapp's sister to the 911 dispatcher according to TMZ. However, while on his bike, the star decided to phone 911 himself. He told police that his wife had stolen his truck and reduced him to using the bike. But, when police found him they decided he was in control of his faculties and declined to commit him. In November, Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video post. Threats: Stapp reportedly threatened the life of the president - seen here today in the Eisenhower Executive Office in Washington D.C. for a meeting with his President's Export Council . Husband and father: Scott is shown in May 2010 with Jaclyn and their son Jagger from his previous marriage and their daughter Milan . 'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of god, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck,' the 41-year-old rocker admitted on camera. 'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.' The Grammy winner - whose net worth was once $10M - sold an estimated 53 million records worldwide with his neo-grunge band in their nineties heyday. 'All hell broke loose' around two months ago when the IRS audited Scott's record company and personal finances. 'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless,' Stapp stated. 'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, ""Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months."" I don't understand how that's fair America.' 'I went two days without eating and I ended up in an emergency room': Creed frontman Scott Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video posted in November . Cryptic: He also posted a message to Facebook on Friday saying it was his 'last statement' The With Arms Wide Open hitmaker also claimed 'someone' used his passwords to transfer all the money out of his bank accounts. 'A lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me, or royalties not paid,' Scott continued. 'There are people that have taken advantage and stolen money from me and they're trying to spread vicious lies and discredit me.' And at the end of the month, Jaclyn Stapp had her estranged husband admitted to a substance abuse facility. The former Miss New York USA beauty queen claimed her husband has been using several drugs and threatened to kill himself and harm his family. Jaclyn said he left their home in early October. 'It is a very painful and personal matter for the family,' said Jason Brodie, Jaclyn Stapp's attorney. 'Jaclyn loves Scott very much. It is now apparent the seriousness of Scott's health. Jaclyn has taken all the necessary steps to help him,' Brodie said. 'She previously arranged for the appropriate treatment and will continue to try and help him. Her primary concern remains the best interest of their children. Jaclyn asks for privacy for her and her children during this difficult time,' the attorney added.

"The statement he made summed up the rivalry. In September 2002, Sir Alex Ferguson was asked about the great challenge Manchester United were facing at that particular time. 'My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their ******* perch,' he responded. 'And you can print that.' He eventually realised his ambition, in May 2011, when United secured their 19th league title. It might have been symbolic for the general public but, speaking from a Liverpool perspective, there was no dwelling on what they achieved. Our focus was on how we could turn the situation around.

He was an empire on his own, one of the biggest influences on football this country has seen but, suddenly, his departure transformed things. There was a glimmer of light to exploit. Look at what happened: Liverpool beat United twice, the second time being with the most emphatic performance I can remember a Liverpool team producing at Old Trafford. They were even awarded three penalties that day – would that have happened with Ferguson in the dugout? So it was crucial Liverpool made the right steps following that thumping 3-0 victory in March; first by winning the league and then, crucially, with successful player recruitment. Doing that would have made things difficult for United – who had not ended up below Liverpool in the table for 12 years – to get back into the Champions League at the first chance. Gerrard onhis haunches after Liverpool were knocked out of the Champions League on Tuesday night . Manchester United are on the up and Van Persie (left) celebrates his winner at Southampton on Monday . Yet here we are on December 13, exactly seven months after the last campaign ended, and United are back on the front foot, third in the table. They are an average side, compared to Ferguson's teams of the past, but being in transition has not hindered their ambitions. In adding Angel di Maria and Luke Shaw, United bought the better players. Liverpool may have spent more than £100million but where has it left them? And when will they be able to lavish such a figure again? Looking at them now, you feel they need another £100m spending just to improve. Once you begin to examine the respective finances of both clubs, you see the extent of the power behind United. Their recently published accounts showed they brought in revenue of £433.2m in 2013-14. Liverpool's, by comparison, was £206.1m. Old Trafford, with 30,000 more seats, is a money-making machine. Yes, Liverpool are getting a fantastic new Main Stand, which will be ready in August 2016, but it will take time for benefits to be felt. While Anfield is being revamped, United's £750m kit deal with adidas will kick in. Van Persie (left) and Wayne Rooney will be the main threats for United at Old Trafford on Sunday . United, including former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes (left) are put through their paces at Carrington . Louis van Gaal (left) oversees proceedings in preparation for the biggest match in English football . When you consider all that, it proves United could – if they desire – spend £100m every summer. Liverpool have never had that luxury and it feels like, once again, they have handed their most bitter rivals a 'get out of jail free' card. The Premier League table, showing Manchester United in third and Liverpool ninth . It keeps happening. When we finished second to Arsenal in 2002, the next step was to win the league. We were outstanding in the cups, as our treble in 2001 showed, and we had beaten United in five consecutive games over two campaigns. The right moves would have given us a great chance. Instead, we bought El Hadji Diouf, Bruno Cheyrou and Salif Diao for £20m, all of whom failed. That same summer, United paid £29.3m to smash the British transfer record for Rio Ferdinand, Ferguson fixed his defence and, 12 months later, they were champions. United have an ability to land 'star' names with Di Maria offering the latest proof. In my time at Liverpool, it was all about developing players to become stars yet surely last summer was the moment for them to show they could compete at the highest transfer level? Rafa Benitez used to say Liverpool had 'to be perfect' when buying players to compete with United but he made mistakes, just like Gerard Houllier did before and all the others who succeeded him. When that keeps happening, is it any surprise a gulf exists between the clubs? History shows the dominance in this rivalry goes in cycles. United, with the Busby Babes and three league titles, were the teams of the 1950s. They added a European Cup in 1968 but Liverpool, during the Sixties, were a becoming an irresistible force under Bill Shankly. The moment Manchester United knocked Liverpool off their perch - Sir Alex Ferguson with the Premier League trophy in 2011, which was his club's 19th title, taking them ahead of their great rivals . Sports analysts Bloomberg Sports believe a Man United win is the most likely outcome against Liverpool . That led to Liverpool's total superiority in the 1970s and 1980s before it swung again, with United and Ferguson dominating the Premier League era. This conflict has always ebbed and flowed and achievements are evenly matched; Liverpool have 59 major trophies. United have 58. Without Ferguson, though, they looked vulnerable. They experienced great change at a number of levels, first with David Moyes and then Louis van Gaal, and had Liverpool played their cards right, they could have finally reasserted themselves and left United scrambling catch up. Now you cannot escape the conclusion Liverpool are doing the scrambling. Going out of the Champions League on Tuesday night was a savage blow and my initial fear was that after waiting five years to return to that competition, it could be another few years before they get back in again. United, on the other hand, look like they are resuming normal service. They need working on before they reach a title-winning level once more but they remain on their perch they claimed in May 2011. Liverpool have let them off the hook. Win a trophy and Pardew’s turnaround is complete . The transformation in Alan Pardew’s fortunes at Newcastle is one of the stories of the season and he deserved to enjoy the Chelsea win. It shows what can happen when clubs persevere with managers, and victory at Arsenal tonight would propel them into the top five. Given the confidence he and his players have, Newcastle will believe they can get a result at the Emirates. Alan Pardew poses with his Manager of the Month award for November . Realistically, though, how long will Newcastle stay there? Sooner or later, the clubs with better resources will elbow them away from the Champions League spots. If Newcastle finish seventh or eighth, it represents a good season. Pardew, however, has a chance to make it a memorable one. They have a quarter-final in the Capital One Cup at Tottenham on Wednesday and they will not want to squander that opportunity. Newcastle’s fans are desperate for silverware and, if Pardew can deliver, people would really sit up and take notice of the job he has done. Pardew celebrates with assistant John Carver after Newcastle beat Chelsea last weekend . Football is all about winning trophies. Everyone praised Newcastle for finishing fifth in 2012 but supporters will never say: ‘Remember that year we qualified for the Europa League?’ They want to talk about famous days at Wembley and, for Newcastle, it has been too long coming. Like Pardew, Sam Allardyce at West Ham has worked hard to turn things round. But if they want to change perceptions, a trophy would do that. THIS WEEK I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO: Seeing Andy Carroll... go back to war . I know from experience that when Andy Carroll is in the mood and he gets the right kind of service, he is unplayable. He is a nightmare for defenders to handle. John O’Shea and Wes Brown, then, will be bracing themselves for what is headed in their direction this afternoon at the Stadium of Light. Carroll was outstanding in West Ham’s win over Swansea last week and he will want to build on it. West Ham's Andy Carroll celebrates after scoring against Swansea last week . The corresponding game last season between Sunderland and West Ham was shown on Monday Night Football and Carroll absolutely tormented Brown and O’Shea. Carroll knocked Brown over when scoring and O’Shea ended up being substituted. Sunderland’s defenders had a straightforward afternoon at Anfield seven days ago when keeping a clean sheet but if Carroll is in the frame of mind he showed against Swansea, it will be anything but for Gus Poyet’s men. It will make for interesting viewing.","Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United knocked Liverpool off their perch in 2011 when they won their 19th title .

"A pig that weighed in at nearly one ton was publicly slaughtered today after its owner won first prize on a competition held by a Taoist temple in Taiwan. Ten Holy Pigs were force fed to make them grow ten times larger than normal for the contest held by the Sanhsia Tzushih Temple in Yingko, New Taipei City, northern Taiwan. The winning pig weighed in at a staggering 936kg and appeared in public looking like a porcine equivalent of Star Wars villain Jabba the Hut. Scroll down for video . Holy Pig! Taiwanese Taoists wait to see a Holy Pig to be dragged out and killed at Yingko, New Taipei City, northern Taiwan, during the Holy Pig Contest held by the Taoist Sanhsia Tzushih Temple . Farmers compete to raise the heaviest pig for the annual event, which culminates with all the animals having their throats cut in public to please the gods. The temple authorities award the farmer with the fattest pig a prize in gold for his achievement. The tradition is generations old, but in recent years it has attracted fierce criticism and public protests from advocates of animal rights. They say the contest is cruel, alleging that the pigs often kept in small enclosures and hit on the snout to force them to keep eating, and have demanded that it is abolished. Hog tied: A fork truck prepares to transport a Holy Pig from its owner's home to an open space near the temple where it will have its throat cut as an offering to the gods as part of the New Year's festivities . Men shave the prize-winning Holy Pig after it was killed: This pig, weighing 936kg, won its owner a prize in pure gold, but animal rights activists have called for an end to the contest, which they say is 'abusive and brutal' Temple officials have previously said that they will phase out the competition by 2017, but this year they said merely that they planned to stop handing out gold prizes to winning owners. Activists have accused them of paying 'lip service' to criticisms of the practise, which they denounce as 'abusive and brutal'.","Winning owner awarded a prize of pure gold by the temple in New Taipei City .

"Manchester City midfielder James Milner is poised to sign a new contract at the Etihad Stadium, manager Manuel Pellegrini has confirmed. The England international, who joined City from Aston Villa for £26million in 2010, is in the final year of his current deal. The 28-year-old has played a prominent role for the Barclays Premier League champions in the first half of the season, featuring in all but two of their 24 games in all competitions. James Milner is poised to extend his stay at Manchester City with a new contract, says boss Manuel Pellegrini . Milner's future had been the subject of speculation due to his lack of starts last season but his prominence this term - starting 13 times - appears to have changed that. The development comes after goalkeeper Joe Hart admitted this week he was also ready to sign fresh terms. Pellegrini said: 'Milner, I hope that he will sign also. We will see, same as Joe, in the next days. 'I don't know how many days before we can have this as official news but I suppose that also he will sign and continue here because he also wants to stay.' Milner (right) has featured in all but two of City's 24 games in all competitions this season . Pellegrini first revealed that a deal with Hart was close a week ago but he could not confirm when anything would be finalised. The Chilean, speaking at a press conference to preview this weekend's game at Leicester, said: 'It is very close, I suppose. 'As you know, Joe wants to stay here. We also want him to be our goalkeeper so I hope it will be ready as soon as possible. I don't think that we are going to have any problems.' City goalkeeper Joe Hart (far left) is also close to agreeing a new deal at the club . Pellegrini also had no news on a possible new deal for Frank Lampard, whose loan deal from sister club New York City expires at the end of the month. The former England midfielder has proved a success in his short stint at City, leading to speculation his stay could be prolonged to cover Yaya Toure's involvement in the African Nations Cup. But, once again, Pellegrini would say nothing beyond the fact the matter would be looked at sometime in December. He said: 'I said during December. For the moment, no (news).' Frank Lampard (right) is set to leave City at the end of December when his loan spell from New York City ends .","James Milner is in the final year of his current Manchester City contract .

"Tiger Woods will have to raise his game to a higher level than ever before to beat Rory McIlroy, according to Colin Montgomerie. Woods has been a shadow of the golfer he once was following serious back injuries this year and finished last in his most recent comeback following major surgery. But the American superstar has 14 majors to his name, including four won in row across 2000 and 2001, a feat dubbed the 'Tiger Slam' and hailed by many as the greatest golf ever played. McIlroy, meanwhile, has seized Woods's crown as the undisputed world No 1 and won this year's Open and US PGA Championship in spectacular style to take his own total to four. The 25-year-old Northern Irishman will be bidding for three in a row at the Masters in April, a title won by Woods on four occasions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Colin Montgomerie on Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods . Rory McIlroy is the reigning Open and US PGA champion and the world No 1 golfer . Tiger Woods has been beset by serious back injuries and question marks hang over his future in the game . There are question marks over whether Woods, now approaching his 39th birthday, will ever regain his best form. But Montgomerie warned his former rival that McIlroy is now playing golf that surpasses anything he has ever achieved. 'Tiger Woods is going to come back into the frame,' Mongomerie told Kicca.com when discussing next year's Masters. 'Is he going to be able to get back, not just to the levels he was but better than that? Because that’s where Rory McIlroy's taken the standard of golf: to one level beyond where Tiger was.' McIlroy suffered a spectacular meltdown in the final round at Augusta National in 2011 after holding a four-shot lead after 54 holes. But Montgomerie insisted McIlroy is 'a much better golfer now than he was then' and backed him to win the Masters. 'You'd have to say McIlroy is favourite. It's about time he won it,' added the Scot, who was Europe's No 1 golfer for eight years  but never won a major championship. Montgomerie duelled with Woods for The Open at St Andrews in 2005 but was beaten into second place. Montgomerie also looked even further ahead, tipping McIlroy to claim a second US Open at Chambers Bay in June and thus a career Grand Slam of majors. McIlroy will bid for a career Grand Slam at the Masters, where he suffered a meltdown in 2011 . Woods once captured four majors in succession, from the US Open in 2000 to the Masters in 2001 . The Ryder Cup legend was even prepared to speculate that McIlroy could go on to win all four majors in 2015, which would be six in a row, an unprecedented feat in the sport. 'If he does win the Masters that US Open will be a big, big, big do indeed,' said Montgomerie. 'Can he win all four in a year? That’s another question on people’s lips within our game. Can he win all four in a year, never mind two? That means six in a row. Wow, that’ll be something. 'If you’re a betting man - I’m sure there’s a lot of people putting money on it - I’m sure it’s a 100-1 shot but it’s worth a punt.' Colin Montgomerie has been in action in Mauritius this week on the European Senior Tour . The odds of McIlroy winning all four majors in 2015 are currently 80-1 with many bookmakers. Montgomerie added: 'If I was a gambler, which I’m not, I’d put money on that; he’s that dominant, and that good.'","Tiger Woods will have to play his best ever golf to beat Rory McIlroy, says Colin Montgomerie .

But, instead of appearing down in the dumps, Rodgers' squad enjoyed a laugh and a joke in training on Friday - hugging each other, playing handball and generally seeming to enjoy themselves during the season.

"Mario Balotelli has accepted a Football Association charge for posting an allegedly abusive or insulting image on social media. The Liverpool striker was in breach of rule E3 [1] and had until 6pm on Monday, December 15 to submit how he will answer. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli back in training on Friday after recovering from groin problem . The Italy international was charged a week ago with breaching FA rule E3(1) as a result of his posting of an image of computer game character Super Mario on Instagram which included the words 'jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew'. His offence was deemed to be an 'aggravated breach', as defined by rule E3(2), as it included a reference to ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality or religion or belief. Balotelli helped lift the mood at Liverpool after Tuesday's Champions League exit . Having worked closely with Liverpool since he was charged, Balotelli has admitted he is in breach of the FA's social media guidelines but he will offer mitigation. The 24-year-old has not requested a personal hearing, instead he has submitted written mitigation. When first asked for his observations by the FA after he reposted an image of the computer game character Super Mario, Balotelli submitted evidence of how he has been racially abused on social media. The Liverpool striker insisted that he meant no offence by tweeting that his mother is Jewish . That, however, did not stopped the FA taking action. The FA added in a statement last week: 'It is further alleged that this is an ‘Aggravated Breach’ as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.’ There is no timeline for when the issue will be closed.

Sportsmail takes a look at some more of Balotelli's on and off-field incidents during his time in English football. CAR CRASH (August 2010) Just days after signing for City, Balotelli hits the headlines after crashing his Audi R8 en route to the club's training ground. Balotelli is found to be carrying £5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police ask why, he reportedly replies: 'Because I am rich.' FIRST RED CARD (November 2010) Balotelli scores his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 win at West Brom but the achievement is marred when he is sent off following a clash with Youssouf Mulumbu. WILSHERE SNUB (December 2010) City boss Roberto Mancini says Balotelli must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of Jack Wilshere after beating the Arsenal midfielder to FIFA's Young Player of the Year award.

"Friday night football is coming to the Premier League, Sportsmail can reveal, with the league's governing body making the shock decision to put Friday matches up for sale for the first time. Tender documents for live UK rights to England's top division have been made available to interested broadcasters from Friday - firing the starting pistol on what is sure to be a hotly contested and massively lucrative battle for rights between 2016 and 2019. The announcement also means that more Premier League football will be shown live on TV than ever before from the 2016-17 season. Champions Manchester City are set for Premier League games on a Friday night under a new rights package . - 168 matches will be available to be shown live from 2016 - 14 more than currently. - Up to 10 of those matches will be shown live on Friday evenings. - The 168 games will be split into seven packages - five of 28 matches and two packages of 14 matches. No single buyer will be allowed to acquire more than five packages or 126 matches. - The ITT will include an auction for a free-to-air highlights package, held by the BBC's Match of the Day since 2004. - The current total value of the domestic broadcast rights deals is £3.018billion over three years. - An announcement on the 2016-19 rights is expected by early March. - A later auction will take place for 212 'near-live' matches to be accessed on-demand, and for internet-based clips. - The ITT will protect the Saturday 3pm 'closed period' where games kicking off then are not shown live. From August 2016 broadcasters will be able to show 168 games live, a huge 44 per cent of all top flight matches throughout the season. The announcement is an increase from the current deal, which allows 154 matches per year, and ran from the beginning of last season. Under the new offer no single broadcaster will be able to show more than 126 of the live matches, with at least two of the seven packages of games to be shown on other channels. The deals are expected to be completed in February, but the Invitation to Tender (ITT) opens the way for broadcasters to begin planning their bids. The last deal, worth a total of £3.018billion was split between Sky, who won five packages - making up 116 games - and BT, who bought the remaining two packages totalling 38 games. Sky paid £2.28bn for their current 116 games per season, or in other words, got 348 games at £6,551,724 each. BT paid £738m for their current 38 games per season, or in other words, got 114 games at £6,473,684 each. The billion-dollar question is how much they will both be prepared to spend to keep or increase the games they have in 2016-19. Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and that number could go up with the new deal . The appeal of stars like Wayne Rooney have made live Premier League matches attractive for broadcasters . Sergio Aguero, November's Premier League player of the month, could now be scoring goals on a Friday . BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013 . There will still be a restriction on showing any live football beginning at 3pm on a Saturday, but the increase in available matches means there will be a decline in the number of games . The Premier League have also opened the market for it's free-to-air highlights package, currently held by the BBC in the form of Match of the Day. It is thought that ITV, who held the rights between 2001 and 2004 with their show The Premiership, are considering bidding for the contract.","New Premier League TV licensing deal tendered to interested parties .
From 2016, 168 games will be shown live each season .

"A University of Arizona Professor  is under fire after suggesting the the U.S. military poses a bigger threat than ISIS. In an article Musa al-Gharbi who is an instructor in the university's Department of Government and Public Service program says, 'it would not be a stretch to say that the United States is actually a greater threat to peace and stability in the region than ISIS.' The piece, entitled How Much Moral High Ground Does the US Have Over ISIS? the instructor portrays American soldiers as anti-Muslim rapists who commit crimes on par with - or even worse than ISIS itself. Outspoken: University of Arizona faculty member Musa al-Gharbi claimed in an online column that the U.S. military is as much of a threat to Middle East peace as ISIS . Al-Gharbi's comments, published in the online publication TruthOut and several other places, attracted outrage from experts who said that taxpayer funds should not be supplementing a university that encourages such dialogue about current events. 'U.S. policies in Iraq, Libya, and Syria have largely paved the way for ISIS's emergence as a major regional actor,' al-Gharbi wrote. Al-Gharbi argues that the isolated instances of U.S. soldiers committing atrocities including rape, for which they face court-martial and imprisonment if found guilty, are on a level with the widespread and systematic brutality of Islamic State radicals . 'Many of the same behaviors condemned by the Obama administration and used to justify its most recent campaign into Iraq and Syria are commonly perpetrated by U.S. troops and are ubiquitous in the broader American society,' al-Gharbi said. Blunt: Al-Gharbi claimed that the isolated instances of U.S. soldiers committing atrocities including rape, for which they face court-martial and imprisonment if found guilty, are on a level with the widespread and systematic brutality of Islamic State radicals . Vocal: Al-Gharbi also claimed that the U.S. military has been 'heavily infiltrated by white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups.' 'The initial driver of U.S. involvement was the outrage over ISIS' capture of thousands of Yazidi women and the sexual violence subsequently exercised against them—horrors which provided moral credence to the war against ISIS in much the same way that the 2001 U.S. war against the Taliban was justified in part by highlighting the plight of Afghan women living under their rule,' he wrote. 'However, over the course of that war, and the subsequent 2003 war in Iraq, U.S. soldiers and contractors repeatedly used rape as a weapon of war, both against prisoners and the local civilian population,' al-Gharbi writes. 'But perhaps more disturbing than the crimes committed by U.S. personnel against Iraqis and Afghans were the atrocities committed by servicemen against their fellow soldiers.' 'U.S. soldiers and contractors have and continue to torture their enemies, often taking obscene photos to brag about and reminisce upon their acts,' al-Gharbi writes. He then goes on to claim that the U.S. military has been 'heavily infiltrated by white-supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups.' Candid: Al-Gharbi said he is trying address tough questions in provocative ways . Critics of the piece are calling for the University of Arizona to condemn his views. The University of Arizona has issued at statement regarding the article: . Musa al-Gharbi, the author of the opinion piece, was not writing for any part of his employment at the University of Arizona. He is a limited term adjunct instructor who teaches one class this semester and is a member of a volunteer research collective that receives no state or university funding. He wrote the editorial as a private citizen. The op-ed is his personal opinion and labeled as such. The ideas expressed in Mr. al-Ghabri's opinion piece have offended and distressed many in the University of Arizona community and beyond. We also acknowledge his First Amendment right that allows him to publish his thoughts as a private citizen.","Musa al-Gharbi argued that America’s moral outrage at IS’s crimes is hypocritical .

"Joleon Lescott has played against some of the best strikers in the world, but the West Brom defender came across a real sharp-shooter when he spoke with young Aston Villa fan Moin Younis. In an interview with BBC Midlands Today, the pair exchanged banter as they spoke about this Saturday's West Midlands derby at The Hawthorns. Taking part in their annual Christmas visit to Birmingham Children's Hospital, the Baggies players were doing their bit to help raise funds for the construction of a playroom for each ward... although young Moin seemed to be having enough fun without one. Joleon Lescott met 15-year-old Aston Villa fan Moin Younis during West Brom's annual Christmas visit . The young Villa supporter appeals to the camera as he claims Lescott was grabbing his favourite robe . 15-year-old Moin, from Handsworth, was speaking with a BBC Midlands Today reporter when Lescott emerged from the background and put his arm around him. In true footballer style Moin flagged up the contact, as if appealing to a referee. 'By the way guys, he's just grabbed me... I'm a Villa fan,'  Moin shouted as he kissed the badge on his robe. From here on in Lescott knew he had met his match and the sparring continued as he retorted: 'We're going to take a picture later with his robe off. 'You said you was going to come to the game (on Saturday) in a West Brom shirt!' Quick to dispel any confusion Moin said: 'I'm Villa's number one fan... they will all know its a lie!' The youngster even had time to mock his unlikely Christmas angel, who said he would return on Monday to give him some stick if Villa lose. The pair exchanged light hearted banter in the ward as they spoke about Saturday's West Midlands clash . Lescott left his new friend with a high-five after telling him he'd return on Monday if West Brom win . 'He had something to say about that (Lescott's move from Manchester City). 'He said, ""why would I do it?"", I said ""I'm close to home now aren't I?. Back home in Birmingham""... He's even digging about my accent!' West Brom will want to make amends for giving away a two goal lead in this fixture last season, something young Moin hadn't forgotten. 'I didnt play,' Lescott said, 'I wasn't even there but I'm still at blame aren't I?' he asked his new friend. Baggies captain Chris Brunt will be missing for Saturday's derby after failing to recover from a hamstring injury. Jonas Olsson is also out following an operation on his Achilles but Saido Berahino is set for a recall after being dropped to the bench for the goalless draw at Hull and Claudio Yacob is available following a ban.

"In an email sent to Sony's top lawyer and other high ranking executives at the company, one former employee alleges a workplace of horrors, filled with sexual harassment, racism, verbal abuse and gender bias. An unnamed African-American woman who worked for Keith Le Goy, President of International Distribution at Sony Pictures Television, claims she and other African-American coworkers were passed over for promotions in favor of less experienced Caucasian employees, that she was the victim of frequent expletive-laden verbal attacks and she alleges that Le Goy sexually harassed her on multiple occasions . The email was sent to Sony Pictures chief counsel Leah Weil, Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton, and Sony Pictures Television President Steve Mosko. Scroll down for video . Leaked: A new email sent to head Sony lawyer Leah Weil (right, with Amy Pascal) alleges a workplace of racism, abuse and harassment at Sony . Head honcho: An African-American woman who worked for Keith Le Goy, President of International Distribution at Sony Pictures Television, claims she was frequently mistreated . In the loop: The email was also sent to Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton, and Sony Pictures Television President Steve Mosko . Le Goy, who is said to have denied most of the allegations, is also on the email, and is told by lawyers for the company not to 'respond to the email or otherwise engage with her.' The email was obtained by Gawker, and written by the former employee just one day after she was terminated from the company. 'I have worked for executives at Sony for approximately 7 years, the last 5+ of which have been in International Distribution assisting Keith Le Goy,' the email begins. 'My experience in the International Distribution department has been marred by disparate and unfair treatment in promotion and hiring practices, harassment, retaliation, bullying women, name-calling, offensive language, threats, blocking my advancement and transfers, withholding information to paint a negative opinion, maligning, unsolicited hugs and invitations, resulting in sexual harassment and drinking during work hours in the office.' From there, the writer lists some specific incidents of harassment and abuse, as well as what she deems to be racist practices. 'So the situation is a Caucasian person promoted twice above the more experienced, more senior African-American person and the African-American has yet to get the title for the job that she actually does,' writes the former employee. 'My case isn't isolated, my African-American tub mate, works for the same SVP, now EVP, who promoted Monica in 18 months, has not given her, the African-American assistant the classification for the job she is doing—Admin III. The only other African-American in our department in the last 10 years, was Paul Bledsoe, who was laid-off in 2009, after 10 years as a Manager. I asked to take over some of his duties and learn more and was rebuffed; another Caucasian was hired 5 months later.' As for Le Goy's behavior, she writes; 'In January 2009, Keith harassed me by yelling at me, charging at my desk for dial-in instructions, after providing them, I hastened out and he chased, blocked my exit and threatened me not to take overtime, in front of several witnesses. 'I was terrified. This anger was in retaliation for my having reported him to the Ethics Hotline 3 weeks earlier, when he called me ""[Expletive] useless,"" and slammed his computer down for emphasis in front of a female VP.' Buds: Le Goy (right, with Mosko and actor Oliver Platt) denied most of the woman's allegations . Bad timing: This comes just days after a racist email exchange between Pascal and producer Scott Rudin about President Obama was leaked . The writer shares a few more incidents similar in nature, with profane rants and the slamming of things. As for the sexual harassment, she says Le Goy invited her to spend time alone in his office on multiple occasions . 'The beginnings of the sexual abuse occurred in 2007 when he asked me to join him while he serenaded HR and Operations managers in his dimmed office' she says. 'I refused him twice saying that I had an abundance of work to complete. The final time that he asked, he offered me, ""Veuve Cliquot with HR, I told him in no uncertain terms, ""I don't drink."" He yelled slapping at me, ""Then, you're not on my team!"" 'Initially, it seemed like a joke, later it became apparent with the comments, like I'm imperious and then he began calling me a ""Bitch"" in many incarnations and that became de rigueur in the office.' The email closes by saying, 'I need someone to protect me from Keith.' This leaked email comes just days after one in which Sony Chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin made racist remarks about President Barack Obama. On the eve of a fundraising breakfast in November 2013 being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event. 'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery in the antebellum South. '12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave, a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in America. The pair then keep going, listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name, including Lee Daniels' The Butler and two Kevin Hart movies, Think Like a Man and Ride Along. 'I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' says Rudin at one point. Not having it: Shonda Rhimes called out Pascal and Rudin on Twitter . African-American television giant Shonda Rhimes said of the emails on Twitter, 'Calling Sony comments ""racially insensitive remarks"" instead of 'racist'?' she tweeted. 'U can put a cherry on a pile of s*** but it don't make it a sundae.' Pascal, who says she is not racist, issued an apology on Thursday, saying; 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.' She then added, 'although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.'","An email written by a Sony employee to the company's head lawyer alleges a workplace of harassment and abuse .

"Ed Miliband today tried to laugh of questions about his future, denying his leadership was in crisis. The Labour leader used his first appearance since claims one in five of his frontbench team want him to quit to insist it was a 'privilege' to do his job and he does not wish his brother David was in the job instead. Mr Miliband tried to woo business leaders with a promise never to take Britain out of the European Union, accusing David Cameron of playing 'political games' after the Prime Minister hinted he could back exit without significant changes to Britain's relationship with Brussels. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband today tried to laugh off questions about his future, denying his leadership was in crisis . Senior Labour figures have admitted the party is having 'jitters' about Mr Miliband's stewardship of the party . A new opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election . Support for Mr Miliband has plummeted even among his party's supporters. Pollsters YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago. The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader. Senior Labour figures have publicly admitted the party is having 'jitters' about Mr Miliband's stewardship of the party, and have issued a put up or shut up plea for plotters to 'show us your colours'. Today Mr Miliband attempted to brush off the reports, saying he agreed that 'you shouldn't believe everything you read in the papers'. Appearing at the CBI conference in London, Mr Miliband - who beat his brother David to the Labour leadership - was asked if he wished 'the other guy had won'. Mr Miliband said: 'Definitely not. 'It is a huge privilege doing this job. What excites me is the way we can transform this country. The country has huge advantages, huge talent.' Asked if he agreed there was a 'crisis of confidence' in his leadership, he replied curtly: 'No.' Instead he sought to use his appearance in a room of industry leaders to burnish his business credentials with an unashamedly pro-European speech. Mr Miliband told the CBI conference in London that it was a 'huge privilege' to be Labour party leader . The Labour leader warned threats to leave the EU risked putting the UK 'on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off' Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna . Senior Labour figures today publicly rallied behind Ed Miliband. But their attempt to shore up Mr Miliband's position risked being derailed when shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna - widely tipped as a possible future leader - appeared to muddle him up with his elder brother David. Mr Umunna admitted there were 'noises off' about Mr Miliband's leadership, but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It is a small minority of people, who are doing so anonymously and off the record.' However, in a later interview, Mr Umunna appeared to mix Ed up with brother David, who he defeated by a narrow margin in the 2010 contest for the leadership. The shadow business secretary told Sky News: 'I know, for my constituency, (we have) a united Labour Party in ensuring that we get David, um, that we get Ed Miliband into No 10. I know ultimately that that's what's going to make a difference to their lives.' The Tories have promised to renegotiate the UK's membership before an in-out referendum, but Labour today suggested it would be 'dangerous' to give the public a say. Support for leaving the EU has risen in recent weeks, in part as a result over the shock demand for Britain to pay an extra £1.7billion to Brussels coffers, which has since been cut to £850million. Mr Cameron has toughened his position in the face of a surge in backing for Ukip. Today he insisted Britain cannot secure reform of the European Union by just saying it will 'stick with whatever we have come what may'. However, in a speech to the CBI, Mr Miliband ruled out ever threatening Britain's membership of the EU. He said: 'There are some people in our country who advocate exit from the EU. 'There are others who flirt with it, thinking they can do so without consequence and perhaps with advantage to Britain. 'In my view both are equally dangerous. Giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the EU, or contemplating it, simply drags us closer to exit. 'And every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business.' In an attempt to shore up Labour support among pro-EU business leaders, he will claim that 'ever-more incoherent demands' from Mr Cameron has made Britain 'ever-more isolated from its partners', putting the UK 'on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off'. Mr Miliband added: 'If I am Prime Minister I will never risk your businesses, British jobs, British prosperity by playing political games with our membership of the European Union. 'The way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them. Not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them. Not to make promises everyone knows you cannot keep.' Mr Cameron is due to set out detailed proposals for reforming freedom of movement rules before the end of the year in an attempt to reduce the flow. He has pledged to put Britain's EU membership to an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives form the next government in 2015. Appearing at the CBI this morning, the Prime Minister defended his plan to put freedom of movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation. Mr Miliband sought to laugh off growing doubts about his leadership, and rejected the idea he wished his brother David (right) was in charge . The PM said: 'You never get anywhere in life unless you have a clear strategy and a plan,' he used his own address to the gathering to declare. 'And you never get anywhere unless that strategy and that plan includes all the things that matter to your customers and your shareholders. 'Britain's future in Europe matters to our country and it isn't working properly at the moment and that is why we need to make changes. 'I agree with what the CBI has said: we should be looking for a reformed European Union. 'Now I am the politician who has the plan for that reform. Who wants to see the single market safeguarded and not have us ordered around by the single currency countries. 'Who wants to make sure we belong to a Europe that is about a common market and co-operation and not about ever-closer union. Prime Minister David Cameron, at the CBI conference today, warned Britain cannot secure reform of the European Union by just saying it will 'stick with whatever we have come what may' 'And I want to be part of a Europe that addresses people's concerns including concerns about immigration. 'I am clear: these things can be done. These things can be negotiated and we can then hold that referendum and give people a proper choice about staying in a reformed European Union or opting not to belong to it.' In a clear dig at Mr Miliband, he went on: 'That is a plan. That is a strategy to secure the best future for Britain. 'Simply standing here and just saying 'I will stay in Europe, I will stick with whatever we have come what may' that is not a strategy, that is not a plan and that will not work.' CBI president Sir Michael Rake said four out of every five CBI members would vote to stay in the European Union in a referendum because it was 'overwhelmingly' in the UK's national interest. 'Do not be fooled - by withdrawing from Europe, we do not somehow become more open to trade elsewhere. Instead we turn inwards, going against the grain of an increasingly connected world.'","Labour leader gives first speech since leadership was engulfed in crisis .

"It was not a job for the squeamish. Wildlife workers today began the distasteful task of chopping up a dead 20-ton beached whale - with a chainsaw.

Experts from Sydney’s National Parks and Wildlife Service had hoped to be able to move the 35-foot (11m) carcass in one piece to a landfill site for burial, but eventually realised they would have to cut it up. Wearing white protective suits, gloves and face masks, they started up their chainsaws and began sawing through the blubber. Hundreds of onlookers were kept well away because of the sickening stench. ‘It’s like an entire fish shop has gone off,’ said local resident Fergus Woolveridge, pinching his nose.

"A gigantic statue of Lenin has been torn down by Ukrainian nationalists who cheered and chanted as they cut off the Communist monument's metal nose. Flares and anti-Russian slogans erupted from a crowd of thousands last night as the statue came crashing to the ground in Kharkiv's Freedom Square. The protesters, many of them masked, carved the words 'Glory to Ukraine' on the plinth of the monument, which was destroyed with the permission of the regional government. Scroll down for video . Goodbye Lenin: One of the largest remaining statues of the Communist leader was torn down last night by Ukrainian nationalists in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which is just 25 miles from the border with Russia . Destroyed: As the 50-year-old monument came crashing to the ground there were cheers and a flare was let off. Ukraine's interior minister Arsen Avakov called it a 'bloody Communist idol' and celebrated its destruction . Memento: A protester carried the nose and top lip of the giant statue through the crowd in Freedom Square . Even Ukraine's interior minister joined celebrations at the vanquishing of what he called the 'bloody Communist idol'. At around 28ft tall, it was said to be the largest Lenin statue in Ukraine and had stood in Kharkiv's central square since 1964. It came crashing down in a cloud of dust last night after protesters spent several hours taking heavy cutting equipment to the base of the metal monument. With hundreds of voices chanting slogans and the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag draped from the plinth, they took hammers to the statue's face and removed its nose before carrying it through the crowd. Kharkiv is just 25 miles from Ukraine's border with Russia, and like the neighbouring cities of Luhansk and Donetsk it was overrun by gangs of pro-Russian separatists in April. Unlike its neighbours, however, Kharkiv crushed the main uprising just two days later when Ukrainian forces stormed a security services building which the pro-Russians had seized. How it looked: The statue had been the focus of fierce arguments between nationalists and separatists . Sparks flying: The activists draped the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag from the plinth and used specialist tools . Mobbed: The statue is reportedly one of more than 100 which have been torn down in the last year in Ukraine . Around 70 separatists, some of whom were also accused of storming a TV station, were arrested. Since then there have been counter-protests by Ukrainian nationalists who insist on their city remaining under the control of the government in Kiev. They were demonstrating in the square last night when an order allowing the statue to be demolished was signed by Kharkiv's regional governor Ihor Baluta. Ukraine's interior minister Arsen Avakov, whose government has accused Russia of encouraging and supporting the rebels, celebrated the move. He insisted officials and the national guard were ready to combat 'provocateurs' who may seek to 'take advantage of the situation.' Battle: Kharkiv is just 25 miles from Ukraine's border with Russia, and was briefly overrun by gangs of pro-Russian separatists in April, but has avoided the intense fighting which has blighted Donetsk and Luhansk . Anton Gerashchenko, a senior advisor in Ukraine's Ministry of Interior Affairs, said the now-bare plinth should carry 'a monument to all the heroes who have fought and died for the independence and unity of Ukraine' But he added on Facebook: 'Lenin? Let him fall, only if people are not injured. Only if the bloody Communist idol's leaving does not add to the victims. 'Police gave the command to ensure the safety of people only, not the idol.' The statue had already been the focus of fierce arguments between separatists and nationalists, who said it was an outdated reference to Ukraine's time under the control of the Soviet Union. It has become one of more than 100 monuments to Lenin which have been toppled in the last year, according to the Kyiv Post. Citizens have voiced their anger against Russia by attacking monuments to Vladimir Lenin, a key architect of the Soviet Union who ruled from 1917 to 1924 and whose body is still on display in a mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square. Counter-protest: Pro-Russian activists held a lively demonstration around the monument at the end of March . Anton Gerashchenko, a senior advisor in Ukraine's Ministry of Interior Affairs, also celebrated the statue's fall on Facebook. He told his 68,000 followers the bare plinth should instead carry 'a monument to all the heroes who have fought and died for the independence and unity of Ukraine'. He added: 'It should be a monument for those who fought for independence a century ago, the hundreds gave their lives this winter, and all our soldiers defending their country in battle with Putin's Russia today. 'This has shown that Kharkiv is Ukraine! And always will be!'","Statue 28ft tall had stood in Kharkiv's Freedom Square for 50 years .

"Fair condition: Doctors still do not know what caused Teresa Heinz's seizure-like symptoms on Sunday . Teresa Heinz, the wife of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and heir to a ketchup company fortune, has been flown by private jet from Nantucket to Boston for further treatment after having a seizure while on holiday at her family's vacation home. Heinz was taken on a private plane to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on Sunday night after doctors at Nantucket Cottage Hospital stabilized her, a spokesman for Kerry said. The couple's spokesman said that her condition has improved and she has been upgraded from critical condition to 'fair' though she is still being kept under watch at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The secretary of state was with his 74-year-old wife as an ambulance first transported her from their $9.1million home to the island hospital, and also during her transfer to the Boston facility. The New York Times cited one unidentified insider who says that she suffered from some kind of seizure. 'The . family is grateful for the outpouring of support it has received and . aware of the interest in her condition, but they ask for privacy at this . time,' Mr Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson said in a statement. A hospital spokesman for the Nantucket . hospital, ranked as the number one hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report, said Heinz arrived in critical condition, although . doctors were able to stabilize her. Shortly . after 3:30 p.m. Sunday, emergency officials on Nantucket got a call . requesting medical aid at their $9.1million home on Hulbert Avenue and . dispatched an ambulance there, Nantucket Police Lt. Jerry Adams said. Boston, Massachusetts: State troopers stand guard outside Massachusetts General Hospital after Teresa Heinz, wife of Secretary of State John Kerry, was admitted . Heinz is the widow of former U.S. Senator John Heinz, and heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune. John Heinz died in April 1991 when a helicopter collided with a plane over a schoolyard in Merion, Pennsylvania. The senator was among seven people, including two children, who perished in the accident. She has never disclosed her full wealth- even during her second husband John's presidential campaign in 2004- but she is estimated to have a personal net worth of somewhere between $750million and $1.2billion. She and Kerry signed a prenuptial agreement before they got married in 1995 on Nantucket. Heinz, seen with Kerry when the election results came in during the 2004 election, is said to be very happy that he is the Secretary of State and is okay with him traveling much of the year . Rapid transportation: An ambulance carrying Heinz is followed by a limousine as it departs a runway access gate at Logan International Airport en route to Massachusetts General Hospital . Emergency flight: Heinz is transferred from the ambulance to a private jet at Nantucket Memorial Airport . Heinz, who for nine years went by Heinz-Kerry, removed the Kerry surname, both legally and officially, in 2004 after her husband . lost the presidential election . In December 2009, doctors treated her for breast cancer. Heinz previously has said she found in September 2009 that she had cancer in her left breast after having her annual mammogram. A month later, she underwent lumpectomies on both breasts at a Washington hospital after doctors also discovered what they thought was a benign growth on her right breast. That diagnosis was initially confirmed in postoperative pathology, but two other doctors later found it to be malignant. In November 2009, Heinz had another pair of lumpectomies performed at Massachusetts General Hospital. Power couple: John Kerry is pictured with his wife Teresa Heinz after being sworn-in as U.S. Secretary of State by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden during a ceremony at the State Department in Washington on February 6, 2013 . Previous treatment: Doctors treated her for breast cancer in December 2009 . Before Sunday's emergency, John Kerry had been at the Nantucket home since returning from a nearly two-week, around-the-world diplomatic trip to the Mideast and Southeast Asia in the pre-dawn hours of July 3. Before his wife's medical problem, he had planned to return to Washington on Monday and then co-host with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew high-level strategic and economic talks with senior Chinese officials on Wednesday and Thursday. Kerry had also spoken of his desire to make his sixth trip to Israel as secretary starting at the end of the week. State Department officials said Kerry's schedule may now change pending developments with his wife's health.","Teresa Heinz, 74, was on vacation with her husband at their $9.1m home when she reportedly had some kind of seizure .

"Apple's iPhone can already provide a soundtrack during your daily commute and distract you with a book, movie or game, but now the tech giant wants to make it easier for you to get where you're going. A US patent application submitted by Apple shows that the California-based company has been developing a new 'Commute Assistant' to give up-to-the minute travel information. The new service would appear as an app on Apple's devices to help commuters find the best way to make their journey by public transport. Apple's patent shows it has been developing an entirely new service dedicated to helping commuters. It wants to produce a one-stop app that will fulfill all of a users' commuting needs by providing a rolling list of bus and train travel times, routes, stops, route changes and delays . While there are already many third-party apps available for the iPhone, few seem to have the scope or ambition of Apple's proposed service. It wants to produce a one-stop app that will fulfill all of a users' commuting needs by providing a rolling list of bus and train travel times, routes, stops, route changes and delays. Apple has revealed plans to develop a new system that fires laser beams from its iPhones. But rather using it like a science fiction weapon, Apple wants to use the new feature to enable its phones to map their surroundings. The laser would be mounted inside the iPhone and used together with the inbuilt motion sensors to generate a map of any surface it is pointed at. An iPhone-mounted sensor  would detect any light bounced back to the device and provide information about the surfaces of objects around it. This  would allow the iPhone to be used to measure distance and create 3D maps of rooms and even buildings - something that currently requires bulky equipment. It could even be used in conjunction with 3D printers to create replicate a users favourite knickknack. For those with more exotic modes of transport in mind, the patent even mentions the service could include boats, airplanes and helicopters. Apple said it will pull together information from different transport networks in an area to provide up-to-the second information to calculate the quickest route. Users will be able to search for transport options using a map and their location, or by time, or a particular route. It proposes using a 'dynamic focus table', which provides a list of options that are updated as new information comes in, and changes as commuters move along their route. Apple claims it would be able to use information provided by transport companies themselves, information collected by third parties, and even data from sensors carried on board vehicles. The patent application said: 'The commute application provides a novel user interface that presents the routes and the schedules for the routes in an intuitive and fluid manner. 'For instance, the commute application of some embodiments includes several user interface widgets for facilitating the presentation of different routes that are part of different transit systems in a way that different route alternatives can be easily viewed. The patent suggests that the new app will send commuters alerts if a bus or train on their route is running late. Users will be able to search for transport options using a map and their location, or by time, or a particular route . Apple hopes its Commute Assistant will  help tourists by replacing the need for tube maps and bus timetables . Apple's patent will allow commuters to scroll through a route by time, showing where a service will stop . Commuters will be able to select a backup route to help them should there be problems on their chosen journey (illustrated) 'The commute application provides a dynamic focus table that dynamically presents schedules for trips along a particular route. 'For instance, when a particular route is selected to view its details, the dynamic focus table automatically presents the next upcoming trip along the particular route. 'In some embodiments, the dynamic focus table displays the next upcoming trip information based on the current time of the device and the location of the device. The dynamic focus table allows a user to quickly scroll though all the trips that are scheduled to travel along the a particular route throughout the day or for a certain period of time. 'In some embodiments the commute application receives updates to the arrival and departure time of transit vehicles at each stop along a route from a set of servers operated by a transit operators or from one or more third parties or from equipment that these parties install on the transit vehicles.' The patent, titled 'User Interface Tools for Commute Assistant', builds on Apple's Maps service that it provides on all its devices. It proposes using a 'dynamic focus table', which provides a list of options that are updated as new information comes in, and changes as commuters move along their route . Unlike Google's Maps service, it is not yet able to provide detailed transport network information. And Apple Maps has been previously criticised for not being as accurate as its rival. In the past few years Apple has acquired a number of firms that produce transportation apps, including HopStop, Locationary and Embark. Apple's patent includes options for saving a route, saving favourite locations and selecting a backup route for a trip. Users would also be able to check specific stops to see all the services that pass through it regardless of time and mode of transport. Apple also proposes to include information about internet access along a route and etiquette for boarding vehicles, where to stand on a platform and on escalators. It is also expected to be able to keep updating in the background, sending commuters notifications if a bus or train on their chosen route is running late.","US patent application shows Apple is developing a Commute Assistant .

"He’s making a list, and checking it twice, to find out who has been naughty and nice. But Santa might also want to jot down a few equations and sums, as he’ll need to grapple with the laws of physics come Christmas Eve. Of course, it’s unlikely Santa has to deal with the rules of science in quite the same way as regular people, but he might want to take a glance or two at the task awaiting him on his trip this year. Scroll down for video . Santa will have to overcome the laws of science when he makes his journey around the world from the North Pole on Christmas Eve (illustration of Santa and his reindeer shown). Calculations reveal the incredible speeds he will need to attain - 3,000 times the speed of sound . For starters, assuming that Santa doesn’t handle certain faiths, he’ll have about 378 million children to deliver to in a fairly short time frame, according to one scientist. Thankfully, due to the rotation of Earth he’ll have a good 31 hours to deliver presents - rather than just 24 - assuming he’s flying East to West to match Earth’s rotation. With a further assumption of their being 3.5 children in each household, based on the average census rate, that leaves him with 91.8 million homes to visit. That means he has 822.6 visits per second to cope with, requiring a stay of about one thousandth of a second to deliver presents to each home. American data storage company Seagate calculated the disk space required to back up Santa’s list. Based on the world population data for under-14s, taken from the U.S. Global Census, Seagate worked out Santa would receive an estimated 1,843,868,987 letters this year. If each Christmas letter takes up an estimated 500KB when uploaded as a scanned copy, it would take up 859GB of data each year. Letters from India's children would take up the most room with 338MB. China comes in second taking up 225MB and Nigeria sits in third place taking up 72MB. The UK comes in at number 32 on the list, taking up 10MB of data. All in all, Santa’s sleigh will need to move about 650 miles (1,050km) per second, which is 3,000 times the speed of sound or 0.35 per cent the speed of light. At such a speed it's possible Santa may start to feel the effects of relatiivty, particularly time dilation, causing him to age very slightly slower than the rest of the people on Earth - perhaps partially explaining his perpetual ability to deliver presents at Christmas. The sleigh will also have a sizable number of presents on board, further complicating matters. Is each child were to receive a present no more than 2lbs (0.9kg) in weight, the sleigh would still weigh more than 320,000 tons - just shy of the weight of the Empire State Building, 370,000 tons. An average reindeer on Earth can pull only 300 pounds (135kg), so in this scenario 214,200 reindeer would be needed. Of course, considering these are flying reindeer, they may well be able to handle heavier loads. But with the weight and speed of the sleigh, it appears that the front two reindeer - Dasher and Dancer, until Rudolph’s inclusion - will be subjected to 13.4 quintillion joules of energy per second. This will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight. The entire reindeer team, assuming only eight are used, would be vapourised in 4.26 thousandths of a second. With the weight and speed of the sleigh, it appears that the front two reindeer - Dasher and Dancer, will be subjected to 13.4 quintillion joules of energy per second. This would generate temperatures far in excess of those experienced by Nasa's Orion on its return to Earth Friday 5 December (illustration shown) However, in rebuttals to Miss Harden’s research, other scientists pointed out a few points that might make his job a bit easier. Jim Mantle from Waterloo Maple Software suggested that Santa wouldn’t necessarily have to visit all 91.8 million homes in one night. ‘Santa would have to Fedex a number of packages ahead of time, since he would not be able to fly into Air Force Bases, or into tower-controlled areas near airports,’ he explained, so those homes could be subtracted. And another unnamed scienist said that such flying reindeer might have more power than we think owing to a ‘dominant gene sequence within the reindeer DNA strand.’ Meanwhile, last year a team of scientists from The Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair said Santa would 150 billion calories in milk and mince pies during his journey, if he accepted all the snacks on offer at various homes. And the total expenditure on all of the presented needed would be around £280 billlion ($440 billion) - which is £30 billion ($47 billion) more than his home country of Finland. Spare a thought for the elves as well; 3,000 of them need to work eight hours a day around the clock, for the whole year, in order to get enough presents for every good child. So however Santa Claus plans to get all his presents delivered this year, we hope he’s taken a look at the science accordingly. Thankfully, due to the rotation of Earth he’ll have a good 31 hours to deliver presents - rather than just 24 - assuming he’s flying East to West to match Earth’s rotation. Shown is an illustration from Nats blog, which shows the possible path taken by Santa around Europe .","Santa will have to overcome the laws of science when he makes his journey around the world from the North Pole on Christmas Eve .

"Interns usually spend their time making tea and running errands - but not the interns at Nasa. With the excitement of Orion's 'picture perfect' test flight out of the way, the space agency's work experience team seem to have found themselves at a loose end. So, what better way to fill the time than to create parody of Meghan Trainor's number one single, All About That Bass? Scroll down for video . With the excitement of Orion's 'picture perfect' test flight out of the way, the space agency's work experience team decided to create parody of Meghan Trainor's number one single, All About That Bass? The resulting video is a mix of pop-style dance moves, cringeworthy lyrics and shots of the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, which helped launch the Orion spacecraft a week ago. 'Hey, they're working so hard, don't you love these Nasa guys?/They will take us so far the first time that Orion flies/You know we travelling' to deep destinations 'fore too long,' they lyrics say. Orion captured the world's attention when it orbited the Earth twice, in an effort to test systems that could one day take humans to Mars. But excitement around the Nasa launch has since faded. To rekindle interest, the Johnson Space Centre tasked its interns with creating a viral video dubbed All About that Space. The resulting video is a mix of pop-style dance moves cringe-worthy lyrics and shots of the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, which launched the Orion spacecraft a week ago . Last week, for the first time in nearly half a century, Nasa launched a spaceship designed to carry astronauts far beyond Earth. Riding atop a fountain of fire, the 24-story-tall Orion spacecraft soared above the Atlantic Ocean on the 5th of December, punching through partly cloudy skies. The unmanned craft was then catapulted around the Earth twice in a 4.5-hour journey, before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,000 km/h). In the future, Nasa hopes to use the spacecraft to send astronauts to an asteroid in the 2020s and ultimately take them to Mars in the 2030s. The lyrics, written by Sarah Schlieder, talk about how the space agency is attempting to complete project like the Apollo mission that took humans to the Moon in 1969. 'I'm bringing rockets back/ Go ahead and tell the whole world that/ We're doing exploration. Come on, board it stat/ We're ready for liftoff,' the interns sing. Trainor's single, All About that Bass was one of the fastest selling singles of the year, and held the number one spot longer than any other song in 2014. This isn't the first time Nasa-fans have turned to music to convey their enthusiasm for space. In 2012, a parody clip on LMFAO's party anthem Sexy and I Know It, space enthusiasts talked about celebrated the Nasa Curiosity mission. With lyrics like 'We're better than SpaceX and we ain't afraid to show it,' the video became an instant hit. The Curiosity Rover even tweeted: 'This fan-made video is awesome (and I know it),' adding the mission hashtag #MSL and #wigglewigglewiggle.

The couple had been dating about a year before they got engaged. Smiling after tragedy: Miss Scruggs showed off her prosthetic hand during an interview with Dateline on NBC in November 2012 . Sharing her struggle: The Texan revealed part of her prosthetic arm during her TV interview in which she promoted her memoir, Still Lolo . The pair first met in December 2012 after  Rancic interviewed Ms Scruggs for E! News following her recovery from her accident.

"The satisfaction for trainer Willie Mullins of leaving Fairyhouse yesterday with two more Cheltenham Festival favourites in his armoury was extinguished by two massive blows. Ireland’s champion trainer lost hugely promising Allez Colombieres. The French import had to be put down after suffering a pelvic injury in the Grade One Royal Bond Hurdle.

Allez Colombieres, another recruit from across the Channel, had been favourite for the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle on reputation alone but his Irish debut in a race won by stablemate Nichols Canyon lasted only two jumps before being pulled up by Ruby Walsh. Mullins said a fracture in the sacroiliac region of his pelvis had cut the iliac artery causing internal bleeding. The setbacks came as French import Kalkir was promoted to 5-1 favourite for the Triumph Hurdle after a smooth eight-length in the Grade Three Juvenile Hurdle under Walsh while Valseur Lido heads of the betting at 5-1 for the JLT Novices’ Chase after his impressive eight-length success in a highly competitive Grade One Drinmore Novices’ Chase under Bryan Cooper.

"A man who punched a hole through an £8million Claude Monet painting has been jailed for six years and banned from all galleries - despite claiming he collapsed onto it due to a heart condition. Andrew Shannon strolled calmly into the  National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin before attacking the 1874 work Argenteuil Basin with a Single Sail Boat, which was left needing two years of repairs. The 49-year-old, who later underwent a quadruple heart bypass, denied deliberately tearing the painting and told police he had felt dizzy and lost his balance. Destroyed: Andrew Shannon, 49, left a huge hole in  Monet's Argenteuil Basin with a Single Sail Boat (1874) Evidence: The jury saw CCTV which showed Shannon raising his arm just before the painting was ruined . But a witness told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court his movement was a 'lunge' and Shannon's fist had gone straight through the painting like a 'hammer'. And the court heard Shannon had 48 previous convictions, including for handling stolen maps worth £5,000 which dated to 1651. A jury of seven woman and five men was told how Shannon walked into the gallery just before 11am on June 29, 2012. He walked over to the Monet painting to look at it before disappearing, coming back and launching the attack - which was captured on CCTV. Instead of his clenched hand falling low on the painting, it made contact above his eyeline - meaning he would have had to raise his arm, the court heard. Security staff and two horrified tourists from New Zealand helped call an ambulance after Shannon told them he had unstable angina. Jailed: Shannon (pictured) told police he had unstable angina and later underwent a quadruple heart bypass - but a jury found him guilty of damaging the painting after an eight-day trial at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court . He was treated by a paramedic who administered a glyceryl trinitrate spray and aspirin. Despite the medical crew finding he was in a safe condition, he was taken to hospital where he was released the same day and interviewed by police. During the interview he told officers he had a heart condition and had done nothing wrong. But tourist Michael  Williams told the eight-day trial he had seen a man with a clenched fist put it straight into the Monet. He said he grabbed the man, who said something like he felt faint, and moved him into the middle of the room to get him away from the paintings. Mr Williams' wife Toni Ashton added she was standing beside her husband when she saw an arm appear and a fist go through the Monet. She said it was like a 'hammer' and described the movement as a lunge. Restored: The painting has since been returned to its original state - but many fragments were lost forever . Good as new: Experts point out the meticulous work on the painting, likened to microscopic needlework . Police also found a tin of paint stripper in Mr Shannon’s bag - but the judge later concluded it was for his job as a French polisher. Consultant surgeon Nicholas Walcot told the court that in July 2013, after he had been in prison for almost a year, Mr Shannon underwent a quadruple heart bypass because he had a 90 per cent blockage in three vessels of the heart. But the surgeon said he would expect only one in 100 people with the condition to have dizzy spells, and if he fell down he would normally have remained unconscious rather than getting up. Judge Martin Nolan, who directed the jury to find Shannon not guilty of damaging two more paintings at Dublin's Shelbourne hotel, said the 49-year-old must have known the painting was valuable. He added it was a 'peculiar crime' and it was 'abnormal' for Shannon to cause as much damage as he did. He sentenced him to six years' jail and suspended the final 15 months on strict conditions - including that Shannon not enter into a public painting gallery or any other building where paintings are publicly displayed. The maximum sentence for the offence, to which Shannon pleaded not guilty, was ten years. Masterpiece: Painted in 1874 when Monet was working from a boat on the Seine, Argenteuil Basin with a Single Sail Boat is the only work by the renowned Impressionist which is in the Irish national art collection . A previous jury in the case had been discharged last December after failing to reach a verdict. The artwork was ripped apart in a devastating three-branch tear and was finally restored this year following a painstaking 18-month restoration. Laid end to end, the tears would have been about a foot long in an artwork less than four feet square. Conservationists removed the painting from its frame and delicately sewed together thousands of fine threads which made up the canvas. Seven per cent of the pieces of the Monet - the only work by the artist in Ireland's national collection - could not be saved, some splitting into powdery dust. Sean Rainbird, director of the National Gallery of Ireland, likened the meticulous repair to microscopic needlework. 'It was huge damage, shocking damage,' he said. 'This project to restore and conserve one of the gallery's most popular impressionist works of art is testament to the outstanding expertise and dedication of our professional team of conservators.' The 55cm by 65cm oil painting, created when Monet used a boat as a floating studio on the  Seine, is now behind protective glass with ultraviolet filtering and humidity controls.","Andrew Shannon, 49, ripped Monet's Argenteuil Basin (1874) in attack .

"Conservative grassroots organizations are seething today over the inclusion in a government spending bill of a campaign finance measure that will allow wealthy Americans to give more money to political parties. Concerned that the measure will have the practical effect of redirecting funds away from their groups to the national party, Tea Party organizers denounced the $1.1 trillion spending bill that narrowly passed the House on Thursday evening and GOP leadership in Congress. While Republicans are traditionally in favor of removing caps on political donations, the rider has conservatives that are normally in favor of the free flow of money aligned with progressive groups that seek to limit it. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night: A visibly elated John Boehner walks to the House chamber on Thursday night for a vote on the $1.1 trillion spending package to keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year. The House is headed home for the holidays now that it passed the all-important legislation . At issue is a measure in the gargantuan appropriations legislation that would raise the amount that individual donors can give to the national parties from $32,400 a year to $324,000 a year. The provision calls from the party committees to create three separate accounts to which individual donors can give up to $97,200 a year. One fund would go toward building costs for the Washington, D.C. based organizations. Another would be allotted to costs for the presidential nominating conventions. The third would go toward general expenses. Right-wing groups have long argued that the government should not be able to regulate how much money its citizens are allowed to give to political causes and that political donations are a form of free speech covered by the First Amendment. On the liberal end of the spectrum, progressives consistently bemoan the influence of big spenders on the political process and have supported greater restrictions on political spending by individuals and corporations. But the changes to political giving for establishment groups has Tea Partiers up in arms this week out of fear that it will hurt their fundraising efforts and weaken their ability to hold the Republican Party accountable. 'What congressional leaders are doing is what they do best: protecting incumbents and the two-party system. The omnibus rider will only strengthen the Washington establishment in both parties and not create a level playing field for candidates who are outside the Beltway,' Citizens United President David Bossie said in a statement on Thursday. Citizens United is notably the group that fought and prevailed against the Federal Elections Commission in 2010 at the Supreme Court over the amount of money that nonprofit organizations could put toward independent political expenditures. The landmark decision opened the floodgates to so-called dark money in politics, its critics charge. Individual donors may give only $5,000 a year to Political Action Committees, PACs, under FEC rules, however, they're allowed to write blank checks to Super PACs that do not have to disclose their deep-pocketed donors. The nifty accounting measure has created an avenue for wealthy Americans to leave their mark on politics and given Tea Party endorsed candidates an edge at times over their establishment competitors. 'Conservatives support the First Amendment and believe there should be no limits on political speech,' Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, told Politico on Thursday. 'Unfortunately, the new limits included in the omnibus only increase political speech for party insiders while silencing the majority of Americans who are fed up with Washington,' he said. Senate Conservatives Fund President Ken Cuccinelli, left, and conservative commentator Mark Levin are pictured here at a Constitution Day rally in September of 2013 during Cuccinelli's bid for the Virginia governor's mansion. The two men are hopping mad this week over a provision in the omnibus bill that would effectively direct money away from outside spending groups and toward the national political parties . Changed Times: Citizens United President David Bossie, right, meets with reporters outside  the Supreme Court  on Jan. 21, 2010, after the high court ruled in the organization's favor on a campaign finance reform case. The decision allowed the group to spend its money on independent political expenditures. Now Citizens United is railing against a GOP-supported campaign finance measure . The House-originated 1,600 page joint omnibus bill and continuing resolution that contained the offending provision would fund the government through Sept. 30, 2015. The provision of the extensive spending legislation affecting political donations made unlikely allies of progressives and conservatives this week as they simultaneously tried to convince their respective voting blocs on Capitol Hill to demand the measure be removed. It advanced to the Senate on Thursday, despite objections from both sides of the political aisle, after a day of rancor on Capitol Hill that pitted conservatives against House Speaker John Boehner and Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, against President Barack Obama. The House on Thursday night passed a joint continuing resolution and omnibus that would fund the federal government through next fiscal year, with the exception of Homeland Security, which it only appropriates money to until the end of February. The legislation is now under review in the Senate, and the upper chamber's leader has said he hopes to pass the appropriations package today. The White House said Thursday that the president would sign the bill if it came to his desk, and the president and his team spent the rest of the day lobbying Democrats to vote yes on the measure. In the meantime the president signed a resolution keeping the government open through Saturday, giving the Senate more time to pass the long-term legislation. Hard-right lawmakers refused to vote for the long-term appropriations bill after House leadership rejected their request to include language effectively defunding Obama's immigration orders. Republican leaders instead limited Homeland Security funding to the first two months of the year and promised conservatives an opportunity to revisit the the topic when the department's funding runs out. At that point Republicans elected in November will have taken their seats in Congress, giving the GOP full control over the legislative branch. Staunch conservatives wouldn't get on board with the plan, however, arguing that the omnibus bill offers better leverage than legislation to fund DHS. Pelosi and many members of her caucus threatened to withhold their votes as well over a measure Democratic groups believe is a sweetheart deal for Wall Street and the dramatic reforms to campaign finance rules. 'The last thing the American people want is for Congress to give big donors even more influence in politics, but that's exactly what this provision will do,' Nick Nyhart, president of progressive group Public Campaign, said in a statement on Tuesday. 'The biggest donors will be able to buy more access and influence and everyone else back home will continue wondering who their elected officials are working for,' he said. After some last-minute finagling by the president, who came out in favor of the bill on Thursday, as it included funding for several of the administration's key initiatives, the bill made it through the House and into the Senate with just hours to spare. The Senate still has to debate and pass the legislation and the president must then sign it, but a government shutdown was staved off when the president signed a resolution extending government funding through Saturday. Today the upper chamber is expected to sign the bill, allowing lawmakers to close the chapter on the current legislative session. Even though the legislation was authored in and first passed in the House, conservatives have focused their ire on soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who they unsuccessfully tried to unseat earlier when he came up for reelection. Conservative raid host Mark Levin called the rider on Wednesday an 'outrage among many outrages' in the bill and derided McConnell as 'power hungry.' 'Do you know why he’s doing that? It’s to destroy any conservative any group that seeks to challenge an incumbent, to destroy the entire primary process,' Levin charged. 'That’s what McConnell is up to.' As McConnell's office pointed out to Politico, however, the Senate leader had little influence over the House bill that was intended to be a compromise between Republicans and Democrats in the House.","They're concerned the measure will have the practical effect of redirecting funds away from their groups to the national party .
The rider has conservatives that are normally in favor of the free flow of money aligned with progressive groups that seek to limit it .

"Ijaz, a bus conductor in his early twenties, spends his days travelling through the bustling streets of Peshawar in northern Pakistan, working hard to scrape a living. The pay is low and the hours are long, and Ijaz, like many of his colleagues, remains unwed and has no family. Instead of going home come nightfall, he, and many others, spend their time with street children, paying them as little as 75p for sex and when they have no money, brutally abusing them. Scroll down for video . At risk: Of Pakistan's 1.5 million street children, an estimated 90 per cent have been sexually abused . But the children falling prey to these men aren't the ones you might expect. With girls kept at home by their parents, the majority of victims are boys - some as young as six years old. 'Once, there was a boy on the bus and everyone had sex with him,' confesses Ijaz who admits to raping 12 different children during his career as a bus conductor. 'I did it too but what else could I do? They invited me. And he was that kind of boy anyway.' Sexual abuse in Pakistan is rife. An estimated four million children in the country are forced into work from an early age due to poverty and of those, more than a million live on the streets where they are easy prey for men like Ijaz. A recent survey of 1,800 men found that a third believe that not only is raping little boys not a crime, it's not even a bad thing to do. As a result, an estimated 90 per cent of street children have been victims of sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Damaged: Naeem, 13, has been on the streets, off and on, . since running away from his violent brother who repeatedly beat him . following their parents' death. He was eight at the time . Dangerous: Most of the street children are little boys and 90 per cent fall victim to paedophiles . One such boy is Naeem, 13, who has been on the streets, off and on, since running away from his violent brother who repeatedly beat him following their parents' death. He was eight at the time. His world is one of drugs and violence. He talks casually of a street where you'll find 'all the paedos'. He is addicted to heroin and regularly abuses his own fragile body, cutting and stabbing himself in an attempt to deal with his anger. Although he has sold himself to pay for drugs, he also tells, with tears in his eyes, of a time when he was attacked by a gang of men. 'I was lying here sleeping and four people grabbed me and threw me into a . car,' he sobs. 'One was a bus driver, the others were heroin addicts. All four of . them raped me.' Many of Pakistan's abusers are bus drivers. One man who knows this all too well is Hassan Deen, an entrepreneur who rents beds - and sometimes boys - to drivers at Peshawar's largest bus depot. 'A bus driver . rents a bed from me and he says he'll pay an extra 50 (50p) or 100 rupees (£1) if I . can get him a boy,' explains Mr Deen. 'There's often a kid wandering the streets alone. We . tell these boys we'll provide food and shelter if they come with us. That's how we lure them in.' Others, addicted to the cheap heroin that pours across the border from neighbouring Afghanistan, will have sex with these men for a price. 'If . I don't make enough money picking trash, I sell my body,' admits Naeen. 'The first time . I sold myself, I didn't have any money. 'So I did it three times with a . man and in return, he gave me 3,000 rupees (£17). I was . eight and a half. I was little. 'The . first time I did it, I hadn't eaten for two to three days. Afterwards, I . cried all night, asking myself, ""What have I done?"" I did this to . myself to make some money.' Hotspot: Peshawar's bus depots are the scene of much of the abuse with bus drivers being the main culprits . Drugs: Thanks to the proximity of Afghanistan and its cheap heroin, drug addiction is rife among street boys . And Naeen isn't alone. Another street child, nine-year-old Akeeb has also been approached by men on the street but has so far managed to escape. 'I don't get scared if I have a friend . with me,' he says. 'I get bothered a lot by the bus driver, the van driver. They tell me to climb on the roof of the bus and do bad . things with them. Sometimes they offer me a soft drink in return.' Unsurprisingly, the impact of this abuse on the children is severe. Along with psychological problems, a Save the Children report showed that as many as one in 10 are murdered by the men who abuse them. Others go on to become abusers themselves, among them 13-year-old Naeem. 'There was a boy, . about 10 or 11,' he confesses, shame-faced. Chaos: The busy streets of Peshawar are also home to thousands of children - and some dangerous men . Hoping to help: Imran Khan describes the plight of the street children as 'shameful' for Pakistani society . 'I took him to the cinema and spent money on him and he . was OK with it. But when we left the cinema, he said he didn't want to . do it anymore so then I grabbed his hand and forced him.' Although there are laws in place to protect children, police rarely bother themselves with the plight of the street children, with many saying that the ever-present threat of Taliban bombs trumps saving small boys. One man who might be able to help is politician Imran Khan. 'It's one of the most sad and shameful . aspects of our society,' he says. 'I'm totally embarrassed by this. It's really shameful for us that we have not been able to protect them.' For now, boys like Naeem continue to fall victim to predatory paedophiles like serial rapist Ijaz, a man who claims to want a 'good woman' for a wife one day and children of his own. 'I'm . going to look for a good wife who's read the Quran and prays,' he says. 'A good, . respectable woman. Religion is very important because I'm . Muslim.' That, however, hasn't stopped him from attacking boys. 'What can we do?,' he whines. 'We know it's totally . against Islam. God doesn't like it. But we're helpless against our . desire.'

"A former University of Pittsburgh researcher convicted last month of poisoning his neurologist wife with cyanide wants a judge to unfreeze his assets so he can pay his legal bills and establish a trust fund for their 7-year-old daughter. Attorneys for Robert Ferrante, 66, argued in a court filing Tuesday that a previous court order freezing his assets is violating his rights to fund his defense, and merely preserving the money so his wife's family, and its attorney, have assets to go after in a wrongful death suit. John Gismondi, who represents Dr. Autumn Klein's mother in that lawsuit, said he doesn't necessarily oppose a trust fund, since any money won in the suit would go to Ferrante and Klein's daughter, Cianna. Pittsburgh scientist Robert Ferrante (left), 66, who faces a life sentence in the fatal poisoning of his wife, Autumn Klein (right), wants his assets unfrozen so he could start a trust fund for their daughter . Guilty as sin: Dr Klein, pictured here during his trial, was convicted last month of first-degree murder . Lois and William Klein, Autumn Ferrante's parents, have been raising Cianna in Maryland from the time of her mother's death, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. But he objects to Ferrante's request that the trust be administered by Ferrante's adult son from a previous marriage, Michael Ferrante, a financial planner who lives with his newlywed wife in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Family feud: The couple's 7-year-old daughter, pictured here with Mrs Klein, is now in the care of her maternal grandparents, who do not want Ferrante's son to administer the trust fund . 'He shouldn't be the one determining what terms of a trust may be acceptable to her,' Gismondi said, referring to Ferrante. 'This seems to be an attempt by him to try to exert control from his jail cell.' But Ferrante's attorneys contend that, 'No authority, statutory or otherwise, permits the commonwealth to freeze defendant's assets in order to ensure that Lois Klein's personal injury attorney, John Gismondi, can recover a fee of several hundred thousand dollars.' Attorneys in wrongful death lawsuits typically receive anywhere from 25 to 40 per cent of any monetary verdict. Ferrante remains in the Allegheny County jail without bond until he is sentenced on February 4. Because he was convicted of first-degree murder in Autumn Klein's April 2013 death, he faces a mandatory life sentence without parole. Ferrante previously was given court permission to use some assets for his criminal defense, and it's not clear how much he has spent. Defense attorney William Difenderfer has suggested Ferrante has little remaining wealth to go after. But apart from the wrongful death litigation, the Allegheny County district attorney's office filed a motion asking a judge to require that Ferrante account for his assets. The DA is doing that because prosecutors may seek restitution as part of Ferrante's sentence, and because records indicate Ferrante has transferred some assets to his two adult children from his first marriage. Testimony at trial indicated Ferrante had assets worth at least $2.5million. Ferrante denied poisoning Klein and disputed whether that cyanide caused her death at all . The jury found that Robert Ferrante ordered cyanide using a university-issued charge card and laced an energy drink he gave Klein, 41. Text messages from the night Klein fell ill show Ferrante suggested the drink would help Klein conceive another child, which her family and friends said Klein desperately sought. She died three days later. Ferrante denied poisoning Klein and disputed whether that caused her death at all. He testified he ordered the cyanide because it could be used in stem cell research related to his work involving Lou Gehrig's disease.","A jury in November found former University of Pittsburgh researcher Robert Ferrante, 66, guilty of killing his wife, Autumn Klein .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has admitted that people's internet search histories and data will also be used to fight crime in Australia - not just for anti-terrorism purposes. Mr Abbott has revealed that the government has opened discussions with Internet Service Providers around the country to ensure that the 'Big Brother' policy can be put in place, seeking measures to ensure the digital footprint of all Australians is not lost. 'This is an absolutely vital weapon in the fight against terror and an absolutely vital weapon against crime fighting more generally,' Mr Abbott said. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott says 'expert advice' has been provided to the government to ensure metadata storage should be used for all crime-fighting . 'An absolutely vital weapon against crime fighting' Tony Abbott . The controversial plan to hold on to phone and internet records of all Australians was originally flagged only as part of a suite of dramatic new anti-terror laws announced by the government. Despite the admission it's now likely to have wider use by authorities, the PM would not be drawn on whether the information kept would be secure. 'It's not what you are doing on the internet, it's the site's you are visiting, it's not the content it's just where you have been. 'It's the person you are sending it to, the person sending it, it's the date and the place it's posted from.' Metadata is the information kept by . telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers, email addresses . and the dates, times, locations and duration of phone calls. Government officials have begun seeking guarantees from the providers that those details of browsing history will be not be lost. 'There is some risk, as time goes by, that this information will no longer be kept,' added Mr Abbott. The plan would require bi-partisan support. The Prime Minister is now fighting the announcement on two fronts - including claims the Coalition is no better than the former Gillard Labor Government in breaking election promises. Mr Abbott said the about-face on the Racial Discrimination Act was about winning back support from ethnic communities and that the stronger anti-terror laws were now a more pressing issue. But civil liberties groups claim the government's plans are nothing more than 'a smokescreen'. Terry O'Gorman from the Australian Council of Civil Liberties said that 'this is just propaganda spin by the Prime Minister talking up this problem (terrorist sympathisers)'. 'It's an illogical announcement, nothing more than a deliberate and serious exaggeration,' Mr O'Gorman said. 'There are already sufficient laws in place to deal with anyone caught dealing with extremists and as for metadata being used in ordinary criminal investigations, well this information is already accessible to authorities, without a warrant being required. 'All these so-called announcements have been nothing more than a smokescreen, over their getting rid of the so-called Bolt laws.'","Data storage will not be reserved for anti-terror purposes .

"White households are more likely to own stocks, which increases their wealth (stock photo) The economic recovery has not been equal among the races, according to a Pew Research Center study released today. The study found that the wealth gap between white households and minorities has widened in recent years. The wealth of white households was 13 times greater than that of black households in 2013, versus eight times the wealth in 2010. The wealth of white households was more than 10 times that of Hispanic households, up from nine times the wealth in 2010. Pew researchers — analyzing data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances— found that the gap between whites and blacks has reached its highest point since 1989. The wealth ratio for whites-to-Hispanics is at a level not seen since 2001. Net worth is a measure of the difference between the household's assets and their liabilities. The typical household had a net worth of $81,400 in 2013, according to the Fed's survey. The recession was universally hard on American families as a stock market crash and plunging house prices ate into their net worth. From 2007 to 2010, the median net worth of American families fell 39 percent. Researchers say a number of factors may be responsible for the uneven recovery: falling income, lower savings rate and different asset holdings. The median income in minority households fell 9 percent from 2010 and 2013, versus a 1 percent drop in white households. In turn, researchers say, minority households may have either been forced to draw down from savings to get by or were unable to replenish their savings as much as white households. Additionally, certain financial assets, such as stocks, recovered more quickly than housing since the recession ended. White households are also more likely than minorities to own stocks, putting them in a better position for a recovery. The wealth of white households was 13 times greater than that of black households in 2013 (graph shows the disparity)","The wealth of white households was 13 times greater than that of black households in 2013, versus eight times the wealth in 2010 .

"Take the FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, add the most talented British player of his generation in Gareth Bale, throw in the top scorer from the last World Cup, James Rodriguez, and the goalkeeper who made the most saves last season in La Liga in Keylor Navas, add the world football's most affable manager Carlo Ancelotti and what have you got? Possibly the £530million super team that will dominate European football for the next five years. Real Madrid's transformation into the team everyone wants to watch has even got Johan Cruyff twitching. Speaking in Spain this week the former Barcelona player and European Cup-winning manager gave his verdict on Real's summer signings and it made depressing reading for the rest of Europe. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cristiano Ronaldo smash one in off the bar during training . Galacticos: Real Madrid have a team of superstars who look set to dominate European football for the next five years, with players such as (from left to right) Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Cristiano Ronaldo . Stars: Ronaldo (left) and Bale (right) will be on show against Sevilla in the Super Cup in Cardiff on Tuesday . Envy: Real boss Carlo Ancelotti has a squad any other manager would dream of - with an average age of just 25 . Glory: Real won the Champions League last season and will look to be the first team to defend it this campaign . '(Toni) Kroos was one the best players at Bayern and for Germany in the World Cup,' he said. 'He moves the ball about very well and James Rodriguez is a really top-class ball-player. Madrid have so much quality in midfield and up-front. Barca used to sign the ball-players, now it's Madrid.' The praise from Cruyff and the sight of the ball a blur in the 'rondo' passing drills at Madrid's Valdebebas training ground – something that was once Barcelona's trademark – is a reminder that Real went to another level last season and are threatening to go to yet another level this season. Jose Mourinho had made them the best counter-attacking team in world football and Ancelotti has maintained that element to their play with the £86million introduction of Bale last season making them even more lethal on the counter-attack. But with the introduction of Isco last season and the growing influence of Luka Modric, a short passing game was added to the cut-throat forays forward. Madrid could mix it up. Now with Rodriguez and Kroos they can really mix it up. Rival: Barcelona legend Johan Cruyff has commented positively on Real's recruitment and playing style . Sharp shooter: Bale practises free kicks watched by Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti . Star appeal: Real Madrid's Bale (left),  Kroos (centre) and Rodriguez train in Cardiff . On the run: Kroos (left) and Bale train with their team-mates at Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . Stopper: Real signed Keylor Navas this summer and the average age of their starting line-up is just 25 . VIDEO Ancelotti aware of expectation . The upshot is that sides facing the European champions are at a loss as to how to play them. Play a high line and the ball over the top to Ronaldo and Bale destroys them as Bayern Munich found out last season. Let them have the ball and play in front of you and with Modric now supported by Rodriguez and Kroos they can play passes through the gaps. And they can also shoot from distance, which gives them something even the brilliant Barca team that won 14 trophies in four years under Pep Guardiola did not have. There were times when that Barca side floundered against a 10-man defence and would rely on a long shot for the breakthrough. Occasionally it came, from Andres Iniesta at Stamford Bridge in 2009, but often it didn't. This Madrid side scored more goals from outside the area than any team in Spain last season and with Kroos and Rodriguez added that is not about to change. It's not the first time Madrid have tried to buy every world-class player on the planet but the last time it ended in tears as egos clashed and players were brought in with no thought given to how they might play together. Local hero: Madrid's Welsh forward Bale at Cardiff City Stadium on Monday ahead of the Super Cup . Waiting in the wings: Real legend Zinedine Zidane is likely to take over from Ancelotti in the future . Next in line: Sergio Ramos is likely to be named the next permanent Real captain if Iker Casillas leaves . Sir Alex Ferguson dubbed that crop the Harlem Globetrotters because there was more exhibition than silverware. If last year's Spanish and European Cup double are any indication there is a winning mentality to this team that will not be satisfied by thrilling failure. Winning all six trophies this season is the aim and they can also become the first side to win back-to-back Champions Leagues. The frightening thing for their rivals is that the age of the players likely to line-up for the big games this season (Navas 27, Carvajal 22, Varane 21, Ramos 28, Marcelo 26, Kroos 24, Rodriguez 23, Modric 28, Bale 25, Benzema 26, Ronaldo 29) is just 25. And when  Ancelotti does decide to step aside Zinedine Zidane will be ready to step-up from the B-team. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"The US Navy has revealed its latest recruit - a giant robotic spy disguised as a tuna. The robo-fish is designed to swim into enemy territory, and to guard the hulls of US boats. It uses a robo-fin to move silently through the water - and had been dubbed 'Silent Nemo' by Navy bosses. Scroll down for video . Silent Nemo in action: The robo-fish device is designed to look like a tuna in the water .It swims just like a fish does by oscillating its robotic tail fin back and forth. The unmanned underwater vehicle is able to make tight turns and move through the water quietly, making it ideal for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. At a length of approximately 5 feet and a weight of nearly 100 pounds, the GhostSwimmer vehicle can operate in water depths ranging from 10 inches to 300 feet. The 5-foot, 100-pound armature was modeled after a bluefin tuna and uses a rear caudle fin to move through the water just like the fish. It swims just like a fish does by oscillating its tail fin back and forth, leading to its nickname of Nemo (below) The robot is capable of operating autonomously for extended periods of time due to its long-lasting battery, but it can also be controlled via laptop with a 500-foot tether. Researchers from the Chief of Naval Operations Rapid Innovation Cell and Boston Engineering tested the prototype at the Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek in Virginia on Thursday. The fish can be controlled with a joystick or be programmed to swim on its own. The unmanned underwater vehicle is able to make tight turns and move through the water quietly, making it ideal for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The Navy hopes it could be used to inspect the hull of a ship, check waters for threats such as mines or protrusions, deliver payloads including sonar and guidance packages, and access otherwise denied areas. Over the past several weeks, Boston Engineering's tuna-sized device, also known as Ghost Swimmer, has been gathering data on tides, varied currents, wakes, and weather conditions for the development of future tasks. 'GhostSwimmer will allow the Navy to have success during more types of missions while keeping divers and Sailors safe,' said Michael Rufo, director of Boston Engineering's Advanced Systems Group. The GhostSwimmer was developed to resemble the shape and mimic the swimming style of a large fish. At a length of approximately 5 feet and a weight of nearly 100 pounds, the GhostSwimmer vehicle can operate in water depths ranging from 10 inches to 300 feet. 'It swims just like a fish does by oscillating its tail fin back and forth,' said Rufo. 'The unit is a combination of unmanned systems engineering and unique propulsion and control capabilities.' Its bio-mimicry provides additional security during low visibility intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and friendly hull inspections, while quieter than propeller driven craft of the same size, according to Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC). The robot is capable of operating autonomously for extended periods of time due to its long-lasting battery, but it can also be controlled via laptop with a 500-foot tether. A Ghost Swimmer, a biomimetic device modeled after the blue fin tuna, rest on a dock at the Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story. The tether is long enough to transmit information while inspecting a ship's hull, for example, but if operating independently (without a tether) the robot will have to periodically be brought to the surface to download its data. 'This project and others that we are working on at the CRIC are important because we are harnessing the brainpower and talents of junior Sailors,' said Capt. Jim Loper, department head for Concepts and Innovation, NWDC. 'The opportunity for a young Sailor who has a good idea to get that idea heard, and to get it turned into action, is greater [now] than any other time in our Navy's history.' Capt. Jim Loper, head of the concepts and innovation department at the Navy Warfare Development Command in Norfolk, told the Virginian Pilot it could become operational as soon as next year. Mike Conry, a mechanical engineer with Boston Engineering, left, steers the Ghost Swimmer, as his colleagues Dave Shane, center, and Robert Watson, right, look on during a demonstration of the biomimetic device model at the Joint Expeditionary Base . He's behind you! Operators test the robo-fish . 'The idea is to take millions of years of evolution,' said the project's manager, Marine Corps Capt. Jerry Lademan. 'This fish has perfected itself by swimming around the water for millenia, so what we are trying to do with this project, the idea of biomimicry, is to reverse engineer what nature has already done to optimize design for us.It looks alive.' Loper and Michael Rufo, director of the advanced systems group at Boston Engineering, which specializes in unmanned systems and robotics, said it would take only months to complete the technology for Nemo to swim on its own. Rufo said the fish's combination of 'efficiency, maneuverability and speed' make it relevant for naval operations. While no weaponry has been developed for Nemo, Loper said the full scope of applications hasn't been exhausted. 'Let your imagination run wild,' he said. Silent Nemo swims just like a fish does by oscillating its robotic tail fin back and forth.","Designed to swim into enemy territory, and to guard the hulls of US boats .

"In his youth, Vice President Joe Biden once assaulted and threatened to kill a local bully who kept pushing his little sister off her bike. Biden colorfully recalled the incident at a recent women's rights charity event in New York City held to 'celebrate men who combat violence against women, 'according to the Daily Beast, which obtained and released a video of his remarks on Friday. 'I remember coming back from Mass on Sunday,' Biden told attendees of the Wednesday evening Vital Voices gala. 'Always the big treat was, we’d stop at the donut shop…We’d get donuts, and my dad would wait in the car. 'As I was coming out, my sister [Valerie] tugged on me and said, ""That’s the boy who kicked me off my bicycle."" ' Scroll down for video . Vice President Joe Biden speaks at Voices Of Solidarity Gala on December 10 in New York City. At the women's rights charity event Biden recalled slamming a local bully's head into a counter and threatening to kill him over the way he was treating Biden's little sister Valerie . Biden and his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, are pictured here walking hand in hand before entering a civil rights leaders luncheon in Selma, Alabama, in March of 2013 as they are briefed by staffer Liz Hart . Continuing, Biden said, 'So I went home—we only lived about a quarter mile away—and I got on my bicycle and rode back. And he was in the donut shop with his parents. Biden said he remembers seeing the bully 'leaning down on one of those slanted counters.' So, 'I walked up behind him and smashed his head next to the counter,' Biden said. 'I’m not recommending it,' the VP told his audience, which was cheering and laughing by that point. 'His father grabbed me, and I looked at his son and said, ""If you ever touch my sister again, I’ll come back here again and I’ll kill your son."" ' Biden then took a moment to explain 'that was a euphemism' before reminiscing about much trouble he thought he was going to get in when his father found out. 'My father never once raised his hand to any one of his children—never once—and I thought I was in trouble,' he said. 'He pulled me aside and said, ""Joey, you shouldn’t do that, but I’m proud of you, son."" ' Joe Biden is pictured in this childhood photo on the far right, sitting with his siblings Valerie and Jimmy . Biden is a fierce defender of justice for women who have been assaulted, and he draws on personal stories in his remarks on the issue. At a White House event in April commemorating the launch of the administration's Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, Biden, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said that where he comes from, 'if a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the living cr** out of him.' The No. 2 U.S. official admitted it wasn't very 'presidential or vice presidential' of him to say, but it's 'something every man should begin to understand.' He later said that assault is 'cowardly.' 'Simply cowardly to raise your hand to a woman or a child or a man who is smaller than you,' Biden told the audience.","The VP colorfully recalled the incident a women's rights charity event in New York City held to 'celebrate men who combat violence against women'

"President Barack Obama slammed the NFL as an 'old boys network' that has so far failed to send a clear message condemning domestic violence in an interview on Friday. He said the league needs a 'wake up call' as it was 'behind the curve' reacting to the footage of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee, now wife, unconscious. And if there is going to be a change in attitude, he said, it needs to start in college football where 'blind spots are rooted' and 'certain behaviors have been tolerated'. Scroll down for video . 'Old boys network': President Obama said the NFL needs to send a clear message about domestic violence . 'You don’t want to be winging it when something like this happens,' Obama told ESPN's Colin Cowherd. 'You want to have clear policies in place. 'There has been a little bit of an old boys network in terms of how it operates. 'There have been some blind spots that are rooted not just in pro football but dating back to college football and certain behaviors have been tolerated historically that really should not have been tolerated. 'Hopefully this is a wake-up call.' Obama's comments came in an interview about politics in sport with ESPN, during which he plugged his health care law. 'Behind the curve': The president said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been slow to react to the cases . 'Wake up call': He addressed the case of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice who punched unconscious his then-fiancee, now wife, Janay Palmer (both picture). Obama said it should act as a 'wake up call' for the NFL . Asked whether NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had 'too many men' around him, the president said all leaders have a duty to promote women and ethnic minorities to senior levels. But he voiced his support for the policies that are now being tabled to address athletes' off-the-field behavior. Earlier this week NFL owners unanimously voted for a new personal conduct policy to be put in place. Among the changes, unveiled in Irving, Texas, on Wednesday, are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators. An exterior body will invigilate, the statement said. Obama also addressed sports players who have used their position to make political statements about the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Another case: The league's reputation was also hampered by the case of Minnesota Vikings' Adrian Peterson who has admitted to hitting his son with a switch . LeBron James, for example, warmed up for last week's Cavaliers v Nets game in a t-shirt that read 'I Can't Breathe' - the last words of father-of-six Eric Garner who was killed in a police chokehold, and whose killer has avoided indictment. It comes after six St Louis Rams players walked on to the pitch with their hands in the air - a reference to 18-year-old Michael Brown who was claimed to have raised his hands before officer Darren Wilson shot him dead. Obama noted that athletes are citizens as well as entertainers and have a right to make their feelings known.

"A new father killed his five-week-old son because he felt fatherhood meant 'his life was over', a court heard today. Matthew Wickens, 24, lost his temper when he was left alone with baby Riley Gardener at the family home in Paignton, Devon. He shook his son, before slamming his face into a cot - causing him to suffer severe head injuries. Victim: Matthew Wickens, 24, killed his five-week-old son, Riley Gardener (pictured), because he felt fatherhood meant 'his life was over', a court heard today. He shook his baby son, before slamming his face into a cot . He then repeatedly lied about what he had done - and even tried to cover up the baby's injuries by putting a hat on him . His lies meant Riley's mother, Gemma Gardener, became a suspect and was forced to give up their other son, Jayden, for 14 months. But now, Wickens has been jailed for six years and five months after admitting manslaughter at Exeter Crown Court. Jailed: Wickens then repeatedly lied about what he had done - and even tried to cover up the baby's injuries by putting a hat on him . Simon Laws QC, prosecuting, said Wickens and Miss Gardener had had an 'on-off' relationship while she was pregnant with Riley, with the former even having 'a relationship with another woman'. He said Wickens had initially appeared fine with the idea of having a second son, but then ‘got cold feet and became . ambivalent towards fatherhood’. 'He seemed unwilling or unable to commit himself wholeheartedly to domestic life and regarded it as restricting his freedoms,' he said. But despite his apparent unwillingness, Wickens eventually moved into Miss Gardener's flat in a bid to 'prove his commitment to their relationship’, the court heard. Mr . Laws said Wickens had felt Riley's birth two years ago meant ‘his life was over’ - and that he had felt he would ‘just be a father all the time’ and not going out like his friends. The supermarket worker, who had hoped to join the Army, ‘did not like to be told what I can do and what I cannot do’ by his partner, he said. But one day, Wickens agreed to look after Riley as Miss Gardener and their older son, Jayden, went out shopping, the court heard. He bottle-fed and changed the baby, before losing his temper and assaulting his son - shaking him, before slamming his head face down into a cot. Despite Riley's severe head injuries, Wickens, who was 22 at the time, then failed to summon any medical help for his son. And . when Riley’s mother returned home with Jayden . from shopping, Wickens left her to discover her 'dying or dead son' in his bed, the court heard. He then repeatedly lied about what had . happened - and even put a hat on Riley to cover up a mark on his forehead. At one point, he claimed he had banged . his son's head against the metal arm of a baby swing, before dropping . him on the bedroom floor. Court: Mr Wickens lost his temper when he was left alone with baby Riley Gardener at the family home in Paignton, Devon. He was today jailed for six years and five months for manslaughter at Exeter Crown Court . His lies meant that Miss Gardener fell . under the suspicion of the police - and was forced to give up Jayden for . 14 months while she battled care proceedings. However, a post-mortem examination later revealed that Riley had died from shaking and an impact on November 25, 2012. Paul Dunkels QC, defending, told the court: '[Wickens] wishes to express his deep regret and remorse. He lost his temper and shook Riley and slammed his face down on to his cot.' He said Wickens had showed ‘cowardice and selfishness to not say what had happened straight away’ at the flat in the Winner Street area of Paignton. He added that the defendant may have been tired after getting up in the night to see to Riley while working long hours, but that was ‘no excuse’ because parents have to carry on. Sentencing Wickens, Judge Francis Gilbert QC told him it would remain a 'heavy burden for the rest of your life that you killed your own child'. He added that the defendant wished he could turn back the clock and that it had ‘all been a bad dream’.","Matthew Wickens killed baby Riley Gardener at home in Paignton, Devon .

"She was today crowned as 2014’s most popular model by social media site Tumblr, but it seems that Kendall Jenner’s popularity did little to help her when it came to securing a spot in Balmain’s Spring 2015 campaign – despite the fact that she counts one of the brand’s top executives as a ‘close friend’. Fans were stunned to see that 18-year-old Kendall, who was one of the stars of Balmain’s Spring/Summer show at Paris Fashion Week in September and is a firm friend of its creative director Olivier Rousteing, had failed to make the cut for the newly-launched ‘Army’ campaign, which features the likes of Adriana Lima, Joan Smalls and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Speaking to Style.com about his casting decision, Mr Rousteing said: 'If I took Kendall, it would be in a different concept with different girls. And obviously, she’s my friend, but for this campaign I wanted to have Adriana with Rosie with Isabeli with Joan and Crista.' Scroll down for video . Spring 2015: The energetic Balmain campaign  features (clockwise from bottom left) Christa Cober, 26, Joan Smalls, 26, Isabeli Fontana, 31,  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 27, and Adriana Lima, 33 . Ouch: Despite Kendall's close friendship with its creative director Olivier Rousteing (pictured), the up-and-coming supermodel, 18, failed to make the cut . The energetic campaign - a tangle of lithe squabbling supermodels - sees Adriana, 33, Joan, 26, and Rosie, 27, positioned in a series of seductive poses alongside former Chanel model Isabeli Fontana, 31. If I took Kendall, it would be in a different concept with different girls . 'You can really feel the army, you can feel the battle,' Mr Rousteing said. 'You can feel the power of the girls, and we usually don’t see that in a campaign.' The shoot also stars lesser-known model Crista Cober, 26 - incidentally the only one from the 'sexy' Balmain line-up not to have walked in the esteemed Victoria's Fashion Secret Show - something Kendall would also know something about. The striking Kardashian-descendant was notably absent from this year's high-profile show, to the surprise of many.

"Cleared: Alcee Hastings was found not to have breached House behavior standards over sexual harassment allegations . One of the most controversial Democrats in the House propositioned a high-flying policy adviser for sex then threatened to end her career when she rebuffed him, according to a House ethics report. Alcee Hastings exploded with rage and told Winsome Packer that she could forget about a political career when she repeatedly turned him down in their hotel one evening in Portugal in 2009. She told him: ‘Excuse me, I have to call my son’ and walked away in tears during the most serious incident in what she alleged was a two-year-campaign of harassment . Hastings is said to have made numerous lewd comments and after downing two Courvoisier cocktails once said that he did not know how women wore the same pair of underwear all day. Two Congressional ethics committee reports have revealed that he also repeatedly hugged Packer against her will. He once supposedly told her that ‘nobody will think you are any less professional if you have a relationship with me’. Tactile: Alcee Hastings, pictured here shaking hands with Top Chef contestant Tiffanny Derry on Capitol Hill, was accused of hugging Winsome Packer but said he 'hugs many different people' Not guilty: Winsome Packer said she was the victim of a two-year campaign of sexual harassment by Congressman Hastings but this week a Congressional committee ruled he had not breached its rules . Foreign involvement: Hastings with interns at the US Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission . Both the House Committee on Ethics and the Office of Congressional Ethics investigated Hastings - who their reports say had two girlfriends at the time - but concluded he did NOT breach the rules of conduct. They only admonished him for behavior that was ‘less than professional’ in the latest of many controversial blots on the 78-year-old’s career. The report noted: ‘Representative Hastings told the OCE that he hugged Witness 1 [Packer] every time she said he did and that he hugs many different people.’ A former federal judge, Hastings was impeached for bribery and perjury in 1988 and became only the sixth person in such a position in US history to be forced off the bench. 'I can’t sleep after having sex' - Driving with Packer to a meeting at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in 2008. 'I don’t know how women can wear the same underwear all day' - At the hotel bar in Vienna with Packer and colleagues after a long day in 2008. 'My other girlfriend isn't worthy' - The only reason I’m dating one of my girlfriends was because she helped me with a lawsuit . 'Nobody will think you are any less professional if you have a relationship with me' - At 4am in his hotel suite in Kazakhstan with a drink in his hand in 2008. ‘I come to you as a man comes to a woman...would you like to accompany me to my room?’ - Late at night in their hotel in Portugal on an official trip in 2009. ‘How dare you complain about me! You had better forget about being a Republican (politician)’ - When she told a colleague about his harassment. He has also been ranked no.1 in the House for nepotism and was accused of sexual assault before. The committee began its investigations after a complaint from Packer, who in 2007 became an advisor to the US Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission, of which Hastings was chair. A Jamaican-American, she speaks two languages and had previously served as George W Bush's appointee to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. Hastings is described as being ‘instrumental’ in getting her hired to the SCE post after, so the reports say, meeting her on the street and telling her they were hiring. She traveled the world before returning to Washington when she formally alleged she had been harassed between 2007 and 2011. Packer, 57, list numerous instances where she says Hastings crossed the line. In the reports she says that in January 2008 he invited her to come to his apartment near Washington, leaving her ‘shocked’. She did not reply and hoped that he would ‘get the message’. Later that year when she had relocated to Vienna, he visited the city on business and bought her a gift - a music box from the Czech Republic - and asked if they could live in the same apartment while he was there. On another occasion when they were driving to a meeting at the International Atomic Energy Agency he said that he ‘had difficulty sleeping after sex’, the reports state. In another incident in 2008 in Vienna Hastings made lewd comments whilst Packer and others were drinking with him at their hotel bar. He supposedly said he ‘not understand how male and female members of Congress, but especially female members, can stay in their own clothing, specifically their underwear, for 16 hours a day’. Distinguished: Alcee Hastings was elected  in 1992 and was the first African-American elected to Congress from Florida since the Civil War. He was previously a federal judge but impeached and removed from the bench . Senior figure: Hastings is Ranking Democratic member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe; a senior Member of the powerful House Rules Committee; and a Senior Democratic Whip . Packer says that he ‘specifically’ asked her about her underwear and that two colleagues who there laughed in her face when he did so. Later that night as the drinks flowed Hastings reportedly told her that the ‘only reason he was dating one of his girlfriends was because she helped him during his legal troubles’. He also said that another girlfriend was ‘not worthy’. Hastings, 78, who is divorced with three children, sparked amusement in one of Packer’s colleagues who said that she was amazed he could ‘have girlfriends in both Florida and Washington’ at the same time. Later, on a trip to Kazakhstan, he supposedly summoned her to his room as soon as she arrived at the airport. When she walked in at 4am he had a drink in his hand and told her she looked ‘good’ before saying that ‘nobody will think you are any less professional if you have a relationship with me’. The long list of alleged misbehavior continued with requests by Hastings to meet Packer for engagements that were not part of her job. She alleged that he cancelled her hotel room in Odessa in Ukraine in 2010 during a Representatives Hearing, forcing her to stay in the capital Kiev, where he would be. The prospect of this caused her to ‘hyperventilate’, the reports state, thought Hastings denied he was behind the change in arrangements. Packer also objected to Hastings touching her inappropriately and said that he hugged her for no reason and put his cheek against hers. Novel: Packer wrote a book which contained similarities to the evidence she gave as she alleged sexual harassment by Hastings . In an email to her boss in February 2010, Packer wrote: ‘I do not want Mr Hastings to hug me because I am uncomfortable with it and I insist at this point that it is not repeated’. The most serious incident was during a trip to Portugal to attend a Parliamentary Assembly Bureau in 2009. Packer and Hastings went for a work dinner with members of the OSCE and parliamentary staff, and the reports state that afterwards he propositioned her. Hastings is said to have told her she was not a ‘sport’ and that he had come to her ‘as a man comes to a woman’, but she said no. He allegedly launched into a 40 minute tirade in which he said he ‘liked’ her and had helped her career - and that he was upset because she had told a colleague about his advances. Hastings said: ‘How dare you complain about me! You had better forget about being a Republican’ - apparently a reference to her potential political career. When she rebuffed his advances yet again he demanded to know her room number but she refused to tell him and walked of. By March 2011 Packer had had enough and filed a civil harassment lawsuit, sparking inquiries by both the House Committee on Ethics and the Office of Congressional Ethics. In June this year she stepped down from her post with the SCE, citing stress-related health issues. In its findings the House Committee on Ethics said that it reviewed more than 1,000 pages of documents and spoke to eight witnesses, including Packer and Hastings. But it concluded there was not ‘substantial reason to believe’ the allegations and that there was not ‘clear and convincing evidence’ that Hastings broke the rules. It said that the Packer’s evidence was contradictory and in November 2007 she emailed a colleague to say she had a ‘crush’ on Hastings. It also pointed out there were similarities in the events she described and the plot of her 2010 novel, ‘A Personal Agenda’, which is about the ‘alienation, hostility and impropriety she experienced as a newcomer to Capitol Hill’. Floridian: Hastings congratulates Hillary Clinton in 2008 for her primary victory over Barack Obama in the state . The report did however chastise Hastings for conduct that was was ‘less than professional’ and said that its findings should be the ‘necessary corrective’ for his behavior. The report said: ‘Sexual abuse in the workplace is an extremely serious problem, in part because it is often perpetrated by very powerful people… . ‘...members must be held to account if they abuse that power’. The Office of Congressional Ethics found there was ‘probable cause’ to believe Hastings had behaved in an inappropriate manner but not that he breached House rules. Hastings’ office did not return emails asking for comment. When Packer first accused him he said in a statement: ‘I have never sexually harassed anyone. ‘In fact, I am insulted that these ludicrous allegations are being made against me. When all the facts are known in this case, the prevailing sentiment will be, 'How bizarre!' I will win this lawsuit. ‘That is a certainty. In a race with a lie, the truth always wins. And when the truth comes to light and the personal agendas of my accusers are exposed, I will be vindicated.’ Packer was elected for the 20th District of Florida in 1992 and was the first African-American Congressman to be elected from the state since the Civil War. He is a Senior Whip for the Democrats, and the ranking Democrat member of the Helsinki Commission.","Florida Democrat Alcee Hastings, 78, cleared by Congressional ethics committee of two-year campaign of harassment against Winsome Packer .

"Manchester United’s defensive disasters have prompted Louis van Gaal to consider using Michael Carrick as an emergency centre back. Central midfielder Carrick is still waiting to make his first appearance for the new United manager as he recovers slowly from an ankle injury he suffered in the summer. But the 33-year-old is now doing some training at Carrington and has already had a conversation with Van Gaal about possibly playing in the centre of defence. The Dutch coach is trying to steady the ship at the start of what is proving to be a traumatic Barclays Premier League season. Michael Carrick (centre with Chris Smalling and Ryan Giggs) could play centre-half for Manchester United . Tyler Blackett (left) and Smalling were among those to struggle in the embarrassment at Leicester on Sunday . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (centre) has plenty to ponder in the coming weeks . Carrick has filled in at the heart of defence before . United conceded a staggering five goals as they lost at Leicester on Sunday, having previously conceded four at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup and lost at home to Swansea on the opening day of the campaign. Van Gaal has lost Phil Jones and Jonny Evans to injury while young central defender Tyler Blackett was sent off on Sunday at Leicester. Evans, who has a history of ankle trouble and needed surgery two years ago, is still on crutches after limping off in the first half at the King Power Stadium. The Northern Ireland defender had a scan on Monday and the initial assessment among United’s medical staff is that he will be sidelined for four weeks. Carrick has played in the centre of the defence before during the Sir Alex Ferguson era and has the experience and intelligence to operate in that role. The fact that the former England midfielder is being considered so early in the campaign would, however, appear to provide further evidence that United erred in the summer by not buying a top-class central defender. Carrick has told friends this week that he would rather play in the central-midfield position he enjoys but he recognises that there is increased competition in that area and is ready to fill in further back without complaint. Meanwhile, Phil Neville, who was on the coaching staff at Old Trafford last season, says United may need to spend another £100million on players before they can compete for the Premier League title. ‘I know United have spent £150m,’ Neville, 37, told BBC Radio 5 Live. ‘I think there’s another two transfer windows of similar amounts of money needed — maybe £100m in all — before they can even think about winning the title. ‘There are still key positions in the team that need filling. I think the centre-back position is obviously the key area. Holding midfield or central midfield needs addressing, . ‘They needed world-class players and there were no world-class centre backs out there. In the next two transfer windows, United might still be looking for that world-class defender. ‘I am certain Chris Smalling will come good and I have full faith in Phil Jones as well. They’ve bought a lot of foreign players, you don’t get rid of your English spine.’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Authorities in southwest Ohio say they have arrested a man with a loaded handgun painted red to resemble a toy. Officers with Hamilton County's Sheriff's Office responding to a call about a man with a gun say they found 23-year-old Orlando Lowery with a red-painted .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and 9 grams of crack cocaine. The arrest took place just before 1.30am in the 9500 block of Wayne Avenue in Cincinnati. Suspect: Orlando Lowery, 23, was arrested in Cincinnati, Ohio, and booked on felony charges of carrying concealed weapons and drug possession . Lowery was charged with third-degree carrying concealed weapons and fourth-degree possession of drugs, both felonies. Sheriff Jim Neil issued a statement saying Lowery is a ‘dangerous individual’ who intentionally painted a loaded handgun red to dupe police. The arrest Friday came just four days after legislation was introduced in Ohio to require that lookalike guns be brightly colored or otherwise marked. Not fit for kids: Sheriff's officials say Lowery was carrying a loaded .380-caliber handgun painted red . That bill came in the aftermath of two police fatal shootings in less than four months of young people who were holding lookalike guns, among them 12-year-old Tamir Rice.

Liverpool are due to receive the money next month, after qualifying for the first time in five years - but in order to meet Financial Fair Play regulations clubs must not lose more than £35.4m over a period of two seasons.

"If you've ever wished you had a recording of incriminating audio - or had a permanent record of your own witty comeback - a new iPhone app, billed as the app that allows users to 'capture audio AFTER you've heard it' could be the answer. The app, called Heard, records everything the iPhone microphone picks up on a constantly rotating five-minute loop. If something happens that you want to keep a record of, 30 seconds, two minutes, or even five minutes later, you can go into the app and press 'save'. Do nothing, and the app erases the audio. Always listening: With the click of a button, users can save audio recorded up to five minutes beforehand . Once opened, the app continues to record audio even when running in the . background, albeit with a large red banner warning the user the software . is operating. In this era of surveillance, some are suspicious of the recording device. In comments made about the app on MyFoxNY, people were wary. 'There is absolutely no good reason for this app,' wrote Kyle Bradley. 'Anyone who downloads . it and doesn't expect that they're being listened to is a fool.' Steve Lee commented, 'Silly me, I thought the NSA already had that app on everyone's phone.' Another comment noted that recording people without consent is illegal in many places. 'Many . states have laws prohibiting recording of conversations without the . express consent of those being recorded. Look for iArrests coming to a . town near you,' wrote 'Ward Thrasher'. Testing, testing: The new Heard app is slightly more practical for recording audio than traditional recording devices . Critics have also questioned how the app is different from the iPhone's inbuilt recording device, which like Heard can run in the background, and the app's makers point to its five-minute recording loop. With the buffer, the user saves only the recordings they deem important, rather than saving all audio in one long, interminable file.

"Europe captain Paul McGinley has lined up former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to speak at the team dinner at Gleneagles on Tuesday evening. Ferguson is a friend of assistant captain Sam Torrance, and turned up to watch the European team practice on Tuesday morning. His presence continues a recent tradition of star performers from other sports saying a few words in the team room. Sir Alex Ferguson will speak to the European Ryder Cup team at a dinner at Gleneagles on Tuesday . Ferguson attended the FIFA and UEFA Conference for national coaches in St Petersburg last week . Four years ago it was Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards while Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola spoke at Medinah last time. 'He's a guy that I played with in the JP McManus pro-am about 15 years ago and that I've seen now and again over that time, and when I became captain I asked him,"" McGinley said of the former Manchester United manager. 'Of course he was more than willing to help. But the one thing he asked me to do was keep it really quiet. Walking around (the course) is not keeping it quiet, is it? We wanted a bit of a surprise for the players but I guess it's not a surprise.' West Ham fan McGinley joked that Ferguson would not be giving any of his team the famous ""hairdryer"" treatment, with the Hammers coincidentally making the trip to Old Trafford on Saturday. 'Although I'm a West Ham fan, I've always loved the way his teams played and there's a number of things that he's dealing with that he was particularly good at that I think he'll be a particularly strong fit,' McGinley added. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola and his family pictured at Medinah for the Ryder Cup in 2012 . 'He's asked me a lot of questions and I know he's very keen and looking forward to tonight. He's a big fan of golf, as we know. He knows Rory (McIlroy) very well and Rory is a big Man Utd fan. Not everybody in the room is a Man Utd fan, so that should be a bit fun. 'This is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them. He's very aware of that. This is relaxed. This is a conversation. There will be questions coming back at him. 'They all love football and a chance to spend a bit of time with one of the greats in soccer doesn't come around very often, particularly with somebody they all admire. In my dealings with him, he's been absolutely fantastic and I know he'll be great with the players.' Ferguson has turned up at a number of Scottish events on the European Tour over the years and is believed to play to a handicap of 18.","Europe captain Paul McGinley has asked Sir Alex Ferguson to speak at the team dinner at Gleneagles on Tuesday .

"It seems that the subject matter of the Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview was a problem at Sony long before they were hacked by a group hoping to stop the film's release. In emails that were leaked on Thursday, Sony Corporation Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai writes Amy Pascal asking that scenes from the movie featuring Jong-un be removed or edited. Pascal then shares this information with the film's star, writer and director, Seth Rogen, who is none too happy. Scroll down for video . Not happy: Seth Rogen (above), who wrote, directed and starred in the film The Interview was asked to change key scenes . From the top: Sony Corporation Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai (above) asked that scenes involving Kim Jong-un be edited or changed . Supreme leader: The Interview tells the story of two men sent to North Korea to try and kill Jong-un (above) 'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy,' wrote Rogen in an email to Pascal obtained by Bloomberg News. 'That is a very damning story.' Pascal tried to explain herself to Rogen, saying; 'As embarrassing as this has been from my point of view, you have to appreciate the fact that we haven't just dictated to you what it had to be.' She then adds, 'This isn't some flunky. It's the chairman of the entire Sony Corporation who I am dealing (with).' Indeed, in one email, Hirai tells Pascal: 'I’ve given this a lot of thought and would like to go ahead with a variation of version 337. 'It would be much appreciated if you could push them a bit further as you mentioned in your e-mail. Also, please ensure that this does not make it into the international version of the release.' In another email Pascal cites the proximity of North Korea to Japan as another reason changes might be necessary. 'I haven’t the foggiest notion how to deal with Japanese politics as it relates to Korea so all I can do is make sure that Sony won’t be put in a bad situation and even that is subjective,' she tells Rogen. Rogen agrees to make the changes, though Pascal does put in an email to Hirai that there was some 'resistance from the filmmakers.' Her again: Sony head Amy Pascal (above) was tasked with telling Rogen he had to make changes . The changes, which have to do with a major plot point, seem to take some time to deal with, and Rogen completes the task to Hirai's liking it would seem by October, writing in his final email, 'Please tell us this is over now.' And while he may have been annoyed and angered, Rogen is still very much a fan of Pascal, praising her Thursday evening at the premiere of the film. 'We want to thank Amy Pascal for having the balls to make this movie,' said Rogen. Ironically, however, the film is not set to open in Asia. The Daily Beast reports that a 'softer' version of the film - edited to take out gore - got approval from executives overseeing Mexico, Sweden, Russia, Belgium, Brazil, and France. Executives from Australia and New Zealand, however, asked for the unedited versions - saying they wanted to 'sock it to 'em' - presumably referring to North Korea. Execs from the Netherlands and Spain wanted to gorier version, too. The changes are also described in the emails, though they spoil the film, which is set to open on December 25. This is just the latest email leak from a group calling themselves The Guardians of Peace, who, as previously mentioned, want to stop the release of The Interview. Pascal said in an interview Thursday that every employee's email from the past 10 years was obtained in the hack, meaning these leaks could go on for weeks or even months. It is believed that a group from North Korea is behind the hack. The scenes that were changed are detailed in the emails, and show what an amusing and out there film The Interview will be . WARNING: Spoilers! Sony executives ordered Rogen to tone down a scene in which Kim Jong-un is hit  with a tank shell, causing his head to explode. In one email, Pascal writes to Harei: 'In shot #337 there is no face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face, and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire, as well as darkened to look less like flesh.' She then adds, 'We arrived at this shot (#337) after much cajoling and resistance from the filmmakers.' In another email, Doug Belgrad, president of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion picture group, wrote to Pascal; 'In the interest of getting this approved, I would still like to see them eliminate the tendril of flesh on the left side of his forehead that comes just before the fireball.' Harei also requested that the scene where Jong-un's head explodes not be shown in any versions of the film outside the United States.","The CEO of Sony Corporation asked Sony Entertainment Chair Amy Pascal to make changes to the upcoming film The Interview .

"Manchester United's stars have continued to drive their Merecedes, Porsches and Range Rovers to and from training - despite club sponsors Chevrolet shipping in a fleet of vehicles specifically for that purpose.

"Angel di Maria is so impressive in training his Manchester United team-mates can sometimes do no more than 'stop and stare' at the Argentine's silky skills, says Tyler Blackett. Di Maria has proven one of the few reasons for United fans to celebrate so far this season since his Premier League record move from Real Madrid in the summer. The forward has scored three goals in five games and provided the same number in assists. Angel Di Maria, celebrating his goal against Everton, impresses his Manchester United team-mates at training . Di Maria gets around Everton's Muhamed Besic in United's last Premier League outing, in which he scored . Tyler Blackett, who's appeared six times this season, says Di Maria is one of the world's best players . But his performances in training are just as eye-catching, according to 20-year-old defender Blackett. 'He's been amazing,' Blackett tells Match of the Day Magazine. 'He's one of the world's best players and the things that he does in training really make us stop and stare.' Blackett, who has played six times since being given his Premier League debut by Louis van Gaal this season, says he's happy to have Di Maria on his side rather than trying to stop him. Di Maria in action at United's Aon Training Complex, where his team-mates 'stop and stare' at his brilliance . 'The dribbling, the close control, these are things that a lot of players would like to have, but that not everybody's got. He really is special,' says Blackett. After a slow start to the season, United sit fourth on the table and came into the international break on the back of a win over Everton. Before David de Gea's heroics maintained their 2-1 lead and maximum points, it was Di Maria who was the difference. He scored the 27th-minute opener and it was his wayward shot that gave Radamel Falcao the chance to open his goal account for United with an instinctive finish for the winner. Van Gaal will be expecting a more convincing performance when his side's Premier League campaign resumes on October 20 against West Brom.

"Floyd Mayweather Jr. is still undefeated in Las Vegas after he and rapper T.I. became embroiled in a huge melee which caused chaos at a city Fatburger on Saturday morning. Two videos from that evening show chair's being thrown inside the burger joint while in another the 37-year-old Mayweather screams, presumably at T.I., for him to 'control your b****motherf*****'. Witnesses to the brawl said that T.I. approached Mayweather while he was eating and began to verbally abuse him before he allegedly threw a punch at the undefeated eight-time world champion. Scroll Down to Watch Video . Fight: Floyd Mayweather and rapper T.I. got into a brawl at a Las Vegas Fatburger restaurant . Wild: Chairs were thrown during the altercation but both Mayweather and T.I. left before police arrived . Before the brawl: Delicia Cordon, Doralie Medina and Floyd Mayweather attend a Memorial Day Weekend Party in Las Vegas . Pound-for-pound chamion, Mayweather and the 33-year-old 'I'm Serious' rapper, whose real name is Clifford Harris, faced off after the hip-hop star's wife, Tameka aka Tiny, insulted the prize-fighter. Both men's entourage's launched into furious fighting in Fatburger as the two multi-millionaire's squared-off. Eventually, the Vegas police showed up, but by then, both T.I. and Mayweather left. The world's greatest boxer left in a $1.8 million Limited Edition Grand Sport Bugatti, which he purchased last week after his $19 million fight with Marco Maidana, from which he emerged victorious. Calm before the storm: T.I. attended the LIQUID Pool Lounge at ARIA with fellow rapper Nicki Minaj shortly before the fight . Cause of concern: Lyanna Mayweather appeared in a picture with T.I.'s wife Tameka - which Tameka captioned up with the message that Lyanna was 'new boo' All smiles: Mayweather pictured with TI's wife Tameka sometime before the fight broke out . According to TMZ, the fight was sparked by a photograph that T.I.'s wife Tameka posted to Instagram of herself and Floyd's daughter, Lyanna, writing the girl was her 'new boo.' This apparently upset T.I., who felt that it was disrespectful and confronted Mayweather at the burger joint because of the photograph. Mayweather will have his next fight on September 13, ruling out a potential meeting with Amir Khan. Mayweather Promotions chief executive Leonard Ellerbe confirmed a to-be-determined opponent. Khan, who impressed on the Mayweather undercard with an excellent win over Luis Collazo, is unable to fight in September because he observes Ramadan. 'Floyd will go on September 13 and we're looking at who he's going to fight and where he is going to fight,' Ellerbe told ESPN. 'Obviously, Las Vegas is his home and the MGM Grand is always the leading candidate but we will take a look at our other options.'","Floyd Mayweather Jr. and rapper T.I. faced off against each other in a Las Vegas Fatburger on Saturday morning .

"Sir Alex Ferguson has given his first verdict on Louis van Gaal’s reign at Manchester United, suggesting the new Old Trafford manager has been ‘brilliant’. Ferguson has been an interested onlooker as Van Gaal has gone about the task of rebuilding the squad he inherited from David Moyes in the summer. The Dutch veteran has spent big as he looks to undo the damage of the 2013-14 season and the United first team now looks vastly different to the one Ferguson led to the Barclays Premier League title just 16 months ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alex Ferguson say Roy Keane overstepped the mark at United . Sir Alex Ferguson has finally given his verdict on new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal . Ferguson praised Van Gaal for trying to build his own team, saying he had the requisite experience to do so . Van Gaal has 'been doing the right thing' at United since his arrival, says an approving Ferguson . Just two players who were involved in Sir Alex Ferguson's final match as Manchester United boss were picked by Louis van Gaal for the 2-1 victory over Everton. Fergie's final match - West Brom 5-5 Man Utd (May 19, 2013) Lindegaard, Valencia, Evans (Ferdinand 83), Jones, Buttner, Carrick, Anderson, Cleverley (Giggs 60), Kagawa (Scholes 69), Hernandez, Van Persie . Van Gaal's last match - Man Utd 2-1 Everton (October 5, 2014) De Gea, Rafael, McNair, Rojo, Shaw (Blackett 71), Valencia (Fellaini 79), Blind, Mata, Di Maria, Van Persie, Falcao (Wilson  73) But Ferguson has endorsed Van Gaal’s approach and said: ‘Louis van Gaal has made a lot of changes and, thinking about that, actually, maybe he’s doing the right thing — to clear the decks and build his own team. 'Because he’s got the experience and coaching ability to do that. The way he’s approached it, I think he has been brilliant.’ Van Gaal is still integrating players like Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw into this team as United slowly creep back up the Premier League table after an uncertain start to the season. It is understood, though, that United still plan to recruit four more new players in the next two transfer windows. Van Gaal, for example, still wants a top-class central defender, a holding midfield player and a right back. The Dutchman's side have been slowly creeping back up the Barclays Premier League table after a tough start . Ferguson has attended a good number of United matches but has deliberately kept his distance from Van Gaal as the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager has settled in. The former United boss has never once regretted his decision to retire in May 2013. But speaking in an MUTV interview — called ‘Sir Alex: Life After Management’, which will be aired on the club's station on Monday — Ferguson light-heartedly recalled his first few months as a former manager. He said: ‘It was the first time I’ve ever had a holiday in my life in December and I’m sitting there at poolside in Abu Dhabi and I said to Cathy, “I should be at Carrington”.’ Ferguson and Van Gaal last faced each other with United and Bayern Munich in the 2010 Champions League . Ferguson refused to comment on extracts from former Manchester United captain Roy Keane's book . Meanwhile, Ferguson will resist the temptation to hit back at Roy Keane in print over the infamous bust-up that led to the Irishman leaving United under a cloud in November 2005. Keane has re-opened their war of words in his explosive new autobiography The Second Half in which he refers to Ferguson as a ‘f****** p****’ over the incident. Coincidentally, the second instalment of Ferguson’s autobiography, is being updated and released in paperback on October 23. However, sources at publishers Hodder & Stoughton say that Ferguson will not be adding to his existing account of the rift with Keane. Instead, he will focus on the year that followed his retirement and Moyes’ ill-fated spell. Additional reporting by Chris Wheeler . Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Lemy, the cute, curly lagotto romagnolo, gave a little yelp as she snuffled among the fallen oak leaves and started scrabbling in the earth. Wielding a small pickaxe, her owner Serge took over the dig and pulled out a muddy lump. He offered his dog a sniff before holding the golf-ball-sized black truffle aloft for us all to admire. A city to be savoured: Lyon is home to two major rivers (the Rhone and Saone) - and endless good restaurants . Deep in the French countryside, this Italian breed of duck-hunting dog is prized for its fast and accurate work. 'The Ferrari of truffle hounds!' exclaimed Serge. With our lesson on the production of the valuable fungi over, we strolled back to Serge's farmhouse, where his wife Corinne passed around delicious truffle infused canapes and glasses of wine. This excursion was just one of the epicurean treats on the inaugural cruise aboard SS Catherine, christened in April by her namesake, French film star Catherine Deneuve. In the coming days, sailing on the Rhone from Lyon, France's gastronomic capital, our noses and palates would be tickled with tastings ashore and on board of artisanal chocolate, fine wines, regional cheeses and oysters too. And all this between gourmet meals. SS Catherine is the latest lavishly and lovingly decorated vessel in the Uniworld line. Good boy: Serge and his faithful hound Emy search for buried treasure in the French countryside . The ship has a wonderful extravagance about her - original art, including works by Miro and Chagal adorns the walls. She is designed with no expense spared by Beatrice Tollman, who is also the founder and president of The Red Carnation Hotel collection, and her daughter Toni. One of them is the five-star Milestone in Kensington and if you've been there, you'll recognise the eclectic style and focus on tip-top service that guests enjoy on SS Catherine. Green-themed SS Catherine has a most striking lobby, where a specially commissioned, enormous Murano glass chandelier hangs above a large glass horse standing in front of a glass lift. Beside this is a waterfall, flanked by a wrought-iron double staircase. Custom-made green glass latticework has been handcrafted on to the mirrored walls. There is a marble fireplace, in the lounge and in the corner of Bar du Leopard there is a swimming pool with a luscious jungle mural. My cabin had a marble bathroom, three ivory and green embroidered walls and a glass one that retracted at the flick of a switch to create a balcony (with another switch to draw down a fly screen for hot nights). I awoke from a dreamless sleep in my huge bed in the town of Tain l'Hermitage, with twin town Tournon on the opposite bank. Settling in nicely: The SS Catherine offers luxury suites with glorious views of the passing scenery . By half past ten I had nibbled my way round the new, interactive La Cite Du Chocolat museum, and was watching a chef demonstrate two different chocolate mousse recipes. Which we then of course consumed. Hurrying over to Tournon, we were rewarded with generous tastes of Crozes-Hermitage wines on the terrace of a chateau, enjoying views of the vineyards across the river that produced the grapes. As we walked back to the ship across France's oldest suspension bridge, waiters greeted us at intervals, proffering trays of green and white goat's-cheese macaroons. Then it was time for lunch. The lavish buffet included local charcuterie and cheeses and comfort food, such as a clear chicken soup and a creamy rice pudding made to Mrs Tollman's recipes. Teatime, with exquisite sandwiches and pastries in the Bar du Leopard, was followed by a tasting of Rhone Valley wines and Ardeche goat's cheeses in the Van Gogh lounge, before it was time for the most sumptuous dinner of classic French dishes. Next morning, to work up an appetite before a champagne breakfast, I borrowed one of the ship's bicycles for a spin round the pretty village of Viviers, then boarded the coach setting off into the countryside for truffle-hunting. The leisurely afternoon's cruise was punctuated with a master class on Arcachon oysters, flown in from Bordeaux. During my few days on board, I learned that a cruise on SS Catherine is truly a feast, and not only for the eyes.

"A Canadian teenager has been arrested for a series of 'swatting' incidents across the United States. The 16-year-old boy has not been named but is reportedly to blame for upwards of 30 hoax calls in the U.S. He has been connected to false calls in California, Maryland, Florida, New York and Connecticut. He also faces 60 unspecified charges in Canada and was arrested on Thursday. Target: The Canadian teen, who has not been publicly identified, is believed to be behind four different threats posed against Melbourne High School in Florida over the past month . Arrogant: A Twitter account connected to the suspect shows that he publicly taunted the police . String of incidents: The threat of a shooting on May 8 was the fourth such incident that the same teen is believed to be behind . Florida Today reports that the teen is the one responsible for a series of threats posed against a high school in Melbourne, Florida over the past month. He reportedly called in a bomb threat on April 15 that led to a three-hour search and evacuation, the claim that he had a knife and stabbed someone a week later, a threat that he would start shooting a gun at Melbourne High students unless he received a large sum of money, and another threat of violence on Wednesday. Police reports claim that the suspect is a boy and Florida Today links the suspect to a Twitter account where he repeatedly taunted the FBI following his May 8 threat against the school. In one of the tweets, he laughed at the fact that two Melbourne High students had been arrested for soliciting the Canadian's help in swatting their school. All over the map: The teen has been connected to 'swatting' incident in five states and two countries . Before the slew of incidents involving Melbourne High, his April 17 target was further north in Connecticut. The Hartford Courant reported that tactical teams were dispatched to a house on Round Hill Road in response to a call where someone told police that they had a weapon and had taken several people hostage in the home. The road, which extends through the lengthy, wealthy neighborhood was closed for hours and armed police carefully approached the house, thinking that they would have to deal with a dangerous stand off. Moving up north: On April 17, the teen swatted a house in Connecticut, telling police in Greenwich that he was armed and holding hostages in this home but they later realized that there was no one inside . 'No one responded from inside the house and no one answered the phone from which the initial call was made,' police captain Robert Berry told Greenwich Time. 'Officers eventually made entry into the house and no one was found inside. 'At this time, we do not believe that there was any actual hostage situation.'","16-year-old in Ottawa arrested over hoax calls throughout the U.S.and Canada .

"Darko Milanic has been confirmed the new head coach at Leeds. The 46-year-old Slovenian, who quit as head coach of Sturm Graz on Sunday, has signed a two-year contract with the Sky Bet Championship side. He will be joined at the club by Serbian Novica Nikcevic, his assistant at the Austrian side. Caretaker boss Neil Redfearn reverts to his role of Academy manager and head of coaching after overseeing three wins and a draw. Leeds United have confirmed the appointment of Darko Milanic as their new head coach . Milanic took first team training at Leeds' base Thorp Arch on Tuesday afternoon . Milanic is the first non-British or Irish manager of Leeds and will work under Massimo Cellino . Cellino, the Leeds owner, made the new appointment which was confirmed on Tuesday evening . CLICK HERE for a full profile of the new Elland Road boss. Earlier on Tuesday, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino - who sacked David Hockaday and assistant Junior Lewis last month after only six games in charge - told Sky Sports News: ""He's just arrived today. We've been waiting for him about 15 days. ""I don't know (why I've chosen him). The coaches are like watermelons. You find out about them when you open them. ""His particular qualities? He's good looking, what can I tell you? ""He was a very good counter-attacking defender with Partizan Belgrade and Sturm Graz, and a good coach with Maribor for four years and took the club to the Champions League and Europa League, and he made it good as player and coach and he likes the Premier League. ""He gave up his place in the Premier League in Austria to come to the Championship with Leeds, and we hope that the club in Leeds is a good chance for him to have a good team and an important club to run, so he can make us proud. ""He does not talk much and is very pragmatic. I like him. He is a very cool guy."" Milanic (right) enjoyed a trophy-laden seven years as a defender for Austrian side Sturm Graz . Milanic (centre) captained Slovenia to  Euro 2000 - their first-ever qualification for a major tournament . Sturm Graz announced on Sunday that Milanic had left his post after activating a buy-out clause in his contract. He took charge of his final game for the Austrian club on Saturday. Milanic captained Slovenia at Euro 2000 and after turning to management guided Maribor to four Slovenian league titles and three Slovenian Cup wins. He joined Sturm Graz as head coach on a three-year contract in June 2013, steering the club to a fifth-placed finish in 2013-14. Cellino asked Redfearn to look after first-team affairs following Hockaday's departure. He was ruled out of the running for the job on a permanent basis by Cellino last weekend - but is expected to be closely consulted by Milanic on first-team team matters during the early weeks. Cellino had initially wanted to replace Hockaday with former Brighton boss Oscar Garcia, who opted instead for Watford, and held talks with former West Brom manager Steve Clarke and, it is understood, with Preston's Simon Grayson, who was sacked after just over three years in charge of Leeds in 2012.

"It's back again, that often derided and much maligned competition currently known as the Capital One Cup. Goodness knows the name has changed enough down the years, but the perception of English football’s second domestic cup has remained largely the same thanks to the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger; a tournament for giving the stars a rest and blooding youngsters. But everyone has start to somewhere. And as the rest of the Premier League clubs enter the fray at the third round stage, we take a look at the big names who have made their debuts in this competition, and the five stars for the future who could make it big on Tuesday and Wednesday. David Beckham, seen here celebrating the Champions League semi-final win over Juventus in 1999, made his Manchester United debut in 1992 before cementing himself in the club's history forever . John Terry, a three-time title winner with Chelsea, made his first appearance as a replacement for Dan Petrescu in the 1999 League Cup win over Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge . David Beckham . Age: 17 . Debut: Brighton 1-1 Man Utd, Sept 23, 1992 . Beckahm made his United debut in front 16,649 fans at the Goldstone Ground – nearly three years before his first league appearance – coming on for the last 17 minutes of a second round Rumbelows Cup tie as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis. Many years later he recalled: ‘The manager turned to me and said, ""Get changed, son, you’re going on"". I was so excited I bounced up off my seat and – crack – I hit my head on the dugout!’ Beckham (left) played against Brighton, while Ashley Cole began in 1999 against Middlesbrough . Ashley Cole . Age: 18 . Debut: Middlesbrough 2-2 Arsenal (3-1 on penalties) Nov 30, 1999 . Cole came on for Ray Parlour in the 89th minute of a tie that was heading for extra-time and penalties at the Riverside, Arsenal eventually losing the shootout 3-1. The future England left back was sent out on loan to Crystal Palace and made his next appearance three months later – at Grimsby. The League Cup can be the window of opportunity for young stars looking to force a way through into first-team reckoning. Here are five potential debuts to look out for over the next two nights in the Capital One Cup. Jordan Rossiter (LIVERPOOL vs Middlesbrough) Labelled as a 'potential young Steven Gerrard' by Robbie Fowler, the pressure has been on young Rossiter since he was 15. The cultured midfielder seems to have dealt with it well, though, furthering his education with the youth team and seems to be the perfect mould for Brendan Rodgers. With Jordan Henderson out, the time might be now for Rossiter to partner Gerrard in the centre. Tyias Browning (Swansea vs EVERTON) The highly-rated versatile defender penned a new three-year contract at Everton in the summer, and could make his bow against Swansea. Able to carry the ball out of defence and a strong physical presence, Browning impressed in the Championship on loan at Wigan last season. Semi Ajayi (ARSENAL vs Southampton) More of an unearthed diamond, Ajayi has followed a similar route as Carl Jenkinson in progressing to a possible debut. Signed from Charlton after a successful trial last year, the 21-year-old slotted straight into the second string and could be on the bench or even start depending on Calum Chambers' selection. Sheyi Ojo (LIVERPOOL vs Middlesbrough) Shot to fame with two goals against West Ham in the Under 21 Premier League earlier this month, and could be an option for Rodgers on the wing against Middlesbrough. Blessed with blistering pace and Raheem Sterling-like dribbling ability, Liverpool beat the likes of Chelsea to sign the 14-year-old for £2million from MK Dons in 2011. Sullay Kai-Kai (CRYSTAL PALACE vs Newcastle) An immensely talented individual following on from Victor Moses and Wilfried Zaha, Kai-Kai hit a hat-trick for the development side earlier this month. Got a taste of senior football on loan at Crawley last season, and may be given the chance to shine by Neil Warnock. MATT MORLIDGE . John Terry . Age: 17 . Debut: Chelsea 4-1 Aston Villa, Oct 28, 1998 . Two months before making his first Premier League appearance for Chelsea, Terry came off the bench to replace Dan Petrescu in the 86th minute at Stamford Bridge. The future England captain, who was voted Chelsea’s Young Player of the Year that season, went on to win the trophy in 2005 and 2007. Terry has gone on to become a Chelsea legend, 16 years after his first appearance for the club . Robbie Fowler . Age: 18 . Debut: Fulham 1-3 Liverpool, Sept 22, 1993 . The man who became known simply as ‘God’ at Anfield announced his arrival in Liverpool’s senior side by scoring with a wonderful left-foot volley on his debut at Craven Cottage, the first of 183 strikes for the club. Amazingly, Fowler followed that up by scoring five in the second leg a fortnight later, becoming one of four players in Liverpool’s history to achieve such a feat. Robbie Fowler scored on his debut at Craven Cottage in 1993, and scored five in the return leg . Cesc Fabregas . Age: 16 . Debut: Arsenal 1-1 Rotherham (9-8 on penalties), Oct 28, 2003 . The Spaniard was one of seven debutants in Wenger’s line-up, becoming Arsenal’s youngest ever player at the age of 16 years 177 days. Fabregas played 85 minutes of a tie that went to extra-time and penalties – the Gunners prevailed 9-8 in a shootout – and went on to become their youngest ever scorer as well when he netted against Wolves in the next round. Midfielder Cesc Fabregas first entered the fray in 2003 in a draw against Rotherham . Paul Scholes . Age: 19 . Debut: Port Vale 1-2 Manchester United, Sept 21, 1994 . Scholes celebrated the first of his 718 appearances for United by scoring twice at Vale Park two months before his 20th birthday, the first a cheeky dink over the goalkeeper. Amazing as it seems now, there was a storm of protest from Vale fans over Ferguson’s decision to send out an under-strength team that also included Beckham, Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Keith Gillespie. The local MP even raised the issue in the House of Commons. Paul Scholes, one of United's greatest ever players, made his debut two years later than Beckham . Jermain Defoe made his debut in the League Cup at Walsall, and scored the winner at the Bescot . Jermain Defoe . Age: 17 . Debut: Walsall 0-1 West Ham, Sept 19, 2000 . Defoe was one month shy of his 18th birthday when he went on as a 77th-minute substitute at the Bescot Stadium and scored the decisive goal seven minutes later. ‘I remember it was pouring down with rain when I came on,’ he said later. ‘Being 17, I was a bit nervous so my first touch was a pass back. Then on my second touch I just hit a shot on the volley with my left foot and it went. Unbelievable.’ Danny Welbeck . Age: 17 . Debut: Man Utd 3-1 Middlesbrough, Sept 23, 2008 . Welbeck started alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs and Nani, playing the full 90 minutes on his debut. The teenager went on to make four more appearances in the competition that season, including the final at Wembley when United beat Tottenham on penalties. Danny Welbeck started his Manchester United career with a 3-1 win over Middlesbrough in the League Cup . Wojciech Szczesny . Age: 19 . Debut: Arsenal 2-0 West Brom, Sept 22, 2009 . The Polish keeper earned his opportunity after impressing in the reserves and rewarded Wenger’s faith by keeping a clean sheet at the Emirates. But Szczesny still had to go out on loan at Brentford before establishing himself as No 1 at the club. Wojciech Szczesny was used by Arsene Wenger in the 2-0 in over West Brom at the Emirates Stadium .","David Beckham and Paul Scholes made their Manchester Untied debuts in the League Cup; Beckham in 1992 and Scholes two years later .

"Cause of death: An autopsy has determined that a bullet fired by a police officer damaged a major vein in Tamir Rice's intestines resulting in his death . Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice died from a single shot to the abdomen fired by a rookie Cleveland police officer in what has now been ruled a homicide, according to an autopsy released today. The bullet that ended the boy's life damaged a major vein and his intestines, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's findings showed. Tamir was shot outside a city recreation center on November 22 after officers responded to a 911 call about someone with a gun at a playground. Surveillance video released by police shows the boy being shot within 2 seconds of a patrol car stopping near him. He died the next day. Police have said rookie officer Tim Loehmann, 26, believed the boy had a real firearm. They later discovered it was an airsoft gun, which shoots nonlethal plastic projectiles. Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, said at a news conference earlier this week that she did not allow her son to play with toy guns, and that her son's friend gave him the pellet gun. A grand jury will consider whether charges against Loehmann are merited. The autopsy said Tamir was 5-foot-7 and weighed 195lbs. The report did not say how long it took officers to administer medical help after he collapsed to the ground mortally wounded. A federal lawsuit filed by the boy's family against the City of Cleveland and the police department claimed that Loehmann and his partner, seven-year veteran Frank Garmback, waited four minutes before anyone provided first aid to Tamir. Scroll down or video . Final moments: In footage released by the Cleveland Police Department, a police car pulls up alongside the boy. But rather than raise his hands, his reaches for his belt line, they claim. He was then shot . Shooter: Rookie officer Tim Loehmann, (pictured far left), was put on leave after the shooting. It has since emerged that he previously left another police department after his seniors said he lacked maturity . The lawsuit also said the two officers acted recklessly when they confronted Tamir in a terrifying manner, driving within feet of him and firing within seconds. Samaria Rice said the officer who fired the fatal shot should be convicted of a crime. The officer's father has said his son had no other choice because he thought the weapon Tamir was seen reaching for in his waistband was real, given that it lacked the orange tip indicating that it was a toy. Several peaceful protests have taken place since the shooting, which has come at a time when police-involved deaths around the nation have drawn on spotlight on departments and their use of force. Enraged: Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice, speaks during a news conference at the Olivet Baptist Church in Cleveland Monday, saying the officers involved should be criminally convicted . Samaria Rice said at a news conference earlier this week that she did not allow her son, pictured in the photo, to play with toy guns, and that her son's friend gave him the pellet gun . Last week, the US Justice Department released the results of a nearly two-year investigation of Cleveland police that found its officers use excessive and unnecessary force far too often. The report was completed before Tamir's death. Officer Loehmann joined Cleveland police in March after spending six months in 2012 with the police department in suburban Independence. The Rice family's lawsuit filed laws week noted that personnel files showed that police supervisors in Independence decided Loehmann was 'weepy,' 'distracted' and lacked the maturity needed to work in their department. A letter in his file said there was a pattern of a lack of discretion and not following instructions. 'In law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and I am under the impression Ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed,' the letter said. Loehmann resigned from the Independence Police Department in December 2012 after meeting with his supervisors about their concerns. Rice's attorney, Benjamin Crump, told reporters Monday that a grand jury was not necessary and that there was enough probable cause from the video to indict. Tragic: Pallbearers carry out the 12-year-old boy's casket from Gaines Funeral Home last week . Pastor Henry Currie of Mary B. Wise Baptist Church collects himself during services for Tamir December 3 . 'The things that he did in that video, which I suggest is enough probable cause to indict the police officer now and have a trial jury where everybody can see it, where it can be transparent,' Crump said. Samaria Rice said her sixth grader was her 'baby' and was loved by everyone, adding that he helped at school and at the recreation center where he was killed. 'Tamir was a bright child, he had a promising future, and he was very talented in all sports - soccer, basketball, football - he played the drums, he drew, he played video games, he's a great swimmer,' Rice said.","Autopsy determined a bullet damaged a major vein in Tamir's intestines .

"A baby in India born with a 12cm 'tail' has had it removed at just five days old. The as yet unnamed child was born with a heteropagus conjoined twin, where his sibling was anatomically incomplete and had formed as a tail on his back. He underwent a four-hour operation to remove the 350g growth, despite the fact keeping it could have given him a privileged life in India. The Indian boy, who has yet to be named, underwent a four-hour operation to remove the 350g growth . The child was born with a heteropagus conjoined twin, where his twin was anatomically incomplete and had formed as a tail on his back . Twelve-year-old Arshid Ali Khan, or Balaji to his worshippers, has a six inch tail and Hindu followers flock to see him daily at his temple near Chandigarh, northern India. If left untreated, this child's growth may have become cancerous, so his parents and medical team at Aarna Superspeciality Hospital, in Ahmedabad, north west India, were keen to operate. His mother, Jamnibhen Patel, from Fatehgarh village, in Gujarat, says she was devastated her fourth child had such a deformity. The 30-year-old said: ‘I was shocked when I saw my baby boy. His tail resembled lord Hanuman [the monkey god] but I wanted it off immediately. I was in tears and felt very sad for him. ‘I’m extremely happy he’s been operated on and doctors have told me he is now safe. I couldn’t imagine raising a son with a tail, even if people believe he’s a reincarnation of Hanuman.’ Dr Rohit Joshi, chairman of the hospital where surgery took place, said: ‘Heteropagus conjoined twins are asymmetrically conjoined twins. [They] differ in several ways from symmetrical conjoined twins, as they have no major connection of vessels, bowels or bones. ‘It is more commonly reported in India and Africa.’ He added that such an anomaly can be detected in the prenatal period with an ultrasound and then confirmed with an MRI scan. Doctors say heteropagus conjoined twins differ in several ways from symmetrical conjoined twins, as they have no major connection of vessels, bowels or bones . The boy's parents Jamnibhen (left) and Kanjibhai (second left) wanted the growth removed. He was treated by staff at the Aarna Superspeciality Hospital, in Ahmedabad . However the boy's father, Kanjibhai Patel, 32, a farmer earning 12,000 Rupees (£120) a month, said he could not afford any medical assistance during the pregnancy. He added: ‘My wife has already had three other healthy children with very normal deliveries so we never expected our fourth child to be deformed. 'I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw him – no child should suffer a tail. How would they go on to live a normal life? ‘My wife and I discussed it for a while and we decided it was best for his future to have it removed. We didn’t want him to be teased at school or throughout his adulthood. So we asked our family and community to donate or loan us where possible to help us pay the 100,000 Rupees (£1,000) for surgery. I am very happy he doesn't have a tail now.’ The little boy has now been discharged from hospital and is back at home with his family recovering. Other Indian children, such as Arshid Ali Khan, have kept their 'tails'. He said: ‘I love my tail. It’s a gift from God. It’s unusual but people respect me and bow before me because of it. I feel special.’ The boy's parents decided to have his 'tail' removed, despite the the fact keeping it could have given him a privileged life in India. Twelve-year-old Arshid Ali Khan (pictured), or Balaji to his worshippers, has a six inch tail and Hindu followers flock to see him daily at his temple near Chandigarh, northern India .

"A morbidly obese 13-year-old girl who weighed more than 200lbs has managed to lose more than a third of her body weight after undergoing gastric surgery in March. Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, suffered from a rare condition called hypothalamic obesity, a disease which leaves sufferers feeling constantly hungry and saw the teenager put on more than 150lbs over a two year period. But after undergoing a complex surgical procedure to reduce the size of her stomach, she is now happily on the road to recovery - and is, according to her mother, looking and feeling healthy for the first time in years. Healthy and happy: Alexis Shapiro has lost almost 60 pounds since undergoing gastric surgery in March . On the road to recovery: While her mother Jenny admits that the family still have a long road ahead, Alexis is back at school and is even taking part in sporting activities . Dangerously ill: Alexis, pictured here in January, put on more than 150lbs in two years after being diagnosed with hypothalamic obesity in 2011 . 'We began 2014 in the darkest, lowest place,' Jenny Shapiro told the Today show. 'But as the months rolled by, we slowly climbed up the mountain. Today, we get to see the pretty view. My daughter, Alexis, is healthy. We have not been able to say that for a long time.' Alexis' condition was first brought to light in 2011, after her insurance company denied her parents' request to allow her to undergo a gastric bypass - which they believed would help her to fight her condition and, ultimately, save her life. Desperate to ensure that their daughter receive the necessary medical treatment, Alexis' parents began an online campaign to raise the money that would pay for the surgery. The campaign proved to be an incredible success - and saw donations pouring in from generous supporters around the world, eventually raising more than $80,000. And now, eight months after undergoing the gastric sleeve procedure, Alexis is back at school and working towards a full recovery - and is even able to take part in organised sports and physical activities, something which two years ago seemed an impossibility. Brave girl before: Alexis underwent the complicated procedure in March - and spent months in recovery . In happier times: Alexis was a healthy, happy little girl before being diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2011 . Online support: Alexis' parents raised more than $80,000 after starting an online campaign to try and pay for her gastric surgery . 'Alexis has been doing really good,' 35-year-old Jenny wrote on a Facebook page set up in support of her daughter. 'She still doesn't like going to school and gives me a hard time sometimes but she tries her best. 'She gets very very tired from school. She likes math, reading, and language arts. She doesn't like music, or computers. She likes learning! She walks about a half mile or more everyday at school. 'She is still scared to try new things that she couldn't do while she was much heavier, but we are trying. Thank you everyone for caring!' But Jenny makes clear that her daughter still has a long way to go, writing in a piece for the Today show : 'This is not the spot where we’ll finish our journey. 'But from here, we can see life so much better. Before, something enormous was blocking our view: We didn’t know how much longer we had with Alexis. Today, we see her future.'","Alexis Shapiro was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and the treatment left her with a condition called hypothalamic obesity .

"Manufacturing of the chip that will power next year's iPhones and iPads has begun at Samsung's plant in Austin. Samsung has begun mass production of the A9 chip,  according to a report in Korea’s Electronic Times. Apple is expected to update its current iPhone 6 and 6 plus with the next generation chips- and launch a new 4inch handset to replace the 5c, according to recent reports. Scroll down for video . Reports claim Apple may hold two iPhone launch events next year to release its iPhone 6S (a successor to its iPhone 6 pictured) in spring, and its iPhone 7 in September. The iPhone 6S may even go on sale at the same time as Apple’s Watch, according to some claims. A 4-inch version of the iPhone 6 is in development to replace the iPhone 5c as a lower cost and 'female friendly' deisgn, it has been claimed. The handset will be launched during 2015, according to Chinese rumour site Feng.com. It follows a move towards larger screen sizes, with the most recent models boasting 4.7 and 5.5inch screens. Production was said to have begun on Thursday at Samsung's foundry in Austin, Texas, as part of an effort by Apple to move chip production back to the U.S. It had been reported back in July that Samsung had received some orders for the chips, which the company effectively confirmed in October when the president of the company’s chip-making division said that profits would improve once it began supplying its latest-generation chips to Apple. The South Korean company has built custom mobile chips for Apple since the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, but recently has seen its position reduced. Reports say Apple may hold two iPhone launch events next year, to release its iPhone 6S in spring, and its iPhone 7 in September. It is also believed to be developing a 4 inch 'female friendly' handset to replace the current 5c. The claims were made by ‘sources in the supply chain’ to Jerry Miller from Stabley Times. Until 2013, Apple released one handset each year around September time. This included a new model one year, followed by a slightly modified 'S-version' the year after. Last year, however, it used its September launch event to announce two new devices - its flagship iPhone 5S and the ‘cheaper’ iPhone 5C. This was followed by the launch of its iPhone 6 and larger iPhone 6 Plus this year. The new schedule is expected to stagger the releases of two devices in 2015 to capitalise on sales. Apple could release the iPhone 6S to people who want to upgrade to a slightly cheaper model, before announcing its flagship iPhone 7 in the autumn. Until 2013, Apple released one handset each year around September time. Last year, however, it used its September launch event to announce two new devices - its flagship iPhone 5S and the ‘cheaper’ iPhone 5C (pictured). This was followed by the launch of its iPhone 6 and larger iPhone 6 Plus this year . Amidst the furore of the iPhone 6 launch in September, Apple silently killed off its Classic iPod. But it wasn't a drop in sales that brought about its demise, according to boss Tim Cook, instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts. Speaking at the WSJD Live conference, Mr Cook said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player. And although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years, sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin. Mr Cook added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. The 6S may also be packaged together with the Apple Watch. ‘Our source says that Apple is hesitant about launching the iWatch in the spring of 2015 without a new iPhone to go along with it,’ explained Mr Miller. ‘[This] could give hesitant consumers an excuse to wait on buying both until the fall.’ The news comes as manufacturers revealed Apple has plans to kill off its iPhone 5C as early as next summer. Launching a phone in spring would mean there was still the same number of handsets in the range once the iPhone 5C was discontinued. The report, by Taiwan's Industrial and Commercial times, did not reveal the reasons behind the plans, but Apple has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions. Sales of the 5C were also poor, compared to the company's expectations, and in January, research firm CIRP reports the model accounted for just 27 per cent of iPhone sales at the end of 2013. Manufacturers will begin winding down production of the handset from January, and are expected to pull the plug completely by the 'middle of 2015.' Apple launched its iPhone 5C alongside the high-end iPhone 5S in September 2013. It is similar in size to the 5S, but doesn't t have the Touch ID fingerprint scanner or the A7 processor seen in the more expensive model. It has a plastic case, is available in five different colours, and at launch, prices started at $99 in the US, on a two-year contract, or $549 and £469 when bought outright. The device was also the first Apple phone to be offered in the smaller 8GB model. Apple also recently killed off its iPod Classic. The news comes as manufacturers revealed Apple has plans to kill off its iPhone 5C  next summer. Sales of the 5C (pictured at launch with Apple executive Phil Schiller) were lower than expected. Launching a phone in spring would mean there was still the same number of handsets in the range once the 5C was discontinued . When Apple’s online store came back online following its iPhone 6 event in September, this later model was missing from the iPod lineup. Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time. Apple boss Tim Cook later said the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. 'We couldn't get the parts anymore, not anywhere on Earth,' explained Mr Cook. 'It wasn't a matter of me swinging the axe, saying ""What can I kill today?"" The Classic was the Apple’s first digital music player, and although the original debuted in 2001, there were six generations released up until 2007. Apple is said to be forsaking its iPhone 5C to focus on production of its high-end iPhone 6 range.","Apple's A9 chip expected to power next generation iPhones and iPads .

"Listen out in the 16th minute of Chelsea’s game against Schalke tonight and amid the usual din of the Veltins Arena there may be a ripple of applause and a chorus of 'One Di Matteo'. Chelsea supporters treat their legends with respect. Remember how they sang for Frank Lampard at Manchester City, even after he had scored a late equaliser against them. The 16th minute ovation in honour of Roberto Di Matteo’s shirt number became a staple of Chelsea games after he had been fired to make way for Rafa Benitez. Roberto Di Matteo gets organised before Schalke's training session at Veltins-Arena on Monday . Di Matteo (centre) speaks to his players ahead of his side's Champions League clash with Chelsea . Jose Mourinho may not like it but the travelling Chelsea fans will surely hail Di Matteo tonight . It might not go down too well with Jose Mourinho and it might be uncomfortable for those in the posh seats who sacked him, but two thousand or so expected to make the trip from London are sure to hail Di Matteo. He was, after all, not only a popular former player but the man in in charge (albeit on an interim basis) on the greatest night in the club’s history, when they beat Bayern Munich on penalties to win the Champions League. The Swiss-born former Italy international was dismissed six months later and spent two years out of the game, devoting time to his family while doing media work, watching games and studying football. Di Matteo proudly holds the Champions League trophy after his side's victory over Bayern Munich in 2012 . Di Matteo celebrates with Blues skipper John Terry (right) on that historic night . Schalke moved after sacking Jens Keller. The appointment was confirmed on October 7 and he won his first game against Hertha Berlin. 'This is a big club,' said Di Matteo. 'It has a big fan base and a very good squad. I’ve always enjoyed the Bundesliga. I just had the feeling it was the right move to take on this challenge.' He is the club’s seventh manager since 2008, a difficult period during which the club from Gelsenkirchen have had to watch the rise and rise of their fierce rivals Borussia Dortmund. The 16th minute ovation in honour of Roberto di Matteo’s shirt number became a staple of Chelsea games . Having been raised in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, Di Matteo has no language barriers and he has arrived with a certain status as a former Champions League winning boss. The 44-year-old will not be paid anything like the £130,000 a week he earned at Chelsea - and continued to earn during his time out - but this move is all about returning to the competitive world and developing his education as a coach. Like many new managers who arrive with the transfer window closed, the first thing Di Matteo did was to claim the players might be in better shape and launch into a fitness drive. Didier Drogba’s header and winning spot kick at the Allianz Arena will forever be etched in Blues folklore . Schalke have won four and lost three since his appointment - the victories have all come in the Veltins – and after a dreadful injury-hit start to the campaign have started to creep up the Bundesliga table. Injuries are still interfering with his plans. Julian Draxler will not play against Chelsea after pulling a thigh muscle, 11 seconds into the game against Wolfsburg, last weekend. Sead Kolasinac and Jefferson Farfan are long-term injury absentees. The 3-2 win against Wolfsburg eased Schalke up to seventh in the league, but defeat against Sporting Lisbon in Portugal earlier this month means their place in the knock-out stages of the Champions League is far from secure. Sporting are at home to Maribor of Slovenia on Tuesday night. Julian Draxler, in action against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last November, will miss Tuesday night's game . 'We won on Saturday, we’re playing at home and morale is good,' said Di Matteo. 'There are positives for us to tap into. But we’re playing an unbeaten opponent and we have to give our best performance. They play very well as a team together, so we have to play at our maximum.' Roman Abramovich pulled the trigger on Di Matteo because of doubts about his tactical acumen and coaching experience at the very top level. Benitez did not work out but with Mourinho back and Chelsea on top of the Barclays Premier League it is a happy vibe at the club again. Di Matteo may never persuade everyone that the 2012 Champions League triumph was down to him. In fact, he doesn’t try. Schalke's 3-2 win against Wolfsburg eased Di Matteo's side up to seventh in the Bundesliga . Like others, he prefers to give credit to Chelsea’s players for salvaging the tie against Napoli, defying the odds to beat Barcelona despite playing more than half of the second leg of the tie in the Nou Camp with 10 men and beating Bayern in their own stadium. The final in the Allianz Arena will always be remembered for three penalty saves by Petr Cech and Didier Drogba’s header and winning spot kick, rather than any tactical brilliance by Di Matteo. But this may be unfair. He produced a balanced team from an imbalanced squad at Chelsea and, with four key players suspended in the final, organised his side well and produced a surprise by using Ryan Bertrand on the left wing to add stability. Roman Abramovich pulled the trigger on Di Matteo six months after Chelsea's Champions League triumph . He also showed an ability to manage the big egos, which has become a sizeable part of the job at the elite level. Not everyone in Germany is convinced Di Matteo is the man to revive this proud old club but he has a history of success as a player and a manager and an ability to influence the big occasions. It will not be wise to completely rule out the idea he will be the first to inflict defeat on Chelsea this season.","Chelsea face Roberto Di Matteo's Schalke side at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen in the Champions League on Tuesday evening .

"A mother searched 'insanity' online before throwing her six-year-old autistic son off a 130-foot bridge, a court has heard. Jillian McCabe also looked up 'not guilty by reason of insanity' on Google, prosecutors revealed as they debate whether the 34-year-old is mentally fit for trial. McCabe has been charged with aggravated murder, murder and manslaughter after throwing her son London to his death over Yaquina Bay Bridge in Newport, Oregon, on November 3. Family members said that Jillian McCabe (above in her mugshot) was mentally unstable prior to allegedly throwing her six-year-old son from an Oregon bridge . She reported herself by calling 911 that night. It took a search crew hours to find the little boy's body, CBS reported. The incident came months after McCabe posted a number of blogs and videos on social media sites trying to raise money for the care of her son and husband, who was diagnosed with MS at the end of last year. In one video, recorded last year, the 34-year-old talked about how hard it was to raise her 'severely autistic' son and her desire to 'pull a Thelma and Louise'. Today it emerged she allegedly told officers on the scene that voices in her head made her do it. In a probable cause affidavit, which was issued on Tuesday prior to her arraignment, she called 911 after throwing her son 100 feet from the bridge. The body of London McCabe, aged six, was found on Monday after his mother allegedly threw him from an Oregon bridge . She reportedly told dispatchers shortly after 6pm that her son was 'in the water and gone'. She then described what her son was wearing along with his date of birth and details of his physical appearance. Mrs McCabe, whose husband Matt is battling multiple sclerosis, claimed voices in her head told her to throw her son, Newport Police Chief Mark Miranda told OregonLive. Another police officer revealed in witness statements that he had earlier passed the woman carrying a boy 'who seemed too big to be carried' on to the center of the bridge. Both Newport Police Department and the District Attorney's Office refused to comment on the case to MailOnline today. Kelly Beaudry, principal of Crestview Heights School in Waldport, said on Wednesday that London McCabe was filled with laughter and loved to sing. Ms Beaudry said the school will be dedicating a wall in his memory. Samples of his work with be posted and teachers can bring students to share their feelings. The state medical examiner's office said an autopsy was being conducted on the boy. McCabe, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was taken in after authorities discovered the body of her son London in Oregon's Yaquina Bay just hours after she allegedly threw him off the bridge. Family members close to McCabe describe the young mother as mentally unstable, and old videos and blog posts written by the woman seem to highlight her difficulties raising a child with severe autism. Family members said her downward spiral began soon after her father died and her husband, Matt, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 'I'm sorry but to wake up one day and your whole world is topsy-turvy in a world that already was topsy-turvy with our son,' Jillian said of the situation in a 2013 video. Jillian McCabe (left), who was arrested after she allegedly threw her severely autistic son London (right) off  a bridge on Monday evening, had talked of 'pulling a Thelma and Louise' in the past . The mother allegedly carried her son to the center of the Oregon bridge and threw him into the water 100ft below on Monday night . 'All of a sudden, my husband who was your provider, the caregiver, my captain Kirk, and its hard to talk to him, and everything's hard.' In that same video, which she recorded and posted to thank her friends and people who were supporting her and her family financially after Matt lost his job, Jillian said; 'Matt and I love you guys. ... If we don't know you, we still love you. 'You are making this experience livable versus us pulling a Thelma and Louise, which I have totally thought about.' Other videos on her YouTube page show London throwing coins into a fountain, playing with his iPad on a hammock, and visiting his father in the hospital. Tanya McCabe, London's great-aunt, told NBC News: 'Jillian really struggled with her mental health and I know she was just out of her mind when this happened.' Loving father: In addition to her autistic son, Jillian's husband Matt McCabe (above) was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis last year . She added: 'It was terrible what we went through to get her the help she did get. We worked full-time to get her the services but obviously they weren't sufficient.' Tanya McCabe also said how shocked and heartbroken she was to find out what happened to London. 'Jillian was always so patient with him, and loving. She really had a lot of compassion for his condition,' she said. 'When he was screaming at the top of his lungs, which was the only way he could communicate, she didn't get upset at all. She would calmly comfort him, and I was amazed at how patient she was.' One family member, Tanya McCabe, described Jillian as 'patient and loving' when she was caring for son London who had severe autism (above) Matt McCabe (above with son London) has yet to comment on what happened. Mr McCabe was diagnosed with MS late last year . London's uncle, Andrew McCabe, also cited Jillian's mental instability as the cause of this horrific tragedy. He told NBC: 'The state of health care in the country and the lack of prioritization that we have especially for our mentally ill is appalling. And its heartbreaking and unfortunately there’s tragic results when people don’t get the help they need.' “She took him for a walk and did what she did,” he added. McCabe was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, murder, and first-degree manslaughter on Monday and is being held on $750,000 bail. The Newport Police Department said that Jillian McCabe had been located near the bridge and interviewed by detectives prior to the discovery of her son's body . Her first hearing will be on November 12.","Jillian McCabe, 34, searched 'not guilty by reason of insanity' on Google .

"Oscar Pistorius may not get early release from his gang-ridden jail where he is fed rations of buttered bread because the electronic tagging device cannot be fitted securely to his prosthetic leg, it emerged today. The revelation came as South African prosecutors said their request to appeal the athlete's manslaughter conviction and five-year prison sentence would be heard on December 9. The runner had hoped he would qualify for home detention curfew with a tag after serving just ten months of his sentence. But MailOnline can reveal that prison bosses have told him he can't take part in their tagging scheme because the device cannot be properly monitored if it is fixed to a prosthetic leg. The tags cannot by law be fixed to an offender's wrists as they are too easily removed. Scroll down for video . Blow: Oscar Pistorius is comforted by his lawyer Barry Roux during his sentencing for the manslaughter of Reeva Steenkamp. His hopes of early release from a five-year jail sentence have been dashed after prison officials said their electronic tagging scheme cannot be properly monitored if it is fixed to his prosthetic leg . Cannot be used on false limbs: The Paralympian is pictured in 2008 taking off his prosthetic running shoes and putting on his special blades which he uses to compete in. Prison officials said the electronic tag which monitor parolees cannot by law be fixed to an offender's wrists as they are too easily removed . Pistorius, 27, had both legs amputated as a child and relies on prosthetic legs for his mobility. South Africa's Correctional Services Department started a pilot scheme for tagging offenders in April. Pistorius told his defence team he believed he was a suitable case with no previous convictions for violence. But prison sources said yesterday: 'The device has to be attached physically to the offender's ankle. 'We cannot use it on false limbs which could be left somewhere static while the offender goes missing.' Pistorius had hoped to leave his cell in the hospital wing of Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru prison to spend the remainder of his sentence at his uncle's luxury home in the city's Waterkloof suburb where there is a gym and swimming pool. Stark: Prisoners are lined up inside the Kgosi Mumpuru 11 Management Centre during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband. Pistorius is being held in the hospital wing of jail . Grim: Prison officials search an inmate's cell. Pistorius is said to be quiet and calm in prison after an initial meltdown during his first few days when other inmates heard him sobbing himself to sleep (file picture) He was living with his wealthy uncle Arnold and family members throughout his seven-month trial for the killing of blonde model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. He fired four shots at her through the door of a locked toilet cubicle in the early hours of the morning. In a sensational case which shocked TV viewers worldwide as it was filmed live in the West Gauteng High Court, Pistorius wept and howled his way through evidence during six days in the witness box, denying that he intentionally killed 29-year-old Miss Steenkamp. He was acquitted of premeditated murder and of the South African judicial category 'dolus eventualis' – meaning he foresaw the result of his actions – but was convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years. Last month, the National Prosecuting Authority announced it would apply for leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence, claiming that he should have been found guilty of 'dolus eventualis' and received a heavier sentence. Meanwhile, Pistorius is being kept in isolation – in the same prison cell where South Africa's disgraced former Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi was locked up for 229 days at the start of his 15-year sentence for fraud and corruption in August 2010. He had taken bribes from convicted drug dealer Glenn Agliotti who was given immunity from prosecution to give evidence against him. Victim and killer: Model Reeva Steenkamp died after Pistorius fired four shots at her through a locked toilet door at his home on Valentine's Day last year . The case against respected anti-apartheid struggle hero Selebi rocked South Africa. He had been President of Interpol at the time of his arrest. During his incarceration, he suffered a collapse from a kidney disease and was discharged on medical parole to serve the remainder of his sentence at home. Selebi had been placed in the isolation cell for his own protection against maximum security prisoners who are notoriously led by the murderous Numbers gangs. Now Pistorius is in Selebi's former cell due to similar worries over his safety and security. But he enjoys few luxuries despite the extra protection. He has no TV in his cell and is not allowed a mobile phone. His day starts at 5.30am when he washes, dresses and tidies up his cell. He has two sets of bright orange prison overalls and has been allowed to keep his own white T-shirts and tracksuits. Breakfast of porridge with coffee or juice is brought to him at 7am. Pistorius is said to be quiet and calm in prison after an initial meltdown during his first few days when other inmates heard him sobbing himself to sleep. Prison sources say that his current mood seems to be one of relief. He has been told that, even without release on a tagging system, he may be able to apply for parole after 10 months. His cell is two metres by three metres in size with a grill and a solid steel door. He has a small cupboard, a bed with a sponge mattress and two blankets, a wash-basin and toilet. He shares a shower room with the prisoner in the adjoining cell and maintenance men are currently busy installing a bath for them. Fearing the worst: Pistorius was clearly aware of the dangers of prison life as he stood for sentencing at the end of his trial. When police led him down the stairs to the holding cells, he discreetly slipped his expensive designer watch into his uncle Arnold's hand (above) as they reached out to each other for a few seconds . Pistorius is spending long periods reading the Gideon Bible given to him on admission and will be able to borrow other books from the prison library once he has ventured out. His cell opens onto a small bare courtyard and he is able to speak to the prisoner in the neighbouring cell. He is said to be eating the same food as other inmates, but will be allowed to also buy pies, hot dogs, sweets and chocolates from the prison tuck shop using money given to him by family visitors. At midday, he is brought a basic meal which includes meat of some kind with carbohydrates and vegetables. The last meal of the day is slices of buttered bread with a hot drink, served at 4pm. All the prison food is prepared in one huge kitchen catering for 7,000 inmates. Pistorius is expected to take part in rehabilitation programmes, which could mean him giving exercise classes to other prisoners. But so far he is reluctant to intermingle for reasons easy to understand. Take him away: Members of the South African Police Service escort Oscar Pistorius in the back of an armoured police vehicle as he is transported from the High Court in Pretoria to prison . The hospital wing contains nine other inmates, among them suspected mafia hitman Radovan Krejcir, a fugitive from the former Czechoslovakia. Pistorius was briefly introduced to them when he arrived. He is currently undergoing a 21-day risks and needs assessment and will later be obliged to join rehab or skills-training courses in the prison workshops. Pistorius is a Group A prisoner, a category extended to convicted police officers, soldiers, elderly prisoners and the sick. He is not considered to be a danger to others, and the category provides him certain privileges such as the right to weekly visits of one hour's duration from friends or family members. They can also bring him food parcels. Correctional Services Department spokesperson Sibongile Khumalo admitted that his category means 'he has some form of preferential treatment for his own safety'. Pistorius was clearly aware of the dangers of prison life as he stood for sentencing at the end of his trial. When police led him down the stairs to the holding cells, he discreetly slipped his expensive designer watch into his uncle Arnold's hand as they reached out to each other for a few seconds. The National Prosecuting Authority had described Pistorius sentence for killing Reeva Steenkamp as 'shockingly light' when it announced its intention to appeal the manslaughter verdict. His legal team has opposed the move, setting the stage for a hearing before the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria in a month.","Athlete hopes for release after just ten months for killing Reeva Steenkamp .

"Queens Park Rangers midfielder Sandro is facing a spell on the sidelines after injuring his knee while celebrating a goal in training. The former Tottenham star, who missed much of last season after a serious knee injury, scored and slid on his knees to celebrate. But because the dryness of the pitch at the Harlington training ground, the Brazilian hurt his knee. Sandro has injured himself during a QPR training session after celebrating a goal by sliding on his knees . Harry Redknapp confirmed the Brazilians problem during an interview with talkSPORT on Tuesday morning . DAVE BEASANT: Severed the tendon in his big toe after dropping salad cream on it in 1993. DAVID JAMES: Once pulled a muscle in his back when reaching for the remote control. RIO FERDINAND: During his spell at Leeds, the England defender managed to pick up a tendon strain in his knee watching television. DAVID BATTY: Managed to re-injure his Achilles tendon when he was run over by his toddler on a tricycle . It caused him to miss the 2-2 draw with Stoke on Saturday and manager Harry Redknapp is facing an anxious wait over how long he will be without the midfielder. It looks almost certain he will miss Saturday’s trip to in-form Southampton and is facing a race against time to be fit for the London derby against West Ham the following weekend. The bizarre injury set-back has frustrated Redknapp, who is already without Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch through injury. Redknapp confirmed to talkSPORT: ‘Sandro injured his knee after scoring a goal in training and sliding on the dry ground celebrating.’ Sandro admitted he nearly retired in 2012 when a knee problem ruled him out for an entire season. The South American only arrived at Loftus Road in a £10million deal on transfer deadline day.

"Marc Muniesa wants to be a centre-half – on this evidence the former Barcelona starlet could find himself at centre-forward. Stoke are yet to score at home in the Barclays Premier League this season but are unbeaten on the road and their Spanish left back was the unlikely hero, scoring twice to sink last season’s beaten finalists. The 22-year-old is seen as understudy to Erik Pieters at Stoke but his two emphatic strikes at the Stadium of Light could have the likes of Peter Crouch and Mame Biram Diouf looking over their shoulders.

And Potters boss Mark Hughes said:  ‘He’s only ever scored four goals in his career. Given his pedigree, we know he is technically gifted and I can play him at centre half or left back. He’s probably got the ability to play in midfield. ‘Because of that ability he’s able to affect the game when he finds himself in different areas of the field, and that’s what he did.’ Muniesa — who made his Barca debut at 17 — had not scored since his days in the Segunda Division with their B team. The Spanish under-21 international smashed a sumptuous response to Jozy Altidore’s 16th-miniute opener for Sunderland, holding off John O’Shea before driving through the legs of Costel Pantilimon. Both sides were lucky to finish the half with 11 men after Jack Rodwell’s late lunge triggered a throat-grabbing retaliation from Steven Nzonzi, a confrontation for which both were booked. Will Buckley twice went close to restoring Sunderland’s advantage before Muniesa struck again after 72 minutes.

The American rolled Robert Huth on the fringe of the area before shooting into the bottom corner. Poyet said: ‘It was important for him. It’s been difficult for him. He knows he needs to score to convince people. ‘I don’t think we played badly. Some decisions didn’t go our way, like the player grabbing (Rodwell) by the neck. The rules say that is a red card.’ Hughes, though, felt Stoke’s victory was well deserved, saying: ‘Yes, (goalkeeper) Jack Butland was excellent, but the best team won on the night.’ Mame Biram Diouf has impressed so far this season,and scored a brilliant goal against Manchester City .

At the height of its popularity, Zynga's Farmville game had 82 million daily users, making Zynga the most popular social gaming company since 2009. Yet, thanks to the success of games such as Candy Crush Saga, London-based King has overtaken Zynga to take the top spot. It now has 14 million more users playing its games a day than Zynga . Candy Crush now has 9 million daily Facebook users. 69% of Candy Crush Saga players are women, and 300,000 of them are called Maria . The figures come from game-maker Zynga's . most recent earnings call. The team behind Farmville now sits in second place with 52 million daily players. King's success is being attributed to the storming success of its Candy Crush Saga game. Candy Crush is the most popular game on Facebook and was the most downloaded game on iOS and Android in March and April. It's also currently the third most popular free app on the Play store, behind behemoths Facebook and Whataspp Messenger. The aim of Candy Crush Saga is to match three of more sweets in a row to make them disappear. You can create super sweets that can help you clear the board faster. Cleared sweets appear in a candy cane at the side of the screen and you progress to the next level when the candy cane gets full. Candy Crush is made by King and can be played on its website, as well as on Facebook. Games can be synced, too, so you can start on one platform and continue on another. The game was launched on mobile in November 2012 and became number one within six months, including 10 million downloads in December 2012 alone. Since the game launched, Candy Crush Saga players have spent the equivalent of 103,000 years playing the game. And over 1 trillion candies have been crushed, which is more than the stars in the Milky Way. Since 2011, Angry Birds by Rovio has stormed the mobile app charts, along with Imangi's Temple Run. Zynga's Farmville became a Facebook phenomenon in 2009. Yet Candy Crush is now more popular than these games across multiple platforms. Rovio's Angry Birds game has consistently topped the game app charts since it launched in 2009. However, King's Candy Crush Saga has now overtaken Angry Birds to take the top spot on Facebook, iOS and Android, and its success has made London-based owner King.com the most popular social gaming developer across the world . Riccardo Zacconi is head of King. He calls the game a 'perfect time-killer' and told The Sun: 'The mass appeal of Candy Crush is easy to understand. You can play immediately, it's easy to pick up, doesn't take ages to learn and is intuitive.' Although the app is free, the game has cash incentives that help players progress through the game. Once a player loses five lives they become locked out of the game for half an hour. Players can pay 69p to start playing immediately. Buying a lollipop hammer removes chosen sweets and hammers costs £1.49. If you want to eliminate an entire row, you can pay £27.99. Create rows or columns with three or more sweets of the same colour to remove them. You can also create super sweets by combining four or five candies. Super sweets give you added bonuses, . for example the Striped Candy can remove an entire row or column of . sweets when it's matched. The Wrapped Candy is created when you . match five sweets in a L- or T-shape. This means that you make two . combinations of three sweets in each (one vertical and one horizontal), . where the switched candy is part of both combinations at once. The Wrapped Candy is a bomb, blowing up all sweets around it when it is matched. The Colour Candy is created when five candies form a straight line. This special sweet cannot be matched but you can activate it by switch it with another sweet. All sweets of the same colour as the one you switched it with will be removed. Special sweets can also be combined; . Two Striped Candies will remove one row and a column, two Wrapped . candies will make a bigger blast, while two Colour Candies will remove . all sweets at once with an All Clear effect. Combine a Striped Candy with a Wrapped Candy to create a Mega-Candy. Mega-Candies will remove three rows and three columns. Combine a Striped Candy with a Colour Candy to create a Super Stripe. The Super Stripe will create striped . candies of all candies of the same colour as the original striped candy . in the combination. For example, if you combine a yellow Striped Candy and a Colour Candy, all yellow sweets will become striped and detonate. You proceed to the next level when you have filled the candy cane to the left by crushing candy. All special sweets will follow you to the next level. When the time is up, all your special sweets will detonate in the Sugar Crush, giving you bonus points. Alternatively, players can ask other . players and Facebook friends to help them progress through levels using . bonuses and point sharing. Zacconi claims that more than 90 per . cent of users who finish Candy Crush do so with help from friends, or by . themselves, and don't need to buy extras and help. According to market research from App Annie, Candy Crush is not just popular, it's a money-maker too. It is the top grossing game, meaning it has the highest revenues in the UK, the US and other territories for the iPhone, iPad and Android. Alex Dale, the chief marketing . officer of King told The Telegraph: 'This is a very competitive business,' he says. 'There are hundreds of thousands of . games out there. We need to be constantly evolving. If you look at games . like Tetris, it has been going for more than 20 years.'","The match-three game now has more than 15 million daily Facebook users worldwide .

"Sony emails leaked on Friday reveal the tumultuous relationship between Sony Chair Amy Pascal and writer Aaron Sorkin. In fact, after one tense exchange between the two over what screenplay he would work on next for the studio, Pascal emails a few of her fellow executives saying that Sorkin is 'broke' and implies he is 'sleeping with' the author of a new book he wants to adapt into a screenplay. That author is Molly Bloom, the poker princess who was busted by the Feds after hosting games that included Hollywood A-listers such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Tobey Maguire, men she all name checked in her novel Molly's Game . Scroll down for video . Professional spat: New emails reveal that Aaron Sorkin (above) and Amy pascal were at odds over what film the writer would adapt next for the studio . Get it done: Pascal (above) wanted Sorkin to adapt the film Flash Boys, while he went ahead and decided to work on a script based on the book Molly's Game . Tirade: After she learned of Sorkin's plan, Pascal lashed out in an email, saying he was 'broke' and implying he was sleeping with the author of the book, Molly Bloom (above) The problems between Pascal and Sorkin, who has a long history with the studio after writing The Social Network, Moneyball and the  upcoming film Jobs for Sony, seem to stem from the fact that he does not want to write the script Pascal would like him to. The emails, obtained by Defamer, show that Pascal wants Sorkin to adapt the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt for the studio, while he would rather work on Molly's Game. Sorkin's major problems with Flash Boys, according to his emails, are that there is little plot and the main character is Asian and 'there aren't any Asian movie stars.' Making matters worse is that the Jobs film, for which he wrote the screenplay, was falling apart at the same time, with director David Fincher dropping out and DiCaprio and Christian Bale refusing to star. Sorkin, as revealed in previously leaked emails, was also upset that Michael Fassbender had been given the title role. What angers Pascal is when Sorkin's agent, Ari Emanuel, emails to say the writer will be passing on Flash Boys in favor of adapting Molly's Game - and shopping it to other studios. That email came on November 13, one day after Deadline broke news of the story. This after Sorkin was apparently paid for Flash Boys, and the studio gave him millions for his Jobs screenplay. That is when Pascal emailed Doug Belgrad, president of Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, as well as Michael De Luca and Hannah Minghella, the co-presidents of production at Columbia. She wrote; 'He is broke… He wants to get paid… We paid him his insane fee on flashboys… When the poker movie came around we didn’t want to not be in Aaron business so we wanted that too… I don’t care if Aaron is sleeping with the girl or not… I don’t care if it becomes a beat seller… They are treating us like sh*t.' The way they were: Sorkin and Pascal are close as he has written numerous screenplays for the studio, including The Social Network and Moneyball . The timing of this email release could not be worse for Pascal, as Sorkin just voiced his support for the studio head. 'Amy knows more than a lot of people what it's like to battle stereotypes. She's a woman at a large corporation who worked her way from assistant to the chairman's office,' Sorkin told The Hollywood Reporter. 'No one in the world feels worse than she does right now, and the thing about Amy's character is that it's not because she was caught, it's because she did it. 'Amy would rather cut off her own hand than intentionally hurt someone.' Pascal has yet to comment on this latest leak.","In new emails leaked in the Sony hack, Amy Pascal attacks Aaron Sorkin after  the writer ignores her request to adapt a film for the studio .

"A little girl who had to have both her legs and an arm amputated after contracting meningitis is able walk thanks to a new pair of legs. Ellie-Mae Mellor, seven, has taken her first steps after losing three limbs to the deadly bug meningococcal septicaemia as a baby. Doctors told devastated parents, Kelly and Billy, that Ellie-Mae would die after she was rushed into hospital days before her first birthday - and even advised them to organise the last rites for their daughter. Survivor: After 76 operations, seven-year-old Ellie-Mae has learned to walk on a pair of 'rocking' legs. She caught meningitis just before her first birthday and lost both her legs and an arm . But as the infection took hold, battling Ellie-Mae, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, stunned them all by getting stronger each day. She has since undergone 76 operations including three amputations. And now, after years of hospital appointments and risky surgeries, the schoolgirl has learned to walk on brand new legs - and she has vowed to complete a sponsored walk to raise money for her local school church. Kelly, 34, said: 'I am so proud of my daughter. Ellie-Mae always has a smile on her face. 'She was so young when she got meningitis that she hadn't learned to walk at all - so she doesn't know any different. Ellie-Mae was a healthy baby before she caught meningitis just before her first birthday. Within hours of being infected she was displaying symptoms including a bright purple rash . 'Ellie-Mae never grumbles or complains, she doesn't see herself as any different to her friends, and does everything they do. 'When doctors told me they needed to amputate, I didn't think twice about giving them permission. I just wanted them to do whatever it took to save my little girl. Ellie hasn't been able to use prosthetic legs up until now, as she has been growing so quickly, but she has learned to walk on a pair of 'rocking' legs, which she can walk about on really easily.' Lunchtime supervisor Kelly rushed . Ellie-Mae to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire after she . developed a small red bruise on her head, three days before her first . birthday, in February 2007. Doctors were forced to amputate three limbs because of blood poisoning caused by meningitis. Her mother Kelly said that she didn't care that her baby needed the surgery because she just wanted her to survive . But within hours, the little girl was covered from head to toe in a purple rash - and medics didn't believe she would pull survive. Kelly said: 'I could see how seriously ill Ellie-Mae was straight away, as the doctors were running around her frantically. 'When they said she had meningitis, I went numb. They told me I should let her have the last rites, as she probably wouldn't last the night. Ellie-Mae never grumbles or complains about her disability, and doesn't see herself as any different to her friends (such as pals Leah and Owen Rigby, pictured). Her school makes sure she is included in all activities too . 'We had Ellie-Mae baptised, but we refused to let her have the last rites - it felt like we would have been giving up on her. 'I don't remember feeling anything. I couldn't believe this was happening to my daughter. 'I couldn't prepare myself to lose her, but by the next day, she was still fighting. 'Doctors did everything they could to fight the infection, but they said pretty soon they would have to amputate one of her legs and her arm. 'I didn't care, as long as she was alive.' Mother Kelly (pictured) said that she is exceptionally proud of her daughter who now plans to do a sponsored walk to raise £250 to repair her school roof . Ellie-Mae was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital in March, before being allowed home in July. Ellie Mae (pictured before meningitis) has always been a 'smiley child' But just days later, she was taken back into hospital, after the bone in her remaining leg had 'died' - and doctors were forced to amputate it. As Ellie-Mae grew, she has had to endure dozens of painful operations. But despite everything she has been through, Ellie-Mae is still determined to help others - and told her parents that she wanted to complete a sponsored walk with her friend, Leah Rigby, to raise money to repair the roof at the church attached to her school. Ellie-Mae said: 'I wanted to do it so we could help with the church roof, I am looking forward to it. It will be a challenge.'Kelly added: 'The school and the church have done so much for her and we wanted to say thank you. 'Nothing has been too much trouble. They make sure she can take part in activities and school trips. 'It is a fantastic idea, I know hundreds of people do sponsored walks but the difference is Ellie-Mae has no legs. 'It will be a massive challenge, I am immensely proud. She has been through so much yet she has always got a smile on her face and never lets anything get her down. 'And the fact that she is doing this to help other people, well, we couldn't ask for anything better from her.' Ellie-Mae, who hopes to raise £250, added: 'Even if we could just help a little bit towards it that would be great.' Just a typical girl: Ellie-Mae enjoys playing with her dollhouse when she isn't doing selfless charity work. She said: 'I wanted to do [the walk] so we could help with the church roof, I am looking forward to it. It will be a challenge' Ian Beardmore, headteacher of St Mary's Catholic Primary School, in Stoke, Staffs, said: 'The church roof is in desperate need of funds. If these funds are not raised the church would have to close. 'I remember sitting in a room with about 15 professionals, each of them said that Ellie was unlikely to be able to move her torso, let alone walk. 'The fact that Ellie is now going to be doing a sponsored walk to say thank you to our school and church is nothing less than a miracle. 'She has added so much to our community and I honestly feel that she is the most inspirational and determined child I have ever met.' Church members launched a £130,000 appeal this month to replace the roof after metal thieves targeted the building. So far £25,000 has been donated to the cause, which must be completed before the summer ends or the church may have to close for good.

"A stripper who worked for the nightclub owner that shot President Kennedy's killer has now claimed that her boss was not part of a bigger conspiracy. For the 50 years since JFK's assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963, a range of wild stories have suggested that any number of masterminds behind the assassination and alleged cover up- from Kennedy's vice President Lyndon Johnson or his long time rival Richard Nixon or mob bosses and international gangsters. Tammi True, who worked as a stripper at the time, has now opened up about how she believes that her then-boss Jack Ruby was acting on his own accord when he shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald. Scroll down for video . The moment: Nightclub owner Jack Ruby (in the hat at right) shot and killed Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald when he was being transferred from the Dallas police station to a nearby jail two days after killing the president . Fatal ride: Oswald shot and killed President Kennedy as he drove through Dallas on November 22 . 'Jack did it because he had the opportunity,' Ms True said. 'There were a lot of people who wanted to do what Jack did.' The moment he fatally shot Oswald inside the Dallas police office was caught on film, meaning that there was no way to argue he was guilty. Instead, the big question became why did he kill the man who crippled the country? At the time, there were investigations into whether Ruby was pressured to kill Oswald in order to shut him up and keep him from revealing the true motivations behind the assassination. The man she knew: Tammi True (right) worked in one of Ruby's (left) Dallas clubs in 1963 . Still in the spotlight: Ms True (pictured in 2011), who is now 75, is featured in an upcoming film about the Kennedy assassination called 'True Tales' Telling her story: 'True Tales' is the latest in a number of movies and documentaries to come out this year in honor of the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death . Ms True, who is now 75-years-old, is featured in an upcoming film called True Tales, where she gives insight into Ruby and his possible motivations. She said that there was no way that his killing of Oswald was planned because he overslept that morning. The Dallas Star Telegram reports that Ms True said Ruby was headed to wire money to another stripper with his dachshund in tow once he finally got out of bed. Watch more of the interview with Tammi True here. Big man: Ruby, seen here with two of his dancers in front of his Carousel Club, has been the subject of a number of conspiracy theories as many believe that he killed Oswald to keep him from confessing about a larger plan . Way with the wings: The involvement of Ruby brought the darker underbelly of his clubs and mob connections into question . It was just a matter of timing, she said, that led Ruby to cross paths with Oswald as he was being escorted by police at the station. Even if that is the case, there was some level of undisputed planning that went into it as Ruby had to make his way to the basement of the police station and jumped out from behind a crowd of reporters in order to fatally shoot Oswald in the stomach. Many of the reporters were filming live so millions of Americans saw the shooting happen in real time.","Nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald two days after Oswald shot the President .

"England suffered a hat-trick of heartbreaks after defeat to Jamaica denied them Commonwealth Games bronze. A day after blowing their chances of making the gold medal match for the first time in the dying seconds against New Zealand, Anna Mayes' side went down 52-48 at the SSE Hydro to miss out on a medal. This match also looked set to go to the wire with the scores level at 37-37 going into the final quarter, but England's level dropped when it mattered most as they slipped from 48-47 behind to 51-47 down and from that point there was no way back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Glasgow a 'stand-out Games' - Hooper . Ecstatic: Jamaica's netball team celebrate beating England in their Commonwealth Games bronze match . At least there was no individual mistake in the final seconds to look back on, as there had been against the Silver Ferns and, in the pool stage, against Australia. Both of those matches were lost by a single point. This time England, bronze medallists at the last two Commonwealths, were just not good enough. Kadeen Corbin, whose error proved so costly against New Zealand, responded with 22 goals from 26 attempts, while Jo Harten scored 26 from 29, but it was Romelda Aiken's 44 from 52 for Jamaica, including 15 in the final quarter, which proved invaluable. Bruising encounter: England's Joanne Harten (centre) gets pressured by Jamaica's defence . 'Today we didn't bring it,' said goalkeeper Geva Mentor, who was left battered and bruised by a physical contest. 'Jamaica were the best team on the day, they held strong all the way through and withstood the pressure we kept applying, but we didn't capitalise when we did get that ball. 'It was very physical, you can tell that from my fat lip and I've got a shiner coming up as well. It's a shame the umpires can't see the retaliation, but we just have to withstand that. We have to be quick enough and skilful enough to be able to lose the body so we don't get caught in the face. 'Yesterday's was definitely (harder to swallow). I'm not even upset, I think it just sums up this tournament for me. Anger will probably start to set in and a few different emotions, but at the moment I am pretty emotionless.' On the ball: England's Eboni Beckford-Chambers looks to pass to a team-mate against Jamaica . Jamaican were well-beaten 57-42 in their semi-final by the Australia team England ran so close, but made changes for Sunday's clash and they worked. England led 13-11 after the first quarter, trailed 25-24 at halfway and were back level at the end of the third period as the momentum swung from one side to the other. That run of three unanswered goals in the final period left England with too much to do, though, and had the Jamaican substitutes celebrating at the side of the court as the clock counted down. Golden girls: Australia are the 2014 Commonwealth Games netball champions after beating New Zealand . Mayes said: 'I think we were a little bit tentative, a little bit nervous, especially in that first half. We did wear them down defensively, but we just weren't clinical enough when we needed to be. 'They fed Romelda well, they converted when they needed to and she rebounded well when she missed, so that was difficult.' Australia ended New Zealand's reign as Commonwealth champions by claiming gold with a convincing 58-40 win in the final.

"Frank Lampard is set for an emotional return to Stamford Bridge in January after it was confirmed that the Chelsea legend will stay at Manchester City longer than expected.

Lampard was due to report for pre-season training in January at the end of his six-month ‘loan’ but will now stay in England until February. New York kick off their first Major League Soccer season in March. The move would benefit both teams with Manuel Pellegrini holding on to an experienced player at a time when Yaya Toure is away at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Lampard will be in peak condition when he joins his new club. Lampard is expected to make his third appearance for City on Wednesday when they begin their defence of the Capital One Cup at home to Sheffield Wednesday. Speaking yesterday before club sources confirmed that Lampard will stay until February, Pellegrini refused to be drawn on the issue. ‘I can’t answer that,’ he said. ‘ In January, we will see what happens here and make a decision. It is not a problem at this moment.’ Lampard has been held up as an example for Chelsea’s second string to follow in their Capital One Cup tie against Bolton on Wednesday. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will make a host of changes to his line-up — Ramires is out with a groin strain — and his assistant Steve Holland has told those selected to approach the Bolton game in the manner of Lampard, who spent a trophy-laden 14 years at Stamford Bridge. ‘Without going over the top on Frank Lampard, because he is no longer a Chelsea player, whenever he played in the Capital One Cup against League One and League Two opposition, he played the game as though it was the World Cup final,’ said Holland. ‘Maybe that’s why he’s had the career he has had. And I would suggest that is probably a good line for others to follow. Manuel Pellegrini managed to salvage a point for Manchester City against Chelsea at the Etihad .

The 36-year-old Frank Lampard holds his hands up and looks to the skies after scoring against Chelsea . ‘Motivation shouldn’t be a problem.

His replacement Willy Caballero is expected to stay in goal for Saturday’s trip to Hull after waiting patiently since playing in the Community Shield defeat by Arsenal last month. ‘Willy Caballero will have one or two games in a row because he’s a keeper and needs to play,’ said Pellegrini. City want Hart and James Milner to sign new contracts, but Milner is reluctant to commit his future to the club until he knows if he will be offered enough first-team football. Manuel Pellegrini is not worried about going four games without a win after the Chelsea 1-1 draw . The England midfielder set up Lampard’s goal against Chelsea, but said: ‘That was my second start of the season. I just want a fair crack of the whip. ‘I would love to stay at Manchester City but first and foremost I am a footballer and want to play football. When you’re not playing it’s frustrating.’ City have spoken to Greater Manchester Police about security issues surrounding next week’s Champions League clash with Roma at the Etihad. The Italian club’s fans clashed with Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford in 2007, resulting in 21 arrests, and there were more ugly scenes when they played CSKA Moscow in Rome last week. Around 2,000 Roma fans will travel to Manchester.

"Leicester have vowed to safeguard Geoff Parling’s long-term health as they seek urgent specialist advice for the England lock after the latest in a worrying series of concussion setbacks. The 30-year-old was helped off during the second half of his club’s record 45-0 defeat at Bath on Saturday having apparently suffered another damaging blow to the head. The Tigers have concerns and doubts about his future playing prospects, but the player’s personal welfare is undoubtedly their priority. Leicester Tigers are having fears over Geoff Parling's career after suffering from multiple concussions . Leicester's Parling, aged 30, has had ongoing issues with concussion . Parling has suffered head trauma several times in the past year and this latest episode comes just weeks after a similar injury in a pre-season match against Edinburgh. Concussion has become a huge issue for rugby and many other sports and Leicester are not going to take any chances, despite the prospect of losing an experienced Lion, who started two of England’s Tests in New Zealand in June, for an indeterminate period. Leicester director rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘He got concussed in Edinburgh, had three weeks off, played against Cardiff, was good, then played against Exeter and got a bang on the head again versus Bath, so that’s two concussions in three games. ‘We’re waiting for advice from the specialist but he won’t be fit this week and he may need some down-time because he’s had consecutive concussions very quickly and clearly that’s not healthy. ‘It is a concern for his health. Playing is secondary. He had a concussion in the Six Nations, he had a concussion at the end of the season and now he’s had two in very quick succession in pre-season and at the start of the season. The bigger picture is Geoff’s well-being more than playing.’ Asked if there are any fears that Parling may not be able to carry on playing, Cockerill added: ‘I don’t know the answer to that. You would like to think that with the right rest and expertise, he will be fine, but I don’t know. ‘He is doing the usual cognition protocols and everything else they do. He’s going to see the right people. He came in yesterday and feels OK in himself but for all the right reasons we have to go through all the right protocols. I don’t want any of our players out there with potential brain injuries from concussions or whatever it may be because that’s not right. ‘I need Geoff on the field but not to the detriment of his long-term health. If he needs a few weeks because that’s the right thing to do to get over this problem then we need to do that. There are some times when it’s only a game.’ Concussion has been the subject of increased awareness and improving medical procedures since Wallaby flanker George Smith’s swift return to the field against the Lions last summer — following a clash of heads with Richard Hibbard — exposed concerns about the management of head injuries. Several years ago, New Zealand captain Richie McCaw was able to downplay his own repeat concussion problems, but now all cases are being treated with due care and caution. Tom Youngs will be out for the next three months after undergoing shoulder surgery . Youngs will not be fit to face New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia in November . The uncertainty over Parling’s health and hopes of making a comeback have added to Leicester’s injury crisis. Cockerill is without a multitude of leading players and yesterday he revealed that Tom Youngs will join the mounting casualty list. The England hooker is expected to be out until Christmas after having surgery on the shoulder he damaged in the drubbing at The Rec. ‘Tom Youngs has popped his AC joint and has had surgery on it yesterday,’ said Cockerill. ‘He is probably going to be out for three months. He carried the ball, Dave Attwood fell on him, he just got caught awkwardly and his AC popped out. ‘When you get separation between that and your shoulder joint, it has to be fixed. The collarbone just pops out at the top. If it’s stable, it just needs rest but if it’s a bit unstable then they wire it so it stays in position. It heals over time … three months’ time. ‘It’s disappointing because Tommy is a world-class player and he gives you great impact either off the bench or starting. We’ve already got three front-rowers missing and now Tommy is out too.’ The Tigers were also without Manu Tuilagi last weekend but hope the England centre will be fit to return from a groin strain against Gloucester at Kingsholm on October 4. The IRB’s revised directives, headed ‘recognise and remove’, list the symptoms of concussion as ‘convulsive, headache, knocked out, nauseous, unsteady, confused, dazed, dizzy’ followed by the clear message: ‘Any of these — get them off NOW.’ The full IRB guidance suggests these ‘six Rs’: ‘Recognise, remove, refer, rest, recover, return.’ All players diagnosed with concussion by ‘an appropriately qualified person’ must be removed from the field of play and not return to play or train on the same day, and complete the graduated return to play protocol.","Geoff Parling has suffered two concussions in three games .

"Prince Harry finally got the chance to celebrate his 30th birthday last night - with a black tie party featuring singer Ellie Goulding. With his father, Prince Charles, and step-mother, the Duchess of Cornwall, on holiday in Scotland, the party-loving prince was given the run of their London residence, Clarence House. The birthday boy drove himself in through the rear entrance to the house at 7.20pm with his protection officer by his side in the top-of-the-range Audi. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry, left, celebrated his 30th birthday with a black-tie event featuring Ellie Goulding, right . But it was unlikely, given Harry’s fondness for a good time, that he would be driving himself home to Kensington Palace again. His brother, Prince William, arrived shortly afterwards, also driving himself in a brand new Range Rover. He did not appear to be accompanied by his pregnant wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, however, who has been suffering from severe ante-natal sickness. Most of Harry’s guests drove up through the gates in their car, pressing a printed invitation with a cypher on the top up against the window to a waiting police office for identification. Several arrived by foot, however, wearing a mixture of suits and tuxedos and evening dresses. Singer Ellie Goulding - who performed at William and Kate’s wedding reception - was said to be playing at the bash. The Prince of Wales allowed Prince Harry to use Clarence House to host the star-studded bash . Sources said she would be singing an ‘intimate acoustic’ set of some of her best-known hits, such as Lights and Burn, as well as a few special requests from Harry. The pair have become firm friends, with the pair hugging and posing for photographs backstage at the closing concert of the prince’s Invictus Games on Sunday. On Monday night - which was Harry’s actual birthday - Ellie tweeted a picture of a sunset and wrote:’Gorgeous sunset tonight. Happy Birthday H.’ Rumours that Harry was having a ski resort-themed party at Kensington Palace organised by Kate and her former party-planner sister, Pippa Middleton, at the weekend appear to have been wide of the mark. But the party was still a well-deserved pat on the back for Harry after the phenomenal success of the Invictus Games, his Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen which could be rolled out worldwide.","Prince Harry was given Clarence House for the night by Prince Charles .

"Europe captain Paul McGinley has lined up former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to speak at the team dinner at Gleneagles on Tuesday evening. Ferguson is a friend of assistant captain Sam Torrance, and turned up to watch the European team practice on Tuesday morning. His presence continues a recent tradition of star performers from other sports saying a few words in the team room. Four years ago it was Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards while Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola spoke at Medinah last time. McGinley said last week that he had lined up someone of similar stature and Ferguson certainly fits the bill. He has turned up at a number of Scottish events on the European Tour over the years and is believed to play to a handicap of 18.

Kaymer then has a chuckle to himself and carries on hitting balls after jokingly giving the 'friendly' wave to his rivals . Where were you when they took the decision to cancel the 2001 Ryder Cup? I was in a small Canadian outpost that had a Walmart, a nine-hole golf course, a Holiday Inn and ...er, that was about it. We had been diverted there on September 11. For five days we walked the course, wandered the supermarket and gathered each evening in the hotel bar where the New York-based flight crew sang karaoke songs about their home town against the backdrop of those sad, horrific images of 9/11 playing out on the television. Some good came out of it from a golf point of view. When the match was played the following year, it ushered in an era of respectfulness that has been a feature of every Ryder Cup since. 'He's a guy that I played with in the JP McManus pro-am about 15 years ago and that I've seen now and again over that time, and when I became captain I asked him,' McGinley said of Ferguson. 'Of course he was more than willing to help. But the one thing he asked me to do was keep it really quiet. Walking around (the course) is not keeping it quiet, is it? We wanted a bit of a surprise for the players but I guess it's not a surprise.' West Ham fan McGinley joked that Ferguson would not be giving any of his team the famous 'hairdryer' treatment, with the Hammers coincidentally making the trip to Old Trafford on Saturday. 'Although I'm a West Ham fan, I've always loved the way his teams played and there's a number of things that he's dealing with that he was particularly good at that I think he'll be a particularly strong fit,' McGinley added. 'He's asked me a lot of questions and I know he's very keen and looking forward to tonight. He's a big fan of golf, as we know. He knows Rory (McIlroy) very well and Rory is a big Man Utd fan. Not everybody in the room is a Man Utd fan, so that should be a bit fun. 'This is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them. He's very aware of that. This is relaxed. This is a conversation. There will be questions coming back at him. 'They all love football and a chance to spend a bit of time with one of the greats in soccer doesn't come around very often, particularly with somebody they all admire. In my dealings with him, he's been absolutely fantastic and I know he'll be great with the players.'

McIlroy and McDowell have been regular partners in team events since 2009, winning three of their four matches in the Seve Trophy and also representing Ireland in the World Cup that year and 2011.

However, European captain McGinley said on Monday that their record of two wins, three losses and one half from those six matches meant they were not a formidable pairing 'written in stone', and Tuesday's practice line-up offered hints about possible alternative partnerships. With the 12-man team split up into four groups of three, McIlroy was alongside Medinah hero Martin Kaymer and Spain's Sergio Garcia, with McDowell alongside France's Victor Dubuisson and Sweden's Henrik Stenson. It was no surprise to see good friends Justin Rose and Ian Poulter in the same group with local favourite Stephen Gallacher, with Thomas Bjorn, Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson making up the other threesome.

"Nick Herbert who has called for the UK to leave the jurisdiction of the ECHR . A former minister called on Britain to quit the European Court of Human Rights yesterday as the Government made its latest attempt to calm the bitter row over prisoner votes. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling published a draft bill containing three options for resolving the UK’s stand-off with Strasbourg. These were giving votes to inmates who have been jailed for up to four years, for up to six months or, crucially, maintaining the UK’s existing blanket ban. Mr Grayling is establishing a joint committee of MPs and peers to scrutinise each of the proposals – a move which could delay the decision until 2014. But Nick Herbert, who stood down as justice minister in September, said the draft bill would ‘merely kick the can down the street’. The Tory MP called for decisive action to ‘end the writ of the European Court’. He said: ‘That would enable Parliament and our own courts to strike a proper balance between rights and responsibilities, with respect for the democratic will. ‘We shouldn’t defy the European Court of Human Rights – we should resign from it altogether.’ Britain is free to walk away from the court, provided it gives six months’ notice. However, it would provoke howls of protests from the Lib Dems. The Government had been given until today by Strasbourg to respond to a 2005 ruling that it is unlawful to ban all convicted prisoners from voting. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling makes a statement to the House of Commons about proposals on prisoner voting, including the option of retaining the ban . The Government had been given until today by Strasbourg to respond to a 2005 ruling that it is unlawful to ban all convicted prisoners from voting . David Cameron and a string of senior . ministers have made plain their disgust at the idea of giving rapists, . murderers and robbers the vote. Mr Grayling is hoping to end the stand-off – or at least buy more time – by giving MPs a fresh vote. But some MPs fear Strasbourg will not . be satisfied and will order Britain to make compensation payouts to . inmates who claim their ‘human rights’ have been breached. An estimated 3,000 prisoners are lining-up to claim a windfall from the taxpayer of around £1,000 each. In a Commons statement, Mr Grayling . suggested he could block prisoners getting access to legal aid to help . them mount their legal challenges. However . MPs fear that will not prove a deterrent to ‘ambulance chasing’ lawyers . who are prepared to offer services on a no-win, no-fee basis. Labour . said it did not want any inmates to have the vote. But it was . immediately clear the Coalition is split over the issue. Lord McNally, a . Liberal Democrat justice minister, indicated he is in favour. Dominic Grieve, the Tory Attorney General, has himself warned Britain could become a ‘pariah’ if it does not obey Strasbourg. He has warned senior ministers that they must abstain when the crucial vote takes place or risk angering the European court. In the Commons, Tory MP Robert Halfon said the European Convention on Human Rights was drafted to ensure that the horrors of Nazi Germany could not be repeated. He added: ‘It was never the intention of the framers to give Albert Speer and Rudolf Hess the vote.’ Fellow backbencher Peter Bone applauded Mr Grayling for seeking to make ‘this Parliament sovereign and ignoring a Mickey Mouse court in Europe’. However, the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Commissioner made it clear the court was in no mood to tolerate further delays. Nils Muiznieks said: ‘It’s been seven years since the initial judgment, so a long time has passed since the ruling and the Government has asked for extensions, so we would like to see the judgment implemented. 'The UK decided to delegate some small part of its sovereignty to the Council of Europe when it joined and when it agreed to abide by the rulings of the court.’ The committee is expected to begin examining the options next year, a process that could take a year or more. The Euro court is expected to meet early next month to decide its formal response to the draft bill.","Nick Herbert says draft bill attempting to resolve row will just 'kick the can down the street'

"Real Madrid are the star attraction in Tuesday night's Uefa Super Cup final in Cardiff, but what about opponents Sevilla? Sportsmail gives you the lowdown. How do we sum up Sevilla? Character and characters. Always well supported by wonderfully loud fans who belt out the Sevilla anthem and do a superb Poznan, Sevilla were boisterously led for 11 years by president Jose Maria del Nido until he was sentenced to seven years in prison for his part in a municipal embezzlement scandal. His replacement Jose Castro is a more low-key leader but the club still do their best to shake up the big two. A trip to their concrete bowl Sanchez Pizjuan stadium is normally not one that Real Madrid relish and back in 2007 under Juande Ramos they even stayed in the title race until the last weekend of the season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bale focused on the game despite returning 'back home' Triumph: Sevilla won the Europa League last season with a penalty shootout win over Benfica . Celebrate: Kevin Gameiro's winning penalty sends Sevilla players wild back in May . VIDEO Sevilla set for Real Super Cup challenge . As Uefa Cup winners that year they qualified for the European Super Cup but on August 28, their 22-year-old midfielder Antonio Puerta died having not recovered from a heart attack suffered on the pitch in a match against Getafe. Sevilla wanted the Super Cup final against Carlo Ancelotti’s Milan cancelled but it was played two days after his funeral and they lost 3-1. The dignity with which they still honour their former player is a credit to the club and the supporters – expect Puerta’s name to be sung in Cardiff. So class off the pitch... and pedigree on it, despite the underdog status? They’ve won seven cups (including the Europa League three times) since 2000 so yes they’ve got something about them. Madrid will do well to take nothing for granted then? Sevilla in their pomp – with Jesus Navas and Dani Alves hurtling down the right wing together and Freddie Kanoute and Luis ‘El Fabuloso’ Fabiano converting the crosses, were a match for anyone, Real Madrid included. But financial restraints have made it ever more difficult to compete. Prized asset: Jesus Navas moved from Sevilla to Manchester City in the summer of 2013 . Selling club: Ivan Rakitic was the latest star to leave Sevilla, this time for Barcelona this summer . A selling club? That’s putting it mildly. From Alves and Seydou Keita to Barcelona in 2008 it’s been an annual exodus. They sold Alvaro Negredo, Navas and Gary Medel last year and this year it’s Ivan Rakitic. The best player nearly always leaves at the end of the season. So how did the win the Europa League last season having sold their stars? Their manic coach Unai Emery is one of the best in Spain. His intensive man-management style can be draining for the players but they love him because he gets results. Crouching, gesticulating, grimacing and just generally bobbing up and down in his technical area he sweats as much as some of his players. With limited resources he has done well throughout his career. And on the pitch? They still have talent. Colombian striker and former bus conductor Carlos Bacca scored 21 goals in his first season last year and is still leading the line despite interest from Atletico Madrid. Portuguese keeper Beto was exceptional in the Europa League final. Alberto Moreno is wanted by Liverpool and Iago Aspas has arrived from Liverpool with plenty to prove after last season’s disappointment. Man at the helm: Coach Unai Emery is intensive and manic, but has led Sevilla to success . Star: Carlos Bacca scored 21 goals in his first season with Sevilla, and attracted interest from Atletico Madrid . And if Moreno and Bacca play well they could join Rakitic through the door? They will keep Bacca, and coach Emery has said of Moreno: 'He is very much part of our plans. I think he will still be here with us when the window closes.' How do they play? Probably 4-3-2-1 with the Argentines Nico Pareja and Fazio in the centre of defefence, Koke at right back, and Moreno as a very attacking left-back. Jose Antonio Reyes should start next to Denis Suarez, the former Manchester City kid signed from Barca B, and Vitolo, in a line of three behind Bacca. Do they have a chance? With fewer players having come back late after playing in the World Cup they should be fitter than Madrid. But when Real tire Carlo Ancelotti will have around 100m euros worth of talent on the bench to freshen things up. It will be very difficult.

"A former professional rugby player said to have started the deadly NekNominate craze which has claimed three lives in Britain said 'it has gone too far'.

Following the tragedies, scrum half Mr Samson told the Irish Sunday Mirror that he no longer wants to be associated with it at all. 'It has gone too far. This was not how it was supposed to go. The . game started last year but I happened to do one at Christmas that got a . lot of attention on my Facebook. It just snowballed,' he told Gemma Aldridge at the newspaper.

In a debate in the European Parliament, Mr Agnew, who represents the Eastern region, admitted that he is not a father and blamed sexism and poor childcare for preventing mothers reaching the top. Ukip MEP Stuart Agnew claimed women lose ambition when babies get in the way . Mr Agnew said: 'If you look at the people who get degrees more, women get them and they are getting the jobs in the work place, but for various reasons, they don't have the ambition to go right to the top because something gets in the way. It's called a baby. 'I have never had a baby, but I understand that if you do have a baby it can change your life and it changes your ambitions. 'So, the route is there. Those females who really want to get to the top do so.' He made the comments during a debate on Tuesday about gender quotas. Godfrey Bloom resigned as a Ukip MEP after telling an audience at an event promoting women in politics that they were 'sluts' Richard Howitt, Labour's MEP for the Eastern region, branded Mr Agnew's comments 'outrageous'. He accused Mr Agnew of holding 'Neanderthal views about women. The comments are offensive and insulting.' Mr Agnew's comments come just two months after Godfrey Bloom MEP resigned the Ukip whip in the European Parliament after branded women in the party 'sluts' for failing to clean behind the fridge. Mr Bloom remains an independent MEP. Ukip leader Nigel Farage admitted last week that his party has in the past resembled a 'rugby club on a day out'. But he claimed that was turning around. 'In the early days, just didn't have many able women in the party, or able women who had the time to give to politics. That's changed completely and if you look at the European election list for next year, the women dominate it.' But Labour MEP Mary Honeyball condemned Agnew contested that view. She said: 'They reveal once again UKIP's prehistoric attitudes to women. UKIP is a party with no women as elected representatives, which will be running no female candidates anywhere in the East of England next time round. 'They have consistently - in both word and deed - committed to reduce the rights of women. Godfrey Bloom really was the tip of the iceberg. Mr Agnew defended his comments, issuing a statement saying: 'I was certainly not trying to suggest that all women who have babies don't make it to the top. Margaret Thatcher is an example that springs to mind.'","Stuart Agnew blamed sexism and poor childcare for women's failings .

"The 84-year-old was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison for 12 indecent assaults . Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service which sparked a mass brawl. The 84-year-old was targeted by another prisoner who shouted insults from the pews of the chapel at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire. Witnesses claim an inmate attempted to spit on the convicted paedophile but missed and hit another prisoner. The incident sparked an attack between the two convicts, who began throwing punches and had to be separated by officers. A . bystander told the Sun: ‘One prisoner called Rolf a dirty nonce and . spat at him.

"CERN's Large Hadron Collider will be turned back on in March - at double power, scientists revealed today. The world's biggest particle collider, located near Geneva, has been undergoing a two-year refit. Work is now 'in full swing' to start circulating proton beams again in March, with the first collisions due by May, the European Organization for Nuclear Research said. Scroll down for video . A worker stands below the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a general-purpose detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, during maintenance works. Deep below the border between Switzerland and France, the tunnel stretches out of sight, decked with silver installations fit for a starship . 'With this new energy level, the (collider) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries,' CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said in a statement. 'I'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us.' CERN's collider is buried in a 27-km (17-mile) tunnel straddling the Franco-Swiss border at the foot of the Jura mountains. The entire machine is already almost cooled to 1.9 degrees above absolute zero in preparation for the next three-year run. The first run, carried out at lower power, led in 2012 to confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson particle, which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets. That discovery was a landmark in physics but there are still plenty of other mysteries to be unraveled, including the nature of 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'. Latest calculations suggest that dark matter accounts for 27 percent of the universe and dark energy, which drives galaxies apart, 68 percent, while the visible matter observed in galaxies, stars and planets makes up just 5 percent. Scientists look at a section of the LHC while it is switched off. A year ago, the world's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science, identifying what is believed to be the Higgs Boson -- the long-sought maker of mass . Other unsolved questions include the relative lack of antimatter in the universe, when equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, and the possible existence of other new kinds of particles. Many physicists favor a yet-to-be-proven theory known as super-symmetry, in which all basic particles have a heavier but invisible 'super' partner. Getting to grips with such issues requires deeper insights into the building blocks of the cosmos, which researchers hope to achieve by turning up the dial at CERN to higher energies. 'We have unfinished business with understanding the universe,' said Tara Shears, a physics professor at the University of Liverpool, who works on one of the four main experiments at the collider. A worker walks past the Compact Muon Solenoid - part of the LHC. The 27 kilometre circular lab went offline in February for an 18-month overhaul. When experiments resume in 2015, scientists at CERN will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter, dark energy and supersymmetry . As engineers focus on the technical mission, physicists are sifting through the mountains of data that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has churned out since 2010, for there could be more nuggets to find. 'The things that are easy to spot have already been exploited, and now we're taking another look,' said Tiziano Camporesi of CERN, noting wryly that dealing with the unknown was, well, unknowable. 'We always say that astronomers have an easier task, because they can actually see what they're looking for!' The LHC's particle collisions transform energy into mass, the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe. At peak capacity, the 'old' LHC managed a mind-boggling 550 million collisions per second. 'We give the guys as many collisions as we can,' said Mike Lamont, head of its operating team. 'That's our bread and butter. Most of that stuff is not very interesting, so there are real challenges sorting out and throwing most of that away, and picking out the interesting stuff,' he explained in the tunnel, which mixes installations fit for a starship with the low-tech practicality of bicycles for inspection tours. CERN's supercomputers are programmed to identify within microseconds the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter. The LHC's computer screens are dark, but behind the scenes, work is pushing ahead to give the vast machine a mighty upgrade, enabling the collider to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther . 'We want to understand how that behaves, why it sticks itself together into tiny things that we call atoms and nuclei at really small scales, into things that we call people and chairs and buildings at bigger scales, and then planets and solar systems, galaxies at larger scales,' said CERN spokesman James Gillies. CERN's work can bemuse beginners, but the researchers find ways to make it simple. 'Everybody knows what an electron is, especially if they put their finger in an electric socket,' joked Pierluigi Campana, whose team has just provided the most exhaustive confirmation to date of the Standard Model, the chief theoretical framework of particle physics conceived in the 1970s. At peak capacity, the 'old' LHC managed a mind-boggling 550 million collisions per second. 'We give the guys as many collisions as we can,' said Mike Lamont, head of its operating team. Here, an engineer observes the Compact Muon Solenoid . They achieved the most accurate measurement yet of a change in a particle called a Bs, showing that out of every billion, only a handful decay into smaller particles called muon, and do so in pairs. For the experts, that finding was almost as thrilling as tracking the Higgs boson -- nicknamed the God Particle. It was theorised in 1964 by British physicist Peter Higgs and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others, such as light, have none. As engineers (pictured) focus on the technical mission, physicists are sifting through the mountains of data that the LHC has churned out since 2010, for there could be more nuggets to find . It is believed to act like a fork dipped . in syrup and held up in dusty air. While some dust slips through . cleanly, most gets sticky - in other words, acquires mass. With mass . comes gravity, which pulls particles together. The Standard Model is a trusty conceptual vehicle but it still lacks an explanation for gravity, nor does it account for dark matter and dark energy, which comprise most of the cosmos and whose existence is inferred from their impact on ordinary matter. Some physicists champion supersymmetry, the notion that there are novel particles which mirror each known particle. A worker rides his bike in a tunnel of the LHC. When it is back in business, the supercomputers are programmed to identify the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter . 'We have a theory that describes all the stuff around us, all the ordinary, visible matter that makes up the Universe. Except, the problem is, it doesn't. It makes up around five percent of the Universe,' said Gillies. The LHC replaced the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), which ran from 1989 to 2000. I . It came online in 2008, but ran into problems, forcing a year-long refit. The LHC's particle collisions transform energy into mass, the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe. Here a scientist gestures in front of a diagram of one of the many goings on at the LHC . It went on to reach a collision level of eight teraelectron volts (TeV) -- an energy measure -- compared to the LEP's 0.2 TeV. After the 50 million Swiss franc ($54-million, million-euro) upgrade, the target is 14 TeV, meaning bigger bangs and clearer snapshots. ''Every time we pass a significant amount of data collected, someone will find an excuse to open a bottle of champagne,' said physicist Joel Goldstein, glancing at a lab corner piled with empties.'We're going to run out of space eventually!' The particle was theorised in 1964 by British physicist Peter Higgs and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others, such as light, have none.

"Paedophile Rolf Harris has started sketching cartoons for fellow inmates in an attempt to win them over after he was handed a cushy prison gardening job, it has been claimed. The 84-year-old is reportedly handing out signed drawings to convicts  who  queue outside his cell at Bullingdon Prison, Oxfordshire in the hope of securing one of his sketches. One prisoner has claimed the entertainer turned down offers of cash for his drawings, according to The Sun while other inmates have dubbed the drawing sessions 'Rolf's Prison Cartoon Club' in reference to his 1990s television programme. Scroll down for video . Rolf Harris, pictured painting ten years ago, is reportedly handing out signed drawings to convicts who queue outside his cell at Bullingdon Prison, Oxforshire in the hope of securing one of his sketches . Inmates at Bullingdon have dubbed the drawing sessions 'Rolf's Prison Cartoon Club' in reference to his 1990s television programme. File picture . Instead he is offering them free to calm the anger of those who say he was given a 'plum job' of tending to the prison's vegetable patch and grounds. A source told the newspaper: 'Harris has been overwhelmed by requests. He did four or five sketches within two weeks of arriving and now everyone wants one. 'The pictures are just ten-minute cartoon sketches but the inmates love them.' It is understood that inmates even describe his drawing sessions as 'Rolf's Prison Cartoon Club' - a reference to his 1990s television hit Rolf's Cartoon Club. The entertainer settles down to draw between 4.30pm and 6.30pm while prisoners are allowed to walk between cells, The Sun reports. A Prison Service spokeswoman said that it did not comment on individuals. Earlier reports suggested that Harris had angered fellow inmates after being handed a job as prison gardener. Some considered that he may have 'jumped the queue' to land the popular task.

"Nigel Farage is using a private company which could halve the tax bill on his media appearances, it can be revealed. The Ukip leader funnels money from appearances in the media and on the lecture circuit into a firm called Thorn In The Side Ltd. It means that last year he paid only 20 per cent corporation tax on profits of £45,000, instead of 40 per cent income tax. Tonight he faced calls to do the ‘patriotic thing’ and pay full tax like everyone else. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage was urged to 'do the patriotic thing' and pay full income tax on his extra earnings . The revelation risks leaving him open to allegations of hypocrisy, having previously criticised people who try to avoid tax as the ‘common enemy’. The details of his tax affairs emerged ahead of his live TV debate with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg tonight on BBC2 at 7pm. The use of personal service companies is not illegal, but has been criticised across the political spectrum as a way to reduce tax bills. Companies House records show that in 2012-13 Thorn In The Side Limited made a profit of £45,488. If this had been declared as income he would have paid £21,883.03 in 40 per cent income tax and national insurance. But by using Thorn In The Side as a personal service company, he will have only paid £9,097.60 in corporation tax, and a further £1,687.50 on a £7,500 he took as a dividend, taxed at 22.5 per cent. This will have presented a saving of £11,097.93 on an income tax bill. Mr Farage could then draw the money out as income more slowly, limiting his tax liability. He would be taxed on the money when he draws it later. He used to declare outside earnings on his register of members interests for journalism of €500- €1,000 and lecturing fees of €1,001- €5,000 a month. It is not clear what Mr Farage is actually paid for, but he regularly appears on TV and radio and writes in newspapers, although not all publications pay for articles. Thorn In The Side Limited is declared in Mr Farage's latest register of interests in Brussels . But the latest entry shows that he is director of Thorn In The Side Limited, where he now pays his outside earnings. As an MEP Mr Farage also earns £78,000-a-year from Brussels and employs his wife Kirsten on the taxpayer, on a salary of up to £20,000. Details of his expense claims are unclear, but in January the Sunday Mirror said he received  £61,065 in allowances for six months. In a speech last year, he took aim at ‘a common enemy - rich people, successful companies evading tax which of course is a problem’. Today Labour MP John Mann said: ‘He should do the patriotic thing and pay full British tax like everybody else. It is the same old tired politicians. ‘He is as bad as the rest of them. He is part of that freeloading rich minority. The patriotic thing would be to pay your British taxes and stop tax dodging.’ Thorn In The Side Ltd was incorporated in 2011 and Mr Farage is the only director, owning 100 per cent of shares. It is registered at the address of Buckley Watson Accountants in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. Last year Mr Farage was branded a 'hypocrite' after admitting he opened an offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill while campaigning against tax avoidance. He set up a scheme on the Isle of Man for ‘inheritance purposes’ but later he claimed he never used it, adding: ‘It was a mistake. I’m not rich enough.’ In the 2012 London Mayoral race Labour’s Ken Livingstone was criticised for using a personal service company after declaring: ‘No one should be allowed to vote in a British election, let alone sit in Parliament, unless they pay their full share of tax.’ The BBC has also come under fire for allowing star presenters to have their wages paid into such companies, which means they end up paying less tax. The off-the-books arrangements create ‘suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance’, according to Commons spending watchdog Margaret Hodge. MailOnline contacted Ukip before publication but there has so far been no response.","Ukip leader pays earnings from journalism and lecturing to his own firm .

"Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset has been revealed in a leaked image, a Dutch website has claimed.

It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. According to the leaked image from a Dutch site, the S6 has a very thin bezel, and a rounded design similar to the iPhone 6. 'A striking feature of the prototype are the thin left and right edges of the screen, and the displacement of the selfie camera toward the center of the top,' it says.

However, French site nowherele.fr claims that handset is a fake, and in fact shows another Samsung model. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. In the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung has announced plans to curb the number of phones  it makes each year by between a quarter and a third. Instead of saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better . Despite a drop in profits, Samsung has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter. But, it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline. Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG all posted more than 15 per cent growth in their smartphone shipments, according to market research firm IDC. Samsung's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter, and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year. Samsung's rise to the world's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with Google's Android operating system. But other Android handset makers are matching Samsung in terms of performance, features and design. Shares of Samsung Electronics did rise 4 per cent, however, in Seoul. Although the earnings were weak, they were better than some forecasts. Plus Samsung said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to Christmas. The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Last month, for the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits took a hit. The smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September. These figures were in line with what Samsung predicted earlier in October, and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model. The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models. But the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business. In response to the dramatic drop, Samsung also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured Samsung Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. The earnings were below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider. The decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED. 'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. The latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone' In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.","The handset, appears to have a 5.5inch screen and thin design .

"Cristiano Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has cast doubt on the star making an emotional return to Manchester United and says he will retire at Real Madrid 'when he is 40' while claiming there will not be a player as good as the forward 'for 500 years'. Mendes, who negotiated Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria's moves to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, admitted the 29-year-old forward still had a soft spot for the Red Devils.

"Stewart Downing believes West Ham have a stronger squad this season as the challenge of juggling league and cup football beckons. Sam Allardyce's side reached the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup last season and start their tilt at the trophy with a home game against Sheffield United on Tuesday evening. Weigh them up: Downing is confident West Ham can balance the Premier League and cup competitions . The Hammers were in the midst of a mid-season injury crisis as they lost 9-0 on aggregate to the eventual winners Manchester City in January - with Barclays Premier League survival the main concern. With a number of first-team players missing at the time, Allardyce was forced to field an inexperienced side in both legs - but Downing, who scored his first goal of the season in Saturday's 3-1 win at Crystal Palace, reckons the summer recruit drive at Upton Park will help significantly on that front. 'I think all the new signings have settled in well and those who have played have made good starts,' said the England winger. 'We have a bit of a stronger squad this season which I think helps the manager. Last season the team had to literally pick itself at times because of injuries. 'We have a lot more options now and can change it around a bit if needed.' Of the seven new acquisitions, Aaron Cresswell, Cheikhou Kouyate and Mauro Zarate have made an instant impact - with the latter opening the scoring at Selhurst Park with a spectacular volley. Balance: West Ham lost in the semi-final of the Capital One Cup to Manchester City last season . Strikers Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho are still working on their fitness, while Carl Jenkinson is injured and young midfielder Diego Poyet has played just eight minutes. With a deeper squad at his disposal, Allardyce is likely to give Poyet - as well as Valencia and Sakho - a chance to work their way into his thinking against the Blades. Downing will also want to be involved against the Sky Bet League One side as he looks to add to his goal on Saturday, which equalled the solitary strike he managed throughout the whole of last season. 'Obviously I am eager as is the manager for me to get more goals this season,' he added. 'To get off the mark second game in, is nice. I want to shoot more, get in the positions I need to be in. With the goal, I had it in my head what I wanted to do and hit it where I wanted to and it worked.' It will be the first meeting of the two sides since West Ham agreed an out-of-court settlement for a fee reported to be in excess of £20million to be paid as compensation to the Blades. Victory: West Ham beat Crystal Palace 3-1 on Saturday, after an opening day defeat to Tottenham . The argument stemmed following Sheffield United's relegation from the Barclays Premier League in 2007 - with West Ham surviving thanks largely to the goals of Carlos Tevez. It was later discovered that Tevez, as well as fellow Argentina international Javier Mascherano, were partially owned by Media Sports Investment, a company run by Kia Joorabchian. The Premier League fined West Ham £5.5million and, after United unsuccessfully appealed to be reinstated to the league with West Ham relegated instead, a two-year legal wrangle ended with the settlement. With plenty of ill-feeling between the two sets of fans, Allardyce insisted on Saturday he would do his utmost to appease West Ham's supporters by winning the fixture. 'I think the reaction is to get a team out there that wins,' he said. 'I'm not so sure how guilty Sheffield United were on it but that's nothing do with me. It's about making sure the fans are happy when I go on Tuesday because they feel aggrieved at what Sheffield United did and if I can do that for them, then great.'","Stewart Downing insists West Ham have a stronger squad this season .

"Vladimir Putin was today directly and personally threatened by the Islamic State because of his close ties to Syrian leader Bashar Hafez al-Assad. The chilling warning, delivered by a member of the terror group, puts the Kremlim leader on the same side as the West in holding back Muslim extremism. But at the same time, he remains at loggerheads with the U.S. and Europe in the worst crisis since the Cold War. Scroll down for video . Warning: Vladimir Putin was today directly and personally threatened by the Islamic State because of his close ties to Syrian leader Bashar Hafez al-Assad. Above, an ISIS rebel delivers the chilling warning on video . Rebels: In the video, the man was sat in the cockpit of a captured Russian-made fighter aircraft in the Tabak area of the Syrian province of Rakka. He was joined by a number of other fighters (pictured stood on the plane) In a video on Al-Arabiya TV channel, an ISIS rebel sits in the cockpit of a captured Russian-made fighter aircraft in the Tabak area of the Syrian province of Rakka. A second fighter warns: 'This message is addressed to you, oh Vladimir Putin. These are your aircraft which you sent to Bashar, and with the help of Allah we will send them back to you. 'Remember this. And with the permission of Allah we will liberate Chechnya and all the Caucasus. ""The Islamic State exists and it will exist and it will expand with the help of Allah. Your throne is already shaking. It is in danger and it will collapse  when we get to you. We are on the way with Allah's permission.' The warning puts the Kremlim leader on the same side as the West in holding back Muslim extremism . The threatening footage comes with Russian subtitles, but the voice of a Russian speaker can be heard too. In the sequence, in which the Islamic warriors clamber over the Sukhoi fighter, they also threaten the Syrian dictator, branding him a 'pig' and vowing to 'use these aircraft to get to you'. The message of hate to Putin follows his strong support for Assad, without which he is likely to have been toppled. Putin is also loathed by Islamic extremists and terror groups for crushing attempts to set up an Islamic state in Chechnya, and in other mainly Muslim regions of southern Russia such as Dagestan. The Russian leader has long argued that the West has missed the danger of such extremist groups while criticising him for human rights abuses in his clampdown. The video was released amid a warning to Putin that far from NATO being his biggest threat - as Russian propaganda is daily arguing - the real danger to him is from Muslim extremism on his southern flank. This was highlighted today in The Moscow Times newspaper by Judy Dempsey,  senior associate and editor-in-chief of Strategic Europe at Carnegie Europe. 'Outgoing NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has repeatedly spoken about an ""arc of instability"" around Europe,' she wrote. 'He has repeatedly warned Russia that it . would suffer the consequences after Putin's decision in March to invade . and then annex Crimea, Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine and . Putin's call for immediate talks on ""statehood"" of southern and eastern . Ukraine, or Novorossiya. Threatening: The footage comes with Russian subtitles, but the voice of a Russian speaker can be heard too . 'But it is clear that so far Western . sanctions and NATO's threats and rhetoric are no deterrence when it . comes to thwarting Putin's ambitions. 'What could deter him is his own combustible southern flank and Islamic State, which Russia would be very unwise to ignore. 'It is these threats that are far, far more dangerous to Russia than NATO's limited intentions in Poland and the Baltic states. Ties: The Russian leader was targeted by the rebels because of his ties to Bashar Hafez al-Assad (pictured) 'These threats are also more dangerous than the EU, whose openness has hugely profited Russian companies and ordinary Russian citizens. 'If Putin thinks NATO and the EU are his big threats, competitors and enemies, he hasn't seen anything yet.'","Vladimir Putin was threatened because of close ties to Bashar al-Assad .

The Spaniard was again inventive in the blue of Chelsea against Leicester on Saturday, setting up Eden Hazard for a goal that finally sunk a resolute defence at Stamford Bridge. The former Arsenal man is settling in perfectly in west London, accumulating a pass accuracy of 93.5 per cent. 8. Carlton Cole, West Ham (35.9) Sam Allardyce is desperate to bring in another striker to West Ham, but if the performance at Selhurst Park was anything to go by, the Hammers don't need one. Cole, often castigated by fans. lead the line expertly  against Crystal Palace, netting in the 3-1 win. The target man also boasted a pass completion rate of 85.7 per cent.

Mauro Zarate, West Ham (41.5) Completing the West Ham party is Mauro Zarate, who really stood out on his debut. The tricky Argentine netted to cap a fine afternoon, where he played off Carlton Cole and linked the midfield and attack. As if a goal wasn't enough, his pass completion rate was up at 92.9 per cent, an unheard of figure for a West Ham forward. Settling in: Mauro Zarate controlled proceedings on his debut for the Hammers against Palace . 4. Emmanuel Adebayor, Tottenham (41.6) One goal, one assist and a 92.9 per cent pass completion. It doesn't get much better for a striker. Adebayor typified Tottenham's stunning showing against QPR on Sunday, leading a free-flowing line-up that dominated proceedings at White Hart Lane.

Eden Hazard, Chelsea (45.4) There's no doubt Leicester made Chelsea sweat at Stamford Bridge on Saturday... but in the end quality shines through.

The Belgian midfielder was in and out of the team last year but really came of age at White Hart Lane, netting twice in a comprehensive victory.

Stevan Jovetic, Manchester City (49.6) Often criticised in his first season at the Etihad Stadium, the Montenegrin struggled for form and fitness after moving from Fiorentina. With Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo out of the picture in the summer though, Jovetic impressed in pre-season and seems to be bringing that form to the Premier Leauge.

As well as disabling key elements of their network, hackers also took and leaked a trove of embarrassing e-mails, which revealed the a top executive made a racist jibe at Obama, insulted Angelina Jolie, and tinkered with the storyline of a film about North Korea. Scroll down for video . Crippled: The entertainment giant can no longer process payments thanks to the crippling computer attack, according to reports. Pictured is Sony Corporation CEO Kazuo Hirai . A source told the Times of London that the company can't process any payments, which has in turn led third parties to cancel shoots. The scale of the suspension was not immediately clear. MailOnline has contacted Sony Pictures for comment. The revelation on Friday is the latest in a damaging chain of revelations linked to the action, seemingly with the aim of preventing the release of The Interview, a film in which North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is assassinated. In emails that were leaked on Thursday, Sony Corporation Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai wrote to Amy Pascal asking that scenes from the movie featuring Jong-un be removed or edited. Pascal then shared the information with the film's star, writer and director, Seth Rogen, who was none too happy. Not happy: Seth Rogen (above), who wrote, directed and starred in the film The Interview was asked to change key scenes . Supreme leader: The Interview tells the story of two men sent to North Korea to try and kill Jong-un (above) 'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy,' wrote Rogen in an email to Pascal obtained by Bloomberg News. 'That is a very damning story.' Pascal tried to explain herself to Rogen, saying; 'As embarrassing as this has been from my point of view, you have to appreciate the fact that we haven't just dictated to you what it had to be.' She then adds, 'This isn't some flunky. It's the chairman of the entire Sony Corporation who I am dealing (with).' In another email she cites the proximity of North Korea to Japan as another reason changes might be necessary. 'I haven’t the foggiest notion how to deal with Japanese politics as it relates to Korea so all I can do is make sure that Sony won’t be put in a bad situation and even that is subjective,' she tells Rogen. Rogen agrees to make the changes, though Pascal does put in an email to Hirai that there was some 'resistance from the filmmakers.' The changes, which have to do with a major plot point, seem to take some time to deal with, and Rogen completes the task to Hirai's liking it would seem by October, writing in his final email, 'Please tell us this is over now.' And while he may have been annoyed and angered, Rogen is still very much a fan of Pascal, praising her Thursday evening at the premiere of the film. 'We want to thank Amy Pascal for having the balls to make this movie,' said Rogen. Ironically, however, the film is not set to open in Asia. Her again: Sony head Amy Pascal (above) was tasked with telling Rogen he had to make changes . The changes are also described in the emails, though they spoil the film, which is set to open on December 25. This is just the latest email leak from a group calling themselves The Guardians of Peace, who, as previously mentioned, want to stop the release of The Interview. Pascal said in an interview Thursday that every employee's email from the past 10 years was obtained in the hack, meaning these leaks could go on for weeks or even months. It is believed that a group from North Korea is behind the hack. The scenes that were changed are detailed in the emails, and show what an amusing and out there film The Interview will be . WARNING: Spoilers! In one email, Pascal writes to Harei: 'In shot #337 there is no face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face, and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire, as well as darkened to look less like flesh.' She then adds, 'We arrived at this shot (#337) after much cajoling and resistance from the filmmakers.' In another email, Doug Belgrad, president of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion picture group, wrote to Pascal: 'In the interest of getting this approved, I would still like to see them eliminate the tendril of flesh on the left side of his forehead that comes just before the fireball.' Harei also requested that the scene where Jong-un's head explodes not be shown in any versions of the film outside the United States.","Sony Pictures reportedly left unable to process payments, leading to halt .

"The international break may represent a change of scenery for the players but for their managers it's a time when nerves are frayed. They watch helplessly as their stars fly off to the four corners of the globe to represent their countries and can only pray they don't return injured or fatigued. But tiredness seems inevitable when you take a look at the air miles some of the Premier League players will be racking up over the next fortnight. Chelsea's Willian will fly over 14,600 miles to represent Brazil in Far East friendlies with Argentina and Japan . Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho will also be part of the Brazil squad making a long-haul trip to the Far East. Cristian Gamboa, seen tackling him, is in the Costa Rica squad also heading to Asia for friendlies . Jose Mourinho is just one of the Premier League managers concerned their players will come back jet-lagged . The Chelsea trio of Filipe Luis, Oscar and Willian, as well as Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, are named in the Brazil squad for their friendlies against Argentina in Beijing and Japan in Singapore. They face a gruelling 14,600-mile round trip to fulfil the money-spinning fixtures in the Far East, something that won't please Jose Mourinho or Brendan Rodgers with important club games to come. Chelsea's Ramires and Manchester City's Fernandinho have already been withdrawn from Dunga's squad for the friendlies, on Saturday and Tuesday, through injury. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal went public with his frustration at summer signings Angel Di Maria and Marcos Rojo having to fly 12,000-plus miles to turn out for Argentina in two friendlies. As their unconvincing 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday proved, Van Gaal needs time to work with his team ahead of a tough run of fixtures that includes Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in the next six weeks. Angel Di Maria is jetting off with Argentina for matches against Brazil in Beijing and Hong Kong . Marcos Rojo will also be part of the Argentine party making the 12,276-mile round trip to the Far East . So he was understandably irritated that Di Maria and Rojo are travelling so far to play in meaningless games. Discussing United's poor second half performance against Everton, Van Gaal said: 'That is why we have to train, but now all my players are gone. The rest are injured so we cannot train. Now I have to wait. 'Di Maria and Rojo are coming back from Hong Kong. They are playing two friendly games. They are coming back with jetlag so I cannot train at once and then I have to wait. 'Then I have only two or three days before the game with West Bromwich Albion. That is my problem I know and we live in this football world. 'I was also a national coach [with Holland] but it is not so easy as everybody thinks.' Man United manager Louis van Gaal expressed frustration that some players are going so far for friendlies . Radamel Falcao and Colombia will play friendlies with El Salvador and Canada in New Jersey this week . As mentioned earlier, Argentina are in Beijing to play Brazil in the 2014 Superclasico de las Americas, a fixture that can easily be taken and marketing around the globe, and then play Hong Kong three days later. Van Gaal can only count his blessings that United's match with West Brom isn't until the Monday night, giving him extra time to prepare. And he'll take some consolation in the fact Radamel Falcao, who opened his scoring account on Sunday, is 'only' going 6,900 miles over to New Jersey and back for friendlies with El Salvador and Canada. Others, like Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and QPR's Harry Redknapp, have less time to get ready for the return of the league action. Alexis Sanchez (right) is heading off on a 14,577-mile round trip back home to play two friendlies with Chile . Arsene Wenger can only wait and hope that all his players return from the international break without injury . Both will wave off the Chilean members of their squad - Alexis Sanchez, Mauricio Isla and Eduardo Vargas - on a 14,577-mile round trip back home for friendlies against Peru on Friday and Bolivia on Tuesday. Arsenal play Hull City at the Emirates on Saturday afternoon but with Sanchez unlikely to resume training until Thursday at the earliest, he may feel a little sluggish come matchday. Joel Campbell, meanwhile, is one of five Premier League and Championship players included in the Costa Rica squad that will be making a 13,200-mile whistlestop tour of Muscat in Oman and Seoul in South Korea for two friendlies. He is joined by Cristian Gamboa of West Brom, Bryan Oviedo of Everton, Jose Miguel Cubero of Blackpool and Bryan Ruiz of Fulham for the long-haul trip. Everton's Bryan Oviedo has been called up to the Costa Rica squad for matches with Oman and South Korea . Swansea's Ki Sung-yueng will feature for South Korea in two home friendlies with Paraguay and Costa Rica . Other players clocking up a five-figure mileage are the South Korean duo of Ki Sung-yeung of Swansea and Lee Chung-yong of Bolton, who will make the 11,119-mile jaunt home and back for games with Paraguay on Friday and Costa Rica on Tuesday. Most players will be taking part in European Championship qualifiers, meaning short-haul trips, but there is also competitive action taking place in Africa. The qualifiers for the Africa Cup of Nations next year have reached ther half-way point and all the leading nations are in action over the next few days. The Ivory Coast face a home and away double-header with DR Congo and Yaya Toure, Cheick Tiote and Wilfried Bony are all named in the squad for a round trip of over 8,000 miles. For the managers, it's time to cross fingers they won't come back tired or, even worse, injured. Yaya Toure is in competitive action for the Ivory Coast as they take on DR Congo home and away .

"Fathers and grandparents will not be given any legal right to see children after a break-up, under the biggest changes to family law in a generation. In what was immediately denounced as a ‘betrayal’ of the family, a major report today rules against giving men shared or equal time with their children when a relationship ends. It suggests fathers will even be denied the legal right to maintain a ‘meaningful relationship’ with their families, as this ‘would do more harm than good’. Frozen out: Both fathers and grandparents could lose the right to see children under a huge shake-up to family law . The review also kicks into touch . Coalition pledges to make it easier to maintain contact with . grandchildren when parents separate, a problem that usually affects . those on the father’s side. The . long-awaited Family Justice Review was branded a ‘monstrous sham’ that . undermines David Cameron’s pledge to lead the most family-friendly . government in history. The independent report was . commissioned by ministers to examine the case for reform of a family law . system repeatedly accused of putting rights of mothers over those of . fathers and grandparents. But its proposals – likely to form the basis of future government family policy – sparked an immediate Cabinet revolt. Pledge: David Cameron, pictured yesterday, promised to lead the most family-friendly Government in history. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, right, will do more for fathers and grandparents, his allies said . Break-up: Fathers will lose the right to have a meaningful relationship with their children when they split from their partner, the long-awaited Family Justice Review appeared to suggest . Allies of Work and Pensions Secretary . Iain Duncan Smith said he would fight to ensure the Government’s . response – due to be published in January – will do more for fathers and . grandparents. A source close to the Cabinet . minister said that the findings were ‘absurd’, warning that they . undermined attempts to tackle the generation of fatherless youths blamed . for the summer’s riots. But Justice Secretary Ken Clarke is . expected to back the review, chaired by former civil servant and Marks . & Spencer executive David Norgrove. His report was commissioned by Labour . and dismissed by the Tories in Opposition as inadequate but will now . form the basis of Coalition legislation. The review comes against a backdrop . of soaring divorce rates and increasing numbers of children  being born . out of wedlock, often to co-habitees who are more likely to break up . than married couples. Last year there were almost three . million children aged under 16 living in a lone-parent household – or . 24 per cent of the total. Mr Norgrove’s findings fly in the . face of studies showing that it is best for a child to have extensive . access to both its father and mother. The . report says: ‘No legislation should be introduced that creates or risks . creating the perception that there is a parental right to substantially . shared or equal time for both parents.’ Mr . Norgrove has even watered down his own interim report, published in . March, which said there should be a legal presumption that children . should have a ‘meaningful relationship’ with both parents. The head of the Family Justice Review is a millionaire economist with three children of his own. David Norgrove, 63, pictured, earned a reputation as a tough taskmaster during 16 years in a string of senior roles at Marks & Spencer. He quit in 2004 following a disastrous set of Christmas results for the retailer, taking with him a £754,000 pay-off and a £100,000-a-year pension. As trustee of the firm’s pension fund he then famously saw off a hostile £9.1billion takeover bid from Sir Philip Green. Mr Norgrove, who lives in Islington, North London, took an unlikely career break, flying to New Zealand for a six-week stint as a farmhand. But the former Treasury economist – who served as Margaret Thatcher’s private secretary in Downing Street – soon returned to work, becoming the first chairman of the Pensions Regulator in 2005. He remains chairman of the Low Pay Commission. Mr Norgrove believes that enshrining such rights in law could slow down already lengthy and expensive custody cases. Instead, the courts will simply have to consider the benefits of a meaningful relationship when they decide where children should live and how often they should see each parent. The final report flatly rejected claims by fathers’ rights groups that the current system is biased – despite figures showing that 93 per cent of custody battles are won by the mother. Nadine O’Connor, of the Fathers 4 Justice campaign group, said: ‘The review is a monstrous sham and a bureaucratic exercise in improving the efficiency of injustice. It will feed the epidemic of mass fatherlessness and lead to further social unrest. ‘This report condemns children to a life without fathers with catastrophic social consequences.’ The report also contradicts pledges by senior officials earlier this year that grandparents would be given far greater rights. Instead, they will still have to apply to court twice to see their grandchildren: once for the right to begin a case and then to seek access to their loved ones. The Norgrove panel merely issued a tepid recommendation that their role should be ‘emphasised’. Instead of legal protections for fathers and grandparents, the Norgrove report laid out plans to encourage parents to settle disputes before they get to court. All parents will be given advice on drawing up ‘parenting agreements’ to divide the care of their children. James Deuchars, of Grandparents Apart UK, said: ‘The Tories said before the election that grandparents were going to have more rights. This is a betrayal of that promise. It was all a con and a gimmick. ‘This report is trying to do away with the traditional family. The result will be more bitter and disillusioned young boys who join gangs.’ A source close to Mr Cameron said the Government has ‘certainly not’ pledged to adopt all the report’s recommendations. But a source close to Mr Clarke described it as ‘an authoritative account of the problems and a thoughtful look at the solutions’. The report also said no childcare case should last more than six months and recommended the creation of a Family Justice Service to focus the work of all agencies for the 500,000 children and adults caught up in the family courts each year.","Fathers will be denied the right to have a 'meaningful relationship' with their families, report suggests .

"You may be unlikely to get a reply, but a US firm has revealed the first postal service to send items to the moon. Astrobiotic hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items - with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000. The firm, which has dubbed the service MoonMail, says it can even offer to give over entire missions for larger items that need more shipping space. Scroll down for video . The project aims to put a lander of the lunar surface containing hundreds of capsules people have bought to send everything from rings to photos to the lunar surface. The capsules purchased will be placed on this Griffin Lander, which is expected to blast off on top of a spaceX rocket in the next two years. Each  MoonMail Kit that will consist of prepaid postage to mail items to Astrobotic, along with a map of the Moon Landing Site, a photo of the Moon Pod on the Moon, and a certificate of authenticity recognizing them as a Space Pioneer on the first commercial landing to the Moon. The collected mementos will be placed inside the Moon Pod that will be attached to Astrobotic's lunar lander, which will remain on the Moon for future generations. 'With MoonMail, people from around the world can send a memento on Astrobotic's lunar lander,' Astrobotic CEO John Thornton said. 'They'll make history by participating in the first commercial Moon landing.' 'With the starting price at $460, this exciting new offering from Astrobotic is an opportunity to commemorate major life events - graduations, weddings, birthdays, a loved one's memory - with a lasting symbol on the Moon,' it says. Astrobotic is a Nasa contractor, and is also an official partner with NASA on the Lunar Catalyst program. With its partner, Carnegie Mellon University, Astrobotic is pursuing the Google Lunar XPRIZE and is scheduled to launch the first mission within the next two years. It will launch on a SpaceX rocket. After achieving low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 second stage re-ignites for trans-lunar injection (TLI) to propel Astrobotic’s spacecraft into a 4.5-day cruise to the moon. It consists of two spacecraft, a lander and the Polaris rover; lander and rover exist as a single spacecraft until touchdown on the lunar surface. The firm is now accepting orders for its capsules online. Each  MoonMail Kit that will consist of prepaid postage to mail items to Astrobotic, along with a map of the Moon Landing Site, a photo of the Moon Pod on the Moon, and a certificate of authenticity recognizing them as a Space Pioneer on the first commercial landing to the Moon. Three basic sizes are offered, but can be customised, with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000. Each buyer will be send a picture of their item onboard the craft before it flies . The capsules will be put into a sealed container and placed inside the lander. The collected mementos will be placed inside the Moon Pod that will be attached to Astrobotic's lunar lander, which will remain on the Moon.. Astrobotic’s first mission will land near a pit in the Moon’s Lacus Mortis region and demonstrate unprecedented landing precision - if it goes according to plan. Astrobotic’s landing technology registers high-quality, real-time camera images taken during the lander’s descent with terrain maps derived from orbital imagery to achieve safe landing at a precise destination. This capability enables Astrobotic’s Griffin lander to fly directly over the pit, capturing close-up views of the floor and walls that cannot be seen from orbit or the ground, and then to land within 100m of the pit. It will search for ice that could help future explorers set up a moon base - and is powered by solat panels that give it the appearance of having a mohawk. The firm says everything from photos to rings can be placed in the capsules. Launch is by SpaceX Falcon 9. After achieving low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 second stage re-ignites for trans-lunar injection (TLI) to propel Astrobotic’s spacecraft into a 4.5-day cruise to the moon. It consists of two spacecraft, a lander and the Polaris rover; lander and rover exist as a single spacecraft until touchdown on the lunar surface. Polaris is a robotic rover with a lunar drill, oven, and instruments for analyzing volatiles that will be delivered to the Moon's surface on Astrobotic’s lunar lander. The lander guides the spacecraft into lunar orbit and controls descent to the surface. The lander delivers 262 kg of payload to any destination on the Moon to support robotic lunar missions like skylight exploration, sample return, regional prospecting, and polar volatile characterization. Polaris will have a drill capable of getting a metre under the lunar surface to look for sign of ice . Polaris prospects for water at the lunar poles. Polaris has vertical solar panels to generate 250W of power and two radiator panels to reject excess heat. Stereo cameras and laser are used to guide Polaris and generate 3-D video and models of the lunar surface. The robot communicates directly with Earth using a pointed S-band antenna to receive commands and send video and data. Polaris carries up to 80kg of payload, such as a drill to take core samples and science instruments to identify water content. Polaris is capable of driving and avoiding obstacles autonomously, including traverses into dark regions in the lunar pole’s long shadows. Polaris’ suspension maintains four-wheel ground contact over sloped and rocky lunar terrain without the use of springs. The robot will explore for ten days until the 14-day cryogenic lunar night begins, then hibernate, recover at sunrise, and continue to explore. The lander and rover are both built to tolerate this cryogenic cold. The life sized working prototype of the Polaris rover that could mine the moon in 2015 . The Polaris rover is 5 ½ feet tall, 7 feet wide and . almost 8 feet long. It can move at about a foot a second on . 2-foot-diameter composite wheels. Its suspension will enable the rover to rise up over rough . terrain, but also lower itself to the ground to perform drilling. The . rover will weigh 150 kilograms, or about 330 pounds, and can accommodate . a drill and science payload of up to 70 kilograms. Polaris is a first of its kind solar-powered robot that will search for potentially rich deposits of water ice on the moon. Observations . by NASA and Indian spacecraft suggest that a substantial amount of . water ice could exist at the lunar poles. That ice could be a source of . water, fuel and oxygen for future expeditions, researchers say. Polaris . can bore one meter into the lunar surface and . can operate in lunar regions characterized by dark, long shadows and a . sun that hugs the horizon. It has been developed for an expedition to . the moon's northern pole that would launch from Cape Canaveral on top of a . SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Polaris . is a flight prototype but has the same configuration as the rover that . will eventually land on the moon. It includes a number of flight-worthy . components, including wheels and chassis beams constructed of light, but . tough composite materials. This . will enable Astrobotic team members to spend the coming months testing . and improving the robot's computer vision, navigation and planning . software, and software that can plot the rover's position on the moon . within 10 feet. The Polaris rover will hunt for ice on the moon that can be mined to help set up moon bases for future explorers . Astrobotic — led by CMU's William 'Red' Whittaker — develops robotics technology for planetary missions. 'It is the . first rover developed specifically for drilling lunar ice' said . Whittaker. Other robots built by the Field Robotics Center have . developed technologies necessary for lunar drilling, but none of them . were ever meant to leave Earth. 'What . Polaris does is bring those many ideas together into a rover . configuration that is capable of going to the moon to find ice,' Whittaker added. To find . the ice, a rover must operate as close to the dark poles as possible, . but not so far that it can't use solar arrays for power, Whittaker said. Polaris has three large solar arrays, arranged vertically to capture . light from low on the horizon. The solar arrays will be capable of an average of 250 watts of electrical power. Polaris . also makes use of software, pioneered in CMU's NASA-funded Hyperion . robot, that keeps track of the rover's position relative to the sun's . rays to maximize solar energy and husbands battery power for use in the . long shadows and dark regions found at the poles. Whittaker said the lunar day lasts about 14 Earth days, though only . about 10 days are suitable for water prospecting at the poles. The Astrobotic team expects Polaris . could drill 10 to 100 holes during that time as it locates and . characterizes water ice deposits. Astrobotic, in partnership with CMU, is also vying for the Google Lunar X Prize of more than $20 million. Polaris is one of two Moon rovers under development by Astrobotic in competition for the Google contest, which offers a total of $30m in awards to privately funded projects exploring the Moon. First prize – $20m – will be awarded to the company that can 'safely land a robot on the surface of the Moon, have that robot travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send video, images and data back to the Earth.' If Polaris successfully survives the long, frigid lunar nights, as anticipated, the prospecting mission could be extended indefinitely. Astrobotic has won nine lunar contracts from NASA worth $3.6 million, including one to evaluate how Polaris can accommodate NASA's ice-prospecting instruments during a three-mile traverse near the moon's north pole.","Prices range from $460 to $26,000 for capsules to be send to lunar surface .

"Sometimes being a cat can be a tiring life: all those catnaps between bouts of idle stretching in front of the fire. But Dodger the ginger tom has found a way to get round the tiresome business of walking anywhere, by hopping on  the bus. The 15-year-old sits on bemused passengers’ laps as the bus makes round trips of up to ten miles from Bridport to Charmouth in Dorset. Where's your ticket? Dodger the cat has been riding the bus for free by hopping on and off at his local station in Dorset . He is such a regular passenger that . some of the drivers take tins of cat food to feed him. They even know . which stop to let him off at so he can return to his home and owner Fee . Jeanes. Mrs Jeanes, 44, believes Dodger, named after the Artful Dodger in Oliver Twist, first took a liking to the buses’ warmth. She said: ‘We moved here 19 months ago . and our house backs on to the bus station. He is an old boy and is very . friendly. Waiting for his bus: Dodger waits at the station before slowly creeping in the bus to make his journey . Pugh's take on the travelling cat . 'Sometimes he just sits in the middle of the road and waits . for the bus to turn up before he gets on.' 'But then he started climbing on board the buses because they are almost like greenhouses when it is sunny. 'Then last week I found out he had travelled to Charmouth and back, which is a 10 mile round trip. 'I hadn’t seen him all morning until my daughter Emily told me one of her friends had just seen him on the bus at Charmouth. 'I . couldn’t believe it and panicked. I got into my car to go off and look . for him and then at that moment the bus pulled up near our house and low . and behold he got off. 'He . had fallen asleep on board and nobody knew about it. When the driver . realised he knew who Dodger was and where he lived and kept him on . board. 'That afternoon I saw Dodger climb on board another bus and I rushed to tell the driver. 'I . was shocked when she told me Dodger was always on there and liked to . sit on the seats because they are warm from where people have been . sitting. Popular passenger: Dodger likes to sleep on paying passengers laps and even gets fed cat food by the bus driver sometimes . Proud owner: Fee Jeanes cuddles her cat once he's home from his bus trip . 'The drivers buy cat food for him and he sits on people’s laps. 'Sometimes he just sits in the middle of the road and waits for the bus to turn up before he gets on.' Dodger is familiar to regular bus passengers and drivers, but Mrs Jeanes still receives several calls a week asking if she has lost a ginger cat. A spokesman for bus firm First said they didn’t mind Dodger on their buses but didn’t actively encourage him. He . said: 'The drivers have been asked not to feed it because we recognise . that cat has an owner and we do not want to discourage it from returning . home for food and shelter. 'But in principle we do not have a problem . with it being around the bus station. 'Given this cat is elderly we suspect it would be eligible for free travel, perhaps a bus puss, if such a thing existed.' Another bus-hopping cat, called . Casper, died last year after being hit by a car while crossing the road . to board the No.3 service in Plymouth.","Dodger is fed cat food by some of the drivers .

"In 1928 motoring pioneer Henry Ford said: 'Mark my word. A combination airplane and motor car is coming. You may smile. But it will come.' Now an incredible flying car that will allow drivers skip traffic jams and take to the skies has been unveiled.

"While Louis van Gaal was taking charge of Manchester United for the first time at Old Trafford, former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was enjoying something his old club will be missing this season - European football. The Old Trafford legend was in Cardiff to watch Real Madrid take on Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. Ferguson saw Cristiano Ronaldo, whose development he oversaw before selling the World Player of the Year to Madrid for a world record transfer fee, score twice for the Champions League holders, and was on hand to congratulate the Real Madrid forward.

"America's financial problems could not be solved by raising taxes on the rich, Bill Clinton said on Wednesday. During an economic speech in Washington, D.C. at Georgetown University caught on tape by Breitbart News former President Bill Clinton hypothetically said taking all of rich peoples' money wouldn't be enough to balance the United States budget. Clinton, who is the richest living president, said he doesn't mind paying higher taxes than other Americans, 'but you could tax me at a hundred percent, and we couldn't bring growth back into the economy enough to balance the budget.' Former President Bill Clinton, who is the richest living president, said on Wednesday he doesn't mind paying higher taxes than other Americans, 'But you could tax me at a hundred percent, and we couldn't bring growth back into the economy enough to balance the budget' USA Today estimated in 2013 that Bill Clinton had a net worth of $55 million and counting. The former president makes millions of dollars a year in speaking fees. More recent estimates put his net worth at $80 million and he and wife Hillary Clinton's combined net worth anywhere from $100 to $200 million. Raising taxes on the rich has become a rallying cry for progressives in the Obama era. President Barack Obama has made his quest to make Americans making more than $250,000 a year pay their 'fair share' in taxes a cornerstone of his presidency. Obama's 'fair share' strategy is based . on the idea that middle-class Americans shouldn't . be paying the same tax rate as 'rich' Americans because it creates an . unfair disparity in wealth. In his 2014 budget released earlier this month, President Obama calls for a minimum 30 percent tax rate on millionaires like the Clintons and Warren Buffet as part of a revived effort to institute the Buffet Rule. The White House claims that many Americans who make $1 million or more are paying less than 15 percent in taxes. Obama wants to double their tax rate. 'Anyone who does well for themselves should do their fair share in . return, so that more people have the opportunity to get ahead—not just a . few,' the White House's page on the Buffet Rule explains. During his two-hour economic speech on Wednesday at Georgetown, his alma mater, Clinton said he supported President Barack Obama's plan to let the Bush tax cuts on the rich to expire because people in his income bracket have 'enough disposable income that it didn't change our consumption patterns much.' But you cut spending too much or raise taxes too much, it wouldn't work, Clinton said. 'You can only balance a budget if you have adequate revenues, adequate spending restraints and adequate growth. The country needs growth,' Clinton said. 'Then everybody will do well.' 'Hillary and I, and some of our friends in this audience who live in New York, probably pay the highest aggregate tax rates in America, and I thank God every April 15 that I'm able to do it. I never ...  The family I grew up in. It's fine. I'm not ... I'm thankful,' Clinton said, choking up a little, as he recalled  his childhood. 'But you could tax me at a hundred percent, and we couldn't bring growth back into the economy enough to balance the budget,' Clinton continued. 'It's got to be a growth strategy.' No federal politician has advocated that the U.S. should begin confiscating wealthy Americans' income in it's entirety. Progressives say they want they want the rich to pay more of their income in taxes, but they have been vague on how tax money they would consider enough. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan once threw out a theoretical 100 percent tax rate during an interview and was smacked down by left-leaning fact-checking site Politifact. 'If you took all the income from every millionaire in America today, it would run the government for about four months,' Ryan said during an appearance on Meet the Press in 2011. Politifact slammed Ryan's example as 'a wildly hypothetical scenario.' 'A 100 percent tax obviously . would have negative effects and is a political non-starter,' Politifact said. Based on the 2008 data Ryan said he was using, Politifact said such a policy would not even come close to fulfilling the United State's debt obligations. It would eliminate the budget deficit, however, it said. Bill Clinton and wife Hillary Clinton, pictured here at her husband's speech on Wednesday, have a combined net worth of $100 to $200 million, millions of which they accumulated through speaking fees .","Former President Bill Clinton shared his economic philosophy at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday .

"Unnecessary: Valerie George shows a strand of cotton similar to the one which she dropped on the floor, landing her with a £75 fine . When a strand of cotton fell from one of her gloves as she was out shopping, Valerie George didn’t even notice. So the 71-year-old grandmother was astonished when a council warden pointed out the thread on the pavement – and handed her a £75 spot fine for dropping litter. ‘I couldn’t believe my eyes,’ she said yesterday. ‘I’m just an ordinary grandmother out shopping, not a litter lout throwing rubbish around.’ Mrs George said that when the environmental enforcement officer first stopped her, she had protested her innocence. But then he took her to the scene of the crime, showed her the curled-up strand of cotton, and issued the fine. Yesterday, council officials continued to insist that an offence had been committed, but said they would no longer be demanding that Mrs George paid the penalty, which would have had to come out of her £105 weekly pension. The pensioner said: ‘I wouldn’t have paid it anyway – I would rather have gone to court. It is ridiculous.’ Mrs George, the wife of a retired factory worker, was shopping in her home town of Brynmawr, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, when she was stopped. ‘I had caught my watch on my glove and a piece of cotton had come off and fallen to the ground,’ she said. Fine: Mrs George was handed the penalty by an over-zealous official . ‘I didn’t notice. If I had I would have picked it up. I told the man it was a complete accident but he said it was still litter and to take the matter up in court. ‘It was a strand of cotton, not a cigarette butt. I can’t believe they would fine a pensioner for dropping something like that. ‘I asked the enforcement officer, who was burly and rude, “Are you really going to take £75 off an old age pensioner?” ‘I am a pensioner, I’ve worked all my life and I’ve never claimed anything. I live on my £105 pension – £75 is a big chunk of that for dropping a tiny piece of cotton.’ The incident happened on a busy street in Brynmawr, South Wales (file photo) Her husband Les, 72, said: ‘My wife was very shaken by the whole thing.’ Blaenau Gwent Council yesterday confirmed that a fixed penalty fine had been issued for the piece of cotton but said it had withdrawn it after an investigation. A spokesman said: ‘While we are satisfied an offence was committed, it is not in line with our priority of tackling litter more associated with affecting street cleanliness.’ In 2009, Kerrie-Anne Hickin, 30, was given a £75 fine after a tissue she was using to wipe her nose blew away in strong winds as she ran to catch a bus in Oldbury, West Midlands. Last year, Nicola Bayston was threatened with a fine of up to £75,000 after putting up 1,000 posters around her home in South Hiendley, South Yorkshire, when her Patterdale terriers, Jess, five, and Bramble, three, disappeared.","Valerie George, 71, handed on-the-spot fine ."
"The rivalry is legendary. A fixture which began during World War One has evolved into one of football’s most dramatic duels, helped along by the presence of the greatest players on the planet and some very short fuses. Pele or Maradona? Messi or Neymar? Kaka, Rivaldo, Batistuta, Riquelme... when it comes to South American superpowers Brazil and Argentina, the flow of talent seems endless. Add passion and the Latin American ‘temperament’ and this is a match with a history of tantrums, too. Pele celebrates after Brazil win the 1970 World Cup in one of football's most iconic images . PLAYED 95 ARG 40 DRAW 24 BRA 31 . Lucky Beijing, then, for being able to host the Superclasico de los Americas at the Bird’s Nest Stadium on Saturday. A normal two-legged clash will be decided by a one-off match this year. Both countries have replaced their managers – Gerardo Martino and Dunga are the new coaches – since the World Cup, which ended so miserably for hosts Brazil. Kaka is back for Brazil, Lionel Messi is fit and raring to go for Argentina and the ingredients are there for yet another memorable meeting. Sportsmail takes a look at 10 previous clashes which hit the headlines, not always for the football. Diego Maradona holds aloft the World Cup in 1986 in a remarkably similar image to that taken in 1986 . June 2012: Argentina 4 Brazil 3 (Friendly, New Jersey) These two countries tend not to do ‘friendlies’ for obvious reasons but Brazil wanted top-class opposition as they prepared for the Olympic Games in London and they certainly got it. Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick, including a winner with a few minutes to go. Ezequiel Lavezzi and Marcelo were both sent off for an ‘altercation’ in injury time. For the record, Brazil’s scorers were Romulo, Oscar and Hulk while Federico Fernandez was the other Argentine who found the net.

Find out who we've picked in our best ever Argentinian and Brazilian sides . June 1990: Argentina 1 Brazil 0 (World Cup, Turin) Diego Maradona’s sublime pass and Claudio Caniggia’s deadly finish earned Argentina the win but this was all about the post-match shenanigans, since confirmed by the big mouth of Senor Maradona. Branco of Brazil was given a bottle of water by the Argentine backroom staff as they treated an injured player and claimed afterwards that it was doped with tranquilisers. Argentina furiously denied the accusation but the ‘Holy Water Affair’, as it was dubbed did happen – Maradona spilled the beans on a TV show later. Just to really ram it home, Argentina’s favourite football chant, to the tune of Bad Moon Rising by Cleerance Clearwater Revival, relives that very match. Lyrics as follows: Brazil tell me how it feels / to have your father at home / I swear to you that even though years go by / we will never forget / that Diego [Maradona] dribbled you / then Cani [Caniggia] scored against you / you're crying since Italy / and you'll see Messi / he will bring us the Cup / Maradona is greater than Pelé . September 2006: Brazil 3 Argentina 0 (Friendly, Emirates Stadium, London) KaaaaaaKaaaaaa. Yes, Brazilian commentators had a field day with Kaka’s name after the most amazing goals from the substitute. Kaka took possession just outside his own ‘D’, set off on a jet-fuelled run, leaving a certain Lionel Messi in his wake, before drifting out to his right and scoring from an acute angle. Anyone in north London that night had a treat. Kaka slots home after an incredible run as Argentina are beaten at the Emirates back in 2006 . Kaka - back in the Brazil squad for Saturday's game in Beijing - was in his prime in 2006 . July 1991: Argentina 3 Brazil 2 (Copa America, Santiago) The tally of goals equalled the number of red cards in yet another tasty meeting between the two old foes. Franco scored for Argentina in the first minute, cancelled out by Branco, who presumably was not accepting dodgy drinks from anyone. Franco and Gabriel Batistuta put Argentina into a 3-1 lead. Joao Paulo pegged one back. Now for the sendings-off: Claudio Caniggia and Mazinho went for a fight in the first half, Enrique and Marcio Santos ditto in the second. Careca followed, having been on the pitch just a few minutes. August 2008: Argentina 3 Brazil 0 (Olympics, Beijing) This semi-final was supposed to be all about Lionel Messi v Ronaldinho, who both played for Barcelona, but Sergio Aguero took centre stage instead. Former Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano was also to play a pivotal part and, again, there were red cards. Brazil finished with nine men after having Lucas Leiva, also of Liverpool, and Thiago Neves sent off in the last 10 minutes, both for tackles on Mascherano. Watched by Maradona, Aguero scored twice in five minutes, with suggestions that the first hit his hand. Aguero also won the penalty as he drew a challenge from Breno and Juan Riquelme scored from the spot. Sergio Aguero celebrates one of his two goals against Brazil at the Beijing Olympics . Aguero and Messi tormented the Brazilian defence that day before going on to win gold . February 1937: Argentina 2 Brazil 0 AET (South American Championships, Buenos Aires) As the countries were tied after the group stage of what was to become the Copa America, Buenos Aires hosted a play-off decider. There had already been ill-feeling with Argentine fans accused of racist chanting – they called Brazil’s player macaquitos (monkeys) too. When the Brazil team heard further chants, they walked off the pitch and left the stadium before the match was finished. The match is known as ‘The game of shame’. June 2005: Brazil 4 Argentina 1 (Confederations Cup, Frankfurt) Football was the winner here, in the traditional pre-World Cup warm-up tournament. Brazil were two up within the first quarter of an hour through Adriano and Kaka. Ronaldinho volleyed goal No 3 before Adriano wrapped up the scoring for Brazil. All Argentina had to cheer was a late header from Pablo Aimar. Just three weeks earlier Argentina had beaten their old foes in a World Cup qualifier. Ronaldinho scores Brazil's third goal on their way to stuffing Argentina 4-1 in Germany in 2005 . June 1978: Argentina 0 Brazil 0 (World Cup, Rosario) Once again, the story was not so much the match, which was an attritional scoreless draw, but what went on afterwards. Both countries were tied on three points at the top of their group so making their final group fixture crucial. Brazil beat Poland 3-1 during the day, which left hosts Argentina knowing they needed to win by four goals. They duly crushed Peru 6-0 amid allegations of match-rigging. It was as a result of that that FIFA decided to make the final group games kick off at the same time. July 1982: Brazil 3 Argentina 1 (World Cup, Barcelona) A proper Group of Death pitted Brazil, Argentina and Italy together and it was Argentina who missed out although Maradona, who had just signed for Barcelona from Boca Juniors, managed to grab plenty of headlines with a red card for kicking Joao Batista. A Brazilian side with names like Zico, Junior, Socrates and Falcao proved too good for Argentina. Zico and Junior both scored with the third coming from Serginho. Falcao (the original) has a shot on goal against Argentina at the 1982 World Cup . February 1946: Argentina 2 Brazil 0 (South American Championships, Buenos Aries) Players fought with police, fans invaded the pitch and both teams had to go to the dressing rooms while order was restored in a match which has gone down in folklore in South America. The spark was ignited when both Jair Rosa Pinto and Jose Salomon went for the same ball – and Argentine captain Salomon’s leg was broken in two places. Tempers flared and chaos ensued. Salomon never played professional football again.","Argentina face Brazil on Saturday to mark 100 years since their first match .

"Jack Wilshere will see a specialist next week to determine the extent of the damage to his left ankle. The Arsenal midfielder limped off with damaged  ligaments sustained in a tackle with Paddy McNair during Saturday's defeat by Manchester United.

'I cannot give you any time schedule there because he will be out for a while and he has to see a specialist next week to see how long he will be out.

"An assistant principal falsely accused of having sex with a teenage student was forced to sell her home and has revealed everyone 'turned their back' on her in the wake of the allegations. Catherine Armstrong Bell, 34, was arrested in December 2013 and charged with four counts of abuse during her tenure at Pelham High School in Shelby County, Alabama. But on Monday, exactly a year later, a judge dismissed the case and ruled that Bell can never face charges over the same incident in the future. In a teary interview with ABC 33/40, she described how she had dedicated her whole life to teaching, but woke up one day to find it had all been taken away. Emotional: Catherine Armstrong Bell, 34, was arrested in December 2013 and charged with four counts of abuse during her tenure at Pelham High School in Shelby County, Alabama. She revealed how everyone turned her back on her despite the fact she was falsely accused . Cleared: The 34-year-old was absolved of four counts of sexual abuse after the alleged victim recounted . She said: 'I dedicated and invested a large part of my life into doing that. And I loved doing what I did. 'To wake up and have that all taken away and gone, and have people say the things that they said about me, that were not true. And to have people turn their back on you really hurt.' According to Bell's defense attorney Rick Lyerly, the case started as a school rumor that 'accelerated' into accusations. He revealed that Bell was forced to move in with her mother when the allegations surfaced, lost her job and couldn't get work. He said electronic and DNA evidence 'came back negative' and the student has since stated that 'these events never occurred'. Lyerly told AL.com: 'Our position was always that she was wrongfully accused, that these events never occurred. 'I think once all the evidence was gathered and presented to the District Attorney's Office, they did the right thing and agreed to the dismissal.' He added that Bell is the victim in the case, having 'lost her job, sold her home, moved in with her mom,' and 'couldn't get work'. The indictment, filed last May, alleged that Bell had engaged in sexual conduct with a male student between December 2012 and November 2013. Scandal: Bell's attorney said the allegations started as a rumor at the Alabama school but 'accelerated' Struggle: The teacher, who has struggled to find work since, said she dedicated her whole life to her job and was devastated to find that it had all disappeared when she woke up one day . She was charged with three counts of engaging in sexual intercourse with a student younger than 19 and one count of touching a student. In an order passed this week, Bell was granted 'full, complete, and absolute release from all civil and criminal liability stemming directly or indirectly' from the case. 'The District Attorney's got more important things to do than fool with cases that have no merit,' Lyerly said. 'I think this was the right result and nobody wants to see teachers take advantage of students. But when the teacher did nothing wrong and still gets charged, it makes a sad story. 'She is actually the real victim in this case.'","Catherine Armstrong Bell, 34, was fired after she was arrested in Dec 2013 .

"Noddy Holder does not look like a drink and drug-addled rocker. His skin is pink and soft, his hair is fluffy and clean, and his mutton chops are still fulsome. Even his long-suffering liver is still going strong. ‘I tend to get pretty plastered but I’ve got an amazing constitution,’ he says. ‘All the different bands have tried to outdrink me and spike my drinks. Ozzy Osbourne [the Black Sabbath singer] had all sorts of tricks. I was the only one who could keep up with him, though he was much more into drugs than me. Mr Nice Guy: Slade's Noddy Holder in 1973, dressed in a striking suit, and sporting a similar pattern today. The 68-year-old  is happily married and has just written a book, The World According To Noddy . ‘But I’ve never passed out. Never even had a proper memory blackout. Or been sick. ‘Today, I drink fewer drinks, but stronger: Gin Martinis. I could still be up all night, no problem, but now it takes me a week to get over it. In fact, I’m off out tonight!’ Noddy (real name Neville, after Neville Chamberlain) is 68. Back in the day, Slade, the glam rockers he fronted, were superstars. They sold 50 million records, made 20 albums and had six Number Ones, including 1973 Christmas hit Merry Xmas Everybody. Officially the most heard song in the world, it still generates well over £500,000 in royalties every festive season — ‘It’s a brilliant pension plan,’ says Noddy. They had groupies (despite being ‘a bit uglier and heavier than most of the other bands’) and private jets. They partied every night, slept with hundreds of different girls (‘though the best bit was always when they’d ask us all round to their parents’ house for Sunday lunch’) and grasped opportunities that most young lads from Walsall could only have imagined. Superstars: Slade sold 50 million records, made 20 albums and had six Number Ones, including 1973 Christmas hit Merry Xmas Everybody . ‘Most people we knew had never been abroad. When you’re in a rock band, you want to pick up girls, drive flash cars and see the world — and we made the most of it. We didn’t know it was going to last 25 years!’ But Slade were never quite what you’d describe as ‘cool’. Nor were they edgy. There were no massive drug-binges (‘we were more of a booze band’), no orgies, threesomes (‘I don’t think we were really into all that’) or scandalous arrests. There wasn’t even any gratuitous smashing-up of hotel rooms. While rival bands were busy hurling tellies through windows, Noddy was more likely to be doing a spot of DIY in his room. Wholesome: Over the years, many of Noddy’s peers fell foul of drugs, alcohol, suicide, bankruptcy. He avoided it all. Above, pictured in 1974 . ‘I always carried a screwdriver, and later a full tool kit. So, if I had an hour before the gig, I’d fix things. It was quicker than calling down to reception, and that way you can have it all nice for the next person.’ Even Slade’s legendary parties (‘we had one pretty much every single night we were on tour’) would come to a sudden halt when the boys got a bit tired. ‘We’d put on [BBC comedy] Hancock’s Half Hour. The Yanks couldn’t understand it, but we’d fall about laughing and they’d get bored and go home … and we’d go to bed.’ Over the years, many of Noddy’s peers fell foul of drugs, alcohol, suicide, bankruptcy, increasingly desperate comebacks and terrible hair-dye. He, meanwhile, remains a picture of wholesome contentment. He enjoys acting, radio work, does lucrative voice-overs for TV adverts, lives in a ‘very nice house’ near Manchester, is happily married and has just written a book, The World According To Noddy, which is part memoir, part musings about life. He is also, despite leaving the band more than 23 years ago (to tend to his dying father and pick up the pieces of his crumbling first marriage), instantly recognisable as Slade’s frontman. Which has its drawbacks. ‘At least once a day throughout the year, someone shouts “It’s Christmas!” at me. In December, it happens 10 or 20 times a day, and I have to get my Christmas shopping out of the way before December or I get mobbed. ‘I’m not complaining — writing Merry Xmas was the best day’s work we’ve ever done and I’m proud of it — but they all think it’s the first time anyone’s ever shouted it. ‘And I’ve been getting this for 40-odd years!’ (An estimated 42 per cent of the planet, more than three billion people, are thought to have heard Merry Xmas Everybody.) Today, people also try to grab covert snaps of Noddy to post online. Bizarrely, some men attempt to take surreptitious pictures of Noddy’s manhood as he relieves himself at public urinals. ‘They lean over and go “click”. It happens all the time. It’s ludicrous. Why on earth would someone want a photo of me p***ing?’ Why indeed? Perhaps it’s just the (very odd) price of fame. Which all started in Walsall in 1966 when Noddy joined drummer Don Powell and guitarists Dave Hill and Jim Lea to form The ‘NBetweens. They later became Slade and had a huge hit with Coz I Luv You. They dressed in over-the-top mirrored outfits, strutted like peacocks (‘The Americans thought four aliens had landed’), made a fortune and paid outlandish amounts of tax. ‘It was 83 per cent! We could have gone abroad for a bit and avoided it — lots of bands did — but we were from working-class families and we had a social conscience.’ Success: Merry Xmas Everybody was Slade's third single in a year to go straight in at Number One in 1973 (after Cum on Feel the Noize and Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me) — something even The Beatles didn’t manage . Merry Xmas Everybody was their third single in a year to go straight in at Number One in 1973 (after Cum on Feel the Noize and Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me) — something even The Beatles didn’t manage. Yet as punk music took over in the mid-70s, Slade’s star faded. ‘Suddenly, we were boring old farts, playing civic centres again. By 1980, we were pretty much finished.’ And then Ozzy Osbourne dropped out of the Reading Festival, Slade filled in and the crowd went berserk. ‘It changed everything. We had a second wave in the Eighties.’ Noddy has always been a big believer in ‘what goes around comes around’. ‘I love everyone on sight, and you’d have to do something really bad for me to turn nasty. ‘I have never knowingly lied, or done anything nasty to anyone, or even nicked anything.’ He even gets on with his first wife, Leandra, with whom he has two daughters. He claims Leandra was one of the biggest supporters of his budding romance with his second wife, Suzan, a television executive and journalist whom he met when she was 24 and he was 43. They now have a 19-year-old son, Django. ‘I never chucked a telly out of the window, but I did drive a car into a swimming pool once. Well, nearly. It was teetering on the edge, anyway. ‘And we never went short of women. Marc Bolan got all the screamers, but we got our fair share.’ And, latterly, it transpires, a lot of letters from people claiming to be Noddy’s illegitimate offspring. ‘I used to have loads of people claiming I’d fathered them — loads! They’d write to the office — sometimes nice letters, often not. They all tried it on. You just had to ignore it.’ And would he have remembered fathering them anyway? ‘God Almighty, no! Of course not. But it was rubbish. It was all about money. That’s all they cared about.’ Is there anything that gets him riled up? This is someone who was ditched by BBC2 series Grumpy Old Men because he wasn’t grumpy enough. ‘Oh yes, loads! Politicians, lack of respect for elders, people who talk in “quiet carriages”, cycling on pavements — that drives me crackers.’ Oh yes, and being asked if the original Slade will ever reform. (‘Never. I’ve toured the world 20 times already.’) Nor has he any intention of watching bandmates Don Powell and Dave Hill, who still tour as Slade II. ‘It’d make me feel funny to watch. I’d feel strange watching half the band doing the songs that the other half wrote. I didn’t really want them to carry on using the name, but it wasn’t worth going to court for, was it? Life’s too short for all that s***.’ Noddy Holder is one of the most content people you’ll meet. He seems remarkably unspoilt by success — and, as ever, looking forward to a strong drink. And another very lucrative Christmas. n The World According to Noddy (Constable, £5) is available from September 25 only at Sainsbury’s as part of their Book Club.","Noddy Holder, now 68, fronted glam rock superstars Slade .

"John Lewis has been accused of ‘sexualising toddlers’ after advertising bras for two-year-old girls. Charities and campaigners last night condemned the department store as a ‘disgrace’ for selling replica women’s underwear to fit children aged between two and five. The £8 ‘vintage floral bras’ attracted dozens of complaints from mothers, who branded the supposedly family-orientated retailer ‘disgusting’. Scroll down for video . Toddler-sized: The floral bra in a 28A actually measures just 20 inches around the chest, which is slightly smaller than the average two-year-old . They were sold both in store and online as part of John Lewis’s ‘Girl’ range. Following the outcry, the collection was removed from the retailer’s website and later put back on with what the retailer says was the correct sizing. A spokesman insisted it had been a mistake and that the bras were meant for girls aged 11 and older. But the cotton bras, which are still being sold in stores, are alongside matching vests and knickers in the same fabric which start at two years of age. They also measure only 20 inches around the chest in the smallest size – which is actually slightly smaller than the average two-year-old. The knickers in the matching pink and white floral pattern state clearly on the label that they are for two-year-old girls. The news comes as Prime Minister David Cameron this week promised a crackdown on sexualised images of children on the internet. Siobhan Freegard, founder of the UK’s biggest parenting website Netmums, said last night: ‘There is no need for a bra measuring 20 inches. It’s unnecessary and unsavoury to ask tiny girls to dress in replicas of women’s underwear. 'Unsavoury': The bra alongside matching vest and knickers, which has since been removed from the website . Advert: Website shows the bras being retailed for girls aged '2 years' through to '5 years' but John Lewis said it was a mistake and they are intended to be sold for girls aged 11 and over . ‘Some may try to justify it saying it’s for little girls who want to copy their mums, but we shouldn’t be encouraging toddlers to be body-conscious.’ Claude Knights, chief executive of the charity Kidscape, agreed, adding: ‘Bras and two-year-olds in the same sentence just doesn’t compute. If this is so, it is unacceptable and very disturbing. ‘If you spoke to any mother or father of a child of that age, it would be out of their orbit of thinking.’ Mothers on parenting forums described the products as ‘wrong’ and ‘dangerous’. One wrote on Mumsnet: ‘The sexualisation of small girls makes me so sad. ‘Childhood seems to be something we get nostalgic about, not something we allow children to actually have any more.’ And a user called Percy posted on the BabyCentre forum: ‘They do matching knickers too ... I am flabbergasted! They’ve got a proper bra clasp! That’s a health and safety issue for a start.’ Parents also took to social media to condemn the store. Chris Sanderson wrote on Twitter: ‘A bra for a 2 year old?! Appalled at John Lewis.’ The £8 ‘vintage floral bras’ attracted dozens of complaints from mothers, who branded the supposedly family-orientated retailer ‘disgusting’ A spokesman from John Lewis said an error had occurred when the product was put on the website, meaning that it was categorised by age and not size, which is not how they would label underwear . This is not the first time the store, well-known for its heart-warming Christmas adverts, has been accused of selling inappropriate clothing for very young girls. One range sold on its website has girls’ clothes for ages 6 and up that are based on their adult collection. This range, by Mango Kids, includes skimpy black faux-leather hot pants which are dry clean only, a short denim mini-skirt and a pair of tight tweed shorts. Campaign group Let Clothes Be Clothes said they ‘weren’t surprised’ to find bras for toddlers. ‘This isn’t the first time we’d brought up the question of John Lewis selling sexualised clothing to young girls,’ said the group’s co-founder, Ruth Lopardo. ‘In fact, John Lewis Girl stands out as displaying some of the worst gender stereotypes we’ve found.’ The knickers in the matching pink and white floral pattern state clearly on the label that they are for two-year-old girls (pictured) A spokesman for John Lewis said it does not sell or condone the sale of bras to young children, adding: ‘Bras are designed to stretch, so our 28A bra will fit a 28-inch chest even if it measures at a smaller size when on the hanger.’ However, despite the label inside saying 28 inches – the chest size of a typical 11-year-old girl – when a Daily Mail reporter stretched the bra to its full capacity it only reached around 22 inches. The spokesman added: ‘We sell bras by size and not by age and the products are clearly marked in this way and labelled by size in our shops. An error occurred when the product was put on our website, meaning that it was categorised by age and not size. This was corrected straight away.’ Several other retailers have faced criticism in the past for selling inappropriate girls’ clothing. In 2010, Primark was forced to withdraw padded bikinis for seven-year-olds after the Prime Minister branded them ‘disgraceful’.","The £8 'vintage floral bras' were sold as part of John Lewis's 'Girl' range .

"Adrian Peterson's appeal of his NFL suspension in the wake of a child abuse charge has been denied, the league said Friday. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello issued a brief statement posted on NFL.com saying an appeals officer appointed by the league to hear the case had affirmed the season-long suspension handed out to Peterson after he pleaded no-contest to a reduced charge to avoid jail time in the severe spanking of his four-year-old son. Peterson, 29, was suspended by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on November 18, who said the Minnesota running back would not be eligible for reinstatement until April 15. Scroll down for video . Nothing to smirk about: Vikings running back Adrian Peterson's (seen here last month) season-long suspension was upheld on Friday by independent arbiter and former NFL executive Harold Henderson . Form of 'discipline': Peterson disciplined his son using a thin branch last May, leaving severe cuts, welts and bruises on his body. Photos of the boy's injuries (above) were later released by Houston Police Department . The league said Peterson's plea -- for smacking his son with a tree branch so hard that it created cuts, welts and bruises -- put him in violation of its personal conduct policy. Peterson, the 2012 NFL Most Valuable Player, has played in just one game this year, the Vikings' season-opener. The NFL Players' Association immediately responded, hinting it would take Peterson's case to court. 'The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL,' the union said in a statement. 'The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.' Previous appearance: Peterson, pictured laughing beside his wife, Ashley, in October, avoided jail but received probation, a $4,000 fine and 80 hours of community service for the 'discipline' of his son in May this year . Arbitrator Harold Henderson said in his ruling that Peterson, the 2012 NFL Most Valuable Player, 'has not demonstrated that the process and procedures surrounding his discipline were not fair and consistent.' Henderson added that Peterson 'was afforded all the protections and rights to which he is entitled, and I find no basis to vacate or reduce the discipline.' 'The facts in this appeal are uncontested,' Henderson wrote. 'The player entered a plea which effectively admitted guilt to a criminal charge of child abuse, after inflicting serious injuries to his four-year-old son in the course of administering discipline.' The arbitrator added, 'No direct evidence of the beating was entered in the record here, but numerous court documents, investigative reports, photographs and news reports, all accepted into evidence without objection, make it clear that Mr. Peterson's conduct was egregious and aggravated as those terms are used in the Policy, and merits substantial discipline.' Henderson is a former NFL executive vice president of labor relations who has heard 87 appeals since 2008 involving personal conduct and drug issues. Serving his sentence: The Minnesota Vikings running back, who pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault last month, was suspended for the rest of the season for violating the league's personal conduct policy . Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest on November 4 to misdemeanor reckless assault of his 4-year-old son, allowing him to avoid a felony child-abuse conviction. After Peterson's plea, Goodell suspended Peterson until at least April 15 for violating the NFL personal conduct policy. He was arrested in September on a felony child abuse charge for disciplining his son by repeatedly striking him with a thin tree branch called a switch.","Peterson appealed the suspension after accepting a plea agreement to avoid jail time in his child abuse case .

"John Shears, pictured, of Lower Nattadon in Devon is said to be among four men quizzed after a drugs raid on barns and outbuildings last week . A former National Farmers' Union chairman has been arrested and quizzed by police over an alleged cannabis farm. John Shears, 69, of Lower Nattadon, Chagford, Devon was said to be among four men quizzed after a drugs raid on barns and outbuildings. He is an unelected member of Dartmoor National Park Authority's Development Management Committee based at its headquarters in Bovey Tracey and a prominent farmer in the area. Police, who have not confirmed the identity of those detained, revealed that 189 large cannabis plants with a street value of £75,000 were taken away from an apparent drugs factory near Chagford on Thursday last week. Others questioned by officers at Launceston Police Station, Cornwall, after the swoop were a 25-year-old man from Kingsteignton, a 49-year-old man from the Chagford area and a 34-year-old man from Cullompton. All four were later released on police bail pending further inquiries, including analysis of the plants and growing equipment seized from the farm buildings. It is understood police hired a large vehicle to take away what they described as a 'significant' haul. Dartmoor National Park Authority confirmed it was reviewing Mr Shear's status as a member while the police investigation continued. A spokesman said: 'This matter is part of a police investigation. He is assisting police with their enquiries. 'We are reviewing his status as an authority member pending the outcome of the investigation.' West Devon police sector commander Insp Andy Oliver said: 'All those questioned were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production and supply of cannabis. 'Some 189 plants were taken away. They had an estimated street value of £74,800. This was a big operation.' He added: 'It was a significant find and comes on the back of one just a few weeks before in Okehampton where drugs and cash seized were valued at £100,000.' Former National Farmers' Union chairman John Shears is a farmer in and around Dartmoor (file picture) He said all four men would be questioned again by officers in August. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: 'A warrant was executed at a rural property in Chagford around 9.20am on May 7. 'Officers seized more than 100 suspected cannabis plants and suspected drugs equipment. 'Four men arrested on suspicion of production of Class B drugs. Aged 41, 34, 69 and 25 and from Chagford. All four taken into custody at Launceston and bailed until August 7.' Growing cannabis can attract a substantial prison sentence depending on the offender's role in the crime. Mr Shears has been an active member of the National Farmers' Union where he has served as a chairman and vice-chairman. He is also chairman of Chagford Commoners' Association.

"An 11-year-old Oregon boy was killed Thursday and his mother seriously injured after a tree collapsed on top of their car during the wild storms that battered the west coast. William Graham, a junior at Lake Oswego Junior High School, and his mom were trapped inside their vehicle following the accident in southwest Portland. Emergency crews were called to Southwest Terwilliger Boulevard near Castleridge Lane at 5.30 pm after a cyclist riding past saw the car.

"A California father-of-four has been booked on suspicion of murder and abduction after he allegedly killed his wife, kidnapped his sons and led police on a dramatic three-day manhunt that ended after an intense standoff. Daniel Perez, 43, was booked Friday into the Montebello police jail, about 15 miles east of Los Angeles, while prosecutors decide on formal charges. Investigators say Daniel and wife Erica Perez, along with their sons, ages 6 to 11, disappeared December 5 and were reported missing four days later, on Tuesday. The next day, police found Erica Perez's body in the trunk of the family's Honda Accord about a half-mile from their Montebello home. The cause of the 39-year-old woman's death has not been released. Scroll down for video . Father-of-four Daniel Perez (left), 43, is being held at a jail in Montebello, California, on suspicion of murdering his wife Erica Perez (right) and kidnapping their four sons, ages 6 to 11 . Police arrested Perez on Thursday as he tried to jump off a freeway bridge in Santee, California, following an intense standoff with cops in San Diego County . The Perez boys were rescued during a dramatic manhunt and have all been reunited with relatives. Pictured:  Jordan, 11, Jaiden, 9, Tristan, 8, and Alex, 6 . On Thursday, the California Highway Patrol issued an Amber Alert stating the children had been taken by their father. Montebello police activated an anti-theft tracker in the family's other car, a Toyota Camry, which alerted authorities to its location in San Diego County and triggered a pursuit shortly after 8 a.m. The Camry stopped on an elevated freeway ramp after a pursuit that lasted about 10 minutes and reached speeds of 85 mph, CHP Officer Kevin Pearlstein said. A police negotiator spoke by phone with Perez, a 43-year-old elementary school custodian, who released two of the boys. Police sensed a sudden change in demeanor and sent in armored vehicles from both directions to block the car, along with about 25 San Diego County sheriff's deputies. With television helicopters circling above, Perez got out of the car and walked backward to the railing of the 150-foot-high bridge with one boy at his side. During the highway standoof, police feared Perez would try to leap from the overpass with one of his sons . Police officers take away two Perez's boys after their father's arrest . Perez held a phone to his ear while the other boy followed a few steps behind. Police shot him with a beanbag round, Perez threw an arm and a leg over the railing, and officers rushed in to grab him. Perez's four children were not physically harmed and have been reunited with relatives. Police nabbed Perez after he tried to jump off a freeway bridge . Police say Daniel and Erica Perez had an unstable and at times violent marriage. Officers had been called to the family home in the past because of disturbances. Erica Perez had been convicted in March 2011 of misdemeanor corporal injury to a spouse and sentenced to 60 days in jail, authorities said. Daniel Perez had two trespassing convictions in 1996, and in 1999 he was charged with passing a check with insufficient funds but the case was dismissed, court records show.

Stockbridge believed she was being carefully and told her customers not to talk and would tell them to 'ssshhh' if they disobeyed the rules. Police installed 'optical' and 'listening' devices inside Stockbridge's car on September 5, 2013, and were recording evidence of the socialite handing over drugs for cash.

"Justice? Julie McElhiney was 13 when she was killed by Curtin Tucker in 1974. Jailed on Friday, he was given a maximum sentence of five years . The family of a 13-year-old girl received an unusual apology from a judge who was sentencing their daughter's killer. Alameda County Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman apologized to family members of Julie McElhiney for the lenient sentence he imposed 66-year-old Curtis Tucker for killing her 40 years ago. Tucker was sentenced on Friday but the rules under which he was jailed are those which were in effect in 1974, when Julie was murdered. 'I wish there was more that I could do but there's a reason they changed the law so crimes like this would get punished more severely,' Judge Goodman said. Goodman, who appeared to be on the verge of tears, told McElhiney's family members, 'Sometimes there's nothing I can say. I can't imagine the pain you've gone through.' The ex-felon was sentenced for five years to life for his second-degree murder conviction. Tucker looked straight ahead and didn't show any emotion when McElhiney's family spoke in court  and didn't make any comments before he was sentenced for killing Julie McElhiney at at her family's home in East Oakland 40 years ago. Tucker, who had prior convictions for sexual assault and burglary, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder on July 8, just before a trial was to begin on allegations that he sexually assaulted and murdered McElhiney. According to Oakland police, McElhiney, a sixth-grader at Sequoia Elementary School, was found  face down on the second floor of her family's apartment. She was taken to hospital in Oakland but was pronounced dead. An autopsy said her cause of death was blunt force trauma to her head. The coroner also found that she had been sexually assaulted. The case was only solved in 2012 when Tucker's DNA was found on the clothing that McElhiney was wearing at the time of her death. Disappointment: Sentencing Curtis Tucker to five years in jail in the Oakland courtroom, Judge Larry Goodman could only apologize to the family that the term wasn't longer saying he was bound by 1970s law . Jenny McElhiney, one of Julie's older sisters, said, 'I pray that we never repeat an era like the 1970s when the life of little girls meant so little and murderers walked free after five to seven years,' she said to KTVU News. McElhiney said if her sister were able to speak to Tucker, she would ask him, 'Why did you hit me hard in the head with a wine bottle, force me into a dressing room, throw me against the wall, wrap an electrical cord around my neck, force yourself into my body, the body of a child, fill a bathtub with water and throw my naked body into it?' Another sister, Kathy McElhiney, read a letter signed by all the family members. They said that the death of their sister left them 'greatly traumatized' for the past 40 years and caused 'immeasurable anxiety and suffering.' The letter also reveals a number of flaws in the investigation with the Oakland Police Department at one point accusing one of Julie's brothers for her death. The letter said McElhiney's younger sister, who was only 10 at the time and slept in the same room with McElhiney has experienced 'grief and suffering that have never abated' and never married or led a normal life. The letter said, 'We have grave doubts about justice and not protecting children from predators. We waited 38 years for this crime to be solved and what kind of justice is that?'","13-year-old Julie McElhiney was murdered in 1974 .

"A mother was insane when she drove her three children into the ocean and therefore not guilty of child abuse, a Florida judge determined on Friday. Three attempted murder counts were dropped against Ebony Wilkerson who showed little emotion during her appearance in a courtroom today in Daytona Beach, Florida. The 33-year-old was declared not guilty by reason of insanity on three counts of child abuse by Circuit Judge Leah Case. The judge ordered a hearing for December 16 to determine whether the woman should be involuntarily hospitalized for treatment or released with court supervision. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-four Ebony Wilkerson, 33, (pictured right) in the Florida court on Friday was found not guilty of her children's attempted murders by reason of insanity . Ebony Wilkerson, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest,  (pictured in March) has been found not guilty by reason of insanity for the attempted murder of her three children . A South Carolina mother was insane when she drove her three children into the ocean and therefore not guilty of child abuse, a Florida judge determined on Friday . Heroic bystanders grabbed the children who were being pulled into the current by strong waves on the Florida beach in March . It will also be decided at the hearing whether to allow Wilkerson contact with her youngest child, who was born while she was in custody, ClickOrlando reported. The judge and attorneys said the process was rare. 'This is kind of out of the ordinary, and we've been doing this a long time,' Judge Case said. Wilkerson (pictured in an earlier mugshot) told the judge on Friday that she would waive her right to a jury trial . After the hearing, assistant public defender Craig Dyer said he had been practicing law for 37 years, 'and this is my first time' participating in this type of hearing. The deal between prosecutors and Wilkerson's attorneys was reached this week after a psychologist hired by prosecutors agreed with a defense psychologist that Wilkerson had a psychotic break during the incident. Wilkerson, of South Carolina, drove her van into the surf off Daytona Beach, Florida on March 4. One of the children fought with Wilkerson over the steering wheel as the car was entering the water and was able to lower the windows to call rescuers' attention. Bystanders and officers pulled her and her children - aged three, nine and ten, from the van as it was pulled into the waves. Wilkerson, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, reportedly punched her belly after being taken into custody and had to undergo psychiatric treatment. She gave birth to a boy after her arrest. The child is in the custody of her husband, Lutful Ronjon. In 2005, Ronjon, who was at the time Wilkerson's common-law husband, was arrested for domestic battery after an argument between the couple over receipts. Her three other children have been in state custody since March. In October, a judge ruled she could send them pre-approved notes. During next week's hearing, the judge will consider testimony and depositions from psychologists who evaluated Wilkerson in the weeks after her arrest. Wilkerson told the judge on Friday that she would waive her right to a jury trial. She said she was mentally competent to make that decision and wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol. When the judge asked her whether she was thinking clearly, Wilkerson said, 'Yes, I am.' Wilkerson was released after her arrest and had been awaiting trial on $90,000 bail, according to Daytona-News Journal.","Three attempted murder counts were dropped against Ebony Wilkerson in a Florida court on Friday .

"Hundreds of people traffickers and drug dealers have been rounded up by European police in an operation unprecedented in scale, officials announced. Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) played a big role in Operation Archimedes, which over the past nine days has seen more than 1,000 arrests in a continent-wide sweep against organised crime. The operation was carried out in more than 300 cities, ports, airports and border crossings and involved 20,000 policemen from all 28 countries of the European Union and six non-European countries. Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) played a big role in Operation Archimedes, which over the past nine days has seen more than 1,000 arrests in a continent-wide sweep against organised crime . Crime sweep: The scale of Operation Archimedes was unprecedented . Police identified 200 victims of human trafficking and saved 30 Romanian minors from trafficking. Some faced forced worked in prostitution or begging gangs, Europol, Europe's police organisation, said. 'It's the single largest coordinated assault on organised crime ever seen in Europe,' Britain's Rob Wainwright, the head of Europol, told a news conference at the organisation's headquarters. He said the operation was made necessary by the increasing sophistication and interconnectedness of Europe's crime groups, many of whom were using the hard-to-monitor 'dark net' - or encrypted internet - to communicate with each other. 'Months in the planning, it was a carefully coordinated series of attacks on key nodal points and crime sectors that underpin the underground crime economy in Europe,' he said. 'What we have seen emerging is an integrated underground criminal economy,' he said. Police identified 200 victims of human trafficking and saved 30 Romanian minors from trafficking . Arrests were concentrated on criminal middlemen and go-betweens, as crime kingpins are not typically caught in sweeps but in operations designed to ensnare them. Dubbed 'Operation Archimedes', 1,027 arrests were made between September 15 and 23. Authorities seized 599kg of cocaine, 200kg of heroin and 1.3 tonnes of cannabis. The operation yielded leads that would result in further investigations and arrests, Europol said. Authorities in United States and Colombia also helped in identifying new drug trafficking routes to Europe, including drugs increasingly being shipped in parcels sent by post. An NCA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We have been involved in Operation Archimedes, sharing intelligence and working to help disrupt criminal activity. 'Serious organised crime doesn't recognise boundaries - cybercrime for instance affects everyone - so we have to have a joint approach to tackle it. We all need to work together to protect ourselves. No UK nationals have been arrested so far as we're aware.'

"Rob Ford's sister revealed to police the Toronto mayor smoked crack cocaine with her one night in April, according court documents that indicated the cancer-stricken politician is now being investigated for drug possession. The documents released Wednesday said Kathy Ford was twice interviewed by investigators after reports surfaced last May of a video allegedly showing the mayor smoking crack in his sister's basement during a party. Reports of that video prompted Ford to enter rehabilitation for two months, capping a year of scandals that began when news stories surfaced of a first recording apparently showing the mayor smoking crack. Scroll down for video . Incriminating photo: A still image from a video surreptitiously shot by a drug dealer on April 26 and obtained by The Globe and Mail showing Toronto Mayor Rob Ford holding what appears to be a crack pipe . Ford, who has doggedly refused to resign amid the mounting controversies, dropped his re-election bid earlier this month after being diagnosed with a rare and tough to treat form of abdominal cancer. His brother, Doug Ford, is running in his place against two major opponents in the October 27 election. Police said they believe the latest video was recorded on April 26 by Michael 'Jugga' James, whom Kathy Ford said sold drugs to her and her brother that night. She also said Ford was drinking with his friend, Alexander Lisi, who is facing drug and extortion charges. The documents, released by Ontario Superior Court Justice Ian Nordheimer, were filed by police trying to obtain a search warrant for three of James' cellphones, which they believed might contain footage of the night in April. In the filing, Detective Constable David LaVallee wrote that the video could 'provide evidence of... drug possession against Robert Ford,' and drug trafficking and drug possession by James. Rob Ford has not been charged with any crime. Toronto Police spokesman Mark Pugash declined to comment on the documents, saying the investigation into the mayor's conduct, dubbed Brazen II, is ongoing. According to the documents, Kathy Ford told police that her brother arrived at her house 'intoxicated' but not 'high,' and that he was drinking and 'kidding around fighting' with Lisi in her home. Earlier reports claimed that the mayor had assaulted his friend Lisi. 'Kathryn Ford and Robert Ford were smoking crack cocaine that night,' the documents state. 'Lisi was not doing drugs.' Kathy Ford's grown daughter was asleep upstairs during the drug-fueled party. Lisi has been charged with extortion related to attempts to retrieve the first crack video, whose existence was reported by the Toronto Star and the Gawker website in May 2013. Ford was inhaling crack when he was secretly photographed with a pipe in his hand by James, said his sister. The 20-year-old allegedly planned to sell the incriminating tape to media outlets for a six-figure sum, Toronto Sun reported. Kathy Ford's version of events also has called into question some of James' claims made in an interview with the Toronto Star.The 20-year-old had accused the mayor of hurling racially charged insults at him and tossing pennies at his feet as a sign of disrespect. The Globe and Mail reported in May that it had seen the second crack video. The newspaper published still photos of the video, saying it paid $10,000 for them. Lisi was also charged in October 2013 with trafficking in marijuana, possession of proceeds of crime, possession of marijuana and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence during the investigation into Ford.","Kathy Ford was interviewed twice by police after reports surfaced in May of a video showing the mayor with a crack pipe .

"Peruvian security forces have dynamited 54 airstrips run cocaine smugglers in a futile attempt to stop secret flights in and out of the country. The runways are hidden across the flood plain of the vast Apurimac and Ene river valley in the South America nation. While the bombings cut in the profits of the traffickers, they often pay villagers around £60 each to fill the holes so flights are unaffected. Peruvian security forces are using dynamite to damage airstrips used by cocaine smuggling gangs . The soldiers plant the explosives deep in the ground at one of 54 runways found in a coca-rich valley . The explosions create huge craters, but the traffickers pay local villagers up to £60 each to refill the holes . The 500m-long landing strips are clearly visible from the special forces' helicopter on their approach . As authorities wound up a 54-airstrip 'cratering' mission, Peru's counter-narcotics police chief General Vicente Romero told reporters that two of the landing strips targeted in the latest operation have each been repaired four times this year. He also revealed that the 500-meter airstrips are occasionally fixed overnight. The area is the world's number one coca-growing valley in the world, with traffickers pocketing thousands of pounds for every Bolivia-bound flight. Four or five small planes fly daily into Peru from Bolivia, picking up about 300kg each of coca paste, which is worth about £200million in Bolivia, where it is further refined, authorities say. General Romero says pilots earn between £6,000 and £15,000 per flight. The border has no radar coverage and the neighbouring nations' air forces are limited so drug flights can only be intercepted on the ground. General Romero said 14 planes have been seized this year.

The so-called air bridge between Peru and Bolivia has been especially active since 2011, the year before the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the United Nations said Peru surpassed Colombia as the world's top cocaine producer.

"Manchester United are back in the midst of another defensive injury crisis amid fears that Marcos Rojo could be out for six weeks with a dislocated shoulder. Rojo was carried off on a stretcher during United’s Manchester derby defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and needed oxygen at one point. Further rests have confirmed the defender’s injury is a full dislocation and the recovery time could be six weeks or even longer. The exact timescale will depend on whether Rojo has torn or merely stretched the ligaments that usually hold the shoulder in place. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal call Chris Smalling stupid for getting sent off . Manchester United's Marcos Rojo is facing up to three months out injured after dislocating his shoulder . The 24-year-old was carried off on a stretcher and will be missing for at least six weeks . The versatile defender seemed to be in some pain when he was carried off against Manchester City after receiving around two minutes' worth of treatment. It was something of a surprise, therefore, to see the 24-year-old play down the injury on Twitter the day after the derby. 'Gracias a todos por los mensajes. Gracias a dios fue solo un mal momento/ thank you all for your messages. thank god it was nothing,' Rojo wrote. United believe Rojo, who speaks only limited English as he has only been in the country for just over two months, made something of a mistake in his translation of the Spanish part of his tweet. 'Solo un mal momento' translates as 'only a bad moment', rather than 'nothing', and the club believe the defender's injury is serious. Rojo was discharged from hospital on Sunday evening and the club confirmed that the defender had suffered a dislocation. Rojo’s father appeared to confuse matters last night when he told a TV station in Argentina: ‘The injury is not too severe. He will miss two or three games.’ However, senior sources at Old Trafford confirmed yesterday that the injury was a dislocation and it seems improbable the £16million signing could recover that quickly. This means United manager Louis van Gaal will have to plan for the coming weeks of the campaign without the man he bought from Sporting Lisbon in the summer. With fellow central defenders Phil Jones and Jonny Evans struggling with injuries ahead of Saturday’s Barclays Premier League match with Crystal Palace, and right back Rafael da Silva also on the sidelines, Van Gaal is expected to ask midfielder Michael Carrick to fill in. Sportsmail revealed last month that Carrick had been told by Van Gaal to prepare for defensive duties on his return from his own long-term injury troubles. The England international midfielder went straight into the centre of defence when he came on at City on Sunday and is ready to do so again against Palace. The news comes as a further blow to Louis van Gaal (right), who is struggling with defensive options . Carrick said: ‘That position is not something I have played an awful lot. I have had spells of it, playing two or three or four games in a season. ‘But if I need to play there then fine. I have not had a lot of football recently so I will play anywhere, I don’t mind. ‘Ideally we just need to get players fit and have more options to choose from.’ United began the season with a host of injuries at the back, prompting Van Gaal to hand debuts to Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair. Those problems were starting to ease but with Chris Smalling serving a one-game ban after a red card on Sunday, the United boss is back to square one. Michael Carrick featured for the first time this season for Manchester United against Manchester City . On Monday night Carrick could only hope things will turn United’s way. ‘We look at the points total and we are bitterly disappointed with the amount we have got,’ he said. ‘It is nowhere near good enough for where we want to be. But if you look deeper there are signs we are still going to have a good season. ‘Overall the feeling is we are still building to be successful and I think we will be. Points wise it might suggest we are not close to Chelsea and Manchester City but you look at the Chelsea game, I think we deserved the win. ‘Against City we also felt we deserved more, but that is the way it is going. We are experienced enough to know that points are what you are judged on. ‘It is up to us now to have a big push and put ourselves right back up there again.’ VIDEO Old Trafford defensive crisis for Van Gaal .

"As the Wicked Queen in Snow White, Jerry Hall was always meant to be the villain. But she found herself on the wrong side of the audience for an entirely different reason – when she mimed all her musical numbers in her pantomime debut. Angry patrons branded it ‘a complete joke’ and ‘beyond ridiculous’ that the model lip-synced to a track of her own voice. She couldn’t even do it well, they claimed, and often had her mouth closed when she should have been singing. Angry patrons branded it ‘a complete joke’ and ‘beyond ridiculous’ that Jerry Hall mimed while playing the Wicked Queen in Snow White at the Richmond Theatre in London . Others roguishly suggested she could have asked ex-husband Sir Mick Jagger for singing tips, rather than disappoint fans who had paid up to £56 per ticket. Some said her fee for the evening’s show should be withheld. Whatever her issues with sound, the 58-year-old at least looked the part in a glitzy thigh-split gold gown for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at Richmond Theatre in south-west London. But despite having performed at this year’s Glastonbury Festival, Miss Hall did not seem to trust her voice. The production team confirmed a backing track was used, saying it was too hard for Miss Hall to dance and remember her lines without it, and that it was ‘common practice’. Some suggested she could have asked ex-husband Sir Mick Jagger for singing tips, rather than disappoint fans who had paid up to £56 per ticket . Miss Hall, a patron of Richmond Theatre, did have a few friendly faces at Thursday’s show, in the form of Jagger and three of their four children – James, 29, Georgia, 22, and Gabriel, 16. Their eldest daughter Lizzie, 30, was not there. But others were less impressed by the star, whose acting credits include a part in 1989’s Batman. Jane Clarkson, from nearby Twickenham, said: ‘I am appalled, I have spent a lot of money to bring six children to see an all-singing, all-dancing show and for Jerry Hall to mime, and to mime badly, was a complete joke. Couldn’t her former husband have given her some lessons? I’m really not happy.’ Wendy Herbert, of Richmond, added: ‘My daughter kept asking what was going on.’ Maria Valeras, also from Richamond, said: ‘It’s not a modelling shoot and for her not even to be able to mime to a track of her own voice is beyond ridiculous.’ Miss Hall is no stranger to the stage, having previously starred in a production of The Graduate – to mixed reviews. One said she was ‘as wooden as a toothpick’. The criticism has never seemed to faze her, however. This year she said she was ‘thrilled’ to be in Snow White, adding that she and Jagger used to take their children to the Richmond panto every year. The production team said using backing tracks ensures that ‘every theatre-goer has the very best experience’ for 12 shows a week.","Model angers fans who paid up to £56 a ticket by lip-syncing during show .

"It is the fragrance that's supposed to capture the very spirit of David Beckham - one of Britain's most celebrated style leaders. The Essence aftershave for men was launched by the former England footballer as a scent which conveys his 'sense of adventure'. But this Christmas the 39-year-old's product is being sold at budget chain Poundland for just over a third of the usual price – and apparently without his knowledge. Scroll down for video . The Essence aftershave for men was launched by the former England footballer as a scent which conveys his 'sense of adventure' The fragrance, which is emblazoned with Beckham's name, normally retails at £24.99 but can be bought for just £8 at the discount store until January. The Essence 75ml eau de toilette is part of the father-of-four's range by Coty. Shoppers at the chain have been snapping up the chance to buy the discounted aftershave in a promotion which requires them to spend £3 in one of the Poundland stores first. It would be hard to imagine that his wife Victoria, 40 – who rose to fame as 'Posh Spice' – would welcome the invited association of the Beckham brand with the bold budget store. Beckham – who together with fashion designer Victoria is worth over £210million – is better known for being linked to higher end names such as Sainsbury, Jaguar and luxury Swiss brand Breitling for Bentley. He has famously posed in his underwear for fashion house Giorgio Armani - and earlier this year promoted H&M's Bodywear range. The former midfielder is known to be heavily involved in all the fragrances that carry his name which also include the popular Homme and Instinct scents. The Essence which was launched by the star in 2012 has elements of grapefruit, lavender, cardmom and patchouli. It promises to be the essence that 'defines the man'. The fragrance, which is emblazoned with Beckham's name, normally retails at £24.99 but can be bought for just £8 at the discount store until January (stock image) A spokesman for Beckham said: 'We don't distribute to Poundland, they've obviously bought it from somewhere without our knowledge and we cannot stop them from doing that. 'The range is normally stocked in the bigger department stores like Boots for around £25. Poundland must be selling it at a loss as a way of getting people into their stores.' A surge in the number of shoppers seeking out bargains, has seen record sales at the thriving Poundland chain which has opened 60 new branches. It has reported that sales at its 528 stores have hit almost £1billion a year while it plans to expand its budget empire with a target of some 1,000 outlets. The discounter has even sought to win sun-soaked, ex-pat customers in Spain by opening stores in Malaga.and Torremolinos. The budget chain is also selling Victoria's perfume 'Intimately Beckham' for women in some stores for £8 – which is less than half of the recommended retail price of £20. Both fragrances can also be found at cut prices by other distributors. Amazon is selling The Essence for £9.95 and website Fragrance Direct for £9.99 while Boots has reduced the price of the product from £33 to £14.99 in a sale. Boots and Amazon have also slashed the price tag on the 50ml Intimately Beckham for Her and are both selling it at £11.99. A Poundland spokeswoman said last night: 'Everything is just £1 at Poundland. However, this is another amazing Christmas treat. The fragrance can't be bought separately.' A spokesman for David Beckham said that the discounted prices did not mean the fragrance was not a success. He said: 'The Beckham range sold by Coty is the most successful celebrity fragrance of all time. It has sold over 10 million units across the world to date.'","Beckham's Essence aftershave being sold for a third of its usual price .

"The daughter of University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban is once again in legal troubles stemming from a boozy brawl with a sorority sister over a Facebook post that ended in punches and a broken nose. Kristen Saban, daughter of the legendary Alabama coach, was being sued for $10,000 by fellow Phi Mu sister Sarah Grimes, who claims she was brutally beaten over a Facebook post following a night of drinking games. Back in March, a Tuscaloosa judge ruled that Saban was only defending herself and dismissed the lawsuit. But on Friday, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed that decision, saying that there is enough of a dispute about what happened for the case to move forward. The lawsuit, first filed in June 2012, has now been fully reinstated. Kristen Saban (left) is being sued by former sorority sister Sarah Grimes (right), who claims that she was brutally beaten by Saban in a boozy brawl during their their University of Alabama days back in 2010 . Kristen is the daughter of Nick Saban (pictured), the legendary football coach of the University of Alabama. Lawyers have said the legal battle is a private matter and that the coach is not involved . The fight happened in the wee hours on Aug. 29, 2010, after a night of drinking at Rounders, a local bar in Tuscaloosa. The two sorority sisters and five other girlfriends were hanging out in Saban's apartment when they began to bicker over a boyfriend. Grimes told Saban to 'shut up' and that 'others were tired of listening to her,' according to court documents. Grimes told Saban she 'needed to get therapy' because she was a 'psycho' — to which Saban fired back: 'Because that worked really well for you,' court records show. Saban then locked herself in the bathroom, and posted on her Facebook: 'No one likes Sarah, Yayyyyy!' That's where things get murky — which each of the sorority sisters claiming in legal papers that the other beat her badly. In her testimony, Grimes says that Saban 'used both of her hands and shoved her into an open door frame,' where she hit her head. Both Saban and Grimes pledged the Phi Mu sorority (pictured) at the University of Alabama in 2009 . In her version of the story, Saban (left) claims that it was Grimes (right) who attacked her and left her bleeding after they traded punches and scratches while intoxicated . Grimes says she put 'one hand on [Saban's] throat, one hand on her chest, and threw her back' to try to get away. But Saban bounced back on top of her and 'hit her in the face more than five times,' leaving Grimes bleeding 'all over the floor and all over herself,' running down her face and into her bra. Grimes later testified that she had 'extensive' injuries, including a swelling on her left temple and a black eye. Saban, on the other hand, tells a different story. She said in legal papersthat, after she posted on Facebook, Grimes rushed over to confront her and began banging on her door. Alabama football coach Nick Saban and his daughter Kristen Saban pose for a photo in 2010 . 'She was screaming at me to take it off and cursing, and I finally took it off, and I opened the door, and I showed her,' Saban testified, according to court records. 'I had my phone out, and I said, ""It's off. It's off."" 'And then she took both of her hands and put them around my throat.' Saban added there was 'just a lot of slapping and punching, not many [punches] landing, and scratching.' Her injuries including a broken nose and scratches on her back, she testified. In her suit, Grimes claims she was hurt so badly she suffered a concussion, an increase in migraine headaches, had nasal surgery and required psychological help. 'As a result of the beating and the head injuries Sarah Grimes sustained by Kristen Saban, Sarah has had repeated night terrors, anxiety, physical trembling, fears of dying from brain injuries, trouble sleeping, and intrusive recollections of the event,' the lawsuit said. Saban's lawyer argued that Grimes was responsible for her own injuries. The dismissal motion also said insurance covered Grimes' medical costs, so Kristen Saban shouldn't have to pay. Kristen Saban pleaded guilty to an unspecified offense before the university's judicial board but was not prosecuted criminally, according to the suit. It said she was required to undergo psychological screening and take an anger management class. A 2009 news release from the university about sorority recruitment identified both Grimes, of Pensacola, Florida, and Kristen Saban as new members of Phi Mu.","Kristen Saban, daughter of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, is accused of brutally beating a former sorority sister after a night of drinking in 2010 .

"A bullying sergeant who threatened to lock up a man for taking pictures of a dented car after a road smash has been condemned by a police commissioner. The traffic officer, who gave his name as Sgt Tony Wallace, seized the 26-year-old photographer's camera as he took pictures of the aftermath of an accident and told him: 'You're lucky I didn't knock you out.' He approached the man at the scene of the car smash in Churchdown, Gloucestershire, swore at him, and told him he would arrest him for obstructing a police officer, threatening to 'make your day a living hell'. Scroll down for video . A photographer who took this image of the aftermath of a car crash was told by a policeman he would 'make his life hell' This still from the photographer's mobile phone footage (his subtitles) shows the policeman taking his details . A still from the photographer's YouTube clip - the officer told him he was not allowed to take photographs . Today Martin Surl, Gloucestershire's Police Commissioner, said the officer appeared to have 'fallen far short of the behaviour expected and required' by the police. The incident began when the photographer, who does not wish to be named, took photographs of a damaged car after an accident involving an elderly woman, who had been taken to hospital before he got there. An hour later, the photographer walked past a dented car still at the scene, and was taking some photographs of it from the other side of the road when he was approached by Sgt Wallace. The policeman's aggressive attitude prompted him to film the episode on his mobile phone, and he later posted the footage on YouTube. The clip begins with the caption: 'He takes the camera out of my hands, . gets right in my face to the point where he’s spitting at me, swears at . me several times, says the camera is being seized and I am going to be . arrested for obstructing a police officer. The officer is seen demanding the photographer's camera and saying he can't have it back unless he deletes the pictures . The photographer insisted that the road was open to pedestrians when he took his pictures . 'After . about a minute or two of this confrontation I got my phone out but was . afraid he would seize this too.  However he didn’t, and I began filming . in a subtle way.' The Scottish-sounding officer is recorded telling the photographer: 'We’ll nick you now and I will make your day a living hell, cause you’ll be in that cell all day. 'What I’ll probably do is I will ask for you to be remanded in custody and I will put you before the magistrate.... and they’ll be like, what a t** you’ve been.' The officer can also be heard telling . the photographer: 'You’re lucky that I didn’t knock you out. I swore at . you, yeah. It got your attention, though, didn’t it?' The sergeant seized the man's camera, told him he had to delete the images on it, and then stood over him as he scrolled through them before agreeing he could keep them all. The man, who insists he only began . taking pictures long after anyone injured in the accident had left the . scene, later posted a 12-minute clip of the confrontation online. In the film, he stressed he had no knowledge of what had happened in the accident, and said he was merely taking photographs of a damaged car once the police tape around the scene had been removed. Today he said he believed he was being unfairly arrested when he was confronted by Sgt Wallace.'If I had gone through the police tape, then he should have arrested me, but I didn't: they removed the tape because they were packing up, you can see all the other people freely walking about. 'I thought I would take some pictures to submit to the papers. I thought it was a very minor incident and they papers might use a small thumbnail if they decided to run an article.' He added: 'Of course now I know it was not a minor event, and someone later died. But I didn't, and would never, take pictures of the victims or their family.' 'Because I hadn't captured anything insensitive at all, and he knew it, it made the entire 15 minute interaction completely pointless.' The YouTube footage, which has been viewed more than 10,000 times, includes a map of where the accident happened in Churchdown, Gloucestershire . Gloucestershire police commissioner Martin Surl, seen here with the force's Chief Constable, Suzette Davenport, has condemned the officer's actions . Today Gloucestershire police said the officer involved was now facing a misconduct probe. Mr Surl, a former police superintendent with Gloucestershire constabulary before he became Commissioner, said he had asked the force to investigate the matter ‘with the utmost urgency’. He said: 'It appears the officer involved has fallen far short of the behaviour expected and required by the Constabulary. 'I have only seen the public-facing evidence, but it appears the officer swore at a member of the public, followed that up by saying he was lucky not to have been assaulted by the police, threatened him with arrest, mistreatment and a remand in custody. 'I appreciate the work of the police can be very challenging, but no matter what the situation they should deal with the public in a civil and responsible manner at all times. 'It appears the officer swore at a member of the public, followed that up by saying he was lucky not to have been assaulted by the police, threatened him with arrest, mistreatment and a remand in custody.' - Martin Surl, Gloucestershire Police Commissioner . 'It is the responsibility of the Chief Constable to manage complaints against police officers; my role is to hold the police to account.' Mr Surl added: 'I hope this incident will not cause the public to lose faith in the good work done every day by the majority of hard working, dedicated officers which is why I have asked for this issue to be dealt-with with the utmost urgency.' The amateur photographer posted the video hours after the incident on 19 November and it has been viewed more than 10,000 times. He said: 'I turned up there and I started taking pictures.  It’s round the corner from where I live and I thought as I was local, I might as well get some photos. I know I’m allowed to take pictures on public land. 'At the time there was no police tape cordoning off the road, the ambulance had gone, everyone had gone.' The 86 year-old woman who was knocked down was treated at the scene but died later at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol. Gloucestershire police said: 'All police officers in Gloucestershire take an oath to ‘serve the public with respect to all people’. 'Any officer found to breach this oath or any allegations or complaints made about officers are thoroughly and robustly investigated.'","Aggressive officer confronted man taking pictures after a road accident .

"It's a hair-raising experience that is all in a day's work for the world's best surfers: riding a 42ft wave that threatens to crash down on them at any moment. And this is the breath-taking moment that one of the thrill-seekers narrowly avoided being crushed by a gigantic wave off the coast of Portugal, where the sport's top athletes have gathered to ride massive waves in front of hundreds of spectators. The unidentified surfer was unscathed when he made it back to the beach at the small fishing village of Nazare, where US surfer Garrett McNamara set the world record for riding the largest wave - an astonishing 98 feet - in January 2013.

This week, the giant waves have once again lured Mr McNamara, along with the UK's Andrew Cotton, Australia's Ross Clarke Jones and France's Benjamin Sanchis. Mr Cotton, a former plumber from Devon, said that he expected the swells to be the largest of the year at the notorious big wave spot. Two weeks ago the fearless surfer wiped out and was engulfed by a 60ft wave as he attempted to break the world record. He escaped with a minor arm injury. Surfing's big wave elite came out to try their luck at Praia do Norte in Nazare, Portugal, beginning December 11 . As a surfer races along the swell, the powerful crashing water threatens to engulf him . US champion surfer, Garrett McNamara, pictured here, set the world-record for largest wave ever ridden in January 2013 . Spectators and photographers alike attempt to get a glimpse of the surfers through the gigantic cloud-like waves . The weather forecast predicted three days of solid swells off the northwest coast, with waves as high as 41ft on the first day. The massive swells are caused, in large part, by the region's geography. Off the Praia do Norte coastline is the biggest underwater ravine in Europe, called Nazare Canyon. The huge canyon runs 125 miles, from out in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to less than half a mile from the coastline. Praia do Norte is also among one of the most westerly points in all of Europe, meaning the wind sweeps across the Atlantic unhindered .

"Thousands of Algerian soldiers supported by helicopters are hunting for the ISIS-linked Islamist terrorists who beheaded a French mountaineer in a sickening video released yesterday. Herve Gourdel, 55, was captured by the Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa while hiking in the Djurdjura National Park on Sunday - just one day after he arrived in Algeria for a 10-day walking holiday. Mr Gourdel was brutally murdered yesterday, less than 24 hours after militants uploaded a video to YouTube warning that the married father-of-two would be killed unless France pulled out of a coalition of nations bombing targets connected to the ISIS in Iraq. By early this morning some 2000 soldiers were involved in the search in the Tizi Ouzou region, along with 500 marines supported by sniffers dogs. 'Everything will be done to bring the killers to justice,' said a spokesman for Algeria's Defence Ministry. The news came as France's defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian revealed his country is considering whether to expand airstrikes into Syria to assist a U.S. and Arab coalition in thwarting ISIS' advances. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Herve Gourdel, 55, (pictured right, holding a water bottle) was captured by the Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa while hiking in the Djurdjura National Park on Sunday - just one day after arriving for a walking holiday . Experienced: Herve Gourdel (pictured left and right) was a passionate amateur photographer and married with two adult children. He worked as a mountain guide and had vast experience of working in remote locations . Execution: ISIS-linked militants in Algeria beheaded  Herve Gourdel yesterday after he was captured at the weekend. The group earlier made threats to kill Mr Gourdel if France did not stop bombing targets in Iraq . There are 30,000 French citizens living in Algeria, where Mr Gourdel was brutally murdered yesterday by militants loyal to ISIS - the terror group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi which controls a swath of territory larger than Britain and a population of four million brutally oppressed citizens. Asked about the  French citizens living in Algeria, Mr Le Drian told RTL radio that the goal of the extremist groups is to 'spread terror.' The Algerian government last night reiterated its commitment to protecting foreign residents living inside the country. There are fears that other radical Islamist groups may carry out copycat attacks on Westerners following calls to do so by ISIS on Sunday. The kidnapping and murder of Gourdel, however, is believed to be a crime of opportunity, since Algeria's extremist have been confined to remote mountainous regions and the French mountaineer was one of only a very few foreigners to venture into this area. This morning tributes were paid to the professional mountaineering guide, both from politicians and from locals in his home city of Nice, where a book of condolence was opened in his memory. Mr Gourdel - a passionate amateur photographer - was a married father of two adult children.

Residents of Nice sign a book of condolence for Herve Gourdel, who was murdered in Algeria yesterday . Threats: A video featuring Mr Gourdel was released on Tuesday in which the militants threatened to kill the Frenchman unless France stopped bombing ISIS targets in Iraq within 24 hours . 'Network of death': Mr Gourdel's murder came just 30 minutes after U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech to the UN General Assembly, urging the world to unite to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and its affiliates . The sickening four minute 46 second video of Mr Gourdel's murder - titled 'A Message in Blood for the French Government' - was released exactly 30 minutes after Barack Obama gave a speech vowing to destroy ISIS and its affiliates to the UN General Assembly. In his speech President Obama urged the world to come together to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and 'dismantle this network of death'. The address ended at 10.38am New York time, with the existence of Mr Gourdel's murder video revealed just 30 minutes later, at 11.09am. Yesterday afternoon the terrorism watchdog SITE Intelligence Group distributed a video by Jund al-Khilafah announcing Mr Gourdel's death. Images of the execution emerged on social media a short time later, showing the mountaineering guide wearing a purple T-shirt surrounded by masked men, with his hands bound behind his back. Tragic: Herve Gourdel, 55, was captured by the Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa while hiking in the Djurdjura National Park on Sunday - just one day after he arrived in Algeria for a walking holiday . Experienced: Mr Gourdel was a professional mountaineering guide and amateur photographer. Although he enjoyed spending time in remote locations around the world, he was always extremely careful, friends said . The video shows French text, which translates to English as  'BLOOD MESSAGE FOR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT'. It then shows Gourdel kneeling with his arms tied behind his back before four masked militants. Two have assault rifles. Gourdel appears to have a gash on the front of his throat. He appears calm. One of the men, reading from a script, says: . 'Here is criminal France that is full of hatred for Muslims, coming to us with a new dress. The aggression on the Muslims in Mali was not enough for it, and before that in Algeria, where it destroyed and sowed corruption in the land, violated honor, fought whoever converted to Islam with its laws, prevented the hijab, spread vice and corruption, and killed the Muslims and displaced the weak. 'And today it refused to see the Shariah of Allah be applied in the land, the implementation of proscribed punishments, and the religion be spread. 'So it came with its horses and men to participate in this Crusader war under the pretext of terrorism, as they allege.' 'Let the French people know that their blood is cheap for their president, and it is the same as you made the blood of the Muslim women and children cheap in Iraq and Sham [Syria] and other countries. 'Your blood has been cheapened as an exact recompense.' The militants then push the victim on his side and hold him down. The video does not show the beheading, but a militant holds the head up to the camera afterwards. Just before the militants gave their statement, the Frenchman briefly addressed his family. On Tuesday a video posted on YouTube  showed the white-haired, bespectacled Mr Gourdel surrounded by masked men holding Kalashnikov rifles. The group threatened to kill their hostage by the end of the day unless France ceased its air strikes in Iraq, where ISIS terrorists control vast swaths of territory under the guise of a 'caliphate'. The Algerian murderers referred to their group as Jund al-Khilifa - which means 'caliphate soldiers.' The footage prompted some 1,500 Algerian forces to comb through the restive, mountainous Tizi Ouzou region in the east of Algeria - desperately trying to save Mr Gourdel before it was too late. Speaking at the United Nations in New York, Mr Hollande said: 'France is going through an ordeal because of the murder of one of its citizens, but France will never give in to blackmail. 'France will never give in to terrorism because it is our duty and above all, it is our honour.The fight against terrorism must continue and be stepped up.' Politicians lined up to condemn Mr Gourdel's murder, all vowing to fight terrorism. Hunt: Tuesday's warning video prompted some 1,500 Algerian forces to comb through the restive, Tizi Ouzou region in the east of Algeria - desperately trying to save Mr Gourdel before it was too late . Dangerous location: Mr Gourdel was seized on Saturday while hiking in the heart of Algeria's Djurdjura National Park (pictured). The mountains have been a sanctuary for radical Islamists loyal to Al Qaeda since the 1990s . Terrorists fighting for ISIS in Syria are believed to have freed 150 prisoners in the group's de facto capital Raqqa in the hope it will convince America and its Arab allies to end a campaign of airstrikes. Desperate militants released the captives overnight, according to local activists, in the belief the move could encourage an anti-ISIS coalition of nations to focus their raids away from Raqqa. The militant stronghold is widely thought to be a base for the group's senior figures - including leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - and where British hostages Alan Henning and John Cantlie are being held. The 150 prisoners released by the group are all believed to have been arrested in recent weeks, suggesting they are most likely to have been locals accused of committing minor crimes. The news comes as a fresh wave of airstrikes from the United States and its Arab allies hit ISIS oil refineries overnight, killing at least 14 militants and striking at the heart of the terror group's funding. ISIS generates up to $2million a day from the sale of oil, employing highly trained engineers to extract thousands of barrels a day from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under the terror group's control. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: 'The support of the whole nation goes to Herve Gourdel's family. France will never give in.' MP Laurent Wauqiuez said: 'Barbarity cannot defeat the values of democracy.' Herve Morin, of the UDI party, tweeted: 'To Gourdel's murderers: You are monsters and you are hideous.' And the National Front's Louis Aliot said: 'All my thoughts are with the family of our compatriot, cowardly executed by the enemies of our civilisation.' Christian Estrosi, the deputy mayor of Nice who visited Mr Gourdel's family, said the whole country had been plunged into a period of 'national mourning.' He said Mr Gourdel's elderly parents and children were dealing with their loss 'with dignity, anger and an unspeakable pain'. Algeria, which won independence from France in 1962 following a bitter war of independence, is a hotbed of Islamic terrorism. The Tizi Ouzou region has been the scene of attacks by al Qaeda's North African branch, AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). They have been operating in the mountainous wooded area for more than a decade, since the end of the brutal civil war which decimated Algeria during the 1990s. On Monday, Islamic State (IS) issued an audio statement calling on Muslims everywhere to kill citizens of nations that have joined the fight against jihadist groups in Iraq. Spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani called on followers to 'kill a disbelieving American or European – especially the spiteful and filthy French – or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war'.","Sickening video showing murder of Herve Gourdel was released yesterday .

"Tickets are still available for the blockbuster Champions League match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich at the Etihad Stadium. An article on City's official website, posted on Tuesday morning, said a limited selection of single-seat tickets would be on sale from the stadium ticket office in the hours up to kick-off. We asked Ric Turner of fan site Bluemoon just why City fans weren't flocking to arguably the club's biggest game of the season so far against one of the giants of European football. Tickets are still available for Manchester City's crucial Champions League with Bayern Munich on Tuesday . A Manchester City spokesman said they expect the match to sell-out with an attendance of around 44,500. The capacity is reduced from the normal by UEFA regulations. CLICK HERE for more on the story . Manchester City take on Bayern Munich at the Etihad Stadium in the Champions League on Tuesday night. It should be a prestigious occasion, with the reigning English champions taking on their German counterparts, yet tickets remain on open sale and the attendance is likely to be under 40,000. So, why is there seemingly such apathy amongs the City support for such a high-profile game? Qualifying for the Champions League always seemed like the holy grail, competing with Europe’s elite sides on a regular basis, but now that we are actually there it feels like something of an anti-climax and it has failed to capture the imagination of City fans. One factor is the tedium brought about by the flawed Champions League structure and seedings system. For the second year running we were drawn in a virtually identical group with both Bayern and CSKA Moscow. This will be the sixth time in four years that we have faced Munich. It’s dull and monotonous playing the same teams over and over again. The Etihad Stadium will host Manchester City's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich on Tuesday . An online ground plan said a limited number of tickets were still available for the match. They are no longer available to purchase online but the club said sales would continue from the ticket office ahead of the game . There is also a general disillusionment with UEFA at present; indeed, the City fans will stage a protest prior to kick-off on Tuesday evening. The main grievance relates to the away tie in Moscow, played in October. UEFA insisted that the game be played behind closed doors, leaving many City fans who had already paid for flights and hotels out of pocket and unable to claim compensation. To add insult to injury, around 350 CSKA fans were in the ground for the game regardless, making a mockery of the punishment. Their fine for racism and crowd trouble was eventually reduced to a paltry £79,000. City, meanwhile, were fined £49m for having the temerity to invest in their team and local community. However, the overriding factor is, of course, economical. City’s support is predominantly working class and many people simply balk at paying £40 to see a game of football. Particularly when it comes just three days after another home game, costing a similar amount. Once you factor in that the game is on terrestrial television, and that Christmas is a matter of weeks away, then it’s not hard to see why ticket sales have been sluggish. City must beat Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich who boast a 100 per cent record in the Champions League . Man City find themselves bottom of Group E, with just two points to their credit so far and two games left . The likes of Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes may well sneer, but as multi-millionaire footballers they lost touch with the economic realities facing most people a long time ago. Rival fans, too, will no doubt chortle about it on social media, although I’ve never really understood the obsession with attendances. Imagine being a grown man and mocking another club for the size of their crowds? I don’t feel superior to, say, a fan of Bury because they only get 3,000 at their games. You’d be an idiot if you did. Rather than resorting to cheap point scoring, fans across the country should be working together to address the real issues at hand here: namely the rampant commercialisation of the game, and exponential ticket price increases that are preventing many working-class fans from attending football matches.

"An army of 100 green-fanged spiders the size of tablespoons have invaded a young family's home. Dan Jackson and his three-year-old son Ruben are scared to go outside as 'tube web spiders' have filled every hole and crack in their garden and walls. The black creatures with shiny green fangs sew distinctive tube-shaped webs inside cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands. Now Mr Jackson, 29, is worried they may get into his house and harm his son, as their bites can cause a sharp injection-like pain. Scroll down for video . The spiders' bite causes a painful stinging sensation that lasts for hours. Pictured is one of the spiders nesting to the outside of Mr Jackson's home . Mr Jackson is concerned the spiders could move inside his home and bite his son Ruben (pictured together) The online trader from Southampton said: 'I'm not scared of spiders but even I'm freaked out by these ones. 'I first saw one when I went out into my garden and didn't think much of it. 'But when it got dark they all came out and there must have been more than 50 of them.' The official name for the spider is the Segestria florentina. While the pain from a bite can last for hours, their venom has no lasting effect on people. They are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps. Females reach a body length of up to 22mm and males up to 15mm. Mr Jackson said: 'My home backs onto woods so I think that must be where they have all come from. One of the tube web spiders that have invaded the outside walls and garden of Mr Jackson's home . Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm. Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year. They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours. They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it. Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique. 'I saw one that was the size of a tablespoon and I also managed to catch one after I saw it rush across my fence and then jump off onto the ground. 'It was playing dead and my brother said it was only a bit of dirt, but I put a glass over it and moved it a bit and it shot up. 'I let it go and it moved off so quickly it was unbelievable. As I said I'm not scared of spiders but these made me jump! 'I don't really know what I am going to do about them, but I know they bite so I worry about Ruben. 'I will have to speak to the council or get and exterminator out.' Sightings of the spiders have been more common in recent weeks as they usually occur from June to November. Tube web spiders are thought to have arrived in Britain around a century ago from the Mediterranean.","More than 100 spiders have infested the home of a Southampton family .

"Could Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter lead Europe out on the first morning of the Ryder Cup? That would create some noise among the spectators gathered in the wonderful amphitheatre that has been created around the first tee, wouldn’t it? McIlroy and Poulter were the fourballs partnership that changed everything at Medinah, of course, but Europe captain Paul McGinley will be all too aware of the perils associated with such a pairing as well. It might be a decade ago but nobody as steeped in Ryder Cup lore as the Irishman will forget what happened when the Americans paired Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in 2004. When they were beaten comfortably it was such a psychological blow it set the tone for a record-breaking defeat. Could Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter lead Europe out on the first morning of the Ryder Cup on Friday . Imagine what a boost it would give the visitors if a US partnership took down that talismanic pairing? A move that’s not without risk for McGinley, therefore, but one he appears to be leaning towards. One of those where you look like a genius if it works and get pilloried if it doesn’t. Two partnerships seem fairly set for the opening morning. Near neighbours Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose will almost certainly be partners, as will Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson. Two more players whose form this season warrants action on the first morning are Sergio Garcia and Martin Kaymer. Why not those two great mates Poulter and Rose? They are at their best in foursomes and will team up in the afternoon. The Americans? Again, two partnerships are cast in stone. Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson and Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson will see action. When Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson were paired at the 2004 Ryder Cup they were beaten comfortably . Who plays with Rickie Fowler is the big question and Jordan Spieth, at 20 the youngest player on either team, would be an exciting answer. If that goes well you could see the two of them playing all five matches. Veteran Jim Furyk would be a prosaic alternative, with Matt Kuchar and one of the rookies — Jimmy Walker or Patrick Reed — completing the morning line-up. By all means, play the game yourself at home. It’s Ryder Cup week. Everyone can join in. How do you counter all the songs of the European fans who will gather from first light around the first tee? The American players are hoping their supporters will follow the lead of their ‘soccer’ fans at the World Cup and adopt the chant: ‘We believe that we can win.’ American captain Tom Watson said: ‘There will be some noise out there.’ Yes there will. But it’s hard to see the Americans, who don’t really go in for singing, getting much of a look in. How Paul McGinley performs at the Ryder Cup could determine who is chosen as a  future European captain . VIDEO Pundits provide insight into potential pairings . When Paul McGinley was made Europe’s captain it marked a shift away from the recent tradition of skippers being either proven major winners or larger-than-life personalities. When Tom Watson was given the American equivalent, it ended the practice of the US captaincy being handed to distinguished former players whose careers had just come to a natural end. The fate of the two incumbents this week, therefore, will go beyond the usual cartoonish portrayal that sees one depicted as Captain Fantastic and the loser as Captain Cock-up. What happens at Gleneagles will go a long way to determining future captains on both sides. If Europe lose the clamour to turn the clock back and go for a Darren Clarke or a Padraig Harrington will be considerable. But if Europe win and McGinley plays a blinder, it will create a template and help considerably the chances of solid members of the tour citizenry like Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn. American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson said this they will use this tournament to make up for Medinah . America took a huge gamble with Watson. Knowing the players well, as McGinley does, is supposed to be a key part of the job but Watson will rule with brush strokes and rely on the respect he undoubtedly commands. How that works out could well determine whether his successor is another legend … or a McGinleyesque loyalist. QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘I’ve made it very clear to my team that this is a redemption trip. It’s time for us to make amends for what happened at Medinah.’ American captain Tom Watson spells out his theme. At Medinah last time it was the spirit of Seve that infused the European team. Here at Gleneagles Paul McGinley has ensured that popular coach Bob Torrance, his own mentor and someone who lent a guiding hand to so many before he passed away in July, will not be forgotten. Before any of his players left the practice range and went to the first tee at a tournament, Torrance would shake their hands and tell them: ‘Happiest days of your lives.’ Those are the last words any European player will see before he leaves the team room and makes his way to the first tee.","Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy could be paired together in Ryder Cup .

"British Muslims are being urged to wear a new ‘Poppy Hijab’ – as a challenge to extremist groups who ‘spout hatred’ about the Armed Forces. The scarf is backed by mainstream Muslim groups including the Islamic Society of Britain and profits from its sale will be donated to the Poppy Appeal. The scarf, which costs £22, will be launched tomorrow to mark 100 years since the first Muslim soldier was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the WW1. Ella Abubaker Farooq, 24 (left), Rukea Azougaye, 25 and Taslima Chowdhury, 21 (right) from London show off the new 'Poppy Hijab' in several styles . Khudadad Khan, a machine gunner in an Indian colonial regiment, fought on the Western front during WW1 in support of the British Expeditionary Force. Sughra Ahmed, President of the Islamic Society of Great Britain, said she wanted to take attention away from the ‘angry minority’ of extremists who spout hatred. Three years ago, a group calling itself ‘Muslims Against Crusades’ sparked outrage when it burned a poppy on Remembrance Sunday . Ms Ahmed said: ‘Thousands of British Muslims already wear a poppy in November. This is just another way for them to show they remember those who gave their lives for their country. ‘It’s also a way for ordinary Muslim citizens to take some attention away from extremists who seem to grab the headlines. ‘This symbol of quiet remembrance is the face of everyday British Islam – not the angry minority who spout hatred and offend everyone. ‘We’re launching this today as it’s exactly 100 years since the first Muslim soldier was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery – Khudadad Khan from Pakistan, who was fighting for Britain on the Western Front in the First World War.’ Sughra Ahmed, President of the Islamic Society of Great Britain, said he wanted to divert attention from an 'angry minority' of extremists who in the past have burned poppies on Remembrance Sunday (pictured) Khan was a member of the 129th Baluchis regiment fighting near in Belgium. On 31st October, 1914, at Hollebeke, Sepoy Khudadad carried on firing the gun on his own, after the five other men of his gun detachment were killed. Despite having been wounded, he fought on long enough to hold off an enemy advance until Indian and British reinforcements arrived. He was awarded the highest military award for gallantry by King George V in December that year. More than 400,000 Muslim soldiers fought for Britain in World War 1. Think tank British Future is promoting the scarf as part of efforts to remind the public about the role of Commonwealth soldiers in British military history. Sunder Katwala, the British Future’s Director of Integration said: ‘Remembrance brings Britain together each November - and has a special resonance as we all mark the centenary of the First World War. ‘The armies that fought a century ago look more like the Britain of 2014 than that of 1914. Yet few people realise that 400,000 Muslims fought for Britain in the First World War. ‘Many British Muslims won’t know this, while most Britons are surprised at the scale of the Muslim contribution to the Commonwealth effort.’ The scarf was designed by a Muslim fashion designer, Tabinda-Kauser Ishaq, a 24-year-old student at the University of the Arts in London. She said: ‘I hope the poppy headscarf gives Muslim women a new way to mark Remembrance Day and to help raise money for the Poppy Appeal. It’s a simple way to say you’re proudly British and proudly Muslim.’","£22 headscarf is backed by Muslim groups as a symbol for remembrance .

"Southampton have made a move for Belgium international Toby Alderweireld and hope to beat Monaco to a deal. Manager Ronald Koeman knows the Atletico Madrid defender well having seen him at close quarters while the 25-year-old plied his trade with Ajax in the Dutch league. Arsenal have also made enquiries to take him on loan from Atletico but the Belgium international is keen to leave Spain to play more games and knows he will get that chance more readily at Southampton rather than The Emirates. Target: Southampton have made a move for Belgium international Toby Alderweireld (left) Monaco are happy to do a permanent deal but the player is keen on a move to the Premier League and talks will unfold today. Koeman is also reviving his interest in Holland international midfielder Jordy Clasie and hopes to strike a deal with former club Feyenoord before the end of the week. The 23-year-old had been expected to join Porto but the delay has given Southampton encouragement as they look to add more creativity to their side. Rhodes hoping for Hull deal . Jordan Rhodes is poised to ask for a transfer to help push through a £12million move to Hull City. The Scotland international senses this could be his best chance of stepping up to the Premier League and the stability Steve Bruce has brought to the Humberside club reassures him it is the right move. Moving up: Jordan Rhodes is hoping to push through a £12million move to Hull City . Bruce, who also hopes to finalise terms with defender Michael Dawson from Tottenham, spoke glowingly about Rhodes on Sunday revealing how he thought a deal was done over the weekend. Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has held talks with owners Venky's after they rejected Hull's bid of £10million plus Alex Bruce for Rhodes. Blackburn issued a statement on Saturday confirming that they had rejected two offers from Hull and that Rhodes was not for sale but Bowyer needs funds to strengthen his squad and sacrificing the prolific striker may be the best solution. Hull have £12m to spend following the sale of Shane Long and are prepared to throw all of that at Blackburn to get Rhodes who scored in Saturday's 3-2 win over Bournemouth, his 54th in 100 appearances for the club. Manager Steve Bruce is desperate to bring in a striker. He has been rebuffed in attempts to bring in Danny Welbeck from Manchester United and believes Troy Deeney of Watford to be too expensive at £10m. Hull may reclaim some of their outlay if Wigan, among other, follow up initial enquiries in Yannick Sagbo. West Ham show interest in Wollscheid . West Ham have made enquiries for Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid. The 25-year-old centre-back was a target for Hull City boss Steve Bruce while Southampton have also expressed an interest prior to their move for Toby Alderweireld. Wollscheid is a Germany international and manager Sam Allardyce has made centre-back his priority position for recruitment over the coming days. Wanted: West Ham have made enquiries for Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid . Redknapp wants Diarra reunion . QPR will hold talks over a contract for Lassana Diarra on Monday. The 29-year-old has been sacked by Lokomotiv Moscow following a dispute with Lokomotiv coach Leonid Kuchuk which culminated in the France international refusing to turn up for training. Exasperated by the stand-off, the Russian club have taken action and Diarra is heading for London in the hope of signing again for Harry Redknapp. Sportsmail revealed Rangers' interest earlier this month with the sticking point Diarra's £80,000 a week salary. General: Harry Redknapp is looking to reunite with former Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra (right) However, he is ready to compromise his demands to push through a deal and link up with Redknapp who was his boss at Portsmouth. QPR are pressing to sign a goalkeeper also with Reading's Alex McCarthy their main target. They have also been offered Guingamp striker Mustapha Yatabare, 28, but a deal is unlikely at this stage. Manager Harry Redknapp will have to offload players before being able to bring any more in before Monday. He is keen to keep Loic Remy as the cost of replacing him with a similar calibre player would be more expensive than the £8m to £12m fee set out in his contract. Staying? Redknapp is still trying to hold onto French striker Loic Remy (centre) Everton in the money thanks to Forshaw's Wigan deal . Everton are due a £2million windfall on Monday as Wigan finalise the £4million purchase of Adam Forshaw from Brentford. The London-based club signed Forshaw on a free transfer with the caveat that they would give Everton 50percent of any sell-on fee. Forshaw was named League One player of the year last season and has blossomed under Mark Warburton. However, former boss Uwe Rosler has played a big part in persuading him to go to Wigan and he will join later today. Cashback: Everton are due a £2m windfall when Wigan secure a £4m deal for Adam Forshaw (above) Wigan are also looking to bring in a striker over the next 24 hours. They have been linked with Andy Delort of Tours who held talks with Brentford and Charlton while Southampton and Leeds scouts were also in attendance as he played for Tours against Ajaccio on Sunday. Tottenham looking to wrap up deal for Sevilla's Fazio . Sevilla sporting director Monchi says that the club have tried to keep hold of Federico Fazio but Tottenham have agreed to pay his buyout clause of £8million. Monchi said: 'It seems that Tottenham is willing to pay the [release] clause. 'We are waiting to see the money in the league. We are not going to negotiate with anyone because our desire is to keep Fazio in Sevilla. 'Two months ago we talked about his renewal, but it was not possible. When an English team appears interested in one of our players it is difficult because they can multiply player salaries . At the back: Vlad Chiriches (above) could be on the move as Tottenham eye Sevilla's Federico Fazio . 'We tried to renew him since last season but the distances were huge even if we were hoping to make a new deal.' Tottenham have also considered reviving interest in Swiss centre-back Fabian Schar of Basle as they await offers for Vlad Chiriches. Tottenham have told Southampton that winger Andros Townsend is not for sale despite an improved £12million bid being offered. Southampton will try again fro Nathan Redmond at Norwich but have other alternatives. Norwich are waiting news from Vidas Odjidje on whether he will join them this week after they agreed a £3million fee with his club Bruges. Di Maria edges closer to big money United move . Manchester United and Real Madrid held discussions over Angel di Maria's transfer on Sunday night with the initial meeting finishing at around 10.30pm. Further talks are scheduled on Monday as United try to reach a suitable accord over the fee. The clubs are also agreeing terms on United right-back Guillermo Varela. The 21-year-old Uruguayan only joined United a year ago from Penarol but will move to Real Madrid's B team Castilla to play under Zinedine Zidane. The deal is likely to be a loan with a view to a permanent £3million transfer. More developements are expected with Danny Welbeck soon. The England striker has interest from Everton, Sunderland, Tottenham and Newcastle among others while Galatasaray also want the 23-year-old. Big money: Angel di Maria looks set to seal a £75million deal from Real Madrid to Manchester United . Kalou attracting interest from Sunderland . Sunderland held talks with Salomon Kalou over the weekend. The 29-year-old is available for £4million from Lille. Gus Poyet was not too happy with the news coming out saying: 'I am going to have to do research at this football club into who is leaking information every week. 'It cannot be always the player’s agent. A few agents, okay, you can blame them, but there is too much information coming out and I don’t like it. I am not going to comment on any players, sorry.' Poyet is looking at loans and cheaper deals with the likelihood that if Fabio Borini joins it will also be on loan. That would mean they could not loan Sebastian Coates from Liverpool also. Former Chelsea forward Kalou has held negotiations with Wolfsburg also but they made it clear they would prefer Lukas Podolski. The Germany international though is waiting for Juventus to agree a loan deal with Arsenal. Return: Former Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou (right) is available for £4million from Lille . Borussia Monchengladbach have also spoken to the Ivory Coast international Kalou. Meanwhile, Modibo Diakitè could be looking to quit Sunderland and move back to Fiorentina as a free agent. Diakitè would have to buy out his contract with the Stadium of light club. Bolton eyeing Butland . Bolton are weighing up a loan move for Stoke City and England goalkeeper Jack Butland. However, the deal will hinge on Adam Bogdan who has been the subject of enquiries from other clubs but also picked up an injury in Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Brighton. The Hungarian keeper was injured in a 37th minute collision as Craig Mackail-Smith equalised at the Amex Stadium, leaving the field with a large gash above his left eye. Manager Dougie Freedman later revealed that Bogdan had also been knocked out in the accident and would have to be checked by a doctor before being allowed to play at Gresty Road against Crewe on Tuesday. Safe hands: Jack Butland (left) could be heading to Bolton on a season-long loan deal . Freedman said: 'Adam got a cut above his eye and got knocked unconscious so hopefully it will be a couple of days of rest and then back on Tuesday. We also have to check to see if his eye swells up or whether it has any effect on his vision.' Butland is not keen on dropping into the Championship but wants to play with Asmir Begovic entrenched as Stoke number one and heading for new contract talks. Wolves have made a £1million move for Chelsea midfielder George Saville who has been a target for Middlesbrough. Aitor Karanka could also face more disappointment after Reading became the latest club to move to sign Chelsea's Patrick Bamford on loan. Bamford has been a long-term target for Karanka as he looks to add more dynamism to his attack but has six clubs chasing his signature. Saville, who played briefly for Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett at Millwall has become an option after Wolves failed in a bid for Adam Forshaw at Brentford.

"Gareth Bale has targeted Champions League and La Liga double glory as he prepares to start the season in his native Cardiff. Wales star Bale will be part of a formidable Real Madrid strikeforce when the Champions League holders meet Europa League winners Sevilla in the Super Cup at the Cardiff City Stadium on Tuesday night. Madrid signed World Cup sensation James Rodriguez from Monaco for £63million this summer and the Colombian will join Bale, world player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema in the Madrid forward line at Cardiff. Focus: Gareth Bale wants more glory with Real Madrid this season . Ambition: The Welshman is hoping to win the double of La Liga and Champions League . Partners in crime: Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo will be key to any potential Real succes this campaign . Number one: Bale celebrates with team-mate Luka Modric after winning the Champions League Final in May . That firepower has convinced many pundits Madrid will become the first club to successfully defend European football's greatest prize in the Champions League era after their 10th title last season. 'Every season we want to win every trophy we're in for,' Bale told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff. 'We'll be trying our best to win the Champions League and the Spanish League again. 'It's great to be back home but the most important thing is to win the game and the cup. 'We need to focus on that and not on me playing in my home town. 'It was a great season last year winning trophies, but the most important thing now is to win the Super Cup and it doesn't matter who scores the winning goal. 'We'll work hard again to try and try to win the trophy.' A year ago Bale was waiting to complete his £86m world record transfer from Tottenham and the winger admitted he took time to settle at the Bernabeu after missing out on pre-season. But the 25-year-old insists he is in peak fitness at the start of this campaign, although he denied press reports that he had put on muscle. All smiles: Bale is clearly enjoying life as a Galactico . Homecoming: He is set to play on home soil with Real Madrid for the first time in the UEFA Super Cup . Showpiece: Madrid are set to face Sevilla at the Cardiff City Stadium on Tuesday . 'I haven't done anything,' said Bale. 'I've done a bit of training in the off-season, a bit of running. 'It was just pure conditioning training, I've worked hard in the off-season and feel in good shape. 'I've had a good pre-season and settled in. It's nice not being the new boy, that's been good. 'It's a lot easier having pre-season under your belt rather than waiting for a transfer to go through. 'I feel in better shape and can start the season with a better tempo. 'I don't feel pressure of being back home, it's another game and another one I have to put 110 per cent in to perform at my best.'Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti believes Bale will have an even greater impact for Madrid this season after a debut campaign where he scored 22 goals in 40 appearances and also netted in the Champions League final victory over neighbours Atletico. Belief: Real boss Carlo Ancelotti believes that Bale can go on to even greater things this season . New man: Bale running alongside new signings Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez in training .

"Andy Murray appears to have confirmed the latest left field move of his career by signing with American sports clothing firm Under Armour. The ex Wimbledon champion has been pictured wearing the skin tight top of the brand during his current training stint in Miami. As Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday, the US company have made an unexpected move for his major apparel deal after his five-year contract with Adidas was not renewed. Andy Murray was pictured wearing Under Armour clothing while posing for a picture with a young fan . The British No 1's five-year clothing contract with Adidas has not been renewed . They are best known in the UK for kitting out Tottenham Hotspur but their tennis involvement has been strictly limited. Among their few sponsorships in the sport have been Americans Sloane Stephens and Robby Ginepri. No formal announcement has yet been made but one is expected before Christmas. The financial commitment is likely to be a long way short of the estimated £3million annual payment from Adidas, partly because he seems sure to continue using their shoes.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has told outspoken Old Trafford legends Gary Neville and Paul Scholes they know nothing about what is happening at their former club. Van Gaal takes his team’s five-game winning run into Sunday lunchtime’s home game with Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League with Neville claiming United are defending like a pub team and Scholes saying he fears the best young talent in the North West will now head to Manchester City’s new £200million training complex. But United manager Van Gaal, who hit back at Neville in the week, said in response to Scholes on Friday: ‘That’s another legend, yeah? I think he has to pay attention to his words too.

"A great defender on the pitch, Sami Hyypia needs to find a way to protect his reputation off it. Whether he has the drive to keep on trying in his current position as Brighton’s manager is another question altogether. For the first time in Brighton’s plummet down the Championship table, the former hero of Liverpool’s backline is considering his future. That will certainly appeal to the significant section of the crowd chanting ‘we want Sami out’ in the second half of this baffling performance. Their anger is fuelled by a run of one win in 17 games; his own despondency came to the surface after watching his team batter a struggling side and emerge with nothing.

Goal: Gregory 15 . Booked: Shittu 18, Forde 57, Beevers 75, McDonald 82 . Referee: James Linington 5.5 (Isle of Wight) Asked if he would fight on, he said: ‘At the moment, straight after the game, I feel very frustrated. I think answering that kind of question I would maybe need some time. But usually I am not a quitter, I am a fighter.’ To think, this is a club that reached the play-offs in each of the past two seasons but now sits in the bottom three. Hyypia was given a vote of confidence at a board meeting on Tuesday, but for how long will that last? Certainly, he won’t get as many chances as his side had here. They dominated possession and still managed to lose to a 15th-minute strike from Lee Gregory, plucked from Halifax Town in the summer. ‘Best 250 grand I’ve spent in my life,’ said Ian Holloway. The booing for Hyypia started in the second half. ‘I think that is normal,’ Hyypia said. ‘Some of the fans are getting impatient. It doesn’t help. ‘I have always been prepared in my life for everything. I am prepared that I could have a car crash and never walk. In this job sometimes it is not going your way and you are in the situation. In my mind I am ready for it. (But) it is not nice at all.’ The Millwall supporters celebrate after Gregory put their side 1-0 up against Brighton on Friday night . Millwall goalkeeper David Forde needed treatment from his side's physio during the game . Veteran Forde (second left) flies out of his goal to challenge for the ball with Gary Gardner . Neither has it been too cheerful at Millwall. They had one win in 15 coming in and a 5-1 battering against Middlesbrough last time out. Here, they were happy to play the counter-puncher when they weren’t running down the clock. In Gregory, they had what Brighton apparently lacked – a man capable of putting a ball in the net. The 26-year-old’s finish after quarter of an hour was delightful. Scott Malone, as was often the case, was the instigator with a cross that Brighton failed to clear. The ball fell for Magaye Gueye, who miscued a shot into Gregory’s path and the striker chipped David Stockdale for his fourth goal in 10 starts. Darren Bent, on loan at the south-coast club, was unable to make a mark on the game . Gardner (centre) takes a tumble as he vies for the aerial ball with Martyn Woolford . The police line up next to the away end as the Millwall fans chant at the Brighton supporters . Brighton’s retaliation was to shoot on sight. Gary Gardner grazed the bar with a free-kick from 30 yards and Jake Forster-Caskey tried his luck from 25. The lack of deeper thinking was obvious. When Bent did get an opening after a Joao Texeira throughball in the 48th minute, he shot wide. His header eight minutes later was even less effective. Texeira also had a decent chance, as did Solly March. David Forde did not have to be at his best to keep them out; he probably did not need to resort to the time wasting that saw him booked in the second half.

We showed great character. We got things wrong in our last game and it goes down to performance and believing in ourselves. ‘We managed to settle, got in front and then proved we can defend. Let’s see if we can get two in a row. Onwards and upwards.’ What next for Brighton? They are not happy in these parts and regardless of the official attendance statistics, the fans are voting with their feet. Whether Hyypia walks with them remains to be seen.

"Blinded: Harvey Rowe was hit by debris after a railway detonator he and friends put on a fire exploded . A schoolboy has been blinded in one eye after an unmarked box of railway detonators he and some friends had put on a fire exploded. Harvey Rowe, 15, entered a railway depot through a broken fence with two older boys and took some rubbish from a skip to build the bonfire. When the unmarked box – filled with detonators used to warn maintenance crews a train is approaching in thick fog – started to explode as the fire started, he tried to kick it away from the flames. Debris flew into his face and he was taken to hospital where surgeons operated to remove the fragments. However, they later told his parents Claire, 45, and Mark, 49, that he had been blinded in his right eye. British Transport Police are planning to speak to Harvey when he has had time to recover. Officers have already arrested two 17-year-old boys on suspicion of theft and interviewed them before releasing them on bail. Mr and Mrs Rowe yesterday criticised Network Rail for leaving explosive devices where children could find them. Mother-of-four Mrs Rowe said: ‘Harvey is not the kind of boy who would go looking for trouble. ‘He’s predicted straight A-grades at school – we were just in  shock when we were told about  his injuries. ‘The doctors have told him he will never be able to see out of his  right eye again.’ Mr Rowe, a builder, added: ‘Network Rail has never had a problem with the kids grabbing crates  from there before. Scene: The remains on the fire could be seen at the skate park near Leigh-on-Sea, Essex . Theft: The teenager and two friends had thrown the box of explosives, . used as railway warning signals, onto a bonfire (file picture) ‘Now my boy’s been injured they’re accusing them of stealing explosives. Why were the detonators there in the first place?’ Harvey was out playing with the older boys near his home in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on Saturday night. He was discharged from Southend Hospital the following day. Speaking afterwards, with a  patch over his eye, he said: ‘We were building a small fire and just dumped a few bits from the skip  on there. One thing was an unmarked box but before we knew it, it started exploding. ‘We tried to spray the fire with water and I tried to kick the box off the heat but that was when I got hit in the face. Now I’m going to be paying the price for that mistake for the rest of my life.’ Railways detonators are used as a warning signal for train drivers. About the size of a large coin, the detonator is strapped to the top of the rail with metal straps. When . a train wheel passes over it, the device emits a loud bang to warn . drivers about a number of things including: dense fog, a train stopped . on the line ahead or ongoing engineering works. They are also used by signallers when they need to stop approaching trains in an emergency . The explosives can be dangerous if handled in the wrong way - throwing them onto bonfires for example. Large pools of blood could still be seen splattered across the concrete yesterday at the skate park where the teenagers built the fire. Skateboarders in the area described how the boys walked through a gap in a nearby fence which had been there for ‘months, probably years’. One said: ‘I don’t know why they didn’t fix the fence before. ‘What he did was stupid but why the hell were they dumping detonators yards from a skate park?’ The damaged fence was fixed within hours of the accident. Railway detonators are yellow disks of metal just over two inches in diameter and less than half an inch deep. Maintenance workers line up three on the track when visibility is poor. They are triggered when a train runs over them, making a loud but harmless bang to warn them of the approaching danger. Transport police said 31 had been recovered. It is not known how many were triggered by the fire. A spokesman said: ‘They are very difficult to set off.  It takes the weight and impact of a train to set them off – but putting them in a bonfire is a different matter. ‘They don’t fragment much. It is possible the boy’s injuries were caused by something such as  splinters that came out of the fire.’ Detective Constable Michael  Bute added: ‘This is a tragic accident which has had very serious  consequences for the youngster involved.’",Teenagers were able to access Network Rail depot where explosive were through broken railing .

"The Premier League TV tender sent out to broadcasters on Friday - which includes some Friday night games - is set to take the cost of a live PL fixture to the stratospheric height of £10million a match from the start of 2016-17. The addition of 14 extra live games per season - stripped from the ‘protected’ Saturday 3pm kick-offs - will bring in another £140m, taking the monies from the Premier League’s domestic contract over three years close to £5billion. The current deal values a PL match at £6.7m. Even with a 50 per cent increase compared to the 72 per cent rise at the last auction, the £10m-per-match figure is easily attainable - especially as arch rivals Sky and BT Sport will both break the bank for the rights to 168 games. Premier League matches could soon be shown on a Friday night . - 168 matches will be available to be shown live from 2016 - 14 more than currently. - Up to 10 of those matches will be shown live on Friday evenings. - The 168 games will be split into seven packages - five of 28 matches and two packages of 14 matches. No single buyer will be allowed to acquire more than five packages or 126 matches. - The ITT will include an auction for a free-to-air highlights package, held by the BBC's Match of the Day since 2004. - The current total value of the domestic broadcast rights deals is £3.018billion over three years. - An announcement on the 2016-19 rights is expected by early March. - A later auction will take place for 212 'near-live' matches to be accessed on-demand, and for internet-based clips. - The ITT will protect the Saturday 3pm 'closed period' where games kicking off then are not shown live. Most of the 14 extra games - though fewer than 10 - will be played on Friday nights. And the matches will be offered for sale in a beefed-up 28-game package with Monday night football. The four other 28-game sets are for Saturday and Sunday TV slots, while there are two 14-game packages consisting of midweek and Bank Holiday fixtures. But even the smaller packages remain way beyond terrestrial TV’s reach. Sky, having seen BT grab their Champions League portfolio, need to win at least four of the five super packages to retain their dominant position. ITV are sure to bid for the highlights contract, even though that format seems to have a much better fit on Match of the Day. As the BBC will prioritise retaining their MotD content, the Premier League can anticipate another huge rise on the current £180m deal. Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and than number could go up with the new deal . BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013 .

Davies, rather than return calls, chose to write a letter to little-known American website LetsRun.com in which he complained about the newspaper reports that a well-known British star was on a list of 150 athletes with suspiciously high blood count levels who were said not to have been target tested. But Davies wrote himself: ‘Athletes with a red flag reading may well be guilty of doping.’ Bassett spat with BT .

"Ally McCoist decided to quit as Rangers manager after becoming increasingly dismayed and disillusioned by events behind the scenes. Friday night’s Championship defeat to Queen of the South was a fitting end to a miserable day for the Ibrox club. And Sportsmail understands McCoist has had enough following job losses to long-serving staff as part of an ongoing, cost-cutting programme . Ally McCoist watched Rangers lose 2-0 at Queen of the South on Friday night . It’s thought Jimmy Sinclair, head of the club’s youth academy at Murray Park, is set to be the next victim of the cull. McCoist has reached the point where he is willing to give up more than £400,000 of the settlement he would be due had he instead been sacked by the Ibrox board. The 52-year-old handed in his notice on Thursday but will serve out that 12-month period unless the directors negotiate a deal over his contract or place him on gardening leave. That has effectively created a stand-off with the board as Rangers are in the grip of a cash crisis — requiring fresh funding in the New Year — and cannot afford to pay up the terms of his rolling contract. Rangers chief executive Charles Green (top row centre) talks to Ally McCoist before the match . By leaving under his own accord, McCoist is understood to be due 12 months’ cash. He took a 50-per-cent pay cut to aid the club earlier this year but his severance is based on his original £800,000 salary. Had he been sacked, however, it is believed he would have been eligible for an 18-month pay-off. The dramatic development over his future emerged just hours before Rangers travelled to Dumfries for last night’s match. McCoist was in the dugout but for how long will be the question after this latest extraordinary twist in the Ibrox saga. He was already under pressure from fans following poor results this season but, as has become the norm at Rangers, finance will dictate what happens next. Last night McCoist repeatedly refused to deny he’d offered his resignation when quizzed about the day’s events after the 2-0 loss. Rangers Manager Ally McCoist (right) was the centre of attention at Queen of the South . Asked if fans deserved clarity, he said: ‘I think they will probably get some clarity. I obviously can’t comment myself. I think the club will probably comment. I would just like to take this opportunity to thank the fans for their support. They certainly didn’t get a performance tonight and I’d like to apologise for that.’ He added: ‘I’m the Rangers boss and I’ll be doing everything to make sure we get back in the fight for promotion. I have absolutely no comment on rumours.’ Pressed on whether the board had approached him upon hearing the reports, he replied: ‘I’ve no comment to make on speculation. ‘We will be back in tomorrow and I will be acting as if nothing has changed. I told them (the players) I was the Rangers manager and I’d continue to be Rangers manager.’ As for the day of fevered analysis, McCoist said: ‘I’m stating the obvious when I say it’s not ideal preparation but, in the grand scheme of things, it’s been an eventful three-and-a-half years, so nothing shocks me any more. Queen of the South's Kevin Holt rifles his free-kick into the net to break the deadlock . ‘I wouldn’t say I’m angered. I was completely focused on the game. It’s my job to manage the team and prepare them — and we did that. ‘But I have to say to the Rangers fans it was absolutely not good enough and there are no excuses. ‘You can’t make any excuses about speculation. It’s not good enough.’ Pressed on reports his players were heading for a Christmas night out tomorrow, McCoist said: ‘I wouldn’t say they are confined to barracks, but they will be in.’ Rangers are thought to be closing in on a new chief executive and finance director but Derek Llambias, former Newcastle managing director and ally of Mike Ashley, is currently playing a significant role in the running of operations. That has involved redundancies to a number of staff in recent times as all aspects of the business are analysed. McCoist is thought to have been considering his own position for weeks after feeling increasingly drained by the situation. And one source said: ‘A lot of good people have been leaving Ibrox recently and now it seems Ally will go. Gavin Reilly fires home to put his side 2-0 up against Rangers . ‘There has been an increasing level of noise around his position and that has deflected attention away from real issues. ‘Maybe he is thinking that by taking a step back, the spotlight will now shine on the club and the people responsible for its future. ‘We all know significant funding is required and the directors will have to provide answers at the AGM. ‘Many people who have Rangers at heart have been dismissed but the pay of a maintenance man or a groundsman can’t come close to the amount of money that has haemorrhaged from this place. ‘McCoist has been dealing with the trauma of good, honest people being sacked as well as keeping the team on track for promotion. ‘I’m sure he is aware his side can be better but it could be said he has done more to keep Rangers together than anyone else. ‘This is not him walking away. The club will always be a part of him. He might be taking a rest after the most physically and emotionally draining period of his life.’ Former team-mate Stuart McCall, a contender to replace McCoist, said last night: ‘When the news broke, I was gutted. For Alistair to chuck it in after what he has been through… he’s not that type. ‘Something has happened and we don’t know what. If Alistair was to leave, the legend that he is, it would be a blow. Everyone talks about dignity, he has been a great figurehead of this club.’","Ally McCoist has had enough following job losses to long-serving staff .

"Dave Whelan’s future as the chairman of Wigan Athletic was shrouded in uncertainty on Friday night after he accepted an FA misconduct charge for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities. Whelan said he would resign if found guilty by the governing body and some form of punishment for his comments is sure to follow after he submitted a detailed response ahead Friday’s deadline. In trying to justify his controversial appointment of Malky Mackay as manager, at a time when Mackay remains the subject of an FA investigation into an exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist messages, Whelan is alleged to have made insulting remarks about the Chinese and Jews in a newspaper interview. Dave Whelan (centre) has accepted an FA misconduct charge after a number of inappropriate comments . The 78-year-old was quoted saying ‘Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else’ while also arguing there was ‘nothing’ offensive about the term ‘chink’. Whelan will now have to appear before an independent FA disciplinary commission, but the fact that he has admitted to the charge would leave him open to accusations of hypocrisy if he does not now stand down as chairman. Last month he said he would resign, with his grandson David Sharpe expected to take over. Whelan said: ‘If the FA look into my affairs — and they were to find me guilty, which I hope they don’t and I don’t see anything like that happening because I’m absolutely anti-racist, always have been, always will be — however, if they have any questions I’m willing to answer it and, should they even suggest I’m guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.’ Whelan came under fire after appointing Malky Mackay (right), despite an FA investigation into the Scot . CLICK HERE to read more on the Cardiff racism storm, revealed by Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton. On Friday night, Whelan was unavailable for comment, while the club’s media officer said Wigan would not be saying anything on the matter. The FA also declined to comment. But the situation only puts Mackay under more pressure after an already difficult start. If he now loses the man who appointed him at a time when he could yet be facing an FA charge, it will only create further difficulties for the former Cardiff manager. Whelan could be hit with a ban as well as a heavy fine. If Mackay, who along with his former Cardiff colleague Iain Moody is still the subject of an FA investigation, is also charged and then banned, it could also cause huge embarrassment to Wigan. Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has already spoken of a ‘racist chairman hiring a racist manager’. The Wigan chairman had until 6pm on Friday, December 12 to respond to his misconduct charge .

"It has not escaped Rory McIlroy’s notice that the last time a golfer won the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award was the year he was born. Just like the 25-year-old Northern Irishman this season, Sir Nick Faldo won four times in 1989. Just like Rory, two of those successes were the Open Championship and the European Tour’s flagship event, the BMW PGA at Wentworth. Faldo’s other two wins however, in the French Open and the British Masters, were events far below the standing of the pair rounding out McIlroy’s illustrious quartet — the US PGA Championship and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. Is this the year, therefore, when the sport’s long wait finally ends? In Glasgow, at the SSE Hydro where the Ryder Cup gala concert was held in September, are we about to see just the third golfer crowned (the other was Welshman Dai Rees in 1957, when he captained Great Britain and Ireland to a rare Ryder Cup success) in the 61st edition of the BBC’s prestigious sports review? Rory McIlroy beams  in the locker room at Royal Liverpool following his triumph in The Open . ‘It would be big for golf, wouldn’t it?’ said McIlroy. ‘Growing up in a sports-mad household, it was certainly a programme I always watched. It was a chance to see some of the greats of British sport being honoured. So I’m really pleased to be part of the conversation. ‘I think when you look at the names of the winners it’s understandable why it has been a while since a golfer has won. We’ve had great footballers like David Beckham and Ryan Giggs, we’ve had the cyclists, the Olympics in 2012 and Andy Murray winning Wimbledon. ‘Having said that, this would be a great time for a golfer to win. If the wider public see a golfer doing his stuff on a programme like this, it might spark a greater interest. ‘Of course, there will always be interest in golf. But it might give it an injection of excitement, like it had in the mid-90s with Faldo and Seve, or when Tiger came along. That would be great from a UK and Irish perspective.’ McIlroy owes much to his dedicated father Gerry, who along with mother Rosie, made many sacrifices . At a time when there has been a significant drop in participation levels and the game is rarely shown on terrestrial television, McIlroy is the sort of poster boy a sport dreams about. His father Gerry worked behind the bar at Holywood Golf Club in Belfast, while his mother Rosie took on menial jobs to give McIlroy his chance. Sport is full of inspirational stories and the fact McIlroy, from these humble circumstances, grew up to become comfortably the best golfer in the world in 2014 is right up there with the best of them. ‘I realise there are a lot of great candidates but if I do win, I’m hoping it will be an inspiration for young kids to pick up a set of clubs and go and play,’ he said. ‘I know all about the numbers playing golf going down and it’s important we attract more young people.’ As ever with McIlroy, the season has been long and eventful. Off the course he broke off his engagement with fiancee Caroline Wozniacki. He has been embroiled in a nasty legal battle with his former management company that will lead to a slew of headlines that will make the front sections of newspapers, as well as the back, when it reaches its bitter conclusion in a Dublin courtroom in February. In past years, such distractions clearly affected his golf but this season he has done an amazing job of putting it all to one side. Caroline Wozniacki and McIlroy ended their engagement in May during a turbulent year for the world No 1 . ‘I guess I’ve just got used to it,’ he said, with a rueful grin. ‘I think over the years I’ve just learned to compartmentalise. In 2013 I didn’t have the best off-season and perhaps didn’t put in the work I should have. ‘But this year I really re-dedicated myself in some ways. I got back to what worked before, and the results came afterwards.’ The high-point, of course, was that four-week stretch from mid-July to mid-August, when he won three tournaments in a row comprising two majors and a WGC. Rickie Fowler might have been exaggerating a bit to call it the finest stretch of golf ever played but it was certainly the finest by any player born in Europe. ‘I might have played better tournaments but I’ve definitely never had a stretch like that before,’ acknowledged McIlroy. ‘Winning The Open obviously meant an awful lot, as it does to any player born in the UK. It’s on the BBC, it’s watched by a lot of people who don’t normally follow golf, and it was noticeable to me how much my recognition levels went up. A jubilant McIlroy celebrates a dominant Ryder Cup win alongside Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter . SPORTS PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR: LIVE on Sunday on BBC 1 from 8pm and BBC Radio 5 Live from 7.30pm. ‘The second one, the Bridgestone, I played really well. The Firestone course is one I love so it was great to win there and get back to world No 1, which was certainly one of my goals. ‘As for the USPGA, that might have been the one I enjoyed the most, for the way it panned out. I’m really proud of the way I played down the stretch to catch Phil Mickelson, Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson, with the light fading and all that. ‘So yeah, it was the time of my professional life so far, and it’s obviously nice when people like Rickie are saying such things. But you can’t afford to dwell too long on what you’ve done in this game. ‘The wins are on the board but I’m already thinking ahead to 2015 and trying to win more tournaments.’ McIlroy catches the Wanamaker Trophy from PGA of America president Ted Bishop after victory at Valhalla . What a year it promises to be. Not only will he get to defend two majors; at the Masters in April he will have his first tilt at becoming just the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam, and all at such a tender age. ‘There’s going to be a bit of hype around that week, isn’t there?’ he said, smiling. ‘That’s fine with me. I’ve reached the stage where I’m happy to embrace it. But do you know what I’m looking forward to the most in the build-up? Just trying to improve certain areas of my game. ‘Yes, I want to win the Masters. But what will help me do that? What’s held me back from winning it before? How can I change the outcome? They’re the things I’m concentrating on. ‘I’m not saying to myself I want to win the Masters because anyone can do that. It’s how you go about it that enables you to achieve such goals.’ McIlroy says interest in golf has wavered since Tiger Woods' decline, but he wishes to improve its popularity . For this festive month, however, the Masters can wait. Time for a bit of relaxation back home in Belfast. Time to keep the gossip photographers busy, no doubt. Time for too many Christmas dinners and one or two Ulster rugby games. The odd trip to Old Trafford, perhaps. And a big night out in Glasgow. ‘I’m looking forward to it,’ he said. ‘It’s been a heck of a year for golf and it could be some night for the game. We’ve got a decent shout for Team of the Year with the Ryder Cup boys, while I think everyone agrees Paul McGinley was a brilliant captain, so he must have a chance for Coach of the Year. ‘And obviously you’ve got me in there as well. Hopefully it’s a night we dominate.’ Mike Dickson (Tennis Correspondent) Given that he does not possess a set of go-faster golf clubs, it has to be McIlroy. Hamilton may be a great driver but he does not compete on even terms with most of his rivals. McIlroy has no false advantages and is up against a much wider global talent pool. VOTE FOR: Rory McIlroy . Phil Duncan (Formula One Writer) Hamilton should have won it in 2008 after clinching the F1 title, but was beaten by Sir Chris Hoy. I fancy Rory will get the better of him this year, too. Hamilton deserves it as a winner of 11 races this year under huge pressure. Damon Hill was the last winner for F1 — 18 years ago. VOTE FOR: Lewis Hamilton . Ian Ladyman (Northern Football Correspondent) McIlroy should get it because he competes on a level playing field with his competitors. Motor racing is a pastime dictated largely by engineering. It’s hard to call it sport when only two or three contestants can possibly win. VOTE FOR: Rory McIlroy . Paul Newman (Cricket Correspondent) It’s got to be McIlroy for me. Hamilton’s achievement is outstanding but the technology is too important in F1 for him to to surpass McIlroy’s majors and Ryder Cup. I hope Gareth Bale makes the podium, too. The way he has settled in Spain is outstanding. VOTE FOR: Rory McIlroy . Sam Peters (Rugby and Cricket Writer) If it’s a choice between McIlroy and Hamilton I’d go for McIlroy every time. Golf is one of the loneliest and most mentally challenging sports around and the young Ulsterman is at the very top of it. A superstar of the modern game.

"A former attorney who represented Salt Lake City and its police department for over 10 years has accepted a plea deal in order to avoid prison after being charged with operating a makeshift drug lab with this two sons. James Wesley Robinson, 51, pleaded guilty Friday to second-degree felony operation of a clandestine lab, second-degree felony drug possession and third-degree felony possession of a firearms by a restricted person. Prosecutors allege Robinson - who was fired from his position in February following his arrest - was making a highly-concentrated marijuana byproduct known as 'dab' or 'shatter' from the basement of his home in Sugar House, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.

"Target is ‘respectfully’ asking its customers to not bring firearms into its stores, even where it is allowed by law. In a statement posted Wednesday on the retailer's corporate blog, interim CEO John Mulligan said that Target wants a ‘safe and inviting’ atmosphere for its shoppers and employees. ‘This is a complicated issue, but it boils down to a simple belief: Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create,’ he said. Target is 'respectfully' asking its customers to not bring firearms into its stores, even where it is allowed by law . In many states, carrying unconcealed guns in public is legal.

Target does not sell guns in its stores or on its website. It made the announcement as it faced pressure about its policy on the ‘open carry’ of firearms in its stores.

It introduced the campaign after gun rights groups carrying loaded rifles frequently gathered in Target stores including Texas, Alabama and North Carolina to demonstrate in support of ‘open carry’ laws. ‘Such positive safety changes made by some of our country's leading retailers are proof of the influence of women and mothers,’ said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. ‘As we look toward election season, we hope our legislators are taking notice that when women and mothers collectively raise our voices - and soon cast our votes, we are determined to leave an impact.’ The Minneapolis company's stock added 36 cents to $58. 73 in Wednesday mid-day trading.

"All week criticism has been raining down on them. From being likened to the Dog and Duck, to being told they are rudderless, to warnings about the manager’s job. Tumbling out of the Champions League at such an early stage causes a maelstrom at Anfield and plenty — from Gary Neville to a raft of former Liverpool players — have had something to say about how poorly Brendan Rodgers and his side have performed this season. So when the topic of criticism is raised with Jordan Henderson, there is a wry smile. Liverpool’s vice-captain has not shut himself away from the disparaging comments but he didn’t need to hear them. That is why he does not shirk the issue as this particular conversation unfolds at Melwood. Jordan Henderson (left) wheels away in celebration with Steven Gerrard after the latter scored a free-kick . Despite Gerrard's goal, Liverpool crashed out of the Champions League, continuing their poor campaign . The Premier League table, showing Manchester United in third and Liverpool ninth . ‘You’ve got to take (the Dog and Duck comment) as a bit tongue in cheek,’ said Henderson, gearing up for Sunday’s trip to Old Trafford. ‘(Neville) has said it as a joke. He doesn’t think either team is playing really well at the minute but that doesn’t bother us. ‘We know we are not playing well. We know we need to be doing better and I’m sure Manchester United feel the same.’ Henderson has developed a strong relationship with Rodgers. The England midfielder refers to his manager as being ‘one of the best in the world’ and has made no secret of how big an influence he had in reviving a Liverpool career that, at one stage, never looked like coming into bloom. It is significant, then, to hear Henderson’s appraisal of Rodgers’ mood and methods following Tuesday’s disappointment against Basle. ‘He’s still confident in the way he wants to play football and is doing everything he can for us to start getting results,’ he said. ‘The outside world might accept that (it’s all down to the manager) but as players we certainly don’t accept it. We’ve got full confidence in the manager.’ Despite their poor form, Henderson is confident Brendan Rodgers (pictured) can guide them to a win . The Liverpool players were in high spirits as they trained ahead of their game against Manchester United . Aware that victory at Old Trafford would dramatically alter the mood around Anfield, Henderson is quick to think back to how it was in March when Liverpool made the short trip down the M62 and terrorised David Moyes’ team. The score that day was 3-0 but it could have been doubled such was Liverpool’s superiority; nine months on, Henderson does not accept United are now the better team, nor does he entertain the idea that Sunday will see Louis van Gaal’s side exact revenge. ‘We’ve got enough quality and character in this group to win on Sunday and the next game as well and then build from that,’ said Henderson, who has put contract talks to the back of his mind until Liverpool’s results improve. Gerrard scored two penalties in Liverpool's comprehensive 3-0 win at their fierce rivals last season . Gerrard has scored more goals as an away player at Old Trafford than anyone else in Premier League history . ‘Although United have been picking up some good results of late and showing some great resilience, I don’t think they’ve played fantastically well. Are they a better team than us? No. I see the quality and character that we’ve got at this club every day in training. ‘But it’s all well and good me sitting here and saying that but it’s up to us to go and do the business. ‘I’m not saying Man U aren’t a good team because they are and they’ve got fantastic players but so have we. So we’ve got to go there and do it. Hopefully we will.’","Liverpool have received heavy criticism over the last week .

"Mind-boggling statistic of the week. Yesterday marked 9,000 days since Liverpool were last crowned champions of England. They have since been dethroned by rivals Manchester United in terms of title victories and — when hostilities are resumed between the two at Old Trafford on Sunday — there will be an edge perhaps unique to the fixture. It may be almost 25 years since Liverpool last won the league but only months since they blew their big chance to put things right. As Liverpool edged ahead of Manchester City towards the end of last season’s Barclays Premier League title race, United supporters found themselves central to their own worst nightmare. Steven Gerrard scored two penalties in Liverpool's comprehensive 3-0 win at their fierce rivals last season . Gerrard has scored more goals as an away player at Old Trafford than anyone else in Premier League history . ‘Choosing between City and Liverpool for the title was like being offered two different types of disease,’ reflected Barney Chilton, editor of the Red News fanzine on Friday. ‘It was surreal but you just had to choose one and ultimately you knew you just had to root for City. The thought of Liverpool winning the league was just unbearable. ‘When they messed it up and City won it, all the United fans I know just felt a huge sense of relief. How ridiculous is that?’ Chilton, of course, knows it is not ridiculous at all. As former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson used to remind us as his final seasons at the club coincided with City’s rise to prominence, United versus Liverpool ‘is our biggest game and always will be’. It was this concept, this fundamental part of the average United supporter’s make-up, that saw them standing in Manchester pubs next to City fans rooting for Chelsea as Steven Gerrard’s slip at Anfield began the unravelling of Liverpool’s challenge last April. Equally, it is this that sees United anticipating Sunday’s game with unexpected zeal. Despite their own modest form, United’s recent results have been good enough under Louis van Gaal to take them in to third place in the league. Liverpool, meanwhile, have the look of a side shorn of confidence and direction. On Friday, Rodgers — just months after almost pulling off one of the most remarkable title wins — found himself answering questions about his own suitability for the job. ‘Listen, command is lonely whenever you are at the top end, the leading edge of the game,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘Football is very short-term. The people criticising me, those same people, maybe six or seven months ago, said I couldn’t do anything wrong. Robin van Persie (centre) scored both goals in United's 2-1 win at Southampton on Monday night . Van Persie (centre) has scored six goals in his last nine league meetings with Liverpool . The Premier League table, showing Manchester United in third and Liverpool ninth . ‘That is the way football works. You have to accept that as a manager and fight even harder.’ Like any great rivalry, fear plays its part. On Sunday, the travelling contingent from Merseyside may fear a backlash from a team embarrassed last April by the ease of Liverpool’s 3-0 win at Old Trafford. At that time, meanwhile, United’s support feared not only that Rodgers’ team would win one title but many more. ‘It was the inevitability of that defeat in April that hurt,’ recalled Chilton. ‘People were coming up to buy the fanzine afterwards and just shrugging their shoulders. They knew we would lose that day. ‘After all those years, it felt almost dirty to be worrying about Liverpool again. Really, you shouldn’t worry so much about another club but this is different. You can’t help it. ‘We had taken so long to overhaul Liverpool’s 18 titles — and then get to 20 — that the thought of them coming back so soon, so unexpectedly, to win one and maybe more was too much.’ Nemanja Vidic (bottom) was sent off for United in this fixture last season for fouling Daniel Sturridge . Louis van Gaal runs the rule over his Manchester United squad in training on Thursday . In Liverpool, the pain of failure — if that’s what it was — was acute last season. That is perhaps nothing, however, compared to the trauma of seeing Rodger’s rebuilt team perform so lamely this time round. Tuesday’s failure to beat Basle and progress into the Champions League knockout stages has only increased scrutiny of the Liverpool manager. Currently, Liverpool are ninth, seven points behind United. Defeat on Sunday would leave Rodgers with a point fewer than Roy Hodgson had at this stage in the 2010-11 season. Hodgson was sacked a month later. On Sunday, the identity of the two managers certainly brings some extra intrigue to proceedings. Liverpool wanted to install Van Gaal as director of football before appointing Rodgers in the summer of 2012 only for the Irishman to object. Meanwhile, Rodgers suggested when United and Liverpool met during pre-season in Miami that Van Gaal may be ‘surprised’ by the Premier League, words that have subsequently sounded a little foolish. Brendan Rodgers was doing the same with his squad on Friday at Liverpool's Melwood training ground . Gerrard on his haunches after Liverpool were knocked out of the Champions League on Tuesday night . At Carrington on Friday, Van Gaal was diplomatic about that. ‘Maybe, he was right,’ said the United manager. ‘The Premier League is not so easy and I knew that in advance. The last matches of Liverpool they were a little bit unlucky. But you have to survive that as a manager.’ Van Gaal knows about big rivalries, having twice worked at Barcelona, and spoke on Friday like a man who believes he will enjoy Sunday’s experience. ‘I managed the team in front of 102,000 at Real Madrid and we won 3-0,’ he smiled. If Liverpool are to get a result tomorrow then captain Gerrard will perhaps need to be fundamental to it. He will, of course, be reminded by United fans of his part in last season’s title denouement. There will be no sympathy. United, including former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes (left) are put through their paces at Carrington . Van Persie (left) and Wayne Rooney will be the main threats for United at Old Trafford on Sunday . ‘Most reds knows that he is their Robbo (Bryan Robson),’ said Chilton. ‘There is probably some respect there. But he has kissed the TV cameras when he has scored at Old Trafford. He has done his bit, too. ‘He fell over last season and Liverpool blew the title. He will be reminded of that. That’s football. To us, last season is like that moment in Dallas when Bobby Ewing appeared out of the shower when people thought he was dead. ‘It’s like a bad dream, as if it never actually happened.’","It has been 9,000 days since Liverpool were crowned champions .
