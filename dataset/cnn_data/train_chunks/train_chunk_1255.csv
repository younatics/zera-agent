"Apology: Daniel Avila made the claims about the devil being responsible for homosexuality in America's oldest Catholic newspaper . The oldest Roman Catholic newspaper in the United States has retracted a column suggesting the devil may be responsible for same-sex attraction. The opinion piece, which appeared on Friday in the Archdiocese of Boston's official newspaper, The Pilot, was titled 'Some fundamental questions on same-sex attraction.' Its author said that 'the scientific evidence of how same-sex attraction most likely may be created provides a credible basis for a spiritual explanation that indicts the devil.' The controversial piece was written . by Daniel Avila, an associate director for policy and research for the . U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. It . also says 'disruptive imbalances in nature that thwart encoded . processes point to supernatural actors who, unlike God, do not have the . good of persons at heart.' The . column goes on to claim that when 'natural causes disturb otherwise . typical biological development, leading to the personally unchosen . beginnings of same-sex attraction, the ultimate responsibility, on a . theological level, is and should be imputed to the evil one, not God.' Controversy: The 182-year-old newspaper had to withdraw the opinion piece after recognising a 'theological error' The . 182-year-old newspaper withdrew the column from its website on . Wednesday, saying it had failed to recognize the 'theological error' before publication. It posted an apology from Avila . saying the column didn't represent the position of the Conference of . Catholic Bishops, whose stated purpose is to 'promote the greater good . which the Church offers humankind,' and wasn't authorized for . publication. Archdiocesan . officials said Avila's apology would appear in the issue of The Pilot . to be published this week, The Boston Globe reported. Avila said same-sex attraction 'should be imputed to the evil one, not God' The Boston archdiocese, the bishops' group and Avila were involved in communications leading to the decision . to retract the column, said archdiocese spokesman Terrence Donilon, who . called Avila 'passionate about his faith and passionate about his . church.' 'This one,' Donilon said, 'clearly just got away from him.' Avila . issued a statement saying: 'The Church opposes, as I do too, all unjust . discrimination and the violence against persons that unjust . discrimination inspires.

"After Joy Self noticed her belly was swelling, doctors told her she had a hernia. But when the 70-year-old finally went under the knife after more than a decade, surgeons removed a beach ball-sized tumour weighing an astonishing 56lb. Ms Self, of Garland, near Dallas, Texas, said it was between 10 and 12 years ago that she first noticed she was putting on weight. Scroll down for video . Size of a beach ball: Joy Self's swollen belly, shown shortly before she had an enormous ovarian tumour cut out . Her stomach grew and grew, yet she did not seek medical help until years later - by which point the bump had inflated to grotesque proportions. 'Three different doctors thought it was a hernia,' she told local broadcaster CBS DFW. And so Ms Self was shocked when staff at Medical City Dallas Hospital revealed that the growth was actually a benign ovarian tumour. Carrying around the weight of about four bowling balls had taken its toll on Ms Self. By the time doctors took action she was suffering severe pain in her back, ribs and stomach and could barely walk, using furniture to steady herself. Dr Thomas Heffernan, one of the surgeons at the hospital, said the tumour was cutting off the patient's circulation, preventing blood from flowing to her legs and back to her heart. Suffered in silence: The 70-year-old patient first noticed her stomach was growing more than a decade ago . Following the complex operation last month, he told CBS: 'It was well off the beaten path. There’s not a paragraph or chapter that tells you quite how to do this one. It had distorted the normal anatomy so much, you had to be careful you didn’t injure something, a loop of bowel for example.' Once removed, the growth was sent to a lab for analysis, where it was found to be made up of thin walls holding a viscous fluid. Dr Heffernan had not seen a tumour of this size for years. He said he had encountered a 100lb growth while he was training, but even this is dwarfed by the world record of 300lb. Ms Self spoke of her relief that her ordeal is over, and said the experience has cured her phobia of doctors. 'I feel wonderful now,' she added. Doctors said she has made a full recovery and did not suffer any lasting effects.","Joy Self, 70, put off seeking help for huge ovarian cyst ."
"Missing toddler Ben Needham may have been buried under rubble at a building site following a tragic accident, Greek police believe. The search for the Sheffield boy, whose disappearance 21 years ago became one of the highest profile missing child cases in recent memory, is to be relaunched as officers seek to dig up a mound near where he was last seen. Authorities on the island of Kos are working alongside British police and have asked them for 3D ground scanning equipment to check for bones beneath the surface. But Ben's mother Kerry Needham, who insists her son is still alive, does not believe he will be found there. Clinging to hope: Ben's mother Kerry, 40, believes police will not find her son under the rubble and insists he is still alive . The 40-year-old, from Ecclesfield, Sheffield, was shocked to hear detectives are planning to excavate the site next to a farmhouse which her father Eddie was renovating at the time. Greek police decided to officially reopen the decades-old cold case after a JCB driver claimed he had been digging just 50 yards away from where the boy was last seen. Ben disappeared on the afternoon of July 24, 1991, after his young mother left him with her parents while she went to work at a hotel. Eddie and Christine Needham took him to a farmhouse belonging to their friend Michaelis Kypreos, where the couple ate lunch as their grandson played outside. But when they realised Ben had fallen silent, they discovered he was nowhere to be seen and called for a police search team. Still seeking answers: A young Kerry Needham on the island of Kos, where her son Ben went missing while in the care of her parents . Nightmare: Grandparents Eddie (left) and Christine (right) were looking after Ben while young mother Kerry (centre) was at work . According to the Daily Mirror, three main theories have emerged: firstly, that Ben wandered away and was caught under rubble as it was unloaded from a truck; that he was killed in an accident and buried in a shallow grave where the building waste would later be dumped; and lastly, that he was murdered and his body was hidden on the site. However, Ms Needham recalls the rubble was already there when she visited the area with Ben and his father, her then boyfriend Simon Ward. She said: 'My dad was renovating the farmhouse. There was some building work going on but it was further down the lane from the farmhouse where Ben was. Mystery: Baby Ben, who was just 21 months old when he vanished in July 1991 . 'The area where they are referring to is to the left of the property. That mound of rubble and waste was already there while Ben was still there. 'So I find it very unlikely to believe that Ben is there unless he buried himself. But we have got to try and turn it into a positive way of thinking and if the Greek want to satisfy that Ben is not up there then fine. Ms Needham, who was just 19 when her son vanished, spoke of her shock upon waking up to the news that investigators were pursuing the new lead. 'It's an awful thought for me and my family to have to deal with,' she said. 'But it is now showing after 20-plus years the Greek police are actually interested in doing something with the case. I believe that has been prompted by South Yorkshire Police involvement and their genuine support for me and my family. 'And if this is what the Greek police want to do then that's fine - and if the British police can assist them then that would be excellent.' Ben's file was re-opened after JCB driver Konstantinos Barkas came forward to reveal he had been digging on the site when the boy went missing. He told the Mirror: 'Yes, I was the man with the JCB that day. Loads of earth was being taken to clear the ground for the new house down the road.' The 61-year-old said he does not believe Ben was abducted. Last year South Yorkshire Police sent Detective Chief Inspector Matt Fenwick to Kos, where he and a colleague were told of the theory that the child's remains would be found on the building site. A Greek source told the Mirror: 'This idea is a lot more plausible than Ben being abducted. A stranger would have needed to be watching the house and then would have snatched him in broad daylight before secreting him off the island by boat or plane.' Never found: Ben, who slipped out of his grandparents' sight at a farmhouse owned by their friend, would be 23 this year . The source added that detectives on the island knew a dumper truck had been driving on the track near the house in the days and weeks following the disappearance. Even still, the boy's mother thinks he was taken and that a white car seen in the area that day could be a vital clue. Ms Needham is holding on to the hope that no remains will be unearthed from beneath the rubble. She said: 'Once it is proved that Ben is not dead, which is what I know and I believe, then maybe the Greek police will continue with their efforts to try and find Ben. They can put their minds at rest and then widen the search. 'I have now got to gather my strength and keep fighting. The one thing I don't want to happen is for the British public to think ""OK then Ben's dead and we no longer have to search for him"". 'I believe Ben is not dead - he is still alive and he is well and he is living out there.'

"Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable elderly and disabled people who need assistance with day-to-day tasks will receive no help towards the cost of their care, it has emerged. A group of charities says at least 340,000 people who need home helps for vital jobs such as dressing, washing and cooking will get no support from the Coalition’s reforms to long-term care. The Care and Support Alliance said that the eligibility criteria for the system are so tight the only ones getting support will be those deemed at risk of ‘abuse or neglect’, or so decrepit that they are just one step away from hospital. Warning: The Care and Support Alliance said that new eligibility criteria means only those deemed at risk of 'abuse or neglect' will receive support . The group, which represents 75 charities such as Age UK and Scope, said the government’s reforms are an improvement on the current system, under which people can lose everything to pay sky-high care bills. But they say the tight eligibility thresholds of the new regime, which begins in 2016, could mean people will be hit with much higher bills than they might be expecting. They will then be forced to decide between shelling out for care, or doing without it entirely. The revelation comes a week after the Coalition was accused of betraying pensioners by a Labour peer in the Lords, because a so-called ‘universal’ deferred payments scheme, designed to prevent people from having to sell their home, will not kick in until a person’s other assets have dwindled down to £23,250. Under the Coalition’s social care plans, people’s care costs will be capped at £72,000 – with the state stepping in to pay the costs after that level has been reached. But the Alliance points out that the state will only start counting how much people are contributing towards their care once their needs are deemed by an official from the local council to be ‘substantial’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) warned . last week that a million elderly are left forgotten and isolated because . friends and relatives fail to visit them. (Woman, right, posed by model) This means their needs are so bad that they cannot carry out the ‘majority of personal care or domestic routines’, or if ‘abuse or neglect has occurred or will occur’. Those whose needs are deemed ‘moderate’ – one level down – will not be able to access the government scheme, even though they may still be so dependent that they are unable to cook for themselves or even go to the toilet. It means that a pensioner could be left with paying thousands of pounds more than the advertised £72,000 level of the cap. Charities are worried that many with so-called ‘moderate’ needs will simply struggle on without home helps – increasing the chance that they deteriorate further and perhaps also end up in hospital. Last night Richard Hawkes, chairman of the Care and Support Alliance, praised the Coalition for reforming England’s broken care system – but said the changes did not go far enough. ‘The Care Bill is the first attempt for generations to radically overhaul the creaking system,’ he said. ‘The Government has put forward bold proposals to bring social care into the 21st Century. It’s a real achievement. ‘But it’s becoming clear that a huge number of people that need support will not see any of the benefits of the new system. 'Plans to tightly restrict who gets council care mean more than a quarter of a million people may have to find their own support without any protection from spiralling costs. ‘Ultimately we want the bill to genuinely promote prevention – rather than crisis care. ‘We want the Government to set the bar for who gets and who doesn’t get council support at a level that includes everyone who needs support to live independently.’ At present, it is up to local councils to decide who should benefit from care, with more than 86 per cent setting the level of ‘substantial’ or the higher ‘criticial’. Mr Hunt will make clear that some families have no option but to put older relatives in residential or nursing care and should not be 'condemned for taking that difficult decision'. Posed by models . Ministers want to end this postcode lottery, and will set the national threshold at ‘substantial’, which charities fear could pressurise councils who currently help those with ‘moderate’ needs to stop doing so. The Care and Support Alliance conducted a new analysis of research conducted by the London School of Economics which found that 340,000 people will receive no support for their care, meaning they will have to pay without their costs being capped. This includes 170,000 pensioners not currently receiving care but whose needs are ‘moderate’, 65,000 pensioners with moderate needs currently in the system, and 105,000 working-age people with disabilities. The CSA admitted that helping these extra people would cost £2.8billion extra, but they said that the costs would be recouped because studies show that helping people to stay in their own home reduced expensive hospital admissions  - making it cheaper in the long run. Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said: 'From 2015, the new national eligibility threshold, together with the £3.8bn of additional funding to support better integration of care, will allow local authorities to maintain access to care and support for those who need it. 'We intend to set the minimum eligibility threshold at a rate equivalent to ‘substantial’, however, this is a minimum level and councils will be able to set a more generous level. This means that local authorities will be able to maintain existing approaches, so that no one has to lose out. 'The vast majority of councils currently set their threshold at ‘substantial’ and the Care Bill means that Councils will not be able to tighten their eligibility criteria beyond this, which sometimes they have done in the past to ease budget pressures. This change will give peace of mind to people. 'People with lower needs will not be left without support - the Care Bill makes clear that people should still expect tailored information and advice to help them find the care they need, as well as support to access services available locally.'","Warning that new criteria will mean thousands miss out on support .

"A 'vulnerable' young girl questioned by police investigating the Rochdale child sex ring has lifted the lid on a second gang operating in the area, it emerged last night. The teenager has told officers she was abused by a different group of men from the nine  jailed last week over the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 13. Her claims have led to the arrest of nine men, aged between 24 and 38, all from Rochdale, on suspicion of sexual activity with a child. The first Oldham scandal: Eight of the nine men who were jailed this week following an investigation into what police say appears to be an entirely separate sex grooming ring. The ninth man cannot be identified for legal reasons . Shockwaves: Police guard Liverpool Crown Court during the trial in which nine men from Rochdale were jailed for grooming underage girls for sex. Just a few days later, officers believe they have arrested members of a second ring . Judge Gerald Clifton: Condemned the first gang jailed last week and suggested they deliberately targeted girls outside their community . Concern: Rochdale's Labour MP Simon Danczuk says he fears last week's conviction was not a one-off case and that sexual exploitation is a wider issue in the Greater Manchester area . Greater Manchester Police said the . latest claims relate to abuse which is alleged to have taken place over a . six-year period, beginning in 2005. The men are thought to be from Asian and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds. They are not believed to know one another or those convicted in the previous case. Police sources have described the girl, who told officers she knew the men by their nicknames only, as ‘extremely vulnerable’. It is understood officers have carried . out sensitive video interviews with the girl, who is believed to be one . of 47 identified by police investigating the original case as a victim . of sexual abuse. Last Wednesday nine Asian men received jail sentences of between four and 19 years . after being convicted of repeatedly abusing five white girls, aged between 13 and 15, in 2008 and 2009. The convictions marked the conclusion . of one of the largest investigations into child sexual exploitation ever . undertaken in Britain. Liverpool Crown Court was told that . the girls would receive food, money and alcohol but were repeatedly . raped and sexually assaulted in return. The men were convicted of conspiracy . to engage in sexual activity with children under the age of 16 and other . sexual offences including rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation. The case has sparked a national debate . over whether religion and culture played a role in the Pakistani and . Afghani men’s targeting of vulnerable white girls. The judge, Gerald Clifton, suggested the men targeted their victims because they were ‘not of your community or religion’. But police and political leaders have . denied the crimes were about race – insisting the men had targeted the . girls simply because they were vulnerable. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman . said of the latest arrests: ‘In total nine men have been arrested aged . between 24 and 38 years old, on suspicion of sexual activity with a . child. ‘They have been bailed pending further inquiries.’ A file of evidence on the latest arrests is expected to be handed over to the Crown Prosecution Service within a few weeks. One senior detective said: ‘Inquiries . are continuing. Just because the trial has finished and nine men have . been convicted does not mean the operation has stopped. 'We are continuing to chip away, gaining the confidence of the girls.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nine men have been arrested in what officers are treating as separate from that of the group of men jailed this week for similar offences .

"Wipe-clean plastic bank notes earmarked to replace paper cash are a 'breeding ground' for superbugs, scientists claim. More durable than the cotton currently used for £5-£50 notes, polymer provides a welcome home for diseases such as E.coli and the MRSA superbug. The findings completely contradict Bank of England claims that hygiene lies at the core of their proposal. A team of scientists claim polymer holds bacteria for 24 hours and is easily rubs off on human hands . In a bombshell study on currency and bacteria, Turkish and Dutch scientists lathered seven currencies with bacteria including the euro, US dollar, Croatian kuna, and Romania's polymer leu. While the euro proved the cleanest - with no sign of passing bacteria - polymer leu notes held traces of MRSA for up to 24 hours, 21 hours longer than any other currency. Dr Habip Gedik, who led the research at the Okmeydani . Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, told the Independent: 'Banknotes containing . plastic substances are more likely to carry and transmit bugs. 'We never become ill just taking bugs from banknotes. But we should take into account that we can be contaminated and we should clean our hands after touching them and other probable contaminated material.' Team member Andreas Voss, of Radbound University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said: 'I was amazed to see that some currencies act like breeding grounds for bacteria while others seem to be auto-sterilised.' Going ahead with a two-month consultation to gauge public opinion, the Bank of England is undeterred by the research. The Bank of England is determined to continue with their two-month roadshow around the UK . A spokesman told MailOnline the Bank is enthusiastic about the project, but refused to comment on Dr Gedik's study. He said: 'Polymer banknotes are cleaner, more secure and durable than paper notes. They are also cheaper and more environmentally friendly. 'They will last longer, if you spill something on it you can wipe it clean, and they fee so much smoother. 'They can even go for a wash cycle if you leave one in your pocket. 'We . still need to see exactly what people think of it, which we will do on . the roadshows. But essentially they are much cleaner.' The Bank of England claims the smaller polymer notes wipe clean and could even survive the washing machine. The new notes last for more than twice as . long, stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are . almost impossible to tear. The move will save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period because of the new banknote’s improved durability. A typical £5 note currently lasts for two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, it was announced yesterday. In a two-month consultation, representatives of the Bank will take model versions to shopping centres around the country to gauge the public's verdict before a final decision is made in December. If they feedback is overwhelmingly negative, they will scrap the plans. If successful, the first £5, featuring Winston Churchill's face, would be rolled out in 2016. The new notes will be slightly smaller than the current note - currently 135mm by 70mm, the new £5 will measure just 125mm by 65mm. But they will continue to maintain ‘tiered-sizing’ – meaning that the higher the denomination, the bigger the note will be. Bank of England chief Mark Carney is enthusiastic about the polymer notes, already used in his native Canada . The . Bank of England has tested the polymer notes in a 90-degree washing . cycle which seemed to have only ‘a minimal effect’, unlike the current . notes which can be ‘substantially degraded’. They then ‘submerged them . in liquids, including red wine,’ and found they could be wiped clean, . unlike a normal note which stains or disintegrates. Polymer . notes are already used in more than 20 countries, including Australia, . New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore and Mauritius as well as in Canada. Question remain unanswered over how cash machines will work with the new cash. But . a spokesman for Link, the company which is behind 66,000 of Britain’s ATMs, said: ‘The ATM industry will work closely with the Bank . to ensure their effective introduction.’ The . public consultation on the introduction of the new notes is due to . finish on 15 November and a final decision will be announced in . December.","Polymer 'more likely to carry and transmit bugs' according to study .

"President Obama suffered a fresh blow with figures revealing that the economy grew by just 1.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2012 . President Obama has suffered a fresh setback as new figures reveal that the economy grew by just 1.3 per cent in the second quarter of the year. The growth rate for the period from April to June has been was lowered from a previous estimate of 1.7 per cent,  the Commerce Department said today. Mr Obama will take some solace from the latest benefit claims statistics which show the number of people who filed first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments fell by 26,000 last week. Overall, however, it is the disappointing growth rate which will be the President's major concern. The severe drought that reduced farm production in the Midwest is thought to account for half the downward revision to the growth rate with the estimate for crop production being slashed by $12 billion. But slower growth in consumer spending and exports has also weakened the overall growth rate. Economists said the Midwest drought would be likely to hold back growth in the July-September quarter. But Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics, said once the drought eases and crop yields rebound to normal levels, the farm sector will provide a boost to economic growth. The new figure shows that growth slowed from 2 percent rate in January-March and isn't expected to exceed that level for the rest of the year. In addition to a fall in the number of first time unemployment insurance claimants, the number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits fell by 4,000 to 3.27 million in the week ended September 15, Labourr Department figures revealed today. A turnaround in claims rates, which have . been on the rise since July, suggests that U.S. businesses may be . growing more confident that sales will pick up. But at the same time, the jobless rate may . be slow to fall after exceeding 8 percent for 43 months without a . pick-up in the pace of hiring. Mr Obama will take some solace from the . latest benefits statistics which show that the number of people who . filed first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments fell by . 26,000 last week . Growth at or below 2 percent is typically . too slow to lower unemployment, which was 8.1 percent in August and . most economists expect it to remain at that level for the . rest of this year. 'The labour market is not getting any . worse,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro . Research LLC. 'But jobless claims only tell you one side of the . equation, so they don’t automatically mean that hiring is going up.' A weak economy and high unemployment could hurt President Barack Obama's re-election chances and bolster Republican nominee Mitt Romney's campaign. High unemployment and sluggish growth prompted the Federal Reserve last week to announce several major steps to boost the economy. Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed . will buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month until there . is 'substantial' improvement in the job market. A . separate report from the Commerce Department today showed demand for . capital goods rose in August while failing to make up for declines in . the previous two months, signaling slowdowns in business investment and . exports threaten to further restrain the U.S. economic recovery. Orders . for non-defence capital equipment excluding airplanes rose 1.1 percent . after decreases of 5.2 percent in July and 2.7 percent in June. Total . orders for durable goods, those meant to last at least three years, . plunged 13 percent, the most since January 2009, paced by a plunge . decline in demand for civilian aircraft.

One architect has shared designs for a futuristic manmade reef with an electric field designed to attract calcium carbonate from the water in a bid to form new reefs quickly. The future of the ocean? One architect has shared designs for a futuristic manmade reef (illustrated) with an electric field designed to attract calcium carbonate from the water in a bid to form new reefs quickly . If built, Margot Krasojevic’s artificial reef could play a role in role in protecting the Indonesian coastline from tsunamis, as well as providing homes for countless marine animals. In her vision, the reef would be formed from a framework of moveable steel girders and steel ball structures, designed in a way to support the growth of natural coral. Large ‘metal balls’ would be connected by cables to floating solar panels on the water’s surface so an electrical current can be generated. If built, Margot Krasojevic's artificial reef (pictured) could play a role in role in protecting the Indonesian coastline from Tsunamis, as well as providing homes for countless marine animals . The current would draw particles of calcium to small pieces of natural coral attached to steel frames below the water, in a bid to stimulate further growth. It would be low enough for divers to swim around the structure - which looks as it if comes from a sci-fi film – but strong enough to create an electric field around the frame. The field would condense dissolved calcium carbonate in the seawater so that it could attach itself to the steel frame in order to build the limestone skeleton. In her vision, the reefs would be formed from a framework of moveable steel girders and steel ball structures, designed in a way to support the growth of natural coral . The 'meta balls (pictured) would be connected by cables to floating solar panels on the water's surface so an electrical current can be provided . And the coral fragments tied to the calcium carbonate-covered frame would help limestone skeleton growth, which is the foundation for natural corals. The reason natural and artificial coral is so important is that it buffers the impact of hurricanes and tsunamis in coastal regions. It does this by slowing down and reducing the force of waves as they approach the shore so that reefs can diminish the distance and amplitude of the waves travelling inland. The electric current generated by the strange structure (pictured) would attract helpful natural particles to small pieces of natural coral attached to steel frames below the water, in a bid to stimulate further growth extra quickly . The healthier and more structurally complex a reef is, the more friction it provides and the better it protects the coastline and damage onshore. The project is also designed to support the growth and protection of coral reefs for their beauty and biodiversity. Corals can be found in both shallow and deep ocean water and the concept would cater to both as it would be anchored into the ocean bed using flexible steel ties, which would allow for it to move slightly with currents. The electric current would be low enough for divers to swim around the structure - which looks as it if comes from a sci-fi film ¿ but strong enough to create an electric field around the frame . The coral fragments tied to the calcium carbonate-covered frame (illustrated) would help limestone skeleton growth which is the foundation for natural corals, which are important is that it buffers the impact of hurricanes and tsunamis in coastal regions . They provide shelter for marine life, are valuable sources of organisms for potential medicines, create sand for beaches and serve as a shock absorber for shorelines. Healthy reefs provide twice as much protection from tsunamis as unhealthy or dead reefs because they have rougher surfaces, which provide friction that slows the waves substantially in comparison with smoother, unhealthy ones. The design of the reef station uses complex geometries like Voronoi patterns – a mathematical way of dividing space into a number of regions that correspond to each other and a set of points in a particular way – to be able to provide enough drag to slow down waves passing over it. The innovative design, planned for the Indian Ocean, would provide shelter for marine life and serve as a shock absorber for Indonesian shorelines in the form of a tsunami . The artificial reef could also include laminated sections of glass that would shatter into small pieces if a large force is exerted. They would be made from holographic yellow filters to focus and disperse sunlight into the shallower waters providing photosynthesis for the corals that help speed up the process of reef building. Rusty cars, tanks and old decommissioned ships are currently used as a starting point for the formation of artificial reefs, but some experts fear that they are just an excuse to dump rubbish in the sea.

"Louise Mensch is sure to attract a new wave of anger from feminists with her new brutally self-depreciating blog. While the former Corby MP constantly stresses her affiliation to the feminist cause, her website called Unfashionista is driven by the want to 'please your man'. Mensch's first post is titled The Holy Grail of Heels, where she praises a pair of shoes that have a high heel and are also comfortable. She continues to describe how, even though heels are uncomfortable, you should 'stuff your ballet flats' because men prefer you in heels. Unfashionista: The home page of Mensch's fashion blog has FEMINIST sprawled across it . She says they are 'the sine qua non of looking hot in a dress' and says 'your man wants to see you swing it'. In the next, What Men Want: Face, Mensch says she got a tweet 'from an irate follower' that said 'Politics to man-pleasing fashion blogging; feminist you are not'. 'Man-pleasing. Wow. What a dreadful thing, eh?' writes Mensch. 'Well, stuff it. As a straight woman I do want to look attractive for my man. He committed to me, and if he likes something I will try to wear it. 'Everybody's tastes differ, but men do like to see a confident, groomed woman who's relaxed in her own skin.'

Mensch has even dedicated a post, called Oh Dear to unflattering photos of herself, and has captioned each one detailing the faults in her looks. She told the Guardian since quitting politics and moving to New York six months ago, she's been 'getting more interested in fashion'. 'I felt I no longer had to wear the straitjacket of the uniform of the professional woman who goes into an office every day. 'I do think it's wrong to focus on women politicians based on style.

"Drinking red wine is good for eyesight and can prevent eye disease in later life, according to a leading surgeon . Forget carrots - drinking red wine is good for eyesight and can prevent eye disease in later life, according to a leading surgeon. Consultant ophthalmologist Milind Pande says the drink is beneficial because of its resveratrol content. The substance is found in the skin of grapes and is believed to help hold back the age-related deterioration of the muscles in the eyes which can lead to vision problems. Resveratrol also halts the growth of blood vessels in the eye – if they continue to grow they can cause macular degeneration - failing eyesight, said Mr Pande, of the Vision Surgery and Research Centre in Hull. For many it means they need glasses as they get older but it is also the leading cause of blindness in the UK and is particularly dangerous for those with diabetes, said Mr Pande. The consultant eye surgeon said: ‘Resveratrol is a plant polyphenol found in red wine and grapes and it is this compound that is helpful in the fight against age-related macular degeneration. ‘It is thought that resveratrol stops out-of-control blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) in the eye. ‘This means it could help to preserve vision in age-related macular degeneration - the leading cause of blindness in the UK - and in cases of diabetic retinopathy, which can cause vision loss in people with diabetes.’ Consultant ophthalmologist Milind Pande, from Vision Surgery, said leafy green vegetables such as kale, broccoli and spinach are also good for eyesight . It is not just wine that can help slow down failing eyesight, however. Foods such as kale, broccoli and spinach contain lutein which has been found to strengthen some of the muscles in the eye. Mr Pande said: ‘A diet, rich in vitamins A, C and E, lutein, zeaxanthin and essential fatty acids may also help protect against eye disease and these can be found in brightly coloured fruit and veg such as corn, orange peppers, tangerines and oranges.’","Consultant ophthalmologist Milind Pande, from Vision Surgery, says the resveratrol in red wine prevents age related deterioration of eye muscles .

"Admission: New immigration boss Sarah Rapson said she may 'never finish the job' of fixing Britain's chaotic visa processing system . The boss of Britain’s new immigration body yesterday said its chaotic visa processing system will never be fixed. Sarah Rapson, who started as director general of UK Visas and Immigration 54 days ago, believes she will 'never finish the job'. She told MPs she could not rule out finding more backlogs of unprocessed cases in the system she had inherited. ‘Are we ever going to say about this . really quite difficult organisation, with a set of complex things it has . to do, ""it is perfect""? I don’t think so,' she told the Home Affairs . Select Committee. 'My . intention is to make some improvements. I would be grateful for the . committee’s advice on where we should prioritise. But will we ever . finish the job? No.' She told the committee the agency was currently processing 190,000 cases. Committee . chairman Keith Vaz replied: ‘You do realise you’re giving us new . figures we didn’t know about. These are astonishing figures.’ Miss Rapson said she would not have taken the job if she was not ‘slightly optimistic’ she could make a difference. But . she added: ‘There are lots of people in the organisation who have got . ideas about how we can make things better. Is it ever going to be fixed? I answered that question from you earlier, I don’t think so.’ The . body was formed earlier this year when the UK Border Agency was split . in two – with Miss Rapson’s department focusing on the visa system and . another authority dealing with immigration law enforcement. Both are directly under ministers’ control. Changes: Miss Rapson took charge of UK Visas and Immigration earlier this year after the UK Border Agency was split in two . Announcing the UKBA’s demise in March this year, Home Secretary Theresa May said she wanted to end its ‘closed, secretive and defensive culture’ after years of failure. It followed a series of damning inspections and reports exposing horrendous backlogs in asylum and immigration cases. Earlier this year, the Home Affairs Select Committee warned it would take the UKBA 24 years to clear a backlog of asylum and immigration cases the size of the population of Iceland. Last year the Government also hived off the UK Border Force, which is responsible for frontline controls at air, sea and rail ports, from the wider UKBA. That followed a scandal over border controls when it emerged thousands of people had been admitted to Britain without having been checked against a watch list. Home Secretary Theresa May said she wanted to end the UKBA's 'closed, secretive and defensive culture' after years of failure . Yesterday, officials downplayed the significance of the 190,000 figure given by Miss Rapson, pointing out it had been supplied to the committee before. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We receive and process thousands of applications every day and so there will always be a large number of cases on our systems. ‘This year we have reduced outstanding applications substantially in the vast majority of routes, improved in-country processing times and maintained out of country service standards.’ Meanwhile, Labour could introduce targets to drive up the number of immigrants entering the UK, it emerged last night. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna suggested the party wanted to see more foreign students coming to Britain. He told the left-leaning IPPR think-tank he was ‘certainly open’ to the idea of a ‘clear numerical target for growth’ in student visas. The comments risk undermining Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has openly criticised the last government’s ‘open doors’ policy. Tory MP Nick De Bois said Labour ‘still don’t get it’, while Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch said Mr Umunna had got his facts ‘completely wrong’.","Stark assessment by Sarah Rapson, new head of UK visa system .

"Cynthia Brimhall and Luann Bambrough (later known as L'Wren Scott) 'instantly bonded' over being misfits in a small town of deeply religious conformists in Roy, Utah . Dressed in skintight jeans and cowboy hats, the two best friends jumped on to the stage in the crowded country and western bar and brought the house down with a rousing version of the 80s classic All Night Long. One, a gorgeous blonde, would go on to pose for Playboy magazine. The other, a striking 6ft 3in brunette, transformed herself from small-town Luann Bambrough into the exotic L’Wren Scott, world famous fashion designer and lover of Mick Jagger. But on that night in 1984 they were both bubbly 20-year-olds, full of the joys of life and anxious to break free from their small-town Mormon roots. While many this week have speculated on the reason L’Wren Scott chose to end her life at her own hand, her best friend from school Cynthia Brimhall - who shared her early anxieties, hopes and dreams - said she believes the truth is simple: ‘She lost touch with herself and she had no foundation or real friends to fall back on. 'The Luann I knew was full of life and passion. She was always laughing and smiling. When you look at pictures of L’Wren she always looks so uptight, like she has the weight of the world on her shoulders. I think Luann created this alter-ego and did amazingly well but deep down she knew it was all an illusion. ‘When we jumped on that stage in the country bar that was the real Luann, a girl who loved life. As L’Wren she had money, fame and a rock star as a boyfriend but she was miserable.’ Cynthia, 49, who now works in a gentleman’s club in Dallas, Texas, said she and Luann ‘instantly bonded’ over being misfits in a small town of deeply religious conformists in Roy, Utah. ‘Her parents Lula and Ivan were devout Mormons and adopted Luann and her brother and sister. I got to know her when we moved into the house behind theirs when I was 16,' she said. ‘Luann and I bonded because we didn’t buy the whole Mormon religion thing. We were considered ""wild"" because we had original thoughts. By today’s standards our rebellion was tame. We never touched drugs, we shared the occasional beer and for all our bravado we were terrified of sex. ‘We made out with two boys in the back of an Audi at a football game once but that was as wild as it got. Luann’s legs were so long they were sticking out the back window and by the time we were done there was three inches of snow on her feet. ‘She was already well over six foot and that was excruciatingly hard for her. She hated standing out that much but there was nothing she could do about it. I was different too, with my dreams of being a glamour model and actress. ‘Luann couldn’t relate to her family. We had to do all the Church things like going to Sunday School and baking cookies but we never bought into it. The other kids conformed. We wanted out. ‘She was adopted which made her insecure. Her exotic looks made her stand out. She’d say to me: ""Where do you think I came from?"" ‘She had a sense of not fitting in, never truly belonging.’ 'As L'Wren she had money, fame and a rock star as a boyfriend but she was miserable' The two girls poured over fashion . magazines like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and talked long into the night . about running away to Hollywood to seek their fame and fortune. She said: ‘Luann . would get depressed over her height and people teasing her and I’d . comfort her and say: ""Don’t worry, those legs will make you a famous . model one day."" They would create their own fashions from second hand . clothes  - ‘Luann was always so talented at making something beautiful . from a thrift store purchase’ - and would hang out with the only two . gay boys in Roy, a town of less than 40,000, 32 miles north of the Utah . capital Salt Lake City. Cynthia recalled: ‘I remember sitting on the . steps of Luann’s house and looking at a magazine and there was Rod . Stewart with Kelly Emberg and she said to me: “How glamorous is that? How great is her life, jetting the world and dating a rock star?"" Back . then if you’d told her she’d end up dating the most famous rock star in . the world she would have thrown that head of curls back and roared with . laughter. ‘We’d sneak off to Salt Lake City and a gay club called The . Sun and groove all night to Shalamar’s Night To Remember and be giddy . with joy.’ At graduation in 1982 the two friends . ordered cheetah-print thongs from a catalogue and wore them under their . yellow graduation gowns. ‘After the ceremony we ripped off our gowns and . went running half-naked down the corridors. That pretty much sealed our . reputation. ‘We never had boyfriends. The local boys were all good . Mormon kids. They stuck to the rules, went to church, wanted to get . married and have babies. Luann and I wanted out.’ 'Luann would get depressed over her height and people teasing her and I'd comfort her and say: ""Don't worry, those legs will make you a famous model one day""' At 18, Cynthia . travelled west to Los Angeles. A chance meeting at a party landed her . some modeling work and she ended up working for several years as a . successful Playboy bunny and centrefold, landed bit-parts in B-movies . and dated Liz Hurley’s ex-lover, billionaire Steve Bing. Cynthia . said: 'Luann followed me to LA and came to stay with me in my tiny . apartment. We had the greatest fun. I remember Bing saying all we girls . needed was a tight pair of jeans and heated rollers. With those two . things we’d get in anywhere.’ While L’Wren’s expensive PR machine . would eventually ‘create’ an official biography - which claimed she was . spotted by photographer Bruce Weber on the street and was whisked off to . Paris as a fashion model at 18 after graduating from school. Cynthia . said the reality was far different: ‘She found it hard to get work as a . model. She was too tall and too exotic looking. She worked in a boutique . at the Beverly Center (an LA shopping mall), as a travel agent and as . an aerobics instructor. 'She couldn’t get work. Then one day she met a . photographer who did some amazing shots of her. ‘She came home so excited and said: ‘""hey want me to change my name to something exotic to match my looks."" ‘When she told me the name I said: ""Lauren, like Ralph Lauren?"" and she said, ""No, L’Wren like an exotic bird."" ‘They tagged on Scott for no other reason except it sounded good.’ The . pair ‘partied together’, dated brothers and enjoyed the LA scene: . ‘L’Wren’s career was taking off and she wanted to go to Paris. Then we . had a silly row and she took off....and I never heard from her again. 'That was how she was. She reinvented herself and never looked back. She . was so desperate to be successful that as soon as she moved on she . forgot about those people she’d left behind.’ Cynthia said another . friend from that time started a successful art gallery on LA’s trendy . Melrose Avenue. ‘She’d know Luann in the early days too. A couple of . years ago L’Wren walked into the gallery and Tawny said: ""My God, it’s . you Luann!"" 'But L’Wren just looked at her coldly, turned on her heel . and walked out. She didn’t want to be reminded of her past.’ 'She was driven to succeed, to put Utah as far behind her as possible. So she kept reinventing and reinventing herself' L’Wren . reinvented herself as a model, then successful designer and, for the . past 13 years, as Mick Jagger’s confidante, lover and muse. Cynthia worked in Las Vegas as a showgirl before moving to Texas to work as an exotic dancer. As . she watched the video of her and Luann - taken in the Cowboy Bar in . Park City, Utah, in 1984 - she feels a mixture of emotions: ‘'For years I . assumed Luann came back from Paris, got married and had kids. 'I think . that’s what would have made her happy. It would have given her the . stability and sense of family and belonging she always craved. 'She was . always a girl who longed to fit in, who wanted to belong and know where . she came from. ‘She was driven to succeed, to put Utah as far behind . her as possible. So she kept reinventing and reinventing herself. 'But . along the way she ""lost"" Luann. The tragedy is the girl I knew loved . life and had big dreams.

One handwritten letter, which was dated earlier this month and addressed 'Dear, Dear XXXXX' and signed 'your K xxxxxx', said: '… It's all right to say that [your husband] did bad things, but you knew that he didn't love you. You know (I hope) that I did. And I did, and do.' The passionate correspondence, using language reminiscent of the movie Brief Encounter, reveals the pair fell deeply in love and formed a strong emotional bond. Although the letters do not disclose a sexual relationship, the affair lasted more than a year and involved the married woman spending at least three nights at the bishop's detached property in Pease Pottage, West Sussex. The Mail on Sunday has also seen a love letter from the bishop to a second woman, whose name we are not publishing for legal reasons. The bishop insisted that the affair with the mother of two was not the reason for his resignation. He said he had quit over a different relationship. Confronted at his home last night, he said: 'This has nothing to do with your enquiries. It is totally unrelated. This relates to a relationship of six years ago. So be careful what you write. This had nothing to do with your earlier questions.' Approached by this newspaper in June, the bishop denied any sexual relationship with the married woman but admitted she had stayed at his house twice, adding: 'She is not the only woman who has stayed here.' Bishop of Arundel admitted that the married 43-year-old had stayed over at his house for at least two nights . The 43-year-old woman was also spotted shopping with him on a Saturday afternoon in Brighton in June and the pair exchanged hundreds of text messages, according to the woman's husband. Bishop Conry admitted he had been seen in public with the mother of two. He said they had been to the British Museum, a Matisse exhibition and the ballet together. The woman's estranged husband, who employed a private detective to track her movements, accused the bishop of 'appalling behaviour', and he is preparing to launch a legal action against the Church. Bishop Conry, seen as a progressive who has been critical of the Vatican's hard-line pronouncements, is close to the head of the Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols. Last night, the bishop, who is sworn to celibacy, said in a statement to be read in churches: 'I am sorry to confess that, going back some years, I have been unfaithful to my promises as a Catholic priest. 'I would like to reassure you that my actions were not illegal and did not involve minors. As a result, however, I have decided to offer my resignation as bishop with immediate effect and will now take some time to consider my future. 'I want to apologise to the individuals hurt by my actions and then to all of those inside and outside the diocese. I am sorry for the shame that I have brought on the diocese and the Church and I ask for your prayers and forgiveness.' Cardinal Nichols said: 'This is a sad and painful moment. All involved in this situation are much in my prayers today.' Bishop Conry and the married woman, whom we are not naming for legal reasons, are understood to have become close after she and her husband joined the bishop in church activities last summer. It is believed their relationship began to flourish only after her marriage hit a crisis last year. Parishioners say she moved out of the marital home at the turn of the year and has subsequently moved into a rented house in West Sussex. Since then she has been a regular visitor to the bishop's residence. Her husband told The Mail on Sunday: 'His behaviour has been appalling. He is someone capable of creating that emotion and distress without taking any interest in the effect on those going through this. 'It smacks of arrogance, and arrogance to the extent that he is prepared to have a married woman sleeping in his house, a woman with two children, and yet he is blind to the emotional effect of this. For me it has been debilitating to the extent that I have felt ill. 'There has been the gradual realisation that I am going to have to deal with this in a mature and sensible way and this has helped me. You have to fight for your children and make sure their future is not in the hands of someone like this.' The man filed for divorce earlier this month. He added: 'The bishop is supposed to set the best example for a lot of people. To think that this is a person who people turn to for marriage advice is unbelievable. It makes him a hypocrite.' Clare Kirby, the lawyer for the estranged husband, said last night: 'My client is considering pursuing a possible High Court action against the Catholic Church because they've known for years that the Bishop has been having affairs and if they'd taken action he almost certainly would not have lost his marriage and his children would not be having to be brought up in a broken family.'

"The American dream represents the idea that all who come to the United States will enjoy freedom and equality. For some Americans and for immigrants traveling here hoping to enjoy the 'pursuit of happiness,' the American Dream couldn't seem more distant from reality. Photographer Nicola Okin Frioli in his photo series 'The Other Side of The American Dream' captures the dark side of immigrants' journeys who are trying to travel to the United States and have had to go through Mexico. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Survivor:  Mariana, 29, from Honduras was assaulted yet able to avoid rape during her crossing as an undocumented person through Mexico, with the intent to arrive in the United States . Dreaming: A drawing done by a 6 year old Honduran girl whose greatest desire is to return home with her grandmother . 'Lorena, Rafaela, I miss you a lot. Back soon ': Gonzalo writes a message for his family in Honduras who hopes that he'll make it to the U.S. The Beast: Armando from El Salvador tried to get on the train 'The Beast' but he fell and the very train amputated his arm . Attempting to survive: Water bottle with loop, owned by Benjamin Chavarrie, 40, which serves to carry water while traveling on the roof of the Beast . Gang assault: Teofilo Santos Rivera, 42 of Panamá was the victim of an attempted mass assault by gang members during the crossing through Mexico and he also suffers from cancer and liver cirrhosis . Frioli photographs people from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua who are escaping their countries ridden with gang violence, economic turmoil, and no social mobility. Many men, women, and children must pass through Mexico to come to the United States and will often be beaten, sexually abused, or lose limbs along the way. Featureshoot.com reports that many immigrants are injured on a cargo train that crosses Mexico called 'The Beast. ‘Some lose limbs and break arms on the journey. Others jump off when they are confronted by immigration police and they become mangled beneath the train. Frioli's photographic subjects are of adults, children, and families set against a black backdrop so that the viewer can clearly see their injuries. Some carry cardboard signs with messages detailing their dream differed. Escaping:  Wendy fled from Honduras with her three children (Jared of 18 months, Jazmin of 3 years, and Eduardo of 8) because of the attempted murder she suffered by her husband . For protection: A Rosary given to Elsa Santos Mateo, 28 of Honduras by her employer in Guatemala to protect her during her journey . Left behind: The hat of Lydia's husband from Honduras who died two years ago from brain trauma during an impact against the train . Crash survivor: Yenifer, 8, of Guatemala suffered, along with her 12-year-old sister and 11 other migrants in an automobile accident in Chiapas . Resourceful: A wheelchair, adapted from a plastic garden seat which is donated by the International Organization  Free Wheelchair Mission  to to the shelter 'Jesus el Buen Pastor' in Tapachula . Still going: 'I'm 21, from Guatemala; while in the U.S. my brother, Danilo, and I were deported, and my brother Medardo was killed. In the end, I lost everything and I keep trying' One of those signs reads, 'Lorena, Rafaela, I miss you a lot. Back soon.' Another photograph shows the scars a woman acquired while escaping a rapist who pushed her into a ravine. One snapshot shows a six-year-olds dream house as she imagines it. The Huffington Post reports that Frioli began his project in 2008 after visiting a Catholic shelter that offers aid and medical care to those migrants injured along the way. His project took years to finish and in 2013 he got financial support for the piece from Apoyo a las Artes/Fundación Bancomer BBVA. 'It's an effort to document the most dramatic side of Central American migration, all the accidents and mutilations,' says Frioli . 'The broken dream of those who cross Mexico with the responsibility of their families and their livelihood, and when not accomplished [face] physical mutilations that could disable them from working the rest of their lives.' Despite facing bitter hardship, Frioli's subjects remain strong and their courage and stance is apparent in the photographs. 'The other side of the dream' does not only refer to the search for the 'American dream,' Frioli explained, . 'But also the failure of an intent to have a better life, the unfulfilled dream and a future that will never come.' Reformed: The message says 'I have worked with drug traffickers (in Honduras) to support my family, until I fled for the safety of my children' Wants a better life: 'My mother was deported and they returned us to Honduras. I am 15 and do not want to suffer anymore. ' Injured: 'I'm 14 years old and I travel with my brother. I want to arrive to the border line. During the trip on top of the (beast) I had a wasp attack.

"The pilots who averted a near-miss crash at Barcelona airport have revealed the shocking moment the air traffic controller ‘went silent’ as another plane taxied in front of them on the runway. Nikolay Limarev, the captain of the UTair Boeing 767, which was carrying 260 passengers, was forced to perform an emergency ‘go-around’ procedure to avoid hitting the Aerolineas Argentinas Airbus A340 at El Prat Airport in Spain. Limarev admitted the incident ‘could have been serious’ if it had not been a clear day. Scroll down for video . Dramatic footage: The video shows the moment a aircraft was forced to abort its landing after another plane taxis across its path at Barcelona airport . He also said the air traffic controller was 'silent' at the key moment, which meant he pulled the plane up without waiting for instructions from the ground.The air traffic controller apologised afterwards for the ‘failure’. The dramatic moment was captured on video and posted on YouTube where it has had more than eight million views in just two days. It shows the Boeing coming in to land on the runway, making its final approach, as the Airbus, getting ready for a flight to Buenos Aires, taxis across its path. The Boeing is forced to abort the landing, with the pilot carrying out an emergency 'go-around' procedure. The jet, which had travelled from Russia, landed safely shortly afterwards. Co-pilot Kirill Kuzmin told how they heard air traffic control instruct the Argentine aircraft to wait for the UTair aircraft to land before crossing the runway - and also heard the crew of the Airbus acknowledge the order, which they then defied. 'Worst experiences ever': The Boeing 767 comes into land at the airport as the Airbus taxis across the runway . 'Go-around': The Boeing pilot is forced to abort the landing, pulling up and going around the other plane . He told The Siberian Times: ‘Before getting close to the runway we heard the air traffic controller's command allowing Argentinians to cross the runway after we had landed. ‘The Argentinians repeated the comment which meant that they heard and accepted it. ‘But then suddenly - and without a clear reason - the Argentinians got onto the runway just as our altitude was going below 100 metres.’ At this point, ‘the air traffic controller clearly got confused. He went silent,’ Kuzmin said. ‘We had nothing else to do than go on a second round. We have worked on this situation many times during training.’ Kuzmin said the air traffic controller ‘apologised’ to the Russian, saying the incident had been a 'failure'. Limarev, the UTair captain who was praised by his airline for his quick-thinking, said: ‘As we were getting ready to land, about 10, 15 seconds prior to reaching the rear end of the runway, we noticed the Argentinian Airbus A340-300 moving at 60 degrees towards the runway we were approaching. Safe landing: The Boeing 767 from Russian airline Utair lands after the near-miss at Barcelona airport . ‘The weather was fine, so after the Argentinian plane reached the runway and got onto it, we went onto a second round, not waiting for the air traffic controller's command. ‘It took us about 15 minutes to complete the second round. When we finished it we approached the airport again and successfully landed at El Prat. ‘As we were taxiing the airport's controller apologised on the radio for the situation.’ UTair - one of Russia's largest airlines, based at Khanty-Mansiysk in Siberia - praised the captain for his 'composure and professional excellence' after 'appropriately' assessing the situation. The airline said that the matter was under investigation. Plane enthusiast Miguel Angel, who filmed the drama, described it as ‘one of the worst experiences I have ever had’. Spanish airport authority AENA announced a request for the country's civil aviation safety commission, CIAIAC, to examine the near miss and its causes. David Guillamon, spokesman for the Spanish air-traffic controller association, Aprocta, said the incident was a ‘serious case, but claimed that despite appearances, there was ‘no danger of a collision’.","Boeing 767 co-pilots revealed Aerolineas Airbus ignored instruction to wait until they had landed to cross runway .

"A would-be terrorist planned to make homemade bombs packed with nails and ball bearings then explode them in mosques, a court heard today. Ian Forman, 41, of Birkenhead, Merseyside, allegedly labelled two Liverpool mosques as 'targets’ before making a string of YouTube posts threatening to ‘blow them up’. He is accused of stock-piling potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal, and drawing up a shopping list of bomb components, as well as creating spreadsheets for the prices of chemicals needed, and where they would be stocked. Lady Justice on top of the Old Bailey: Ian Forman, 41, of Birkenhead, Merseyside, allegedly labelled two Liverpool mosques as 'targets' before making a string of YouTube posts threatening to 'blow them up' Forman appeared at the Old Bailey today to face a single charge of engaging in conduct in the preparation of terrorist acts. Dressed in a grey striped shirt and supported by his wife and brother in the public gallery, he spoke only to confirm his name. Prosecutor Rebecca Mundy said: ‘Mr Forman researched mosques in his local area, researching their locations, and saving photos of them on his computer. ‘He labelled them as “target one” and “target two”.’ His alleged targets were the Wirral Islamic Centre and the Penny Lane Mosque, she said. The court heard Forman also allegedly made and tested improvised explosive devices, and ran tests on ‘black powder’. 'Target': The Penny Lane Mosque in Liverpool, where Forman is accused of planning to explode a bomb . The charge, under terrorist legislation, accuses him of having ‘in your possession potassium nitrate, sulphur, and charcoal; made lists for required components; created spreadsheets reflecting prices and stockists of the chemicals required; made and tested improvised explosive devices; made and tested black powder; researched mosques and Islamic Centres in the local area, saved photographs of them labelling them as “targets”, and expressed your intention of “blowing them up” with the use of “nails and ball bearings”.’ Forman was charged earlier this month and appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 7. Mr Justice Sweeney today rejected an application for bail and remanded Forman in custody until his next court appearance. He will be produced to enter a plea to the charge on January 14. The judge set a provision trial date for March 3 next year. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ian Forman, 41, allegedly planned to attack two mosques in Liverpool .

"Pity the poor deck hands on this monster. Its bow and stern are half a kilometre apart and you could fit four football pitches onto it. Now, the world's largest 'floating facility', which is longer than the height of the Empire State Building, has taken to the water for the first time. South Korean shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries floated the partially built tanker-shaped vessel - named Prelude - at its southern shipyard in Geoje on November 30. The 1,601ft -long (488m) floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) platform cannot be described as a ship because it is unable to move under its own steam and must be towed. Scroll down for video . The liquefied natural gas platform, called Prelude, is the world's largest 'floating facility'. Longer than the height of the Empire State Building, it has taken to the water, off the coast of South Korea, for the first time . At 242ft wide and 360ft high, it is expected to produce 3.6m tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year - and its storage tanks have a capacity equivalent to approximately 175 Olympic swimming pools . But its specifications are impressive, outstripping the 1,453ft (443m)-tall Empire State Building in New York. Once complete, the facility will weigh more than 600,000 tonnes fully loaded, displacing the same amount of water as six of the world's largest aircraft carriers. And at 242ft wide and 360ft high, it is expected to produce 3.6million tonnes of LNG a year - and its storage tanks have a capacity equivalent to approximately 175 Olympic swimming pools. Commissioned by the Dutch energy giant Shell, the vessel is due to be delivered by September 2016. In a press release on its website, Shell said Prelude would operate in a remote basin around 295 miles northeast of Broome, a town in Western Australia, for around 25 years. It is an all-weather facility designed to withstand the most powerful category-five cyclone. Which is just as well as it will be producing enough gas to supply a city the size of Hong Kong. The 1,601ft (488m)-long floating liquefied natural gas platform cannot be described as a ship because it is unable to move under its own steam and must be towed . Shell has shied away from offering estimates of Prelude's likely cost, but analysts say FLNG could end up less expensive. It has put the cost of Prelude at up to £7.7billion ($12.6bn). At 600,000 tonnes with its storage tanks full, Prelude will be vast, but it takes up just a quarter of the space a land-based LNG plant of a similar capacity would occupy because components are stacked on top of each other. LNG plants need access to the ocean anyway so that LNG tankers can load. FLNG eliminates the need for land purchase and reduces environmental objections. With cooling water straight from the ocean and gas piped straight into LNG tankers, there is no need for long seabed pipelines and jetty construction. Shell's earliest FLNG designs were made in the 1990s but ended up shelved because of the economic recession and technical difficulties. The company started looking again at the idea in the early 2000s, but it was the discovery of the Prelude field in 2007 - too small and too remote to develop any other way - that gave the technology its first shot in the real world. A final investment decision was taken to go ahead with the Prelude in 2011. Its keel was laid in May this year and two giant sections of its hull built on opposite sides of the harbour were joined together in the summer at Geoje Island. We're gonna need an even BIGGER boat? As Prelude leaves dry dock for the first time, developer Royal Dutch Shell wants to consolidate its advantage as the first mover in floating liquefied natural gas - an as-yet untried technology for which Prelude will be the flagship. The oil company's technicians are designing something even larger and tougher than Prelude, a vessel that will need to last 25 years moored in the Indian Ocean's 'cyclone alley' off Australia's northwest coast. 'Yes we will move bigger and move into more extreme environments,' said Bruce Steenson, Shell's general manager of integrated gas programmes and innovation. 'We are designing a larger facility. That will be the next car off the rails.' Prelude, which analysts says may cost over £7billion ($12bn) to build, is a potential game changer for the oil and gas industry. If it is an economic success, gas fields worldwide that are too far out to sea and too small to develop any other way could become viable for LNG production. The prototype vessel's most likely first copy model of similar size will now be for the Browse project - another venture for gas off Australia. Escalating costs forced backers to dump their original, land-based LNG plant plans, and in September this year, they decided to go ahead with Shell's FLNG technology instead. 'The Browse structure will be 90 per cent the same as Prelude,' said Steenson - citing the 'design one, build many' mantra Shell hopes will eventually pay off and placate shareholders worried about the firm's total $45billion-a-year capital spending bill. Browse's developer, Woodside Petroleum, said in October it may use as many as three of the FLNG vessels that Shell is developing along with Samsung Heavy and oil and gas engineers Technip. An even bigger FLNG plant than the ones to be built for Prelude and Browse could make life more interesting for the competition. A wide range of land-based 'wannabe' LNG exporters in Canada, Russia and east Africa all hope to tap the burgeoning Asian gas demand in the same way a number of Australian and U.S-based LNG developments will be doing over the coming few years. Anchored about 125 miles off the Australian coast, Prelude will chill the gas to reduce its volume by a factor of 600 and load it on to specialised LNG tankers. Prelude will only produce about 3.6 million tonnes a year (mtpa) of LNG along with its 5.3 mtpa of liquids and other hydrocarbons - a fraction of some land-based LNG plants. Steenson envisages a bigger version could produce far more - giving it economies of scale closer to those to be enjoyed by bigger land-based producing plants such as Gorgon, a 15.6 mtpa plant taking shape on northwest Australia's coast to tap offshore gas. Gorgon, led by Shell's US-based rival Chevron, should be producing in early 2015, well ahead of Prelude, but it is way over budget and now scheduled to cost £31billion ($52bn) against an original £23billion ($37bn). Plans for a land-based Browse plant were cancelled this year as its likely cost reached £27billion ($45bn), and the outlook for global gas demand faltered.

"Hunting for your charger and a free plug socket could soon be a thing of the past. This is according to two electricians, who have designed the world’s first portable turbine phone charger that lets people charge their mobile phone using wind power alone. In fact, the generator can power up any item that requires a USB charger for power. Scroll down for video . Called Trinity, the device doesn’t quite mimic the shape of your usual wind turbine. Instead, the product folds together into a 12-inch (30 cm) cylinder. It then unfolds into a vertical turbine that be used to charge USB devices. Inside the turbine is a battery that holds 15,000 mAh and a 15-watt generator. To open the blades, you first need to pull out the legs and arrange them in a tripod or flat. This will then enable the blades to catch the wind and spin, generating power. Plugging a USB device into the base of the turbine will then charge it. To close it up, the legs are pushed back in and the blades closed automatically. To open the product you pull out the aluminium legs and arrange them either into a tripod or on a flat surface. At the top of the legs is a turbine with three blades. These capture the wind and spin, providing green energy for a generator that can supply to 15 watts of power. There is also an internal battery that can store energy if you don’t need it right away. The inventors claim when fully-charged the turbine can charge your phone four to six times. Once . the turbine is out of juice you can either charge it using the wind or . plug it into a wall output, although obviously for clean energy purposes . the former is preferred. The . company is currently running a Kickstarter project for funding, and . they hope to be able to launch the portable turbine commercially by the . start of next year.

"If you're diligent about sticking to low calorie foods believing it's a healthy option and wondering why you still can't still those stubborn pounds - then here's some news that's not sweet to swallow. By consuming fruity muesli and low-fat yoghurt you may think you are following a diet that will make you trim - but in fact you're consuming more sugar than found in a chocolate bar or fizzy drink. The NHS recommend about 70g of sugar a day for men and 50g for women but many of us our exceeding this. Our high sugar intake contributes to health problems including tooth decay and obesity - with being overweight causing a host of health problems including type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Not such a healthy breakfast: Fruity muesli and orange juice is high in sugar . The British Dietetic Association say sugar is not 'bad' for us to have in our diet, rather it is bad too have too much of it, . They state: 'Sugar, like starch, is a carbohydrate. There are many different types of, and names for sugar. For example, sucrose or 'table sugar' is added to drinks, baked goods and confectionery. 'Fructose is naturally found in fruit and honey and lactose is naturally present in milk. Glucose is also the type of sugar that circulates in the blood, often referred to as 'blood sugar' or 'blood glucose', and provides the body with energy.' Not so sweet side effects: Too much sugar can lead to obesity and tooth decay . They add: 'A moderate amount of sugar . can be eaten as part of a healthy balanced diet. There are many . different types of sugar, and it is the amount and how frequently you . eat sugar that matters. Eating too much of any food (calories) can cause . weight gain. Check labels for sugar contents, watch your portion sizes . and try alternatives where possible' Health coach, Laura Thomas, 27, a . self-confessed . former sugar addict, discovered that a large part of the problem is . people - including dieters - consuming 'hidden' sugars when they believe . they are eating healthily. She told MailOnline: 'Lots of . manufactured 'diet' and 'low fat' products have hidden sugars that . dieters should be aware of. Low calorie yoghurts, salad dressings and . 'healthy cereal' based products are the most common culprits. Tomato . based sauces and soups can also be surprisingly high in sugar. Even . fajita mix packets can pack in more than you’d expect.' Laura found low fat yoghurts in particular were actually a guilty pleasure in her diet and not a healthy dessert. For example, while a strawberry yoghurt may contain little or no fat, it's high in sugar due to flavourings, colourings and natural sugars in fruit should it contain fruit pieces. An Activia Strawberry yoghurt is just 2 per cent fat but has 17g of sugar - a third of a woman's recommended daily sugar intake. Laura, who now mentors people on how to live sugar-free via her blog happysugarhabits.com, said natural or Greek yoghurt is a healthier alternative. She said one way people can try and reduce the amount of sugar in their daily diet is by avoiding sweet foods at breakfast. 'Start the morning off with savoury breakfasts instead of sweet to set the right intention for the day,' she said. Know what you're eating: Check labels for nutritional content and eat fresh where possible . However, for many this will mean ditching the breakfasts we thought were a healthy start to the day. While muesli and a glass of orange juice may seem good for you, it's actually laden with sugar. Laura explains: 'Muesli, especially ones that are labelled 'at least 50 per cent' fruit should be avoided. The fruit is of the dried variety and a very concentrated source of sugar that starts you off first thing with enough sugar for the whole day. 'It would be much better to buy a low fruit muesli or make up a zero sugar version (oats, nuts and seeds) and then add some fresh blueberries instead.' On the subject of orange juice, while it's high in vitamins, it's also high in sugar so Laura recommends getting vitamin C from other food sources. Step away from the cake! Follow Laura's advice for a sugar-free life . She said: 'The fibre is removed from orange juice so you can glug down lots of sugar very quickly and easily. You can get vitamin C from lots of other sources if you’re eating lots of salad and vegetables.' If you do have orange juice, Laura recommends freshly squeezed as a better alternative to a glass from a processed carton. When it comes to snacking on fruit, Laura said this can also be a sugar trap for the unsuspecting dieter due to the fructose content. She said: 'Fruit needs to be moderated in line with your sugar related goals. I have eaten different amounts of fruit throughout my low sugar journey depending on how I’ve felt at the time and the extent of my cravings. 'Of course, people should be getting their five-a-day (preferably seven), but if you can make more of these vegetables instead of fruit, you’re helping your tastebuds become more sensitive to the sweet taste and will start to appreciate fruit as the only sweet you really need. 'For a period of time I did limit fruit and opted for only low fructose fruits (e.g berries, kiwi fruit) and avoided those that were higher in sugar (bananas, mangos, dates).' Laura said she has seen improvements in her sleep, energy and skin - as well as staying slim - thanks to cutting sugar out of her diet. While she realises it can be difficult for people to go 'cold turkey' just reducing the amount of sugar in your diet - if that means being aware of the hidden sugars to could be consuming - can make a big difference to your health. A 150g serving of Onken Fat Free Vanilla yoghurt, left, contains 18.1g of sugar, more than a can of Coca Cola that has 15.9g. Instead have Total 0% fat yoghurt with 4g sugar per 100g . Dorset Cereal Luscious Berries and Cherries Muesli, left, per 45g serving with 125ml semi-skimmed milk has 23.4g sugar - more than a Cadbury's Flake that has 17.7g. Instead go for Muesli without dried fruit and add your own fresh fruit . A bottle of Vitamin Water, left has 7.5g sugar, slightly more than a small Starbucks cappuccino with 7g sugar. Instead, stick to mineral or tap water .","NHS recommend 70g of sugar a day for men and 50g for women .

"The author of a book on the McStays - the family of four who disappeared in 2010 - says drug cartels couldn't possibly be responsible for their deaths after their bodies were recently found in a shallow grave in Mexico. 'Why would they stage their car at the border, cartels don’t do that,' said Rick Baker, author of 'No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family'.

Earlier this year, claims in an explosive, self-published book by an amateur sleuth revealed that Mrs McStay sent abusive emails to her husband in which she vowed: 'I will turn on you'. In ‘No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family’, former radio show host Rick Baker argues that Joseph and Summer’s marriage was ‘doomed from the start’ and that she may have murdered her husband. Baker made the shocking allegations after conducting dozens of interviews over three years with friends and members of the McStay family. Baker became ‘obsessed’ with the case and has turned up hundreds of text messages and emails he claims have led him to believe that the seemingly-loving wife was living a double life. He told MailOnline in January that the emails depict Summer as a ‘sick monster’ who plotted against her husband’s son from a previous marriage because she ‘hated him’. Reached by phone at the time the book was published, Joseph's brother Mike McStay told MailOnline: ‘The family have no comment’. But he has in the past spoken to CNN and condemned Baker's book. Of Baker himself, he said: 'I don't know how he sleeps at night. I suspect he's looking for money. He's a good manipulator and knows how to twist things. He's just trying to sell books.' Mike and Joseph's mother Blake added: 'It was very hard to read all this, very heartbreaking, the accusations. The bottom line for me is this book will bring focus to finding the family.'

"The police officer who shot an unarmed teenager in Ferguson two weeks ago learned his trade on a force that was disbanded over racial tensions, it has emerged. Darren Wilson shot black teenager Michael Brown dead on 9 August, sparking weeks of protests and charges that the town’s police force is racist. Now the Washington Post reports that Wilson’s first job as a police officer was with a nearby force in the city of Jennings that was scrapped over racial tensions following a series of controversial incidents. Inauspicious: Darren Wilson received a special commendation for his services with the Ferguson police in February but had his beginnings in the town of Jennings where the entire police force was dismissed in 2011 . In one, a Jennings officer fired his gun at a mother fleeing in her car with a child in the back seat. In another, an officer beat a woman on her own front porch. The city council concluded that the force had been discredited with the local population and dismissed every officer. An incomplete picture of Texas-born Ferguson officer Darren Wilson has emerged since the shooting, when authorities say the white six-year police veteran killed Michael Brown during a confrontation in the predominantly black city where all but three of the 53 police officers are white. The Brown family’s attorneys have labeled Wilson as a murderer, though the investigation continues and no charges have been filed. The 28-year-old officer has gone underground since the shooting, with relatives refusing to reveal his whereabouts or discuss the shooting or Wilson’s background. But snippets of his life have emerged. Court records show Wilson divorced last November. His parents were married only four years before divorcing in 1989 in Texas. His mother Tonya Durso, also known as Tonya Harris, went on to marry twice more and died at the age of 35 when Wilson was just 16. Online court records show that she pleaded guilty in 2001 to a dozen felony stealing and forgery counts in Missouri’s St. Charles County just west of St. Louis and was sentenced to five years on probation, with the judge suspending a five-year prison sentence. After her death, Wilson was placed under the guardianship of Durso's second husband Tyler Harris until a St. Charles County judge dissolved that in mid-2004. Young life lost: Darren Wilson shot an unarmed Michael Brown, 18, six times, resulting in his death . Witnesses say Brown was walking in the middle of the street with a friend before being stopped by Wilson, who moments later shot the teenager dead, . According to the Washington Post, after completing police academy training, Wilson was employed as a rookie officer in Jennings, a city of 14,000 citizens, 89 per cent of whom were African-American and largely working class. The 45-strong police force had just one or two black officers. City council member Rodney Epps told the Washington Post that 'the straw that broke the camel's back' was an incident in which an officer shot a woman who'd been stopped for a traffic violation. 'She had a child in the back [of the] car and was probably worried about getting locked up. And this officer chased her down Highway 70, past city limits, and took a shot at her. Just ridiculous,' he said. Complaints and lawsuits piled up against the force for using unnecessary force. One woman, Cassandra Fuller, described to the Washington Post an incident in which she'd called police for help after a car smashed into the parked van in front of her home and was thrown to the ground and kicked for making a joke. There were also instances of police corruption and the city council voted six-to-one to close the department and have St Louis County run its policing. Lieutenant Jeff Fuesting was put in charge and spent four months with Wilson during a cross-over period, describing him as 'an average officer.' He said there was a fundamental disconnect between the police force and the community they were supposed to be protecting. Seeking justice: Images of people shot by police officers are displayed by demonstrators protesting the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson . Civil unrest: Since the August 9 shooting there have been mass demonstrations and protests against police brutality . 'Hands up, don't shoot': Protesters peacefully march on the streets of Ferguson two weeks after Michael Brown's death . Pro-cop: Wilson's supporters have become more vocal in recent days, demonstrating on behalf of the officer . New officers were brought in to try and create a credible police department. Wilson didn't face any disciplinary action during his time at Jennings. After being dismissed from that position, Wilson found a new job in another small, largely black Missouri town where the police force is mostly white: Ferguson. A new report from Arch City Defenders, a not-for-profit legal defense organization, shows that 'despite Ferguson’s relative poverty, fines and court fees comprise the second largest source of revenue for the city, a total of $2,635,400.' In other words, a large part of the city's income is derived from fines generated by the police from the citizens for minor infringements. Civil unrest erupted in Ferguson in the wake of the shooting, with constant demonstrations and protests over the more than two weeks since the incident indicating a deep and longstanding issue with the police force. On Saturday, Wilson's supporters staged a public rally in Ferguson where they claimed Michael Brown's death was 'warranted and justified' and promised the cop their 'unwavering support.' Having successfully raised $235,000 online for the controversial officer, The Support Officer Darren Campaign has become far more vocal in recent days, with the outdoor rally attracting a sizeable crowd in the bright afternoon sun. One woman took issue with the pro-Wilson protest 10 miles south of Ferguson. Sondra Fifer, of St. Louis, told the protesters at Barney's Sports Pub in St. Louis: 'I'm not against officers, I'm against police brutality' Two weeks on: Demonstrators in Ferguson gathered in intense heat on Saturday to mark two weeks since a white police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager, while supporters of the officer said in a separate rally miles away the shooting was justified . Members of the St. Louis chapters of the NAACP and the National Urban League march on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson on Saturday, August 23 . Opposing sides: Sondra Fifer (center) confronts demonstrators supporting Ferguson Police officer Darren Wilson during a rally in St. Louis, Missouri August 23 . Addressed by a woman who, in a symbolic gesture of solidarity, declared her name was Darren Wilson, shared her supporters' opinion that the Ferguson officer is the victim in the story. A longtime friend — former high school classmate and hockey buddy Jake Shepard — has recently come to Wilson’s defense, insisting that he would never maliciously take a life. Still, Shepard said, 'I think he’s kind of struggling a little bit, but I think he’s doing OK.' 'He didn’t really want to talk much about it,' Shepard, also 28, said of Brown’s death. 'But I can tell you for sure it was not racially motivated. He’s not the type of person to harbor any hate for anybody. He was always nice, respectable and well-mannered, a gentleman. He doesn’t have anything bad to say about anybody, ever. He’s very genuine.' Similar depictions of Wilson, who has been on paid administrative leave since Brown’s death, have come from his boss, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. During a Ferguson City Council meeting in February, Wilson got special recognition from Jackson for what the chief said then was his role in responding to a report of a suspicious vehicle, then struggling with the driver and detaining him for arrest until help arrived. Jackson said the suspect was preparing a large quantity of marijuana for sale. His proclamation in hand, according a video of the meeting obtained Tuesday by the AP, Wilson returned to his seat with a broad grin. 'He was a gentle, quiet man,' Jackson said last Friday while publicly identifying Wilson, a four-year veteran of the department after spending two policing in nearby Jennings, as the officer who shot Brown, noting that Wilson has no prior disciplinary record. Calling Wilson 'distinguished' and 'a gentleman,' Jackson added that 'he is, he has been, an excellent officer.' Wilson, who has Missouri hunting and fishing licenses, did not answer the AP’s knock Tuesday on his door at his brick, ranch-style home in Missouri’s Crestwood, a largely white St. Louis suburb some 18 miles southwest of Ferguson.","Darren Wilson was a rookie cop in Jennings, Missouri .

"Police in North Carolina have launched a manhunt after a man opened fire in a church playground, hitting four children and leaving a 12-year-old boy seriously injured. The Reverend James Gailliard at Word Tabernacle Church in Rocky Mount said the shooting happened shortly before 6pm Monday, as about two dozen neighborhood teens played basketball on courts behind the sanctuary. Gailliard was in his office when he heard more than 15 gunshots and ran outside. Among those hit was 12-year-old Nyreek Horne, who the preacher said was shot through the head. He cradled the bleeding boy until help arrived. Biting: Colauito Tyson and her 4-year-old granddaughter hold back their emotions at a concert in honor of the shooting's victims on Tuesday . Heartbreaking: Churchgoer Barbara Allen raises her hands in prayer Tuesday, the day after four children were injured- one critically- in a shooting outside Word Tabernacle Church on Monday . 'In our community, we do hear gunshots from time to time. But what was different this time was that it was so close and it was so many,' Gailliard said. 'I held him in my arms until the paramedics got there. He was shot in the eye and the bullet went out the back of his brain. He was struggling to breathe, but he was fighting.' Fear: Residents like Pastor Florence Nicholson are worried about a growing rate of violence in the area . Police said Tuesday that Horne remained in critical condition. Three other young males shot — ages 13, 17 and 19 — were all treated and released. Witnesses could provide only a vague description of the shooter, who ran away and was seen getting into a small, light-colored SUV. Rocky Mount police are asking members of public to come forward with any information that might help lead them to a suspect. It was the latest shooting in a small Southern city dealing with violent crime on a scale typical in more urban areas. The shooting at the church happened days after a funeral for 15-year-old Brian Freeman, who was walking home with a friend when a car pulled up and someone started firing. A city of nearly 60,000 located about . 50 miles east of Raleigh, Rocky Mount sits along Interstate 95 — a . primary north-south corridor for moving drugs and illegal guns between . major East Coast cities. In . 2012, the most recent year for which FBI crime statistics are . available, the murder rate in Rocky Mount was more than twice that of . New York City. The Rocky . Mount police force has a sizable gang awareness and prevention program. The city council has instituted anti-graffiti measures and a local . 'Youth Protection Ordinance' that includes a nightly curfew barring . those under 15 from gathering in public without adult supervision. Using their voices: Charita Grant (left) and Karey Pierre (right) sing through their emotions at a Concert of Prayer . 'We're . experiencing many of the problems many other communities are . experiencing with gang violence, and we are addressing that,' said Cpl. Michael Lewis, a police spokesman. 'There's age groups from middle school on up through high school involved in this type of activity.' Lewis said it is too early in the . investigation to know whether the latest shooting involved a . gang-related dispute, but Gailliard said there is a widespread suspicion . in the community that Monday's mass shooting was in retaliation for the . recent drive-by killing. Those involved are from different neighborhoods engaged in competition for turf, the preacher said. Gailliard . moved south from Philadelphia nine years ago to found the church. Part . of his congregation's ministry involves reaching out to young people who . live near the church.

'Unfortunately, in my time have I have funeralized a lot of young African-American males who died in violent situations,' the preacher said. 'We put the basketball goals up and took the fence down specifically so the community could just walk on the premises and have a safe place to play.

"Signals: The Teachers Foundation of Malaysia, backed by the Malaysian Government, has issued guidance to parents telling them how to detect whether a child is homosexual. It includes children who wear v-neck jumpers, sleeveless t-shirts and tight clothing . They were once considered the height of fashion, worn by the likes of the Prince of Wales and tennis champion Fred Perry as he conquered Wimbledon in the 1930s. More than 80 years after first being sold the V-neck sweater remains as popular with both men and women. But in Malaysia wearing that type of sweater is considered a clear sign that the person could be gay. Government officials in the Far East country have issued a series a pointers to parents that they say are telltale signs of homosexuality. Among them is the wearing of a V-neck sweater as well as a preference for sleeveless T-shirts. Teenagers who wear tight, light-coloured clothes and possess a 'chiseled' physique are also inclined to be gay. The so called tell tale signs were issued Teachers Foundation of Malaysia and backed by the Government. The country's deputy education minister Mohd Puad Zarkashinot said few people in the Muslim country understood or knew the early 'symptoms' of homosexuality, bisexuality and transgender inclinations to prevent its spread. Ten seminars have so far been held in Malaysia where the how-to-spot gay tendencies were delivered to parents. More than 1,500 people turned up to the most recent to hear Zarkashinot say the guidelines were being issued to help children stay away from 'unhealthy activities'. Controversial: Ten seminars have so far been held in Malaysia where the advice on how to spot gay tendencies was delivered to parents. Homosexuality is illegal in the country . Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia and has been described as being against the 'order of nature'.

"Marilyn Monroe became world-famous for her curvy figure, but it may be surprising to know that keeping that alluring hourglass involved a lot of work. Just before she hit it big in 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', Philippe Halsman photographed her for LIFE magazine, taking a few candid shots of her daily workout routine. One picture of Monroe in a hugging white dress made it onto the cover of the April 7, 1952 issue, while the shots of her lifting weights in a terry-cloth bikini were left on the cutting room floor - rarely seen. Scroll down for video . Health conscious: In an early photoshoot, Marilyn Monroe is pictured working out with weights at home . Cover girl: The pictures were taken by photographer Philippe Halsman for LIFE magazine. She made the April 7, 1952 cover . Glimpse: The candid shots of Marilyn working out didn't make it to the magazine, and have rarely been seen . The black-and-white photographs show a very-serious Marilyn performing squats and military presses with a bar, and bench-pressing small weights. She then cracks a smile mid-handstand and gives a come-hither look while relaxing on the floor. At the time of the photoshoot, Marilyn was not yet a household name but even then she was beginning to use her wiles on men. Halsman later wrote about the shoot and talked about being quite enamored with his subject. 'She flirted with all three of us,' Halsman said. 'And such was her talent that each of us felt that if only the other two would leave, something incredible would happen. Her sex-appeal was not a put-on - it was her weapon and her defense.' Come hither: Halsman later wrote about the shoot, saying Marilyn was extremely flirtatious with him and the other men in the room . Gymnast: Marilyn giggles as she tries out a handstand . More than just a sex symbol: Halsman noted seeing several intellectual books scattered across Marilyn's cheap apartment on the outskirts of LA . But her cheap apartment on the outskirts of LA also held clues that she was more than just sex appeal. 'The Talk of Hollywood': The pictures were taken for the April 7, 1952 cover story of LIFE magazine . 'What impressed me in its shabby living room was the obvious striving for self-improvement,' Halsman wrote. 'I saw a photograph of Eleanora Duse and a multitude of books that I did not expect to find there, like the works of Dostoyevsky, of Freud, the History of Fabian Socialism, etc. On the floor were two dumbbells.' Marilyn detailed her health regimen later that year in a September 1952 interview with now-defunct Pageant Magazine. 'Frankly, I’ve never considered my own figure so exceptional. Until quite recently, I seldom gave it any thought at all,' a humble Marilyn said. 'My biggest single concern used to be getting enough to eat. Now I have to worry about eating too much. I never used to bother with exercises.' She went on to explain that she . spent about 10 minutes every morning practicing 'bust-firming' exercises with small weights - but she maintains she's not a . fitness-freak. 'I . don’t count rhythmically like the exercise people on the radio; I . couldn’t stand exercise if I had to feel regimented about it,' she said. Monroe also talks about her diet, which others told her were 'absolutely bizarre'. For breakfast, Monroe drank a glass of warm milk with an egg whipped as well as a multivitamin. 'I doubt if any doctor could recommend a more nourishing breakfast for a working girl in a hurry,' she said.

"It was described as one of the most remarkable views any human could hope to see. Comet ISON, dubbed ‘the comet of the century’, will visit our inner solar system from November to January, with expectations that it could provide spectacular views for the Northern Hemisphere. The eagerly anticipated comet could be 15 times brighter than the moon, with a massive tail, making it visible even in broad daylight. But astronomers due to meet this week to discuss observing plans for Comet ISON may not have much to talk about. Scroll down for video . Comet ISON (centre, with tail) floats against a seemingly infinite backdrop of numerous galaxies and a handful of foreground stars in this April 2013 composite image from the Hubble Telescope . They claim the so-called ‘Comet of the Century’ may be fizzling out. ‘The future of comet ISON does not look bright,’ said astronomer Ignacio Ferrin, with the University of Antioquia in Colombia. Initial data suggested that the comet may prove to be brighter than any . comet of the last century. It may also end up being its one and only . trip to the solar system, as its trajectory may see it plunge into the . sun in a fiery death. In July, the ISON was pictured on the opposite side of the Sun at around 378 million miles away from Earth, travelling at over 50,000 miles per hour . Ferrin's calculations, however, show the comet, which is currently moving toward the sun at 16 miles (26 km) per second, has not brightened since mid-January. That may be because the comet is already out of ice particles in its body, which melt as the comet moves closer to the sun, creating a long, bright tail. Another theory is that the comet is covered in a layer of silicate dust that snuffs out water vapour and other gases that brighten the comet. ‘Comet ISON has been on a standstill for more than 132 days ... a rather puzzling feat,’ Ferrin said in a paper submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and posted online at the archival site arXiv.org. Comet ISON is roughly heading towards the centre of our Solar System. It will pass within one million miles of the Sun's surface on 28th November. At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the Sun . Images of Comet ISON obtained using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at Gemini North on February 4, March 4, April 3, and May 4, 2013 (left to right, respectively) The comet, named ISON after the International Scientific Optical Network that made its discovery, was found in September 2012 by two amateur Russian astronomers. It is due to pass about 724,000 miles (1.2 million km) from the sun on November 28th. If it survives, that is. At that distance, the comet would reach temperatures of about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit (2,700 degrees Celsius) - hot enough to melt lead. It may also be pulled apart by the sun's gravity. Following its discovery, ISON . recalled the excitement of Comet Hale-Bopp, which sailed past the Earth . in 1997, appearing as a static-looking smear in the skies across the . Northern Hemisphere. Scientists . believe the comet hails from the Oort Cloud, a cluster of icy rocks . that circle the sun about 50,000 times farther away than Earth's orbit. Comet Hale-Bopp over Tufa formations in Mono Lake in California. Following its discovery, ISON recalled the excitement of Comet Hale-Bopp, which sailed past the Earth in 1997 . Any object orbiting the Sun in a closed loop is given a figure known as ‘eccentricity’ of between zero and one. If that orbit is in a circular fashion like our own planet’s, its eccentricity will be close to zero. Earth’s eccentricity is around 0.017 which means its orbit is very circular. Comet ISON’s eccentricity is 1.000003457 – just ‘over’ one. This means that its presence in our solar system is an event that has never happened before and may never happen again. If comet ISON survives the encounter, it could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the comet passes back through the inner solar system. Spotted in space: Two astronomers from Russia discovered the icy ball, pictured here dimly lit against background stars . Comet ISON is roughly heading towards the centre of our Solar System. It will pass within 1.2 million miles of the Sun’s surface on 28th November. At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the Sun. Its average speed throughout July will be 55,405mph. It will continue to accelerate steadily until November when it’ll whip around our Sun at an astonishing 425,000mph. Early data analysis suggests Comet ISON’s size to be around three miles in diameter. If . ISON doesn’t fizzle out, you could expect to see the comet with the . unaided eye anywhere between the middle of November until the middle of .

"A grand jury in Ferguson did not reach a decision on Friday over whether they will indict the officer who shot Michael Brown, sources have told CNN. Tension is steadily building in the Missouri city as they wait for the decision concerning Darren Wilson, who shot the 18-year-old dead in August. It had been expected to come on Friday, but law enforcement officials told the station that the group had not come to an agreement and were still in session. Scroll down for video . Tensions: The delay in the grand jury decision over whether to indict Darren Wilson - the officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown dead - came as Ferguson experienced a third night of unrest . Heightened security: There was large police presence in the city as the community prepared for troubles . There was also questions over when they will next reconvene. Overnight authorities arrested three protesters during a third straight night of unrest, while business owners have boarded up their windows in preparation for expected troubles. St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said the grand jury decision will be announced this month. His spokesman, Ed Magee, told reporters at around noon on Friday that the grand jury was still in session. Five hours later, though, Magee declined to say whether the panel was still meeting. He did not respond to messages seeking comment Saturday. St. Louis County police said large groups of protesters blocked traffic three times in the St. Louis suburb Friday night. Officer Darren Wilson (right) - who is allegedly stepping down from the Ferguson police force as a result of the scandal - reportedly told the grand jury that he feared for his life when he confronted Michael Brown . That happened twice near the police station and once on West Florissant Avenue, the site of violent protests soon after Brown's death. A motorist lost control and crashed into a light pole during the unrest on West Florissant. Protesters converged on the car, but no one was hurt. Calls for peace and restraint emanated from several quarters, including President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and civil-rights leaders and business owners. The most emotional appeal came from Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr. 'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' Brown said in the video released by the group STL Forward. 'No matter what the grand jury decides, I don't want my son's death to be in vain. I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone.' Holder issued a general reminder to police to prepare for demonstrations and to 'minimize needless confrontation.' His video message did not explicitly mention Ferguson, but it did reference demonstrations over the past few months that have 'sought to bring attention to real and significant underlying issues involving police practices.' Attoney Gray, the attorney for Brown's family, spoke about preparations being made for the grand jury decision on Friday. They were told that the group were still in session and deliberating . Obama also urged Ferguson to keep the protests peaceful, saying all Americans have the right to peacefully assemble to speak against actions they regard as unjust. But, he said, using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to the rule of law. The president commented in an interview with ABC News scheduled to air Sunday. The network released his comment about Ferguson on Friday night. Eddie Hassaun of the civil rights group Justice Disciples urged protesters not to be confrontational and for police to follow suit. 'We're looking for the action on the other side to be equally as committed to peace in the streets and peace for the demonstrators,' Hassaun said. Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot the black unarmed 18-year-old shortly after noon on August 9 in the center of a street, after some sort of scuffle occurred between them. As Brown's body lay there for hours, an angry crowd gathered. Riots and looting occurred the next night. In the following days, police responded with tear gas and smoke canisters as some protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. Wilson reportedly told the Grand Jury that he feared for his life when he was confronted by Brown.","Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said decision will be revealed this month .

"The two British tourists who died in Amsterdam earlier this week after taking white heroin they allegedly believed was cocaine, have been named. Shaun Brotherston, 20, and Bradley Price, 21, both from Plymouth, Devon, are believed to have died while on holiday in the Netherlands to celebrate Mr Brotherston's 21st birthday. The young men were found dead in an Amsterdam hotel room next to traces of a white powder, local police have confirmed. Tragedy: Bradley Price, 21, pictured left, Shaun Brotherston, 20, from Plymouth, are believed to have died after mistaking white heroin for cocaine on a trip to Amsterdam . Both are believed to be former pupils of Tamarside Community College, now Marine Academy Plymouth, in St Budeaux, northwest Plymouth. Mr Brotherston was a student at The University of St Mark and St John in Plymouth and worked at the Future Inn hotel in the city. Mr Price and Mr Brotherston were best mates in life and death, one of their fathers said today. Mr Price's father Julian said his son was 'one in a million' and he urged the victims' friends to 'learn from this tragic end'. Julian Price wrote on Facebook: 'My heart is broken for you both, always together in life and now sadly in death, look after each other.' Devastating: Keen football player Shaun Brotherston, pictured at Plymouth Argyle footballground, is said to have been in Amsterdam with his friend to celebrate his upcoming 21st birthday . He thanked their friends for their support through a day which has 'arguably been the most difficult time I've ever experienced'. 'I've read every message and comment, it's been heartbreaking but at the same time has humbled me and made me so proud that Brad was loved, admired with so many caring friends. 'He was one in a million, so talented, a master of every aspect of his life and will be so missed by everyone, he had it all. 'I will never forget him or stop loving him, he has left a huge hole in my broken heart. 'Please all of you learn from his tragic end, love each other and make him and Shaun proud, at least they have each other in death as they did in life.' Shaun's mother Karen Brotherston also posted a message on Facebook. She wrote: 'Rest in peace amazing, talented, cocky, funny and beautiful baby, love you always.' Mr Brotherston was a keen football player, described as a 'lovely lad' by his Plymouth Falcons team manager. Falcons manager Alan Potter said: 'Shaun was such a lovely lad, well liked by everyone and a really well respected member of the team. 'He was superb player and quite a few of his friends are on the team - they're absolutely devastated. He was an excellent winger. He will be sadly missed. 'He was out there celebrating his birthday, everyone is deeply shocked.' Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said the bodies of the two men, both from England, were found next to traces of a white powder in a hotel in Amsterdam (file picture) The club's game on Saturday has been postponed and the league is to hold a minute's silence. Friends have been posting tributes to the pair on social media. 'Absolutely devastated will never be able to see two of my best friends again! Never been in this much pain! RIP to my boys Shaun and Brad, gonna miss you boys, it's not gonna be the same without you,' friend Harry Gould wrote. Mark Shellem wrote: 'Absolutely devastating news, way too young. Two young men with absolutely beautiful personalities who will be sorely missed by many people. Rest in peace.' Bethany Jade Jarvis posted: 'RIP to two kind, loving, popular boys. Such a tragic thing to happen.' Steph Williams wrote: 'Two very loved lads who will always be in everyone's hearts. Gone but most certainly never forgotten. Thoughts are with their families.' Bradley Parrish added: 'Still can't believe it, thanks for everything man. One of the funniest and down to earth lads I've ever met. RIP Shaun Brotherston. The Foreign Office is liaising with Dutch authorities and is 'providing consular assistance to the family', a spokesman said . One British visitor has died and 14 other tourists - mainly from the UK – have been taken ill in recent weeks after snorting white heroin which is being sold as cocaine. Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said a post-mortem examination is due to be conducted later this week to confirm the time and cause of their deaths. 'We did a quick test to find out what kind of powder it was. It wasn't cocaine, it was an opiate - in this case, white heroin,' Mr van der Veen said. 'We took the sample to the Dutch forensic institute and they found out that the contents of this material is the same contents as other material that we already seized in other cases where people got sick.' A tourists is interviewed by a local TV station in front of a signs which warns of extremely dangerous cocaine being sold in Amsterdam, Netherlands . He said investigators believe the men were targeted by the same street dealer, or ring of dealers, involved in the death of another Briton last month . Amsterdam police had launched a major public alert targeted at visitors from Britain, many of whom view taking drugs as a big part of the city's attraction, including English-language matrix-style signs reading: 'Extremely dangerous cocaine is sold to tourists.' But after no cases for more than a fortnight, the authorities ended the alert at the weekend – meaning the two Britons found dead in their hotel room on Tuesday after apparently snorting the drug may have been unaware of the warning. Police in the city have now urgently resumed their awareness campaign, putting up posters in hotels and hostels and handing out fliers. Leaflets handed out to visitors since last month at main squares and Amsterdam's Centraal railway station warn: 'The last couple of weeks several tourists were hospitalized with severe health problems after using cocaine bought on the street. 'Research has revealed that the cocaine used was not cocaine but white heroin.' They add that in Amsterdam 'you won't be arrested for taking drugs'. A UN report named Amsterdam and Antwerp as Europe's top cities for cocaine use based on analysis of urine in sewage, the equivalent to 1.5 grams per day per 1,000 people.","British tourists named as Shaun Brotherston, 20, and Bradley Price, 21 .

"Emergency measures will be introduced to prevent the lights going out this winter. Offices and factories will be offered compensation to undergo 1970s-style energy rationing and shut down for up to four hours a day to prevent households being plunged into darkness. In addition, owners of old power stations will be asked to switch them back on to meet the country’s demands. National Grid had not planned to use this option until next winter. But yesterday it revealed a series of fires and setbacks had knocked some of the UK’s biggest generators out of service. Two nuclear power plants are also offline, and are unlikely to be running in time for the start of the colder weather. Fires at coal stations in Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire and Ironbridge, Shropshire, have put the sites out of action, while a gas station in Barking, Essex, has been closed since the summer. Scroll down for video . Fires at coal stations in Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire (above) and Ironbridge, Shropshire, have put the sites out of action, while a gas station in Barking, Essex, has been closed since the summer . Industry regulator Ofgem welcomed the measures. It has already warned that the gap between household demand for energy and the amount our power stations can supply is dangerously low. Under the powers, businesses that sign up will be ‘bribed’ to shut down between 4pm and 8pm on any day between November and February. They will be paid a retainer during the four months, even if they are never called on to close early. If they do shut down, they will be paid above the market rate for electricity they do not use. The second measure, which has never before been used in Britain, would see the resurrection of power stations that have been closed but not yet dismantled. National Grid yesterday contacted the owners of recently closed plants to see if they could be running in time for winter. The majority of these are gas stations, though it is believed some coal or oil plants could also be asked to take part. 1970...The new Prime Minister Edward Heath (left) with Margaret Thatcher, the Secretary for Education & Science, and Quentin Hogg, the Lord Chancellor, in the garden of 10 Downing Street. Before his administration was over, Britain would be members of the Common Market and facing a Three-Day week . Plant owners would be paid the costs of resurrecting their stations – which could run into tens of millions of pounds. Once running, they would be required to be available between 6am and 8pm between November and February. They will also be paid more than the market rate for their electricity by National Grid, which said yesterday that both measures would be used only as a ‘last resort’. Britain under Edward Heath was a very different place to the Britain of today. On January 1, 1974, due to industrial action by coal miners and the 1973 oil crisis, Mr Heath introduced the Three-Day Week whereby commercial users of electricity were limited to three specified consecutive days' consumption each week. Services deemed essential (e.g. hospitals, supermarkets and newspapers) were exempt. Homeowners faced a three-hour on, three-hour off electricity supply and television stations (BBC 1, BBC 2 and the various ITV regions) went off air at 10.30pm to conserve electricity. During the Three-Day Week, Mr Heath called a General Election running under the slogan ‘Who Governs Britain?’. It turned out not to be him and Labour’s Harold Wilson was returned to Number 10. The normal working week was restored on 8 March, but other restrictions on the use of electricity remained in force. National Grid, which has a budget of £800million to control supply and demand within the power network, added that the measures would add only £1 to household bills. Energy analyst Angelos Anastasiou, of Whitman Howard bank, said the measures were ‘unprecedented’. He added: ‘It would cost quite a bit. You would need to get a lot of staff back on site, and would need out carry out trials before you can get it up and running. It could run into tens of millions, depending how many stations you needed to bring back.’ With Britain’s economy on the mend, demand for energy is set to increase as manufacturing grows and businesses expand. Factory output has risen steadily in the past year, and manufacturing growth in 2014 is expected to be the fastest since 2010. Analyst Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital said the past three winters had seen almost all of the UK’s power stations running smoothly, which had lulled regulators and ministers into a false sense of security. He added: ‘The Government has been crossing its fingers and hoping that it’s all fine. It’s blindingly obvious that if you have a tight market then you will be more vulnerable to shocks.’ An Ofgem spokesman said: ‘We are confident that National Grid has the right levers to keep the lights on. ‘However, no electricity system anywhere in the world can give a 100 per cent guarantee that the lights will stay on.’ ‘It would cost quite a bit.'","Businesses will be offered compensation to shut down for four hours a day .

"Outspoken: Rail minister Simon Burns said opponents of NS2 would come to realise it was in the national interest . Opponents of the controversial £42billion high speed rail line have been likened by a minister to anti-progress campaigners who did not want motorways built in the 1950s and 1960s. Transport minister Simon Burns risked escalating the row over the HS2 project, which the government claims will cut travel times from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. The intervention came as the Court of Appeal rejected the latest legal challenge to the plan from 15 councils and campaign groups. The project ran into trouble when the government admitted recently that the bill had soared by £10billion to £42.6billion. However Lord Mitchell is just the latest senior Labour figure to signal a collapse in support for the project. Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, ex-chancellor and former transport secretary Alistair Darling, and ITV chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman have all cast doubt on the scheme in recent weeks. But yesterday David Cameron reiterated HS2's importance, saying it was essential if Britain was to be a winner in the global race. Today judges at the Court of Appeal dismissed all grounds of challenge but gave the go-ahead for a final appeal to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. Opponents had asked the appeal judges to order further assessment of the scheme as a whole. High Speed Rail minister Simon Burns said: ‘By dismissing all seven grounds of appeal and declining to refer the case to Europe, this is the second time in four months a court has rejected attempts to derail HS2. ""Parliament is the right place to debate the merits of HS2, not the law courts, and we will introduce the hybrid bill for Phase One before the year is out. ‘I urge opponents not to waste any more taxpayers' money on expensive litigation and instead work with us on making HS2 the very best it can be.’ Campaign: Opponents of HS2 warn the costs of the project will spiral out of control and cause irreparable damage to the countryside . Speed: The government argues that travel times will be cut by the new line, boosting economies in the Midlands and the north . But in a provocative move, he claimed those against the project now would eventually see the error of their ways. He told Sky News: ‘There [is] going to be some damage to the environment because that’s inevitable, but we have to be careful because people were against High Speed Rail 1 in Kent and now they have come to appreciate the benefits it brings to the local community and to improving travel. ‘They were against motorways being built in the late 1950s, early ‘60s. And what we should be doing is working together to minimise and solve the problems while we go ahead with the scheme that is clearly in the national interest. ‘We continue to move forward with the crucial business of getting the scheme ready for construction in 2017 and delivering enormous benefits for the country.’ Progress: Opponents of high speed rail were likened to those people who did not support the building of motorways, like the M1 which opened in 1959 . The objectors say the project will cause an unacceptable level of environmental damage, loss of homes and disruption to many communities - without the public having had a fair hearing and a chance to suggest reasonable, cheaper alternatives. Halt: Labour's Lord Mandelson now says his party was wrong to offer fulsome backing to the high speed rail project linking London and the north . David Elvin QC, appearing for HS2 Action Alliance (HS2AA), told the appeal court the project had already blighted a swathe of properties along the route. He argued that it had been given the go-ahead in breach of EU rules requiring a strategic environmental assessment (SEA). It was being seen as the country's largest infrastructure project for a generation and the largest single rail project since the 19th century. But the decision in principle to proceed, taken by the Transport Secretary in January last year, breached a European Directive requiring an SEA. He asked three judges - Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Sullivan - to overturn a High Court ruling in March. With the estimated cost of the line rising to £42.6billion, Lord Mandelson said earlier this that those who previously backed the plan ‘should not offer it an open cheque and should, instead, insist on keeping their options open.’ Labour’s plans were based on an estimated cost of £30billion and the central assumption that construction would spread growth across the country. This was ‘neither quantified nor proved’, said the peer. ‘I once supported High Speed 2. There are no simple options when it comes to transport – but I now fear HS2 could be an expensive mistake,’ he wrote in a national newspaper.","Rail minister Simon Burns says campaigners will eventually see benefits .

"The 71-year-old wife of an Ohio judge has been arrested and is facing attempted murder charges after poisoning her spouse with antifreeze. Carla Hague, who has been married to Ashtabula County Common Pleas Juvenile-Probate Judge Charles Hague for 45 years, was officially charged Monday with felonious assault, three months after the judge was hospitalized. Her arrest came one day after her birthday. On September 15, Charles Hague was rushed to the Cleveland Clinic after he turned gravely ill. Carla Hague was arrested on Monday Dec. 2, one day after her 71st birthday, following an alleged plot to kill her husband with antifreeze at their home in Ohio . Ashtabula County Judge Charles Hague was rushed to hospital on September 15, with tests showing he had high levels of the primary ingredient in antifreeze in his system . Blood tests revealed he had high levels of ethylene glycol in his system, which is the primary compound in antifreeze, a chemical added to a car radiator to stop it from turning to ice. Judge Hague was been on medical leave since. Family members filed a complaint with the Ashtabula County Sheriff's Department a few days later. Carla Hague, a retired nurse, is now facing attempted murder, according to Sheriff William R. Johnson. She is being held in jail in nearby Lake County. With details scant, Sheriff Johnson said the investigation is not over. 'Certainly we knew from the very beginning it's was a high-profile case because it's a sitting judge,' he said. Ashtabula is a remote town in Ohio with a population of less than 18,000 people . 'When we do investigation, it makes no difference. We do it the same way.' A court has not yet been set and Hague has not listed an attorney. Dodie Mattson, who campaigned for Charles Hague when he ran for election, said she was shocked by the allegations. 'They're wonderful people,' she told the Ashtabula Star Beacon. 'I can't believe it.' The poisoning allegations came two and a half weeks after a Cleveland woman was sentenced to life in prison for killing her fiance by putting Antifreeze in his iced tea. Ashtabula County, with about 20,000 people, is located along the Interstate 90 corridor between Cleveland and Erie, Pa.

"The good old days: A model poses with an older version of the electric kettle at the Ideal Home Exhibition . Fancy a cuppa? You might well be advised to put in some earplugs first. Some electric kettles make so much noise when boiling water that they are as loud as power tools, a study has found. Independent tests on electric models available on the High Street found others louder than a vacuum cleaner and another on par with a  lawnmower. One kettle – the Nuo Findon – put through its paces by consumer watchdogs Which? hit 95 decibels –  the same level as a drill. Many customers find the noise a problem, saying they could not hear the radio or other people talking above the din. Which? found the noise of kettles tested ranged from 79 to 95 decibels (dB), which compared to 90dB for a lawnmower and 83dB for a vacuum cleaner. A normal conversation is around 60dB, meaning a loud kettle can drown out the radio. Which? said: ‘Unbelievably, some kettles are as loud as an electric drill. No wonder noisy boiling is one of the biggest bugbears. ‘Fortunately, there are much  quieter kettles out there. A noisy kettle can be a real irritation while you’re waiting to brew a cuppa, which is why our reviews include noise ratings. ‘We measure noise levels while a kettle boils and ask a listening panel to rate how intrusive the noise is. ‘Some, such as an Nuo Findon GCRO44, can be as loud as 95dB when boiling, while a drill reaches a similar level.’ Which? said the quietest models included the Phillips HD4671, Bosch TWK86104GB and Breville VKJ366. Its laboratory tests examined the decibel levels, boiling time and overall performance of each device. Earsplitting noise: how the loudest and the quietest kettles compare in decibels and prices . A Which? member who bought a Kenwood model said: ‘This kettle is deafeningly noisy almost from the moment it is switched on, meaning, for instance, that you cannot listen to the radio while it is running.’ This month, a report found that three-quarters of households waste a total of £68million a year in power and water by overfilling their kettles and boiling too much liquid.

"Three times a week, Hu Songwen sits on a small toilet in his home in a rural east China town and fires up his homemade dialysis machine. Hu, who suffers from kidney disease, made it from kitchen utensils and old medical instruments after he could no long afford hospital fees. He was a college student when he was . diagnosed in 1993 with kidney disease, which means waste  products cannot be removed from his blood. He underwent dialysis treatment in hospital but ran out of savings after six years. His solution was to create his own machine to slash his costs. Hu Songwen uses his dialysis machine three times a week. He says it has kept him alive for 13 years . 'The cost for each home treatment is only 60 yuan (£6), which is 12 per cent of the hospital charge for dialysis,' Hu said. He said he was not deterred despite the fact two of his friends had died after building and using similar machines. The machine works like an external . kidney. It is made up of two compartments that are connected by a . membrane (a film-like structure that allows only some particles to pass . through it). Blood is pumped through one half of the machine, while the . dialysis fluid is pumped through the other half. Hu makes the dialysis fluid by mixing . potassium chloride, sodium chloride and sodium hydrogen carbonate . (bicarbonate) into purified water. For the treatment, he inserts two tubes into his arm, . which are connected to his dialysis machine. The blood is pumped out of his arm . through one of the tubes, is filtered and then returned to his body via . the other tube. Hu bought disused medical equipment, such as a blood pump and plastic tubing . Hu prepares his machine. He says his nearest public hospital is too crowded and too far away . Hu's kidney disease means he has . dangerously high levels of the minerals potassium and sodium in his blood. So he created a dialysis solution that has similar levels of potassium and sodium to healthy human blood. When . the blood and dialysis fluid go through the machine, these excess . minerals are encouraged to go from his blood and through the membrane to . the fluid. This removes the waste products from his blood - and the . fluid is later thrown away. This . spontaneous movement of particles from a high to a low concentration through a membrane is known as diffusion. The 'clean' blood is then pumped back into his body. Bottles of homemade dialysis fluid, a pan for mixing and scales that Hu uses for his rough and ready treatment . Hu's condition also means he has high levels of acid in his bodily fluids. This can be dealt with by putting bicarbonate . back into his body. In this case, particles from the fluid pass the . other way through the membrane from the fluid into the blood, ready to . go back into his body. Doctors warn that Hu runs the risk of . serious infection as well as long-term complications by not using . sterile water to make the fluid. But Hu, who lives with his 81-year-old mother in Qutang township of Jiangsu Province, says he has limited options. Hu was offered medical aid by the Government when his story sparked national interest thanks to report in the Southern Weekly. The . funds would would bring the cost of hospital treatment down to the same . level as his home treatment. However, Hu said he was reluctant to . switch as the nearest hospital is far away and very crowded. Although a Communist country, China does not have a cradle-to-grave free-at-the-point of use healthcare system. Instead around half of the population buy basic medical insurance which covers for half the costs of their healthcare. The remainder is paid . either by patients or their health insurer. However, this leaves the poorest in China struggling to meet medical bills for serious conditions.

"British Olympic chiefs including Lord Coe looked on in Greece today as the Olympic Flame was blown out - seconds after being lit in ancient Olympia. The traditional ceremony took place under baking sun and tight security in front of the ruins of the Temple of Hera in Greece, birthplace of the Ancient Games. London 2012 chairman Lord Coe was joined by IOC president Jacques Rogge and other Olympics officials as performers completed the elaborate torch-lighting routine prior to the Olympic Flame's journey around Greece.

Write caption hereSebastian Coe, chairman of the . London 2012 Olympics organising committee, speaks during the torch . lighting ceremony . The performance in ancient Olympia was the pre-cursor to the torch's journey around the Greek mainland and islands, after which it will be handed to the UK for a 70-day relay around Britain. Dressed in robes, actress Ino Menegaki played the key role of the high priestess who lights the flame from the rays of the sun. She lifted a blazing torch from a parabolic mirror so it is lit as if beamed by the sun's rays from the Greek god of the sun to guarantee the purity of the flame, according to tradition. This is the only way the Olympic flame can be lit, again as stated by ancient rituals. But then came the mishap as the symbolic flame flickered out - extinguished by a gust of wind. Looking awkward, the priestess then quietly slipped behind a hill to relight it. With the ceremonial occasion under way, the Olympic Anthem was played and the Olympic Flag was hoisted. God Save The Queen was also played as the Union Flag was raised. Ceremonial: Female performers completed the ancient Olympian routine without a hitch in front of impressed Games officials today . The journey begins: Alexander Loukos, a British boxer of Greek descent, runs with the Olympic flame during the Olympic torch relay . An extract of the poem The Light Of Olympia was recited. Spyros Zannias, chairman of the Olympic Torch Relay Commission, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge, Hellenic Olympic Committee president Spyros Capralos, and London 2012 chairman Lord Coe said a few words before the lighting began. A 15-strong delegation from London 2012, led by Lord Coe, was invited to witness the lighting first-hand at the Temple of Hera, as the remaining guests stayed seated in the ancient stadium.

"A friend of Michael Brown, who was with the teen when he was shot dead by police on Saturday, said he watched as the 18-year-old held up his empty hands to a cop and begged him not to shoot because he was unarmed. Dorian Johnson, 22, was walking with his friend 'Big Mike' on Saturday evening, when he said the pair were stopped by an officer in a squad car in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Mr Johnson said that he and Brown were walking home from a store when the cop told them to get out of the street and 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk'. Scroll down for video . Dorian Johnson (pictured left) with his attorney Freeman Bosley (right) said that police shot his friend Michael Brown who was unarmed and raised his arms. Mr Bosley said he offered police a chance to interview his client but they refused . Johnson said they kept walking after explaining to the officer they were almost home. The officer then pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson said. The friend said the officer threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Brown. It was then that the officer grabbed his friend by the neck. He told MSNBC today: 'The time frame was 60 seconds or less, it got out of hand really quickly.' Michael Brown poses with a young relative for a picture in January 2013. He was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri . Johnson said that the officer had drawn his gun by this time and threatened to shoot Michael. 'I seen the fire come out of the barrel,' he told the network. 'I could see so vividly what was going on because I was so close.' Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away but he could already see that the teenager had blood coming down his shirt where he had been shot. The 22-year-old ducked behind a car but Brown kept running. 'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Johnson said. The 22-year-old said: '[Brown] stopped, turned with his hands up and said ''I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!'' 'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.' The eye-witness said despite the teenager's protests, the officer shot again, hitting Brown and leaving him on the ground. Mr Johnson told the TV station on Tuesday that he ran in terror to his apartment and vomited, before checking he had not been shot. He came out from his apartment to see his friend lying dead in the middle of the street. 'We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,' Johnson added. 'We had no weapons on us at all.' The 22-year-old spoke to MSNBC on Tuesday alongside his attorney, and former St Louis' mayor, Freeman Bosley Jr. The lawyer said that he has offered police the opportunity to interview his client about Saturday's tragic events but they have declined to take it. Mr Bosley said: 'They didn't even want to talk to him. They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.' Police have offered a different version of events of the altercation which led to the fatal shooting on Saturday. Authorities said that while the officer was exiting his car, he was physically assaulted by Brown and there was a struggle over the cop's weapon. Police do not dispute that the officer shot the subject multiple times and that the deceased was not armed. The body of Michael Brown lies in a Ferguson street on Saturday. The unarmed teenager's death, at the hands of a police officer, has sparked riots in the quiet suburban neighborhood . Ferguson police said on Tuesday that they would not be releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting because of death threats on social media. Brown's shooting has sparked riots in the streets of suburban Ferguson, Missouri, where 70 per cent of the population is African-American but in a 53-strong police force there are only three black officers. Riot police deployed tear gas and bean-bag rounds on Monday night to disperse an agitated crowd. Mr Johnson said that he was still in shock over his friend's death and how quickly the situation escalated. He described the 18-year-old, who was due to start technical college on Monday, as 'a quiet, kind and gentle' person. Riot police fired tear gas and bean-bag rounds at demonstrators in Ferguson on Monday on the second night of protests over the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown .","Police have refused to interview eye-witness Dorian Johnson, his lawyer said on Tuesday .

"Space might seem like a vast, empty expanse, but in reality the area surrounding Earth has become congested with junk. This junk – which can include anything from old rockets, abandoned satellites to missile shrapnel - will soon make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has now teamed up with Nitto Seimo, a company that manufactures fishing equipment, to build a ‘magnetic net’ that can fish out space debris. It is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph . The first test of this equipment is scheduled for late February when a Japanese rocket will be launched to deploy a satellite made by researchers at Kagawa University. Once the satellite is in orbit, it will release a 300 metre-long wire net that will then generate a magnetic field strong enough to attract some of the debris in orbit. Both the net and its contents will burn up as they enter Earth's atmosphere. Based on a data archive, each miniature sphere in this image represents an existing object orbiting in space. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track . Since . the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, . mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of . debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in . orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and . countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying . spaceships and valuable satellites. It . is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk . floating in Earth's orbit, traveling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph. One major source of debris in the past . was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. Accidental . events have also contributed to the problem. In February 2007 for . instance, a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South . Australia. The possibility of a satellite crashing into a hunk of space debris has worried scientists for years. One collision could send thousands of pieces of debris spinning out, potentially destroying other satellites. There are around 22,000 objects in . orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and . countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying . spaceships and valuable satellites. Television signals, weather forecasts, global-positioning navigation and international phone connections are just some of the services at risk. A recent Nasa report said that the amount of space junk orbiting earth had reached a 'tipping point'. In 2009 there was a major crash between a U.S. communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia. The collision at speeds of at least 15,000mph created a cloud of 1,500 pieces of space junk that the International Space Station then had to manoeuvre to avoid. A Chinese missile test in 2007 left 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. These two events encouraged the U.S to support the United Nations when it issued guidelines that urge companies and countries to stop cluttering Earth's orbit.","Next month,  Japanese rocket will be launched with a 300 metre-long net .

"The little girl had probably only been in the village pub’s toilet for a few minutes. So when she emerged to find her mother and father and others in their party had vanished from the bar and outside she was naturally a little bemused. 'Where are my parents?' the eight-year-old asked staff at The Plough. Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him . They were clearly nowhere to be seen and had obviously left without her. But thankfully the landlord was well . aware where these particular parents might be… because they were David . and Samantha Cameron. Publican Stephen Hollings yesterday . recounted details of Nancy Cameron’s unfortunate adventure as Downing . Street gave a full version of 'The Day The Prime Minister and His Wife . Accidentally Left Their Daughter Behind In A Pub'. Eldest child Nancy became separated . from her parents after visiting the toilets as the family prepared to . leave the village gastropub close to the Prime Minister’s country . retreat, Chequers. Mr and Mrs Cameron, who were . travelling in separate cars, each believed Nancy was with the other and . were 'distraught' to discover she was missing when they reached . Chequers. Mrs Cameron, 41, who also has . children Arthur, six, and Florence, 22 months, swiftly returned to the . pub and was reunited with her daughter within 15 minutes. Error: The Plough pub, where the Camerons accidentally left their daughter Nancy when they drove off in separate cars . Easy: The Plough is a short drive away from Chequers, pictured . Yesterday, as the Camerons faced . criticism over the blunder, Mr Hollings described the PM as 'a great . father and genuine family man'. Mr Hollings, the former husband of . Carry On actress Barbara Windsor, said the family were regular visitors . to his pub, The Plough at Cadsden, a Buckinghamshire hamlet a few miles . from Chequers, and described the couple and their children as 'charming'. He said: 'The Camerons had been . sitting outside with two other family groups who seemed to be personal . friends. Mr Cameron just had a pint of bitter and then they all left. 'Then Nancy came out of the toilets . and said something like: “Where are my parents?” We knew who Nancy was . and looked after her until she was collected.' An insider at the pub added: 'I know . there were a lot of children there that day but I still don’t quite . understand how they lost their daughter in such a small pub and then . drove off without her. You would have thought the security officers . would do a head count.' Chillaxing? David Cameron enjoys a pint during a visit to a brewery . In a new biography, friends of Mr . Cameron last month told how he enjoyed drinking 'three or four glasses . of wine' over lunch at the weekend, while one source told the authors: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for ""chillaxing"", the Prime Minister . would win it.' Mr Hollings yesterday denied any suggestion that Mr Cameron had more than a single drink. A senior Downing Street source said . the incident happened when the three families returned to Chequers in a . convoy of cars. He said: 'David grabbed five children and Samantha did . the same. It was not a case of each family travelling back in a certain . car. 'Nancy had wandered away. But she is a . clever girl and revealed herself to the landlady. Nancy had a whale of a . time helping the landlady. They go to the pub regularly and [staff] . know the Camerons well.' He said the incident happened 'two or . three months ago' after the three families had walked the two miles . from Chequers for pre-lunch drinks at the pub. The spokesman said that was something of a 'ritual' each Sunday, before the group would drive back to Chequers for lunch. As if to illustrate the point, the . family visited the pub again on Sunday, with Mr Cameron spotted carrying . a small child in a backpack-style baby carrier. Clare Bonnick, 51, said . she was visiting the pub with a walking group when the Camerons and a . couple of other families walked in. Mrs Bonnick said they arrived on foot but left in three black cars, apparently driven by protection officers. She added: 'There were about six . adults and at least as many children and they were all getting into . different cars. It was easy to see how they could have lost one of the . children.' Pub regular Norman Meade, 89, said . he often saw Mr Cameron at The Plough on a Saturday – usually enjoying a . drink with just his police protection officer for company. Mr Meade added: 'He’s a decent bloke . who will come over and shake my hand. But how could  you do that? Walk . away and leave  a baby?' Parents on website Mumsnet also expressed surprise at Mr  Cameron’s forgetfulness. One wrote: 'I don’t understand how this could happen when they surely have police protection officers with them.'","The Camerons only realised Nancy was missing once they arrived home, two-miles away from the pub .

"Who are you calling old? Only 6 per cent of over-65 see themselves as 'old' They may be drawing a pension, but don’t dare call them old. With role models such as the Queen and Dame Judi Dench – and an increasing life-expectancy – only a tiny fraction of Britain’s over-65s now view themselves as elderly and frail. A survey of 2,000 aged between 65 and 93 found only 6 per cent feel their age changes the way they live their life and would class themselves as ‘old’. Over-65s now total a sixth of the . population and their numbers are set to nearly double from ten to . 19million within the next four decades. By 2050 one-in-four of the population will be aged over 65. But . they raised concerns that ageism was holding them back, with almost . half of those polled claiming their generation is ignored, while a more . than a third felt they were treated badly because of their age. For . those nearing their retirement years, there is good news - almost half . of said they were happier post-65 than at any other point in their life. Despite . more than 60 per cent refusing to define themselves as ‘old’ because it . was simply a mindset, almost the same number felt they are more likely . to be seen as a problem by society. More . than three out of five pensioners admit they have not seriously thought . about the type of care and support they would prefer as they get older, . leading experts to call for adults to do more to take control of their . future independence. With a . fifth fearing they will be classed as a burden to friends and family as . they age, This Morning presenter Ruth Langsford said there needs to be a . fresh discussion of the issues. She said the stigma about care and support must be addressed by individuals, after she was forced to take tough decisions about her own parents’ care needs. Golden years: Almost half of those polled said they were happier post-65 than at any other point in their life . ‘My own wonderful parents ended up bottling up worries and concerns because they feared being seen as a burden to us, meaning we couldn’t talk openly about their needs,’ she said. The poll was conducted by Invicta Telecare, Britain’s largest independent provider of telecare services, which helps more than 100,000 people live independently in their in their own home. ‘With the number of us aged 65 and over set to increase rapidly, it’s important to tackle the old fashioned taboos that many are coming up against. 'We all need to be prepared to discuss this subject more openly within our families and make sure people get access to the right information and help for them,’ said Wendy Darling, managing director at Invicta Telecare, who carried out the research. ‘It’s clear many worry they will lose their identity and be seen as a problem as they grow older so it’s important not to underestimate the support out there which will give full control of your freedom and independence.’","Nearly 95 per cent of over-65's do not consider themselves 'old'

"When Salih Saruhan began suffering from a runny nose during his hairdressing training, he put it town to a cold. He never dreamt it would be an allergy to the very thing he would work with every day - human hair. The 21-year-old barber from Sheerness, Kent, gets itchy eyes and a bunged up nose whenever he cuts hair - and it gets worse the curlier the locks. Despite his allergy, he refuses to change career, instead battling his symptoms with a nasal spray and two prescribed antihistamine tablets a day. Salih Saruhan gets hay fever-like symptoms, including itchy eyes and a bunged up nose whenever he cuts hair . The problem started two years ago when Mr Saruhan gave up his labouring job and moved to London to re-train as a stylist. Shortly into his training he started suffering hay fever-like symptoms - and baffled doctors eventually diagnosed an allergy to human hair. It is thought the problem arises when he breathes in tiny particles of hair which float around the air after it has been cut. Undeterred, and determined to finish the course, Mr Saruhan emerged with the highest grade the school has ever given out. And despite the unusual allergy he cannot see himself doing any other job. He said: 'I am lucky I really enjoy what I do so I am not going to let the sniffles stop me. 'I finally found something I like, but I ended up being allergic to it. The Turkish barber thought he was suffering from a bad mid-winter cold when he began his training two years ago, before eventually being diagnosed with an allergy to human hair . 'When the symptoms first started I thought it was a mid-winter cold, I had a blocked nose and my eyes were really itchy. 'I left the salon and my sinuses cleared up, my eyes gradually started to ease off. 'The doctor told me that it was really unusual for a person to have an allergic reaction to human hair as it is usually animal hair or fur which affects people. 'I've been prescribed different medicines and remedies but nothing really works. 'I just try to live with it.' And it's curly locks that seem to be particularly troublesome. 'I will often have a really bad attack when I have been cutting curly hair. It is a bit of a nuisance but it doesn't affect the way I cut,' he added. Mr Saruhan qualified as a bricklayer after studying the profession vocationally at school and college when he was 16. He first discovered his allergy two years ago, when he enrolled on a 10-week intensive course in London. During his training Mr Saruhan found he was allergic to the workplace, developing the sneezes and itchy eyes. His teachers suggested he see a professional but he stumped doctors as they had never heard of someone being allergic to human hair before. He assures customers his condition is not contagious and his nose does not drip, although he has to blow his nose every now and again to fight the symptoms.","Salih Saruhan gets itchy eyes and a blocked nose whenever he cuts hair - and it gets worse the curlier the locks .

"An alternative artist uses popcorn, nuts and grape stems to create incredible portraits. Victor Nunes, 65, from São Paulo makes creative pictures of faces, people and animals by combining pen and paper with household objects. The artist takes inanimate, mundane objects like nuts, scissors, fabric, foam, and food - and then doodles his ideas around them to create mini-masterpieces. Victor arranges popcorn on a page and creates 'Art Attack' style pictures full of character . The 65-year-old from São Paulo, Brazil, who has worked as an advertiser and art director since 1971, said: 'I've always played with images of food and other objects. In one picture he uses pieces of popcorn and kernel and imagines them as a multitude of animals including pigs, leopards, cows and dogs. In another, he manages to make a half-eaten Digestive biscuit represent a bra, bike helmet, umbrella and bicycle. 'I went in with my personal Facebook . page in February 2013 and started posting these images as an expression . of pure enjoyment,' he says. 'Every day I do something, for me, it is a kind of therapy. 'I have no preference for materials - I regard everything as a challenge but I try simple and easy things to find like coffee, dish cloths, floor cloths and food. 'I always seek more challenges to create art and use common things to create the unusual.' The artist takes mundane objects like grapes and then doodles his ideas around them . Victor imagines a dancer, umbrella, bike helmet and a bug using half-eaten Digestive biscuits . The re-imagining of inanimate, mundane objects is an example of the psychological phenomenon pareidolia. It causes people to see random images and perceive them as something significant. In this case, Victor manages to create numerous detailed pictures from plain objects. Our inclination to give meaning to random objects is the reason why we associate a smiley face with a human, and why some of Nunes' pieces of popcorn or biscuit resemble faces to us. Other examples of the phenomenon include seeing the image of Jesus in burnt toast or animal figures in clouds in the sky.

"The father of a missing six-year-old girl in Washington state was charged with molesting two young girls over a decade ago, it emerged today. James Aaron Wright has been co-operating with the investigation into the disappearance of his daughter Jenise, who was last seen by her family on Saturday going to bed in their mobile home in a rural section of Bremerton, near Seattle. It was not until the little girl missed dinner Sunday night that her parents called police, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Desperate . search: Jenise Wright went missing on Saturday and has not been seen . since despite a huge search involving the police, FBI, family and local . volunteers . Dark . past: James Wright, (pictured with Jenise's mother Denise) was arrested . in 2000 on felony charges of child molestation. The charges were . dropped when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge . Today it emerged James Wright, who goes by Jim, was arrested in 2000 on felony charges of child molestation in the first degree after an 8-year-old girl said he inappropriately touched them after a night of drinking. More than a year later, in June 2001, the charges were amended to include third-degree child molestation after a 15-year-old girl who was babysitting the girl during New Year's Eve 2000 said that Wright touched her breasts and put his hands down her pants. In court records filed in Whatcom County, Washington, the younger of his accusers said she had reported the incident to her mother who told her she would 'get a spanking' if she spoke of the incident again. The felony charges against Wright were . eventually dropped, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of . assault relating to the older child, court records show. A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions, including paying fees. It is not clear why the molestation charges were dropped. But Wright's attorney argued in court records that the young girl later told relatives she had been prompted to lie about the incident. James Wright and Jenise’s mother, Denise, took lie detector tests Monday but the results were not made public. Law enforcement wouldn't be drawn on Jim's past and referred questions about it to the prosecutor's office. The Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office, which is leading the investigation aided by the FBI, said both parents were distraught and cooperating fully with police. Jenise was well-known to all her neighbors, who described her as a talkative child who was unfazed by strangers. It was also not unusual for Jenise to be left without supervision for long periods of time, her parents told investigators. Hunt: More than 100 officers and dozens of community volunteers are . helping authorities search the woods around the Wright family's mobile . park community in hopes of turning up clues about Jenise's whereabouts . Mystery: . Investigators were also interviewing all sex offenders in the vicinity . as well as transients in the mobile park. The family’s home has also . been searched twice . 'She's really independent, she's tenacious,' the little girl's father told KOMO-TV. More than 100 officers and dozens of community volunteers were helping authorities search the woods around the Wright family's mobile park community in hopes of turning up clues about Jenise's whereabouts. The girl was either barefoot or in flip-flops upon her disappearance, officials said. Investigators were also interviewing all sex offenders in the vicinity as well as transients in the mobile park, sheriff’s spokesman Scott Wilson said. Jenise was the youngest child in the Wright household, a blended family that included both parents and three other siblings under the age of 18, authorities said. Two other adult children also live in the home. It was unclear what her parents did for work. The family’s home was searched twice and police were keeping a 24-hour blockade around the neighborhood’s perimeter, he said. James Wright said earlier this week he and his wife were stunned by Jenise’s disappearance. 'My head’s just swimming, I don't know what to think,' Wright told local Fox affiliate Q13. 'She went to bed (Saturday night), she was asleep. Wake up, (and think) she’s probably out running and playing,' he said. The family has not made a public appearance to plead for help in finding their daughter, but friends and neighbors said they were extremely worried. Mary Pelnar, 14, said she was friends with Jenise and the girl’s older sister, and described Jim and Denise as being 'like family'. 'I watched her mom sit on the couch and look out the window and not talk, and I've never seen her mom that upset'. Shortly after Jenise's disappearance, Washington Child Protective Services took an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl from the home. Deputy Wilson would not disclose why the children were taken but said authorities believed the move was 'prudent'. Appeal: The family has not made a public . appearance to plead for help in finding their daughter, but friends and . neighbors said they were extremely worried . Pelnar said she believed the move left the family torn apart in their darkest hour. 'I think they should have left them with the mom and dad because I've been in that house, and been there enough to know that the parents wouldn't do anything to their kids and it's a safe house,' she said. Distraught members of the community said their community has always been safe for children, though some questioned why the young girl was allowed to roam for extended periods without checking in with adults. Ruby Faaita, whose six-year-old daughter Mona is a classmate and friend of the missing girl, said she would not feel comfortable leaving her child with little supervision. 'I can't really say what their position was in it but I wouldn't let my daughter be out that way,' she said. Jenise is 3 feet tall, weighs 45 pounds and is white, Native American and Filipino. She has black hair and brown eyes.","Jenise Wright, of Bremerton, Washington, was last seen on Saturday night .

"An autopsy carried out on the body of a missing Oregon mother of two found dead on Tuesday morning has listed her cause of death as suicide. Jennifer Huston’s body was found near her SUV on a rural, remote road about 24 miles from her Dundee home. The Oregon State Medical Examiner’s Office listed her cause of death as asphyxiation on Wednesday, although toxicology results are still not available. Scroll down for video . An autopsy carried out on the body of Jennifer Huston, the missing Oregon mother of two who was found dead on Tuesday morning, has listed her cause of death as suicide . Inside the vehicle, detectives found a note addressed to members of Huston’s family. Her purse and personal items, which included her cell phone, were also located in the vehicle. The cell phone was detectives who found no indications of nefarious actives, reports KOIN. ‘Our hearts ache today. We have lost our . first born child. We have lost a wife and a mother. We don’t know what . lead Jennifer to this dark place and to this end and perhaps never will . understand this,’ said the Huston family in a statement. The 38-year-old had last been seen taking cash out at a bank, filling up her car with gas and . then buying snacks and non-lethal sleeping pills at a Rite Aid in nearby . Newberg around 6.22pm on July 24. Found: Missing Oregon mother Jennifer Huston was found Tuesday morning near her SUV, pictured, on a rural, remote road, police said . Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car . Detectives also found the empty box of . the sleeping aids that she had purchased at the Rite Aid pharmacy and a . gas receipt from the Circle K gas station in Newberg. Based . on the evidence, detectives and the medical examiner . said they concluded that Huston had died fairly close to the time she was . reported missing. Her cell phone stopped working minutes after she was seen at the gas station, but police said it was not due to a dead battery, according to Fox News, and she has not used her credit cards since. She told her husband, Kallen Huston, she had some errands to run, but then never returned home. At a press conference this week, Mr Huston said he believed that finding his wife's 99 Lexus would be the key to finding her. He also pleaded directly with his wife for her safe return. Devastated: Jennifer's husband sobbed during a press conference Monday in which he begged her to come home . 'Jennifer, if you could see this or hear this, I love you,' Mr Huston said. 'You have a ton of support from the community. If you can come home, please do. The boys need you. I need you. I love you. He added: 'We'll never stop looking for you.' Local police called off their search on Friday with one final aerial search across rural roads in the area. They also visited the San Juan Islands where the family used to visit but made no progress. 'After . [Friday's] flight, the Yamhill County Sheriff's Office will have . covered all rural areas of Yamhill County and no further search efforts . are planned for Yamhill County,' a spokesperson for the sheriff's office . said. 'If additional information arises, search efforts will be resumed as necessary.' A clearly emotional Mr Huston, flanked by fellow members of her family, said he keeps calling his wife's cell phone even though it's been turned off on the hope someone might finally answer. Last seen: Police released these surveillance footage . stills of Mrs Huston's car at a gas station just minutes before she vanished last Thursday. Her cell phone stopped working shortly after . As to questions surrounding her final . known purchases, a Gatorade, trail mix, and sleeping aids, her husband . said they were not a cause for alarm - the sports drink was because it . was a hot day, the trail mix was something they had in the house often, . and the pills could be attributed to a headache she'd been suffering . from for three days. He went on to call the disappearance 'completely out of character for her. She loves me, She loves the boys.' Captain . Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a . 1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 . miles after she filled up the tank. Mrs Huston was a stay-at-home mother . to her two sons, aged two and six. Her husband previously said he'd told . them she was on vacation because he couldn't bear to tell them the . truth. He also expressed . his fears that she might be 'in a ditch somewhere' after driving her . car off the road and urged motorists to look out for his wife. 'I ask that anybody helping us, . regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the . side of the highways,' he said. 'This is totally unlike her. She's a . devoted mother.

"The 10 golden rules to help avoid dementia have been unveiled by British scientists. From popping a fish oil pill to enjoying a glass of red wine, the simple everyday lifestyle changes can cut the risk of the disease by more than half, they say. Another recommendation is ballroom dancing - because having to remember the steps boosts brain function, say the experts. Taking up ballroom dancing or playing suduko are among the 10 simple lifestyle changes that can help stave off dementia, Scottish researchers say . Factor in eating well, exercise and enjoying life and you can significantly reduce your risk, say the experts from the University of Stirling’s Dementia Services Development Centre. They devised the 10 easy rules a a way to try and keep the debilitating symptoms of the disease. There are 800,000 people with dementia in the UK, and one in three people over 65 will die from the degenerative disease. And earlier this year, U.S. researchers warned that dementia rates will tripe by 2050 if we continue to live unhealthy lifestyles. Taking vitamins such as B6 and E . Take fish oils . Drink green tea . Drink the odd glass of red wine . Don’t get drunk . Take some physical activity . Enjoy a rich and stimulating environment . Keep your brain active . Dance . Don’t worry about life . Commenting on the 10 lifestyle recommendations, Professor June Andrews, from the University of Stirling, told the Daily Express: 'This is meant to be a cheerful list of positive things we can all do to help ourselves. They are not going to do any harm and there is research evidence that they can all help. 'We know we cannot affect the final outcome. When people are told they have dementia and it cannot be treated, that gives them the feeling there is nothing they can do. 'But if people are on that journey, the message is to live as well as you can and this list can help them do that.' Just last week, Boston researchers found that a rigorous walk could hold the key to slowing the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s in later life. A natural chemical produced by the body during exercise could one day be given as an injection to inhibit the diseases, the researchers said. The protein, called FNDC5, is produced by muscular exertion and is released into the bloodstream as a hormone called irisin. And Swedish research published earlier this month found that stress in middle age . could increase the risk of suffering dementia in later life. Some studies also show that eating fish oils, such as omega fatty acids, can slow the progress of Alzheimer's . They found conditions such as Alzheimer’s may be linked to the amount of stress experienced up to four decades earlier. Professor Andrews added that certain vitamins such as B6 and E have been shown to cut the risk of Alzheimer's. A regular glass of wine can also appears to have benefits, but the researchers point out that binge drinking has been linked to an increased risk of dementia. Drinking a regular glass of wine also has benefits but the group . warns against getting drunk, as the number of young people with dementia . caused by heavy drinking is increasing. Some studies also show that eating fish oils, such as omega fatty acids, can slow the progress of Alzheimer’s.","The simple everyday lifestyle changes can cut the risk of the disease by more than half, say Scottish scientists .

"Cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone are still rising quickly, campaigners have warned. In rural parts of the country, the virus is spreading nine times faster than two months ago, a report from the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI) found. AGI - an organisation set up by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair – said rates are also increasing in the capital Freetown, with six times more new cases recorded per day than two months ago. The news comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) advised that the number of new cases of the disease is levelling off. The Africa Governance Initiative has warned that Ebola is spreading up to nine times faster than two months ago in some areas of Sierra Leone. Their report found a plateuing of infection rates in Liberia. Pictured here, Liberian healthcare workers collect the body of a victim on the outskirts of Monrovia . Prayers are made for an Ebola victim in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The AGI report said rates are increasing quickly there, with six times more new cases recorded per day than two months ago . The AGI said that burial management had 'significantly improved' in Liberia and Sierra Leone. here, health workers cover the body of a man suspected of dying of Ebola near Monrovia, Liberia . Nick Thompson, AGI's chief executive, told BBC news: 'What we're seeing is a varied picture across the country. There are areas where it's still going up quite dramatically. 'Particularly in the western area, the rural areas, the area around and behind Freetown on the western peninsula. 'That's where you're seeing quite dramatic rises in cases, up to nine times more per day than two months ago. 'It's a very mixed picture, it's a changing situation within and across the country. It's still very much an acute crisis, there's no room for complacency even if response steps up.' The spread of the disease has only started to slow down in one area of Sierra Leone: Bombali, in the country's north, the report said. Mr Thompson added that the AGI did find that reports rates of the disease plateauing in Liberia, but they are not certain why. These are figures of deaths from Ebola up to October 29 . There have been a total of 4,951 of deaths from Ebola, up to the 29th October. Liberia: 2,413 . Sierra Leone: 1,510 . Guinea: 1,018 . Nigeria: 8 . United States: 1 . Mali: 1 . Source: World Health Organisation . He said that burial management has 'improved significantly' in Liberia and Sierra Leone, with an increased number of bodies buried in 24 hours. Being able to get bodies buried 'safely, promptly and with dignity' is going to be one of the key ways of breaking the chain of transmission, he added. Currently more than half of all infections of the virus are transmitted through dead bodies, because of local customs which involve washing the bodies of people who have died. Ebola is spread through blood or body fluids, including urine, saliva, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk, and semen of a person who is sick with Ebola . It can also be spread from objects like needles and syringes that have been contaminated with the virus, or through infected fruit bats or primates. Last week, the AGI warned that even if existing international commitments are met by December, there could be a shortage of over 6,000 beds across Sierra Leone and Guinea. Nearly half of the beds currently planned in the three countries will lack the medical staff needed, their study found. AGI based its projections on the WHO's worst-case scenario, which forecast 10,000 new cases per week in December. Nick Thompson said: 'The international community badly misjudged the impact of the Ebola epidemic in its first few months and is compounding that error by failing to act quickly enough now.' United States, Briatin and Cuba have sent military and medical personnel to West Africa to help control the epidemic. Here, British troops deliver a training course at a nursing school in Freetown, Sierra Leone . He called on more countries to follow the examples of the United States, Britain and Cuba, who have sent military and medical personnel to West Africa to support efforts to stop the epidemic at its source. The death toll from Ebola has risen to nearly 5,000 people - mainly across Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. At the end of October the WHO said there had been 13,567 cases since the outbreak began. Today, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned against 'uneccesarily' strict restrictions on the movement of health workers coming from West Africa. Canada and Australia have barred entry for citizens from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, while some U.S. states have imposed quarantines on health workers returning from these countries.","Virus is spreading nine times faster than two months ago in rural areas .

Scoble praised the device as being far more social than a cell phone, for having excellent voice command software, and for a camera that 'totally changes photography' by allowing you to capture moments in a fraction of a second. He said the voice commands are tailored to such specific commands that 'accuracy' is 'crazy high, even if you have an accent.'

Bloomingdales 'get me these jeans,' he wrote. 'There is literally billions . of dollars to be made with this new commerce-based system, rather than . force us to sit and look at ads, the way Facebook and tons of other . services do.'

"Al-Qaeda's Twitter account has now been suspended. After going live Tuesday under the guise of its Shamukh al-Islam website, the official website of the terror organization, the @shomokhalislam account was suspended Sunday after just under 50 tweets. The account’s suspension came only hours after a report critical of Twitter remaining silent as to why it was allowed to remain online for so long . Terrifying: al-Qaeda has started its own Twitter account . First reported Friday by the Washington Free Beacon, the terror group's account was open less than a week before Twitter pulled the plug. The decision to take down Shamukh al-Islam's Twitter came only hours after TheBlaze reported the site was remaining silent on why the account was still up. 'We don’t comment on individual Twitter accounts, for security and privacy reasons,' Twitter spokesperson Nu Wexler told MailOnline. Mr Wexler then referred to the site's rules barring targeted abuse or harassment as likely reasons why @shomokhalislam was suspended as it grew increasingly bolder, tweeting updates about attacks, and even justifications for them. The Twitter account was not locked or kept private, and its followers appear mostly to be journalists and curious gawkers. The website administering it is closed to the public. Some of the postings, translated to English, were accounts of operations. Others were religious decrees and links to statements on the Shamukh al-Islam website and YouTube videos. 'Dear Brothers, the Mujahideen today are going through a period of great scrutiny and trial Be them good Nassara, and certain after God,’ read one tweet. Potential recruiting tool: New recruits belonging to Somalia's al-Qaeda-linked al Shabaab rebel group march during a passing out parade . 'Peshawar from New burn under the feet of the servants of worshipers of the cross, the explosive device was detonated now targeting Bus least the staff of the Ministry of Interior of Pakistan in Peshawar,' read another, before giving a death toll of 17, with 35 injured in the attack. 'The attack killed more than 17 people dead and inflicted 35 wounded in the initial toll expected to rise .. Source Brother Fadil Abu Maaz Kouhati,' said the most recent tweet sent from the account. Had it been allowed to remain online, it likely would have been subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny. Prior to the account's suspension, terror analysts speculated it was likely a shift in strategy for the notoriously cryptic terror group. Despite . well-known power struggles among different al-Qaeda factions, the . Twitter account's administrator had pledged to remain neutral and focus . on spreading the terror group's message, according to the Times. Had it been allowed to remain online, it likely would have been subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny. Spreading the word: An Al Qaeda Fighter shows his AK-47 machine gun with Arabic language professing allegiance to 'al-Qaeda' organization . ‘We’ve seen terrorist groups make . increasingly effective use of social media, particularly Twitter and . Facebook, in recent years,’ Patrick Poole, a counterterrorism expert, . told the Washington Times. ‘Not only is this important for propaganda purposes but also recruitment,' he added. It also may have allowed al-Qaeda the capability to streamline distribution of directives or celebratory announcements. 'If the dissemination of official releases is no longer to be done centrally, it has the potential to make the forums obsolete and usher in a new era whereby jihadi activists primarily rely on social media platforms to interact with one another,' Aaron Zelin, a counterterrorism analyst, told the Times. No reason has been given for the account's suspension, but one only needs to look at why the site suspended al-Shabaab's account multiple times during the Kenyan mall seige. The al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists also violated rules pertaining to threatening behavior or violence.","The suspension comes less than a week after the account went live .

"Little Hunter Alford needs chemotherapy to treat the rare and deadly cancer he was born with but has lost his health insurance under an administrative blunder seemingly caused by Obamacare. While the president's signature policy promised that no one with a pre-existing condition would not be covered, the Affordable Care Act has seemingly caused the seven-year-old Gainesville, Texas, boy to face an agonizing wait for treatment as his parents battle to get him back on his insurance plan. 'Why would you cancel a kid?' asked his mother Krista Alford. 'I really want to send Obama and all of them pictures of my son. He has scars all over his head. He doesn’t want to leave the house because he’s afraid people are going to make fun of him because he’s bald.' Desperate: Hunter Alford needs treatment for his rare cancer but has been left uninsured after a administrative glitch caused by the introduction of Obamacare . Tragic: While the president's signature policy promised that no one with pre-existing condition would not be covered, the Affordable Care Act has seemingly caused the seven-year-old Gainsville, Texas, boy to lose his insurnance . While mom Krista and dad Ron go out their minds with worry, Hunter - who was born with an extremely rare form of cancer called Plexiform Hishocyne Neoplasm -  is battling the disease which has now spread to his brain. But after seven years of fighting his illness, Hunter's insurance has been canceled and he is due his next round of chemo, which costs $50,000 and right now, Krista says he is unlikely to get it. The Alford's are battling with children's medicaid, or CHIP - which insures Hunter and despite the family receiving a new, renewed insurance card, they were informed that their agency had dropped them. 'I called them and they said we were dropped October 31st,' Krista said to News 12. She was told that her sons information was lost when administrative changes were made under the Affordable Care Act. 'The lady's like, the only way we can expedite is if your son was pregnant and in labor, or if he was an illegal,' Krista said. The parents said Hunter 'has known nothing other than hospitals, doctors, sickness and pain.' Distraught: Mother Krista has been left out of her mind with worry by the loss of Hunter's insurance and the bureaucratic minefield she is having to through to fix it . Krista was incredulous when she received a letter in November from her insurance provider asking why her son - who has been covered by them his entire life - was in hospital in the first place. Krista reasoned that after seven-years of paying for his medical bills, the insurance company would have a good idea of what was wrong with him. Despite Krista's insistence that the Affordable Care Act has caused her son to be un-insured, a media spokesperson with Texas Health and Human Services Communication - who handle CHIP - said that the problem does not lie with Obamacare. However she did admit to administrative changes that could have led to mistakes moving Hunter from CHIP to an upgraded version of Medicaid. She repeated that the problem was not related to Obamacare, but there  were some 'glitches' in coverage when the changeover happened. Ron Alford with his daughter Makayla and son Hunter - he is a police officer in Gainsville and struggling to get his children the health care they have been insured for their entire lives . However, it seems that one of those glitches caused a little boy with life-threatening cancer to lose his health insurance. Over the past month Krista has been stuck in a bureaucratic hell - being passed from one agency telephone helpline to the next. Each one has brought her no closer to an answer or a resolution. Krista said she’d had Hunter's current insurance for a year-and-a-half and had never received any notice that she needed to 'requalify' her children because of Obamacare. When she phoned to complain Krista says, 'all of a sudden could not find my son case, at all. And then, she transferred me over to another gentleman who found his case. He said it was hidden, because when they switched over to HHSC (Texas Health and Human Services Commission), they lost a lot of cases files and Hunter’s was just one of those.' The more she asked, the more confusing the answers became. 'Then they told me October 17th was when he was actually canceled. But on October 25 he had chemo, and they paid for it. So, I am getting different stories.' Tough: Hunter has been ill his entire life and needs another round of chemotherapy to battle his rare form of cancer . The latest development in the shocking case is one that the wife of a small town police officer finds hard to believe. 'Now, the new story with CHIP is they called and said my husband makes too much money, $173 too much. 'So, I’m very upset. I was bawling on the phone with her and the only thing she said was, ‘Have a nice day,’ and she hung up.' To make matters worse, the Alford's have been told that their son's cancer is not only rare but behaving in an unusual manner. 'These tumors are very rare. They are not supposed to spread, but his decided they were going to spread. And it can go into his lungs, because the tumors like soft tissue, and your lungs are soft tissue.' With Hunter desperately in need of a new round of Chemotherapy, Krista has said the family have no choice but to accept the massive $50,000 bill for it with no insurance. However, they have set up a fund for people to help - 'Heroes for Hunter' and so far they have raised $11,005 - but everything will help.","A Gainesville, Texas family is fighting for their cancer-stricken child's life after he was removed from his insurance plan .

"A 30-year-old professional surfer and model has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly following an elderly woman back to her apartment and running her down as part of a road rage incident. Jill Hansen was formerly charged around 8pm on Friday in Hawaii following the attack in Waikiki, Honolulu, around noon on Wednesday, Hawaii News Now reported. A witness, Chris Khory, has told police that he stopped Hansen from hitting the 73-year-old victim, identified as Elizabeth Conklin, a second time by smashing her back window with a crowbar. Khory said after knocking Conklin down Hansen got out of her Volkswagen sedan, looked at her, got back in the car and reversed, according to Khon2. Scroll down for video . Charged: Jill Hansen, 30, has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly running down an elderly woman with her car in Waikiki . Jill Hansen was arrested on suspicion of intentionally striking a 73-year-old woman in a Wai­kiki parking garage with her car. She has a history of driving problems . In an effort to get Hansen's attention and stop her from hitting the woman again, a bystander used a crowbar to break one of the car's windows . Hansen is alleged to have followed the victim back to her apartment complex in Waikiki, waiting for her to get out of the car and then running her down . Jill Hansen is a self-described professional surfer and model . Khory, who works at the apartment complex on Kalakaua Ave, said he quickly grabbed a crowbar and ran over and smashed Hansen's back window. Stunned, Hansen got and fled, leaving behind her car. Police used it to track her down, arresting Hansen six hours later in the Manoa area. Conklin was taken to hospital with cuts, bruises and a head injury. She was hospitalized in serious condition, emergency officials said. This is not Hansen's first run-in with police. She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. Police used Hansen's car, which she left at the scene after running away, to identify her and track her down . Police arrested 30-year-old Jill Anjuli Hansen shortly after 7 pm on May 14 . The incident occurred in the garage of the Diamond Head Apartments on Kalakaua Ave in Waikiki . Surfer Jill Hansen was arrested for attempted murder . There is also an active restraining order filed by her father. According to the court documents, her father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family. She has multiple rants on the social media site. She claims to be a professional surfer and model and lashes out at critics. Hansen has not yet been charged. According to the court documents, Hansen's father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family. He has a restraining order against his daughter . Police said Hansen followed the older woman through the parking garage's security gate and then intentionally hit the woman with her car after she had exited her vehicle . Police said Hansen and the older woman do not know each other, and there was no apparent motive . According to Insurance News Net, Hansen is known in Honolulu for being a worry on the roads. A member of the Mau­na­lani Heights Neighborhood Security Watch, who asked not to be identified, said the group alerted its members about Hansen last year after several incidents involving erratic driving and behavior. 'We needed everybody on the lookout for her - that's how scary it was,' the member said. 'All 500 members were eventually brought into the loop of this situation because it was so serious.' 'There were probably over half a dozen people that had been adversely affected by her driving. 'Two people almost run over by her, one person almost had a head-on collision with her.' Hansen was not arrested in connection with those incidents, the member said. Bad reputation: Jill Hansen was allegedly known around her neighborhood for her driving record, and not in a good way, sources say . According to court records, Hansen was cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time on Sunday. In that incident she was allegedly driving 72 mph in a 35 mph zone in Wahiawa. She is set to appear in court for that case in June. She was also ticketed for using a mobile electronic device while driving in July. She received a $147 fine. In addition, in 2011 she received fines for disregarding a stop sign, driving without a license and driving without insurance. In 2013 she was fined for driving without headlights. She has two convictions, one for speeding and the other for driving without a license in 2010, according to the state Criminal Justice Data Center. Besides her driving offenses, Hansen was arrested April 18 for investigation of third-degree assault. She is scheduled to appear for that case in District Court on Friday.

"We could soon be able to design cells or entire organisms using computer software and 3D printers, a scientist has claimed. The cells could be used to create biofuels, combat global warming, develop new healthcare and medicines and even recreate alien lifeforms on earth, if alien DNA is ever found. J.Craig Venter - who helped map the . human genome and created the world's first synthetic life form in 2010 - . details the theory in his new book Life at the Speed of Light: From the . Double Helix to the Dawn of Digital Life. J.Craig Venter - who created the world's first synthetic life form in 2010 - believes we could soon be designing cells and organisms using computer software and 3D printers. The cells could be used to create biofuels, combat global warming, develop new medicines and even recreate alien lifeforms . 'The day is not far off when we will . be able to send a robotically controlled genome sequencing unit to other . planets to read the DNA sequence of any alien microbe life that may be . there,' claimed Venter. 'If we can beam them back to Earth we should be able to . reconstruct their genomes. The synthetic version of a Martian genome . could then be used to recreate Martian life on Earth.' This could even be reversed, and if . aliens pick up digital transmissions of human DNA they could recreate . humans on their planet. Talking to The Sunday Times, Venter claims the synthetic cells could be designed using specifically designed software. Venter, pictured, is the president of . the J. Craig Venter Institute, which conducts research into synthetic . biology. He is seeking to patent the first . lifeform created by humans, dubbed Mycoplasma . laboratorium. In 2000, Venter and Francis Collins from the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Public Genome Project claimed they had mapped the entire human genome. A DNA molecule - shaped similar to a spiral staircase or ladder - is made up of chemicals that link together and form the rungs of this ladder shape. The sides of the ladder are made of sugar and phosphate. Human bodies have around 3 billion base pairs, but only 4 per cent of those pairs are said to influence how genes react and behave. The finished sequence was completed, with 99.99 per cent accuracy in 2003. In May 2010, Venter was part of a team that became the first to successfully create 'synthetic life.' They did this by adding a long DNA . molecule containing a bacterium genome into another cell. The team analysed the . genome of a microbe and reconstructed it from laboratory . chemicals before inserting the finished DNA into a bacterial . cell, which began to grow and reproduce. Scientists would then be able to manipulate and modify the DNA by adding certain features to create tailor-made microbes. These advances in genome technology will form part of a 'genetic revolution', according to Venter, and 'could give humanity crops resistant to . drought and disease and artificial animals that could yield both food . and drugs.' The cells could also be used to increase intelligence, or even extend human life. By designing the cells on a computer, they would become digitised, making it possible to send the sequencing around the world over the web.

"House Republicans considered this morning lifting the ban on congressional earmarks that allow federal lawmakers to direct certain contracts, projects and 'pork' spending to their home districts. As it currently stands, no earmarks of any kind can be tacked onto legislation that originates in the House or the Senate, with both chambers having banned the targeted appropriations several years ago in the name of fiscal responsibility. Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers wanted the House to make an exception to the  moratorium for the next Congress for 'State, locality (including county and city governments), or a public utility or other public entity.' But House Speaker John Boehner was able to talk his caucus out of it, a source familiar with the proceedings told MailOnline. Congressman Mike Rogers, right,  lead a behind the scenes effort at today's House GOP rules meeting to get the ban on congressional earmarks lifted so that members can again bring home the bacon by directing federal spending to their home districts but House Speaker John Boehner, right, talked his caucus out of it . Boehner spoke in opposition to Rogers amendment during the meeting, the source said, and it was successfully defeated. Congress banned earmarks, in part, to curb abuse by lawmakers who would hold government projects hostage in order to force their colleagues to vote their way their way on certain pieces of legislation. The process also led to wasteful spending, including on the infamous Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska. The way Rogers and other lawmakers who want the ban lifted see it, however, federal funds are either going to be appropriated by the legislative branch or the Obama administration, so Congress may as well take back the reigns. 'I do not believe most people trust how President Obama spends our tax dollars,' Rogers told MailOnline in an email today. 'This proposal would allow the conservative, Republican-controlled House to reassert its Constitutional authority over the Obama Administration and the spending decisions it is currently making.' House Republicans discussed the measure in a closed-door rules meeting and made the decision via secret ballot. Given that GOP controls a majority of seats in the lower chamber, any action by Republicans this morning would have led to an official lifting of the ban on certain types of earmarks in the House, and potentially in the Senate, where senior Democrats have been trying revive the measure since last summer. Like Rogers, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid believes the earmark ban has reallocated at spending power meant for the legislature to the executive branch and he would like to see it given back to lawmakers. 'I have never backed down from my support of congressionally directed spending,' Reid told the Huffington Post in June. 'That's our constitutional obligation and duty. I do not believe that the White House should make all these decisions. I am proud of all the earmarks I have gotten for the state of Nevada. They'll come back - it's only a question of time because that's our constitutional obligation.' At the time Reid claimed that 'a very senior member of the House Republican caucus' also wanted to see the restriction rolled back but he did not say who. Boehner's efforts to save the ban today signal that it was not him, however.","Alabama Rep.

"Crowds may have flocked to the National Mall to see President Obama make history in 2009, but the team behind the president's 2013 inauguration bash later this month are bracing themselves for a ton of empty seats. The ceremony . that Washington will stage in a few weeks won't be the historic affair . it was in 2009, when nearly 2 million people flocked to the Capitol o watch Obama take the oath of office. This time, District of Columbia . officials expect between 600,000 and 800,000 people for Obama's public . swearing-in on the steps of the Capitol on Monday, January 21. Staging area: D.C. officials are expecting between 600,000 and 800,000 people for Obama's public swearing-in on the steps of the Capitol on Monday, January 21 . Two weeks before the big day, plenty of . hotel rooms still haven't been booked. Four years ago, some hotels sold . out months in advance. There will be just two official inaugural . balls this year, both at the Washington Convention Center, rather than . 10 official balls at multiple locations around town. The pair of celebrations are the lowest number since 1953, according to the New York Post. A political insider told the paper: 'Some on the presidential inaugural committee are starting to seriously worry.' His inaugural committee has also scaled the celebration back to three days of festivities, instead of four. Some changes are on account of the . slowly recovering economy and a desire by planners to ease the security . burden on law enforcement. Swearing in: The First Lady Michelle Obama holds the Lincoln Bible as President Obama takes the oath of office in 2009, this time he will use two Bibles . Turnout: The 2013 inauguration isn't expected to draw the same crowd that flocked to the event in 2009, pictured . But they also reflect a realization that the thrill for Obama's second inauguration burns a little weaker. 'There certainly will not be the sort of exultation you saw four years ago,' said Mike Cornfield, a George Washington University political science professor. One reason why, Cornfield said, is it simply lacks the dramatic transfer of power from one president to the next. Sealed with a kiss: Michelle Obama is seen holding the Lincoln Bible, first used at the 16th president's inauguration in 1861 . 'This is not a change that commands people's interest automatically,' Cornfield said. 'It's a confirmation of power.' Even Obama acknowledges he's already, shall we say, a little washed-up the second time around. 'I think that a lot of folks feel that, ""Well, he's now president. He's a little grayer. He's a little older. It's not quite as new as it was,""' the president often told supporters while campaigning for re-election. There will be a parade, but it's expected to be smaller too; about 130 groups and 15,000 people marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House in 2009. Obama will be sworn in first on January 20, the date set by the Constitution, but it will be done in private since the day falls on a Sunday. His public swearing-in the next day also falls on the federal holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., branding the occasion with another layer of historical significance, especially for African-Americans. Lessened interest in the second inauguration of a two-term president such as Obama could be a natural function of America's political process, said Daniel Klinghard, associate professor of political science at the College of the Holy Cross. 'When it's your first [inauguration], you're new and people are only seeing the potential in you,' Klinghard said. 'By the time the second one rolls around they're used to your voice, they're used to you saying certain kinds of things.' One group for whom the Obama thrill remains strong is African-Americans, who overwhelmingly wanted him to have four more years in the White House. More than nine in 10 blacks voted to re-elect Obama, according to surveys of voters as they left their polling places in November. Victory: Obama, pictured with the first family on Election night, will be inaugurated for his second term privately on January 20, with a public ceremony to follow the next day . Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington office, said he has fielded hundreds of telephone calls and emails since the November 6 election from chapter officials in South Carolina, Florida, New York, Maine, California and Washington state, all wanting tickets for their members. Chapters from Richmond, Virginia, and Jackson, Mississippi, among others, are bringing groups to Washington for the festivities, he said. 'There's still a great deal of excitement within the African-American community about the second term of the first African-American president of the United States,' Shelton said. Victoria Wimberley, owner of an Atlanta-based event planning business, brought four busloads of people to Washington for the 2009 inauguration. She's coming again, though with two fewer buses, which she blamed on the high price for accommodations and not any lack of excitement for Obama. Superfan: Victoria Wimberley, who will be attending President Barack Obama's inauguration for the second time, looks over some of the memorabilia in her home in Decatur, Georgia . Selling: A vendor hawks Obama merchandise in Washington, DC, ahead of his inauguration later this month . Wimberley said she feels 'the same level of joy, happiness, excitement and celebration' for Obama's second swearing-in among the people she comes into contact with. 'Because now he can really go to work,' she said, explaining her view that another term should free him to govern without fear of any political repercussions. Some of those who wanted a seat on one of Wimberley's buses weren't as sure Obama would win in November as they were that he would win in 2008. As a result, they held off on booking hotel rooms. Then came Thanksgiving, preparing for Christmas and concerns about whether Obama and congressional Republicans would strike a deal to stop mandatory tax increases and spending cuts known as the 'fiscal cliff' from taking effect with the new year. Fitful negotiations went down to the wire, with Congress sending Obama a bill late on New Year's Day. When people did get around to pricing hotel rooms 'they just couldn't afford them,' Wimberley said. Many hotels are charging hundreds of dollars a night for a room and requiring guests to stay at least three nights or four nights. Cost has been 'the major conversation for lots and lots and lots of people,' Wimberley said.","Hotel rooms remain unbooked ahead of January 21 inauguration ceremony .

"Authorities came upon a grisly scene in Brooklyn Monday, discovering a woman who had lived with her mother's corpse for at least a year, putting it at the dinner table for a dining companion and cuddling next to it at night as she slept. 'It’s a scene right out of ‘Psycho’. . . This is one of the weirdest cases I’ve ever seen' said one law-enforcement source. According to The New York Post, Chava Stirn, 28, was discovered living with the corpse of mother Susie Rosenthal, 61.when emergency services was called to the apartment in Borough Park to respond to a complaint of a foul odor. Police arrived at this building in Brooklyn on Monday to find a woman who had been living with the remains of her dead mother for almost a year . Stirn was said to be behaving erratically and said she wanted to hurt herself. Her obsessions had gone so far that, like famous film murder Norman Bates, she even dressed up in her mother's clothes and was wearing the same black shoes and outfit Rosenthal had on when she died. The deceased's bones were resting on a bed of trash bags in the kitchen when authorities arrived. Stirn would often sleep next to the remains on a chair in the kitchen, leaving stacks of paper to cover her twin bed. Rosenthal's cause of death is uncertain. 'She may have been living there with the mom’s remains for two or three years . . . It’s a horrible scene,' the law enforcement source told the Post. An autopsy will be done to confirm the findings. Suspicions were only aroused when the building's super tried to investigate a leak coming from the apartment. Stirn refused to open up to emergency workers who were forced to knock the door down. They found her disheveled in her chair, with piles of trash around her up to her waist. She was apparently a shut-in who lived with her mother while the older woman was still alive. A relative would occasionally leave food outside her door. 'When I listened, she was screaming . . . [She yelled] ‘I kill myself, I kill myself!’' neighbobr Malka Le told reporters. Another unnamed neighbor said: 'I never saw her or her mother. They never came out. I never saw the door open.' Stirn was taken to the  Maimonides Medical Center for a psychiatric evaluation. Both woman reportedly exhibited psychological problems recent years, neighbor said. No charges have yet been filed.","Police responded to the scene to deal with a complaint of foul odor .

Memories of my Eighties childhood are speckled with images of my mother, wafting around the house before a night out, her head laden with heated rollers and pins, like a perfumed porcupine. Dynasty and Dallas were the TV shows of the day and hair was big. The heated rollers were Mum's weapons in her life-long battle to tease a little Krystle Carrington va-va-voom into her naturally straight tresses. She stayed loyal to her trusty Remingtons over the next 30 years, even as big hair fell out of fashion. In fact, it was that trusty box of rollers that elicited the biggest pang of nostalgia when I cleared out her things following her death, at the age of 81, in August. How could I possibly throw them away? I'm glad I didn't; big hair is back. With the Duchess of Cambridge and Cheryl Cole sporting big, bouncy, curly styles that would make Krystle - and Mum - proud, heated rollers are essential again. But how would Mum's rollers compete against the latest, 2013 versions? I put them to the test. On a roll: Angela wearing the Enrapture rollers and then immediately after they were taken out . The Enrapture effect: The final result . This set of 20 rollers - ten large for . 'extra volume curves' and ten medium for 'extreme curl' - are stored and . heated simultaneously on four lines of horizontal metal bars in a case . the size of a large handbag. Butterfly clips are attached round the . rollers so they get a blast of heat, too. An LED light goes red when the . rollers are ready. EASE OF USE: The rollers have a lovely velvet feel and take only two minutes to heat. There are plenty of them for my thick hair. The clips do get a little hot to handle, but thankfully they don't burn your head. Rolled out easily after 15 minutes. RESULT: Delivered a nice overall bounce rather than cascading waves. Not for lovers of really BIG hair if yours is quite long. But a good, mid-priced buy. BEST FOR: Thick hair. 3/5 . Budget: Remington Jumbo Curls Rollers . Ah Remington, the brand beloved of my mum. They have certainly come a long way. Only eight medium sized and four larger rollers, pictured right, each with a wax core that, according to the blurb, helps retain a high heat, setting curls faster. Each roller fits on a vertical bar so they heat simultaneously. EASE OF USE: Velvety and bristle-free, these rollers took nearly 15 minutes to heat. There's no indicator light so I had to guess. Even then, they still didn't feel too hot and it was fiddly getting the hair clips in place, resulting in some minor temper issues. RESULT: They give a tightly flicked curl rather than a cascading wave, but a reasonable price. BEST FOR: Budget buyers 2/5 . The set has 12 large, soft-to-the-touch, thermo-ceramic rollers that, so it's claimed, give a smooth, shiny finish. Like the Enrapture brand, the rollers line up on horizontal heated bars within the case, so they are easy to store. EASE OF USE: They take about three minutes to heat - a dot on top of each roller turns from red to white when they are ready - and they fasten into hair with easy-to-handle butterly clips. RESULT: Produces long waves rather than full curls - but since the rollers are quite large the overall look is quite soft. My hair had a nice bounce but nobody's going to invite me to join Girls Aloud any time soon. BEST FOR: Clumsy fingers 3/5 . These are the lightest and most portable. Twelve medium-sized rollers come complete with easy-to-use metal clips in a neat little zip-up storage case. EASE OF USE: Unfortunately you can heat up only six of the rollers - on vertical bars in the bottom of the case - at a time. Since the appliance takes ten minutes to reach a decent temperature to begin with, then a further six minutes to heat each set of rollers, getting the full set ready tested my patience. At least the rollers felt quite hot once they were in. RESULT: Oh dear - this resulted in straggly rats' tails, rather than big bouncy curls, and they dropped out fairly quickly. Redeemed only by the nice case and price. BEST FOR: Travelling light 1/5 . It may look like a small pudding bowl with a plug on the end but this, apparently, is the new dawn in hair rollers. And it is known as a pod: you pop rollers in individually and, thanks to the wonders of induction, they heat up in eight seconds. When the pod is ready, the word DIVA lights up - a lovely touch. But it's not cheap: you buy the rollers separately; they come in three sizes, and at nearly £30 for four that's serious cash. EASE OF USE: They feel heavy and hot on my head - just wearing four gave me a headache. The comb clips were a bit scratchy, too. RESULT: Fantastic. Big, generous waves fell around my face and I saw myself reborn as Holly Willoughby. BEST FOR: Quick results 5/5. Another one to rely on the pod system, the Velcro rollers are placed in one at a time and when ready to use eight seconds later, the pod bleeps and a blue light flashes. Better value than the Diva as you get 14 rollers - two large, eight medium and four small. EASE OF USE: It was a real grapple with the grip combs, they reminded me of those arcade games where you try to grab a toy with a giant claw. The flex is very short so you have to sit next to a plug point while they heat up, which is irritating. RESULT: I do like the effects. My hair is big and bouncy with some strong, springy curls pooling on my shoulders. BEST FOR: Those with lots of power points. 3/5 . Well these are very pretty to look at, see below, - two large, two medium and six small black and pink Velcro rollers in a rather fetching pink case. You know they've heated up when a dot on the rim of the rollers turns from green to dark grey - not an easy colour change to spot. During and after: Mark Hill's rollers are a pain to use but delivered some nicely flicked out waves . EASE OF USE: These take six minutes to cook and the thick bristles feel like rolling a loo brush in your hair. I also struggled threading the pin through the rim of the rollers. RESULTS: Delivered some nicely flicked out waves - think Pamela Anderson in Baywatch. The curls passed the tug-them-and-see-if-they-fall-out test. But they were such a pain to use. BEST FOR: Those with manual dexterity. 2/5 . The purse-aching price of a budget airline ticket to the Cannes Film Festival, this set is high-tech - the soft-grip rollers heat from cold to 130C in four seconds, while remaining cool to the touch. Only the core of the roller is heated, rather than the surface. An electronic beep and light alert you when each roller is ready. EASE OF USE: The problem with pod rollers is that you can't get into a rhythm. You have to keep stopping and starting to heat each one. RESULTS: I love the overall effect - a head of loose waves, which kink and curl rather fetchingly around the shoulders - very Kate Middleton. BEST FOR: Lottery winners and Duchesses. 4/5 . Compared to modern rollers, Mum's old ones are like an instrument of torture. With their spikes and surgical-style pins, I'm tempted to take a paracetamol to ease the pain of putting them in. Touchingly dated: They took a long time to heat up, but Mum's old rollers produced a nice ringlet effect . EASE OF USE: Heated up on vertical posts within a compact case, they took an hour - yes, a whole hour - to warm up. Though you do get a lot of rollers for your money: six big ones, ten medium sized and four small. The biggest were only the same size as the medium rollers in most of the modern sets. RESULT: Actually, the effect was really nice and touchingly dated since with so many smaller rollers it produced quite a ringlet effect that brushed out into beautiful waves. But they needed at least 40 minutes to produce a curl. My mum always liked it when I had curly hair - she railed against the fact I blow-dried it straight. So I hope this would have made her happy. BEST FOR: An afternoon of nostalgia. 3/5 .","Angela's mum loved va-va-voom tresses - even when they weren't in style .

"A German salesman 'sawed, hacked and sliced up' a bank clerk who had suffocated to death in a bizarre sex game gone wrong - before leaving his head 'bobbing in a stewpot'. Michael Schneider, 45, left 37-year-old Carsten Schmidt's severed head cooking on the stove at his apartment in Berlin, in what police described as a 'horror show'. After the sordid incident, remains of the victim's body were also found strewn around Schneider's home, wrapped in baking foil and paper. Michael Schneider, 45, has been jailed for four years after the Berlin regional Court heard he sliced up bank clerk Carsten Schmidt, 37, before cooking his head in a stewpot . Now Schneider has now been jailed for less than four years, after being found guilty of bodily harm resulting in death. A police official, who said the men knew one another, said: 'It was a . horror show. The body parts had been sawed, hacked and sliced. 'He put . them all over the apartment as if saving them up for a rainy day. 'But only the head was cooked, bobbing in a stewpot on top of the cooker.' During the hearing at the Berlin Regional Court, the court heard how the victim had invited Schneider to his apartment in Marienfelde, south Berlin, for sex in January 2012. In court, the defence claimed Schmidt asked the defendant to tie him to the bed and cover his mouth and nose with tape. The victim then died of suffocation, the court was told. It was then that Schneider cut up Schmidt's corpse. Schmidt, who was openly gay, was due to go on to a party that evening with his friend. When he did not show up, the friend alerted police. 'The body parts had been sawed, hacked and sliced. He put . them all over the apartment as if saving them up for a rainy day' Police officer . When it became clear Schneider was a suspect, the defendant slashed his wrists with a knife, but was saved by paramedica . During the trial, prosecutors argued that the defendant should have been sentenced to six years and nine months for manslaughter. But . his defence team called for their client . to be found guilty of bodily harm resulting in death rather than . manslaughter. They successfully argued that the victim had wanted to die and that the accused was used simply as 'a tool in that process'. In the court judgement it reportedly said: 'He is responsible for the death but he . didn't want to kill his sexual partner.' Cannibalism as a sexual fantasy is widespread in Germany.  It first hit the headlines in 2001 when Armin Meiwes killed, butchered and ate a computer technician called Bernd Brandes at his remote farmhouse home in Rotenburg near Kassel. At his trial, several men who harboured fantasies of eating human flesh testified that there was a large network of like-minded individuals who connected through cyberspace in a bid to satisfy their fantasies.

"This is the first picture of nun and new mother Roxana Rodriguez. The 33-year-old woman, a nun with the order of the Little Disciples of Jesus, stunned her mother superior and local church chiefs after giving birth last week to a baby boy which she has called Francis, in honour of the current Pope. Sister Roxana initially claimed to have no idea that she was pregnant and thought her labour pains were 'stomach cramps' when an ambulance rushed her to hospital in severe pain after being called by fellow nuns when she collapsed at her nunnery. Roxana Rodriguez, a nun with the order of the Little Disciples of Jesus, stunned her mother superior and local church chiefs after giving birth last week to a baby boy . Her picture was published in the Italian daily newspaper Corriere Della Sera, who have carried out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the birth of 9lb Francis and have spoken to the the social worker in the case. It shows Sister Roxana, who is currently in the first floor maternity unit at the San Camillo de Lellis hospital in Rieti, 50 miles north of Rome, as she took her vows and became a nun in the order last September. She told her social worker Anna Fontanella:'I am so happy. I feel more of a mother than a nun, I think that's obvious. I decided to call him Francis in honour of our wonderful south American Pope. I do not feel of guilt. I will be keeping him and bringing him up. 'He is a gift from God. I am little worried about all the publicity, not only in Italy but in El Salvador and all over the world. Everyone is talking about this and I don't think I will be able to return to my home country, let alone Rieti.' Sister Roxana has written a letter of apology to the order's mother superior general Elvira Petaraca - the woman who in September she solemnly promised to follow her vows of 'chastity, poverty and obedience', the three main pillars of the Little Disciples of Jesus Order. The nun had only arrived in Italy last summer at the nunnery in Rieti and has told officials that the father is a man from her native El Salvador but she has so far not named him. Father Benedetto Falcetti, priest at the nearby St Michael's church in Rieti, said: 'It all happened last spring, around March or April time when she was back in El Salvador to get her passport renewed. 'She has not said who the father is but I understand he is an, shall we say, old flame of hers from when she was younger. At some stage I expect she will tell the father that he has a son and they will be reunited but I don't know when that will be.' The nun stunned her mother superior and local church chiefs after giving birth last week to a baby boy which she has called Francis, in honour of the current Pope . However not all share Father Falcetti's delight at the birth, apart from the anger of her superiors, sister Roxana has also upset her fellow nuns at the convent in Campomoro. One nun who answered the telephone at the convent and who asked not to be named said:'No we must certainly not be going to visit her. What she has done is not right at all. She has betrayed her vows. She will not be coming back here.' Since news of the birth was announced the hospital has been flooded with gifts for the nun and her new baby including nappies, clothes and money. Hospital director Pasquale Carducci said:'We have had to put extra security on the maternity wing because of all the interest. Like any new mum she is delighted but obviously this has created a great deal of clamour because she is a nun. 'There have been calls and gifts from dozens of well wishers and she has passed on her thanks to all these people. Medically she and the baby are doing well and I expect them to be discharged by Tuesday at the latest.' Massimo Casciani, spokesman for the local bishop of Rieti, monsignor Delio Lucarelli, said: 'At some point the bishop will visit the nun but at the moment he has not yet seen here. 'We shall be investigating the circumstances behind - the child could be the fruit of a consensual rapport but it could also have been as a result of violence. That's why we need to investigate properly.'","The 33-year-old woman is nun with order of the Little Disciples of Jesus .

"A man in a wheelchair set off a home-made bomb in the arrivals hall at Beijing Airport today. The man was initially suspected to to have died in the blast in Terminal 3 at around 6.24pm local time, but Chinese state media has now said he survived and was taken to hospital.

Scroll down for video . Explosion: Photographs emerged online in the wake of the blast of a man in a wheelchair waving his arms in the air at Beijing Airport . Panic: Clouds of smoke filled the arrivals hall today after the man set off a home-made bomb in the busy airport . The picture shows a huddled group of people crouching around someone on the floor next to the over-turned wheelchair. The man is thought to have detonated a package of gunpowder used to make firecrackers.

"Samsonite is recalling 250,000 suitcases, including some sold through UK online stores, amid concerns about toxic chemicals. The move follows tests by a consumer group which found traces of a cancer-risk chemical in handles on the luxury bags. The recall relates to the Tokyo Chic brand, which is part of the American Tourister range. Recall: Samsonite products are displayed at a store in Hong Kong where the testing on the Tokyo Chic suitcases that has led to the recall was carried out . In Britain these cases are advertised . by specialist online firms such as bagsdirect.com and luggagehut.co.uk, . rather than high street outlets. Bagsdirect.com was selling a Tokyo . Chic expandable upright trolley case in black pearl print at £64.99 on . its  website yesterday. A spokesman for the firm said Samsonite generally dispatches these and other designs from a large warehouse  in Belgium. Samsonite, a US company, pulled the line from Hong Kong stores earlier this week to replace the side handles. Concern: Testing in Hong Kong, a popular shopping destination, detected the high level of cancer linked compounds . The move came after Hong Kong’s . Consumer Council reported that a  sample it tested had levels of poly- . cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that  were higher than recommended in . voluntary guidelines. The compounds are commonly found in . plastics, rubber and lubricating oil and it is possible that traces were . left during manufacturing, the council said. They have been known to cause cancer . and birth defects in animals. The council’s tests gave readings for the . compounds that were off the charts at 17,960 milligrams per kilo. Samsonite commissioned independent . tests from German and Hong Kong  laboratories that showed levels were . ‘significantly lower’ than the council’s findings. Those tests found 17 . milligrams per kilo of the compound, said Ramesh Tainwala, Samsonite’s . Asia-Pacific and Middle East president. He said: ‘A human being has to eat  100 handles and then you have the probability of one in a billion chance of getting cancer.’ The Tokyo Chic suitcases are sold . mainly in Asia. Samsonite expects to spend £320,000 on the recall, which . involves 250,000 suitcases sold over the past three years. The company said it will take about a week to replace the handles on 30,000 cases still in stock. In Hong Kong, about 800 people have . contacted the company about the suitcases and about 240 have asked for . the handles on their bags to be replaced, Mr Tainwala said. Samsonite said there are no legal . guidelines for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The council used . guidelines  set under a voluntary German scheme for its tests. British consumers who own a Tokyo Chic suitcase are being told that they should contact the retailer it came from for advice.","Hong Kong consumer group found higher than recommended hydrocarbon levels .

"As I run through the official checklist of the things my ten-year-old daughter Sophie needs for Brownie camp, I notice a handwritten postscript added in a flourish at the bottom of the form. ‘Mummy, whatever you buy, just make sure it’s pink!!!!’ I do my best to fulfil the remit. Pink swimming cap? Tick. Pink torch? Tick. Pink hiking boots? Well, that’s a struggle but I find some with pink laces. So, almost tick. Where Sophie is concerned — to misquote U.S. motor manufacturer Henry Ford — she will have any colour… so long as it’s pink. 'Mummy, whatever you buy, just make sure it's pink!!!!' says Sophie, 10, to her mother Angela . Ever since she was old enough to point an autocratic finger at her colour of choice, that little digit has always swung to the most feminine end of the palette. On planet Sophie, the world is one unapologetic riot of pink, from the rose-coloured bows she clamps in her hair to her favourite strawberry ice cream. Yet, if right-on ‘experts’ are to be believed, by allowing my daughter to succumb to her love of pink, I could be boxing in her ambition, damaging her prospects and condemning her to a life chained to the kitchen sink. Only the other week, Hannah Webster from the Independent Association of Prep Schools warned that having blue for a boy and pink for a girl is ‘pernicious’ because it leads them towards certain roles. In the biggest pile of Lefty hokum, she wrote: ‘If we designate a particular colour to a gender, it leads us to designate all manner of other things by gender, too. The result is girls and boys read different kinds of books, play with different kinds of toys, study different subjects, consider different occupations, have different roles within the workplace and family, and are ultimately valued differently by society.’ On planet Sophie, the world is one unapologetic riot of pink, from rose-coloured bows to strawberry ice cream . Clearly, she has never met my daughter — a steel-willed, focused and determined young lady, whose choice of pink is a robust and frank expression of her own ideas and identity. Ironically, there was every likelihood Sophie would become a tomboy — arriving as she did after three brothers. Yet despite the prevailing toilet humour and boys-will-be-boys influences in our house, her love of pink has remained steadfast. This then is nature, not nurture, leaking from within to literally colour every choice she makes. And why shouldn’t it? She’s a girl, for goodness’ sake. Does giving in to her feminine instincts somehow mean she won’t be encouraged — as I have done with her older siblings — to aim high, work hard and set her cap at a professional career? Of course not. She only has to look to her mother, working as a writer and broadcaster, to see how much I believe in women having strong careers. Nature not nurture: Sophie's love of pink doesn't stop her aiming high like her mother . More girls than boys go to university. Yet people keep insisting that pink stymies girls' development. Webster isn’t the only one to peddle the lazy, oven-ready view that girls playing with pink dollies and boys ramming footballs into a net is somehow offensive to the evolution of the modern child. Marks & Spencer has now pledged to make toys ‘gender neutral’ (despite happily taking thousands of pounds from me over the years for Sophie’s frilly pinafores). The word pink was first used to describe the colour in the late 17th century - its name comes from a pale-red flower. In a recent parliamentary debate, MPs Jenny Willott, Elizabeth Truss and Chi Onwurah fretted over the ‘pinkification’ of toys for girls, maintaining it was adding to gender inequality in science, technology, engineering and maths careers. Yet Melbourne academic Cordelia Fine, writing recently in the New Scientist, admits ‘there is no research linking gendered marketing of toys and books and later occupational discrimination or sharing of household chores.’ So why do so many people persist in peddling such inane views? Why can’t little girls be left to be little girls? We live in an age when more girls than boys go to university, when our medical schools churn out more female than male doctors. Yet we still have these deeply misguided voices who — like forcing left-handed children to pick up pencils in their right — keep insisting that pink stymies girls’ development. If Sophie wants pink, she can have pink — in fact, I’m proud to say, I wouldn’t be able to stop her, since her will and determination are unapologetic and immovable. If Sophie wants pink, she can have pink, and Angela's proud to say she wouldn't be able to stop her . Once again modern feminism has shot itself in the foot. By spoiling for fights where they don’t exist and failing to acknowledge that biology doesn’t make us unequal, just different, today’s ‘pro-wimmin’ lobby squashes my daughter’s voice. If the blinkered anti-pink campaigners think neutralising a love of this colour is the way to greater equality and career satisfaction, they need to drop those rose-tinted glasses. Or whatever colour they choose to wear.","Daughter Sophie, 10, only wants pink things .

"Dr. William Petit seemed to have the world on his side as he headed down the aisle with new love Christine Paluf, five years after he was the lone survivor of the brutal home invasion that left his wife and daughters dead. Moving photographs from the day capture the newlyweds' laughter as leave the Connecticut church as man and wife, and the . tender moment Paluf leaned up to her new husband for . a kiss. In a touching show of support, Dr Petit's former father-in-law Rev. Richard Hawke said his daughter would want her widowed husband to have someone like Ms Paluf in his life. He added that he hopes the couple, who met while working for a foundation set up in the family's memory, go on to have children. Dr William Petit headed down the aisle with new love Christine Paluf last August, five years after he was the lone survivor of the brutal home invasion that left his wife and daughters dead . Rev. Hawke wrote a blessing that was read at the wedding in West Hartford, Connecticut on Sunday. 'My theme for the prayer was this is the day for new beginnings,' he told the New York Daily News. 'After having come through the home . invasion and the death of his entire family ... this marriage was a time . for new beginnings.' In the blessing, he mentioned each of the victims of the brutal attack in 2007 - Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and the couple's daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old . Michaela. 'I said I can hear Jennifer giving her blessing and love to William and Christine,' he told People Magazine. 'I said about Hayley – who was this sports [fan] in the family and also a very good student – I had her saying, ""Way to go, Dad!""' 'And from Michaela I had her saying, ""Don’t forget us, Dad"",' he continued. '""[And] if you have more children, and we hope you will, just love them as much as you have us and you will all be OK.""' Rev. Hawke, who said he has known Paluf for a year, went on: 'My . wife and I hope that they have children, and that they would love those . children just as much as [Petit] loved his other children.' After their emotional wedding ceremony last year, which they shared with 300 family and friends, William and Christine moved into a new home on Farmington River in western Connecticut . Throughout his sorrow and his grief, Christine has been a constant. Always being by his side to hold his hand and pull him through . The wedding between Dr. Petit, 55, and photographer Paluf, 34, was witnessed by 300 friends and family on Sunday. They began dating last year after working together at the Petit Family Foundation and became engaged in December. Dr Petit, a diabetes specialist, gave . up practicing medicine after the death of his wife and children and . decided to devote his life to fighting . for justice for them through the foundation. In 2008, he met Paluf at a local . country club, where she worked as a marketing director, and she offered . her professional photography services to the charity. 'It was fun,' Hayley Hovhanessian from the Petit Foundation told ABC News after the wedding, adding that the couple had planned on a honeymoon but she is 'not sure where'. Marybelle Hawke, the mother of Dr Petit's deceased wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit, said her family welcomed the engagement and encouraged Petit to find peace and joy in his life. Dr Petit with his wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters, Hayley (left) and Michaela . Blessing: Rev. Richard Hawke (left), the father of Petit's murdered wife, has given his support to the marriage. Hawke and Petit are pictured with his sister Johanna Chapman outside court last year . Hawke-Petit's sister was among the . wedding guests. 'Our family needed this to help us heal,' Cindy Hawke-Renn told People. 'Making . sure that he is going to move forward and have love in his life and . have some joy is something that makes us feel better. It’s like a piece . of our healing. We all really like Christine.' After the engagement in December, Hawke-Renn said: 'This is something we'd hoped and prayed . for, that Billy would one day find love again. He's happier and more joyful, . lighter.' The happy day comes five . years since the horrific killings of Dr. Petit's family at the hands of . two house invaders, Joshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes. They are on death row for the . murders of Mrs Hawke-Petit, 48, and the couple's daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old . Michaela. New-found happiness: Dr William Petit, the lone survivor of a brutal home invasion in Connecticut, has married photographer Christine Paluf. His wife and two daughters died in the attack in 2007 . Support: The family of Petit's deceased wife have wished him and Paluf the world of happiness . Together: The couple were joined by 300 friends and relatives at the wedding in West Hartford on Sunday . Mrs Hawke-Petit was raped and strangled while her children were tied to their beds and left to die when the house was set on fire. Dr Petit was beaten with a baseball bat and tied up in the basement, but managed to escape by crawling to a neighbour's house. Paluf attended the trials for the killers of Petit's family. Both Komisarjevsky and Hayes were convicted and are currently on Connecticut's death row, waiting to be put to death by lethal injection. 'There is never complete closure when . you lose your wife and family, but the first part is over and we think . justice has been served,' Petit said last December. He also spoke of his devastation and how he had contemplated suicide after he was left with a 'jagged hole in my heart'. 'I miss my entire family, my home, . everything we had together,' he said. 'They were three special people. I . lost my entire family. I lost the records of our shared lives together . due to the fire.' Killers: Joshua Komisarjevsky, left, and Steven Hayes, right, were convicted of raping Mrs Hawke-Petit and murdering her and her two daughters. They have both been sentenced to death . In March . 2011, Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy signed a new law that ends the . state's death penalty for future crimes, but it does not apply to those . already on death row. Many had insisted that the death penalty remain for previous cases so that Komisarjevsky and Hayes would not be spared. Earlier this year it emerged that Steven Hayes came up with a bizarre plan to end his own life by lying in a series of letters that he had killed 17 other victims and raped dozens of women. However, he later claimed in an interview that he had 'made it all up' and that he had hoped the letters would lead prison authorities to notify police and he could trade information for food. He planned to use the ploy to eat oysters in his cell to which he is deathly allergic.","Dr William Petit married Christine Paluf on Sunday in West Hartford .

"Betty Teague, 85, of Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, has been banned for a year for drink-driving . Pensioner Betty Teague is believed to be the oldest female drink driver in the country after she was banned from the roads for a year. Teague, 85, of Shoreham, East Sussex, was pulled over by police officers who found her driving slowly along the A27 with no lights on April 3. She failed a breath test which revealed she had 100 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - above the legal limit of 80. Teague pleaded guilty to drink-driving at Brighton Magistrates Court. She was fined £73, ordered to pay victim surcharge of £20, court costs of £85, as well as being banned from driving for a year.

"President Barack Obama sided with open-Internet activists on Monday, urging the Federal Communications . Commission to draft new rules that would reclassify the broadband net to . regulate it more like a public utility. The end result would tie the hands of Internet service providers that want to cut special deals with services like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and Amazon to push their streaming content along a 'fast lane' that ordinary Americans can't access. The FCC has been working on the new rule for seven months, and has received nearly 4 million comments from the public. Its first attempt at a 'net neutrality' rule met with the judicial axe in January with a federal court sided with Verizon and ruled that the government agency lacks the legal authority to control how Internet companies set their prices. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama announced a full-court press Monday on 'net neutrality,' a policy that would prohibit Internet service providers from playing favorites as they allocate resources online . REBRANDING: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is already framing Net Neutrality in a way that connects it to the president's increasingly unpopular medical insurance overhaul . Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a framework this year that prohibited Internet . service providers like Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner Cable from blocking any content, but allowed deals . where content providers would pay ISPs to ensure smooth delivery . of traffic. Wheeler said in April that his FCC would propose that 'broadband providers would be required to offer a baseline level of service to their subscribers, along with the ability to enter into individual negotiations with content providers.' 'In all instances, broadband providers would need to act in a commercially reasonable manner subject to review on a case-by-case basis.' Obama campaigned on the issue of net neutrality. He said in a statement Monday that the FCC's new rules should explicitly ban any paid . prioritization deals. 'Simply put: No service should be stuck in a 'slow lane' because it does not pay a fee,' Obama said. 'That kind of gatekeeping would . undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet's . growth.' 'I believe the FCC should create a new set of rules . protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable . company nor the phone company will be able to act as a . gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online.' He also said the FCC should apply its new rules equally to . mobile and wired ISPs. Two GOP senators pushed back – hard. Net neutrality 'puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities, and higher prices for consumers,' Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz wrote on Facebook. '""Net Neutrality"" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government,' he added on Twitter. South Dakota GOP Sen. John Thune said Obama's vision relied on 'rules written nearly 80 years ago for plain old telephone service.' 'The president’s stale thinking would invite legal and marketplace uncertainty and perpetuate what has needlessly become a politically corrosive policy debate.' The move Obama seeks would rely on Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, a law that never contemplated life in the Internet age. MEANWHILE, 13 TIME ZONES AWAY: Obama avoided questions about his Net Neutrality position by having the White House release a statement while he was in China . The National Cable and Telecommunications Association, a trade group that represents broadband providers, said it was 'stunned the president would abandon the longstanding, bipartisan policy of lightly regulating the Internet and calling for extreme Title II regulation.' In taking a position in favor of net neutrality, Obama is siding with liberal activist groups that want the FCC to put ISPs in a new category so that they can be . regulated more like public utilities. One such group, CREDO, is a self-described 'progressive mobile phone provider' that operates more like a nonprofit than an ISP. 'This is huge,' CREDO political director Becky Bond said Monday in a statement. 'President Obama just proved whose side he is on – that of the American people and an open and equal Internet.' 'Obama’s statement is simply a cynical political ploy, a way of playing to activists on the radical Left who have built mailing lists and a political movement on the most absolutist conception of net neutrality,' the libertarian think tank TechFreedom said in a statement. 'There is no dispute about the propriety of transparency rules and bans on discrimination and blocking. But this tectonic shift in national policy, should it be adopted, would create devastating results.' Obama waited to announce his position until after the midterm election. The White House emailed the news to reporters while the president was in China for a Trans-Pacific Partnership meeting. 'An open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life. By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known. '""Net neutrality"" has been built into the fabric of the Internet since its creation – but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted. We cannot allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas. That is why today, I am asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to answer the call of almost 4 million public comments, and implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality. 'When I was a candidate for this office, I made clear my commitment to a free and open Internet, and my commitment remains as strong as ever. Four years ago, the FCC tried to implement rules that would protect net neutrality with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies that make important investments in our economy. After the rules were challenged, the court reviewing the rules agreed with the FCC that net neutrality was essential for preserving an environment that encourages new investment in the network, new online services and content, and everything else that makes up the Internet as we now know it. Unfortunately, the court ultimately struck down the rules – not because it disagreed with the need to protect net neutrality, but because it believed the FCC had taken the wrong legal approach. 'The FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone. I believe the FCC should create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online. The rules I am asking for are simple, common-sense steps that reflect the Internet you and I use every day, and that some ISPs already observe. These bright-line rules include: . 'If carefully designed, these rules should not create any undue burden for ISPs, and can have clear, monitored exceptions for reasonable network management and for specialized services such as dedicated, mission-critical networks serving a hospital. But combined, these rules mean everything for preserving the Internet’s openness. 'The rules also have to reflect the way people use the Internet today, which increasingly means on a mobile device. I believe the FCC should make these rules fully applicable to mobile broadband as well, while recognizing the special challenges that come with managing wireless networks. 'To be current, these rules must also build on the lessons of the past. For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business. That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one, and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider. It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information – whether a phone call, or a packet of data. 'So the time has come for the FCC to recognize that broadband service is of the same importance and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do. To do that, I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act – while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services. This is a basic acknowledgment of the services ISPs provide to American homes and businesses, and the straightforward obligations necessary to ensure the network works for everyone – not just one or two companies. 'Investment in wired and wireless networks has supported jobs and made America the center of a vibrant ecosystem of digital devices, apps, and platforms that fuel growth and expand opportunity. Importantly, network investment remained strong under the previous net neutrality regime, before it was struck down by the court; in fact, the court agreed that protecting net neutrality helps foster more investment and innovation. If the FCC appropriately forbears from the Title II regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above – principles that most ISPs have followed for years – it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the Internet. 'The Internet has been one of the greatest gifts our economy – and our society – has ever known. The FCC was chartered to promote competition, innovation, and investment in our networks. In service of that mission, there is no higher calling than protecting an open, accessible, and free Internet. I thank the Commissioners for having served this cause with distinction and integrity, and I respectfully ask them to adopt the policies I have outlined here, to preserve this technology’s promise for today, and future generations to come.'","Cruz: 'The Internet should not operate at the speed of government.'

"The Academy Awards have been accused of being stuffy and boring but Ellen DeGeneres was determined to bring them up to date on Sunday. The chat show host and prolific tweeter took what is being described as the 'best selfie ever' during her hosting duties, a picture which started off as just her and Meryl Streep but soon expanded to include Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Spacey in a picture taken by Bradley Cooper. Multi-tasking Ellen then shared the snap on her Twitter page, where it broke the record for most retweets, with 1,076,971 in less than an hour as social media fans went wild for the snap, while continuing to host the show. However, it did appear as if the picture was part of a promotional stunt for Samsung, which is a big sponsor of the show, as the selfie was taken with her Samsung Galaxy Note 3, a device which she whipped out at various stages during the proceedings. Scroll down for video . The selfie that broke Twitter: Ellen DeGeneres' selfie with stars Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Meryl Streep (using her Oscars sponsor Samsung Galaxy phone) crashed the social networking site after it was retweeted 2 million times . It was just one in a series of fun moments as Ellen won over the celebrity crowd at the Academy Awards with some gentle teasing but one person was less than impressed. While Jennifer took jokes about falling over on the red carpet in her stride and Jared Leto laughed as Ellen dubbed him 'the prettiest of them all', Liza Minnelli looked less than impressed when Ellen quipped she thought she was a male impersonator. Taking to the stage at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre, seven years after she last presented, Ellen joked: 'The real Captain Philips is here tonight . and the real Philomena and one of the most impressive Liza Minnelli . impersonators I've ever seen in my entire life. Good job sir. That is . seriously impressive.' Get it together; Ellen worked to get all of the celebrities together for the sot and they were all eager to get involved . Group hug: The entire group huddled up close as they all tried to get themselves into the picture on the phone . What about me? Poor Liza was too short to make it into the epic selfie . While the audience and Liza's sister . Lorna Luft howled with laughter, Liza looked less than amused and merely . cracked a small smile. Apart from a less than warm reception from Minnelli, DeGeneres won over the A-list crowd with her gentle opening monologue. She opened with a quip about the recent rain in Hollywood and the inability of everyone to cope with it: 'For those of you . watching around the world, it has been a tough couple of  days for us, . it's been raining. We're fine. Thank you for your prayers.' She also gently ribbed the academy for not deviating very much in their voting patterns. Most star-studded selfie ever? Stars including Jared Leto, Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Street along with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie got involved int he snap taken by Bradley Cooper . Ellen joked: 'Things . are so different now. For example last time I was here Leonardo . DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese were . nominated. Soooo different.' She . teased 84-year-old nominee June Squibb about her age, saying: 'There . are some first time nominees here – June Squibb is nominated for . Nebraska. At 84 years old she is the oldest nominee. [To June] I'm . telling everyone that you were in Nebraska.' And Hollywood's obsession with youth was also called out, with the tuxedo clad host saying: 'Tonight's theme is Heroes in Hollywood and we need heroes more than ever. 'I'm not saying movies are the most important thing in the world but we all know that the most important thing is youth. Sponsored tweet? Ellen took the selfie with her Samsung phone, and the company is a big sponsor of the Oscars . We're down: Twitter crashed during the broadcast after Ellen's tweet went viral . 'I'm kidding, the most important thing is love, family and friendship and if people don’t have that they get into showbiz.' Ellen then suggested that maybe she was the biggest winner of the night. 'You should think of yourself as . winners,' she said. 'Not all of you but those who have won before. And I . know what you're thinking. ""Ellen you've been chosen as host and that's . the highest award there is"". Thank you.' While the nominees are all successful in their field, the host pointed out the lack of education among them: Between all of the nominees here you've made 1,400 films and attended six years of college.' Working out the logistics: Everyone scrambled to try to figure out how best to put the picture together as a fascinated audience looked on . 'I've got this!' Bradley took charge and made sure he got the perfect picture at the Oscars . She then picked one nominee out of of . the crowd: 'Amy Adams you went to college right? What no? OK. Well . you're amazing actress and you're in not one but two nominated films . tonight and that is so, what is the word for this, selfish.' She . also pleaded with the academy to stop nominating Meryl Streep, saying . the star could no longer afford all of the gowns and make-up which are . needed for awards season. It's been an exceptional year for . movies, one of the nominees is Her, and by Her I mean Meryl Streep,' Ellen joked. 'Meryl has been nominated for an Oscar a total of 18 times. 'It sounds good but if you do the . math between dresses, hair and make-up, that's hundreds of thousands of . dollars. Simply put Meryl cannot afford to be nominated again.' Still not forgiven? Liza still did not look happy even though she clutched on to Ellen's arm for a picture . She . compared the Oscars to the Hunger Games and brought up Jennifer . Lawrence falling on her way to the stage last year to accept her award. 'Who are we kidding? It’s The Hunger Games. There are cameras . everywhere, you’re starving, Jennifer Lawrence won last year…Jennifer . I am not going to bring up what happened last year when you fell...' Ellen began. 'For . those who don’t know when Jennifer won last year she tripped on the way . up. And when you fell getting out of the car tonight – no one needs to know that. 'But if you win tonight I think we should bring you the Oscar, I don’t wanna risk it.' And . Jared Leto didn't escape the gentle teasing, with Ellen quipping: 'Win . or lose you look beautiful. 'Cate you look beautiful and Sandy but let’s . be honest Jared Leto is the most beautiful of all. He’s the prettiest. Boy is he pretty. Matthew McConaughey is also pretty but a rugged dirty pretty.' Ellen continued: Both are nominated . for Dallas Buyers Club. It deals with the serious issue of people who . have sex at the Rodeos. It looks good but don't do it.' 'Good job sir!' Liza Minnelli was less than impressed when Ellen jokingly mistook her for a male impersonator . At least someone finds it funny: Liza's sister Lorna Luft broke into howls of laughter at the quip . And that was her segue into a joke about actor Bruce Dern. 'Speaking of sex at the rodeos, Bruce . Dern is here,' Ellen said to a chorus of laughter, especially from the . actor's daughter Laura Dern. 'A bit of background on Bruce, his . grandfather was the governor of Utah, his granduncle was a Pulitzer . prize winning poet and his godmother was Eleanor Roosevelt... and here . you are among us tonight. What went wrong?' Pizza for everyone: Ellen handed out pizza to the assembled stars before trying to get them to chip in . Keep some for me: Brad Pitt jumped up to grab some pizza from the deliveryman from Big Mamas and Papas pizzas . Jonah Hill was next in the firing line . when the comedian brought up his memorable scene in Wolf Of Wall Street . where his character exposes his private parts at a pool party. She said: 'Jonah Hill is nominated for . his amazing performance in Wolf Of Wall Street. You showed us something . in that film which I haven't seen for a very very long time.' She finished with a rather poignant . joke about how the ceremony could end:'Anything can happen. Possibility . one, 12 Years A Slave wins the Best Picture. 'Possibility number two, you're all racists.' Digging in: Both Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts dug in to the delicious pies from the comapny . She can take some gentle teasing: Jennifer roared with laughter as Ellen poked fun at her for falling both last year and this year . Later, Ellen had the entire auditorium in fits of laughter as she ordered pizza for everyone. Brad . Pitt, Jared Leto and Martin Scorsese all reached for a slice, delivered . by a pizza man from Big Mamas pizza place on Sunset Boulevard. Ellen tried . to get well known faces including Harvey Weinstein to chip in for the . food, joking that there was no pressure but the show was being beamed . live to a huge audience who would judge him for not giving money. Hilarious: Ellen kept Julia Roberts laughing with her quips during the evening . Winning everyone over: Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother Irmelin, Jonah Hill and Martin Scorsese couldn't stop laughing at Ellen's jokes . So far the reviews of Degeneres' hosting have been good with Variety's TV columnist Brian Lowry saying . her opening monologue 'screamed of a desire to dial back the show to . safer terrain.' This refers to last year's host, Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane's risque . approach to the show, which included jokes about gays, Jews and a song aimed . actresses who have gone nude in movies called 'We Saw Your Boobs'. The Washington Post continued the praise for Ellen, stating that the comedienne 'told . jokes that were easy on the ears, gentle on the mind and, for the most . part, sparingly nice.' The . Interview With A Vampire author, Anne Rice, said: 'Well, it's over.  And . I think Ellen did a superb job as the host for the Oscars.'One . person who certainly wasn't enjoying the show was Donald Tump, who . spent the evening mocking Ellen and the production: 'I should host the . #Oscars just to shake things up - this is not good!'

Today, Mr Harris attended court with his daughter Bindi, wife Alwen and niece Jenny as the victim was cross-examined on her sexual abuse claims. The woman allegedly sexually abused by Rolf Harris as a teenager demanded £25,000 or her brother would go to the newspapers following their affair, the jury heard. The woman, who is now in her 40s, claims to have written to the entertainer in 1994 to ask for the money because she wanted to set up a bird sanctuary with her then boyfriend. But Southwark Crown Court heard that when Harris told her he could not afford to pay the money she was requesting, the woman responded with a warning that he should 'keep an eye on the papers'. After two days in the witness box, the alleged victim has now finished giving evidence. Harris is accused of using his celebrity status to 'brazenly' abuse four girls aged between seven or eight and 19 between 1968 and 1986. The cartoonist has previous admitted having an affair with the woman giving evidence today, but insists it was consensual and denies any sexual contact while she was underage. Harris, from Bray in Berkshire, denies a total of 12 counts of indecent assault. The trial continues.

'Utter farce': Journalists have taken to Twitter to lambast the hilarious conditions of their hotels in Sochi . Journalists checking in were left stunned as they arrived for bookings made last summer to be told they would have to wait indefinitely. The few that did get rooms, were met with stray dogs, half-built walls, and toxic yellow water spitting from the sinks. One hotel lobby had no floor - but staff had found time to hang a framed photo of Vladimir Putin. Mark MacKinnon tweeted: 'For those of you wondering, when's there's no lobby in your hotel, you go to the owner's bedroom to check in.' Another guesthouse warned toilet users not to flush loo roll but instead put it in the plastic bin by the door. One reporter was told to wait a day for their room, which had no running water, no internet - and no door to access it. Nearby, hotel managers advised guests not to splash water on their faces as it 'contains something dangerous'. Having book 11 rooms five months ago, CNN's team were told to share one. The shocking images and anecdotes comes after it emerged Russia exceeded its budget by millions to spend $32billion on the games. Russia insists widespread fears for human rights are unfounded despite a video by Human Rights Watch incorporating clips from some of the worst examples of homophobic violence in Russia which has been filmed and uploaded to the internet. However, Vladimir Putin has sanctioned action to be taken on the city's large population of stray dogs. In a bid to make the area presentable to welcome in people from around the world, the animals are being fed poison on the streets and left to die. The strategy has outraged animal rights activists - and baffled journalists arriving in Sochi today who claim the city is brimming with ailing dogs. Meanwhile, a top U.S. counterterrorist official says there are 'a number of specific threats' aimed at the Winter Olympics that start this week in Sochi, Russia - with the greatest danger coming from the Caucasus Emirate, which has threatened to attack the games. Russia has mounted a massive security operation for the Olympics, deploying more than 50,000 police and soldiers amid threats from Muslim insurgents.","Journalists checking in at hotel bookings made last summer left shocked .

"Two pensioners have tied the knot after being sent on a blind date by the funeral director who arranged their spouses' funerals. Tom Lennon, 76, and his now wife Isabell, 70, from Wickford, Essex, worked with undertaker Lynne Love after she helped arranged the funerals of their respective partners Alice and Bob. After the funerals, Ms Love, who works at The Co-operative Funeralcare, stayed in touch with the pair and would sometimes meet them for a cup of tea. Tom Lennon, 76, and his wife Isabell, 70, from Wickford, Essex, went on a . blind date in January after being set up by the funeral director who had arranged their spouses' funerals . Six months later after being set up by Lynne Love, 54, pictured centre, the pair tied the knot. Ms Love took the action after both former clients said they felt lonely . But when the pair both complained about being lonely,  the 54-year-old wanted to do something about it. She realised that they would be the perfect match - and decided to set the pair up on a date. Just six months after meeting in January, Mr and Mrs Lennon were married at Brentwood registry office - with Ms Love as their witness. She said: 'I had the great honour of attending the wedding and being a witness. I'm not the mushiest person but I cried all the way through. 'I think if I died tomorrow, this would be my greatest achievement.' The pair met for the first time after Ms Love gave Mr Lennon, whose wife died in May last year, his future wife's number. Mr and Mrs Lennon married on June 20 at Brentwood registry office, . pictured above, with Ms Love as their witness . Mr Lennon, a retired mortuary worker and . caretaker, said: 'Loneliness is a terrible thing. If it hadn't been for . Lynne I would never have met Isabell and realised that people like her . existed. 'I plucked up the courage to ring her after Lynne gave me her number and we just clicked - we haven't looked back since. Mr Lennon met Ms Love after having to arrange the funeral of his wife Alice, pictured, in May last year . 'Isabell is the best thing that's ever happened to me and I'm as happy as a sandboy. She's 100% diamond and her family have made me feel so welcome.' Mrs Lennon, who husband died in 2011, added: 'I have found my soul mate. He is the most kind and caring man and I have laughed constantly since we met. 'Our families are delighted for us both to have found such happiness in later life.' The retired nurse, who is a mother of two and grandmother of six, added: 'Lynne became a good friend due to bereavement on both our parts. 'She stopped me one day and said she knew a nice man who was looking for a bit of company and could she give him my number. 'I agreed and we arranged to go for a drink that evening at the local pub. The next night we had a meal together and the relationship just blossomed from there. 'Our wedding day was a beautiful occasion - my two daughters helped to organise it and we had a lovely day with family and friends. 'I am just so happy we found each other. It's not often you find love through a funeral director.' Mrs Lennon, right, said she has found her soul mate, while Mr Lennon, left, said his wife is the best thing that has ever happened to him . Ms Love said: 'I always keep in touch with customers as it's nice to have a cup of tea and a chat with a friendly face. 'After chatting with Isabell one day, it came to mind that the pair of them would be very well suited. 'It is great that they have both been able to find happiness again and it has given them a new lease of life. 'With the job I do comes a lot of sadness but it is nice something good can come out of it.'","Tom Lennon, 76, arranged his wife's funeral using undertaker Lynne Love, 54 .

"The Malibu-based playboy son of an African dictator is being forced to surrender more than $30million worth of his assets after allegedly stealing money from his own country. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of the Equatorial Guinea president, must sell his mansion in California, his Ferrari and most of his Michael Jackson memorabilia under the settlement. However, he will be able to keep the singer's famous crystal-encrusted 'Bad Tour' glove, a jacket used during the 'Thriller' tour and a $38.5million Gulfstream jet, as they remain outside the U.S. Playboy: Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue (above), the son of Equatorial Guinea president, must sell his Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and his Michael Jackson memorabilia under a settlement with the U.S Government . Prized possession: However, he will be able to keep the singer's famous crystal-encrusted 'Bad Tour' glove (above), a jacket used during the 'Thriller' tour and a Gulfstream jet, as they remain outside America . Famous glove: Mangue reportedly paid $482,000 for Michael Jackson's 'Bad Tour' glove - which is white and covered in crystals - in the late 1980s. The late singer (pictured) wore it during his first concert . Instead, the 42-year-old must pay a further $1million to cover the value of the memorabilia elsewhere, Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, of the Department of Justice (DOJ), said. In addition to this, if these items ever re-enter America, they will be subject to seizure by the U.S. Government, officials told ABC. Mangue, the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, reportedly forked out $482,000 for Michael Jackson's glove - which is white and adorned with crystals - in the late 1980s. The singer, who died in June 2009, wore it during his first ever concert, 'Bad Tour', which was launched in support of his seventh studio album of the same name. For Mangue, the glove was a prized addition to his $3.2million collection of Jackson memorabilia, which he owned alongside his $30million mansion and $530,000 Ferrari. The settlement, announced by the DOJ last Friday, will see Mangue turn over around $20million from the sale of his assets to a charitable organization for the benefit of the people of his country. Mansion: The settlement, announced by the DOJ last Friday, will see Mangue turn over $20million from the sale of his assets (including his mansion - above - in Malibu, California) to a charitable organization . Interior: The son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema will also have to forfeit another $10.3 million to the U.S. Government, to be used to benefit Equatorial Guinea's people. Above, the mansion's interior . Life's a beach: Despite recent oil and gas wealth in Equatorial Guinea, most of the 750,000 people in the coastal country live in poverty. However, American-educated Mangue lived in a luxurious mansion in Malibu . Contrast: Since the economic boom, U.S. officials said Mangue and others in Equatorial Guinea (pictured) have amassed a vast amount of wealth through extortion, embezzlement and other acts of corruption . He will also have to forfeit another $10.3 million to the U.S. Government, which will be used to benefit Equatorial Guinea's people to the extent permitted by law. Thomas Winkowski, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the settlement would be 'gratifying' for the many investigators and prosecutors who worked 'tirelessly' on the case. But he added: 'It is undoubtedly even more rewarding for the people of Equatorial Guinea, knowing that at least some of the money plundered from their country's coffers is being returned to them.' Priceless purchase: Mangue (left) reportedly paid $482,000 for Michael Jackson's 'Bad Tour' glove (right) Defense: Mangue (pictured), who is  also Equatorial Guinea's second vice president, said in a statement that he was pleased to put an end to the proceedings. But he claimed his property was acquired legally . Despite recent oil and gas wealth in Equatorial Guinea, most of the 750,000 people in the coastal country live in poverty. Since the economic boom, U.S. authorities said Mangue and other officials have amassed a vast amount of wealth through extortion, embezzlement and other acts of corruption. No-one was immediately available to comment on the settlement at the Equatorial Guinea Embassy. Life of luxury: In 2011, U.S. authorities filed civil-forfeiture cases alleging Mangue (left) spent $70million in looted profits on the mansion, the jet and Jackson memorabilia. Right, an inspector looks at his Ferrari . Jet: In addition to Jackson's glove and  jacket, Mangue will be able to keep his Gulfstream jet (file picture) Mangue, who is American-educated and also Equatorial Guinea's second vice president, said in a statement that he was pleased to put an end to the proceedings. However, he claimed his property 'was acquired with funds earned in accordance with the laws of my country and through business dealings inside and outside Equatorial Guinea'. He added that he hoped the settlement would help improve the relationship between his country and the United States. Search: Federal agents are pictured opening crates of art objects and collectibles at American-educated Mangue's mansion in Malibu, California, in October 2011 during the execution of a search warrant . Meeting: President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and his wife are seen with the Obamas in August this year . 'For the good of my country, it was important to resolve this matter and put the relationship back on firm footing,' he said. In 2011, U.S. authorities filed civil-forfeiture cases alleging  Mangue spent $70million in looted profits on the mansion - which has a nine-hole golf course - the jet and the Jackson memorabilia. Rapper: In 2010, it was reported that Mangue was dating the rapper and actress Eve, spending close to $700,000 to rent Paul Allen's yacht to impress her . Authorities said his official government salary was less than $100,000, and he used his position and influence to garner more than $300 million through corruption and money laundering. In 2010, it was reported that Mangue was dating the rapper and actress Eve, spending close to $700,000 to rent Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen's 303-foot yacht Tatoosh to impress her, according to the New York Post. A friend of Eve told the  tabloid that he had been chasing her for a long time and that she finally gave in to his invitation. The Grammy award winner was reportedly named in the ongoing investigation into Mangue and foreign corruption. Eve used her Twitter account to deny the allegations and urged her fans not to believe everything they read. Mangue still is the subject of lawsuits in France and Spain. French financial prosecutors in March filed preliminary charges of alleged money-laundering connected to real estate, luxury cars, art and other property in France. It is part of a larger suit involving properties owned by leaders of Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Republic of Congo. In 2009, prosecutors in Spain opened an official investigation into alleged money-laundering by President Nguema and his family into bank transfers and the purchase of luxury properties in Madrid, Gijon and the Canary Islands. Equatorial Guinea was a relatively ignored place until American energy company Exxon Mobil discovered oil and gas there in 1994. U.S. companies continue to dominate the industry there but face growing competition. Most oil from the country, which produces billions of dollars in annual revenue, is exported to America. Despite its newfound wealth, life for the vast majority of the country's 750,000 people remains a struggle.

"Are you ready for one of the least likely fashion hits of summer? Earlier this week, High Street fashion chain New Look announced that it has been selling 40,000 kimonos a week, beating other summer trends printed trousers and maxi dresses into second and third place. Linda wearing a kimono in the Seventies . The Japanese-influenced cover-up took off earlier this year as festival fashion, worn with fringing, cut-off denims and cowboy boots for a look that’s more boho than Edo. Edo was the period in Japan from 1615 when the art of kimono-making was at its height and wives of wealthy merchants entered fashion contests to outdo each other with dazzling designs. Now they’re everywhere from M&S to House of Fraser and Zara. I have a nostalgic affection for the kimono, and had a beautiful black ankle-length one (left) with red and gold embroidery I wore as a dressing gown in the Seventies until it started to unravel. Then there was the simple cotton version  that I wore for several summers over flared  jeans. But when Boy George adopted the kimono as his signature style in the Eighties, I decided their time was up. Until now. The kimono, far from just being festival fashion for Kate Moss wannabes, has a lot to offer. Bingo wings and lumps and bumps are instantly concealed. As a beach cover-up you can slip it over a swimsuit far more  discreetly than a kaftan that needs to be pulled indecorously over your head. A short kimono is the perfect summer cardigan replacement and rather less old ladyish. And if you feel swamped by too much bulk, you can cinch your kimono with a belt. To find out if I can still cut it in a kimono at 62, I put seven High Street styles to the test . . . Scroll down for video .

"His alarm goes off at 3.30am, then it’s just a matter of the 181-mile drive to work. Gary Egan is at his desk by 6.30am each morning, works up to 12 hours a day – then faces the three-hour evening trek home in his Renault Clio. His commute, one of the longest in Britain, sees him travel nearly 100,000 miles a year, equivalent to going four times around the Earth. Gary Egan clocks up 100,000 miles a year with a daily six hour round-trip from his home in Porthcawl, South Wales, to his workplace in Watford, Hertfordshire . The round trip between home in Porthcawl, South Wales, and his office in Watford costs about £15,000 a year. This includes £900 a month on diesel and £6.40 a day in toll fees to cross the Severn Bridge. The father of two admits the journey, which he does five days a week as head of production for a graphics company, is gruelling. But . Mr Egan insists it is worth it because he and his partner Sarah can . enjoy a better quality of life in Porthcawl than if they lived nearer to . Watford. Mr Egan has to set his alarm for 3.30am every day before setting off on the six hour round trip in his Renault Clio . Mr Egan clocks up more than 100,000 miles a year with this 366 mile round-trip to and from work . Yesterday the . 46-year-old, who would only give his salary as ‘more than £35,000 a . year’, said: ‘The industry I work in is quite narrow and there just . aren’t the same job opportunities in Wales for me. ‘I . can’t say it wouldn’t be nice  to get a job that was closer to  home, . but at the moment that is just not possible and I am very happy where I . am.’ His partner Sarah has a ‘very important and stressful job with South Wales Police’, he added. It is not just the free time Gary Egan is forced to sacrifice with his gruelling six-hour commute every day. Overall the commute sets the father-of-two back an estimated £15,000 a year. Mr Egan says he pays £900-a-month on diesel while he also forks out more than £1,600 on toll fees. On top of this of course Mr Egan, a regular customer at his local garage, has to pay his insurance, MOT and servicing costs. ‘We . have discussed the options  for a move, but we feel that our  quality . of life is much better here than it would be closer to my workplace,’ he . said. ‘I like to run and on a weekend within five minutes of leaving my . front door, I’m running along the beach. Everyone is so friendly here, . there’s a real community spirit where neighbours genuinely want to . help.’ Before moving to . Porthcawl 18 months ago, Mr Egan lived in Colchester and faced a 75-mile . drive to work via the M25 that took an hour and 40 minutes. ‘We decided for the extra hour or so on top we might as well move somewhere further away which was a nicer place,’ he said. Since . moving to Wales, he sometimes stays near Watford – in rented . accommodation or a hotel – if he is working late, but generally prefers . to go home. Mr Egan (left, on his way to work and, right, after his commute, at his workplace in Watford) says the crippling hours mean he loses out on quality time with his partner Sarah and he has had to cut down his exercise regime . ‘I use the . journey home to sort my day out in my head and to make a plan for the . following day,’ he said. ‘I use the time to take important conference . calls – hands-free, of course – and my car is quite tech-savvy so I can . listen to my text messages. ‘But there are times when I have to get Sarah to call me to make sure I don’t fall asleep at the wheel.’ Last . night an AA spokesman described Mr Egan’s commute as a sign of the . ‘enormous pressure on people to stay in employment and keep the family . stable and happy’. He added: ‘But people driving these sort of distances . every day do get used to it. It is a sign of the times and the pressure . of modern life. ‘The AA . recommends all drivers should take a driving break every two hours for . ten or 20 minutes.

"'I'm sorry': Millicent Waddell had wanted to stay in London, an inquest heard . A boarding school pupil hanged herself in her bathroom at home after leaving a note that simply said: 'I'm sorry', an inquest heard today . Tragic Millicent Waddell, 16, locked herself in the bathroom of her mother's £400,000 home before taking her own life. Her horrified mum, Louisa-Kate Foster, discovered her body after breaking into the room when her daughter failed to respond to her knocking on the door. The inquest at Shepton Mallet, Somerset, heard Millie had become unhappy after moving from her father Robert Waddell's home in London to her mother's house in Somerset. But Tony Williams, coroner for East Somerset, said there was 'no prior indication' that the teenager would harm herself. Reading a statement from Millie's mother, who did not attend the inquest, Mr Williams said: 'Millicent had wanted to stay in London but things had not worked out and so Millicent came, in early April, to live with her mother. 'Millicent was in the process of deciding whether she wanted to go to college or find a job. 'She was angry with her situation. She wanted to stay in London but there was no indication that she might self harm in any way.' Millie attended Sexey's School in Bruton, Somerset, a Church of England state boarding school which charges up to £8,400 a year. Mrs Foster's statement told how she returned to their home in Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, at 5.40pm on the day of Millie's death, May 29 last year, but did not see her daughter. She later heard the shower running in the bathroom and knocked on the door at 7.20pm but did not receive a reply. The mother left home for a meeting and returned at 9.15pm - when she found the door still locked.Mr Williams added: 'She decided she would need to force the door.' Ms Foster forced her way into the room and found her daughter hanged, he told the court. 'A note was found at the property in Millicent's handwriting that simply read: ""I'm sorry"",' he added. Robert Waddell, Millie's father, provided a statement confirming there had been no concerns that she would harm herself before her death. Police attended the £400,000 detached home but could not save Millie. 'Unhappy': Millicent, known as Millie, attended Sexey's School, a Church of England boarding school in Bruton, Somerset . A toxicology report later showed she had 79mg of alcohol per 100ml - the maximum for driving is 80mg. No prescription or illegal drugs were found in her system, the inquest heard. Pathologist Dr Robert Blahut, at Yeovil District Hospital, confirmed the cause of Millie's death as hanging. Mr Williams told the inquest at East Somerset Coroner's Court: 'There is no evidence to suggest third party involvement. 'I take into account the note that was left by Millicent with two words explaining her actions. 'Millicent knew while she was in the family home she would not be disturbed while she was in the bathroom. My formal finding is that Millicent took her own life.' The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.","Millicent Waddell, 16, had left London to live in Somerset with her mother .

"Cream songwriter Gail Collins, who gained infamy for shooting dead her rock star husband in 1983, has died in a Mexican village aged 72. Collins's landlord found her dead in her apartment on December 6 in Ajijic, a mountain resort town, where she had been living as a recluse with her three cats. A close friend of the infamous lyricist suggested to goodreads.com blogger David J. Krajicek that the star's dying moments - alone and exiled - were somehow penance for the deadly events 30 years ago. 'It’s something she lived with every day of her life - one of . those piece-of-s*** moments that you never get away from, no matter how . hard you try,' Diane Pearl said. Scroll down for video . Songwriter: Gail Collins wrote the 'Strange Brew' lyrics for Cream's 'Disraeli Gears', produced by Felix Pappalardi . Neighbor Joan Montgomery said a veterinarian euthanized Collins' three cats once her body was removed. 'She left instructions for her cats to be euthanized so their ashes could be mixed with hers,' Montgomery said. 'Who does that?' Meanwhile Pearl said the strong-willed artist always wanted to be the center of attention. 'She was one of the most brilliant people I have ever known, but she was also an opinionated jackass,' she said. 'It was her way or the highway. Ego, the thing that drove her brilliance, also destroyed most of her relationships. She just needed to be the star. 'And if someone else was going to be the star, she rebelled against it. It was like a very strange competition of trying to be the best at everything.' According to Krajicek, Collins told people she moved to Mexico for experimental cancer treatment. Collins, who was known locally by her middle name Delta, also claimed she was one of 24 guinea pig patients receiving 'nutrition-infused medicines' from doctor supposedly linked to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Murdered: Collins was convicted of criminally negligent homicide over the shooting death of her husband Felix Pappalardi (pictured) and spent two years in prison . Collins was considered one of the most intriguing musical figures of the 1960s and 1970s. She was married to the legendary bass player/producer Felix Pappalardi of Mountain, a ground-breaking hard rock band from New York. An inspired writer, Collins penned the trippy lyrics that Eric Clapton sang in 'Strange Brew,' a single from Cream’s 1967 psychedelic classic, 'Disraeli Gears', which Pappalardi produced. She became a creative force behind Mountain, writing lyrics for most of the band’s songs and painting their album cover art. However, her life took a turn for the worst in 1983 when she shot and killed Pappalardi after he returned to their  Waterside Plaza, New York apartment following a tryst with a lover. Convicted of criminally negligent homicide, Collins spent two years in prison and disappeared after her 1985 parole.

"A petition is urging Israeli airline El Al to stop ultra-orthodox Jew passengers 'bullying, intimidating and discriminating against women'. The petition, which at the time of writing has 1,500 signatures, comes after passengers aboard an El Al flight from New York's JFK to Israel recently caused a delay after hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews demanded that other passengers trade places before takeoff, saying they cannot sit next to women. It's been organised by Sharon Shapiro from Chicago, who wrote: 'If a passenger was being verbally or physically abusive to airline staff, they would immediately be removed from the plane. A petition is urging Israeli airline El Al to stop orthodox Jew passengers 'bullying, intimidating and discriminating against women' 'If a passenger was flouting the rules for take-off, thereby causing flight delay, they would immediately be removed from the plane. 'If a passenger was openly engaging in racial or religious discrimination against another passenger or flight attendant, they would immediately be removed from the plane. 'Why then, does El Al Airlines allow gender discrimination against women? Why does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines? One person's religious rights do not trump another person's civil rights.' Recently, passengers aboard an El Al flight from New York's JFK to Israel caused a delay after hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews demanded that other passengers trade places before takeoff . Haredi Jews are a stream of Orthodox Jews characterized by their rejection of mainstream secular culture. Haredim regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of Jews and although this claim is contested by other streams of Judaism, it is a perception which is often held in wider Jewish and non-Jewish society. The disrupted flight from New York to JFK was transporting Israeli and Jewish passengers, including some ultra-Orthodox Jews, to the Holy Land in time for the start of the Jewish New Year. However, many of the male Jews refused to sit next to other female passengers prior to the takeoff. The tactic not only delayed the flight, but also went onto cause chaos on board. 'People stood in the aisles and refused to go forward,' said Amit Ben-Natan, a passenger who was on board the plane. 'Although everyone had tickets with seat numbers that they purchased in advance, they asked us to trade seats with them, and even offered to pay money, since they cannot sit next to a woman. It was obvious that the plane wouldn't take off as long as they keep standing in the aisles.' Passengers claimed that despite the El Al flight crew informing travelers that they did not have to agree to switch, the plane's captain announced the flight would not be going anywhere until everyone was seated. 'It was an 11-hour long nightmare,' one of the passengers said. Galit, another traveler on the flight, said the ultra-orthodox passengers suggested she and her spouse split up to better accommodate their desired seating arrangements: 'Why should I agree to switch places?' she said with anger to Shalom Life. After she refused, the ultra-Orthodox man known as a Haredi ended up swapping with her after he continued to stand in the aisle as soon as the plane had taken off. Haredim regard themselves as the most authentic custodians of Jewish religious law and tradition which, in their opinion, is binding and unchangeable. They consider all other expressions of Judaism, including Modern Orthodoxy, as deviations from God's laws . Many passengers have reported that after takeoff a large portion of the travelers took to the aisles to pray which causing them to become crowded and flight attendants unable to serve drinks or distribute meals. El Al has responded to the claims and promised to look into the issue. It said: 'El Al does everything it can to give its passengers the best possible service year-round. Our crews on the ground and in the air are doing the best they can to address the needs and requests of all our travelers while trying not to fall behind schedule . 'The company will examine the complaints and if some passengers are found to have acted out of line we will examine its future steps.' Ms Shapiro believes pre-booked segregation is the answer. She said: 'If El Al Airlines wants to truly accommodate all of its passengers, it will reserve a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight, where for a fee, those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take-off to change seats with them - thereby avoiding arguments, bullying, and delayed take-off.'","A petition is urging El Al to stop ultra-orthodox Jews 'bullying women'

"Louis Denyer claims he can speak fluent cat after growing up around the animals and studying their behaviour. The 29-year-old, who calls himself ‘Cat Man’, communicates by blinking slowly and reading the animal’s body language. Mr Denyer, who taught himself how to interact with cats by watching documentaries, said: ‘I will make myself vulnerable, before slowly blink at a cat. Nine times out of ten, they will blink back. That is them telling me that they're willing to trust me.’ Scroll down for video . Louis Denyer, 29, from Lytham St Anne's, Lancashire, claims he can speak fluent cat after developing a special bind with the felines . ‘I'm very confident that I have the knowledge to solve a cat's problems. You get to learn what makes a cat tick.’ Mr Denyer, from Lytham St Anne's, Lancashire, grew up around cats and believes his unique bond can help the owners of problem animals. The self-proclaimed cat whisperer is now offering his services after setting up his own feline behaviourist business. He said: ‘I'm in it to save cats' lives, that's the whole point of why I'm doing it. ‘I just feel there's too many cases of mistreated cats, and cats that are misbehaving and being punished. Mr Denyer, who runs a feline behaviourist business, communicates with cats by blinking slowly at them . Playtime: Mr Denyer says it's important to spend at least 20 minutes a day playing with your cat to understand them . ‘Cats are very territorial animals who need to know they own the whole space where they live. ‘I want to not only help cats but to educate people about them too.’ Problems that Mr Denyer frequently encounters include cats that miss the litter box, cats that spray around the house, and loud meowing at night. He said: ‘Everything they do is for a reason. I will tackle every issue to stop them from doing it anymore. Tail:Tail straight up or straight up with a curl at the end: Happy.Tail twitching: Excited or anxious.Tail fur sticks straight up while the tail curls up: Aggression.Tail held low and tucked under the rear: Frightened.Eyes:Dilated pupils: Very playful or excited. It can also indicate aggression.Slowly blinking eyes: Affection.Head:Ears pinned back: Fear, anxiety, aggression.Tongue flicking: Worry, apprehension.Rubbing head, flank and tail against a person or animal: Greeting ritual, ownership claim.Head-butting: Friendliness, affection.Face sniffing: Confirming identity.Wet nose kiss: Affection.Licking: Affection. ‘For example if a cat is missing the litter tray, that tells me that it's territorially insecure. It's desperately trying to mark its territory. ‘I would look at the other causes and see whether it's a change in circumstance, it's not just the cat trying to be naughty. ‘They don't react well to change, and it can make them feel very insecure.’ Mr Denyer, who helps out at Cat Rescue Fylde in St Annes, said he hopes he can teach owners how to understand their pets. He said: ‘My end goal is to have my own show helping other people to really understand their cat. ‘People don't realise that playing with your cats for 20 minutes and tiring them out will solve a lot of problems. ‘It's as important as taking your dog out for a walk.’ A spokesperson for RSPCA Blackpool said: ‘We don't do anything behaviour wise but I'm sure what he's doing would be beneficial.’","Louis Denyer, 29, grew up around the animals and calls himself 'Cat Man'

"A pharmacy technician who shot his female colleague dead before turning the gun on himself was trying to pursue a romantic relationship with the victim, police have said. The 58-year-old suspect, who is yet to have been named, walked into part of the Ben Taub General Hospital complex in Houston, Texas, on Sunday and shot the younger woman several times at point blank range while her back was turned. Seven employees and dozens of customers waiting to pick up prescriptions were in the building at the time of the shooting, but no one else was hurt.

Spokesman John Cannon told Fox News that the pair had worked together for several years, but the man was trying to take the relationship 'to another level'. 'In recent days or weeks, he had tried to enhance their friendship or relationship,' he said. According to Click 2 Houston, the victim's back was turned and he never saw gunman coming. Cannon added: 'She was standing at her work station when the suspect walks by and then is out of her range, she cannot see him and at that time that's when he discharges his weapon.' George Masi, president and CEO of Harris Health System, which operates Ben Taub, issued a statement that read: 'At this most difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the two staff who lost their lives as a result of this senseless violence, as well as to every Harris Health System employee and the members of our medical staff.'

"Barack Obama's Pastor-in-Chief has revealed how the President comforted Sandy Hook victims' families in the days after last year's elementary school massacre. 'The president took a deep breath and . steeled himself, and went into the first classroom. And what happened next I will never forget,' Joshua DuBois, who joined the U.S. President in Newtown, Connecticut, said. 'Person . after person received an engulfing hug from our commander in chief.

Tell me about your daughter', . and then hold pictures of the lost beloved as their parents described . favorite foods, television shows, and the sound of their laughter.'

Dubois has shared Obama's 'secret' tender moments with the devastated families in his new book, The President's Devotional: The Daily Readings That Inspired President Obama. The day after the 14 December shooting, in which 26 people were gunned down by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, Obama asked Dubois to accompany him to Newtown to meet with victims' families. Before Dubois left, FBI officials briefed him on the horrors of the massacre, including that the children were lined up and executed. 'How the gunman treated the children like criminals, lining them up to shoot them down,' Dubois wrote, according to Huffington Post. 'How so many bullets penetrated them that many were left unrecognizable. 'How the killer went from one classroom to another and would have gone farther if his rifle would’ve let him.'

When Obama arrived at Newtown High School where the meetings would take place, he was briefed on the circumstances of each family. He then took a deep breath, and met with each grieving family in various classrooms over several hours and asked them to tell him their story. 'For . the younger siblings of those who had passed away—many of them two, . three, or four years old, too young to understand it all—the president . would grab them and toss them, laughing, up into the air, and then hand . them a box of White House M&M’s, which were always kept close at . hand,' Dubois wrote. 'In each room, I saw his eyes water, but he did not break...Even a president’s comfort was woefully inadequate for these families in the face of this particularly unspeakable loss. 'But it became some small measure of love, on a weekend when evil reigned. 'And the funny thing is—President Obama has never spoken about these meetings...It must have been one of the defining moments of his presidency, quiet hours in solemn classrooms, extending as much healing as was in his power to extend.

"Amazon.com, the world's largest online retailer, attracted the attention of the Obama administration yesterday when it announced that it will be adding 7,000 American workers to it's payroll. President Obama is set to visit the 1 million square foot 'fulfillment warehouse' in Chattanooga, Tennessee this afternoon - which was the single biggest job creator in the state when it opened in 2011. Mr Obama plans to speak about middle-class jobs, which makes the Amazon backdrop surprising. Full-time positions: Amazon is focused on speeding up order fulfillment, so 5,000 of the positions will be at distribution centers in 10 states . Amazon says it pays 30 per cent more . than the $10 an hour median for retail workers. But even at $13 an hour, . that's only a $27,000 a year salary. According to the Pew Research Center, the current three-person middle-class household brings in $69,487 in annual income. Two adults working at Amazon for $13 an hour wouldn't make the cut for that definition of middle class. And . $13 an hour may be pushing it, since the Wall Street Journal estimated . yesterday that the company pays closer to $11 an hour for jobs in picking, packing . and shipping orders. That's . where most of the hiring will be in the next few months, as the company . looks to beef up staff at warehouses where it fills orders. Positions available: The company is hiring a total of 7,000 new employees at facilities in 13 states . Five-thousand of the jobs will be at Amazon's U.S. distribution centers,  which currently employ about 20,000 workers who pack and ship customer orders. The company has been spending heavily on order fulfillment, a strategy meant to help the business grow, but one that has also weighed on profit margins. The company said last week that it lost money in the second quarter, even as revenue increased. Distribution center jobs are available in Phoenix, Arizona; Middletown, Delaware; Patterson, San Bernardino and Tracy, California; Indianapolis and Jeffersonville, Indiana; Hebron, Kentucky; Breinigsville, Pennslyvania; Charleston and Spartanburg, South Carolina.; Chattanooga and Murfreesboro, Tennesse; Coppell, Haslet and San Antonio, Texas and Chester, Virginia. Special visitor: President Obama is set to visit an Amazon facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee today . The company is also adding 2,000 jobs in customer service, including full-time, part-time and seasonal. Jobs are available in Winchester, Kentucky; Grand Forks, North Dakota; Kennewick, Washington and Huntington, West Virginia Work from home positions are available in Oregon, Washington and Arizona. Growing: Amazon will be hiring 2,000 workers for their customer service division . These 7,000 new Amazon.com employees will definitely perk up the oil industry, which has been seeing a drop in the price of gasoline. More workers means more drivers, and a higher demand for oil. 'We'll look to position ourselves for Friday's number and get a better gauge one how fast demand is growing and going,' Carl Larry of Oil Outlooks and Opinions said in a commentary. 'I think that demand is definitely more correlated to the number of people, which in turn leads to a lot more drivers.'","Focused on order fulfillment, Amazon is adding 5,000 full-time jobs in it's distribution centers .

"Suspect: Mehdi Nemmouche is facing extradition from France to Belgium over a shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels that killed four people . A French court today approved the extradition to Belgium of the suspect in a shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels that left four people dead. Frenchman Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, has been held in police custody on anti-terror laws on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and possession of weapons in relation to the attack on May 24 since being arrested in the southern city of Marseille on May 30. Nemmouche had originally refused extradition then later agreed to it provided that Belgium would not send him to a third country for trial. His lawyer, Apolin Pepiezep, has said that Nemmouche was concerned that he would be sent to Israel, given that two of the victims of the attack were Israeli. Prosecutors say Nemmouche was a repeat offender in France, having been convicted on counts of armed robbery, assault and vandalism, among other crimes, and spent most of 2013 in Syria fighting with Islamist rebels. European governments are increasingly worried that citizens going to fight in Syria will import Islamist militancy on their return. The attack by a man who opened fire with a Kalashnikov rifle killed an Israeli couple and a French woman. A Belgian man also shot and injured in the attack died on June 6. When arrested at a Marseille bus terminal, Nemmouche was carrying a Kalashnikov, another gun and ammunition similar to that used in the shooting, prosecutors said. Pepiezep said Nemmouche told police he had stolen them from a car in Brussels. Vehicles carrying Mehdi Nemmouche leave the Versailles Court of Appeal after judges approved his extradition . Nemmouche has three days to appeal the decision. If he does, the Versailles appeals court will have 40 days to rule on whether or not to extradite him. If he does not, he will be extradited at the end of that period. 'He will most likely appeal the decision,' said Pepiezep. 'He has not received a guarantee from Belgium that he would not be extradited to a third country.' An extradition within EU member states takes on average 16 days if the suspect agrees to it, according to the European Commission. An appeal was likely only to delay rather than block his transfer to Brussels, legal sources said.

"Dominic Francis has organised a demonstration on the Baroness Thatcher funeral route . Protesters plan to disrupt Baroness Thatcher’s funeral by turning their backs on the funeral cortege as it passes. Thousands of people are supporting the plot as the eyes of millions of people turn on St Paul’s Cathedral next Wednesday. The architect of the protest is Dominic Francis, 25, whose parents live in a £700,000 home in Royal Tunbridge Wells. Mr Francis, a student at Ruskin . College in Oxford, said mourners had brought the disturbance on . themselves by holding such a public event. He was urging protests with a ‘heavy heart’ because of the ‘State funding’ of the huge ceremonial event. Mr Francis said the action would be . peaceful, adding: ‘I support that her mourners should be allowed to . grieve in peace. But when they decided to hold a State-funded, large . ceremony like that, they open themselves up to public criticism.’ Today, police are focusing on . Trafalgar Square, with thousands of anarchists, Left-wingers and trade . unionists vowing to descend on the landmark to ‘celebrate’ Lady . Thatcher’s death.

Fanatics hope a . ‘protest’ in Central London tomorrow will ignite an explosion of . violence that will culminate with disturbances at her funeral on . Wednesday. Thousands are set to rejoice the Iron Lady's death at up to 25 locations across the UK, with the biggest one planned for Trafalgar Square. It was the scene of the notorious Poll Tax riots in 1990, just before Lady Thatcher left power. The protesters' campaign of violence is fuelled by rallying threats posted on networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Police intelligence analysts are monitoring a growing torrent of disturbing online messages. Dozens of groups are urging others to ‘take to the streets’, including one under the title: ‘If Thatcher does get a State Funeral We Will Riot.’ Central London’s streets will be cleared of traffic on the day and the 87-year-old former prime minister’s coffin will be taken to the door of St Paul's Cathedral on a horse-drawn gun carriage. Protesters plan to turn their back to the cortege, and other could try to disrupt it. 'London's police, the MPS, City of London and British Transport Police, are working together to deliver a security operation for Baroness Thatcher's funeral,' a Metropolitan Police spokesman has said. 'Given the nature of the event our operation will use of a range of appropriate tactics.' A terrorist group that has previously admitted sending parcel bombs is among the organisations being linked to threatened protests today. A message posted on a website linked to the Informal Anarchist Federation hinted at its support for Thatcher 'death parties', according to a report in the Sun. It said: 'Expect the pigs to turn up!' More than 40 parties are believed to have been planned in locations across the country, including Birmingham, Manchester and Sheffield. The Informal Anarchist Federation has claimed responsibility for sending letter bombs to targets in Italy in the past. On the evening after Baroness Thatcher's death, 300 people assembled in Glasgow's George Square with party hats and streamers, and 150 people threw a raucous celebration in Brixton, south London. Demonstrators also climbed up the nearby Ritzy Cinema and re-arranged the film titles outside to say: 'Margaret Thatcher's dead. Equality is the key.' Extra police were called to Brixton as the party raged on until nearly 2am. Two women were arrested on suspicion of burglary after being found inside a shop whose front windows had been smashed.","25-year-old Dominic Francis studies at Oxford's Ruskin College .

"Warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition have struck Islamic State fighters in Syria attacking a town near the Turkish border for the first time. The Islamic State group's assault on the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani has sent more than 100,000 refugees streaming across the border into Turkey in recent days as Kurdish forces from Iraq and Turkey have raced to the front lines to defend the town. Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or PYD, said the strikes targeted Islamic State positions near Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, destroying two tanks. He said the jihadi fighters later shelled the town, wounding a number of civilians. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: Still image taken from black and white video from a plane camera shows smoke rising after a strike near Kobani, a strategic Syrian town near the Turkish border, yesterday. ISIS militants are attacking the town . The United States, France and five Arab allies launched an aerial campaign against Islamic State fighters in Syria early on Tuesday with the aim of rolling back and ultimately crushing the extremist group, which has created a state spanning the Syria-Iraq border. Along the way, the militants have massacred captured Syrian and Iraqi troops, terrorised minorities in both countries and beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker. Labour's decision to oppose military strikes against the Syrian regime last year - leading Mr Cameron to abandon the proposal after suffering defeat in the Commons - had 'emboldened' the West's enemies, Commons leader William Hague said. It had 'not helped perceptions of the west being ready to defend itself', he added. Meanwhile The Sunday Mirror has reported that MI6 has been in talks with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s regime over attacking ISIS fighters in Syria. Spy chiefs have reportedly been negotiating with senior foreign office diplomats in the Syrian capital Damascus. Moments from destruction: The target, close to the Syria-Turkey border, before the bombs hit . Destruction: A bright flash is seen as the target is struck by the airstrike . the coalition's strikes near Kobani came amid heavy fighting between the Islamic State group and members of the Kurdish force known as the People's Protection Units . Both Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and David Cameron have insisted that Britain will not strike deals with the Assad, whose regime is fighting ISIS. A source told the paper: 'It may be there are no face-to-face meetings with Assad himself but behind the double-speak of foreign relations it is perfectly normal for them to see his senior people. It would be staggering if Britain’s intelligence agencies were not talking to Assad’s people. 'The talks they have within Syria are of invaluable benefit to Britain’s security.' The latest air strikes came as Syria's foreign minister Walid al-Moallem told the Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV that air strikes alone 'will not be able to wipe out' the Islamic State group. Speaking from New York where he is attending the UN General Assembly, Mr al-Moallem said that the U.S. should work with Damascus if it wants to win the war. Flee: A Turkish soldier stands guarded as Kurdish Syrian refugees wait to cross to Turkey in the Turkish-Syrian border near the southeastern town of Suruc in Sanliurfa province of Turkey . The United States and five Arab allies launched an aerial campaign against Islamic State fighters in Syria early on Tuesday with the aim of rolling back and ultimately crushing the extremist group . 'They must know the importance of coordination with the people of this country because they know what goes on there,' Mr al-Moallem said. The U.S. has ruled out any coordination with President Bashar Assad's government, which is at war with the Islamic State group as well as Western-backed rebels. The former head of the UK military raised questions the effectiveness of isolated air attacks against ISIS militants. Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, a former head of the UK military who stepped down as chief of the defence staff last year, told the Sunday Times that the terror group would not be defeated by air attacks alone and that a conventional campaign involving ground troops would be needed to crush them. Lord Richards said: 'Ultimately you need a land army to achieve the objectives we've set ourselves - all air will do is destroy elements of IS, it won't achieve our strategic goal. 'The only way to defeat IS is to take back land they are occupying which means a conventional military operation. The only way to do it effectively is to use western armies, but I understand the political resistance.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the coalition's strikes near Kobani came amid heavy fighting between the Islamic State group and members of the Kurdish force known as the People's Protection Units, or YPK. The Britain-based group, which relies on activists inside Syria, had no immediate word on casualties from the strikes. The Observatory reported yesterday that 13 civilians have been killed by the strikes since they began. Kurdish fighter Majid Goran told the Associated Press by telephone from Kobani that two bombs were dropped over the nearby village of Ali Shar but that the positions they struck were empty. Turkey's Dogan news agency reported that the sound of heavy fighting could be heard from the Turkish border village of Karaca. The agency said Kurdish forces retook some positions they had lost to the Islamic militants a few days ago. Dozens of people wounded in the fighting arrived in Turkey for treatment, it said. Another Kurdish fighter, Ismet Sheikh Hasan, said the Turkish military retaliated after stray shells landed on Turkish territory, firing in the Ali Shar region. He said the Turkish action left Kurdish fighters in the middle of the crossfire. He said that yesterday the Islamic militants were attacking the Kobani area from the east with tanks and artillery, advancing on Ali Shar and Haja. He said some 20 people were killed, including Kurdish fighters and civilians, while another 50 people were wounded. The fighting around Kobani sparked one of the largest single outflows of refugees since Syria's conflict began more than three years ago.

Two RAF Tornado GR4's during the RAF's first combat mission against Islamic State militants in northern Iraq . British warplanes flew their first mission over Iraq since parliament authorised strikes against Islamic State jihadists, but returned without bombing yesterday . The Syrian Kurdish forces have long been one of the most effective fighting units battling the Islamic State, but the tide has turned in recent weeks as the Islamic militants have attacked with heavy weapons likely looted from neighbouring Iraq. The Observatory said other coalition air strikes targeted Islamic State compounds in the central province of Homs and the northern regions of Raqqa and Aleppo. The group said 31 explosions were heard in the city of Raqqa, the group's de facto capital, and its suburbs. The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said the strikes in the east hit the province of Deir el-Zour as well as Raqqa. The LCC also said the coalition targeted grain silos west of Deir el-Zour city. Max Blumenfeld, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the U.S. air strikes 'don't target food or anything else than can be used by the civilian population'. But he said that until the military reviews images from planes that participated in the strikes, he could not rule out that silos were hit. A Kurdish Peshmerga fighter stands guard near the Mullah Abdullah Bridge, located on the road between Irbil and Kirkuk in Iraq. The tense standoff with the Islamic State militants frustrates many of the young soldiers, even as other units make gains with the help of U.S. and French airstrikes . He said the air strikes are aimed at specific Islamic State targets such as command and control centres, transportation and logistics, and oil refineries, 'but not food that could have an impact upon the civilian population'. 'Our targets are structures that combatants would use,' he said. Mr Blumenfeld later said the U.S. did target what he called an Islamic State grain storage facility on Tuesday near Boukamal, a town close to the Iraqi border which was seized by the Islamic State group earlier this year. Sniper HQ of Al-Qaeda group flattened by Coalition airstrikes . The headquarters of the deadly snipers of the Al-Nusra Front was reportedly destroyed by Coalition airstrikes over the weekend. The building, in a residential area of Al-Muhandisin district of Aleppo, Syria, was flattened by a bomb. A number of other buildings were also hit, and rescuers were pictured attempting to dig out people trapped under rubble following the carnage. The Al-Nusra Front is Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria and has long been one of the most effective forces fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. However it was weakened this year by battles with Islamic State. The two share the same ideology and rigid Islamic beliefs, but fell out during a power struggle that pitted Islamic State head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi against al Qaeda chief Ayman Zawahri and Nusra Front leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani. But U.S.-led air and missile strikes, which have hit Nusra as well as Islamic State bases in Syria, have angered many members who say the West and its allies have joined forces in a 'crusader' campaign against Islam - so IS and Al-Nusra should do the same.

"As the saying goes, some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Now a new study claims to have proven the theory that great leaders such as Sir Winston Churchill or Margaret Thatcher are all born - not made. Research by a leading military academic claims to have put the debate on whether it is nature or nurture which creates greatness to bed after finding the most effective really are a breed apart, and have brains that are wired differently to most. A new study has backed up the theory that great leaders such as Sir Winston Churchill or Margaret Thatcher are born - not made . The discovery could revolutionise how . organisations assess and develop leaders, with brain scans being used to . identify those with the 'leadership gene' early and train them . accordingly. It seems the most successful have more grey matter in places that control decision making and memory, giving them a vital edge when it comes to making the right call. Management expert Professor Sean Hannah, of Wake Forest University in the United States, said: 'Once we have confirmed how the brain works in these leaders, we can create an 'expert' profile. 'This profile can help us develop brain training methods to enhance brain functioning in leaders, such as the neurofeedback techniques that have been successfully used with elite athletes, concert musicians and financial traders.' The discovery could revolutionise how organisations assess and develop leaders, with brain scans being used to identify those with the 'leadership gene' Scans of 103 volunteers from the US Military Academy at West Point, ranging in rank from officer cadet to major, found neural networks in the frontal and prefrontal lobes of those deemed 'leaders' were different from the rest. These areas of the brain are associated with self-regulation, decision making and memory. The study was published in the American Psychological Association's Journal of Applied Psychology. The officers, 87 of whom were men, were defined as being more psychologically complex if they had a more diverse sense of their own abilities and accomplishments as leaders. In addition to a series of questions, and physical and mental tests, half underwent 'brain mapping' - a quantitative electroencephalography scan. Using electrodes placed on 19 different locations on subjects' heads, researchers were able to track activity in particular areas of the brain while the participant was at rest. Researchers also tested leadership and decision-making abilities in a hypothetical tactical military expedition. The participants had to lead their unit to interact with hostile and non-hostile civilians, enemy forces, the media and, eventually, the shooting down of a U.S. helicopter during an international humanitarian relief mission in Africa. Former military officers with significant experience in these types of situations rated the officers' responses to the scenario based on their adaptability, situational awareness and decisions. Leaders who had a more complex sense of their leadership skills and greater neurological complexity were found to be more adaptive and effective leaders in these scenarios. Prof Hannah, a retired Colonel with 26 years of experience in the U.S. Army, said the results are a step toward finding out how effective and adaptable leaders not only think and act, but how their brains are wired to lead.","Scientists say scans reveal leaders have brains that are wired differently .

"A mother and father pictured clutching two young girls outside the flattened Briarwood Elementary School in a now-iconic photograph of Monday's tornado devastation last night described the horrific ordeal. Ledonna Cobb, who was inside a classroom when the EF-5 twister struck, said she was 'grabbing onto whatever I could' in an attempt to stay grounded and protect the students she had used her own body to shield. 'I was just grabbing onto whatever I could,' she said. 'Once the roof came off the building I felt myself being sucked and I knew if I was taken, all the babies underneath me would be gone too so I just held on. I held on for dear life.' Ms Cobb is shown in the harrowing . image bruised and dripping with blood. She said she was knocked out when . one of the classroom walls fell on top of her.

'I decided to be the best dad I could . at that time and wanted (Jordan) to feel like she was safe and that we were all going to be OK,' Mr Cobb told Dianne Sawyer on ABC World News, . describing the photograph that has graced newspaper covers and websites . the world over. 'It's like you're in a movie. It's like everyone is playing a part and we were all acting or something like that. It doesn't seem real to you that this is occurring.' Little Jordan told Sawyer the frightening tornado seemed to go on 'forever.' 'It seemed like it was an hour, it was crazy. I can't even believe we survived that,' she said. She then explained how she was struck by debris as the twister obliterated her school. 'I tried to get up and I tried to move the bricks . off of my leg,' she said. 'The tornado had not left yet and it hurt so much I was screaming ""help, my leg, my leg"" but no one could hear me.'

Miraculously, all Briarwood Elementary students survived the carnage, though students at the nearby Plaza Towers Elementary School weren't so lucky. The family's heroic account comes as hopes of finding victims alive more than 24 hours after the monster two mile-wide tornado fade. On Tuesday night, authorities said rescuers had searched every home in the devastated suburb of Moore and they were '98 per cent sure' there are no more bodies or survivors in the rubble.

On Monday, emergency workers pulled more than 100 survivors from the debris of homes, schools and a hospital. Injuries of adult patients ranged from minor — cuts and bruises, people wet and suffering from hypothermia to major injuries including open wounds, impalements and broken bones. There were also 'degloving' injuries, in which skin is peeled from the tissue. The weather service confirmed on Tuesday that the powerful storm was an EF5 - the maximum on the scale. Seven of the children were found drowned at Plaza Towers Elementary School, which was a direct hit during the 45 minutes of terror. Nine-year-old Janae Hornsby, whose father said 'always has a smile on her face', is one of the seven children. Family members shared pictures of other missing children, including Kyle Davis, 8, and Sydney Angle. Later, Davis' family confirmed he had also died. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, an official confirmed that the two schools which were leveled by the storm did not have safe rooms, as they had not applied for them. He added that the jurisdiction decides where to allocate funds for safe rooms based on past events.

"Music industry legend Clive Davis, the man who discovered or signed countless multi-platinum recording artists including Whitney Houston, Bruce Springsteen and Alicia Keys has revealed he is bisexual. In his new memoir The Soundtrack of My Life, the 80-year-old record executive, who has been married and divorced twice, says he has been involved in two monogamous relationships with men over the past 20 years. Davis, who has never before publicly addressed his sexuality,  writes that his first sexual encounter with a man was during ‘the era of Studio 54’ in the late '70s. Scroll down for video . Music industry legend Clive Davis, who discovered Whitney Houston, has revealed he is bisexual . Twice married Davis, pictured with Alicia Keys, says he has been in two monogamous relationships with men over the past 20 years . Davis, pictured at the 2012 U.S. Open with an unknown male acquaintance, has been in his current relationship since 2004 . ‘On this night, after imbibing enough alcohol, I was open to responding to his sexual overtures,’ he writes. Prior to that he had only been with women and he writes that being with a man provided ‘welcome relief.’ Davis separated from his second wife in 1985 after a period of ‘soul searching and self-analysis’ and says that he went on to have simultaneous relationships with two women and a man. Then in 1990 he entered into a ‘monogamous relationship’ with an unnamed male doctor. That relationship ended in 2004, but Davis says he has been in a relationship with another man ever since. Davis said his current partner attends . industry events and travels with him, but he . declined to reveal his identity in order to protect his privacy. Davis won a grammy for producing Jennifer Hudson's first album in 2009 . Speaking to Katie Couric, Davis said that despite his experience with a man in the late '70s he didn't consider himself bisexual until after the end of his second marriage in 1985 . Star signing: Clive Davis and Whitney Houston signing her first contract with Arista Records in 1983 . Father of four Davis also writes that his coming out deeply affected his ties with one of his three sons, Mitchell. However after ‘one very trying year’ they managed to work out their differences, he writes. Speaking on The Katie Couric Show on Tuesday, Davis said that despite his experience with a man in the late '70s, he didn't consider himself bisexual until after the end of his second marriage in 1985. ‘It didn’t affect either of my marriages,' he told Couric. 'But when my second . marriage ended I opened myself up to the possibility that I could have a relationship with a man as well as the two that I had with a woman.’ ‘I'm still attracted to women. … You don't have to be only one thing or another. For me, it's the person.’ Davis also hopes that his coming out might lead to a 'greater understanding' of bisexuality. 'I’m not lying,' he told ABC News. '[Bisexuality] does exist. For over 50 years I never had sex with a . male. It wasn’t repressed. I had very good sexual relationships with . women.' Davis with Carlos Santana at the Grammy Awards in 2000. Santana's awards included album of the year for 'Supernatural' which Davis co-produced .

Asked if he felt ashamed after first sleeping with a . man, he relied: 'I never felt shame.' 'I felt puzzled. The subject . of bisexuality really needs much more discussion. It's a status that . does exist.' Davis, known as 'the man with the golden ears,' has played a massive role in shaping popular music for well over five decades. He has won five Grammy Awards and is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer. His most successful signing, was Whitney Houston, who he discovered and helped mold into one of the biggest selling artists in music history. Davis devotes an entire chapter in his book, out Tuesday, to working with Whitney. He recalls his trepidations about her acting in The Bodyguard and writes in-depth about the subsequent problems that led to her death. He reprints a letter he wrote to her after seeing an emaciated Houston perform at the 2001 Michael Jackson tribute concert. He wrote: 'Dearest Whitney: When I saw you last night at the Michael Jackson concert, I gasped. When I got home I cried. My dear, dear Whitney. The time has come.' He also reveals that he attempted a one-on-one intervention with her at his upstate New York home, but she wouldn’t listen. 'She was in complete denial,' writes . Davis. 'I knew that if an addict does not want to get help, there . ultimately is very little that anyone else can do.' Davis pictured in 2000 with Whitney Houston, her then husband Bobby Brown, right, and Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs, left . Rod Stewart, pictured with girlfriend Penny Lancaster, has recorded for Clive Davis' label J Records during this century . Family feud: Clive Davis, second left, has confirmed rumors that Michael Jackson had sought to kill-off brother Jermaine's, third left, promising solo career in the 1980s . Davis also recounts the shock of receiving the momentous phone call that Houston was dead. Houston was found dead in the Beverly Hilton hotel in February last year just hours before his annual pre-Grammy party. He writes: 'There are moments when time stands still, and you feel as if . you can’t even begin to comprehend the words that are being spoken to . you. That’s how I felt right then.' Davis also confirms a story first told by Michael Jackson’s longtime PR man Bob Jones that the deceased singer purposely tried to kill off brother Jermaine’s career. Jermaine Jackson had a run of hits in the mid-80s while signed to Davis’ Arista label. Clive hired Kenny ‘Babyface’ Edmonds and LA Reid to produce Jermaine’s fourth album, but then Michael signed them up for his own project thus preventing his brother from working with the producers. ‘Jermaine couldn’t believe that Michael, his close brother, would hijack his producers’ material this way,’ writes Clive. He recalls Jermaine was ‘crying, indeed sobbing at times, so deeply hurt that his brother would do this to him.’ Davis, pictured with Aretha Franklin in 1981, and on the cover of his new book out Tuesday . The older brother was also so angry . that he wrote a song called ‘Word to the Badd,’ which denounced Michael . as shallow and selfish. Michael called Davis up demanding that he take . the song off of Jermaine’s album. Davis writes ‘I felt it would be . wrong for me to tell an artist to take a song off an album. This was a . family and personal matter that they would need to resolve themselves.’ The book also includes juicy . behind-the-scenes stories of some of the best known recording artists of . all time. Davis tells of how Janice Joplin suggested she perform a . sexual act with him to seal their deal, how John Lennon offered him . insight into the creative process and the false accusations that ended . his career at CBS. The . autobiography also chronicles his childhood in Brooklyn, the loss of his . parents when he was still a teen and his scholarship-supported journey . through New York University and then Harvard Law School. Clive Davis has had a massive impact on pop music and pop culture for more than 50 years. After graduating from Harvard Law School he joined Columbia Records Group (CBS) as legal council and soon became president. One of his earliest pop signings was the British folk-rock musician Donovan, who enjoyed a string of successful hit singles and albums released in the USA on the Epic label. In June 1967 he attended the Monterey Pop Festival and immediately signed Janis Joplin. He also signed Santana, Bruce Springsteen, Chicago, Billy Joel, Aerosmith and Pink Floyd. After Davis was fired from CBS Records for allegedly using company funds to bankroll his son's bar mitzvah he founded Arista Records. At Arista, Davis signed Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow and Patti Smith. His most famous signing is Whitney Houston, who he discovered and helped mold into one of the biggest selling artists in music history. He once said of Whitney: 'You wait for a voice like that for a lifetime.You way for a face like that, a smile like that, a presence like that, for a lifetime. And when one person embodies it all, well, it takes your breath away.' He founded LaFace Records, home of TLC, Usher and P!nk, with L.A. Reid and Babyface. He also founded Bad Boy Records, home to Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, with Sean Combs. Davis left Arista in 2000 and started J Records and had continued success with artists including Alicia Keys, Luther Vandross and Rod Stewart. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.He also has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2001 Davis was named 'world's No.1 A&R of 2001' based on worldwide chart data for that year. He has won four Grammy Awards as a Producer:•    2009: Best R&B Album – Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Hudson•    2006: Best Pop Vocal Album – Breakaway, Kelly Clarkson•    2000: Album of the Year – Supernatural, Santana•    2000: Best Rock Album – Supernatural, Santana .

"Middle-aged: It's been said that life begins at 40, but it might be more accurate to say that mid-life begins at 40 according to a Government poll . It’s been said, somewhat optimistically,  that life begins at 40. Now it seems  a more accurate adage might read: Mid-life begins at 40. Or to be precise, according to a study which reveals  general attitudes to youth and ageing, the age at which we should stop calling ourselves young is 40 years, eight months and two weeks. And, rather worryingly, the Britons surveyed reckon old age begins when people reach the age of 59 years, two months and two weeks. The poll, for the Department for Work and Pensions, spoke to 2,171 people aged 16 or over and uncovered stark variations in the views of men and women and different age groups. Men say being young stops at 38 and a half. For women the cut-off is delayed until 42 years, nine months and three months. Old age, according to women, begins at 60 years, four months and two weeks.But for men, it is much earlier – at 58. The gap may be down to men placing more emphasis on diminishing strength as a mark of ageing, or because women tend to live longer. As you might expect, the definition of old age goes back in later life. Under-50s said it begins at 46 years and nine months. For those age 50-plus, old age starts at 62 years, seven months and two weeks. While 16- to 24-year-olds said being young ends at 32, for those aged 80-plus the answer was 52. This is not far short of when the youngest group said old age begins – 54. The Department for Work and Pensions said ‘the disparity in perceptions’ showed ‘the potential for age stereotypes to be applied in very inconsistent ways’. Old age: Britons believe that old age begins at the age of 59 years, two months and two weeks according to a Government poll (file picture) Class and income may also be factors. The unemployed said being young ends nine years earlier than those with full time jobs. People who lived in council houses tended to believe old age started five years  earlier than those who owned their home outright. Ros Altmann of over-50s group Saga said: ‘These surveys show that the older you get, the later you think old age begins. ‘What is happening is that people are suddenly getting to an age and thinking: no, I’m not old actually. I might have thought I would feel old at this age, but I do not. ‘This survey also shows there is significant age discrimination and outdated attitudes among younger people – and that is worrying. ‘Youngsters tend to think people who are older are not up to much. It’s just not true.’","Britons believe that old age begins at 59 years, two months and two weeks .

"An acid attack victim who suffered 95 per cent burns to her face has paid for her 27th round of reconstructive surgery after winning the jackpot on India's biggest quiz show. Sonali Mukherjee, 28, appeared on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in December last year to raise money for her ongoing treatment and to highlight the plight of acid attack victims in her country. She received no state funding after being severely disfigured when a spurned suitor and his friends broke into her room when she was just 17 and doused her body with chemicals. Scroll down for video . Promising student Sonali Mukherjee (pictured left before . the attack) was left permanently disfigured when acid normally used to . clean rusty tool was thrown over her body when she was just 17 (right) Sonali and her father Chandi Das Mukherjee have tried to stay strong since the attack 11 years ago . Before her win, Sonali's family had run out of money to pay for further treatment after selling their ancestral land and her mother's jewellery. Sonali told CNN: 'My father spent every single penny. He sold our land, gold, everything to pay for treatment, hoping for justice. 'In the end we lost everything while the criminals are out there.' She has used jackpot money of Rs 25 lakhs - equivalent to almost £30,000 - to continue her recovery. As well as paying for much needed treatment, Sonali said she hoped her appearance on the show, called Kaun Banega Crorepati, will raise awareness of the suffering of acid attack victims. She told CNN: 'I participated for two reasons. I needed . the money but I wanted the world to know what an acid attack victim . goes through in this country.' Since the attack she has received no money from the state for her treatment and earlier this year she wrote to the Indian . Government threatening to kill herself if she did not receive state aid. Sonali won Rs 25 lakhs when she played Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in December last year . She took part in a one off show called Second Chance, which featured contestants who have shown courage . Sonali said the acid, normally used to . clean rusty tools, felt as if she had been 'thrown into a fire' and said . she was in unbearable pain for the first four months. She was a promising student in her hometown of Dhanbad, in the eastern Indian Jharkhand region, at the time of the attack, which saw her doused in a chemical called Tezaab. Her attackers are currently out on bail. Sonali, who now lives in New Delhi, was left partially blind and deaf as a result of her injuries. Doctors treating Sonali said the burns were so bad that she had no ears, no eyelids and no scalp. Sanjeev Bagai, doctor at CEO BLK Hospital, said: 'The challenge was to give her something like a normal face - somewhere close to what a normal human being will look like.' Sonali Mukherjee used the money from the win to pay for her 27th round of reconstructive surgery . Sonali received no state funding for her ongoing care and threatened to kill herself last year . As well as the harrowing physical scars, the acid attack has left deep emotional scars on her family as well. Sonali's mother struggled to cope with the incident and her grandfather had a heart attack. Her father Chandi Das Mukherjee told CNN: 'Being the head of the family, I couldn't afford to break down. My father died of shock and my wife broke down into depression.' Despite her horrific injuries, Sonali has continually campaigned for tougher laws for acid attackers. This year, the Indian government signed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, which brings in tougher punishment for those who commit violence against women. Acid attack is now defined as a separate penal code offence and perpetrators are recommended to receive a sentence of between ten years and life imprisonment. However, the stronger laws are unlikely to benefit Sonali in her legal case.","Sonali Mukherjee went on the quiz show to raise money for her treatment .

"When Chile striker Mauricio Pinilla smashed an effort towards goal in the final minute of extra-time against Brazil he must have thought he was going to be a hero. But rather than ripping into the top corner to put Chile through and send the hosts crashing out, the ball struck the crossbar, meaning extra-time finished with the score level at 1-1. Rather than try and eradicate the memory of his shot that was agonisingly close to causing a huge upset, Pinilla has chosen to get a tattoo of it on his lower back, with the line, 'One centimetre from glory'.

"A man who is accused of killing his ex-fiance in September 2013 and was charged with drugging and raping her in March has been arrested. Kevin Michael Adams, 50, of Frisco, Texas was arrested on Friday. He is charged with capital murder and is currently held at the Collin County sheriff's detention center, CBS DFW reports. Adams allegedly killed his reported stockbroker ex-fiance Nicole Leger, 34, who was found dead in her Melissa, Texas home by her 17-year-old son after school on September 9, 2013, according to WFAA. According to the arrest warrant, Leger died from two gunshot wounds to her face. Kevin Michael Adams, pictured, is believed by authorities to be responsible for the September 2013 death of his ex-fiance, Nicole Leger. Adams was previously charged with aggravated sexual assault in March 2013 after he allegedly drugged, tied up and raped Leger in his garage . Leger was also allegedly attacked and sexually assaulted by Adams at his Frisco residence in March 2013 when she went to pick up some of her things, The Dallas Morning News reports. Leger and Adams had lived together in Frisco before breaking up in February 2013. Adams allegedly drugged her food, tied her up in his garage and raped her, CBS DFW says. In March he was charged with aggravated sexual assault and unlawful restraint. Leger was granted an emergency protective order in March when Adams posted bail, the channel adds. Her son reportedly told police Adams has threatened to kill his mother, as well. In April 2013, Adams reportedly violated his protective order when he sent Leger a card and flowers, CBS DFW reports. Nicole Leger, pictured, reportedly died from two gunshots to the face in September 2013. She reportedly filed a restraining order against Adams in March 2013 for his alleged drugging and rape of her . Adams' DNA, collected during the March 2013 sexual assault case, linked him to Leger's Melissa residence, which he was not supposed to know about, the channel adds. Adams had told authorities that he was in Frisco at the time of Leger's murder and had previously been considered a person of interest in the case, according to WFAA. The channel adds that Adams reportedly had a large collection of weapons and ammunition, including some stored in a storage unit owned by his ex-wife. In a search of the unit, an unfired bullet's markings matched a shell casing at the crime scene of his ex-fiance's death. The warrant for Adams' arrest also says an office investigating the case believes Adams killed Leger to prevent her testimony in the sexual assault case, WFAA adds.","Kevin Adams, 50, was arrested on Friday for the death of 'ex-fiance' Nicole Leger, 34 .

"A private doctor’s surgery run by Poles is attracting thousands of patients who have given up on the NHS. Open seven days a week, usually until 11pm, the clinic gives half-hour appointments – three times longer than usual. And, despite charging £70 a visit, it already has almost 6,000 Britons on its books. Customers are welcomed into the spotless and modern centre by friendly receptionists whose motto is to ‘put patients first’. Clinic Manager Radek Przypis in one of three state of the art dental treatment rooms at the My Medyk Polish Clinic . Radek Przypis, who manages the My Medyk clinic in West London, said he realised there was ‘a gap in the market because NHS care was so poor’. He added: ‘You have heard the stories about people going to GPs and whatever is wrong with you they give you a paracetamol and tell you to go away. ‘People find it hard to get help. They want to come to one place that they know, where they know what to expect, get the treatment and from people they trust. ‘Our patients are our customers, they are the most important things for us, that is our company motto. Perhaps that is not always the same attitude with the NHS.’ Research shows that two thirds of Health . Service patients have to wait more than 48 hours for a doctor’s . appointment and few slots are available outside the regular working . week. Fees for writing out prescriptions are included ¿ but not the cost of the drugs themselves. Treatments available include a pregnancy ultrasound scan for £90 and stitches for £45. It has 30,000 patients on its books ¿ five times the average for a GP surgery ¿ and between 15 and 20 per cent are British. The only day it is not open until 11pm is Sunday, when it shuts at 6pm . Out-of-hours patients are almost certain to be seen by a locum or a senior nurse. The Polish clinic, which is regulated by the Care Quality Commission, will usually refer patients to their closest hospital and any scans, chemotherapy, surgery or other procedures will be funded by the NHS. Fees for writing out prescriptions are included – but not the cost of the drugs themselves. Treatments available include a pregnancy ultrasound scan for £90 and stitches for £45. My Medyk also offers dental surgery, varicose vein surgery, Botox, hypnotherapy, acupuncture and counselling sessions.

The only day it is not open until 11pm is Sunday, when it . shuts at 6pm. Julie Mess (right) a dancer working in the West End and Carmel Said, (left) a sculpture and model maker for the theatre and TV, are both patients of My Medyk Clinic . It is also cheaper than rival operators. Bupa centres offer GP services at £67.49 for a 15-minute appointment – or £225 for a full hour. Their normal surgery hours are 8.30am to 5.15pm. One My Medyk patient, a 56-year-old civil servant called Sarah, travels ten miles from her home in North London to the Hanger Lane surgery because of the ease of seeing a doctor. ‘They are open incredibly long hours which suits my lifestyle,’ she said. ‘I would recommend them to anyone, they are really friendly and professional and the costs are easily a third of what you would pay for British private care. ‘It’s difficult to get GP appointments and then you’re told you have to go and see someone else and wait more time. Would you pay £70 to see a Polish private GP whenever you want? Would you pay £70 to see a Polish private GP whenever you want? Now share your opinion . ‘If it’s going to take forever to get sorted on the NHS then in my opinion it’s worth paying for.’ Another . British patient, who did not want to be named, said the care she . received was ‘beyond comparison’ with that offered by the NHS. She . said: ‘I got an appointment when it was convenient to me and that made a . huge difference straight away. I needed physiotherapy and I didn’t want . to wait ages for an appointment. ‘I . tried the NHS but I felt like I was getting nowhere because they kept . sending me to people who said they couldn’t help me. I feel like I can . trust what they tell me at My Medyk, they work to give me what I need, . rather than make my need fit into a big system.’ A third, Carmel Said, signed up to the surgery’s dentist after his NHS dentist removed the wrong tooth. The 63-year-old, who lives in Wembley, . said: ‘I’m not going back to the NHS, as long as My Medyk is there I . will be there. Frankly the service I get there is better. Research shows that two thirds of Health Service patients have to wait more than 48 hours for a doctor¿s appointment and few slots are available outside the regular working week (file photo) ‘I’ve had lots of problems with NHS dentists, the last one I had didn’t listen to me when I told him where the pain was, he thought he knew better and he ended up removing the wrong tooth. ‘I don’t want to pay for treatment if I don’t have to but at the same time I don’t want to have problems either. They listened to me and I felt they were interested in me as a person.’ My Medyk was founded five years ago by two Polish doctors but now employs 50 staff, the majority of whom are Poles. In December, they opened a second clinic in Ealing, also in West London, and plan to open a third in East London soon. Roger Goss, of the campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘I’m not surprised this clinic is attracting so many patients.  I know people who are having to wait three weeks to get a GP appointment. ‘At my own NHS GP you normally have to wait at least a fortnight. Patients will rarely see the same doctor twice and this is particularly hard on the elderly or those with long-term conditions. ‘Every time they have an appointment they start from square one and have to explain all their illnesses and medication.’ The country’s top GP, Dr Clare Gerada, recently told MPs there were ‘queues down the street’ outside her own practice in South London which she described as ‘disgraceful’.","Despite charging £70 a visit, west London clinic already has almost 6,000 Britons on its books and offers 30-minute slots .

"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes the club's transfer ban is an 'invitation' for players from their famed youth academy to push for a place in the first team. The Catalan club have been renowned for their development of young talent through the 'Masia' since the arrival in the late 1980s of coach Johan Cruyff, who put a special emphasis on nurturing home grown players. Now they will have to rely on youth to replenish the first team after losing an appeal on Tuesday against a FIFA sanction for an alleged breach of rules on the transfer of foreign under-18 players. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is welcoming the opportunity for youth team players like Munir (left) to impress . Xavi (left) has blasted the Court of Arbitration for Sport's decision to uphold a transfer ban on Barcelona . Luis Suarez was one of five players to move to Barcelona in the summer, but they now cannot sign any more . Thomas Vermaelen followed the former Liverpool striker to the Nou Camp after leaving Arsenal in the summer . That means they are unable to buy during the coming two transfer windows. 'The decision didn't surprise us as it seemed likely, we would have preferred it to be different but that's the way it is,' Luis Enrique told a news conference. 'The squad though is sufficiently strong and this is a stimulus for the youth players. It is an invitation for them to show what they can do. 'We are a club that likes to make use of the youth system although we do supplement it by buying players and now we can take advantage of this. 'Barca B is set up to feed the first team with players and I am happy with the way things are going and what they are offering us.' Barcelona lie second in La Liga, a point behind Real Madrid, who have played a game fewer. They face a difficult test on Sunday away to David Moyes' Real Sociedad, to kick off a hectic month. Enrique complimented the attitude of the Real Sociedad players following the arrival of manager David Moyes . 'We will go there looking for three points and with plenty of determination. We have drawn against them twice and lost three times in recent years so we know what we are up against,' said Luis Enrique. 'They are now showing more drive (under Moyes) although he has only been there for a few games. They are battling and pressing more and they are looking like they can start moving up the table. 'We have four league games and four in the (King's) cup if we beat Elche so we are where we want to be at the moment. We are used to playing twice a week and we can do that now. It is important to be physically and mentally prepared after the break.'","Barcelona will not be able to buy players in the next two transfer windows .

"A bridegroom was so impressed with the venue for his lavish wedding reception that he returned in the dead of night and plundered it. Christopher Richards, 25, enjoyed a luxury champagne buffet with 90 guests following his marriage to Bridie Sparks, 24. But he later returned to the venue, broke in and stole hundreds of bottles of spirits, wine, beer and alcopops as he went on a £50,000 wrecking spree.

Last night Richards' new wife, a . mother-of-two who is pregnant with their third child, vowed to stand by . her new husband saying: 'I love him. Nobody's perfect.' Burnley Crown Court heard that the couple were married in Bacup and then went to the Bacup Hub for their reception.

'It's affected me badly, with lots of people staring at me in the street, thinking I had something to do with it.' Mrs Richards already has two children . with her husband and will give birth to their third while he is in jail. 'I just hope everything is going to be all right and that we can have . our fresh start when he gets out,' she said .

"A husband and wife who are both lawyers have been charged with two brutal stabbings that occurred on Sunday. Andrew and Alecia Schmuhl are accused of driving to the home of her 61-year-old boss in the wealthy suburb of McLean, Virginia, and stabbing him and his wife, also 61. This after Alecia was fired from her job as a corporate attorney at a nearby Arlington law firm, Bean, Kinney & Korman, where her boss Leo Fisher was a managing partner. Scroll down for video . Charged: Andrew (left) and Alecia Schmuhl (right) have been charged with stabbing her boss and his wife after Alecia was fired from her job . Alecia's boss Leo Fisher (pictured) and his wife Susan have been identified as the victims . It is alleged that Andrew knocked on the door of the $1 million home and began stabbing Mr Fisher, when he answered. Then, when Mr Fisher's wife Susan, a lawyer herself, heard a commotion and came over to see what was happening, he stabbed her as well. Mrs Fisher was able to set off an alarm luckily, which sent the couple running. Emergency responders who arrived at the home on the 900 block of Spencer Rd found the Fishers suffering from stab wounds to their upper body, and the couple was rushed to Inova Fairfax Hospital. The couple were last reported still hospitalized, according to the Fairfax Times. It is believed that Alecia then drove the two away, and an hour later police found them in their car near Interstate 95. They have both been charged with two counts each of abduction and malicious wounding in connection with the attack, and are being held without bail.

"Mick Jagger put L'Wren Scott on the insurance for the Rolling Stones tour when friends knew she was suffering from depression, it was sensationally claimed last night. In an extraordinary report The New York Post raises questions about what Mr Jagger should or could have known of his girlfriend’s struggles when he added her to the $13 million policy. The newspaper also said that Miss Scott was due to visit a psychotherapist the day she died and that she refused to take antidepressants despite apparently being advised to do so. Scroll down for video . L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses. Pictured are Jagger and Miss Scott . The Stones have launched a $13 million lawsuit against their insurers after Miss Scott hanged herself on March 17 at her luxury Manhattan apartment. They say they are entitled to the money because they had to postpone the Australia and New Zealand leg of their world tour because Mr Jagger, 71, was ‘stricken with grief’ and told not to perform for 30 days. It is unclear when Ms Scott’s name was added to the Stones’ insurance policy. The London-based group of 12 insurers however are refusing because they say Miss Scott’s death was by her own hand and not ‘unforeseen’ because she has had pre-existing mental issues. Court documents made public this week reveal that Miss Scott, who died at the age of 49, was on the long list of family members who would trigger a payout if they were injured or killed. The original insurance policy document, which the Stones signed up to, states that to the best of their knowledge 'no insured person has any physical, mental or medical condition or is undergoing any treatment, medical or otherwise, other than those advised to the insurers.' A later clause says that this does not just cover the band but also those on the list of family members, which includes Miss Scott. Veteran Post show business columnist Richard Johnson wrote that Miss Scott was so disturbed that she posted alarming images on her Facebook page in the days before she died. One of them was a photograph of Alfred Hitchcock strangling a goose which she had captioned ‘#fashionmoment’, which was deleted after her death. Her Instagram account showed a very different life, however, and featured glamorous shots of her posing on rooftops and wearing expensive clothes in far flung locations. Jagger was 'diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder' after Scott's death . Journalist Phoebe Eaton, who investigated Miss Scott’s death for GQ magazine, told the Post: ‘Her friends knew she was cripplingly depressed. ‘It’s my understanding she refused to take antidepressants.’ Miss Scott’s friend Ellen Barkin was supposedly the one who would take her to therapy the day she died. Instead the designer, who was feted by the likes of Michelle Obama, texted her British assistant Brittany Penebre to ‘come by’ to her home, which is where she found the body. It has since emerged that LS Fashions, Miss Scott’s London-based company, owed £5.4 million and had to pay £850,000 of debts within a year. She was reportedly ‘embarrassed’ by her business problems, which were so severe she had struggled to pay her staff and suppliers. When Mr Jagger found out about her death, the papers reveal that he was so upset he was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder, which can lead to nightmares and strong feelings of guilt. The Stones postponed seven dates on their 14-date On Fire tour but after adding 13 more dates they are on course to rake in a staggering £62 million for the entire operation. They sued their underwriters at the High Court in London but the insurers retaliated by claiming that it was ‘reasonable to infer Miss Scott had been suffering from a mental illness’, though they produced no proof to back this up. Such a condition was ‘traceable to, or accelerated by, a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention’, they claimed. Miss Barkin’s publicist said: ‘Ellen would never comment on this. She will always protect the privacy of L’Wren.’ Nobody for the Stones or Mr Jagger was available for comment. Court documents revealed that Jagger has 18 people on his insurance policy, including Ms Scott, Jerry Hall, seven children and four grandchildren . The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life . Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards . The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle. Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered. For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to ‘alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis’. More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either. For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with ‘alcohol abuse’ is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica. The documents show the band expected to receive £28million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth £9million.","Sensational claim that Jagger should have known his lover was 'refusing antidepressants'

"America's rich are even more well off that we originally thought, a new study has found. The top 1 percent of U.S. earners were previously estimated to control 30 per cent of the country's wealth but it seems that number could be closer to 37 per cent. A new working paper from European Central Bank senior economist Philip Vermeulen claims 30 percent is a lowball estimate of the net worth of the nation's elite because wealthier households are less likely to respond to surveys about their assets than lower-income families. Rich: Microsoft founder Bill Gates, pictured, tops the Forbes billionaires list . Vermeulen analyzed data from Forbes' billionaires lists to estimate the share of the 1 percent is in fact between 35 percent and 37 percent. 'Our knowledge of the wealth distribution is less than perfect,' Vermeulen writes in the paper. 'Our results clearly indicate that survey wealthy estimates are very likely to underestimate wealth at the top.' The Survey . of Consumer ﬁnances is the best source of information on wealth . distribution, asking questions about all asset holdings and debts of the . household. However, . a large chunk of the wealthy sample families don't respond, or only . respond in part, because they're away, too busy, or they refuse to . reveal sensitive information for example. Vermeulenfound that using the Forbe's billionaires list gave him a better idea of the jaw-dropping wealth in each country, and in turn account for that missing data. He said getting the wealth break down of the U.S. correct helps both economic researchers and policy makers as it guides fiscal policy. The paper found the U.S. was not alone in underestimating how rich its rich are. Other countries also downplayed the assets of their 1 percent, with many European nations having a significant gap between the richest household recorded by their equivalent survey and the poorest billionaire on the Forbes list. Vermeulen 's research may also suggest that the wealth controlled by the richest 5 percent in America, which was always thought to be a huge 60 percent, may also be more. The men and women on the Forbes' billionaires list have an aggregate wealth of $6.7 trillion.","The top 1 percent of U.S. earners were previously estimated to control 30 per cent of the country's wealth but it seems that number could be closer to 37 per cent .

"Some well-off New York City residents have paid $100 each for the honor of eating a candlelit holiday dinner with homeless people at a church. The Rev. Edward Sunderland says he hopes Friday's unusual mealtime coupling of haves and have-nots at St. Bartholomew's Church in Manhattan will become a trend across America. About 500 people dined at large round tables beneath the church's high ceiling. Good cause: About 500 people packed into St. Bartholomewís Church in New York on Friday for a mixer dinner of Manhattan people and the homeless . Fancy Thanksgiving: Some of the culinary staff stand near the dessert table during a holiday dinner served at St. Bartholomewís Church .

Chefs from The New York Palace and The Waldorf-Astoria hotels provided roasted turkey, buttered mashed potatoes, red velvet cake, pumpkin cheesecake and other delights. “It was magical,' Edward Sunderland, associate rector at St. Bartholomew’s, told CBS New York. 'All of our soup kitchen regulars came up to me and said how thrilled they were to have more than just a quick turkey.' 'In ordinary circumstances, people who are not hungry or homeless, don’t know how to interact with other people but if you put a really stunning meal in front of people, in a beautiful space, you give something in common.' A piano played softly in the background. Sunderland says the dinner is a chance for people to get to know each other in a safe place and for donors to see who benefits from their charitable instincts.

"The intriguing behaviour of animals across the globe from tiny ants attacking a fly to a heron catching a fish in its sharp beak has been captured by amateur photographers. The Society of Biology has announced the shortlist for its annual amateur photography competition, which includes beautiful and thought-provoking images of humans such as female farmers drying paddy and a small girl collecting water after a drought. The theme for the competition this year was 'feeding life' and it received almost 600 entries. Dinner Plate by Kristhian Castro Valencia: A plant feeds an ant through a kind of plate with food in exchange for protection creating a symbiosis between the two species, vegetable and animal . Squirrel Feast by Rebecca Condruti: This picture of a squirrel from the Grand Canyon (pictured in the background) nibbling on a piece of apple show how just a crumb of food or discarded fruit can help an animal survive . Partha Pratim Saha took a photograph of female farmers drying, cleaning and de-stoning the paddy in a rice mill in India. Rice milling is the oldest and largest agricultural processing industry in the country, where the grain is the staple food for 65 per cent of the population. Paddy in its raw form cannot be consumed by humans and needs to be processed to obtain rice. Hunting nectar by Putu Sudiarta. A . Bee is collecting the nectar of sunflower and it is possible to see pollen caught on the animal's body that helps with pollination . De-stoning by Partha Pratim Saha: Here female farmers are drying, cleaning and de-stoning paddy in a rice mill. Rice is the staple food for 65 per cent of the population in India . Rain, the source of drinking water by Khalid Rayhan Shawon: A girl is collecting rain water from the drought soil of an open field where the rain water gathers in Gabura . In contrast to the plentiful food, Khalid Rayhan Shawon captured a girl collecting rain water that had gathered over hard drought soil in Gabura in Bangladesh. While the image is a snapshot in time, it tells the bigger story of a community deprived of clean drinking water following a cyclone that saw the whole area submerged by sea water. Another photo shows fishermen in West Bengal casting their nets into water bodies created in the drought that serve as a food source to the local villages, while a different image shows a solitary fisherman in the West emptying his left-over catch after finishing work so that seagulls can enjoy leftover food, showing how nature can live in harmony with humans. Good day, bad day by Paddy Ryan: This picture shows an unfortunate minnow jumping to its death, having been caught by a blue heron, who must eat fish to survive . Feeding young by Kim Chong Keat: A mother bird hunts to provide food for her hungry chick . A number of photographers focused on the feeding habits of insects to be shortlisted in the competition, including  Putu Sudiarta who took a beautiful close-up of a bee collecting nectar from a sunflower. Another amateur photographer captured the intriguing scene of ants using a kind of natural plate growing on a plant in exchange for protection, demonstrating a symbiotic relationship between the two species. However, another image shows red ants ganging up on a fly to kill it for food as both animals struggle to survive. The Fishermen by Debdatta Chakraborty: Fishermen casting their nets in a water body, which was created in the drought prone districts of West Bengal to combat dry spells. These water bodies also serve as food suppliers to the local villages . Fight for life cycle by Bambang Setyawan: Red ants kill a fly for food that is clinging to a small circular root . Jack Settle took a photograph of a Habronattus coecatus jumping spider feasting on an insect. The spiders use their keen vision to calculate the exact distance between themselves and their prey.  At just the right moment, they will pounce on their unfortunate target and inject venom into their captured creature, effectively liquidising the insides of the prey.

"An unemployed Mexican builder faked his own kidnapping so his wife would pay his $450 ransom. Eliot Garrido Guido, 36, from Mexico City enlisted the help of his friend Carlos Amilcar Martinez Reyes, 42, to stage the kidnapping and take photographs of him tied up an gagged. Mexican authorities believe that Guido was embarrassed that his banker wife earned more money than him so worked on his devious plan. Eliot Garrido Guido from Mexico City, pictured, staged his own kidnapping to steal $450 from his wife . Reyes brought his friend to a derelict house, tied him up, sat him on a stool and took photographs of him as part of the fake kidnap plot. One of the photographs showed Guido with blood on his white tee shirt and with a gag over his mouth, while the second showed him in the same position but with a hood over his head. The images were uploaded to Guido's Facebook account, with the claim that the unemployed builder had been moved 900 miles away. According to the wife: 'When I saw the message and the photos I couldn’t believe what was happening. 'The kidnappers had demanded 7,000 Pesos ($450), and said my husband was being tortured. 'They said they would kill him if I didn’t pay up. 'I was seriously worried but when I contacted them they said I should leave the money at an address in Mexico City. 'I asked them why I should do that if they were in Playa del Carmen, and they just said do it. 'But it didn’t make sense so I contacted the police.' Police arrested Guido, left,  and his friend Carlos Amilcar Martinez Reyes, 42, right, after they were able to trace the Facebook ransom message to a derelict house just 300 metres away from Guido's home . When police arrived and examined the message they quickly discovered it had been sent from nearby after spotting the message’s location identifier. A police spokesman said: 'We found them in a house about 300 metres away. 'They both confessed and were arrested on the spot.' The men now face five years in jail.","Eliot Garrido Guido was annoyed that his wife was a higher earner than him .

"Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to say whether she voted for Barack Obama when asked about her voting history on Monday night during a debate. Grimes claimed there's 'no reluctancy' on her part to reveal her vote while asserting that she has a constitutional right not to answer questions about it. She then chided the debate moderator for having the audacity to violate the sanctity of the ballot box by pressuring her to reveal her vote. 'This is a matter of principle. Our Constitution grants, here in Kentucky, the constitutional right for privacy at the ballot box, for a secret ballot,' she told the debate's moderator, Kentucky Tonight host Bill Goodman. Obama who?: Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to say whether she voted for Barack Obama in the last two elections when pressed to reveal her vote on Monday night during a U.S. Senate debate . 'You have that right, Sen. [Mitch] McConnell has that right, every Kentuckian has that right. And as secretary of state, the chief election official, I'm tasked with overseeing and making sure that we're enforcing all of our election laws and I've worked very closely, especially with the members of our military to ensure that the privacy at the ballot box...' At that point Goodman butted in to get clarification on her position. 'So your reluctancy is a matter of principle?' he asked? 'I am not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or other side, or for members of the media. I'll protect that right for every Kentuckian.' Goodman again pressed Grimes to say whether or not she voted for Obama, but she wouldn't budge. 'Again, you have that right, Sen. McConnell has that right, every Kentuckian has the right for privacy at the ballot box. 'If I as chief election official, Bill, don't stand up for that right, who in Kentucky will?' she asked. Grimes is competing in Kentucky's Senate race this fall against incumbent McConnell, who also serves at the upper chamber's minority leader. If Republicans win a majority of seats in November, McConnell will likely become the Senate majority leader. Polls have Grimes and McConnell neck and neck and tonight was the pair's only debate against each other before the election next month. Grimes opponent, sitting Sen. Mitch McConnell, had no problem sharing his vote in both recent presidential elections during tonight's debate. McConnell said he voted for Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Both men are Republicans . Grimes has been loathe to tie herself to Obama in any way during the race, despite being a member of his political party, in order to boost her odds of getting elected in Kentucky, where the president is incredibly unpopular. Obama is less liked in Kentucky than almost anywhere in the country and has an approval rating of 29 percent there, according to a recent CNN poll. As such, Grimes likes to say she's a 'Clinton Democrat,' not an Obama Democrat, and supports the policies of former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, a former Obama administration official. Asked what the difference between a Clinton Democrat and an Obama Democrat is at tonight's debate, Grimes explained it's 'growing the middle class the right way and that's by making sure that we are building from the foundation up.' At an editorial board meeting with the Louisville Courier-Journal Grimes declined to say whether she voted for Obama in 2008 or 2012 multiples times, arguing that her vote was irrelevant because the president's name is not on the ballot. She also made the claim, as she did tonight, that she didn't need to share her vote with Kentuckians because it's private information. Grimes' vote is actually public information, assuming she was telling the truth in 2012 when she told a local newspaper that she planned to support her party's nominee, Obama, though she is unwilling to admit that now. McConnell, for one, had no problem sharing his vote in both recent presidential elections during tonight's debate, without even being asked. The Republican leader said he voted for Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Both men are Republicans. 'And by the way, in 2012, 116 out of 120 Kentucky counties agreed with my judgement that we might be in better shape now had Mitt Romney been elected,' McConnell added.","Grimes is competing in Kentucky's Senate race against incumbent Sen.

"In a strange reversal, the man who used to be responsible for keeping our Facebook information private and secure is now working for the National Security Agency, the government agency currently under scrutiny over its information-gathering practices. Max Kelly left Facebook in 2010, where he had been Chief Security Officer and headed for the NSA. Kelly's move from the world's largest social network to the world's largest spying agency suggests a commonality in the aims of both the government and Silicon Valley - acquire and exploit large amounts of personal information about Americans. Freedom and security: Former Facebook Chief Security Officer Max Kelly has spoken before about the need for increased sharing between social media companies and the military . Kelly would have been working at Facebook when the company joined the NSA's Prism program, and it seems the government is actively seeking technology and hacking experts. 'In its recruiting in Silicon Valley, the N.S.A. sends some of its most . senior officials to lure the best of the best. No less than Gen. Keith B. Alexander, . the agency’s director and the chief of the Pentagon’s Cyber Command, . showed up at one of the world’s largest hacker conferences in Las Vegas . last summer... His main purpose at Defcon, the conference, was . to recruit hackers for his spy agency,' reports The New York Times. The links between private tech companies and the government are getting closer and closer, although many companies are trying to distance themselves by saying they only hand over their customer's information when legally compelled. Career move: Max Kelly left Facebook in 2010 to work for the NSA . But The New York Times, which first reported Kelly's career move, says companies are more than willing to play along with the NSA. '…Current and former industry officials say the companies sometimes secretly put together teams of in-house experts to find ways to cooperate more completely with the NSA. and to make their customers’ information more accessible to the agency. The companies do so, the officials say, because they want to control the process themselves. They are also under subtle but powerful pressure from the NSA. to make access easier.' The line between social media companies and intelligence agencies is becoming increasingly blurred, especially now that the government is recruiting directly from Silicon Valley. The NSA is 'one of Silicon Valley’s largest customers for what is known as data analytics, one of the valley’s fastest-growing markets,' The Times reported. Share: Facebook revealed that it received between 9,000 and 10,000 requests for information on its users in the second half of 2012 . To acquire the latest technology, 'U.S. intelligence agencies invest in Silicon Valley start-ups, award classified contracts, and recruit technology experts like Mr. Kelly.' Facebook was the first social media provider to release numbers of requests for information by intelligence agents, revealing that it received between 9,000 and 10,000 U.S. requests for user data information in the second half of 2012, canvassing up to 19,000 of its users' accounts. According to The Atlantic Wire, Kelly made a speech at the Defcon hacking conference that seemed to indicate he thinks social media companies are important for defense: 'Commercial entities and the military are dealing with the same problem,' he  told the conference. 'They should both understand their roles in the larger picture. There isn’t enough information shared.' It's unclear whether Kelly's role at the NSA is directly involved in Prism, but his recruitment is a sign of even greater cooperation between social media and government security in the future.","Max Kelly left his post as Chief Security Officer at Facebook for the NSA in 2010, after having worked with the agency when Facebook joined Prism in 2010 .

"An Ohio woman is begging on the streets but she’s not homeless or desperately hungry - she wants bigger breasts. Much to the dismay of fellow beggars who desperately need money for food or a roof over their heads, the bikini-clad woman has been making money and turning heads with her plea for plastic surgery. Holding a sign that reads ‘Not homeless. Need boobs’ the woman, who only identifies herself as Chrissy, 37, has been standing on a busy street corner in Akron, Ohio. Begging for boobs: Chrissy, 37, believes her 'original' idea standing on a busy street corner will help her raise $5,058 for breast implants . Chrissy, from Rittman, Ohio, has been standing on the corner of Manchester Road and Carnegie Avenue in Akron near a blue motorbike with her sign and bodyguard. She said: ‘I see people panhandling (begging) everyday, so why not panhandle for boobs. ‘It's original. I've never seen anybody else do it.’ Placard for plastic surgery: Chrissy's friend and bodyguard Steve Bernabe (in the background) says she's being honest as motorists honk their horns and ask for photographs . Bills but not breasts: The money Chrissy earns as a bartender covers her bills and education, but not the cost of getting silicone breast implants (pictured) Chrissy believes her ‘original’ idea is proving successful after she made $46 in just two hours standing on the curb. She plans to continue begging on the intersection until she reaches $5,058. The . university student and single mother says the money she earns as a . bartender covers her bills and education costs but it’s not enough money for . breast implants. Chrissy said: ‘Everyone that knows me, knows that I am a wild one.’ There to be her bodyguard is friend Steve Bernabe, 57, of Akron, working free of charge, who says she’s not begging but being honest. He said: ‘She's just trying to move on in her life and build herself up.’ She’s attracted the attention of many motorists with some honking their horns and others requesting pictures. Tyesha Hercegovac, 27, of Ellet, took a picture of Chrissy for her husband before heading home. She said: ‘I think it's kind of ridiculous, but kind of funny in a way. ‘She wants her boobs. She's keeping it real.’ One woman was less than impressed, giving Chrissy the evil eye and a few stern words. Chrissy said: ‘He's (Mr Bernabe) just making sure I'm OK because there is some negativity out there.’","Chrissy hopes to raise $5,058 for breast implants .

"A blundering burglar who evaded police for seven years was caught after he appeared in his local paper for a 'Win a Wedding' contest. Vincent Condron, 36, was hauled back before a judge in Cardiff two weeks ago after a police officer recognised a picture of him in a copy of the South Wales Echo with his fiance Rebecca Young. Condron was originally given a 12-month community order in 2006 after being convicted of burglary and shoplifting two DVD box sets. Vincent Condron (right) was a burglar on the run for seven years until he was spotted by a police officer in his local paper with fiance Rebecca Young for a win a wedding contest . After he failed to comply with several requirements of the sentence a warrant for his arrest was issued in 2007, but he failed to turn up in court. Condron, a heroin addict, had in fact fled to Ireland in order to get clean, before studying at a college in Dublin. Condron has been sentenced to a community order in 2006 for burglary and shoplifting but had failed to comply (file picture) He then returned to Cardiff, found love, and now has plans to set up his own business. Yesterday Judge Judge Eleri Rees sentenced Condron to 28 days in prison, but having already spent 14 days in custody since his arrest, he was expected to be released within hours. During those two weeks Judge Rees assessed evidence about how Condron had turned his life around. Defending him, David Leathley said: 'His father can confirm that he went to the counselling sessions with him and he has returned clean.' 'He did go to Ireland in 2007 but it was at a time when he was hopelessly addicted to heroin and that was the key to his offending. 'He knew he couldn’t beat it in Cardiff where there were dealers he owed money and who had his cards marked. He fled for his own safety and sought the help he needed.' Condron is due to resit the last of his exams next summer and sees his future in holistic medicine, Mr Leathley said. The couple’s testimony in the Echo competition said: 'We met at Christmas 2011 through family. Despite the distance between Dublin and Cardiff we maintained daily contact through the internet and saw each other as often as we could. We fell in love.

"Luis Figo is proposing an expansion of the World Cup finals as part of his FIFA presidential manifesto which launched at Wembley Stadium on Thursday. The tournament's current format involves 32 teams but Figo wants to add eight or 16 more, with a focus on more teams from outside of Europe getting to the finals stage.

'I believe we should consider proposals to expand the competition to a 40 or even 48 team World Cup,' Figo told the press conference at Wembley. 'Both these options are feasible with an extra three to four days of tournament play. If this expansion were to take place I believe that additional teams should come from non-European nations.' Figo, who played in two World Cup finals with Portugal, also offered up the option of the tournament being played on more than one continent in future. The former Barcelona and Real Madrid star suggested that FIFA could even stage two 24-team group competitions simultaneously on the two continents before the knockout stages would be held in one country.

"A man who was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of cancer two years ago is now amazingly in remission thanks to a revolutionary treatment that involved receiving an infusion of the virus that causes AIDS. Marshall Jensen of Utah, was one of 30 leukemia patients to undergo a trial treatment at Penn Medicine recently, in which white blood cells are implanted with a harmless form of HIV programmed to target and kill cancer. The 30-year-old married father of one has so far responded well to the treatment and is now cancer-free for the first time in years. Scroll down for video . Cancer free: Marshall Jensen's (right) leukemia is in remission after receiving a breakthrough cancer treatment that involved the HIV virus. Pictured above with wife Amanda (left) and their son Kezman (center) The 30-year-old Utah man was one of 30 patients in an experimental trial, who received doses of the deactivated HIV virus, which act as cancer killing fighters in the body. Of those who underwent of the treatment, 23 are still alive and 19 are now in remission . Jensen, wife Amanda and their young son Kezman have been travelling the country ever since he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012, just one year after their marriage, searching for an effective treatment for his cancer. 'They were a young couple. They weren’t married very long. They had a brand new little baby when all of this started,' neighbor Lindsay Wright told KSL. The Jensens didn't find success though until they met Dr Carl June at Penn Medicine. Dr June and his team of physicians have spent two decades working on a breakthrough experimental treatment using the HIV virus. On Thursday, Jensen was welcomed back to his Utah neighborhood, after travelling the U.S. these past two years for treatment . Jensen (center) and his wife Amanda (left) are pictured above with Dr Carl June, who led the gene therapy trial at Penn Medicine . 'We were calling it our Hail Mary pass,' Marshall Jensen said. 'It felt right. … We didn't know how we were going to get out there, what we were going to do, but it worked. By God's grace I was able to come back.' On Thursday, a healthier Jensen returned to his neighborhood in Utah to a surprise homecoming celebration. The connection between leukemia and HIV was first discovered in 2006, when an HIV-positive man named Timothy Ray Brown was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After receiving a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation, Brown's cancer went into remission and the HIV disappeared from his system making him the first man to ever be fully cured of the virus. Dr June is now looking to use the treatment to combat other types of cancer. Jensen (right) pictured above with his wife (left) and their son (center) Since then, Dr June and his team have been working vigilantly on developing a HIV-based treatment for leukemia and this October, published a study showing the therapy's success on 30 cancer patients. The patients who received the treatment had billions of T-cells extracted from their body, which were taken to a lab and implanted with deactivated HIV. The 'serial killer' cells are then put back into the body to fight and kill cancer, and remain dormant until the cancer reappears. While the idea of receiving a dose of HIV may seem scary to some, Dr June says there's nothing to fear about the stripped-down virus used in the treatment. 'It's a disabled virus, but it retains the one essential feature of HIV, which is the ability to insert new genes into cells,' Dr June explained. Of the 30 leukemia patients who received the treatment, comprised of five adults and 25 children, 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission. Seven-year-old Emma Whitehead was the first child to receive the treatment in 2012, and has been cancer-free for two years now. Dr June and his team are now looking at using the HIV treatment to attack other forms of cancers, and will be starting trials this summer for pancreatic cancer patients. Seven-year-old Emily Whitehead was the first child who underwent the experimental T-cell treatment in 2012 (left). She is still cancer-free two years later (right)","Marshall Jensen was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012 and has spent the last two years searching for an effective treatment .

"Forget teeth whitening or veneers, women in Senegal are their quest for beautiful smiles to extreme levels - by tattooing their gums black. Women in the west African country say their ancestors have been doing it for years and claim as well as giving a whiter smile, the procedure also protects the gums and stops bad breath. The procedure was not well known internationally until recently when a video emerged showing a woman called Mariéme who goes under the needle. Scroll down for video . Seven layers of the mixture are pricked into the gums with a needle . The woman's gums are tattooed with a mixture of burnt oil and shea butter . The tattooist said black gums and a silver tooth are more attractive than red gums . More than 17,000 people have watched Mariéme endure the painful process online. Mariéme said she had became 'obsessed' with the idea of getting her gums tattooed in order to achieve the perfect smile. She pays a woman, who works from her family home, just 80p to tattoo a combination of burnt oil and shea butter into her gums. The mixture is at first pressed onto her gums before a needle is repeatedly pricked into it. VIDEO  Not for the squeamish. Senegalese women get agonising gum tattoos . Mariéme bears the pain at first, she is seen pushing the tattooist away in tears when the agony becomes too much. With the black mixture smeared across her mouth and face, Mariéme is only able to have four of the seven layers she originally intended. She tells the interviewer: 'It hurts. I would never recommend this torture to anyone.' However, despite the pain she later says she is more than happy with the results.

The tattooist said the practice has . been done for years in Senegal among women and even men in some tribes . have their gums tattooed, although she admits woman are less interested . these days. She said: 'Women should not have red gums. Her whole smile needs to be enchanting. A nice smile attracts men.'

"A heavily pregnant woman has been caught on camera hitting her baby bump with a hammer to prove how ‘hard’ her unborn child is. Heather Thorpe, 24, was filmed by her former partner, Sean Hanlon, striking herself with the claw hammer around a month before giving birth to her son, Jonathon. But when Mr Hanlon, 26, showed the video to police, officers refused to press charges, insisting no offence had been committed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Swing: Heavily-pregnant Ms Thorpe brings the hammer into contact with her belly . Contact: The tool thuds against her. Police have been shown the video but refuse to act . Yesterday Mr Hanlon said he was . appalled at the police’s decision, adding: ‘If there was a film of . someone hitting a baby with a hammer they would be in handcuffs in ten . seconds flat.’ Mr Hanlon . shot the five-second video in the couple’s living room in October last . year, just weeks before Miss Thorpe’s due date. Unharmed: Mother Thorp with her baby son Jonathon - who was healthy, normal baby when he was born . He said he had been filming her on his iPhone when she told him: ‘My baby’s hard as anything – just watch this.’ He . then began filming her as she walked over to his toolbox. The short . clip shows Miss Thorpe lifting up her top to reveal her  baby bump. She . then grabs the steel claw hammer and hits the side of her stomach twice, . apparently not caring about the harm that could be inflicted on her . unborn infant. He said she had also punched herself before because ‘she wanted the baby to come out’. Mr Hanlon, a security guard from Lea Village, Birmingham, said: ‘I was completely shocked, but Heather didn’t seem to care. ‘I asked her what the hell she was doing but she just told me to stop over-reacting. Jonathon was born and he was OK.’ The . couple later separated and Miss Thorpe went to police, accusing Mr . Hanlon of domestic violence. When officers knocked on his door last . December he told them she was lying, and handed over the footage he had . shot as evidence of her character. Mr . Hanlon added: ‘I couldn’t believe it when the police didn’t press . charges.

"Following the viral success of the Goat Simulator earlier this year, a designer from New York has created a similar game especially for dog lovers. Dog Park lets players simulate being a virtual canine and the goal is to chase and dig holes with other dogs. It is still in an early development stage and is expected to be fully unveiled at September’s No Quarter event in New York. Dog Park (pictured) lets players simulate being a virtual canine and the goal is to chase and dig holes with other dogs. It is still in an early development stage and is expected to launch at September’s No Quarter event at New York University's Game Centre . The game is the brainchild of New Yorker Kevin Cancienne. A recent study found three quarters of people in a relationship with someone who regularly plays role-playing games wish their partner would pay them more attention. Researchers from Brigham Young University discovered the amount of time it takes to play the games, as well as the development of virtual relationships, were blamed for break-ups. Other players were found to have had affairs with people they'd met while playing the games. However, couples that played role-playing games together said it had strengthened their relationship. He told Kill Screen Daily: ‘Dog Park is a pretty big departure for me. 'Not only is it in a genre and format I haven't worked in much, but I’ve let the free-flowing qualities I appreciate about dog play come through.’ He continued that he didn’t want the game to be about competition, and the only goal is to ‘keep on having more fun’. Cancienne regularly tweets teaser screenshots from test versions of the game, and is expected to reveal more as the No Quarter event approaches. No Quarter is an annual event that takes place at New York University’s Game Centre. Dog Park is yet another example of animal simulators that appear to be taking the web by storm. The game is the brainchild of New Yorker Kevin Cancienne. He said he he didn't want the game to be about competition, and the only goal is to 'keep on having more fun'. Cancienne regularly tweets teasers screenshots (pictured) from test versions of the game . Goat Simulator (pictured) is a third-person game in which players take control of a goat. They can roam the game's virtual world, run, jump, and headbutt objects and people. They can also lick items which stick to the goat's tongue and can be thrown. It was developed by Swedish-based Coffee Stain Studios . In April, the Goat Simulator launched on Steam and let players explore a virtual world through the eyes of the farmyard creature. Its popularity surprised many, and was closely followed by a Bear Simulator that achieved Kickstarter funding in less than a week. As the name suggests, Goat Simulator is a third-person game in which players take control of a goat. They can roam the game's virtual world, run, jump, and headbutt objects and people, as well as lick items which stick to the goat's tongue and can be thrown. It was developed by Swedish-based Coffee Stain Studios. In March, Oregon-based Farajay Studios launched a Kickstarter campaign asking for funding for a Bear Simulator, pictured. It is a first-person game that lets players 'do bear things', including exploring, eating fish and plants and sleeping. The campaign hit its target funding within a week . Recreation therapist William Hawkes-Robinson said benefits of playing simulators include stronger reading skills, mathematics, creative thinking, cooperative play, and other creative skills. He continued: 'There are very few social table-top recreation activities available that are cooperative rather than competitive in nature. 'Role-playing gaming is, by design, a cooperative past time, which in and of itself may have significant benefits in the world where everything is becoming competitive at all ages and levels of society.' However, players can also become too involved in the game, and invest too much time emotionally to a character to the detriment of real relationships. This can lead someone to feel isolated, or develop existing negative feelings such as low self-esteem.","The game was created by New York designer Kevin Cancienne .

"Joanne Berry, 30, posed on websites such as Cougar Shag declaring she liked role play . A woman today told of her terror when a stranger burst into her home, saying he was there to carry out 'a fantasy rape' on her. Joanne Berry, 30, from Grove Park, south-east London, is accused of arranging for the woman, her work colleague, to be ‘raped’ by men she tricked on online sex chat rooms. No rape took place but the men she duped into going to the alleged victim’s home were led to believe she would willingly participate in such a fantasy, the court heard. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described how she was at home on April 29, 2012, when she heard a bang on the front door. She told a jury at Maidstone Crown Court: 'I opened the door and there was a male there that I didn’t recognise. 'He asked if I was (the victim’s name) and I said yes. 'And the next thing I knew he had pushed the door open and was trying to force his way into my property. 'I had my hand on the door and I was pushed back. I was absolutely petrified. 'My sister was in the house and I just screamed for help.' She said when the man, Dean Hicks, heard her scream he looked 'startled' and asked her, ‘Is this a wind up?’ She told the court: 'He said he had been chatting to someone on the internet who he believed was me. 'He said the person wanted him to come to the property and carry out a fantasy rape by knocking on my front door and then trying to push his way in. 'He said once he had carried out the ""rape"" he was to get information about Joanne Berry from me. 'That’s when I thought she must be behind it. He said he was told a password to make sure that I was the right person. 'The password was ""feathers"". 'I told Joanne once that whenever I see a white feather I always think of my grandparents, like they are my guardian angels.' The woman said Mr Hicks told her she should phone the police, who came to see her later that day. He told court how he went to meet the alleged victim for 'kinky sex' but was horrified when he realised they had both been set up and that she . was not expecting him. Maidstone Crown Court heard he had chatted with a woman on a . website called Cougar Shag and that she had told him she liked . 'dominant' sex and 'rape'. When Berry was arrested her computer was found to contain conversations with several men describing violent rape fantasies . Cougar: Berry used websites such as Cougar Shag (pictured) to set up the 'rape' Mr Hicks said when he first knocked on the door of the address he was given there was no answer.' I went back to the car, I messaged her saying ""this isn't right, . what's going on?"" She said ""well knock again, shout, knock louder, make . a scene, make it like you're really angry"".' Mr . Hicks told the jury that after returning to his car and messaging the . woman - said to be Berry - she told him 'the curtains are moving, you . can see me'. He added: 'I went . back to the door and this time somebody answered. She opened the door . six inches and I put my foot on the step. 'A woman said ""what do you want?"". I saw her face and I knew the poor girl was scared witless. 'She looked pure panic stricken, that is not what I was expecting. I was expecting a wink or a nod to carry on.' Mr Hicks said he returned to his car again and messaged the woman (allegedly Berry) for a second time, asking what was going on. He said this time he got a confused reply. 'It was the first time I'd gone to meet up with someone I've been . talking to online,' he said. 'I guess I was hoping to get sex at the end of it. I . suppose I was groomed, that's the way it felt.' Mr Hicks said he returned to the alleged victim's house later that day - April 29, 2012 - with a letter of apology. She . told him she would call the police and he said 'yes, please do' and . waited in his car for three hours until officers turned up. He . said he gave the police the log-in details for the Cougar Shag website . but they didn't follow it up straight away and by the time they did, . three months later, the relevant messages had been deleted. Earlier the woman told the court how Berry had confided in her in March 2012 that she had been raped by two men. She said Berry would send her up to 12 texts a day and she had tried to support her and encouraged her to go to the police. Maidstone Crown Court in Kent (pictured) heard that she arranged for men to go round to (the victim's) house and rape her . She said: 'She kept mentioning her dead sister saying that I reminded her of her. As time went on it made me feel uncomfortable. 'I was beginning to think that she was substituting me for her sister.' On April 13, 2012, the victim received a text message from Berry implying she was going to kill herself. Concerned, the woman alerted police but then became angry when Berry gave police a false address. She told the court: 'I was angry and disappointed in what she had done. I said to her that she needed professional help and I needed to step back from the situation. 'I realised she had no intention of killing hersef. That was all about attention.' The woman told her manager at work what had happened and Berry was sent home. The alleged victim said: 'She blamed me for it. She texted me and said she had thought she could trust me.' She told the court about a further incident on May 23, 2012, when a man approached her on her driveway as she arrived home from work at 5.45pm. She said: 'He asked if I was (victim’s name). I just knew what it was about. I panicked and told him to get the hell away from me. 'He said ""I’m not here to hurt you"". 'He said he had been on a chat line talking to someone he believed was me and I had invited him round. 'He said it was called UK Chat. I absolutely panicked. I got indoors as soon as I could and I locked the door and phoned the police. I thought he had it in mind to rape me.' Berry is charged with putting the victim in fear of violence, committing an offence of assault with the intent of committing a relevant sexual offence, the common assault of the victim and attempting to cause the victim to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The prosecution claims Berry committed the offences by procurement. Berry, a temporary office administrator, denies all four charges. The trial continues.

"Hundreds of people are calling for adverts featuring England football players to be pulled after being knocked out at the group stage of the World Cup. Supporters are furious that players including Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Joe Hart are still being shown on their screens despite their embarrassing performance. Hundreds have taken to Twitter to vent their anger and are demanding the adverts are pulled. Scroll down to see the adverts . Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck are still being shown on screens in TV adverts . Ironic: The Mars advert features Steven Gerrard booting the ball into the back of the net . One fan posted on the social media network: 'Just woke up and turned TV on to the Mars advert with Gerrard scoring with an overhead kick. Is that some kind of sick joke?' Another wrote: 'There is something that winds me up now seeing an England player in a TV ad. Not inclined to buy Doritos or a Subway any time soon.' While another tweeted a message to ITV which read: 'An idea for you. Don't show ads with England players in just after we've been rogered in the World Cup for the 2nd time in a week.' Hart stars in a number of adverts including Gillette and Head & Shoulders, Carlsberg and Doritos. Mars has revealed its advert starring Danny Welbeck, Sturridge and Gerrard will not be shown on TV screens from next week. One fan posted on the social media network: 'Just woke up and turned TV on to the Mars advert with Gerrard scoring with an overhead kick. Is that some kind of sick joke?' The clip shows Gerrard booting the ball into the back of the net which has particularly annoyed fans. A Mars Chocolate UK spokeswoman said: 'We are an Official supporter of the England team and continue to back the team and the fans. 'Our partnership with the FA is about more than just the big tournaments and together we're looking to get 1 million adults back in to football over the next four years. 'Our campaign this tournament has been about rewarding the fans with the chance to win one of 500,000 limited edition England shirts and also offering free 'Just Play' football sessions which give the fans the chance to get out and have a kick about themselves right through to the end of the tournament.' The hopes and dreams of England fans were left in ruins after Costa Rica upset the odds by beating Italy 1-0. In their worst performance in the tournament since 1958 - losses to Italy and Uruguay in their first two fixtures mean they will be leaving Brazil before the knockout stages. Hart stars in a number of adverts including Gillette and Head & Shoulders (pictured) and Doritos . Bryan Ruiz's 44th minute header led Costa Rica to a shock 1-0 win against the Italians. A victory for Italy would have given England a glimmer of hope going into their final fixture - but the result leaves it mathematically impossible for them to qualify. The nation has spent months watching football-themed adverts, seeing streets and shops taken over by St George's flags, and hearing hours of punditry explaining why this could be England's year. Twenty-five million fans cheered on England during the crunch showdown. However, it is believed England's World Cup failure could put a £1.3billion hole in the economy. With three weeks of the tournament still to go, England crashing out at the group stages will hit the high street. Daniel Sturridge who scored against Italy in England's first game is the star of the Subway advert . Goalkeeper Joe Hart appears in a number of adverts including this one for Gillette shaving foam . Experts said making it to the last 16 would have given shops, pubs and restaurants a massive boost worth £2.58billion. According to figures from VoucherCodes.co.uk, each England goal triggered a £198.5million spending spree. However, England paraphernalia will most probably be available at reduced prices. Reaction: Football fans have taken to Twitter to vent their anger at the adverts featuring England football stars . In 2010, when England were knocked out in the second round of the World Cup, shares across the main pub companies had plunged almost eight per cent on average, after three days of trading. Yesterday, goalkeeper Joe Hart and forward Wayne Rooney apologised for their early exit. Rooney told fans he was 'sorry' in contrast to when he responded to booing fans during the last World Cup which ended with him ranting on TV. Wayne Rooney posted on Twitter that he was sorry to all the fans that had travelled and watched at home . Meanwhile, Hart said: 'I can't thank people enough for making this trip to Brazil, for making the efforts at home, for staying with us. If I wasn't here myself I would be doing the same. I can speak on behalf of the lads that we've left nothing to chance, we have tried everything.' Rooney write in his Facebook page: 'Absolutely devastated to be out of the World Cup. 'Going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn't worked out. 'Sorry to all the fans who travelled and at home that we haven't done better... gutted!'","Hundreds have taken to Twitter to vent their anger .

"At the World Cup opening ceremony on Thursday, a paraplegic will leave behind their wheelchair to take to the pitch in this robotic suit . The most impressive kick of the World Cup won't come from a known football star. Instead, it will be from a paraplegic teenager who will use a robotic bodysuit to kick a ball using his or her mind. For the past few months, Brazilian doctor Miguel Nicolelis has been putting the final touches to  the futuristic exoskeleton, which was designed to enable paralysis victims to walk. At the World Cup opening ceremony on Thursday in . Sao Paulo, a paraplegic - whose identity has been kept secret - will . leave behind their wheelchair to take to the pitch in the suit. The exoskeleton, which has been designed as part of the international 'Walk Again Project', will use motorised metal braces to support and bend the teenager’s legs. The suit itself will be controlled by . patterns of brain activity detected by electrodes placed either on the . scalp or in the brain itself.

The teenager had undergone training in a virtual reality . simulator to translate thoughts into signals to the robotic armour. ‘Doing a demonstration in a stadium is something very much outside our routine in robotics. It's never been done before.’ Dr Nicolelis said his team have barely left the lab since March, when they arrived in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and economic hub, to make the final preparations. But it's been rewarding, too, he said, recalling the moment on 24 April when a paralysed user first took steps in the exoskeleton. Dr Nicolelis’ voice contains a mix of exhaustion and excitement, the result of 30 years' work, more than 200 scientific papers and countless clinical tests that are nearing a spectacular summit. The scientist started down this path in 1984 when he wrote his doctoral thesis on neural connections in muscular control. He said the idea for the suit came to him in 2002, when scientists were just beginning to explore robotic exoskeletons. The team have named the device the . Bra-Santos Dumont, a combination of the three-letter sporting code for . Brazil and Alberto Santos-Dumont, a Brazilian inventor who once . demonstrated controllable flight was possible by flying his dirigible . around the Eiffel Tower.

The teenager will wear an exoskeleton, artists' illustration pictured, that will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected . Some scientists have criticised Dr Nicolelis for ditching academic publications in favour of mass media - he posts research updates on Facebook - and the anonymity of the lab for the lights of the World Cup stage. Critics have also questioned the practicality of his research and accused him of hogging an unfair share of the Brazilian government's research budget. Dr Nicolelis rejects that criticism. ‘The funding is the same with or without the World Cup,’ he said. ‘We've received $14 million (£8.4 million) from the Brazilian government over the last two years. ‘That's approximately four or five times less than what the United States government invests in a mechanical arm.’ ‘I don't see anything wrong with demonstrating a technology for the whole world that has a humanitarian objective and was paid for by civil society,’ he added. More than 65,000 people will be in Sao Paulo's Corinthians Arena to watch the BRA-Santos Dumont's first steps in public before Brazil play Croatia in the opening match. Around a billion are expected to watch on TV. Brazilian scientist Miguel Nicolelis (centre) working in his lab in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

"When Gower College lecturer Calvin Williams fell from a cliff 50 feet (15 metres) high in 2004, he feared his love of mountain biking might be over. With extensive leg injuries that would confine him to a wheelchair for a year, he realised there were other similar people in his position who were unable to ride a standard two-wheeled mountain bike. So he decided to design and build a bike with four wheels that could be ridden by disabled people, and the fruits of his labour are now starting to materialise. Scroll down for video . Gower College engineering lecturer Calvin Williams (pictured) has designed and built a four-wheeled mountain bike known as Project Enduro. He decided to start the project, giving disabled people the chance to mountain bike, after falling from a cliff and suffering leg injuries in 2004 . His endeavour is called Project Enduro, an initiative supported by the Welsh Government through European Regional Development Funding. Called the Juggernaut, this $2500 (£1,500) bike can ride with ease across snow and ice, and also across curbs and steps. The father and son inventors claim its two front wheels give the bike far more stability. The idea . came from experiencing the challenges of carrying a surfboard on a bike . with a surf rack to a local surf break and having to dismount to push . the bike up stairs and through deep sand, the firm said. The company experimented with several designs, and now Rungu Trikes roll through deep sand and up short flights of stairs. Enduro has the goal of designing and manufacturing a prototype four-wheeled mountain bike. This is predominantly for use by disabled people – although it seems others aren’t disqualified from enjoying the bike either. The bike, a collaboration with Swansea Metropolitan University, is ‘powered’ by gravity alone. It has no pedals, with the ‘rider’ instead sitting in a seat between all four wheels. A set of handlebars then allows them to steer as they make their way down a course. The bike is built with carbon-fibre seating and top-end suspension. Its aim is to encourage extreme sports enthusiasts to grasp the concept of ‘gravity biking’ – cycling at top speeds downhill. The . first prototype was unveiled back in February, and the team have now . been testing a second prototype in Snowdonia, north Wales. The second builds upon the design, comfort and safety issues identified in the first. And Project Enduro is beginning to make an impact on the extreme sports market. Mountain bikers make their way down Snowdon led by Phill Hall with the four-wheeler mountain bike in north Wales. The prototype four wheeler bicycle is believed to be only the second-ever manufactured in the world . It’s believed that innovations such as these will continue to lead the way for the future development of both bike manufacturing and healthcare products for disabled people. And the goal is now to officially launch the product, which is built entirely in Wales, onto the market by December 2014. ‘The project is developing well beyond our initial aspirations,’ said Williams. ‘As time goes on more trails are becoming available to ride the bikes and we are having enquiries from potential riders from across the world. ‘Hopefully we will see a race series soon, where able bodied and disabled athletes will be competing head to head at Welsh trail centres.’ Project Enduro is an endeavour to design and manufacture a  bike predominantly for use by disabled people. Pictured from left to right are Project Manager Calvin Williams, Phill Hall of the Rough Riderz Club, Emyr Davies (World Cup downhill rider) and Project Supporter Leyton on the summit of Snowdon .","A team of engineers in Wales have designed a four-wheeled bike .

"Smiling and waving, Ebola victim Sontay Massaley leaves a treatment centre in Liberia after being given the all-clear for the disease. The mother-of-three, a vendor at an outdoor market, was given little chance of survival when she had arrived at the medical centre eight days ago, but has now been allowed to return to her family in Paynesville. Ebola kills around 70 per cent of those who become infected, and yesterday the World Heath Organisation announced that the death toll in west Africa has passed 4,000, so Sontay knows she is one of the lucky few. Liberia's crumbling health service is already struggling to cope with the flood of Ebola cases, and with health workers set to walk out at midnight tomorrow in a strike over pay and conditions, cases like Sontay's could become even rarer. Going home: Sontay Massaley, a mother-of-three from Liberia, leaves an Ebola treatment centre after being given the all-clear . Lucky: She was given little chance of survival when she arrived at the centre eight days ago as Ebola kills 70 per cent of those infected . Losing battle: However cases like Sontay's could become even rarer as Liberian health workers threaten to walk from tomorrow night demanding better pay and conditions, and more safety equipment . Nurses and doctors working in Ebola treatment centres say they are not being provided with enough safety gear, and are demanding better pay and working conditions. Talks with the government today ended with officials refusing to meet the workers' demands, and if nothing changes by midnight tomorrow, then hundreds of patients could be left without care. 'The government of Liberia has not changed their posture. They do not want to engage us so that we can talk,' Williams said. 'Time is running out, by 1200 midnight on Monday morning, we will be starting the go-slow action.' Liberia's deputy health minister Matthew Flomo said the government was not aware of health workers planning to strike. 'What I do know is that the government has reached an agreement with health workers for their payment, which will be as of September, beginning Monday,' Flomo said. But Williams denied the workers had reached any agreement with the government. He accused the administration of trying to divide the workers. Deadly: More than 2,000 people have already died in Liberia, among them 95 health workers. If medical centre staff do walk out tomorrow, it will potentially leave thousands of Ebola patients without care . Happy: Sontay poses with a photographer at the medical centre. The mother-of-three, a market vendor, will now be allowed to go home . 'The problem is the government. The public should get angry with the government, not with us,' Williams said . 'The public is aware that health workers are dying because they are not protected. Nobody is supposed to die while protecting lives, we have been calling on the government to give us protective gear but they are not doing so,' he said. Liberia has the highest number of infections and deaths of the worst outbreak of the viral haemorrhagic fever that has killed 2,316 people in the poor West African nation. A lack of education among the population, and denial about the spread of Ebola, often leads to populations in slums turning against Ebola teams sent to retrieve dead bodies, or treat Ebola patients, as people falsely believe it is the doctors who are bringing the disease in. Healthcare systems in Liberia as well as in Sierra Leone and Guinea, where the outbreak was first recorded in March, have been overwhelmed by the epidemic. The disease has also spread to Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the United States. Celebration: Staff at a medical centre cheer as patients who are now free of Ebola are checked before leaving. But a threatened walk-out by some workers tomorrow threatens to spread the disease even further . Concern that Ebola could spread globally has prompted international organisations and the international community to step up support for the affected countries with medical personnel, material and pledges of about $1billion to tackle the epidemic. But healthcare workers in Liberia complain they are still working without basic protective clothing and are not receiving adequate compensation while many of them have contracted and died from the disease. Over 4,000 people have died from Ebola including 233 health care workers, among them 95 from Liberia and the same number from Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization.","Sontay Massaley, a market vendor, smiles as she leaves treatment centre after being given all-clear for deadly virus .

"She is the perfect person to ask to come and sing at a New Year party due to her love of all things festive. So it’s no surprise that Mariah Carey was invited to come and end the year on a high note at a party which was believed to be hosted by one of the Sultan of Brunei’s sons on Tuesday evening. Her performance has however raised eyebrows as it comes just a couple of weeks after she came under fire for being paid $1 million to perform for Angolan President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos. Diva: Mariah wore a glamorous white gown emblazoned with rhinestones, and a pair of long white gloves . In early December her decision to put on a two hour show for the dictator angered human rights groups who allege Dos Santos has murdered many and exploited the country's resources to his own gain. That concert came five years after Mariah apologized after performing for notorious dictator Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was toppled and killed during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011. A spokesperson for Mariah has been contacted about her decision. But joined by her husband Nick Cannon and gorgeous twins Monroe and Morocco, the 43-year-old pulled out all the stops wearing a low-cut silver frock at the lavish event held at the Dorchester Hotel, unconcerned about ruffling any feathers. Sign star: Mariah took to the stage to entertain the guests on New Year's Eve . And it seems the look went down particularly well with 33-year-old Nick who was well and truly sprung when he was captured on film looking captivated by Mariah's more than ample assets as the couple waited to ring in the new year. The singer shared the picture on Instagram captioning it: 'Happy New Year!!!! ""You like this and you know it.''' The dress was embellished with silver studs and making it even more Hollywood glam, the Hero singer added a pair of long sparkly opera gloves. Funny moment: Mariah posted this photo to her Instagram account on New Year's Eve with the caption, 'Happy New Year!!!! ""You like this and you know it""' Making sure to draw even more attention to her ample bosom, the star wore a stunning diamond necklace that came to a point at the end just at the top of her cleavage. Mariah was able to get away from her husband long enough to enjoy a hug from the other special man in her life - son Moroccan. The two-year-old, who was dressed up in an adorable - and very dapper - tux, gave his mother a big kiss. Pucker up: Mariah's son Morocco gave her a big kiss good luck ahead of her performance . While the little boy dressed like his father, Mariah's daughter showed she too had a passion for glam fashion like her mother . Monroe also wore an all white ensemble featuring a glittery dress with pink bow and a white fur jacket. The well-dressed family looked right at home amongst the impressive guestlist which included the likes of Jerry Hall, Bianca Jagger and A-list actor John Travolta. Jet-setting: Mariah Carey was seen in London on Wednesday night, alongside husband Nick Cannon, daughter Monroe, and record producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri . Brrrr! The four were bundled up substantially as they braved the cold . Amid free-flowing champagne and specially-sourced foods the guest mingled before being entertained by Mariah and Diana Ross who capped the evening with a live show on either side on the midnight countdown. Mariah, who performed a number of tracks as part of her headline set which was described as 'rousing', was preceded by former Supremes star Diana Ross, who performed a rendition if I Will Survive. Following the extravagant bash Mariah emerged on Wednesday evening alongside husband Nick, daughter Monroe, and record producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. The four were bundled up substantially as they braved the cold.  Mariah . was very fashionable and colour-coordinated in a light brown knit . sweater, dark brown knit scarf, brown suede high-heeled boots, and brown . leggings. Stylin: The 43-year-old singer was very fashionable and colour-coordinated in a light brown knit sweater, dark brown knit scarf, brown suede high-heeled boots, and brown leggings . Ringing in the new year: The We Belong Together singer performed the night before at a New Year's Eve party in London's Dorchester Hotel . Nick was of course much more casual in a bright orange snow jacket, a gray hoodie . with the hood up, gray sweatpants, and black sneakers as he smiled at the camera. Mariah . carried two-year-old Monroe in her arms and appeared to have styled her . little girl with care - pinning white flower ribbons in her hair and . dressing her in a chic little coat and brown boots. Prior . to London, Mariah enjoyed an extended stay in Aspen, Colorado with . Nick, Monroe, and Monroe's fraternal twin brother, Moroccan. Winter Wonderland: Mariah posted this festive photo of her, 33-year-old Nick, and two-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan in Aspen on Christmas day .

"For Richard Sherman, the fall out and vile racist abuse the Seattle Seahawk lineman faced is by far not the hardest challenge he has had to overcome. Sherman, the hottest name in American sport right now after he secured the Seahawks' place in the Super Bowl with a sensational last minute interception, has had to fend off claims he is unsporting after he went on an aggressive tirade in a post-match interview. But to those who know him and where he is from, he personifies the 'American Dream' come true. Scroll down for video . Reformed: Kevin Sherman told MailOnline how he would show his children the scars from being shot twice in the chest when he was a gangster. He is now a garbage man and spoke to MailOnline about his family's story . Against the odds: Richard as a child. His father says his upbringing has given him the passion to succeed that was so misunderstood by football fans shocked at his rant after the game on Sunday . What has been lost in the sound and bluster of the last few days is how Sherman, 25, has achieved fame and fortune against all the odds. He was brought up in the city of Compton, south of Los Angeles, notorious for its gangs such as the Bloods and the Crips. His . best friend – and high school football teammate - was killed in a . shooting and his elder brother Branton, 28, went to jail for drug . dealing. Even his father was once a gang member before turning his life around after being shot twice in the chest. All this experience was turned to Sherman’s advantage making him even more determined to succeed, his family said. 'My son is misunderstood,' said his father Kevin Sherman, 49, a refuge collector, in an interview with the MailOnline. Tragedy: Richard Sherman, right, with his friend, Marcus Peters, left, who was shot dead in gang crossfire. They were high school teammates . Proud and supportive: Beverley and Kevin Sherman brushed off any criticism of their son Richard after his brash rant on live television on Sunday night . Drive: Mr Sherman told MailOnline: 'Richard was very upset but he used what happened as motivation. He used it to make himself the best man that he could ever be' 'He plays football at a high intensity but off the field you could not meet a better person. He is a well-spoken and upstanding citizen who takes real pride in himself. He just has the kind of passion you need to make it from where he is from.' That passion, so evident in his post-match interview with Erin Andrews, drove him not only making it as a footballer on the verge of a Super Bowl but also to graduate from Stanford, one of America’s most prestigious universities. Sitting in his home in Compton, Mr Sherman said that he and his wife Beverly, 50, were determined Richard, Branton and their daughter Krystina, 22, a hairdresser, would not make the same mistakes as him. He often showed them the scars from two gunshot wounds he received as teenager as a deterrent to keep them out of trouble. 'I made sure that my children did not go down the path that I went down,' he said. 'This is a rough area and it was even rougher then.  I ran with the wrong people. 'I went to jail for anti-social behavior. I was playing truant. One day I was sitting on a porch with some gang members when another gang tried to kill them. Sherman gives the camera some 'crazy eyes' after insulting 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree . Bonus: to his family, Sherman, pictured winning the match for Seattle at the play off game on Sunday, getting to the Super Bowl is 'the icing on the cake'. His father said: 'Getting him to college was my first job' 'I was shot twice and had bullets lodged just above my heart. I was very lucky but it was a wake up call. It got my attention. 'I realised that I had to get my act together. I got married and my wife Beverly was instrumental in keeping me out of trouble. 'I knew I was meant to stay here to see my boys and I made sure that my life got better. I used to show them my bullet wounds to show them what happens when you get in with the wrong crowd and not doing what I was supposed to do.' He said that Richard was motivated from the very start and had a brilliant mind that meant he finished second in his class with a 4.2 grade point average. 'He did advance classes to get this higher percentage', he said. 'He chose Stanford over better football colleges because he wanted a great education. 'He got his degree and he is a couple of classes off his masters. When you look at the statistics and where he is from that is amazing. 'To me getting him to college was me doing my job. Getting to the Super Bowl is the icing on the cake. 'It . really doesn’t matter if he wins because he has achieved so much . already. Never in my wildest dreams would I think I would be sitting . here right now. 'It is . amazing what my boys have done. This is what you work your entire life . for. I am very, very proud of him. I am overwhelmed by his success.' Kevin, . who coached his sons every night after work, said there were setbacks – . not least the shooting to death of his best friend Marcus Peters, 19, . in 2007. But typically Richard used it to motivate himself. Pride: The Sherman family home, still in Compton, is a shrine to Richard's achievements in the last few years . Decent: Richard's brother told MailOnline that 'everybody who comes from Compton is not always a gangbanger. There is a lot of good in Compton. There is a lot of good in the inner city'. Pictured, family home . 'Marcus was not so lucky,' Kevin said. 'He and Richard were best friends. They ran together for many, many years. He was the nicest kid you would ever want to meet. 'Richard was very upset but he used what happened as motivation. He used it to make himself the best man that he could ever be.' Richard’s brother Branton, who was also a college footballer, said that he saved him from a life of crime. 'Richard is just the perfect little brother,' said Branton who is now the player's business manager and runs a sports marketing company. 'Richard was always on the straight . and narrow. He would always stay out of trouble. He followed what I did . but he learned from my mistakes. 'When . he was at Stanford I got into drug dealing and ended up in jail.  My . little brother came down and said: ""I don’t support the street stuff. Come up with me to Seattle and we are going to work hard and make things . happen"".' He agreed . that his brother had a 'chip on his shoulder' but said that was only . because people were prejudiced against his background. 'He . represents the American Dream,' he said. 'He is an awesome person. He . is a great guy who is just passionate about what he does. ' Not thugs: Branton, left, said: 'People have this image of where we are from, that we are all thugs, that we are all black people going off the Richter scale. But it is not true.' Richard, right, is pictured with his parents and sister Krystina . Richard himself reacted angrily to the racism he faced on Twitter in particular in the wake of his interview. He at first sent out a message that 'racism is alive and well in America'. Then in a CNN interview he said: 'It was really mind-boggling. And it was kind of - it was kind of sad that the way the world reacted - you know, I can't say the world. 'I don't want to generalize people like that, because there are a lot of great people who didn't react that way,' Sherman said. 'But for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there, it was really sad.' Branton added: 'People have this image of where we are from, that we are all thugs, that we are all black people going off the Richter scale. But it is not true. Richard is as far from that as you can get.' He said that he and his brother run a charity called Blanket Coverage to help children in the inner city and regularly visit schools and colleges in the area to help others become a success. Kevin and Richard's mother, Beverley, a senior clerk for California Children's Services, said they hoped his success would change the view of inner city children. Confused: Richard, in an interview with CNN, said he was saddened by the racial slurs he faced after the game . 'I would love for Richard to change the perceptions of kids from the inner city, kids that come from bad neighborhoods,' Kevin said. 'I want people to know that there are kids doing the right thing. Everybody who comes from Compton is not always a gangbanger. 'There is a lot of good in Compton. There is a lot of good in the inner city.'","Richard Sherman, 25, found notoriety and faced racial abuse over epic sideline rant after taking Seattle Seahawks to the Super Bowl .

"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today called on Scotland Yard to investigate ‘grotesque’ claims police helped to ‘cover up’ the death of an eight-year-old boy at the hands of a Westminster paedophile ring. Vishambar Mehrotra claims his son Vishal was murdered by a Westminster-based abusers after disappearing on the day of the Royal wedding in 1981. He said a male prostitute told him he was taken to the Elm Guest House where high-profile abusers attacked children. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Vishal Mehrotra's father Vishambar (right) claimed today that his son (left) was abducted, abused and murdered by the Westminster VIP paedophile ring after disappearing on the day of the Royal wedding in 1981 . Referring to claims on his weekly phone-in show on radio station LBC, Mr Clegg said: ‘You can’t think of a more serious and grotesque allegation than that, and it clearly needs to be looked into. ‘I think it is right for instance in other parts of the country that police officers have been, are now under scrutiny under the magnifying glass, for not having acted in Rotherham for instance.’ He added: ‘We are in the early stages of really a reckoning with our past, of things happening on a scale and of a gravity which just a few months ago would have seemed unimaginable and almost too horrific to contemplate.’ Mr Mehota recorded the conversation but when he presented police with the evidence, Scotland Yard ‘pooh poohed’ it and failed to investigate, he alleged. He claims that what happened to his son was part of a 'huge cover-up' while an MP has called for a full police inquiry. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‘I was contacted by a young man. He told me he believed Vishal may have been taken by paedophiles in the Elm Guest House. ‘He said there were very highly placed people there. He talked about judges and politicians who were abusing little boys. ‘I recorded the whole 15-minute conversation and took it to police. But instead of investigating it, they just pooh-poohed it and I never heard anything about the tape again. The whole thing went cold. ‘At that time I trusted the police. But when nothing happened, I became confused and concerned. Now it is clear to me that there has been a huge cover up. There is no doubt in my mind.’ Tip-off: Vishambar Mehrotra said soon after his son vanished a male prostitute told him he was taken to the Elm Guest House, pictured, where a VIP paedophile ring abused children . Vishal disappeared while walking back to his home in Putney after a family day trip to watch the celebrations for Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding on July 29, 1981. He had been walking a few hundred yards ahead of his family members and vanished less than a mile from his home. It was almost a year before his remains were found in isolated woodland in West Sussex in February 1982. He was missing his legs, pelvis and lower spine - and much of his clothing, including his Superman underpants were also gone. Four months after Vishal’s body was found, police raided Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London, and questioned dozens of men including a number of high profile individuals. Last week, another victim came forward alleging to have witnessed the murder of three boys including one who was strangled by a Conservative MP during a sex game. The Metropolitan Police announced last week that it is investigating the possibility of murders linked to the Elm Guest House. Mr Mehrotra, 69, said that now after all these years the truth about what happened to Vishal would finally be investigated properly. In May 1983, as police wound up the inquiry into Vishal Mehrotra’s death. West Sussex coroner Mark Calvert Lee recorded an open verdict at an inquest but said he believed ‘foul play’ was likely. It has been alleged several high-profile individuals abused also boys at the prestigious Dolphin Square (pictured) development in Pimlico . The owners of the Elm Guest House, Carole and Harry Kasir, were fined £1,000 each and given suspended nine-month sentences at the Old Bailey but were found not guilty of running a brothel. Mrs Kasir - who committed suicide in 1990 - later admitted to child protection officers that children from the council-run Grafton Close Children’s Home had been taken to the brothel and gave them names of people who had visited the guesthouse. The late Liberal MP Cyril Smith is one public figure widely alleged to have abused children from Grafton Close at the Elm Guest House. Last night Labour MP John Mann said: ‘It is another extraordinary development and it tallies with other allegations. ‘This young boy died in terrible circumstances and his family deserve a full police inquiry.’ AMetropolitan Police spokesman said the force was ‘not in a position to comment’ about Mr Mehota’s claims. Allegations of a VIP paedophile ring 30 years ago are being investigated by Scotland Yard through Operation Fairbank, launched two years. As well as Elm Guest House, some of the abuse allegedly took place at flats in Dolphin Square, Pimlico, where some politicians had London homes.

"Dimitar Berbatov has revealed how Monaco beat Arsenal with a simple plan to punish the spaces left by their predictable commitment to attacking flair and speed. ‘To be honest, we were not surprised,’ said Berbatov, scorer of Monaco’s second in a 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, which leaves Arsene Wenger’s team on the brink of a Champions League exit. The 34-year-old Bulgarian knew what to expect after seven-and-a-half years in the Barclays Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Fulham. Former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov compounded Arsenal's misery with Monaco's second . ‘Arsenal have very quick players and when they go forward they leave a lot of space at the back,’ said Berbatov. ‘We knew that and we had prepared well and took advantage of it. We knew their weaknesses and we exploited them and I think everyone can agree that we deserved our win. ‘Our team is very young but very talented. It is not only about age but about class. If you prepare well and do what your coach says, you can see the result. We believed we could do something. This is for everybody.’ Wenger bemoaned his team’s ‘suicidal’ defending, which leaves them with the task of scoring at least three times against Monaco in the second leg in the Stade Louis II, next month. Even so, Berbatov refused to accept the tie was won. ‘This is Arsenal, so it’s not over,’ he warned. ‘It is a long way away. We have other games to prepare for first.’ Arsenal players look stunned having put in a dismal performance against Monaco in the Champions League . Per Mertesacker looked despondent as the Gunners put in a shocking display to lose 3-1 to Monaco . They are at home to Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday in a crucial clash at the top of the French league. Even so, they savoured the victory few had predicted at Arsenal, as confirmation of their return to the top of European football. ‘It was an amazing result,’ said Monaco’s vice-president Vadim Vasilyev. ‘We just wanted to do our best, play our football, and didn’t have that much pressure. The pressure was with Arsenal. We had already achieved what we wanted to in the Champions League, which was to qualify for the knock-out stages. ‘So this victory is great and fantastic and it tells us that our project remains valid and ambitious and confirms that we are going the right way. We have a lot of respect for Arsenal and I’m sure the second match will be much more difficult.’ Geoffrey Kondogbia jumps into the air having fired Monaco into the lead at the Emirates on Wednesday .","Arsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates .

"Ambulance officers are kitting themselves out with 'homemade Ebola suits' as they and other health professionals say Australia is 'wide open' for an Ebola crisis and could not contain the virus from becoming an outbreak here. Paramedics say their gear is so inadequate if they treated a suspected Ebola case tomorrow, they wouldn't be able to go home for fear of infecting their families. A source at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs says medical authorities covered up Australia's first Ebola scare on August 10, when a man who had recently flown in from Nigeria was kept in the emergency ward car park for four hours while authorities argued over where he would be treated. Inadequate: Despite assurances by Australian health authorities that the regular protective gear worn by paramedics (pictured) is sufficient to prevent  'contact and droplet' contamination in Ebola cases, many health care workers are fearful and are making their own ""Ebola suits' to wear at work . Homemade: The white jumpsuit and face visor are not provided to ambulance officers and some other health care workers in Australia who are having to scrounge around for gear to keep them safe from Ebola infection. The real thing: A worker in a full Hazmat suit removes material while cleaning an apartment of a Texas health care worker. Australian health workers have warned that unless they get proper protection, they feel they won't be able to go home to their families after treating a suspected Ebola case . Flimsy: THis small face mask is all health workers like paramedics in NSW are supplied with and they say if someone is vomiting from the Ebola virus, they could be infected by splashes of the fluid from the Ebola victim . Making do: This breathing mask is one of the extra pieces of equipment some health care workers are gathering to make their own kit, should a case of Ebola come to Australia any time soon . An assurance by New South Wales Health's director of communicable diseases, Dr Vicky Sheppeard, last week that 'we're very well equipped and ready' for Ebola cases has angered frontline health workers who says that is 'nonsense' and fear for the safety of their families and friends. A hospital worker, who spoke to Daily Mail Australia on condition of anonymity, that the case of the Nigerian man - who eventually tested positive for malaria was handled so badly 'that ambulance officers were sent off with potentially Ebola infected gear, Prince of Wales and Royal North Shore hospitals argued over who would take him and there was no follow up about the Ebola issue with the people who handled him'. The Nigerian man ' ticked all the boxes' of the NSW Health Ebola virus disease patient risk assessment when he was taken to Prince of Wales. Ultra isolation: This is one of the two designated Ebola High Security Isolation Units at Westmead Hospital, the only hospital in NSW which can test for the deadly virus. Some health workers don't believe there are enough beds for potential Ebola outbreak, although health authorities insist any hospital can take a suspected victim . Well suited: The NSW Fire Brigade's station at Mascot Airport in Sydney (pictured) where paramedics say officers have Hazmat suits, the only gear adequate with which to handle suspected Ebola sufferers flying in from Africa . Completely covered: Health workers from Britain's North East Ambulance Service at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, UK, wear the right gear as they take part in an exercise to test Britain's readiness for an Ebola outbreak . Special training: Westmead Hospital staff including intensive care unit nursing manager Tracey-Lee Osling (pictured) have undergone training for how to deal with an Ebola pateint, but ambulance workers feel they have been left out and are at risk, while staff at an other major Sydney hospital also feel exposed to danger . 'As it turned out, he didn't have Ebola,' the source said, 'but if he had and he'd vomited or secreted some fluid the ambos would have done for. Ambulance staff are issued with a flimsy gown, goggles and a small mask for their ordinary day to day work. They say they have not been given extra Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) which would be adequate to cope with Ebola cases. They told Daily Mail Australia they are fearful of not being protected and are kitting themselves up by sourcing equipment from other professionals. 'Nothing has been communicated to us, so if a suspected Ebola case turned up tomorrow and I had to deal with it, I'm not going to go home. I couldn't take the risk of infecting my family.' One worker told Daily Mail Australia she had read in the media that the ambulance service had special vehicles to deal with an Ebola outbreak, but that 'we've been told nothing, we haven't been given any proper gear, it's scary'. Four hour agony: An ambulance in the Emergency car park at Prince of Wales hospital (pictured) in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where a Nigerian man waited for four hours in August, while doctors argued where the potential Ebola suspect should be treated . Border security: health care workers have suggested field hospitals be set up at all major airports such as Mascot in Sydney (pictured) to isolate planeloads should a passenger develop Ebola symptoms while en route to Australia from overseas . Daily Mail Australia obtained a set of the ordinary PPE gear worn by ambulance officers, and the special white suit and perspex face visor and breathing mask some officers are kitting themselves up with. One health professional said the only equipment suitable to deal with an Ebola outbreak belonged to the NSW Fire Service officers, who had 'hazmat' suits and were trained to deal with chemical leaks and similar crises. 'If a person flying to Australia developed symptoms on board tomorrow and a whole planeload of people had to be isolated where would they go?' the health professional said. No chance: Frontline health care workers in Sydney say they are in no way adequately kitted out to deal with Ebola victims like this Spanish worker (pictured) at Madrid's King Carols II Hospital . 'Westmead has two isolation beds and we have been told that is who will be taking Ebola cases. 'Surely the quarantine needs to be contained as swiftly as possible. So why isn't the Federal or State government setting up field hospitals or isolation wards at the major airports?' Professor Lyn Gilbert from Westmead Hospital, where two Ultra Isolation Rooms have been set up in the intensive care unit, said Westmead was the 'designated' hospital for Ebola cases in NSW. 'Unless there's a good reason why not, any patient with Ebola or who is highly likely to have Ebola will be transferred to Westmead,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'There is a level of anxiety because it is a disease with high mortality, but it can be treated. 'Staff have undergone training and we need to be super sure the staff know what's involved and what the risks are. 'If  a patient developed symptoms on a flight, unless that patient was copiously vomiting, the rest of the people on te plane would be absolutely minimal risk, although they would be anxious. 'The other passengers would be reassured and asked to report any illness developing. 'If there had been significant exposure they would be asked to place themselves in voluntary isolation, take their temperature twice a day and stay in very close contact.' Professor Gilbert said the Ebola training at Westmead had included a detailed protocol for removing protective gear after dealing with a suspected Ebola patient. 'Gowns, masks and face shields ... have to be taken off with great air in a very strict order and folded from the outside in. 'We have a buddy system, with someone watching and reminding them of the sequence if they forget.' Dr Vicky Sheppeard  told Daily Mail Australia the Nigerian man who was taken to Prince of Wales hospital in August 'did not require testing for Ebola as he did not meet the case definition'. How it's done: Aid workers and doctors transfer Spanish priest, Miguel Pajares, who was infected with Ebola while working in Liberia . Protective equipment: One of Westmead Hospital's two ultra isolation rooms (pictured) is stacked with equipment for nurses and doctors to treat Ebola patients, but some health workers say it is not enough if there is a severe outbreak . She said, 'all clinical staff assessing the patient, including paramedics, had the correct Personal Protective Equipment'. 'NSW Health has undertaken extensive preparations to ensure the health system is adequately prepared for the unlikely event of an Ebola case reaching NSW,' she said. Westmead is the only hospital equipped to test for the Ebola virus in NSW. Dr Sheppeard said all hospitals 'are equipped to isolate a suspected patient' and that NSW Health had 'held discussion-based exercises via teleconferences at state level ... to ensure staff awareness'. When told of health workers' fears, she said an Ebola protocol circulated in August had 'alleviated' fears about the levels of personal protection for health workers in NSW. She said the alleged case of the Nigerian man had never been regarded as a potential Ebola case, although paramedics told Daily Mail Australia the ambulance was roped off during the four hours it sat in the car parkwhile the hospitals argued over admission of the patient. Daily Mail Australia has asked the Federal Health Minister, Peter Dutton, about national strategies for an Ebola outbreak and the possibility of field hospitals at major airports, but had not received a response at the time of publication.","Paramedics are making 'Ebola suits' in fear of outbreak of disease in Australia .

"Man of the match Harry Kane hailed one of the 'greatest moments' in his fledgling Tottenham career after helping his side snatch a 2-1 comeback victory over 10-man Aston Villa with a late winner at Villa Park. Villa's five-game and 15-minute wait for a goal ended when Andreas Weimann opened the scoring following a spell of dominance from the hosts as he collected Charles N'Zogbia's cross to slot home from close range. Tempers flared for the second time in little over five minutes after the hour mark and Christian Benteke was shown a straight red card by referee Neil Swarbrick after a tussle with Erik Lamela in which the Belgium international raised his hand to his opponent's face. Harry Kane, on as a substitute, scored the winner before diving in front of the travelling Tottenham supporters . Kane's free-kick deflects off Nathan Baker's head and past Brad Guzan into the back of the Villa net . Things started to go downhill for the hosts after that and Spurs found their equaliser with five minutes left as an unmarked Nacer Chadli fired home Lamela's corner, before substitute Kane's deflected last-gasp free-kick claimed all three points for the away side. Kane told Sky Sports 1: 'Without a doubt it was one of the greatest moments for me in a Spurs shirt in my career so far. To be 1-0 down in an important game for us, we needed a win and to pull it back there at the end is a moment I won't forget.' The 21-year-old striker, who was sent on by Mauricio Pochettino with just over 30 minutes left, added: 'The manager said there's plenty of time left, to be getting on the ball, you'll get some chances so take one and obviously fortunately I was able to do that and it's all smiles in the dressing room now.' Kane is chased by his team-mates after scoring the winner in the last moments of the game at Villa Park . The travelling Spurs fans celebrate with the Spurs players in front of them at Villa Park on Sunday . As for taking the 89th-minute free-kick, Kane said: 'He (Lamela) wanted it and he'd taken the one before , but I said 'this one can be mine' and obviously it ended up in the back of the net and it was great - a great result.' Tottenham manager Pochettino believes Kane has certainly put his name forward to be included in the starting line-up for his side's next assignment away to Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League on Thursday. 'Yes it will be difficult because he score and gave us the victory and he gave a big impact for us. He deserves this reality,' said the Spurs boss. Andreas Weimann put Villa 1-0 in front after 16 minutes ending his side's goal drought . 'We select the team on analysis but since the beginning of the season he is getting better and improving and maybe he deserves to play in the next game, why not?' Pochettino was thrilled with his team's second-half efforts and insisted that his troops were full value for their 2-1 victory. 'The victory, I am happy for the players and the fans today. Today they were great and with the three points in a difficult stadium it is a good day,' he added. Nacer Chadli levelled matters in the 84th minute against 10-man Villa before Kane grabbed the winner late on . 'I think we started well. If you see the stats we have double chances and more. Aston Villa only shoot on target a few times but we shoot a lot. 'We need to be strong because always it is negative on the team but after the game against Newcastle I said we deserve more, our performance did not reflect in the table, but we will practise our philosophy. 'I don't see the action. Maybe now after we analyse maybe. But this is football. In football sometimes this happens throughout the season but I think in the end if we had 11 or 10 we were better than Aston Villa. 'This is football. Sometimes you are lucky. For us these three points are important.","Harry Kane's 89th-minute free kick ensured a 2-1 victory for Tottenham after the visitors were trailing 1-0 early in the second-half .

"Scientists have worked out how an octopus avoids tying itself in knots. As if having eight long and bendy arms to control isn’t tricky enough, the octopus’ brain doesn’t know exactly where they are at any one time. Yet, despite the potential confusion, the creature doesn’t get all tangled up. This, say Israeli scientists, is because its arms will stick to just about anything - other than themselves. An octopus' brain doesn't know exactly its arms are at any one time. Yet, despite the potential confusion, the creature doesn't get all tangled up. This, say Israeli scientists, is because its arms will stick to just about anything - other than themselves. Stock image pictured . Octopuses . are believed to be highly intelligent, more so than any other kind of . invertebrates; but their learning capability is still much debated among . biologists. The . creatures have been known to break out of aquariums and into others in . search of food, and they have even boarded fishing boats and opened . holds to eat crabs stored inside.

In . tests they can be readily trained to distinguish . between different shapes and patterns. It is thought the suckers that stud its arms temporarily shut down on sensing a chemical made by its skin. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem researchers said: ‘We were entirely surprised by the brilliant and simple solution of the octopus to this potentially very complicated problem.’ The team from the university’s Octopus Research Group began by capitalising on the ability of the octopus’s arm to stay alive long after amputation. Despite being able to move, grab and suck, amputated arms failed to attach to other arms – as long as they had skin on them. If they had been skinned, they happily grabbed hold of them. A close-up image of an octopus' suckers. They temporarily shut down if they sense a chemical on the octopus' skin. During tests the researchers said amputated arms still moved and grabbed after they'd been removed, but they failed to attach to other arms as long as they had skin on them . And when presented with skin in a plastic dish, they stuck to the dish but not to the skin. Further experiments pointed to a substance made by the skin stopping the suckers from sucking. Finally, the researchers showed that living octopuses can override the anti-knotting mechanism. The journal Current Biology reports that this could be useful if the cannibalistic creatures spy a piece of octopus flesh they’d like to eat .","An octopus’ brain doesn’t know where each of its arms are at any one time .

"Lucky escape: Victor Bywater was able to escape a fire at his Greater Manchester home when he was woken up by his pet cat . As fire began to engulf his house, businessman Victor Bywater slept soundly. He woke only when his cat Crystal leapt on his bed, bouncing and miaowing frantically. Alerted to the danger, Mr Bywater, 50, fled through the flames and smoke to safety. But tragically, the black and white moggy who saved his life perished in the blaze. His other cat, Fudge, escaped the inferno but has not been seen since. Last night Mr Bywater, who is said to be devastated by Crystal’s death, remained in hospital in a serious condition with burns to his head and damage to his lungs from smoke inhalation. The medical supplies company boss did not have a smoke alarm fitted inside his detached £250,000 house in Timperley, near Altrincham, Cheshire. Mr Bywater, who is divorced with three grown-up children, was asleep at 5.30am on Monday when Crystal entered the room and jumped on his bed. He fled the flames wearing only his dressing gown and woke neighbours to raise the alarm. A neighbour said: ‘He came banging on the door and I couldn’t believe the flames. ‘He said something about his cat waking him up when he was in bed and I’d say he got out in the nick of time. ‘The fire obviously started downstairs and made its way up. His Mercedes and Nissan cars were parked in his drive so I was terrified they’d explode and the fire would spread to our house. ‘Once we were out, he went banging on the other neighbour’s door to wake them. Vic doted on his cats and will be devastated at losing them.’ Fire crews praised the actions of Crystal for saving her master’s life. Altrincham station manager Kevin Brogden said Mr Bywater was ‘incredibly lucky to make it out’ alive. Investigators said the blaze is thought to have been caused by an electrical fault in the living room. The damage to the property is so extensive that it may have to be demolished. Station commander Peter Lamb said: 'Mr Bywater had been woken by his cat who was bouncing on his bed. 'He has come downstairs and has been confronted by a lot of smoke and heat. He managed to escape through the front door and call us out. 'He's fortunately been saved by his cat but his cat hasn't made it. He's got two, one found dead in the house and the other is unaccounted for at the moment.' The £250,000 property was badly damaged in the fire, which broke out at around 5.30am, and may now have to be demolished.

"Tragedy: Stephen Brookes, 29, who died after downing a pint of vodka after taking on a NekNominate challenge . A rugby fan died after downing almost a bottle of vodka during a NekNominate challenge, an inquest heard today. Stephen Brookes, 29, was six-times over the drink-drive limit when he collapsed after drinking more than a pint of the spirit 'in seconds' while being filmed by a friend. His distraught family said today he would still be alive today but for the NekNominate craze, which has claimed at least five lives in the past year. An inquest heard how Mr Brookes died after a night out with friends having watched Wales play Ireland in the Six Nations. Later he was dared to down vodka by friends as a crowd gathered to watch him. The inquest heard the labourer told them he would be 'OK' just before performing the stunt, but within minutes he had collapsed and could not be revived. Cousin Jodie Cummings told police: 'Stephen had been watching a rugby match with friends at a house. He had taken a 75cl bottle of vodka. 'A few weeks ago he had been NekNominated. This is something where somebody nominates a friend to down something like a bottle or a pint. 'After midnight when I was in the bathroom, Stephen down the bottle of vodka. 'It was filmed and I saw it on a friend's phone. I saw him neck back the bottle of vodka. He just held the bottle in the air. 'Afterwards he was in good spirits and said: ""You know me"". 'He was dancing around. But ten minutes later his balance has gone. He was slurring his words - it all happened so quickly.' Friends told police how people were encouraging Stephen to down the vodka at around 1am in February - the day after he had watched Wales play Ireland in the Six Nations rugby. Another friend Shaun Chivers said the vodka went 'within seconds' as he was filmed in the party near his home in Rumney, Cardiff. He said: 'I saw Stephen had three quarters of the bottle left and I knew he was going to neck it. 'I said: ""Stop effing around Brookes"" But the next thing he necked the bottle and it was gone in seconds. 'Soon after he was swaying all over the place.' Bereft: Mr Brookes collapsed after being filmed by a friend and his devastated family have said he would be alive if it wasn't for the craze . The Cardiff inquest heard how Stephen was taken home by friends and was put to bed. But he died within an hour of the NekNominate stunt after falling unconscious. His friends called an ambulance but he couldn't be revived. He was almost six times the legal drink-drive legal limit. He had 458 millilitres of alcohol in his blood - the drink-drive limit is 80. He also had a high level of cocaine in his blood and had taken between ten and twenty lines of cocaine. Pathologist Thomas Hockey said he was clearly 'well over' the fatal range for alcohol. He said: 'Most likely in this case is the alcohol causing the depression of his respiratory function and greatly slows down breathing.' Deputy coroner Christopher Woolley said: 'Stephen went to a party and had been drinking throughout the afternoon. 'He had drunk half a bottle of vodka and several cans of cider. 'At 1am it appears he drank a considerable quantity of alcohol - three quarters of a bottle of vodka in a NekNomination game. 'The idea is that the person is videoed and that is posted on Facebook. 'He very clearly deteriorated and was manhandled into a car. He was carried into his flat by friends. 'He was struggling to breathe and an ambulance was called.

"It is the unusual Catalan celebration that sees locals form precarious human pyramids. And this year's La Mercè 2014 festival, in Barcelona, Spain, was no different, with 36 people clamering on top of each other to form the amazing tower. The group of acrobats performed the stunt which is known locally as 4 de 9 amb folre (9 levels of 4 people) in the Sant Jaume Square area of Barcelona. All of the acrobats wear matching outfits and they show composure and discipline to complete the challenging routine. The performers all take up individual responsibilities with a multitude of the acrobats supporting their colleagues on the bottom while others climb up to the top of the group. It takes the dozens of acrobats one minute and 40 seconds to assemble the impressive human pyramid and there is a rapturous round of applause from the audience when they complete the task. It takes the group one minute and eight seconds to dismount the human pyramid and as they do the participants cheer and congratulate each other on a successful performance.

"A barrister yesterday defended the right of journalists to pay whistleblowers for stories in the public interest. Representing a reporter who faces jail for making the child-killer Jon Venables feel ‘down in the dumps’, John Butterfield QC said: ‘They call it crime – we call it democracy.’ He went on to say: ‘It is necessary and appropriate to reimburse whistleblowers against the risk they are going to get the sack. The issues that this prosecution would seek to trample over are as serious as it gets in a democratic country.’ John Butterfield QC defended the right of journalists to pay whistleblowers for stories at the Old Bailey . Speaking of journalists’ role in society, he said: ‘We need them – we need them to be brave. We need them to be pushing at the edges. ‘You don’t have to take it from me. Take it from the children of Rotherham. Utterly, utterly ignored by the authorities, but a campaigning journalist brought it to light.’ He accused the state of trying to ‘clip the wings’ of reporters, telling the Old Bailey that MPs would still ‘have their noses in the trough’ but for the journalists who uncovered the expenses scandal. He attacked the Crown’s ‘tabloid-bashing’ prosecution of journalists, which he said was driven by ‘rampant snobbery’. He spoke in the trial of a News of the World reporter, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, and Thomas Savage, 37, deputy news editor of the Daily Star Sunday. They are accused of paying prison officer Scott Chapman, 42, thousands for information on Venables, the infamous killer of James Bulger, while he was in jail for child porn offences in 2010. Chapman funnelled the money through his ex Lynn Gaffney, 40, the court heard. Describing the articles published about Venables, Mr Butterfield said: ‘Evil – monster – fiend. Yes, it is tabloid-speak. You tell me which of those words can’t be justified. ‘[The prosecution] have described the articles as drivel. It is drivel, is it, that he enjoys conditions which would make other prisoners green with envy?’ John Ryder QC, for Savage, said the stories about Venables were ‘entirely legitimate’. Journalists are accused of paying a prison officer thousands of pounds for information on Jon Venables (pictured), the infamous killer of James Bulger, while he was in jail for child porn offences in 2010 . The News of the World reporter had previously told the court that exposing the killer’s ‘comfortable’ prison lifestyle was more important than sparing the feelings of a man who had done ‘despicable things’. He said the state was ‘protecting the child murderer and confirmed paedophile Jon Venables from feeling a bit down in the dumps’. Mr Butterfield said that the articles written about Venables had been ‘handsomely justified in the public interest’. But he added: ‘There is a massive contrast in public interest, between the prosecution and the defence. ‘They call it crime. We call it democracy. Democracy in action.’ He said payment for stories was ‘a necessary article for the press to have in their armoury’. The News of the World reporter denies knowing Chapman was a prison officer. Both journalists deny conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. Chapman and Gaffney, both of Corby, Northamptonshire, deny misconduct in a public office. Chapman is said to have more than doubled his £29,000 salary selling stories to the News of the World, The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, The People, the Daily Star and the Daily Star Sunday between March 2010 and June 2011. The trial continues. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Barrister John Butterfield QC defended journalists' right to pay for stories .

"The Florida mother of a woman who went missing after appearing on the show The People's Court in 2011 has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her daughter's former fiance. Michelle Parker, 33, of Orlando, vanished on November 17, 2011, the same day the episode of The People's Court featuring her case aired on television. Parker and her ex-fiance, Dale Smith, who is the father of her twins, came on the show to resolve a dispute over a lost $5,000 engagement ring. New evidence: Michelle Parker disappeared two years ago after appearing on The People's Court with her ex-finance Dale Smith, new police have revealed they have new video evidence . Crusading mother: Michelle Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, filed a wrongful death lawsuit claiming that Smith is to blame for the disappearance of the woman, who is now presumed dead . The mother of three was last seen dropping off her three-year-old twins at Smith's home. Police named Smith as the prime suspect in her disappearance, but he has never been arrested or charged in the case. The lawsuit filed by Parker's mother, . Yvonne Stewart,  seeks damages totaling over $15,000, alleging that . Smith was 'negligent or otherwise committed a wrongful act and caused . the death' of the woman. Her body has never been found, but . the lawsuit claims that the 33-year-old 'died on or about November 17, . 2011 as a direct and proximate result of the negligence of the . defendant.' '[Yvonne Stewart] doesn't want to . believe it happened, but everyone knows what happened and when it . happened,' Parker estate attorney John Morgan said to ABCNews.com. 'We . think she was killed.' The lawyer claims he is in poseesion . of text messages between Parker and Smith, as well as other evidence . that he would no further elaborate on, saying that he does not want . Smith to be 'ready for that.' 'We'll be most interested when we get a chance to depose him,' Morgan said. 'Will he take the fifth or tell the truth?' Smith's attorney, Mark Nejame, . insists that Morgan and Parker's family have nothing to connect his . client to the woman's disappearance. Dispute: Michelle Parker appeared on The People's Court to dispute an engagement ring with ex-fiance Dale Smith. The program aired two years ago and on the same day Parker disappeared . 'They're barking up the wrong tree,' Nejame said. 'They've been frustrated for a long time because law . enforcement hasn't found a scintilla of evidence that ties him to her . disappearance or murder...Just because everyone thinks he did it doesn't . mean he did it.' The lawyer said that Smith . voluntarily spoke to police on four separate occasions and submitted to a . full home insepction just hours after his ex-fiancee was reported . missing. 'Our hearts go out to Michelle . Parker's family, truly, but sadly a lawsuit against Dale Smith is not . going to bring them any closer to finding out what happened to Michelle . Parker,' he said. The attorney described his client as a . good father to his four-year-old wins. Parker's 10-year-old son lives . with his father in Pennsylvania. The grandparents have a written . agreement with Smith for the custofy of the children, but Stewart has . been pushing for clearer rights established and legal right to poetition . the court for visitation. Stewart launched a campaign and . petition that grants visitation rights to grandparents when a child's . parent goes missing or is murdered. The bill is backed by Florida House . Representative Darryl Rouson and it is expected to come into legislature . this session, Morgan said. 'Rocky': The couple's relationship was described as 'tense' by friends . Stewart's missing daughter had a very stormy relationship with Smith. She was last seen dropping off the twins at Smith's house. Police conducted an night-time raid on Smith's father's home during investigations but would not comment on the findings of the search or and what sparked the raid. Miss Parker's friend Angela Launer told ABCNews.com: . 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself.' Miss Launer, 34, said the relationship was 'rocky' and 'tense.' Dale Smith (left) remains the prime suspect in the unsolved disappearance of Michelle Parker (right) She said: 'He hurt my best friend. I didn't like him because he made her cry. No one should ever be treated that way.' Miss Parker applied for a restraining order from Smith in 2009, but was denied one for lack of evidence. It has also been revealed that Smith was dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 after several court martials, including military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery. On the TV show Miss Parker and Smith argued over whether Parker had to pay for a $5,000 engagement ring she tossed away during one of their arguments. The judge ruled the two should split the cost. Miss Parker's family began to realize something was wrong when her 11-year-old son let the family know that he was home from school and his mother was not there. Miss Launer said: 'She would never have taken off, done that to her brother, sister or mother ... that's why we're crying every day.'","Michelle Parker, 33-year-old mother of 3, argued with ex-fiance Dale Smith, 40, on The People's Court then vanished same day show was aired .

The elephant had invaded the hippopotamus's territory on the Chobe River, in Botswana, and the angry hippo seemed keen to make its feelings clear.

Standoff: A brave hippo squared up to an enormous African elephant when it approached its territory for a drink . Her pictures show the elephant proudly standing on an island in the river, while the submerged hippo approaches through the water. When the hippo gets onto the island it does its best to intimidate the unwelcome guest by widening its jaws and bearing teeth. The elephant lowers its head but the battle is over before it has begun as more elephants arrive and the hippo backs off. The enormous elephant had been watched by the hippopotamus as it approached the water . Undeterred by the elephant's size it came out from the water to try its chances at scaring the giant animal away . Ms Cambre said: 'There is an island on the middle of the Chobe River to which this elephant had crossed. The hippo was not happy about it and was apparently defending its territory. When more elephants crossed the river to the island the hippo backed off and went back into the river.'

"The Archbishop of Canterbury today warned politicians against inflammatory language presenting immigration as a 'deep menace' to Britain. The Most Rev Justin Welby said he was worried about the use of language in the debate amid an upsurge of abuse and urged people not to suggest new arrivals could 'overwhelm' Britain. His remarks came after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon sparked controversy after saying some parts of the country felt 'swamped' by immigrants. Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Reverend Justin Welby today warned against using inflammatory language around immigration . Michael Fallon said he was 'careless' to claim some towns were being 'swamped' by immigrants . Mr Fallon today admitted he was 'a bit careless' with his words but maintained that the 'large number' of immigrants coming from the continent was putting pressure on housing and essential services in the UK. But the Archbishop of Canterbury, speaking at a Westminster lunch today, said: 'Do I worry about the language? Yes I do, I really do.' 'We can't overburden communities, we have to be realistic about that. But at the heart of Christian teaching about the human being is that all human beings are of absolutely equal and infinite value and the language we use must reflect the value of the human being and not treat immigration as a deep menace that is somehow going to overwhelm a country that has coped with many waves of immigration and has usually done so with enormous success. 'It is part of the strength and brilliance of this country that we are so good at this, and I would hate to see us lose that.' Under pressure from Ukip and with a crunch by-election looming in the Rochester and Strood constituency, Mr Fallon had significantly ramped up Tory rhetoric on the sensitive issue. He warned that some areas felt 'under siege' and action was needed 'to prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers'. A Government source said the Defence Secretary should have 'chosen his words better' as Downing Street sought to calm the situation following Mr Fallon's comments. But the minister stood by the substance of his remarks as he acknowledged he had been careless in his choice of language. Former Tory MP Mark Reckless is favourite to win the Rochester and Strood by-election on November 20 . Mr Fallon told Sky News: 'I was a bit careless with my words, I accept that. But, yes, there is pressure now, there are a large number of people coming here from the rest of Europe - this is one of the more successful economies in Europe and there is pressure as a result of that migration on social services, on housing, on school places for example. 'That's what the Prime Minister will be addressing when he puts forward his proposals for some kind of control.' Labour's Keith Vaz, chairman of the influential Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Fallon's original comments had been 'nasty, inappropriate and wrong'. Labour leader Ed Miliband, campaigning with Yvette Cooper (left) and the party's candidate Naushabah Khan (centre) last week . Politicians have faced criticism before for the use of the word 'swamped' when talking about immigration. In 2002, David Blunkett refused to apologise for saying asylum seekers were 'swamping' some British schools. The then Labour Home Secretary made his remarks while defending the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. The Campaign for Racial Equality said they were 'hugely emotive'. In 1978, Margaret Thatcher said people feared being 'swamped' by immigration from the new Commonwealth and Pakistan. On the prospect of four million immigrants, she said: 'Now, that is an awful lot and I think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.' David Cameron will face questions from MPs later about his Government's increasingly fraught relationship with Europe following Brussels' shock demand for an extra £1.7 billion from the British taxpayer. The Prime Minister is also likely to be asked about his approach to tackling immigration within the EU after Mr Fallon was effectively slapped down by Number 10 yesterday. Mr Cameron's plan to put controlling EU immigration at the heart of his renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels before an in/out referendum has been met with staunch opposition from Germany. Finance minister Wolfgang Schauble stated that 'the basic rules of the EU are not up for negotiation' following Chancellor Angela Merkel's insistence that she would not allow 'tampering' with the principle of free movement. Mr Schauble told the Times: 'The principle of the freedom of movement is one of the basic principles of European integration and it cannot be restricted. That would be incompatible with the European treaties.' He added: 'There is not much room to manoeuvre . The basic rules of the EU are not up for negotiation.' It would be 'unthinkable' to re-impose border controls within the EU, he said. Ukip's tough line on immigration and the EU is seen as a major factor behind its surging popularity. The party came top in European elections earlier this year, and a poll has suggested it is on track to secure its second MP in the Rochester and Strood by-election on November 20 - triggered by the defection of Mark Reckless from the Tories. After being presented with the demand for a £1.7 billion surcharge to UK budget contributions in Brussels last week, an exasperated Mr Cameron is said to have pleaded with European counterparts to cut him some slack or they could end up with Nigel Farage in his chair. The premier has insisted the bill will not be paid by the deadline of December 1 and referred the matter to finance ministers for closer examination. For its part, the European Commission has argued that the contribution revisions were calculated by independent statisticians using a standard formula agreed by all member states. There are questions over why the Government did not see the problem coming months ago and Chancellor George Osborne is also under scrutiny after it emerged that he knew days before the summit but failed to tell the PM. Ukip will try to win 100 seats at the general election as it seeks to build on a surge in support, the party's biggest donor has revealed. Businessman Paul Sykes said the anti-EU party would widen its ambitions and invest in an ad campaign that would be 'seen from the Moon'. Mr Sykes, who will give another £1.5 million to help step up the drive, said Ukip will be raising 'significant further funds' as it targets many more marginal seats than the few dozen it had originally identified. The Ukip leader hopes Mr Reckless - candidate in Rochester and Strood - will become the party's second MP . He told the Sunday Times: 'Ukip is not going to lose the campaign because we don't have enough adverts.' Research by Opinium for the Observer yesterday found that nearly a third of the public would vote Ukip if they thought it could win in their area. Former Home Office minister Damian Green warned that it would be a 'complete disaster' if the Tories became 'Ukip-lite', urging the Conservatives to 'calm down'.","Justin Welby warned politicians against using inflammatory language .

"No matter whether you are a true believer in ‘climate change’ or an ardent sceptic, you’ll surely appreciate the delicious irony of the story which has been playing out in Antarctica. A scientific research team who headed south to prove the threat to mankind from global warming by establishing that the region is melting have found themselves trapped on their ship in the unexpectedly thick pack ice. The £900,000 expedition began full of high hopes early last month. Scroll down for video . MV Akademik Shokalskiy trapped in the ice at sea off Antarctica. A scientific research team who headed south to prove the threat to mankind from global warming by establishing that the region is melting have found themselves trapped on their ship . A team of Australian climate scientists set out on a Russian research ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy on a mission to raise awareness of global warming. ‘The research stakes are high,’ claimed a sympathetic report on Australia’s ABC TV station. ‘Antarctica is one of the great engines driving the world’s oceans, winds and weather. But there are ominous signs of climate change . . .’ Up until Christmas, all seemed to be going well. Besides the Russian crew and the Australian climate scientists, the ship’s 85-strong company included an Australian Green MP, two environment journalists from the Guardian newspaper and a BBC science journalist eager to relay details of the expedition’s vital findings which support their gospel of man-made global warming. Each day, Guardian readers were entertained by bulletins of the expedition’s latest adventures: the seasickness; the icy cold; the penguins; ‘the mysterious song of the leopard seal’. But then on Day 16, disaster struck. ‘Stuck in Antarctica’s icy grasp’ noted the report, describing how the ship had been hit on Christmas Eve by a 50-knot blizzard and then become stuck in pack ice. At first, the intrepid explorers put a brave face on the irony of their predicament. The ice would soon blow away and besides, here was some unexpected free time to extend their researches. As the days went by, though, it slowly became clear that this wasn’t going to be a temporary problem. The ship was stuck fast — at the height of what is supposed to be the Antarctic summer and when the ice normally melts rather than thickens — and was in urgent need of rescue. The Russian-registered MV Akademik Shokalskiy became stuck in ice on 24 December with 48 passengers, mostly Australians, and around 20 crew on board . Perhaps, with hindsight, it was a mistake to christen the expedition the Spirit of Mawson in memory of Sir Douglas Mawson, the great Edwardian-age Australian explorer in whose icy footsteps the mission hoped to follow. But though Mawson did much fine work mapping the then-unknown region, his 1911-1913 expedition came badly unstuck. On a trek into the interior, Mawson and his crew lost most of their food supplies when their sledge disappeared into a crevasse. Stuck 350 miles from the coast with only one and a half weeks’ worth of food, Mawson nearly came to an end as sticky as Captain Scott’s earlier that same year. Mawson and his sole surviving companion, Mertz, were driven to eating their dogs, unaware that the livers were poisonous. Their hair fell out; the soles of Mawson’s feet fell off; Mertz ultimately went mad, bit off the top of his finger and died. By the time Mawson staggered back to base in February 1913, he was so hideously ravaged that no one recognised him. Still, in at least one respect, Mawson had an advantage over his 21st century followers. As we can see from period photographs, this part of the Antarctic was noticeably less frozen in the early 20th century than it is today. There was no visible sea ice in Commonwealth Bay where the MV Akademik Shokalskiy and its crew first got stuck. And where, unfortunately, it remains stuck — despite the best efforts of three icebreakers. One made it to within ten nautical miles of the stranded vessel only to be driven back by bad weather; so too did the other two ships when it became clear that the ice was so thick they were in danger of being trapped themselves. The team have found themselves trapped on their ship in the unexpectedly thick pack ice . Ziggy Marzinellia and Graeme Clark, preparing a suitable surface for a helicopter landing next to the MV Akademik Shokalskiy (background), stuck in the ice off East Antarctica . This was probably not the kind of publicity the expedition was hoping for when it set out to alert the world to the growing perils of global warming. But you wouldn’t necessarily guess this from the defiant tone of the statement it released two days ago. It read: ‘We’re stuck in our own experiment. We came to Antarctica to study how one of the biggest icebergs in the world has altered the system by trapping ice.‘We followed Sir Douglas Mawson’s footsteps into Commonwealth Bay, and are now ourselves trapped by ice surrounding our ship. ‘Sea ice is disappearing due to climate change, but here ice is building up. We have found this has changed the system on many levels. ‘The increase in sea ice has freshened the seawater below, so much so that you can almost drink it. This change will have impacts on the deep ocean circulation.’ This attempt to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat may display an admirable unflappability worthy of the great Mawson himself. But it does also show a certain disregard for real world scientific data — most of which roundly contradicts the statement that ‘sea ice is disappearing due to climate change.’ In fact, current evidence suggests that the opposite is true. This is certainly the case in Antarctica — where sea ice coverage, which has been increasing for several years, is now approximately two million square kilometres greater than the 1981 to 2010 average. But also, perhaps more surprisingly, in the Arctic — the place which according to some scaremongering reports was going to be ice-free in summer by 2020. This year, much to the consternation of climate alarmists, it emerged that Arctic summer ice coverage had increased by 29 per cent over the same period last year. Why then, did the scientists on the Spirit of Mawson expedition, feel compelled to tell a different story? One answer may lie in the identity of the expedition leader, Professor Chris Turney, of the University of New South Wales. The ship was stuck fast -  at the height of what is supposed to be the Antarctic summer and when the ice normally melts rather than thickens . He is a geographer who believes that global carbon dioxide emissions targets need to be drastically reduced if the Earth is to avoid catastrophic warming. For scientists who have built their reputation on (and whose research funding depends upon) research into man-made global warming, it clearly matters greatly that they should find more and more compelling evidence of the problem’s existence. Otherwise their work might dry up. Like many scientists, politicians and businessmen on the so-called ‘warmist’ side of the argument, Professor Turney also has green business interests which may partly depend for their success on the degree of public concern about the global warming issue. Also, like Australia’s former climate commissioner and environmental activist Tim Flannery, he is a major shareholder in Carbonscape Holdings Ltd, which aims to reduce carbon emissions. Unfortunately for those scientists and activists who have gained so much attention from pushing the global warming agenda — while they ultimately may be proved right — the real world evidence does not currently appear to be on their side. As the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report admitted for the first time, there has been no significant rise in global temperature since 1997. This 16-year ‘pause’ was not predicted by any of the computer models on which the IPCC has long based its warnings of extreme global warming. But will any of these inconvenient truths get a mention in the breathless accounts describing the Spirit of Mawson expedition’s last moments as the 85-strong company are finally rescued by helicopter? That’s about as likely as a snowball’s chance in hell.","Australian scientists set out on Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy .

Give-away: Presenter Aamir Liaquat Hussain has given two babies to childless couples so far during Islam's holy month . A head of a charity which rescues abandoned babies then handed the baby over to a childless couple, reported The Telegraph. The baby was handed over to Riaz-ud-din and his wife. 'These 14 years were full of hardships, people asked to go for second marriage but I remained patient and also asked my wife to be patient,' he said. Controversial: In last week's episode Mr Hussain told the studio audience: 'This is the beautiful girl who was thrown on pile of garbage by somebody. See how beautiful and innocent she is' The new parents named the baby Fatima, according to The News. The babies were presented by Muhammad Ramzan Chhipa, who runs the Chhipa Welfare Association. 'We have lots of babies that are just abandoned, left in the garbage or other dirty places,' he said. 'Often we just find the bodies so our message that we make is to tell people to bring their babies to us, don’t just leave them.' He said the couples had previously approached his organisation to adopt children, although he did not discuss the vetting process.

The show is this year's offering from TV channel Geo News and boasts of 'soul-stirring experiences' to 'rub balm on the wounds' of the downtrodden. Other giveaways include ten motorcycles, home-theatre systems, laptops and washing machines. In the conservative Muslim nation, where the birth of children outside of marriage is condemned and adultery is a crime punishable by death under strict interpretations of Islamic law, hundreds of babies are abandoned every month. Girl babies are more likely to be abandoned - they are seen by many Pakistanis as a greater economic burden as most women are not permitted to work and are considered to be the financial responsibility of their fathers, and later their husbands. A Pakistani family can be forced to raise more than one million rupees (£6,450) to marry their daughter off. According to Pakistani law, anyone found to have abandoned an infant can be jailed for seven years, .","Presenter Aamir Liaquat Hussain gave two babies to childless couples .

Mr Han can be seen trying to clamber back onto the platform as the train approaches but he was no one on the platform tried to assist him.

The previous day, Mr Han's family spoke of their 'disbelief' over his death. At an emotional press conference his . daughter Ashley and widow Serim battled through tears describing how . they are haunted that no one tried to save their loved one.

Seconds later the train struck and killed Mr Han. 'My condolences to the family, and if I could have, I would have pulled Mr. Han out,' Abbasi said on NBC's Today show. Controversial: The New York Post put photo of Mr Han on their cover . The newspaper featured one of Mr Abbasi's photographs on its front page under the headline 'Doomed'.

"Nacer Chadli has backed Harry Kane for a senior England call-up despite admitting he had never heard of the young striker before joining Tottenham. Kane's free-kick winner at Aston Villa on Sunday was his seventh goal in his last seven games and eighth of the season. He has nine England Under-21 caps and six goals after helping Gareth Southgate's side to Euro 2015 qualification last month. Harry Kane's deflected free-kick gave Tottenham a last-gasp victory at Aston Villa on Sunday . Kane is chased by his team-mates after scoring the winner in the last moments of the game at Villa Park . Roy Hodgson's senior side host Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier before a friendly in Scotland in two weeks and Chadli believes his team-mate deserves a call-up. He said: 'Why not? It is up to him and the manager of the national team. He has a lot of quality and he can have some impact in the game. 'He practises a lot of free kicks like that in training. He has a great shot and he still practises it. That is good, he is a young talented player. I am very happy for him and pleased for him that he made an impact.' But the Belgium international, who scored Tottenham's first at Villa Park, admitted he did not know who the Spurs academy graduate was when he arrived from Twente last year. 'When I came to Tottenham I had not heard of him. But I am used to training with him and I can see that he is a very talented man and I can see that he has a great future,' he told reporters. Nacer Chadli looks to advance beyond Matthew Lowton in the game at Villa Park on Sunday . Chadli scored with six minutes remaining to make it 1-1 against Aston Villa . Chadli and Kane netted in the final six minutes in the 2-1 win on Sunday as boss Mauricio Pochettino resisted calls to start the latter. He has been the key man for Spurs in cup competitions, scoring a hat-trick against Asteras last month, but is yet to start in the Barclays Premier League this season. And Chadli admitted Pochettino will find it hard to leave the 21-year-old out for the Europa League trip to Asteras on Thursday and Saturday's league visit of Stoke. He said: 'Everybody gets time to play as we play in the Europa League, in the Capital One Cup, the FA Cup soon and the Premier League, so there are a lot of competitions. Everybody gets to play minutes. So the manager has choices.'","Tottenham left it late to grab a dramatic 2-1 win at Aston Villa .

"Roberto Soldado scored his first Premier League goal since March and Harry Kane was again excellent for Tottenham as they beat Everton 2-1 at White Hart Lane. Kevin Mirallas scored the game's best goal while Kane was the man of the match. Find out how the other players got on with Sportsmail's player ratings. TOTTENHAM . Hugo Lloris - 6.5 . Helpless for the opening goal but made a good save from Romelu Lukaku early in the first half and was quick off his line to deny the Belgian after a weak Vlad Chiriches back pass. Hugo Lloris was helpless to prevent a magnificent effort from Kevin Mirallas in the first half at White Hart Lane . Vlad Chiriches ( 70' Dier) - 4.5 . Gave away the free-kick that led to the opening goal and looked unsure when Leighton Baines attacked, even more so when he was joined by Kevin Mirallas. His weak pass-back almost led to a one-on-one for Lukaku in the first half. Federico Fazio - 6 . Looked more assured after some nervy performances in recent weeks. He's still not the finished article but supporters should be encouraged. Jan Vertonghen - 6.5 . If Mauricio Pochettino was hoping the defender's time out of the side would make him hungrier, it seems to have worked. Snapped into tackles and organised the defence well when they came under late pressure. Tottenham defender Federico Fazio tracks back to challenge Everton's Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku . Ben Davies - 6.5 . Appeared to have a quiet game but the lack of chances created by Everton down his flank was evidence of a decent showing. Ryan Mason - 7 . Excellent performance - tenacious in the centre of the park and provided the basis for his side's attacking moves. His partnership with Bentaleb looks really promising. Nabil Bentaleb - 6.5 . Strong and assured in central midfield again. Combined well with Mason to consistently force Everton out to the wings. Christian Eriksen - 7.5 . Another excellent performance from the Dane. Scored the equaliser and combined brilliantly with Tottenham's forwards throughout. Christian Eriksen smiles as he watches his shot find the back of the net in the first half . Aaron Lennon ( 61' Lamela) - 6.5 . Worked really hard defensively against the double threat of Baines and Mirallas, never really got a chance to use his pace going forward but provided the assist for Soldado's goal. Harry Kane - 8.5 . Once again proved himself to be Tottenham's most effective forward. Decent run and shot led to Eriksen's goal and dispossessed a ponderous Barry in the build up to the second. Roberto Soldado ( 81' Paulinho) - 7 . Pochettino recently revealed he had designed special training exercises for Soldado to help boost the Spaniard's confidence, they seem to have worked. Could have done more to prevent Mirallas' shot for the first goal but more than made up for it with a brilliantly taken chance just before half time. Manager: . Mauricio Pochettino - 7.5 . The Argentine manager will be delighted with the way his side played but he has to take considerable credit himself. Tottenham's midfield dominated the game throughout and his training methods appears to have finally got through to Soldado. Roberto Soldado scored his first league goal since March after good work from the excellent Harry Kane . EVERTON . Tim Howard - 5 . Should have done better for Spurs' opening goal - his weak save from Kane's equally weak shot proved costly as the ball fell into Eriksen's path. Seamus Coleman - 6.5 . Decent going forward and his pace saved Everton shortly after the break when Jagielka misjudged the flight of long pass. Everton's best defender on the night. Sylvin Distin was dragged out of position for Tottenham's opening goal and looked exposed in the first half . Phil Jagielka - 5.5 . Had his hands full with Kane and Soldado and didn't always impress, the poor performances of those in front of him left him exposed but some of his decision making was also questionable. Sylvin Distin - 5 . Dragged out of position for Spurs' opening goal and looked as though he needed more support from Everton's midfielders. Leighton Baines - 6 . Solid at the back and got forward well in the first half but as the game wore on he found his chances limited. Muhamed Besic struggled to get to grips with Tottenham's midfield and almost gave away a late penalty . Muhamed Besic - 4 . Second best against Tottenham's central midfielders for much of the game, struggled to deal with Kane and Eriksen. Only settled into the game when the hosts sat back in the second half and could have given way a late penalty. Gareth Barry - 5 . Like Besic, struggled against Tottenham's midfield. Partially at fault for Spurs' second goal after he was dispossessed by Kane in the build up. This performance demonstrated how important James McCarthy is for Barry. Ross Barkley - 6.5 . Promising performance for Everton fans, some of his first half play was reminiscent of his form last season. His influenced waned sightly in the second half but he still looked the most likely source for an Everton equaliser. Ross Barkley was Everton's best midfielder on the night but couldn't help force an equaliser . Kevin Mirallas ( 61' McGeady) - 6.5 . Showed great endeavour to win the free kick that he eventually scored from. What a goal it was, too. Samuel Eto'o (61' Osman) - 5 . Didn't seem quite sure of his role and failed to influence the game in any meaningful way. Everton fans may wonder why he started ahead of Leon Osman against a strong Spurs midfield. Romelu Lukaku - 5.5 . Missed a good chance early in the first half struggled to have any real impact on the match. To be fair to the former Chelsea man he was completely isolated for much of the game. Manager: . Roberto Martinez - 6 . Not an embarrassing performance by any stretch of the imagination but there was far too much sideways passing from the visitors and a number of Everton's forwards looked unsure of their roles in the first half. Referee: . Michael Oliver - 7 . Both sides had penalty claims turned down, stayed out of the limelight and allowed the game to flow whenever possible. Mirallas is congratulated by Romelu Lukaku and Barkley after scoring Everton's spectacular opener .","Kevin Mirallas opened the scoring for Everton with a brilliant effort .

"At the top of a winding North Carolina mountain road is the entrance to Oz, a 1970s theme park abandoned less than 10 years after it opened. In its heyday the Land of Oz could attract 20,000 visitors a day, but now the neglected Yellow Brick Road is missing some bricks, the Wicked Witch of the West's castle is empty and the Emerald City has disappeared.

In its first summer 400,000 visitors came to the Land of Oz . The park was designed originally to walk tourists through the story, starting with the farmhouse, where Aunt Em could be found in the kitchen . Using local craftsmen and entertainers, Robbins and designer Jack Pentes built their grand interpretation of the popular 1939 film over 450 acres. The Yellow Brick Road wound its way through the park, leading tourists to a replica Emerald City. Dorothy's house, the castle of the Wicked Witch of the West and the Munchkin village were all faithfully recreated. The men behind the project even set up a . balloon ride made out of a ski lift, so that visitors would get a . winged-monkey's eye view of the park nestled in the mountains before . they were whisked back to the real world.

Theatrical: Local entertainers would play the parts of characters in the beloved film, greeting families as they explored the mountain resort theme park . Abandoned . and forgotten, the park became a target for vandals and thieves, who . destroyed or stole props in the park, including entire houses. The park was designed originally to walk . tourists through the story, starting with the farmhouse, where Aunt Em . could be found in the kitchen.

However, characters carved into the trees lining the now uneven Yellow Brick Road and stone characters scattered throughout the Munchkin village appear ghoulish in the abandoned park, and the witch's castle looms eerily in the mountain mist. All hope is not lost for the Land of Oz . though. In the 1990s project Emerald Mountain was started by a group of . kind-hearted volunteers who, with a little bit of the Cowardly Lion's . courage and the Scarecrow's brains, have slowly restored the park. Popular: Judy Garland as Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, released in 1939. One of her dresses and props from the film were in a museum at the park . Lost in time: The Land of Oz was once filled with families exploring the mountain park, but its exhibits, like the Munchkin village, right, are now eerily deserted . Weeds have been cleared from the Yellow Brick Road, the fountain and waterfall have been repaired and, proving that there really is no place like home, Dorothy's house has been converted into a cosy cottage, which can be rented to holiday-makers. 'Each summer we add something back to OZ. Sometimes it is original items returned to us from caring friends. One of my proudest moments was hauling back to OZ what I believe to be the very last balloon in existence,' Cynthia Keller, who helps look after the park, said. Tourists are still welcome at the Land of Oz where they have the option of hiring a costume and going in search of the Emerald City. The park also holds a two-day festival each year, with a guided tour through the park, a picnic at the Kansas farmhouse and, for an additional $100, a whirlwind visit from Dorothy herself.","Fire and death forced park to close ten years after it opened in 1970 .

"Lined up next to their deadly shipment of bomb-making equipment and weapons, these four Taliban fanatics include a woman clad head to foot in a blue burka. It is believed she was travelling from Pakistan with a child – a ploy often used by insurgents to avoid detection. The group were arrested by police in Afghanistan as they tried to make their way in to the country on Thursday. Arrested: Four Taliban fighters, including a woman dressed in a full-length burka, stand handcuffed near seized weapons at the police headquarters in Jalalabad, eastern Afghanistan . Caught: The four Taliban militants - including a woman and a child - were arrested by Afgan border police at the Torkham border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan . Officers discovered they had been carrying an assault rifle and ammunition. The arsenal also included all the parts needed to construct improvised explosive devices (IEDs). It comes after Afghan Army officers secured a large stockpile of weapons and ammunition from various operations in Kabul and Logar Provinces from Taliban militants on Wednesday. Meanwhile, American officials claim the shrinking U.S. combat role in Afghanistan has given insurgents an opening to devise and carry out deadlier attacks using bigger improvised bombs against coalition military vehicles and bases. With fewer U.S. forces patrolling road networks beyond their bases - and with the grounding of eye-in-the-sky surveillance balloons known as aerostats - Taliban fighters are adapting their tactics, according to officials at a Pentagon agency that tracks attacks that use improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.

Organization, which has its own team of analysts on the ground in . Afghanistan. So while . the number of IED attacks against U.S. and coalition troops - as well as . the total casualties they cause - has declined, certain attacks can be . more elaborately planned, precisely targeted and more lethal because the . insurgents have time and room to prepare, Sweetser and other American . officials said.","The woman, three men and a child were arrested near the Torkham border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan .

Adding to the tribute filled program, Cold Chisel guitarist Ian Moss, serenaded Georgie with the Ray Charles hit Georgia On My Mind, as a photo montage of her time on the program rolled. To close, her husband Tim Baker and nine-year-old daughter Bronte and son Angus, seven joined the Today team on the couch for some last words. Angus said he was looking forward to eating chocolate with his mother and watching movies, because she always fell asleep watching movies with their father Tim. Getting their mother back! Her husband Tim Baker and children Bronte and Angus made a surprise appearance for their loved ones final show . Won't be so tired from now on: Seven-year-old Angus told his mother's colleagues that she always fell asleep while watching movies with their dad . Georgie revealed that when she told her children she was resigning they told her, 'Mummy that's great news.' She may be leaving Today but fans of Georgie Gardner will be relieved to know they haven’t seen the last of her on the Nine network. As well as filling in on Today from time to time, the news presenter will continue on the 6pm bulletin duties with Peter Overton. She will also take up the co-host chair on Mornings with David Campbell when Sonia Kruger moves to cover Big Brother later in the year. As well as this Gardner will contribute to 60 Minutes.Nine’s Director of News and Current Affairs, Darren Wick said of the presenters move: ‘Georgie is a much valued member of the Nine News team and we welcome the opportunity to have her professional presence in a range of new roles across the network, including reporting on 60 Minutes.' 'I'll always remember that moment.' 'I want to thank all of you,' she said one last time. 'You mean the world to me... you've been the most extraordinary colleagues.' She also gave a shout out to her colleagues behind the scenes, the 'angels in makeup', and the production team who she said were 'the bets in the business'. 'I'll be eternally grateful for how you've made me feel'. A special clip of Gardner's best moments kicked off the show on Friday morning, before the beautiful blonde treated to a special farewell breakfast by her co-presenter Karl Stefanovic to mark the momentous occasion. Sounds of sirens signaled the arrival of two NSW coppers to present the lucky lady with a delicious farewell breakfast of an egg and bacon McMuffin. The mother of two looked less than impressed and remarked, 'Jeez you never fail to surprise me Karlos.' While Lisa joked 'you really raided the petty cash for that one'. As cheeky Karl advised her it would help 'line her stomach' for later, obviously planning a big send off for the lovely lady. A fun montage took a look back at some of Australian beauties best bits, including some provocative references including 'massage balls', 'crack at my buns', 'long, pokey thing'. There were also touching tributes from her co-workers. 'She understands people and connects with people, that's what makes her the best newsreader in the country,' said Steven Jacobs . Not a dry eye in the house: Even Georgie's colleagues shed tears for the veteran news anchor as they reminisce about her time on the show . Real men cry: Sports reporter Ben Fordham and entertainment editor Richard Wilkins showed their sensitive sides during the flashbacks and tributes . She was all smiles: Cold Chisel guitarist Ian Moss serenaded Georgie with the Ray Charles classic Georgia On My Mind . While Richard Wilkins commended her 'wicked sense of humour'. When Gardner announced her departure late last month, she revealed that decision was motivated by wanting to spend more time with her family and be a 'present mummy, instead of grumpy mummy'. Gardner said: ‘I’m going to be finishing up, the time has come. I made this announcement with a very heavy heart.' However, she will remain with the Nine Network as a weekend newsreader, covering for colleagues Peter Overton and Lisa Wilkinson when they are on holidays, and taking over the co-hosting gig on Mornings with David Campbell when usual host Sonia Kruger is working on Big Brother. Describing crew and presenters of Today as 'family', she welled up and said her decision was down to the time commitment working on the show: 'The hours are grueling.' She added she would continue to watch the program even though she was no longer starring on it. Cheers to that! The Perth-born stunner formed a close friendship with Today host Lisa Wilkinson since they began working together . Out with a bang! The cast and crew popped a bottle of French bubbles to for the final hurrah, leaving a Champagne soaked set . Final breakfast: Karl Stefanovic surprised the 43-year-old with a McDonald's breakfast delivered by the Police . Earlier this week, Georgie revealed to Show And Tell that she was  'was desperately trying to have number three' and the loss 'really rocked me, absolutely rocked me.' 'Some women I know have miscarriages and are very accepting and say that’s OK, that’s nature taking its course,' she said, 'but, my god, it really took me to a very deep and dark place actually.' 'I’m sure at 39 weeks of course it would be a lot harder, it would be a lot more harrowing than nine or 10 weeks, which was what I was. '(But) it was still a life, and still a dream. It’s the possibility ... I wanted it so badly.' Her hair has undergone a revamp: Georgie joined the Today show seven years ago .

"Click here for all the stats and heat maps from MailOnline's Match Zone service . The swan dive in front of the Doug Ellis Stand was reminiscent of Jurgen Klinsmann throwing himself at the mercy of Tottenham’s supporters at Hillsborough 20 years ago. Harry Kane - ‘he is one of us’, as they sing - was more than entitled to launch himself in front of them after scoring Tottenham’s remarkable winner at Villa Park. He deserved it. Spurs, most certainly, did not. Mauricio Pochettino can hold an inquest into this shambolic performance at a later date, but the facts are that they overcame 10 man Villa to record their first league win in a month. They did it, partially, because Kane’s enthusiasm inspired some work-shy plodders in this Tottenham team after replacing Emmanuel Adebayor in the 57th minute. Adebayor didn’t fancy this one. Harry Kane is chased by his team-mates after scoring the winner in the last moments of the game at Villa Park . Kane's free-kick deflected off Nathan Baker's head and past Brad Guzan in the Villa net in the 90th minute . Kane, on as a substitute, scored the winner before diving in front of the travelling Tottenham supporters .

Referee: Neil Swarbrick 6 . Credit to Kane at the death because every Tottenham fan worldwide watching this game on television was screaming out for Erik Lamela to take the 90th minute free-kick. Kane demanded the ball off him and scored, thanks to a deflection from the unfortunate figure of Nathan Baker in Aston Villa’s wall. ‘Lamela and Kane were on the free-kicks but football is about emotion and confidence,’ admitted Pochettino. ‘He shot and he scored. It was a good decision. We are very happy because in every competition he scores.’ It will certainly take some explaining how Paul Lambert’s team, who scored for the first time in 547 minutes and were a man down when Christian Benteke was sent off, lost this game. This is six defeats on the spin for Paul Lambert’s team and they are only nine away from equalling Sunderland’s record of 15 in the Premier League, set in 2002/03, now. It could happen. At least Villa scored, though. Andreas Weimann, this willing workhorse down the right, finished the move after 16 minutes when he slid in to meet Charles N’ Zogbia’s deft, left foot touch. At that point, Tottenham were building up a head of steam towards their annual November crisis as they searched for their first Barclays Premier League victory since the streaky 1-0 win over Southampton on October 3. Tottenham’s defence, dreadful as it is, needs organisation, structure and discipline if they are to make their way back up the table. Benteke, who was subdued on his return to the team in the 2-0 defeat at QPR last Monday, had flashed an early header wide of Hugo Lloris’ goal. ‘They couldn’t handle him,’ claimed Lambert and he was right. He hit the crossbar with another, grafting outside the area and then spinning Tottenham’s defence (it didn’t take much, granted) to carve out the opening. Up front, Spurs need players who will take responsibility to score goals. Roberto Soldado, who score here last season, spooned an effort hopelessly high over Brad Guzan’s goal after Villa had taken the lead. Adebayor, through on goal in the first half, was stopped when Guzan timed his run perfectly to pinch the ball of his toes and sent it wide for a corner. You know things are bad at this club when the fans are demanding ‘we want Levy out’ just minutes before they got the substitution they craved: Harry Kane.

Christian Eriksen, substituted at the break for tactical reasons, was dreadful. ‘It was tactical,’ admitted Pochettino. ‘Sometimes you just need to change.’ Adebayor, also, was borderline disgrace. At one stage the captain Younes Kaboul had carelessly booted the ball high into the night sky from an innocuous cross. What is their problem? No-one knows. At that stage, it was easy to wonder whether Spurs would have the gumption to get themselves back into this game. Kane saw it differently, immediately directing a header into the arms of Guzan. The kid has spirit. Jan Vertonghen rose to the challenge and booked for a foul on Ashley Westwood after an hour, catching him with a stud when he came off a long run up to slid into the Villa youngster. Andreas Weimann wheels off after scoring Aston Villa's opener at Villa Park on Sunday against Tottenham Hotspur .

Danny Rose             90       11.0         6.8 . That led to confrontations all over the field and Benteke, who will be suspended for three games following his dismissal, was next in the frame. Ryan Mason was the one to call it on with the Villa forward, rutting with Benteke after a man-o-man squabble in front of the dug-outs. ‘I didn’t see it,’ claimed Pochettino. Wise words. Benteke shoved Mason and referee Neil Swarbrick, who failed to spot Roberto Soladado pushing Villa players around, sent him off. The Villa forward’s punishment is a three-game ban against West Ham, Southampton and Burnley. He deserves a degree of sympathy. That incident somehow provoked Tottenham, rattling them and their fans as they hurtled towards defeat. Incredibly, just when it looked like Pochettino and his team were making a pig’s ear of this game, Nacer Chadli equalised for them after 86 minutes. The Spurs midfielder was at the back stick to score, beating Brad Guzan with their best chance of the game. It was breathtaking stuff. That’s when the nerves set in around this stadium, with fans pacing up and down gangways as they willed this game to end at one-apiece. There was never any chance of that. Kane, this talismanic figure in a Tottenham shirt, sent the fans back down to London grinning from ear to ear after his remarkable winner. After this, he really is one of them.

"For most women it is a problem they hope to leave behind in their teenage years. But recent studies have revealed that more and more are suffering with embarrassing spots and pimples in adult life. Now a skin care treatment favoured by American celebrities, which claims to banish blemishes in days, is set to revolutionise the lives of acne sufferers when it is launched in Britain this week. The Proactiv range promises to leave skin looking healthier in just 14 days . The three 120ml bottles of Proactiv cleanser, toner and repair lotion claim to clear away spots and leave skin looking healthier in just 14 days. Formulated by two US female dermatologists, the solution contains salicylic acid, a natural plant extract which helps clear blocked pores by eliminating dead skin cells. It has more than 15 million customers in 60 countries and counts stars Katy Perry, Elle Macpherson, Justin Bieber, Alicia Keys and Avril Lavigne among its celebrity clients. Previously available on American websites only, the £39.99 treatment is expected to be a sell out when it goes on sale on the British High Street at Boots for the first time on February 15. The Proactiv website features singer Katy Perry who claims bad skin was a problem during her teenage years . Star attraction: Proactiv skincare counts (from left) Elle Macpherson, Justin Bieber and Avril Lavigne among its celebrity clients . Recent surveys have revealed that more than half of UK women over 30 struggle with spots or blemishes, while as many as 14 per cent are diagnosed with acne. Experts have found that the average age of those being treated for adult acne is also on the up. While in 1984 the average age of an acne sufferer was around 20, today they are more likely to be nearer 30. Acne occurs when the sex hormones - particularly the male hormone testosterone - become overactive and produce excess oil. These hormones are particularly rife during the teenage years, but a surge also occurs during pregnancy, IVF treatment and the menopause. Stress is also believed to be a trigger. Dr Kathy Fields, a dermatologist who co-created Proactiv, said: ‘We started noticing that is wasn’t just teenagers, but everybody - men and women in their 20’s, 30’s, 40’s and above - who suddenly started breaking out (with spots) for the very first time, due to hormonal changes, menopausal changes, stress and all kinds of factors in their lives. ‘Most of the blemish treatments you buy at the chemist are 'spot treatments', designed primarily to get rid of existing pimples and can be harsh and drying on the skin. ‘The Proactiv system is a combination system that’s gentle enough for different skin types and needs. As well as calming existing pimples and blackheads, it deals with breakouts before they start.’ More than 1,000 UK women tested Proactiv as part of an eight week clinical trial last year. Users apply the three stage solution – cleanser, toner and repair lotion – twice daily, morning and night. A staggering 88 per cent said they had less spots and 86 per cent said they had a clearer complexion – some in less than two weeks. Jackie Smith, 46, of Maidstone, Kent, began using Proactiv as part of a trial after she started getting spots because of the menopause. ‘I’ve had menopausal symptoms for over two years including hot flushes, sleep disturbance and blemishes,’ she said. ‘Whilst I put up with the flushes and insomnia I found the blemishes really embarrassing. Nothing seemed to work and everything I tried made my skin very sensitive. ‘A friend suggested I try Proactiv, the results were amazing. After two weeks I had a clear, brighter complexion and by using it every day I’ve not  had any more bad breakouts.’ Singer Katy Perry said she had tried everything to get rid of her acne before turning to Proactiv. ‘Blemishes really made me want to hide,’ she said. ‘I’d wear makeup to bed or stay in if I had a bad breakout. Since I started using Proactiv I’ve seen a massive change in my face and my confidence. I really believe in it.’","Katy Perry, Elle Macpherson and Justin Bieber among celebrity clients .

"At the start of the school day, teacher Lia Tsiklauri takes the register. But the morning task is over in a flash - because there's only one name to tick off. Bacho Tsiklauri, nine, is the only pupil at the primary school in the remote mountain gorge village of Makarta, Georgia, 62 miles north of the capital Tbilisi. He is one of only four children in the village, which is home to about 30 people. The older children, including his brother Dato, attend a high school in a nearby village two miles away. Nine-year-old Bacho Tsiklauri listens to his teacher Lia Tsiklauri, 47, during a lesson at school in the village of Makarta, Georgia . Makarta has only four children among its 30 residents. Bacho's older brother Dato is among the three who attend high school in a neighbouring village . Before school Lela Machkhashvili, 39, helps her son Bacho do his homework . Bacho waits at the window to see his teacher Lia Tsiklauri walking towards the school before setting off . Reuters photographer David Mdzinarishvili travelled along 12 . miles of dirt track through the Gudamakari gorge, which separates . Makarta from the rest of Georgia, to meet Bacho. The journey through the gorge took as long as it did to cover 50 miles on the main road. He found a village of abandoned . houses left behind by those who have left Makarta for better . opportunities in more developed areas of the country. The young boy wakes early and prepares breakfast at about 7am before doing homework with the help of his mother Lela Machkhashvili, 39. Dato has to leave earlier than his sibling to make the hour-long journey to high school. 'I used the remaining time before the beginning of the school day to try to get acquainted with Bacho,' said Mr Mdzinarishvili in a blogpost. 'I asked how he spent his spare time, . but he was just interested in my photography equipment: “What do you do . after school?” I asked. '“Nothing special. Can your camera shoot pictures of the top of that mountain?” he replied. Bacho packs his bag for the short journey to school. When he goes to high school, he will spend an hour getting there . Bacho's mother Lela watches as her son sets off for school down a winding path . Bacho walks to school, in the mountain gorge village Makarta, with his father Gia and the family's dog . Lessons take place in a room with four desks in a private home in Makarta . '“When you grow up, who do you want to be?” I continued. '“I don’t know. And your camera can shoot at night?” 'I gave up. We discussed my camera and Bacho even took a few shots.' Bacho knows it is time for lessons when he sees 47-year-old Ms Tsiklauri, who teaches Georgian and mathematics, walking past his house at about 10am each day. His father Gia does the school run with the aid of the family dog. Ms Tsiklauri also studied at the primary school, where lessons take place in a room with four desks and a wood stove on the second floor of a private house. Bacho works at the board while Lia Tsiklauri marks his work. The room is decorated with learning materials - and a poster of Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi . The class register bears only one name: Bacho Tsiklauri . The classroom has a low chalkboard on the wall for Bacho to do his work, which includes lessons in Georgian, English and mathematics . There are no other students to help Bacho out with his teacher's tough questions . Mr Mdzinarishvili, who went to meet Bacho, said: 'At the beginning, I saw that the . teacher and student didn’t feel comfortable with me being there: having a . third person in the class, and one with a camera, was an unfamiliar . situation. 'Lia began the lesson by taking the register, but then she laughed and with this the tension disappeared. 'They soon forgot about my presence, . and the class went as usual: checking homework, going over previous . lessons, being called to the board, and learning new material. 'Of course, it was always Bacho who . performed all the tasks, Bacho who answered all the questions, and Bacho . who came to the board. Bacho is the only pupil at the school and will also be its last . Break time is a lonely affair, with a half-flat football to kick around in the courtyard . His two teachers praise Bacho but say they are sad that the school will no longer exist once he goes to high school . 'He couldn’t get out of it, and there . was no one to whisper the answer if he didn’t know – although I don’t . think he needed the help.' At break time, Bacho kicked a half-flat football around the courtyard by himself and did a few laps, Mr Mdzinarishvili said. Then the boy's other teacher, 40-year-old Inga Chokheli, arrived for his English lesson. Both the teachers were full of praise for their only . student. They just had one disappointment: when he goes to high school, the primary . school in Makarta will close. Bacho and his father Gia pictured at home in Makarta .

"American scientists believe that Antarctica's largest and deepest underground lake could contain thousands of different tiny organisms and even fish. Scientists say that the icy darkness of Lake Vostok, which has been cut off from the outside world for 15 million years under 3,700 metres of ice, provides a glimpse of the planet before the Ice Age. Research from Bowling Green State University, Ohio, suggests that the lake harbours plenty of life from bacteria to complex organisms. Not only had most scientists believed Lake Vostok completely inhospitable to life, some thought it might even be sterile. Drilling into history: American researchers have found evidence of bacterial life in ice samples taken from Lake Vostock . After two years of computer analysis of DNA sequences from ice samples, the final results showed that Lake Vostok contains a diverse set of microbes, as well as some multicellular organisms. Over 3,500 DNA sequences were identified in samples of ice 'as clear as diamonds' extracted from the ice, of which 95 per cent were associated with types of bacteria. The remaining five per cent of the samples contained hints of more complex organisms called eukaryokes and two of them were linked to one-called organisms called archaea. Dr Scott Rogers, a Bowling Green State University professor of biological sciences and his team found sequences that are similar to types of fungi as well as water fleas, arthropods and a mollusk. Interestingly come of the bacteria are generally found in fish guts, suggesting that there could be fish in the subterranean lake, according to the research published in the PLOS ONE journal. Most scientists believed Lake Vostok (pictured from above) was completely inhospitable to life. But new research suggests that it contains a diverse set of microbes, as well as some multicellular organisms . 'The bounds of what is habitable and what is not are changing,' said Dr Rogers. Lake Vostok is located 800 miles from the South Pole and 35 million years ago, when the climate was warmer, was thought to have been open to the air and surrounded by forests. The researchers said: 'At that time, the lake probably contained a complex network of organisms.' They think that the organisms were sealed in the lake, which is around a quarter of a mile deep, by the thick ice approximately 15 million years ago. They said: 'While the current conditions are different than earlier in history, the lake seems to have maintained a surprisingly diverse community of organisms. 'These organisms may have slowly adapted to the changing conditions in Lake Vostok during the past 15 to 35 million years when the lake converted from a terrestrial system to a subglacial system.' Several of the sequences are similar to . organisms that live near deep sea thermal vents, leading researchers to . believes that Lake Vostok might contain similar features in its icy . depths. Dr Scott Rogers of Bowling Green State University found DNA sequences that are similar to types of fungi as well as water fleas, arthropods and a mollusk, from ice samples taken from Lake Vostok (research station pictured). He believes there could be fish and deep sea thermal vents in the lake . 'Hydrothermal vents could provide sources of energy and nutrients vital for organisms living in the lake,' the scientists said. Russian researchers suggested that a unique form of bacteria had been discovered in water samples from the 15 million year old lake. However, their findings were later said to be because of contamination. The American researchers were keen to say that they took great pains to prevent contamination of their samples and said that the various sequences were the type that many scientists expected to see in a subglacial lake. 'Most of the . organisms appear to be aquatic (freshwater), and many are species that . usually live in ocean or lake sediments,' Dr Rogers said.","U.S. scientists believe that Antarctica's largest and deepest underground lake could contain thousands of different tiny organisms and even fish .

"England are not suddenly favourites to regain the Ashes next summer. They are not favourites to beat Pakistan in the UAE soon after that, nor to win in South Africa in 2015-16. But, after going 1-0 down to India at Lord’s, they won the next three Tests as if they were playing the Bangladesh 2nd XI. For the time being they can take real pleasure in the transformation. Not all the problems have suddenly been solved. Alastair Cook’s three half-centuries in four innings needed generous helpings of luck. Sam Robson looks constipated. We don’t yet know how Chris Woakes will fare if the ball doesn’t swing. And Moeen Ali could do with some runs. Champagne moment: England's players soak Gary Ballance after victory at The Oval . But England deserve a slap on the back, not least for making India look that awful. The selectors stuck with Woakes and Chris Jordan, who finished the series with 10 wickets at 22, and Paul Downton never considered sacking Cook. At two points this summer, Downton may have wavered – for Cook himself certainly did, dissuaded from resignation by his wife, Alice. The first nadir was on the fourth evening at Headingley, after England had blown a near-impregnable position against Sri Lanka. The second was the Lord’s defeat by India. Both results were freakish in their own way. England may never again lose a home Test to Sri Lanka after leading by over 100 on first innings. And they may never again be outbowled by Indian seamers on a greentop. But the defeats said plenty about the post-Ashes state of mind, which veered between denial and despondency. That Downton stuck with Cook may tell us something about his own stubbornness – a quality the two men evidently share. Both will be quietly thanking their genetic make-up now. And yet both will know how much they owe to their new-ball pairing. At Southampton, Old Trafford and The Oval, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad shared 28 wickets at 13 apiece while conceding 2.2 an over. Both men were at their best: Anderson was snakingly word-perfect, darting it this way and that, with no discernible change of grip; Broad was remorselessly malevolent, despite only one good knee and a broken nose. They would have troubled better sides than India. Even so, the Anderson-Broad axis gives India an easy get-out clause: they can say they were beaten by English seamers in English conditions. Inconveniently, Moeen claimed 19 wickets at 23. Since Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin claimed 12 between them at 43, English spin has trumped Indian spin for the second Test series in a row – and this time without Graeme Swann or Monty Panesar. As much as anything, it was India’s laziness against Moeen that summed up their approach. Every time they tried to break free of England’s half-Nelson, the sense of strangulation grew. By the end, we were just hearing the same old tropes from MS Dhoni. Bowling them over: James Anderson (left) and Stuart Broad combined to devastating effect . Getting the job done: Joe Root (left) celebrates reaching his hundred at The Oval . VIDEO Root and Anderson thrilled with win . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . After England won in India in 2012-13, Dhoni was asked if the result represented a low point. No, he said: that was the 2007 World Cup, a comment that seemed indicative of India’s priorities. Yet when the question was put to him again on Sunday, he instead cited as his personal nadir India’s 4-0 defeat in England in 2011. But then, in Test cricket, he is collecting plenty of options. There were moments in this series when Dhoni fought hard with the bat, attempting to overcome a homespun technique and the deficiencies of his team-mates. But it remains a mystery, for which opponents are thankful, that he is still India’s Test captain. His decision to go on the defensive as early as the second session at Southampton felt like a surrender, as if he had forgotten the series consisted of five Tests, not three. His bowling changes were frequently weird. And he spoke enigmatically of the importance of ‘processes’, while waving a regal hand in the direction of mere ‘results’. Picture of misery: The India team after the final Test loss capped a woeful second half of the series . On Sunday evening, after acknowledging the suggestion that India’s players might benefit from a stint in county cricket, he was asked whether Virat Kohli would ever consider sacrificing the IPL for a spell with a shire. His answer came with a familiar passive-aggressive grin: ‘You’ll have to ask BCCI. Don’t be too jealous of IPL.’ It was a revealing response, for the question had conveyed no jealousy. Dhoni is said to earn $30million a year. Perhaps that’s what he had in mind. Alas, no amount of money could buy runs for Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli, and here we can finish with one final contrast. While those two – perhaps the most feted pair of young batsmen in the world game – scraped together one half-century in 20 innings, the eminently less glamorous couple of Gary Ballance and Joe Root managed four hundreds and five fifties from 14 innings. It doesn’t matter how much you earn or how sexy your cover-drive looks or even how much you scream in the face of vanquished batsmen. It matters how much you’re prepared to scrap. England lost 5-0 not so long ago. But at least English cricket, finally, was honest with itself. Feted: But no amount of money could buy Virat Kohli runs in England . THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . The wonder of Ravi . One of the most intriguing aspects of India’s meltdown were the logical contortions Ravi Shastri would find himself in each night on Sky’s Verdict show. Shastri has based his post-cricket career on clinging on to the BCCI’s greasy pole. It allows him many privileges but demands strict loyalty. Asked by Charles Colvile on Sunday whether MS Dhoni would have to consider his position, Shastri replied that this would only occur if India were badly beaten by England at home. What he can only have meant was ‘badly beaten by England at home twice’ – unless he feels a 10-wicket defeat at Mumbai followed by a seven-wicket loss at Kolkata don’t quite fit the bill. Still, greasy poles can be tricky beggars... Hales for Test cricket . Eoin Morgan believes Alex Hales ‘stakes a huge claim to be selected in all three formats’. Even though Morgan’s point comes with the caveat that he probably has the same view of his own batting, he is right. England have five Tests left before their next tilt at the Ashes – three in the Caribbean, two at home against New Zealand. And they should consider the course of action the Australians would least like them to take. Whirlwind: Alex Hales could be England's match-winner at the top of the order in Test cricket . Sam Robson is a determined player with serious limitations. It’s hard to see him winning you a Test match. But Hales, who is finally on the brink of his one-day international debut, has the potential to be England’s answer to David Warner – a hit-and-miss top-order whirlwind who can win you a game if he bats two sessions. England have taken the plunge with Jos Buttler, and nobody died. They can do the same with Hales. Elegant and effortless . Farewell, then, Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman of aching elegance whose 11,814 Test runs at a fraction under 50 would have qualified him for even more superlatives had he played for one of the sport’s superpowers. As it was, there could sometimes be a hint of condescension when it came to his place in the pantheon – bracketed below Muttiah Muralitharan, or alongside Kumar Sangakkara, when in fact he deserved a place all of his own. Waving goodbye: Mahela Jayawardene is chaired off by his Sri Lanka team-mates after his final Test . Jayawardene’s reputation as a gentleman was exaggerated. Though less obviously prickly than Arjuna Ranatunga, he was rarely less than flinty, and in a press conference at Leeds in June needed no invitation to dance on England’s grave. But it was his batting we’ll remember: effortless, second-gear, 30-on-the-board-before-you’ve-blinked. And, yes, an all-time great. The women trip up . Earlier this year at the England team dinner in the Lord’s Long Room, it was as if the 5-0 Ashes disaster had never happened. The focus, instead, was on the women, who had retained their urn thanks mainly to a memorable Test win at Perth. Now they have just lost a home Test to India. Witnesses say it did not make for encouraging viewing. The BCCI have virtually ignored women’s cricket, while the ECB have invested plenty. This was as bad as it gets.","Not all England's problems have been solved but they made India look awful .

"Like the rest of us, Bernard Gallacher has watched aghast at all the American antics since they lost in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. How many own goals is it possible for one team to score? The 65-year-old Scot, so steeped in Ryder Cup lore — eight times a player and thrice a captain — believes the US agony will be prolonged with ill-advised moves such as the appointment of a task force. ‘It will swing back America’s way if they don’t panic but that’s exactly what they seem to be doing,’ he said. ‘The task force just looks a publicity stunt to me. They lost the Ryder Cup because they lost the foursomes matches 7-1. How’s a task force going to help on that?’ Bernard Gallagher believes US agony will be prolonged with  moves such as the appointment of a task force . US team captain Tom Watson and Phil Mickelson stand together during a practice round at Gleneagles . Maybe the task force will be disbanded now the maverick behind it, PGA of America president Ted Bishop, has been unceremoniously fired after hurling social media insults at Ian Poulter that would have been unbecoming in a playground. ‘During my time they had presidents who kept in the background,’ said Gallacher. ‘Now they want to get involved and help but it has the opposite effect. ‘The Poulter spat was an undignified thing for a man in his position to get involved in, and his appointment of Tom Watson didn’t work either. There was clearly a generation gap between Tom and his players and it made for a marked contrast with Paul McGinley. He was one of the boys and they wanted to play for him.’ Phil Mickelson, of course, could hardly have made it clearer in the losing team’s press conference he did not want to play for Watson. Gallacher believes this was another spectacular own goal. He said: ‘Phil is a lovely guy, but it surely needed someone to tap him on the shoulder and say, “We all appreciate your passion and you’re trying to help, but your timing is completely wrong”. I would have been very disappointed if one of my players had done that. Phil must surely regret his actions in the cold light of day.’ Mickelson of the United States talks during a press conference after his team were defeated by Europe . What would Gallacher do if he was in charge? ‘I’d certainly get rid of the wildcards,’ he said. ‘I don’t know why they copied the Europeans on that one. We had to do it because a lot of our players were competing in America, but the Americans should just take the top 12 off their order of merit after the FedEx Cup. That way you’re letting every player know exactly what he needs to do to make the team. ‘They also need to stop over-reacting. The American college system is too strong not to turn out more great golfers. They were without key players in Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Jason Dufner. What a difference they would have made. ‘And look at Medinah, where they lost by a whisker, or Celtic Manor in 2010, where they won three of the four series of matches. They’re acting like they’re a million miles away.’ As for the Europeans, the only big decision looming is who should be captain in 2016. Gallacher is another who would plump for Darren Clarke over Miguel Angel Jimenez. ‘I look at Darren’s Ryder Cup record over Miguel’s, and his general standing in the game,’ he argued. And Gallacher himself? It is now 15 months since that fateful day when he suffered a cardiac arrest and was pronounced clinically dead, but thankfully he has made a full recovery. Darren Clarke of Ireland shares a joke on the 10th tee during the Pro-Am day at the Irish Open . He was back working for BBC 5 Live at The Open and the Ryder Cup and yesterday opened a comprehensive performance centre at the well-named World of Golf driving range at New Malden, London. ‘I’m fine. I’m back playing golf, going to the gym and driving again,’ he said. He and wife Lesley are also thinking over a Ryder Cup reunion of their own this winter. ‘Tony Jacklin and his wife Astrid have invited us to Florida to stay for a few days,’ he said. A Ryder Cup task force, then, that does make sense. QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time Ryder Cup points. Yours v His? Lil Girl.’ PGA of America president Ted Bishop takes Ian Poulter to task for having the temerity to stick up for a team-mate savaged by Sir Nick Faldo — and only succeeds in tweeting his own death warrant.

"Her childhood was made a misery by vicious school bullies. Hollie Robinson was punched, kicked and branded ‘ugly’. The campaign hit a particularly nasty low when she was sent an emailed petition containing 200 signatures urging her to kill herself. Every day for two years  Miss Robinson was targeted by her tormentors. She would be physically sick with fear each morning before leaving home  and suffer panic attacks on the school run. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Hollie aged 11 (left), when the bullying began; and Hollie now (right). Hollie said: 'I can't describe the hell I . went through when I was younger. I had . a big group of friends but they all just turned on me' Bullied: Hollie Robinson, 22, was kicked, punched and verbally abused every day at school for nearly two years but she's turned her life around and gone on to become a beauty queen and set up an Anti-bullying scheme . She was so scared she spent her . lunchtimes hiding in the school toilets.But she fought back against the . beatings and the insults to become an anti-bullying campaigner. And her confidence received a major . boost aged 17 when she was scouted at a clothes show by a woman . recruiting for Miss Blackpool in 2009. She was crowned queen in that . contest and went on to win a series of beauty pageants including Miss . West Lancashire in 2011 and Miss Blackpool in 2011. Miss Robinson, now 22, is hoping to go . into schools to tell children about the devastating effects bullying . had on her life in an attempt to help stamp it out. ‘I can’t describe the hell I went . through when I was younger,’ she said. ‘When I started secondary school, . I had a big group of friends but all of a sudden they just turned on . me. Winner: Hollie Robinson, pictured at Miss West Lancashire 2011 the Miss England Finals, which she says helped her overcome the years of bullying she suffered as a schoolgirl . ‘It grew worse and worse and soon I was the girl who everyone bullied. The other kids would call me ugly and say I was a dog. ‘I would be pushed around in the corridors and attacked in the school grounds. ‘I started coming home covered in . bruises, which I’d hide from my parents, and I’d spend each lunchtime . locked in the school toilets. ‘People would follow me home from . school so my mum started picking me up. At first I felt like my home was . my safe haven but then I started getting emails and messages on MSN . saying they were going to get me. I didn’t feel safe anywhere.’ Miss Robinson, from Blackpool, . continued: ‘One day I received  an email which was a petition with 200 . names on it saying  I should commit suicide. It said, “Who thinks Hollie . Robinson should kill herself?” I’m just so thankful that my mum was in . the house at the time because if she hadn’t been, I really think I might . have done something stupid.’ What was their motive? Hollie says that when she looks back now, she thinks the girls were just jealous. Some of the boys used to like her and she thinks maybe that's what started the bullying . Finding her feet: Hollie was visiting a clothes show at the age of 17 with her mother when she was scouted by a woman recruiting for Miss Blackpool Town in 2009 - and her modelling went from strength to strength . The petition proved a turning point. She told her parents the full story and never went back to the school. She started a new high school in Year 9, where she made many new friends. ‘I tried to put the years of bullying . behind me but I always lacked so much confidence,’ she said. ‘When . you’re told you’re ugly and worthless all the time, you start to believe . it. I felt like I wasn’t worth the air I breathed. ‘When I look back now I think they . were just jealous. Some of the boys used to like me and so  I think . maybe that’s what  started it.’ Champion: Hollie has reached the final of the Miss England contest on several occasions, and later this year will take part in the finals of Miss International and Intercontinental 2014 . Now Miss Robinson has a career as an . estate agent and she is setting up her own beauty pageant. She hopes the . online pageant called Miss Anti-Bullying, will raise awareness of the . plight of youngsters whose childhoods are destroyed by school bullies. Miss Robinson said she hopes her story will encourage other girls who are being bullied. ‘I feel like I’ve conquered the . bullies,’ she said. ‘Taking part in beauty contests has proved to me I . can do it. It has given me that confidence and has made me feel . comfortable with being me. Campaigner: Hollie's Miss Anti-Bullying pageant will raise money for the Beat Bullying charity through a Just Giving page . 'I’ve never looked back. I would like to go . into schools at some point and talk to girls about my experience of . bullying and show them you can be a good, positive role model.’ She says the online pageant will not be merely about judging people on their looks. Entrants will also be asked a series of questions about themselves and will be scored appropriately. The Miss Anti-Bullying pageant aims to raise money for the Beat Bullying charity, through a Just Giving page.

"A little sunshine could be good for your heart. A short, sharp blast from a tanning lamp can cause blood pressure to fall, scientists have found. The results suggest that well-meaning advice to avoid the sun to protect against skin cancer may in fact be raising the odds of  heart problems. Getting some sunshine can lower blood pressure and cuts the risk of heart attacks or strokes, according to a recent study at Southampton University . With high blood pressure trebling the . chance of heart attacks and strokes, researchers believe the benefits of . sunlight may outweigh the risks of skin cancer. The . study by experts at Southampton and Edinburgh Universities exposed the . skin of 24 healthy young men to a sun lamp for 20 minutes and measured . their blood pressure. Diastolic . pressure – the lower of the two figures in a blood pressure reading – . dropped significantly and remained low for at least half an hour after . the lamp was switched off. Studies . into sunlight usually credit vitamin D with any health benefits, but in . this case a different compound was at work. It is thought that the UVA . rays emitted by the lamp triggered the release of a compound called . nitric oxide from the skin. Researchers have found sunshine can alter levels of the small messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO), in the skin and blood, reducing blood pressure . It then travelled to the blood vessels and relaxed them, causing blood pressure to fall. The . researchers wrote in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology that even . a small drop in blood pressure cuts the risk of heart attacks and . strokes. Martin Feelisch, professor of experimental medicine at Southampton University, said: ‘Every little change might help.’ The . findings could help explain why rates of heart disease go up in the . winter – and why cardiac health is worse in countries further from the . equator. The professor said . it will be important to check that the benefits are not limited to a . quick blast of UV light in a lab but persist in the real world where . people are exposed to sunlight every day. If the sun’s rays do prove to . be beneficial for the heart, the professor said health advice on tanning . should be reviewed. He said that despite concern about skin cancer, heart disease is a far bigger killer. In . Britain, skin cancer kills  2,800 people a year while heart disease and . strokes claim more than 160,000 lives annually and every seven minutes . someone in the UK dies from a heart attack. Professor Feelisch said that . fear of skin cancer has left some people scared of the sun. Others may . not be getting enough sunlight because they spend their work and leisure . time indoors. The study involved exposing the skin of 24 healthy individuals to ultraviolet (UVA) light from tanning lamps for two sessions of 20 minutes each. The results suggest that UVA exposure dilates blood vessels and significantly lowers blood pressure . He added: . ‘Avoiding excess sunlight exposure is critical to prevent skin cancer . but not being exposed to it at all out of fear, or as a result of a . certain lifestyle, could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. We . are concerned that well-meaning advice to reduce comparatively low . numbers of deaths from skin cancer may inadvertently increase the risk . of death from heart disease and stroke.’ He added that his research  is too preliminary to advise people on how much sun they should be getting. n Sunshine can also ease the early stages of multiple sclerosis, a separate study found. MS is a neurological condition affecting around 100,000 people in the UK, causing problems with vision, balance and the bladder. Research . by Harvard School of Public Health published in online journal JAMA . Neurology found that boosting vitamin D could reduce the severity of MS. Alberto . Ascherio, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard, said: . ‘Because low vitamin D levels are common and can be easily and safely . increased by oral supplementation, these findings may contribute to . better outcomes for many MS patients.’","UK study found sunshine can change levels of the molecule, nitric oxide .

"The vessel that now holds the title of the world’s biggest ship has taken to the seas for the first time. Called Pieter Schelte, the behemoth can lift oil rigs right out of the water and move them to new destinations. It measures a staggering 1,253ft (382 metres) long and 407ft (124 metres) wide, making it almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall and wider than the height of Big Ben. Scroll down for video . The biggest vessel in the world has been built by Daewoo in South Korea. Swiss company Allseas commissioned the building of the huge $1.7bn ship. Both the legs and main structure of a rig can be moved simultaneously (shown in illustration) The giant catamaran-shaped ship was built by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea. Last week the world's largest cruise ship (above) arrived in the UK for the first time. The £800m ($1.3bn) Oasis Of The Seas sailed into Southampton at 10am last Wednesday in dense fog, welcomed by a crowd of hundreds and helicopters circling overhead. Weighing 225,282 tonnes, the 1,187ft (359 metres) ship is longer than London's The Shard is tall, and at 208ft (64 metres)  wide, larger than the wingspan of a Boeing 747. It cost £1.9 billion ($3.1 billion) to build and is powered by 11.2 megawatt engines connected to 13 Rolls Royce 5.5 megawatt thrusters, reports Gizmodo. Topsides - the upper section of oil rigs - weighing up to 48,000 tons can be lifted by the behemoth, while it will also be able to lift jackets - the legs - of rigs weighing up to 25,000 tonnes. The ship can then transport both the top and bottom sections of the oil rig simultaneously and take it back to port. It can even raise and lower itself in the water by 82ft (25 metres) in order to cope with the huge weight demands of moving an oil rig. Pieter Shelte, which will be operated by Swiss company Allseas, is expected to begin offshore operations next year. It can reach speeds of 14 knots (16.1 mph or 25.9 km/h) and has space for a crew of 571 people. Called Pieter Schelte (shown) it is almost as big as the Empire State Building. It will be used to pick up and move oil rigs from one place to another. It can reach speeds of 14 knots and hold a crew of 571 people. Allseas says it will enter offshore operations next year . When it enters operation it will also be the world's largest pipelaying ship and will be used to construct infrastructure under the sea. Its pipelay capacity of 2,000 tonnes is double that of the previous record holder, another Allseas ship called Solitaire. Pieter Shelte will only hold the title of the world’s biggest ship for six years, though; by 2020 Allseas expects to have an even larger vessel in operation to install and move bigger oil rigs. The Maersk Triple-E also built by Daewoo Shipbuilding still holds the record for the longest ship, though, at 1,312 feet (400 metres). How it measures up: While Pieter Schelte will be the largest ship in the world, it will not quite be as long as some other vessels . It measures a staggering 1,253 feet (382 metres) long and 407ft (124 metres) wide, making it almost as long as the Empire State Building (right) is tall and wider than the height of Big Ben (left)","The biggest vessel in the world has been built by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering in South Korea .

"A young woman with Asperger’s syndrome has beaten the bullies to bag a place as a UK finalist for the Miss Universe beauty crown. Lauren Lovejoy, 24, faced daily taunts that she was 'ugly and weird' - and was even pushed to suicidal thoughts. But now she is one of 38 women competing to become the Great Britain representative for the Miss Universe title. Lauren (left aged 13) suffered horrendous bullying throughout her childhood but now feels she has proved her tormentors wrong by reaching the final of Great Britain Miss Universe competition (right, Lauren today) Lauren said: 'I never thought I’d make it - there was a point when I believed every bad word the bullies threw at me. 'They broke my nose and shattered my confidence. In my lowest moments I thought I wanted to end my life. 'I thought that I really was as ugly and bad as they said.' Lauren, from Nottingham, entered the Miss Universe competition last year after seeing an advert online. Following an interview she was over the moon to discover she had been selected as a finalist. She said: 'The new opportunities I have been given through Miss Universe have opened my eyes - now I feel fantastic. The symptoms of Lauren's Asperger's syndrome made her a target for bullies at school (left, age 9, right,10) 'When I’m on stage it’s like I take on a different role and I am this confident and sassy young woman. 'I love to joke and laugh and I wanted that side of me to show. 'So when I was selected I really felt a sense of achievement that they picked me because they must have really liked me.'

But finds the unstructured nature of modelling and singing a creative release from her symptoms of anxiety and stress. Lauren said: 'I am very sensitive to sound and some smells too.

"Butterfly sightings quadrupled in  the summer heatwave compared to last year’s washout, a survey found. A record 46,000 volunteers spent 15 minutes a day noting 830,000 sightings in the Big Butterfly Count over three weeks in July and August. Most popular species were the small white and large white – both rising by 300 per cent – followed by peacocks, up by 3,500 per cent on last year. Most popular: Sightings of small and Large White butterflies (pictured) rose by 300% on last year's figures . Garden favourite the small tortoiseshell – in a worrying decline – was the sixth most-spotted species with a  rise of 388 per cent. Twelve species’ numbers rose by more than 50 per cent. Butterfly Conservation spokesman Richard Fox said: ‘We had a really good summer, which is positive for all parts of the butterfly life cycle. 'They’re cold-blooded creatures and their ability to be active in any sense, developing in an egg, feeding and growing as a caterpillar, developing as pupae or flying about as butterflies are all dependent on temperature.' He said the warmer weather meant they could go through their life-cycle faster and as adults were able to go about the process of successfully breeding. Second most common: Sightings of Peacock butterflies rose a remarkable 3,500 per cent on last year . This year’s good results showed that butterflies were resilient and could thrive given good weather and suitable habitats, he said. Several species saw numbers fall back after doing well last year, including ringlet and marbled white, meadow brown and six-spot burnet moths. Mr Fox said the four species all have a single generation each year, and so low numbers this year are likely to be the result of last year’s poor breeding season. The poll was promoted by actress Joanna Lumley for Marks & Spencer. She said: 'Butterflies are magical creatures that are crucial to our environment and this year’s count success shows that by giving up just 15 minutes of our time we can all play our part to help secure their future.'

"Donald Sterling gave testy, bombastic testimony Tuesday as he challenged the sale of his Los Angeles Clippers. Contending he's mentally sound, the 80-year-old sparred with his wife's lawyer and drew repeated laughter from spectators. 'Tell me what you want to accuse me of. ... Stand up and be a man,' he told attorney Bert Fields during a 90-minute afternoon appearance. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Shelly Sterling, the wife of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, arrives at a Los Angeles courthouse for a trial over the $2 billion Los Angeles Clippers sale on Tuesday, July 8, 2014, in Los Angeles . The billionaire also called doctors who've declared he has Alzheimer's disease 'hired guns,' pleaded a faulty memory about some of his most controversial remarks and declared he could top the $2 billion offer for the Clippers by $10 billion by selling TV rights to Fox and winning an antitrust suit he's filed against the NBA. 'What do you think, I'm doing this for ego?' he asked Fields. 'Yes,' the attorney replied. 'Well, you're wrong, like you're wrong with all your questions,' Sterling said. He also repeatedly told the soft-voiced Fields that he couldn't hear him, but at one point also said he was a good lawyer. As Sterling made continued outbursts, Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas tried futilely to take control of the situation, at one point telling him: 'Go back to answering questions rather than making somewhat entertaining comments.' After court, Fields said those who watched Sterling could easily draw their own conclusions on his competence. Angry: Donald Sterling, pictured in 2010, gave testy, bombastic testimony Tuesday as he challenged the sale of his Los Angeles Clippers . Target: Bert Fields, center left Tuesday, an attorney for Shelly Sterling, was the target of Donald Sterling's combative testimony . 'Is this a guy you'd employ to sell hamburgers?' Fields said. The NBA has moved to oust Sterling from team ownership because of racist remarks he made to a girlfriend. His lawyers are challenging the authority of Shelly Sterling under a family trust to unilaterally cut a deal for the team with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. In order to be able to make the deal herself, Shelly Sterling had two doctors examine her husband and they declared him mentally incapacitated and unable to act as an administrator of The Sterling Family Trust, which owns the Clippers. Sterling angrily denied that on the witness stand. 'When I went to the Cleveland Clinic, they told me I was razor-sharp. I have five corporations and I run them every day,' he said. Sterling acknowledged that he had offered to allow his wife to negotiate the sale at one point, but that was when he believed she would retain an interest in the team. 'I wanted to keep the team. I didn't want to sell it,' he said. Trial: Shelly Sterling arrives at a Los Angeles courthouse for a trial over the $2 billion Los Angeles Clippers sale on Tuesday, July 8, 2014 . Despite his challenge, Sterling repeatedly defended his wife and during a break before giving testimony, he pulled her down to his chair for a kiss. She wiped away a tear. 'I trust her today,' Sterling said on the stand. 'The reason we're here is because she's afraid of this big NBA that's trying to take everything away.' At times, he sniffled and appeared to wipe away a tear. A neurologist hired by his wife testified Monday that she believed he has Alzheimer's disease and a psychiatrist also hired by Shelly Sterling testified Tuesday that he drew the same conclusion after examining Sterling in May. Dr. James Sparr said Sterling was friendly, relaxed and cooperative until a final question challenged his abilities. A frustrated Sterling then said, 'I have to go,' and walked out of the room, Sparr said. Sparr's report concluded that Sterling showed early signs of the debilitating mental condition and concluded that 'he is substantially unable to manage his finances and resist fraud and malfeasance and is no longer competent to act as a trustee of his trust.' NBA owners are scheduled to vote on the Ballmer deal on July 15. It's also the day that Ballmer's offer is set to expire - and there is no deal without the judge's approval of the sale. If the sale isn't completed by September 15, the league said it could seize the team and put it up for auction.

As they hunted for arsonists and pitch invaders at White Hart Lane, Tottenham may have unearthed something far more valuable to Mauricio Pochettino: a turning point for the season. Most teams in the Barclays Premier League are searching for the same thing, such is the inconsistency around the country, but the Spurs boss has conjured his third wins in eight days. And this one seemed more significant than those against Partizan Belgrade and 10-man Hull City. This was a team proving to their manager they had spirit to respond after going behind early to a goal by Kevin Mirallas. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Tottenham 2-1 Everton .

SUPER STAT: This was Roberto Soldado’s third goal from open play in 35 Premier League appearances since his £26million move from Valencia. He also has four penalties. They displayed great desire and energy in midfield to reverse the flow of the game and the grit to defend once Christian Eriksen and Roberto Soldado had turned it upside down. For Soldado it was his first Premier League goal since March, and for Spurs a third home-win of the league campaign with three Academy graduates in their starting line-up. That trio: Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb contributed greatly to the tempo and industry which underpinned a victory and eased Tottenham up to seventh, level with Arsenal. There was a slice of fortune when Federico Fazio used an arm to block a goal-bound header from Romelu Lukaku during a frantic closing phase, and it went unnoticed, much to the annoyance of Roberto Martinez. 'Fazio makes himself really big and closes his eyes and he’s in a unusual position when it hits him,' fumed Martinez. 'If it hits him in the chest, no complaints, but it hits him in the arm and it should have been a penalty. 'I’m disappointed because Michael Oliver is a very good referee. It’s a real shame. This season, we haven’t been rewarded for good performances at Leicester, Manchester United and here. There are points we need to get back. But I would never blame a third party or the referee. We should be good enough to come to White Hart Lane and rely on ourselves.' Martinez had seen his team take control in the 15th minute, with a beautiful curling shot by Mirallas when Spurs failed to clear a free-kick swung over from the left by Leighton Baines. Mason headed out but only to the edge of the penalty area where Soldado lost a duel with Mirallas, who promptly set the ball on his right foot and bent a shot into the far corner. Everton might have been ahead earlier in the game when a Gazza-style dribble by Ross Barkley was smothered on the edge of the penalty box, only for the ball to spill to the feet of Romelu Lukaku in front of goal. Lukaku, wanted by Spurs when he left Chelsea in the summer, might have been offside but the flag stayed down. He hurried his shot and Hugo Lloris saved without fuss. Spurs reacted well with great energy from their home-grown trio and were level within six minutes. Again it was a delightful finish, this time by Eriksen, but the goal owed much to Kane’s determination to threaten the goal. Kane who cut in from wide on the Tottenham right, into space cleverly vacated by Soldado and unleashed an effort which took a slight deflection and flashed across the slick surface. Tim Howard could not hold it and Eriksen was first onto the rebound, clipping a skilful finish over the Everton goalkeeper and Gareth Barry who had made ground to cover on the goal line. Harry Kane was instrumental for Tottenham, particularly in the first-half as his hard work earned Spurs their two goals .

Gareth Barry               90            12.0       7.5 . Seamus Coleman       90            11.4       7.1 . Spurs dominated until half-time with patches of attractive football. Howard thwarted Mason and Kane, while Eriksen went close with a deflected shot. Then a poor header by Muhamed Besic, intended for his goalkeeper, fell short. Soldado had anticipated the error but his touch did not match his instinct and Besic escaped. It seemed like it might be another of those days for Tottenham’s £26million Spaniard: culpable in Everton’s opener and able to do little right at the other end, when he struck, in first-half stoppage time. Kane caught Barry deep in his own half, dithering in possession, and hooked the ball from him. Martinez wanted a free-kick but it would have been harsh. Aaron Lennon played in Soldado and this time his finish was clinical, past Howard and inside the post. Soldado has managed to remain dignified through his months of struggle in North London and supporters have refused to turn on him. As he headed down the tunnel at half-time, his name was ringing around White Hart Lane. 'The striker who doesn’t score is frustrated,' said Pochettino. 'It’s not easy and he felt the pressure but now he is happier and more free. It’s important to the team.' Although they rode their luck at times, Everton stirred and summoned a bold finish, with Barkley proving increasingly influential.

Then came the penalty appeal for a Fazio handball, but Tottenham clung on and were cheered off by fans who have been critical at times this season. 'I understand why our supporters have been angry,' said Pochettino. 'If you lose four at home, it is difficult for them to be happy. You win away and lose at home is not the right way. But today the team have sent a different signal. We played in good style. We must keep this feeling and mentality. 'This is the aggression we want. It was important to get this victory. For me, it’s not only three points - it’s a little bit more.' Sportsmail's Graham Poll gives his verdict on the refereeing talking points at White Hart Lane . 'Michael Oliver had two big penalty calls in the closing minutes. 'The first, with current interpretation should have been a spot kick for Everton as Federico Fazio handled, the ball hitting his arm with the defender in an unnatural position. Federico Fazio (21) appears to handle the ball inside the area from Romelu Lukaku's header late on at White Hart Lane . Everton had a right to feel aggrieved that they weren't awarded a penalty, with Fazio clearly handling . 'Minutes later Harry Kane was through and went down under a challenge from Muhamed Besic.

"International drug baron Alan Sibley, aged 56, was jailed after being tracked down to a Mexican hideaway following an escape from a UK prison . An international drugs baron was jailed today despite fleeing to Mexico after escaping from prison in the UK. Alan Sibley, 56, who lived in Lightwater, Surrey before going on the run, was imprisoned for 23 years after a complex operation to nail him spanned three continents and more than 10 years. Investigators found hundreds of thousands of pounds of cash and several kilograms of cocaine at his home. Some of the cocaine discovered had been cut with a sugar product. A spokesman from Surrey Police said Sibley’s illegal hauls, worth up to £1million pounds that was destined for the UK’s streets was hidden inside tables, sinks and furniture as it made its way across oceans. Sibley, was found guilty of conspiring to import cocaine into Britain following his extradition from Mexico. He was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court following a two week trial after he denied conspiring to import class A drugs but admitted escaping lawful custody. Sibley had been charged with conspiracy to import class A drugs and escaping from lawful custody in 2005 following a lengthy and extensive Surrey Police investigation. Around £1million worth of drugs were seized in the raid on Mr Sibley's home. He later escaped from jail and fled to Mexico . A spokesman said that Sibley was originally arrested by officers at an address in Lightwater in April 2001 as part of a covert Surrey Police investigation. A search of Sibley’s home address at the time led to officers recovering 2.61 kilograms of cocaine and several metal presses, each containing one kilogram blocks of cocaine, which had been mixed with a pharmaceutical sugar product and just over £340,000 pounds in cash. Police uncovered a £1million haul of drugs, including this plant pot which was hiding white power . Sibley was later arrested and on November 26 2001 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison at Guildford Crown Court, having admitted possession of a class A drug with intent to supply, part way through the trial. However Sibley absconded from prison four years later - in April 2005 - and subsequently fled from the UK and eventually set up residence in Mexico. An arrest warrant was later issued for Sibley for escaping from lawful custody and he was listed as one of Surrey Police’s Most Wanted offenders. Mr Sibley arriving back in UK after escaping from jail and fleeing to Mexico . The spokesman said that in 2006 Surrey Police was notified that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Cincinnati, Ohio, had intercepted a drugs consignment destined for the UK, where cocaine had been hidden inside a table. The Surrey Police Serious and Organised Crime Unit was subsequently able to identify a further 17 consignments which had been shipped to the UK over a three year period where drugs had been hidden in baths, sinks and metal tables. The police spokesman said that further inquiries and a forensic examination of the drugs packages hidden in the consignments led to Surrey Police finding evidence which directly implicated Sibley in the drug importation operation. Police then worked closely with the US and Mexican authorities and HM Revenue and Customs to trace where the consignments originated. In November 2012 Sibley was arrested by local authorities in Mexico and in February this year officers from Surrey Police’s Extradition Team flew to Mexico City to bring him back to the UK. Surrey officers arrived back at Heathrow Airport with Sibley on February 28 this year. Detective Inspector Ben Lee said: 'I welcome today’s lengthy custodial sentence for Sibley which marks the culmination of an extensive and complex investigation into an international drug smuggling operation. 'Sibley’s return to the UK was only possible thanks to years of hard work from a number of agencies and co-operation from the Mexican authorities; to whom we are extremely grateful. 'After escaping from the UK in 2005 Sibley, working with a number of associates, quickly established a sophisticated and highly organised operation to import dangerous drugs into the UK.' Sibley was sentenced to 22 years for the drugs offense and a further 12 months for the prison escape.","Alan Sibley, 56, was tracked down by authorities at his Mexican hideout .

'As for who I’d have in my team, that’s a tough one,' the former England international said during his latest edition of Tackle Keown. 'I think Suarez is a better player, though. When Costa played for Spain at the World Cup he was non-existent almost, because he wasn’t emotionally fired up. 'He needs an edge to get himself playing whereas Suarez came back from a serious knee operation and still showed how much quality he had.

"Louis van Gaal has delayed his decision on whether to buy Radamel Falcao because of the latest injury to the Manchester United striker. Falcao has endured a difficult start to his life at Manchester United, scoring just one goal in five appearances since his dramatic deadline-day loan move from Monaco. The striker has struggled for fitness and is yet to complete a full game for the Red Devils. VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal get frustrated with journalists over Falcao . Radamel Falcao has had a stuttering start to life as a Manchester United player, only featuring five times . Falcao has had to settle for watching on from the stands, and was pictured at Craven Cottage last week . The Colombian has been unavailable for the last month because of a calf injury he sustained in training and it will take at least another fortnight for him to return to action. United are yet to take up the option to buy Falcao because of his latest injury, which comes 10 months after he damaged cruciate ligaments playing for Monaco. 'Do you think we expected he'd be injured for so many weeks? Because of that (injury setback) maybe we didn't buy him,' the United manager said. Falcao is one of the club's top earners, but his only meaningful contributions on the pitch so far have been an assist for Robin van Persie's goal against Leicester and his own strike in the victory over Everton.

When asked whether he expected to be justified in his decision to sell Danny Welbeck and loan Falcao, Van Gaal said: 'I hope so. That is clear, I think.' Welbeck will be looking to prove a point when he faces the team he supported as a boy for the first time on Saturday. Danny Welbeck (centre) is preparing to face the club he has supported since a child for the first time . Van Gaal has defended his decision to sell Welbeck, pictured scoring for Arsenal, in the summer . Welbeck has scored five goals for Arsenal and the same amount for England since he last pulled on a United shirt. Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have scored just three goals for United apiece. Van Gaal stands by his decision to sell the United Academy product, who grew up in Longsight, just four miles away from Old Trafford. He said: 'We have Van Persie and (James) Wilson, and when you keep Welbeck, you don't give any chances to youngsters. That's also our philosophy, to give opportunities to youngsters. 'And then also we could buy Falcao. So (if) that is not enough reason, then I don't know - I'm not a very good manager,' Van Gaal said. 'For him it was a very good decision because as a line-up player he develops himself much more. 'If it was right for Manchester United is dependable on how they play, how they score and in what position we shall finish in the league.' Welbeck has scored against Arsenal for Manchester United, but will attempt to do the opposite . Welbeck (left) climbed up through the ranks at Manchester United until his move to Arsenal this summer . Van Gaal denied he gave up on Welbeck, insisting he was not the first United boss to omit the striker from the starting XI. 'Here, Danny Welbeck did not play every match. He was not a line-up player; he was more substitute than line-up,' Van Gaal said. 'With different coaches not a line-up player, then came Mr van Gaal and the world is changing? No, the world is not changing - the facts are not my facts, they're the facts of Danny Welbeck.' A win at the Emirates would be a big boost for United, who lost at Manchester City and drew at home to Chelsea in their most high-profile games so far this term. 'It is remarkable,' Van Gaal said when he was reminded he is still searching for his first away win with the club. Earlier this week Van Gaal's boss Ed Woodward told club investors it would be unlikely the club would sign anyone in the January transfer window. 'We are not looking to enter the market for short-term fixes,' said the executive vice-chairman, who was speaking on the day United posted a 9.9 per cent fall in revenue. Van Gaal has no qualms with Woodward's words. 'I agree with that because if you buy, it has to be a player who is better than what you have in your squad. It shall be very difficult to find such a player,' he said. 'We are speaking the same language.'","Radamel Falcao has struggled with injuries since joining Man United .

"The first of four rare 'blood moon' eclipses is set to happen tonight. The event, known as a 'Tetrad', is believed to mark the the beginning of significant events - even the second coming of Jesus Christ to a Christian minority. However, for the rest of us, it means a unique spectacle as a total lunar eclipse tonight will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange. Scroll down for video . Saturday’s total lunar eclipse, which will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange, will be visible in in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. A previous total lunar eclipse as seen from Mexico city on December 21, 2010 is pictured . The four blood moons will occur in roughly six-month intervals on the following dates: . April 15, 2014 . October 8, 2014 . April 4, 2015 . September 28, 2015 . The significance of the arrangement is that it . happened exactly a week before the first of four dark red 'blood moons,' which some Christians believe marks a cycle associated with the end of . the world. Although lunar eclipses happen multiple times in a year during a full moon, this eclipse will be a particularly unusual viewing opportunity for North America. Since the Earth's Western Hemisphere will be facing the moon during the eclipse, the continent will be in prime position to view it from start to finish. In addition, the eclipse will coincide with nighttime in North America. The entire continent won't be able to witness a full lunar eclipse in its entirety again until 2019. 'Sometimes they'll happen and you'll have to be somewhere else on Earth to see them,' said Noah Petro, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. 'Most [residents] of the continental United States will be able to see the whole thing.' For those who are awake to watch the eclipse, which is scheduled to begin around 2:00 a.m. EDT and last over three hours, Petro said there would be several changes people can witness. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow will begin creeping across the moon. This will give the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. 'Eventually there will be a chunk of darkness eating the moon,' Petro said. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. The eclipse is scheduled to begin around 2:00 a.m. EDT and last over three hours. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow will begin creeping across the moon. This will give the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. At the eclipse's peak, around 3:45 a.m. EDT, the moon will enter the Earth's full shadow, the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere will scatter the sun's red visible light, the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light will reflect off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it. It's not often that we get a chance to see our planet's shadow, but a lunar eclipse gives us a fleeting glimpse. During these rare events, the full Moon rapidly darkens and then glows red. Though a lunar eclipse can be seen only at night, it's worth staying up to catch the show. At the eclipse's peak, around 3:45 a.m. EDT, the moon will enter the Earth's full shadow, the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere will scatter the sun's red visible light, the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. No show: The total eclipse is visible over most of North America, but not in most of Europe, Africa and Asia, as explained by this map . As a result, the red light will reflect off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it. 'It's a projection of all the Earth's sunsets and sunrises onto the moon,' Petro said. 'It's a very subtle effect, and if any part of the moon is illuminated in the sun, you can't really see it.' 'They don't happen all the time, and the sky has to be clear,' Petro said. 'It really gives you a chance to look at the moon changing.' However, some believe the eclipse has larger significance. The unusual alignment of the sun, Earth and Mars happened a week before the beginning of the astrological event that some believe is associated with the end of the world . John Hagee, a Christian pastor who has . written a book on the Tetrad called 'Four Blood Moons: Something is . About to Change' told the Daily Express that Tuesday night marked the dawn of a 'hugely significant event' for the world. 'This is not something that some religious think tank has put together,' the notoriously outspoken church founder said. 'Nasa has confirmed that the Tetrad has only happened three times in more than 500 years — and that it's going to happen now.' Also known as the . 'Tetrad', since it involves four successive total 'blood-red' lunar . eclipses each followed by six full moons, Nasa has confirmed it started . Tuesday night and will end on September 28, 2015. In the 21st century, tetrads are a frequent occurrence, with nine sets in total, but this has not always been the case. From 1600 to 1900, for example, there were none at all. The 'Tetrad,' cycle began in April last year. It involves a series of four dark red 'blood moons.' At the end of the cycle in September 2015, some believe the end of the world will happen . The Book of Joel in the King James Bible prophesied about the blood moons and the end of the world: 'The . sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the . great and the terrible day of the LORD comes.' According to Mr Hagee, each time the Tetrad has happened during that time, there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it. In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The . second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded. And the most recent one, in 1967, happened during the Six-Day War . between Arabs and Israelis. This graphic explains why Mars was so visible to the naked eye on Tuesday night . Mr Hagee said the the first of the blood moons will happen on April 15, right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. The second, on October 8, occurs during the Feast of the Tabernacle. The third will be on April 4, 2015, also during Passover. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, also during the Feast of the Tabernacles.","Eclipse will begin tomorrow morning at  2 a.m. EDT .

"An amateur astronomer has said he got the shock of his life when he made Ireland's second discovery of a supernova (exploding star) in less than two years. Dave Grennan was stargazing from his back garden in Raheny, north Dublin when he spotted the 123 million-year-old spectacle in the sky. 'I had the shock of my life,' said the 41-year-old. 'I was about to pack up and go to bed and the very last photo I took I downloaded and I nearly fell off my chair. 'I couldn't believe it.' Dave Grennan (left) and his wife Carol in an observatory in their back garden in Raheny, north Dublin where he spotted a supernova . 'I knew exactly what it was. It wasn't a piece of dust on my camera, it was a supernova.' The software developer, who works for state transport company CIE, discovered the first supernova from Ireland using the same powerful telescope in September 2010. Mr Grennan said his latest find, on Monday August 22, is a tribute to his hero, moonwalker Neil Armstrong who died on Saturday. He said he sat up until 4am examining his data and searching records to check if anyone else in the world reported the star, before contacting the International Astronomical Union which formally designated the celestial explosion as 2012ej. Experts told him that the star was 100 times bigger than the sun and violently exploded in another galaxy, called IC2166, because it got too big and could not support its own weight. 'It is about 120 million light years away. 'That means it has taken 120 million years for the light from this explosion to travel the distance across the depths of the universe and reach us here on planet earth,' Mr Grennan said. 'So we are looking back in time.' Undated Raheny Observatory handout photo of the second ""supernova'' exploding star discovered in less than two years by amateur astronomer Dave Grennan. Mr Grennan described his love of the night sky as a vocation, and the support of his wife Carol unwavering. Four years ago he discovered an asteroid, a minor planet just three metres-wide, and named it after his late mother Catherine Griffin who encouraged his interest in the stars when he was a boy. The member of Astronomy Ireland and Pete Lawrence from the BBC's Sky at Night will speak at the organisation's star party in Roundwood, Co Wicklow next month. David Moore, editor of Astronomy Ireland magazine, said a supernova is the biggest explosion in the universe, after the Big Bang. 'It would be like billions of earths exploding all at once in an unimaginably violent event that would wipe out all life on our planet if it happened to any of the stars near our sun,' he said. 'To discover such an event, not to mention two, from Irish soil is a truly remarkable feat.'","Discovery is second major find of an exploding star for 41 year old Dave Grennan .

"Images uncovered by the son of a film stills photographer captured actress Lauren Bacall as the doting wife and mother who travelled to Africa to be with her husband Humphrey Bogart while he was filming the classic movie The African Queen. In 1951, two of the biggest names in Hollywood, Bogart and Katherine Hepburn, followed director John Hutson to possibly one of the most un-Hollywood locations - a jungle around the Ruki River in the Belgian Congo which is today known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Actress Lauren Bacall, who died on Tuesday at the age of 89, flew out to be near her husband Bogart who played Charlie Allnut, a hard-drinking riverboat captain in the First World War romantic comedy adventure. Scroll down for video . Lauren Bacall visiting Humphrey Bogat on the set of The African Queen: Arthur Lemon was the stills cameraman for the film and became good friends with the stars . Photographer Arthur Lemon was there too and captured the stars and crew between takes on the often dangerous shoot. His photographs offer an insight into the making of The African Queen and the close relationship between Bogart and Bacall. Mr Lemon's son Chris found the collection of stills yesterday after the announcement that Bacall had died after suffering a stroke in New York. He said: 'My dad worked as a stills photographer and this was one of about 70 films he covered. 'He spent several months out there and became very good friends with Bogart, Bacall and Katherine Hepburn. 'I remember him telling me that Bogart and Bacall were very close. Lauren Bacall on the set of The African Queen to meet Bogart. The film told the story of a prim missionary and a gruff adventurer, the captain of the African Queen . 'Bacall had travelled out to see Bogart and spent several weeks out there on location with their son. 'My dad would always come back with lots of stories. 'There . were a few close encounters with crocodiles and hippopotamuses while . filming The African Queen but I understand they had a lot of fun and . partied as best they could given the conditions. 'It was quite treacherous. They were working in difficult conditions. There were people with rifles to protect the crew, actors and actresses. It was a jungle after all where there were things that could eat you.' Actress Lauren Bacall, who died on Tuesday at the age of 89, flew out to be near her husband Bogart who played Charlie Allnut in The African Queen . It was after hearing the news that Bacall had died that Arthur's son dug out the photo albums. 'We knew she was out there with Bogart but these photos have been tucked away for years. 'The African Queen may have featured as a small part of Lauren Bacall's life but her time with Bogart was a major part of her life' Arthur Lemon got into photography by accident and started taking pictures with a cheap camera at a young age. 'It blossomed from there', his son said. 'In 1944 he was in Burma and was appointed combat photographer travelling throughout south east Asia. Many examples of his work are on display at the Imperial War Museum. 'After the war he became a photographer for a national newspaper before becoming a stills photographer in the film industry. Doting: Lauren Bacall photographed by Arthur Lemon with her son (left) and on the set of The African Queen (right) Chris said: 'It's like anything you hang onto. If something crops up you get them out. In this case the death of Lauren Bacall brought things back into focus. I wish I spoke to him a bit more about them now.' Bacall was a movie star from almost her first moment on the silver screen. A fashion model and bit-part New York actress before moving to Hollywood at 19, Bacall achieved immediate fame in 1944 with one scene in her first film, To Have and Have Not. Leaving Humphrey Bogart's hotel room, Bacall — a lanky figure with flowing blond hair and a stunning face — murmured: 'You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.' With that cool, sultry come-on, not only was a star born, but the beginning of a legend, her title burnished over the years with pivotal roles, signature New York wit, and a marriage to Bogart that accounted for one of the most famous Hollywood couples of all time. The Academy-Award nominated actress received two Tonys, an honorary Oscar and scores of film and TV roles. But, to her occasional frustration, she was remembered for her years with Bogart and treated more as a star by the film industry than as an actress. Bacall would outlive her husband by more than 50 years, but never outlive their iconic status. They were 'Bogie and Bacall' — the hard-boiled couple who could fight and make up with the best of them. She was less than half Bogart's age, yet as wise, and as jaded as he was. They starred in movies Key Largo and Dark Passage together, threw all-night parties, palled around with Frank Sinatra and others and formed a gang of California carousers known as the Holmby Hills Rat Pack, which Sinatra would resurrect after Bogart's death. Not until 1996 did she receive an Academy Award nomination — as supporting actress for her role as Barbra Streisand's mother in The Mirror Has Two Faces. Although a sentimental favorite, she was beaten by Juliette Binoche for her performance in The English Patient. She finally got a statuette in November 2009 at the movie academy's Governors Awards gala. Photographer Arthur Lemon was on the set of The African Queen and captured the stars and crew between takes . Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske in the Bronx on Sept. 16, 1924 and was raised by her Romanian immigrant mother after her parents split when she was a child. As a young woman, Diana Vreeland, the famed editor of Harper's Bazaar, thought she was ideal for fashion modeling, and Bacall appeared regularly in the magazine. The wife of film director Howard Hawks saw her on a magazine cover and recommended her as film material, and she went to Hollywood under a contract. Hawks became her mentor, coaching her on film acting and introducing her to Hollywood society. He was preparing a movie to star Bogart, based on an Ernest Hemingway story, 'To Have and Have Not,' with a script partly written by William Faulkner. By this time she had acquired the professional name of Lauren, though Bogart and all her friends continued to call her Betty. In By Myself, she wrote of meeting Bogart: 'There was no thunderbolt, no clap of thunder, just a simple how-do-you-do.' Bacall was best known for acting opposite her husband, Humphrey Bogart, in several 1940s classics including The Big Sleep, Key Largo and Dark Passage . On her first day of shooting, her hands were shaking so much that she couldn't manage a simple scene of lighting a cigarette. Work led to romance. The 23-year age difference (he called her ""Baby"") failed to deter them, but they faced a serious obstacle: Bogart was still married to the mercurial actress Mayo Methot, with whom he engaged in much-publicised alcoholic battles. She was persuaded to divorce him, and the lovers were married on May 21, 1945. 'When I married Bogie', she remarked in a 1994 interview, 'I agreed to put my career second, because he wouldn't marry me otherwise. He'd had three failed marriages to actresses, and he was not about to have another.' She had son Stephen in 1949 and daughter Leslie in 1952. She also became active politically, joining her husband in protesting the Hollywood blacklist of suspected Communists and campaigning for Democrats. Few could forget the picture of her slouched on top of a piano, long legs dangling, while Harry Truman — then vice president — was seated in front of the keys. But the party began to wind down in March 1956, when Bogart was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. On the night of Jan. 14, 1957, Bogart grabbed his wife's arm and muttered, 'Goodbye, kid.' He died in the early morning at the age of 57.","Lauren Bacall died from a massive stroke aged 89 at her home in New York on Tuesday .

"Sentencing a criminal to 1,000 years in an artificial hell may one day become a reality. At least, that is the claim of scientists at Oxford University who have been exploring controversial technologies that could extend human life. They say billions are being invested in techniques that could mean the cruellest criminals will be kept alive indefinitely in condition befitting their crime. Last year, a team of scientists led by Rebecca Roache began exploring technologies that could keep prisoners in an artificial hell . According to their research, prison firms could also develop drugs that make time pass slowly, making an inmate’s sentence feel like an eternity. Last year, a team of scientists led by Rebecca Roache began exploring technologies that could keep prisoners in an artificial hell. ‘Some crimes are so bad they require a really long period of punishment, and a lot of people seem to get out of that punishment by dying,’ Dr Roache told Ross Andersen in Aeon magazine. Dr Roache highlights what she describes as the ‘laughably inadequate’ sentence of 30 years in prison for Magdelena Luczak and Mariusz Krezolek. Daniel died in March 2012 from a head injury, locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress. Dr Roache highlights the 'laughably inadequate' sentence of 30 years in prison for Magdelena Luczak and Mariusz Krezolek . Daniel's mother Magdalena Luczak . (right) and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek (left) were found . guilty of  murder . Life extension technologies could mean the cruellest criminals will be kept alive indefinitely in condition befitting their crime. As well as extending life, there are a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people’s sense of time. Dr Roache said that might not be far off developing a pill that could make someone feel like they were serving a 1,000-year sentence. Another scenario explored by the group is uploading the criminal's mind to a digital realm to speed up the 1,000 year sentence. This means that with sufficient computer power, it would be possible to speed up the rate at which an uploaded mind runs. Similarly, uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours. The pair were convicted of murdering Luczak's four year-old son, Daniel, who was beaten, starved and tortured before his death. On her Practical Ethics blog, Dr Roache notes that Luczak and Krezolek will receive the humane treatment that Daniel never did. ‘They will, for example, be fed and watered, housed in clean cells, allowed access to a toilet and washing facilities, allowed out of their cells for exercise and recreation,’ she writes. Turning to human engineering as a possible solutions, Dr Roache looks at the idea of life span enhancements so that a life sentence in prison could last hundreds of years. ‘Dr Aubrey de Grey, co-founder of the anti-ageing Sens research foundation, believes that the first person to live to 1,000 years has already been born,’ she said. ‘The benefits of such radical lifespan enhancement are obvious - but it could also be harnessed to increase the severity of punishments’ As well as extending life, Dr Roache noted that there are a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people’s sense of time. She said that society might not be far off developing a pill that could make someone feel like they were serving a 1,000-year sentence. Turning to human engineering as a possible solutions, Dr Roache looks at the idea of  life span enhancements so that a life sentence in prison can last hundreds of years. The technology could be used on the most serious crimes, such as those committed by Adolf Hitler . ‘Of course, there is a widely held view that any amount of tinkering with a person’s brain is unacceptably invasive,’ she said. ‘But you might not need to interfere with the brain directly.’ Time distortion, for instance, is already a technique used in interrogation, where people are exposed to constant light, or unusual light changes, so that they can’t tell what time of day it is. Another scenario being explored by the group is uploading the criminal's mind to a digital realm to speed up the 1,000 year sentence. ‘As the technology required to scan and map human brain processes improves, some believe it will one day be possible to upload human minds on to computers,’ Dr Roache said. This means that with sufficient computer power, it would be possible to speed up the rate at which an uploaded mind runs. Prison firms could also soon develop drugs that make time pass slowly, making an inmate¿s sentence feel like an eternity . Similarly, uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours. ‘This would, obviously, be much cheaper for the taxpayer than extending criminals’ lifespans to enable them to serve 1,000 years in real time,’ said Dr Roache. If these technologies are developed, one crime that could ever justify eternal imprisonment was something that would endanger mankind. ‘Suppose there was some physics experiment that stood a decent chance of generating a black hole that could destroy the planet and all future generations,’ said Dr Roache. 'If someone deliberately set up an experiment like that, I could see that being the kind of supercrime that would justify an eternal sentence.’","This is the scenario being explored by researchers at Oxford University .

"Oscar Pistorius may have beaten his girlfriend with a cricket bat before shooting her, South African police believe. Detectives are reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the Paralympic champion’s bedroom and to have established that model Reeva Steenkamp’s skull had been ‘crushed’. This and other evidence – a smashed bathroom door, a 9mm pistol, the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led them to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘rock solid’. Scroll down for video . South African police are investigating whether Oscar Pistorius beat his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp unconscious with a cricket bat before shooting her after a bloodied bat was reportedly found at his home . Miss Steenkamp, 29, was shot four times early on Thursday at Pistorius’s luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of Pretoria. Police have rubbished speculation that Pistorius – who is known to have kept a pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder. Prosecutors have formally charged Pistorius with premeditated murder but the Blade Runner’s family say he firmly denies such a charge. Yesterday it emerged that he called his close friend Justin Divaris shortly after the killing – reportedly before the emergency services were alerted – and told him: ‘There has been a terrible accident, I shot Reeva.’ Mr Divaris rushed to the house, where he said Pistorius repeatedly told him: ‘My baba, I’ve killed my baba. God take me away.’ While no officials would comment publicly on the case, a disturbing – though disputed – picture of what may have happened in Pistorius’s home started to emerge. Neighbours have said they heard shouting coming from the house at around 1.30am. There were some suggestions, quickly denied, that the row may have been about Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with a rugby player. At around 3.20am, four shots rang out – apparently not all at once. The first person Pistorius called was his father Henke, 59. Shock: Pistorius appears in court charged with premeditated murder, but says he killed his girlfriend accidentally after mistaking her for an intruder at his home . When he arrived, he allegedly saw his son carrying his nightie-clad girlfriend down the stairs. She had been shot in the head, hip, . arm and hand. Pistorius – and later paramedics – struggled in vain to . save Miss Steenkamp’s life. Police reportedly found the bloodied . cricket bat in the bedroom. The en-suite bathroom door was riddled with . holes, a pistol holster was found by Pistorius’s bed and a gun cartridge . was on the floor. South Africa’s City Press quoted an . unnamed police source as saying: ‘The suspicion is that the first shot, . in the bedroom, hit her in the hip. She then ran and locked herself in . the toilet. ‘She was doubled over because of the . pain. He fired three more shots. She probably covered her head, which is . why the bullet also went through her hand.’ The source said police are carrying out tests to establish whose blood is on the bat. While one scenario is that Pistorius . attacked Miss Steenkamp with the wooden bat, it has also been claimed . that the model may have used it to defend herself. Rugby star Francois Hougaard's agent said the 'sad ordeal' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the Springbok's friendship with Miss Steenkamp . A third possibility is that Pistorius . used it to break down the bathroom door. Those close to Pistorius have . suggested that he may done so in a bid to ‘save’ his dying girlfriend. According to this theory, the athlete . first shot Miss Steenkamp by accident, whereupon she fled to the . bathroom. He then shot at the door lock to try to get in, accidentally . killing her. Pistorius’s father appeared to suggest it is this version that he believes. While he admitted that he had not . talked to his son in detail about what happened, he said he had ‘zero . doubt’ that the sportsman thought Miss Steenkamp was an intruder. A more likely defence from Pistorius is to acknowledge that there was a row but that he did not intend to kill her. Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics . Some in South Africa have speculated . about the nature of Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with Springbok rugby . player Francois Hougaard, and whether this played a part in the tragedy. The 24-year-old was keen to distance . himself from such reports at the weekend. His agent said: ‘This whole . sad ordeal has got nothing to do with him.’ Last night Pistorius’s agent said he had withdrawn him  from all planned races but insisted his sponsors were sticking by him. The tragedy has also cast fresh light on Pistorius’s apparent attraction to danger and weaponry. Miss Steenkamp's father Barry wept as he said he and his wife June were at 'a complete loss' As well as owning a pistol and . machine gun, at the time of Miss Steenkamp’s death he reportedly had . seven outstanding firearm licence applications. One was for same type of assault rifle used in the recent Sandy Hook school massacre in the US. Pistorius, who was charged with . premeditated murder at a court appearance on Friday, spent the weekend . in a police cell ahead of a second hearing planned for tomorrow at which . his lawyers are expected to ask for bail. Police say they will oppose the request.","South African police reportedly found a bloodied cricket bat at his home .

"Microsoft is considering releasing a free version of its Windows 8.1 software in a bid to persuade customers to upgrade to the latest versions. Reports claim a new version, called Windows with Bing, could be given away. The firm is also rumoured to be considering dropping the price or even giving away its Windows Phone software. The controversial 'Metro' interface for Windows, which confused many users. Microsoft is now considering going back to the normal desktop when users first switch on their machine. According to reports at The Verge, 'Microsoft is currently experimenting with a free version of Windows 8.1 that could boost the number of people using the operating system. 'Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the company is building 'Windows 8.1 with Bing,' a version that will bundle key Microsoft apps and services,' the site claims. The firm has already made major changes to Windows 8 in a bid to make it more appealing to consumers. It is also believed to be planning to abandon its controversial 'tile' start screen and reverting to the classic windows desktop every time a user switches on their PC, it has been claimed. The latest test versions of Windows 8.1 released to developers have this option on by default. Microsoft was also last year forced to reinstate the start button to Windows 8 following customer complaints. According to Russian developer known only as Wzor , the latest version now starts in the desktop rather than Microsoft's tile system, called Metro. The Verge claims sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans have revealed to that the upcoming update for Windows 8.1 will enable this by default. Microsoft was last year forced to reinstate the start button to Windows 8 following customer complaints. 'Like many other changes in Update 1, we’re told the reason for the reversal is to improve the OS for keyboard and mouse users,' the site says. The firm hoped the system would make it easier for touchscreen users, and is the same across Microsoft's phones, tablets and PCs. However, many users were confused, and Microsoft recently reinstated the classic start menu on its desktop. ‘Let’s make it easier to start applications in the way we are used to,’ boss Steve Ballmer told its annual Build developer conference, to cheers from the audience. ‘We will bring back the start button, and you can boot straight to the desktop if you want to.’ ‘We have refined the blend of our desktop experience and our modern app experience.’ Ballmer also said the firm was not abandoning its start menu and said it was slowly beginning to attract app developers to Windows 8. ‘Within this month we’ll pass the 100,000 app mark in the Windows store,’ said Ballmer. Flipboard, Facebook and the NFL all revealed new apps. However, the latest rumours suggest Microsoft will allow these apps to run on the desktop.","Free version to be called 'Windows with Bing'

"Two black African cardinals emerged as frontrunners for the papacy yesterday after the shock resignation of Benedict XVI. He became the first leader of the Roman Catholic church to step down in 600 years and the first to abdicate through ill-health. Amid feverish speculation about the succession, two of the favourites were Ghana’s Cardinal Peter Turkson, 64, and Cardinal Francis Arinze from eastern Nigeria. Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson (left), of Ghana, is the bookies' favourite for the job of pope while Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze (right) is seen as an outside contender for the job . Italian-Argentine Leonardo Sandri could be the first non-European leader of the Roman Catholic church . The election of a black pope would . reflect the growing strength of the Catholic church in the developing . world. But it could be controversial in parts of Eastern Europe where . racism remains a problem. Two other contenders, Cardinal Odilo Scherer, Archbishop of San Paolo, . and the French-Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, would also be a break . with the tradition of electing only European popes. A new cardinal has to be chosen after Pope Benedict XVI (pictured) stood down . Many believe the next pope should come from the developing world – . particularly Latin America, where Catholicism is the dominant religion, . or Africa, where the number of followers is growing. Forty-two per cent of the world’s 1.2billion-strong Catholic population – . the largest single block – live in Latin America compared to 25 per . cent in its European heartland. After the long reign of a Polish pope – John Paul II – and a German . pope, the Italian Catholic church will put a lot of pressure on . cardinals to support an Italian for the papacy. Among its favourites are . Cardinal Angelo Scola, Archbishop of Milan, and Cardinal Angelo . Bagnasco, Archbishop of Genoa. Benedict’s resignation shocked churchgoers and left the senior ranks of the church in turmoil. Revealing his decision to a gathering of cardinals on Sunday, he said . his ‘strength of mind and body’ had failed in the last few months. The Vatican denied that any single medical complaint was responsible but . speculation centred on 85-year-old Benedict’s arthritis problems. He . needs a moving platform to take him to the altar in St Peter’s, and it . is difficult for him to kneel and pray. Yesterday it emerged that the Pope made his decision to quit last April following a tour of Mexico and Cuba. The resignation, to take effect on the last day of this month, means a . conclave of senior cardinals will meet in Rome to choose a successor by . the end of March. He sprung his surprise at a meeting to canonise three new saints. Some cardinals didn’t understand what Benedict had told them and others . looked stunned. ‘All the cardinals remained shocked and were looking at . each other,’ said Monsignor Oscar Sanchez, who was in the room at the . time. Argentinian Jorge Mario Bergoglio (left), 77, and Honduran Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodrigues Maradiaga (right), 70, have both been tipped as potential future popes . Italians Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone (right), 78, and Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco (right), 70, are potential candidates for the position which, until John Paul II, was always held by a man from Italy . After the news was announced to the wider world Benedict said in a . statement: ‘I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an . advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the . Petrine ministry (the papacy). Odilo Scherer, 63, Archbishop of Sao Paolo, is one of the younger contenders for the job . ‘In today’s world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by . questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern . the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind . and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has . deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognise my . incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.’ A Vatican spokesman admitted: ‘It has taken us by surprise a bit.’ The . Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said it was ‘a . bolt from the blue’. Among those with knowledge of the state of the Pope’s health is his . brother, Georg, 89. He said yesterday: ‘His age is weighing on him. My . brother wants more rest.’ The Pope had demanding tours ahead of him, including a visit to Brazil in July for the church’s World Youth Day. Yesterday he said he intends to live ‘a life dedicated to prayer’. The Vatican said his immediate future will be spent at Castel Gandolfo, . the Papal villa south of Rome, and that after his resignation he will . retreat to a monastery. Tom Montgomery, a second year seminarian from the diocese of Westminster . studying at the Vatican said: ‘We were absolutely gobsmacked. Everyone . is shocked. ‘But Benedict has been a Pope of surprises. He’s changed from being the . Cardinal Rottweiler to being a German Shepherd. People said he hadn’t . the charisma of John Paul. But he is a great teacher. People came to see . John Paul but they come to hear Ratzinger.’ David Cameron said: ‘His visit to Britain in 2010 is remembered with . great respect and affection. He will be missed as a spiritual leader to . millions.’ The last pope to resign was Gregory XII in 1415, who quit reluctantly to end the so-called Great Schism, a period from 1378 when there were two popes – one in Rome and one in Avignon. Although the right of a pope to resign has been repeatedly enshrined in the laws of the Roman Catholic Church, the fact that none has in 600 years suggests it is only likely in the most testing circumstances. Popes are expected to serve for life, with Benedict’s predecessor John Paul II carrying on for years during chronic ill-health until his death in 2005. The first pope to resign was St Pontian, who quit after being sent to the Sardinian salt mines in 230AD by Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax during his persecution of Christians. Knowing he would not survive the ordeal, Pontian stood down to make way for a successor in 235AD. Benedict IX was Pope on three separate occasions in the 11th century, thanks to family influence, bribery and manipulation. He resigned for the last time in 1045, on a promise from his rivals of a woman to marry and gold worth the modern equivalent of £25million. However, the money was never paid.

"A publicity stunt that involved releasing thousands of butterflies at a Chinese science exhibition to raise awareness of conservation backfired badly - after thousands of the insects were killed. The incident took place in Xingxiang in central China's Henan Province during the Butterfly Popular Science Exhibition, organised by a museum in the city. During the event more than 10,000 rare butterfly specimens of various species from around the world were on display. Poorly thought-out: Thousands of butterflies were killed during a conservation event in Xinxiang, China. The insects were released but many injured by crowds eager to hold them . Ironic: The aim of the butterfly release was to highlight conservation efforts . Shredded: This picture shows the badly-damaged remains of the butterflies . The organisers also released thousands of butterflies to promote the idea of environmental awareness. But, instead of protecting them, visitors started to fight to capture the flying butterflies, causing many of the creatures to be crushed or injured. Amazingly, something similar happened during an event to showcase the natural beauty of land earmarked for a new property development earlier this month. A company bought land on the outskirts of the city of Wuhan in  China's Hubei Province and hoped to attract potential buyers by highlighting the area's natural environment, far away from the smog of the city. The region of rolling hills and woodland is named Butterfly Valley, and so the developers decided that a Butterfly Festival would be the perfect way to showcase the region. Visitors started to fight to capture the flying butterflies, causing many of the creatures to be crushed or injured . The incident took place in Xingxiang in central China's Henan Province during the Butterfly Popular Science Exhibition, organised by a museum in the city . Beauty expired: A woman holds a pair of the fragile insects up to the camera . Children grabbed the brightly-coloured butterflies. They event featured a vast array of different species . A butterfly lands on the arm of a toddler attending the science exhibition . The only problem was most butterflies hatched in the area in early spring and the last ones had already died around June. So instead they contacted specialist breeders and arranged for thousands of butterflies from more than 800 different species to be shipped in. Some were released by members of the public, while others were kept in special netted tents for the amusement of visitors. However, not only did many of the butterflies get injured in transit and die shortly after they were released, but others succumbed to the unseasonal weather and expired after a few days. So instead of the sight of butterflies fluttering over the valley or being snapped by happy visitors, Chinese social media was flooded with images of dead and dying exotic butterflies falling from the sky or being trampled underfoot. It sparked a wave of protest from China's small but increasingly vocal animal rights activists who said the whole idea was 'cruel and pointless'. The PR agency that organised the stunt said they had asked visitors not to touch or play with the butterflies, and that the only reason they were dying was because they had a short lifespan.","The insects were released at a science show in the city of Xingxiang .

"A former Microsoft manager who had never even smoked marijuana 18-months ago is planning to turn his budding pot business into the Coca Cola brand of cannabis. Jamen Shively, a former Microsoft corporate strategy manager said that he envisions his Seattle-based enterprise becoming the market leader in recreational and medical cannabis, just like McDonald's dominates fast food and Starbucks, coffee. His brand, Diego Pellicer, is named after Shively's great-grandfather, a former U.S. diplomat and the 'dot bong' entrepreneuer is rapidly acquiring medical-marijuana dispensaries across Washington state and Colorado - which he hopes is the start of pots first established international brand. High Flyer: Marijuana entrepreneur and CEO of Diego Pellicer Inc. Jamen Shively announces plans to create the first U.S. national marijuana brand in Seattle, Washington, May 30, 2013 . Shively, 45, whose six years at Microsoft ended in 2009, said he was soliciting investors for $10 million in start-up money and he has already roped in former Mexican President Vicente Fox - hoping to open a 'legal' pot trade between the U.S. and Mexico. 'Let’s go big or go home,' said Shively to the Seattle Times. 'We’re going to mint more millionaires than Microsoft with this business.' 'I’ve just fallen in love with the plant,' Shively told the Times. 'Especially in the medical realm I’ve gone from entrepreneur to advocate to activist, seriously.' Fox appeared at a news conference on Thursday in Seattle, along with Fox, where he recounted how the war on drugs has ravaged his country and praised the states of Washington and Colorado for voting to legalize the recreational use of marijuana last fall.

'It's a giant market in search of a brand,' Shively said of the marijuana industry. 'We would be happy if we get 40 percent of it worldwide.' A 2005 United Nations report estimated the global marijuana trade to be valued at $142 billion. Washington state and Colorado became the first two U.S. states to legalize recreational marijuana when voters approved legalization in November. Shively laid out his plans, along with his vision for a future in which marijuana will be imported from Mexico, at a Thursday news conference in downtown Seattle. Joining him was former Mexican President Vicente Fox, a longtime Shively acquaintance who has been an advocate of decriminalizing marijuana. Fox said he was there to show his support for Shively's company but has no financial stake in it. 'What a difference it makes to have Jamen here sitting at my side instead of Chapo Guzman,' said Fox, referring to the fact he would rather see Shively selling marijuana legally than the Mexican drug kingpin selling it illegally. 'This is the story that has begun to be written here.' The Face of Cannabis in the 21st Century? Named after Shively¿s great-grandfather and former vice governor of the Island of Cebu in the Philippines, Diego Pellicer, Inc. is poised to become the first name brand marijuana sold in the U.S. Cashing In on Legal Changes: A customer smokes marijuana inside of Frankie Sports Bar and Grill in Olympia, Washington on December 9th, 2012 .

Stoned: A man lights his pipe at the 4/20 pro-marijuana rally in Civic Center Park in downtown Denver April 20, 2013. Thousands of marijuana enthusiasts gathered for an annual weekend celebration of legal cannabis in Colorado . Shively told Reuters he hoped Fox would serve an advisory role in his enterprise, dubbed Diego Pellicer after Shively's hemp-producing great grandfather. The sale of cannabis or marijuana remains illegal in much of the world although countries mainly in Europe and the Americas have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of it. A larger number of countries have decriminalized or legalized cannabis for medical use. Shively acknowledges that his business plans conflict with U.S. federal law and are complicated by regulations in both Washington state and Colorado. He said he is interested in buying dispensaries that comply with local and state rules and are less likely to attract the scrutiny of authorities. 'If they want to come talk to me, I'll be delighted to meet with them,' he said of federal officials. 'I'll tell them everything that we're doing and show them all our books.' Furthermore, he paraphrased stoner legend and Star Wars character Obi-Wan Kenobi to sum up his attitude towards the authorities.

"Anti-mosquito apps (example pictured) emit ultrasonic frequencies designed to mimic predators and frighten mosquitoes . The muggy weather is creating a ‘perfect storm’ for mosquitoes to descend on our gardens. But the latest high-tech weapon in the battle against the bloodsuckers doesn’t come in the form or a spray or clip, instead it’s a free app on your smartphone. Anti-mosquito apps emit ultrasonic frequencies designed to frighten the mosquitoes away. They do this by either mimicking the sounds of mosquito predators, such as dragonflies and bats, or by using the sound made by the wings of male insects. Once a female mosquito has mated, she is said to actively avoid contact with males, so by playing this sound, the females stay away. The most popular app is called the Anti Mosquito Sonic Repeller. Its developers claim that the pitch of the sound it produces is so high, most humans don’t notice it. It also comes with various frequencies in order to target different mosquito species within specific locations. Although, the app does not guarantee 100 per cent protection, because ‘there are more than 3,500 known mosquito species in the world and they all react slightly different to the repellent’. Other apps that play ‘mosquito sounds’ are designed to annoy people, rather than repel mosquitoes but have been found to serve that purpose by accident. The official name for such apps, and other similar technologies, is electronic mosquito repellents, or EMRs. Experts have expressed concern about using these apps as a standalone repellent, however. Research from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine found ‘no evidence of an effect of EMRs on landing rates.

"Females may be the fairer sex, but it seems that men like looking at themselves more, taking almost double the number of selfies that women do. This trend has arisen because men see showing off using a smartphone as 'acceptable vanity', according to a psychologist. The general obsession with selfies, however, is affecting Brits' life experiences. Vanity: Men taking double the number of selfies than women, according to a Samsung survey . Selfie was recently named the word of 2013, beating tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming. Editors . from Oxford Dictionaries, which made it their Word of 2013, said the . word has evolved from a niche social media tag into a mainstream term . for a self-portrait photograph. One . of the most famous selfies this year was the Pope posing with teenagers . at the Vatican. The picture went viral on social media and was widely . speculated as being the first ever 'Papal selfie'. A third admit they’ve missed a great . live moment because they were taking a snap of themselves, according to a . survey of 2,000 people. Experiences . are also being missed out on by Brits’ eagerness to upload selfies to . social media sites – so everyone else can see their good looks. Over half (52 per cent) of the respondents for the study, commissioned by Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom, admitted that they uploaded photos from their smartphones immediately to their social media profiles. Some selfies are known as ‘braggies’ – and are designed purely to show off or make friends jealous, according to a Hotels.com study published recently. The poll found that 5.4 million people in the UK post these bragging photos within 10 minutes of arriving on holiday, for example, as well as of hotel rooms, in bars and nightclubs and even of their bed. Men’s selfie-obsession stems from the fact that it’s an acceptable form of vanity, according to behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings. She told MailOnline: ‘Selfies are modern day vanity. Men have come to the vanity game later than women. They’re taking selfies because there’s a technological aspect to them, so they see it as a more acceptable way of revealing their vanity.’ Perhaps it make him feel manly? Justin Bieber (pictured) is a well-known selfie taker . The men who have a handle on technology should perhaps remind smartphone users that their devices can also make calls, as well as take photographs. While around 35million selfies are taken by Brits a month, according to a recent HTC survey, Samsung’s research shows that just 26 per cent of Brits admit to only ever dialling friends and family on their devices. Paul Scott, Head of Product Marketing Digital Imaging, Samsung Electronics UK, said: 'The explosion of social media and the expansion of 4G has meant that more people are sharing photos of their lives with the rest of the world than ever before, and naturally, they are taking to their smartphones to help capture the perfect shot. 'The Galaxy S4 Zoom was designed with this in mind -  thanks to its Wi-Fi connectivity, it’s possible to take great photos and share them instantly with others.'","'Taking a selfie is acceptable vanity for men,' says behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings .

"A flood of aggressive 'demon shrimp' could wipe out native species in Britain as they spread through waterways across the country. The shrimp, which kill and eat indigenous breeds, come from eastern Europe are thought to have been carried here in pools of water aboard large ships. Experts have warned of the 'major threat' which the animals, just 1cm long, present to native ecosystems. Aggressive: The so-called demon shrimp could wipe out stocks of native shrimp in some British waterways . Some scientists have warned that the shrimp could also spread diseases that could ravage other waterlife and change the character of entire ecosystems. An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'Invasive shrimp such as this species present a major threat to the ecology of our rivers and lakes. We have a real battle on our hands to control their spread. 'These demon shrimp have been introduced into lakes in east Europe as fish food but they eat nearly anything. 'It's difficult to say exactly what the long term financial impact would be but, for example, they do eat mayflies and that will impact fly fishing. 'We also classify rivers by ecological status and these shrimp could alter a river's status - meaning we could have to invest money restoring ecosystems.' Dr Alex Ford, a marine scientist from the University of Portsmouth, is investigating alongside the agency, and warned of the potential for 'demon parasites' clinging to the shrimps' bodies to damage British ecosystems. Predatory: The shrimp kill and eat their native equivalents, and could also carry fatal parasites . Dr Ford, from the university's Institute of Marine Sciences, said: 'They are out-eating and out-competing our native shrimp and changing the species dynamic in our rivers and lakes. 'As soon as one species is depleted, it can affect the whole food chain with potentially catastrophic results. 'One of the main reasons why invasive species are successful is the escape from predators, parasites and disease in their native habitats. 'We are looking at whether these demon shrimp carry 'demon parasites', which could also affect our native species that won't have any immunity. 'There is a very real bio-security threat of spreading disease and parasites in native populations without acquired resistance.' Demon shrimp can be found living underneath stones in rivers and have been replacing and mating with other amphipods. It's not the first time a new species has taken over British waters. American Signal Crayfish were introduced in the 1970s and have since eaten their way through British waterways - feasting on plants, invertebrates and small fish. The six-inch long crayfish, which live for up to 12 years, carry a fungus which kills native crayfish, a protected species. As a result, the Environment Agency has ruled that all non-native crayfish caught in British waters are to be destroyed.","The species, from eastern Europe, are known to kill and eat native shrimp .

"A slick English-language magazine released by Al-Qaeda's media wing has called on wannabe jihadists to target British  department stores in bomb attacks. The chilling online publication, entitled 'Palestine: Betrayal of the Guilty Conscience Al-Malahem' instructs militants on how to build homemade bombs, and suggests a number of high-profile targets. Among those listed in the UK are military academy Sandhurst, the MI5 headquarters and well-known department stores - which Al-Qaeda orders should only be attacked on Friday afternoons when Muslims are praying at their mosque. The well-produced digital magazine includes a nine-page spread on how to 'make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom,' as well as features on car bombs and a celebratory timeline of terror attacks in the West, which concludes with the entry '201?' - implying new terror attacks are planned. Terrorist's handbook: 'Palestine: Betrayal of the guilty conscience' is an English-language online publication that encourage extremists living in Western countries to carry out acts of terrorism . The magazine was created by the media arm of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP and focuses on preparing wannabe terrorists for 'lone wolf' attacks - believed to be al-Qaeda's new preferred method in an age where Western intelligence makes life difficult for organised terror cells. Once militants have followed the instructions and prepared their homemade bombs, the magazine suggests a list of targets on which to try them out - including shops, Sandhurst and Thames House in the UK, Times Square, mega-casinos, oil tankers and the Georgia Military College in the U.S., and any international holiday resort known to be frequented by American or Israeli tourists . Included in the list of celebrated 'jihadists events' is the date '201?', which suggests al-Qaeda plans to carry out another major terrorist attack at some point in the next five years. The guide to making a car bomb comes complete with step-by-step photographs, a shopping list, and admiring words about the Tsarnaev brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings. 'My Muslim brother: we are conveying to you our military training right into your kitchen to relieve you of the difficulty of traveling to us,' it reads. Terrorism timeline: The blank entry at the end of this timeline implies another attack is expected . Haunting: The disturbing publication ends with the words, 'We are coming' 'If you are sincere in your intentions to serve the religion of Allāh, then all what you have to do is enter your kitchen and make an explosive device that would damage the enemy if you put your trust in Allah and then use this explosive device properly.' At the end is a list of 'examples of targets,' including oil tankers and trains, casinos in Las Vegas, and the General Atomics headquarters in San Diego. The publication is an adjunct to Inspire magazine - which is aimed at encouraging Muslims in Western countries to carry out terror attacks. 'Inspire Magazine's goal is to empower Muslim. And what is empowerment without being strong, powerful and intelligent? In this section, we give you strength, power and intelligence. Believe me, using car bombs gives you all that,' the publications reads. Chilling: The online publication instructs militants on how to build homemade bombs, and suggests a number of high-profile targets, including New York's Times Square (pictured)","Publication by Al Qaeda's media arm encourages new wave of terror attacks .

"In the week that Nasa is celebrating the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing, one Japanese artist has taken on a pioneering space endeavour of his own by sending plant life to the edge of space. Azuma Makato, a 38-year-old from Tokyo, sent a bonsai tree and a flower arrangement into the upper atmosphere to witness what would happen. The results are a stunning cascade of colour and beauty as the plant life soars towards the cosmos, before the inevitable pop of the helium balloons that took them there brings them crashing back to Earth. Scroll down for video . Azuma Makato, a 38-year-old Japanese artist from Tokyo, sent a bonsai tree and a flower arrangement into the upper atmosphere to witness what would happen . World View Enterprises is offering balloon flights to the ‘edge of space’ for £45,000 ($75,000). Beginning in 2016, the Arizona-based company will take paying customers in a pressurised capsule to a height of 19 miles (30 kilometres). In 2016 the parafoil, together with a high-altitude balloon, will be used to take pressurised capsules known as ‘Voyagers’ on trips to the edge of space. This will give six passengers two hours of 'cruising' during which they will be free to stroll around the ‘luxury’ capsule - which even has a bar and internet access. Makoto launched the two botanical objects from the Black Rock Desert in Nevada on 15 July 2014, reports the New York Times. ‘Flowers aren’t just beautiful to show on tables,’ he said. ‘I wanted to see the movement and beauty of plants and flowers suspended in space.’ With the help of his 10-person crew and Sacramento’s JP Aerospace, Makoto set about designing the structures and setting up the cameras that would make the mission called Exobiotanica a success. Two separate balloons were used to take the bouquet and bonsai tree into the upper atmosphere. The first, carrying the bonsai, rose to a height of 91,800ft (28,000 metres) in 100 minutes before the helium balloon burst. Makoto launched the two botanical objects, including a flower arrangement (shown), from the Black Rock Desert in Nevada on 15 July 2014 . With the help of his 10-person crew and Sacramento's JP Aerospace, Makoto designed structures (shown) and set up cameras to make the mission a success . The bouquet was composed of 30 types of flower including peace lilies, dahlias and orchids and reached a height of about 87,000 feet (26,500 metres) It then fell to Earth for 40 minutes before parachutes opened and brought it to the ground. The second balloon, carrying the bouquet, made it to about 87,000ft (26,500 metres) in a similar time. The cameras used to capture the incredible shots from high altitude were six GoPro video cameras, donated by Fujifilm. The bouquet was composed of 30 types of flower including peace lilies, dahlias and orchids. The two separate structures were sent to the edge of space using two helium balloons (shown) 'Flowers aren't just beautiful to show on tables,' said Makoto (pictured). 'I wanted to see the movement and beauty of plants and flowers suspended in space' Makoto explained that the bright colours were intended to contrast against the blackness of space. A six-rod axis was used to hold all of the different flowers in place while they ascended into the atmosphere. The bonsai used, meanwhile, was a 50-year-old pine that was flown to Nevada from Tokyo. This was then suspended in a light metal frame. Despite having a tracker on each structure that launched into space, neither was found after the launch to the edge of space.

"A married mother was subjected to repeated body scanning at an airport after being told by one employee that she had a 'cute' figure. Ellen Terrell was travelling with her husband Charlie when she was stopped by airport security and told she had been 'randomly selected' for screening by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Mrs Terrell, from Dallas, Texas, believes that she was exploited and felt 'totally exposed' for the benefit of male employees viewing the scanned images, which give a detail image of the naked body, in a back room. Violated: Ellen Terrell (right) who has two sons, was travelling with her husband Charlie (left) from Dallas Airport when she was asked to go through the TSA body scanner three times by airport staff . She told CBS 11 that she was asked by a female employee: 'Do you play tennis?' When she said that she didn't and asked why, the airport worker responded: 'You just have such a cute figure.' Mrs Terrell, who is an IT executive, was then asked to stand in the full body scanner for a second time at Dallas International Airport. Remarks: Mrs Terrell was told she had a 'cute' figure by a TSA employee before being repeatedly scanned . After . being made to stand in the machine, which uses radiaton, for a third . time, Mrs Terrell heard the female employee say into her microphone: . 'Guys, it is not blurry, I'm letting her go.' The Terrells believe that she was subjected to sexual harassment - and they . are not alone in their worries. The passenger screening program at airports has had frequent complaints that not all passengers are screened in the same way. In reaction to this, the TSA has replaced the machines which give a detailed outline of individuals' figures for a more generic shape. More than 600 Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) units have now been installed at 140 airports across the U.S. On the updated machine, the passenger and the TSA worked both view the image together which lights up on screen if it detects a problem. The need for a separate TSA officer viewing the image in another room is no longer required. A spokeswoman for TSA told MailOnline: 'The new images are very generic and really focus on the privacy of the passenger. They see the same image as the staff.' The images of passengers are not . stored or print and cannot be transmitted. They are deleted from the . system once they have been viewed. Those who fly are not required by law . to pass through AIT screening - but if they opt out, they will receive . alternative screening, including a physical pat-down. MailOnline . was awaiting a response from the TSA as to how many complaints the agency had received . from passengers about the older machine invading their privacy. Mrs Terrell did not file a complaint because she didn't realise that she could, according to CBS. In November, European countries said it would not install the scanners until their risks had been properly assessed. The controversial scanners emit low radiation doses but research has suggested . up to 100 U.S. airline passengers a year could get cancer from them. Under the microscope: Ellen Terrell, pictured with her husband Charlie, said she felt 'totally exposed' during her full body scan at Dallas airport .

The agency also said that more than 300 dangerous or illegal items have been found on . air passengers since 2010, reported Forbes. The first X-ray body scanner was . developed in 1992 by Steven W. Smith. He sold the technology and rights . to Rapiscan Systems, who now manufacture and distribute the device. Fears about the health risks were . raised in the U.S. as far back as 1998 when the machine known as the . Secure 1000 was evaluated by a panel of radiation safety experts brought . together by the Food and Drug Administration. Wife and mother: Mrs Terrell said that she felt male employees in a back room were looking at the scanned image which gave a detailed look of her body . Harassed: Mrs Terrell from Dallas said that a female employee told her she had a cute figure before she was repeated screened . In November 2010 a female passenger claimed she was made to feel 'like a terrorist' for bringing breast milk she had pumped earlier through security at Phoenix airport. Stacey Armato had 12 ounces of breast milk with her and as per TSA guidelines, she requested the milk not be passed through the X-ray scanner because of possible radiation. Last October, a TSA agent faced dismissal after finding a sex toy in woman's bag and leaving her a note saying: 'Get your freak on girl'. They all expressed concerns about the . machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should . not be X-rayed unless there is a medical purpose. The machine’s inventor told panelists that machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come. Now there are 600 units in 140 airports across the U.S. The TSA was introduced in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to increase security on transport in America. The agency has been criticised for . its heavy-handed tactics. On January 11, an airline passenger was . stunned three times with a Taser gun after he refused to complete an . airport screening check and ran into a secure area. Edwin .

"A Utah dad fed up with his daughter’s preference for very short shorts decided to teach her a lesson by donning some Daisy Dukes of his own. Scott Mackintosh was about to go on a family night out, but when he asked his daughter to kindly change into longer shorts and she refused, he took some scissors to an old pair of his own jeans. The result was a revealing pair of cut-offs designed to show his daughter her shorts aren’t ‘as cute as she thinks.’ Scroll down for video... 'In our family we have modesty guidelines': Scott Mackintosh's daughter wouldn't change out of her short shorts before a family outing, so the Utah dad slipped into a pair of his own . ‘In our family we have pretty definite modesty guidelines,’ writes Mackintosh on his wife Becky’s blog. One of those guidelines happens to be no short-shorts. ‘I’m a firm believer that the way we dress sends messages about us, and it influences the way we and others act,’ he writes. Every  Monday, the Mackintoshes do something together ‘in an effort to try to spend time with just the family.’ Last Monday, they decided to go out to eat. Are these the shorts? Scott Mackintosh's daughter Myley, AKA the girl who wouldn't change her shorts, sports an edgy haircut . Myley's dad is unhappy with her choice in shorts so he decided to subtly mock her with his own version of the Daisy Dukes . But as they were about to leave, Mackintosh’s teen daughter was resolute—she would not change out of her Daisy Dukes. At first, the kids had their heads buried in their phones, Mackintosh said, and didn’t notice his revealing attire. ‘Why are you dressed like that?’ his daughter eventually asked when they were nearly at the restaurant. ‘Oh well, I don’t care.’ Dinner came and went without Mackintosh’s daughter breaking a sweat, so he decided to take things to the next level. family first: Scott Mackintosh and his wife Becky are pictured here. Becky published her husbands story of parental retribution on her personal blog . ‘OK, let’s go miniature golfing,’ he said. Again, the daughter wouldn’t let her embarrassment show. Then, when they arrived at a local ice cream shop, she cracked. ‘As I pulled into a stall, my daughter said, “Uh, no! We are not going in!” I said “Let's go through the drive up.”’ Mackintosh, his wife, and their son went inside, but their daughter stayed in the car. He’s not sure if the lesson sunk in, but Mackintosh said he’s comfortable with that. ‘There was no “Dad I get it,”’ he said. ‘But no matter if social media gets the story mixed up and twisted, my daughter will always know that her dad loves her and cares about her enough to make a fool out of himself.’",Scott Mackintosh of Utah saw a teaching opportunity in some scissors and a pair of old jeans .
