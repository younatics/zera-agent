"By . James Rush . They look as if they are the work of an artist, or at least the set for a film based on some far-away planet. But these incredible pictures in fact show the Danxia, or 'rosy cloud', mountains near the city of Zhangye, in the Gansu province of China, captured in all their splendour in the evening light. The mountains have been formed from reddish sandstone which over millions of years has eroded to create this alien-looking landscape. Amazing landscape: These incredible mountains have been formed over millions of years as reddish sandstone has eroded . Popular: The area is increasingly becoming popular with tourists who enjoy walking through the colourful landscape . Out of this world: The Danxia mountains in China almost look as if they are part of some alien landscape . The colours of the mountains range from dark reds to pale blue and lively greens. Unsurprisingly, tourists regularly visit the area to enjoy walks and boat rides through the brightly coloured scenery. The landform is a unique type of petrographic geomorphology which is found only in China and consists of red-colored sandstones and conglomerates of largely Cretaceous age. The landforms were included in the World Heritage List following the World Heritage Committee's 34th meeting, held in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, on August 1, 2010. The heritage site however actually covers a range of landscapes in Southern China, of which Mount Daxia in Guangdong is the most famous. The other five are: Mount Langshan and Mount Wanfoshan, Hunan Province; Taining and Guanzhoushan, Fujian Province; Mount Longhu and Guifeng, Jiangxi Province; Mount Chishui, Guizhou Province; and Fangyan and Mount Jianglang, Zhejiang Province.

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greg For Mailonline . Authorities say an Arizona school math teacher showed up to class drunk and continued drinking throughout the day. Pinal County Sheriff's officials say students at Poston Butte High School in San Tan Valley called the main office Wednesday after 57-year-old Kathleen Jardine began cursing at them. A responding deputy says Jardine eventually admitted that she had drank the night before, that morning and during lunch in her classroom. Drunk mathematics: Kathleen Jardine, 57, was allegedly drunk in class at Poston Butte High School where she cursed at pupils before they reported her behavior to officials . Stash: A staff member found a half-empty bottle of vodka, an empty single-serve wine bottle and a bottle of SunnyD . The deputy says the math teacher had a blood alcohol concentration level of .205. According to AZ Central, she told school officials that she'd been too drunk to drive to work in the morning. Second incident: In 2011, Jardine was dismissed from her position at a New Mexico school for drinking on the job . 'I was afraid I was too intoxicated to drive so I took a cab this morning,' she reportedly said. A . school resource officer found a half-empty bottle of vodka, an empty . single-serve wine bottle and an orange-flavored drink in Jardine's . purse. Jardine, of Chandler, was cited for one count of consumption of alcohol in public but could face disorderly conduct charges. Jardine was fired in 2011 from a school in New Mexico over a similar incident. In that instance, she taught her class while drunk for five hours before students complained that she was behaving strangely and slurring her speech. Florence Unified School District officials declined to comment, citing it as a personnel issue. Jardine was released into the custody of her daughter as officials continue to investigate. 'Learning math can be hard enough, I can’t imagine trying to learn it from a drunk teacher,' said Sheriff Paul Babeu. Florence Unified School District superintendent Dr Amy Fuller released a statement about the incident, praising students who reported the teacher and staff who quickly removed her from the classroom.","Kathleen Jardine, 57, was arrested for teaching math drunk .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . The Bank of England has denied claims by Scottish finance secretary John Swinney that they have had talks on the future currency of Scotland . The Bank of England has denied claims made by a senior Scottish minister that they have discussed arrangements for a currency union if Scotland becomes independent. Threadneedle Street yesterday issued a statement slapping down comments made by Scottish finance secretary John Swinney on Wednesday. In a post on the Scottish National Party’s website, Mr Swinney said: ‘The Scottish government has had technical discussions with the Bank of England regarding out proposal for a currency union and we welcome their continued acknowledgment that the bank will introduce whatever the politicians decide.’ But in a humiliating rebuke, the Bank of England said: ‘To be clear the Bank of England has not entered into discussions with representatives of the Scottish government about proposals for future monetary arrangements in Scotland.’ Insiders said there have only been discussions about how the Bank dispenses its existing powers. This is the second time the Bank has been forced to give a public dressing down to Mr Swinney, who joined the Scottish National Party at the age of 15. In December 2012, the 50 year old told the House of Lord Economic Affairs Committee that the Scottish government has been ‘in very helpful dialogue’ with the Bank over the SNP’s key policy to keep the pound if the Scots vote to leave the UK. The Bank of England issued a statement shortly afterwards saying no such discussions had taken place. The issue of a formal currency union- - in which an independent Scotland continues to use the pound and agrees to the sovereignty of the Bank of England to set interest rates - has become a highly politically charged issue. Chancellor George Osborne and Treasury secretary have both insisted it is ‘wrong’ to suggest there would be a currency union if there is a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum on September 18. But Mr Swinney described this as the ‘scaremongering and threats of UK politicians’ in his statement on Wednesday. Describing a currency union as a done deal, he said: ‘The Scottish Government is clear that an independent Scotland will use the pound and we will do so in a currency union.’ The rift with the Bank of England comes after governor Mark Carney admitted on Wednesday that it is making contingency plans for a ‘yes’ vote. He also offered reassurance that the Bank would stand behind Scottish based banks, at least during the 18 month period between the referendum and ‘independence day’ next March. Speaking at the Inflation Report press conference on Wednesday, the Canadian said: . ‘In terms of financial stability questions – whatever happens in the vote – the Bank of England will continue to be the authority for financial stability for some period – certainly over the interim period.’ The Bank of England is the lender of last resort for UK institutions. Video courtesy of Yes Scotland . A statement by the bank said: 'To be clear the Bank of England has not entered into discussions with representatives of the Scottish government about proposals for future monetary arrangements in Scotland' One concern voiced by firms is that their borrowing costs could go up if they lose the safety net of the Bank of England. Those affected could include Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds if they choose not to move their registered headquarters south of the border. Last night Mr Swinney came under fire from Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor and head of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence. He said: ‘I cannot remember a time when the Bank of England have had to rebuke a politician in such stringent terms. 'Yesterday John Swinney told us the Scottish Government was having discussions with the Bank of England on a currency union. 'Today the Bank of England have said categorically that no such discussions on future monetary arrangements took place.’ He added: ‘In two weeks the ballot papers will start to be issued for postal votes. Imagine what would have happened if people had only found out about this after they had voted. The currency we use is critical for everyone with savings, mortgages, rent to pay and shopping to buy.’ A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The Scottish Government has had ongoing technical discussions with the Bank of England, as the Bank itself has previously confirmed. 'We have always made clear that these are technical discussions and not negotiations, and that we respect the neutrality and independence of the Bank, which had made clear it will implement whatever is agreed.'","John Swinney claimed to have been in talks with bank over currency union .

"By . Steve Doughty . A survey found that a third of people work through their sixties because they can't afford to retire . One in three older people work through their sixties because they can’t afford to retire, a survey has found. The majority keep working past the state pension age – but half do so mainly because they need the money, it concluded. And a million ‘unretired’ older people have gone back to work, mostly because they can’t afford the lifestyle they want. The findings, from insurance company LV, suggest many of the millions who work past retirement age do so out of necessity. The end of compulsory retirement at 65 means large numbers who would once have been forced to retire can keep working. But the loss of ‘gold-plated’ final salary pensions in the private sector, and the inadequate savings of many who rely on a fund to pay for their retirement, mean increasing numbers may have no choice. The survey of 1,116 people by Opinium Research found four out of ten retired at the state pension age. Six out of ten worked on, for an average of three days a week. Around half of those wanted ‘to boost their retirement income’, it found. Richard Rowney, of LV, said: ‘For many people, working for longer is a positive choice. However we cannot ignore that for others, their financial situation means they have to continue working – or even go back to work after retiring – because they simply cannot afford to stop.’ One in six pension-age workers, or around a million people, have ‘unretired’. ‘There is a trend to unretire, with many retirees returning back to work,’ the report said. Half said they needed money, while four out of ten were bored at home. Despite more pensioners working than ever, only one in 20 defer collecting the state pension – although doing so boosts its value by more than 10 per cent a year. The survey found more than a quarter of those who keep working run their own businesses. One in five had launched a business after the age of 60. Among older workers who said they did not need money, the most common reasons for having a job were enjoyment and feeling too young to stop. Three-quarters said they feel much younger than they are, with most saying they feel they are only 50. The majority keep working past the state pension age – but half do so mainly because they need the money .","Millions of older people are working past retirement age out of necessity .

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Cutting travel times, departure tax and opening Australia's regional airports to trans-tasman flights are part of a campaign to attract thousands more Kiwi tourists to fly our shores. Tourism and Transport Forum (TTF) released its Bringing Our Neighbour Closer report today, which outlines proposed reforms including cutting the Passenger Movement Charge from $55 to $25. The report also targets Asian tourists by recommending a common visa to allow them to visit both Australia and New Zealand in one trip. Tourism and Transport Forum has outlined a series of recommended reforms to make it easier for New Zealand and Asian tourists to travel to Australia . TTF Acting Chief Executive Trent Zimmerman said up to 200,000 additional New Zealanders would be visiting Australia by 2020, with a increase to spending of up to $370 million if all the report's recommendations implemented. Tourism Australia data shows there were 1.21 million New Zealand visitor arrivals into Australia in 2013, an increase of 0.9 per cent on 2012. 'New Zealand is our number one international source market, but we could see even more New Zealanders visit Australia by making it quicker, easier and cheaper and by opening up new points of entry,' he said. Options for direct flights from New Zealand to Australia would open to the country's boarders to Kiwi tourists on the proposed trans-tasman flights . Options for direct flights from New Zealand include Canberra, Hobart, Newcastle, Sunshine Coast and Avalon, with routes to more regional airports such as Hamilton Island, Townsville, Mackay, Coffs Harbour and Ballina-Byron. However, regional airports would face logistical and financial barriers to taking international New Zealand flights. The call for reform comes on the back of a period of flat arrival growth, Mr Zimmerman said. 'Holiday visitors actually declined last year,' he said. 'It’s a market we have tended to take for granted and one that needs more attention,' he said of New Zealand. 'Streamlining check-in and customs and quarantine procedures at major airports would make flying from New Zealand to Australia like a domestic service, cutting travel times by around 25 per cent.' He said the reforms aimed to reduce the door-to-door trans-tasman journey to under five hours and the report calls for the recommendations to be adopted next year. 'In 2015, it is time to not only celebrate a centenary of the ANZAC friendship, but also celebrate over 30 years of free trade through a new push to restart the Australasian free travel movement of the 1970s,' the report states. A reduced cost common visa for Asian from countries including China, India, Thailand and the Philippines tourists could attract 187,000 visitors by 2020 and generating hundreds of millions in expenditure. A spokesperson of New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), which covers the tourism sector, said New Zealand will host an Australian and New Zealand Tourism Ministers’ meeting in 2015. 'The Ministers will explore areas where our two countries can work together to build greater innovation and productivity in our tourism sectors,' the spokesperson said. 'New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers announced in February this year that international visitors will only need one visa to attend games in next year's Cricket World Cup.' The event is being co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. The spokesperson said between March 2013 and 2014 more than 1.1 million New Zealanders visited Australia and spending AU$2.3 billion. New Zealand is Australia's number one international tourist source market . In a move to create a a more streamlined arrivals services, SmartGates are already used in eight Australian international airports including Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Gold Coast, Adelaide, Cairns and Darwin, with a total of 61 gates. The two-step process allows passengers aged over 16 from five countries including Australia and New Zealand to skip arrivals queues when entering Australia using ePassports. Passengers first place their passports on a kiosk scanner before being issued a ticket for a SmartGate, where a camera scans the passenger's face and compares it to their passport, which is normally done by customs officials. Once complete the passenger can collect their luggage and as of this year, a further 20 SmartGate terminals were to be installed at Australian international airports. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is working towards automating departures and has been trialling eGates at Brisbane International Airport, a custom spokeswoman said. Sydney Airport confirmed it has 22 SmartGates and 26 kiosks and said they provide including reducing processing times and enhancing boarder security. SmartGates are used in many Australian international airports help people avoid long arrival queues .","Reforms have been proposed to increase New Zealand tourist numbers .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Becoming a victim of sexual abuse is horrific enough, but for many young people, their ordeal is compounded by having to give evidence against their attacker in court. It was recommended to the government 25 years ago that no young witness should . have to give their evidence in a court room unless they wish to. Instead, they may chose to give their evidence via video link. However, according to NSPCC figures, for 99 per cent, giving video evidence still requires them to go to the court building. Even though they won't have to face their attacker in the actual court room, they still fear bumping into them or their supporters in the building. Others are left in despair after enduring brutal and confusing cross-examination by defence lawyers. Traumatic: Young victims of sexual abuse often still have to attend a court building to give their evidence via video link, leading to fears they may bump into their attacker (posed by model) One young person who had to go through this ordeal was teenager Rhiannon (not her real name to protect her true identity), from the Midlands, who had to go to court after being sexually assaulted. She explains: 'I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 by a man who had groomed me. He was arrested in 2013 along with a gang of men who had abused other girls but I had to wait six months for the trial against them to start. 'The wait made me feel scared as I wanted it all to be over and done with. He lived opposite my house before he was arrested and every time I looked at the place it reminded me of what he had done to me. 'I turned 15 while I was waiting for the trial but I couldn't enjoy my birthday as that's all I kept thinking about. 'I was only told the trial date two days before it started so that made me panic even more as I didn't feel like I had long enough to prepare myself.' Rhiannon had to travel to a court in London to give evidence and she said the whole experience was daunting and unpleasant. She said: 'I was given the chance to do a video link but I didn't want the offenders to see my face so I decided to give evidence from behind a curtain instead. I had visited the room before so I knew where I would be standing and I went behind the curtain before everyone else went into the court. 'My video evidence had already been played to the court but the defendant's barrister kept asking me questions that I'd already covered in the video. He kept asking the same questions again and I got confused because he said things like, ""He didn't do that, did he"". 'I have dyslexia so I sometimes get muddled up and I said ""no"" initially. I got confused as to what I needed to answer. This upset me and made me cry. 'He also asked me questions about the defendant touching me and I felt embarrassed to answer so I just nodded. I'd talked about this in my video evidence and having to go over it again made me cry.' The victim said the judge over the proceedings did step in at times which made her feel better and she was allowed to take a break to be comforted by her mother who had accompanied her. Under pressure: Rhiannon said being cross examined by barristers was upsetting (posed by model) Rhiannon said the ordeal could have been made easier if she had been better prepared for what to expect before she attended court. The NSPCC believe the situation could also be improved if the government would allow victims to give evidence via video link without having to be in the court building. The charity are appalled that this is often allowed for criminals - who can give video evidence from prison. Via a freedom of Information request, they discovered that prisoners are 200 times more likely to . have the benefit of using video links during criminal proceedings than a . child witness. Last . year, those accused of committing offences made 50,000 'remote' court . appearances from their prison cells. These included, Ian Watkins, who . conspired to rape babies, Stuart Hazell, the killer of schoolgirl Tia . Sharpe and David Minto, who stabbed a 16-year-old to death. Yet . fewer than 2503 of the 21,000 young victims who gave evidence - . including those who had been sexually or physically abused - had the . same opportunity of using a remote video link to save them the trauma of . going to court. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the . NSPCC, said: 'If remote links are good enough for those accused of crimes . then why on earth are they not available for all child witnesses? This . imbalance in the judicial system is both astonishing and appalling. 'Everyone . seems to agree that the young victims of crime should get every . assistance possible when giving their evidence yet here we have a gaping . hole in the system that needs to be plugged immediately. 'The . courts are rightly using remote video links from prisons to save money . and improve security. But this technology should also be used to help . vulnerable children give evidence. This will reduce the intense . emotional strain they are put under and allow them to give their best . evidence – which is in the interests of justice.' As part of its recently launched 'Order . in Court' campaign, which aims to ease the trauma of child witnesses, . the NSPCC is calling on government to ensure they all have the chance to . give evidence via a video link which is set-up away from a court . building. Last year ChildLine, which is run by the . NSPCC, received 1200 calls from children worried about giving . evidence in court. Balance the system: The NSPCC want more child victims to be allowed to give video link evidence away from court rooms - something that is afforded to many criminals who can give their evidence from prison (posed by model) One girl told their counsellors: 'I'm trying to block . things out at the moment so I've been self-harming. It helps me forget . about how stressed I am. I've got a court case coming up and I have to . give evidence against the person who abused me. The thought of it makes . me want to run and hide.' One . mother described her sons as being 'slayed' by the barrister's cross . examination when they gave evidence against their violent father in court. She said: 'The boys were really worried about coming face to face with their . father in the court building. Even just turning down a corridor and . actually seeing him face to face was more of an anxiety than the . questioning.' After Rhiannon gave her evidence, she had a long wait until her attacker was eventually found guilty and imprisoned for 12 years. Once again, she found she was given little support during this difficult time. She said: 'No-one from the police came to our house to discuss how he was found guilty until a few days later - by then it had been in all of the local newspapers. 'We also had to wait over a month for him to be sentenced as one of the jury was off sick. The wait was hard as I just wanted it to be all over. No-one from court or the police called us to tell us that he had been jailed for 12 years, we only knew as mum went to the court to hear the sentencing.' She added: 'It was nine months from when he was arrested to when he was sentenced. It was a long wait and it made it harder to start my recovery as it was always in the back of my mind. Every time I walked out of the house I was reminded of what happened to me as I could see where he had lived.' Rhiannon was able to gain support from the NSPCC after her social worker referred her to their 'Protect and Respect' programme, which helps girls protect themselves from sexual exploitation. The programme teaches young girls the importance of communicating with their parents. It also covers the techniques abusers use to groom people and how girls can learn to avoid it. Rhiannon said the programme has been a great help. She said: 'I'm not over what happened to me and it will be with me no matter what. 'There are times when I cry my eyes out and I'm depressed but I know I've got to carry on with my life and working with the NSPCC is helping me. 'It gives me someone to talk to and helps me open up to my mum about what happened so that she can help me recover too. 'I'm also learning how to keep myself safe from grooming in the future. Now some days I can have fun and smile and I have things that I am looking forward to. I know my birthday this year will be better than last year.' The NSPCC are urging people to sign an e-petition calling on the UK Government to ensure there is at least one remote site for children to give evidence in each region.","Rhiannon had to give evidence against her attacker .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . Why spend hundreds of dollars on a boring paint job for your car when you can cover it in the actual money instead? These were the bizarre thoughts of an Indiana couple who have given their vintage Cadillac the ultimate bling makeover. When Larry and Theresa Thompson  saw an advert for a 1949 Cadillac Series 62 back in 1999, they decided it couldn't hurt to take a look. They got there to find it covered with layers of snow, and once they had scraped it away, saw that the paintwork was dull, and the colour of an old penny. Rich history: Larry and Theresa Thompson, from Fort Wayne, Indiana, bought a classic Cadillac in 1999, and set about covering every inch of paintwork with more than 38,000 one cent coins . Bling: The car, appropriately named Penny, underwent a real money makeover, and weighs 14 stone more than it did when the couple discovered it covered with snow 15 years ago . This gave them an idea - they would buy the car and cover every inch of it with one cent coins. Six weeks later, 'Penny' was born. The unique 'paint job', consisting of 38,295 individual coins, is worth exactly $382.95 - roughly the same as it would cost to have it spray painted. Mrs Thompson, 48, from Fort Wayne, said: 'Once we had brushed the snow off and discovered she was already the colour of an old penny, we decided it was fate. Teamwork: Friends, family and even strangers pitched in to help with the bizarre project, which took six weeks . Then and now: Penny as she was (left) and how she looks today, covered with coins (right) Larry Thompson painstakingly sticks another coin to the car during the project's early stages . 'We started with our jar of pennies but blew through those pretty quickly. 'Pennies came from friends, family, and even strangers who just wanted to be a part of the project. 'In the 15 years we've owned Penny we've had great fun with her and created some wonderful memories.' Mrs Thompson and her 51-year-old husband 'minted up' the car with the help of their two children. Ben, 25, and Taylor, 22, were ten and seven at the time, and Penny has been with them as they have gone through school and become adults. A 10-year-old Ben Thompson, now 25,  perches on the bonnet and gets to work on the roof . The family still drive the car at weekends and during the summer, and they have also displayed it at shows . Mrs Thompson had to order coins from the U.S. mint, as banks only stock around $12 worth of cents at a time . Every coin was stuck on by hand, and they add a whopping 14 stone to the car's weight, though it still gets driven at weekends and during the summer, and has been displayed at multiple shows. As banks only store around $12 worth of pennies at any given time, Theresa needed to specially order coins from the U.S. mint. Mrs Thompson's one regret is that she never got to show Penny's original owner what her family had done with the car. 'I like to think we helped to fulfil her destiny - I'd love to know how the original owner feels about what we did with her,' she said. 'I tried locating him but discovered he'd passed away shortly before we purchased her. 'Not long ago we crossed paths with one of his grandsons at a car show, who said his grandfather would have loved the car.'","Vintage 1949 Cadillac Series 62 is covered with $382.95 worth of cents .

"The cast of Broadway's Aladdin paid a special tribute to Robin Williams with a singalong to Friend Like Me as theatres dimmed their lights for one minute. Williams was the voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin released in 1992. James Monroe Iglehart, who won a Tony Award for playing the Genie in the theatre version, led the audience at the New Amsterdam Theatre after the curtain went down. The song Friend Like Me is sung by the Genie to Aladdin in the film and musical. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The cast of Broadway's Aladdin paid a special tribute to Robin Williams with a singalong to Friend Like Me . Everyone in the audience was encouraged to sing along and words to the tune had been stuffed into programmes before the show. Inglehart told the audience: 'We've lost not just one of the greatest comedians but one of the greatest entertainers of all time. 'So I want us to sing a little bit of Friend Like Me before we go.' The singalong came as theatres across Great White Way dimmed their lights in solemn tribute to the star. A photo of the actor was also projected on a large screen above the Imperial and Music Box theaters. Tribute: James Monroe Iglehart led the audience at the New Amsterdam Theatre . Inglehart told the audience one of the greatest comedians of all time had been lost . The actor became well known for his screen work but had several hit performances on the stage. Theatergoers . reveled in his performance alongside Steve Martin in Waiting for Godot . in 1988 and more recently in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in 2011. Williams appeared in a one man show, Robin Williams: Live on Broadway, in 2002. Those in stage and screen were equally shocked by his suicide on Monday. Classic: Robin Williams was the voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin released in 1992 . The exact nature of his death has become a controversial point in the tragedy as San Francisco Bay area sheriffs spoke out on Wednesday in defense of their decision to reveal exactly how the actor completed the sad act and what his body looked like thereafter. Marin County Sheriff's Lt. Keith Boyd said in an email that the agency would have liked to withhold some of the information, but could not under the California Public Records Act. 'These kinds of cases, whether they garner national attention or not, are very difficult for everyone involved,' Boyd said. In Memoriam: The lights of Broadway's marquees were dimmed Wednesday night for one minute in honor of comedy legend Robin Williams . 'Frankly, it would have been our personal preference to withhold a lot of what we disclosed to the press yesterday, but the California Public Records Act does not give us that kind of latitude.' Boyd announced during a live, televised . news conference Tuesday that Williams committed suicide by hanging . himself. He described in detail how Williams carried out the suicide and . the condition of the body. Some people criticised the level of detail, . and experts in suicide prevention said the information could influence . those considering suicide to try the same thing. Memorial in Colorado: Tributes have piled up outside the Boulder property made famous in the 'Mork and Mindy' television show that rocketed Robin Williams to stardom . 'Having that amount of detail is not helpful' said Lyn Morris, vice president of clinical operations at Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, which runs the main suicide prevention hotline in Southern California. 'The contagion effect is real, and it's worrisome.' Boyd said the sheriff's office is discussing with the county's attorney possible exemptions to the public record's act that would allow it to withhold the 911 call it received from Williams' home and fire dispatch tapes. But Boyd said the agency would likely have to release them within ten days, as required by law. Free speech groups defended the disclosures as appropriate and said the law enforcement agency was responding to a crush of a requests for information required to be disclosed. 'Coroners are not required to provide details by press conference,' said Terry Francke, head of open government group Californians Aware. But he said the Marin County Sheriff's Department chose to disseminate as much information as quickly possible at one time rather than leak piecemeal. Some three dozen television cameras and twice as many reporters from around the globe crowded the news conference outside the sheriff's offices on Tuesday morning. 'While the impact of the details on some people's mourning of Mr. Williams' passing may have been jarring, keeping what was known under wraps would have added needless speculation if not suspicion to the general shock,' Francke said.","Williams appeared on Broadway in 2002 and 2011 - marquees there were dimmed Wednesday in the late actor's honor .

"By . Associated Press . A woman drank sweet tea containing a toxic cleaning chemical, severely burning her mouth and throat, after a Utah restaurant employee mistook the substance for sugar and mixed it into a dispenser, the woman's attorney said Thursday. Jan Harding, 67, is in critical condition at a Salt Lake City hospital's burn unit, unable to talk and fighting for her life, lawyer Paxton Guymon said. The restaurant manager and investigators have told the woman's family that the worker accidentally put large quantities of a product containing lye into the iced-tea dispenser at Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan, he said. The chemical is common at restaurants and used to degrease deep fryers. Harding and her husband had just arrived at the restaurant after church Sunday when she took a sip of the tea and exclaimed to her husband: 'I think I just drank acid.' Scroll down for video . A 67-year-old woman remains in extremely critical condition after drinking a sweet tea containing lye at at Dickey's Barbecue Pit near Salt Lake City . Jim Harding rushed his wife to a nearby hospital. She was then flown to the University of Utah hospital, where she remained Thursday, Guymon said. Harding's husband and their three adult children were by her side, praying for her recovery. The family declined to comment through Guymon, who spoke on their behalf. 'It's disturbing that this kind of toxic, poisonous material would be in the food prep area and somehow find its way into the iced tea vat,' Guymon said. 'I don't know how something like that can happen.' South Jordan Police are still investigating how the chemical ended up in the jug of sweet tea, but they think it was accidental, South Jordan Police Cpl. Sam Winkler said. Investigators are reviewing video footage from inside the restaurant and interviewing staff who worked that day and in the days leading up to the incident. They have determined Harding is the only victim, Winkler said. It appears she was the first to drink the tea that day, and restaurant employees dumped it out after she was burned, he said. John Thomson, owner of the Dickey's Barbecue franchise in South Jordan, said in a statement Thursday that he's praying for Harding and cooperating with investigators. He refrained from commenting on the specifics out of respect for the Hardings. South Jordan is a suburb of 60,000 about 15 miles south of Salt Lake City. The restaurant has remained open, said Jeff Oaks, Food Protection Bureau Manager at the Salt Lake County Health Department. His office inspected the establishment Monday and found all chemicals properly labeled and separated from food items. The health department is waiting on the results of the criminal investigation to determine if they need to issue any violations. It's unlikely that the restaurant would be fined or shut down, Oaks said.","Victim's throat and mouth began to burn instantly as she sipped from sweet tea laced with highly-toxic cleaning chemical .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Growth has stalled in the eurozone with Germany’s powerhouse economy slamming into reverse and France grinding to a halt. There was zero growth for the 18-country bloc in the three months to the end of June, figures showed. Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, shrank 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year, after registering 0.7 per cent growth in the first three months. Scroll down for video . The German economy shrunk by 0.2 per cent in three months to end of June, which will be bad news for Chancellor Angela Merkel, while 0.8 per cent growth in Britain has buoyed the Tories . France, Europe’s second biggest economy, stagnated for the second consecutive quarter as it registered no growth, according to figures yesterday from Eurostat, the EU’s statistics organisation. Italy, the eurozone’s third largest economy, fell back into recession after shrinking for two consecutive quarters. Last night economists described the worse-than-expected figures as ‘very worrying’ and said they were also bad news for the UK. They fear it will be more difficult for the fragile eurozone economies to withstand any fallout from the growing crisis in the Ukraine, including Russian sanctions, and are concerned the eurozone could slide into a triple-dip recession. A senior Bank of England official described Europe – the UK’s biggest trading partner – as ‘dead in the water’. Monetary policy committee member David Miles told the BBC: ‘Our single biggest export market has been, I’m tempted to say, dead in the water. It hasn’t been growing at all. ‘And it’s difficult in that environment to see [UK] exports growing very strongly. So the recovery, very welcome as it is, has been a bit dependent on consumer spending.’ Eurostat figures showed that the UK grew by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter, second only to Latvia in the EU. But experts said the spluttering performance of economies across the eurozone poses a major problem for the Government as it tries to boost exports to cultivate a more balanced recovery. Growth was flat across the 18 countries of the Eurozone bloc, while the UK economy increased 0.8 per cent . The scale of the challenge was underlined again last week when official figures showed Britain’s trade deficit widened unexpectedly to £9.4billion in June from £9.2billion in May. The shrinking output of the German economy caught experts off guard. The dramatic fall was partly caused by a mild winter, which led its factories to bring forward production, boosting first quarter output. France’s flatlining economy will heap further pressure on its president Francois Hollande, who has been criticised for damaging business by introducing a 75 per cent tax for the wealthy. The French government has admitted it will miss its budget deficit target this year and has cut its forecast for 1 per cent growth in 2014 in half. Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at analysts Capital Economics, said: ‘At what should have been an early stage of recovery in the eurozone, the fact that growth has ground to a halt is very worrying. ‘These are key export destinations for the UK so this has to be very bad news.’ Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial research group Markit, said: ‘A stalling of economic growth in the second quarter raises concerns that the euro area is sliding into a triple-dip recession.’","German economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in second quarter of the year .

A fairground ride owner has appeared in court accused of breaching safety laws after a nine-year-old girl was seriously injured when she was flung 15ft from her seat. Patrick McGeough was operating the twister when Yasmin Vickery came flying off it - colliding with a metal barrier in front of her horrified mother, Kim. Shocking mobile phone footage taken by Kim, 41, shows the moment Yasmin was catapulted into the air. Scroll down for video . Yasmin Vickery, 9, was treated for a suspected broken neck after the horrifying ordeal on November 3, 2012 . Her mother, Kim, captured the incident on her mobile phone camera and believed that her daughter would be paralysed for the rest of her life . Mr McGeough was running the ride at 50mph - 50 per cent faster than its recommended maximum speed, Northampton Magistrates' Court heard. The prosecution have also suggested that he failed to ensure the machine's secondary locks were done up during the incident at Northampton's Hollowell Steam Rally and Heavy Horse Show on November 3, 2012. After being thrown from the ride, Yasmin was treated for a suspected broken neck and was rushed to hospital, accompanied by her mother - who feared her daughter would be paralysed for life. Miraculously, she escaped the terrifying ordeal with severe bruising only and was able to leave hospital a day later. Mr McGeough has been charged with breaching section 33 of the Health and Safety Act 2008 while operating the Edwin Hall twister ride. Yesterday, he gave no indication of what he will plead during the short hearing and was ordered to come back to the court in December.

After the incident, Kim, a company secretary, described the distressing moment she feared her daughter was dead. She said: 'Yamsin had been on the ride with her little cousin Kya and the bar came up, as she went to lean to pull it back she came flying off. 'She spun into the air because it was going so fast, then you could hear this almighty thud. She had gone flying through the barrier. 'I was filming the ride and didn’t notice until the ride stopped what had happened, we were laughing and joking at the time. 'But then I just saw my little girl in a heap over the other side. My six-year-old daughter Talisha who had been watching was in tears, she was petrified - she thought her sister was dead. 'When I ran across and Yasmin said she couldn’t feel her legs - I thought she was paralysed, she could have quite easily have died but she took the brunt of the force on her side rather then her head. 'The impact was sideways, but the paramedics said if she had gone through head first she probably wouldn't be here.

According to new figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, workers in the ACT are getting paid the highest in Australia. Data revealed an average weekly full time wage for a Canberran is $1663, just $20 ahead of workers in Western Australia, while pocketing over $200 than workers in New South Wales. But it has been revealed men in Western Australia do earn more than men in Canberra due to the resources boom. Canberra, ACT has the highest paid weekly wages in Australia. (insert) Parliament House . Canberrans are the highest paid workers in Australia. On average they are paid $1663 a week, $20 more than their Western Australia counterparts. Wages in the ACT have dropped slightly from last year. In November, 2013 the average was $1,671, again trumphing Western Australia (which had a jump of $21 to their wages in 2014 compared to last year). Spokesperson from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) says it's no surprise wages are inflated in the ACT. 'There's a higher proportion in the public sector that are paid more than their counterparts in the private sector.' On average those in the public sector earn $133 more a week than those in the private sector. Western Australia  (Perth CBD left) has ranked second on the highest paid wages in Australia while New South Wales (Sydney Harbour Bridge right) is coming in at third. Not good news for those across the strait,  on average Tasmanians are earning the lowest weekly wage in Australia on $1247. South Australians are next on the lowest paid list, earning about $1359 a week, while Victorians are on about $1380 a week. Five of the eight states are getting paid below the national weekly average at $1454, (which is an increase of nearly 2.5% on the same time last year). Workers in NSW are the closest to earning the national average. The mining industry remains the highest paid sector in Australia. On average miners get paid nearly $2500 week. Canberra, ACT has the highest paid wages in the country at an average of $1663 per week. The mining industry remains the best paid sector of the Australian economy. On average, miners can earn almost $2500 a week.

Not such good news for those in retail and accommodation and food services who are earning the least in the country at just over $1000 a week. Teacher Claire Jacob has lived in Canberra for 19 years and says it's not surprising Canberransare being paid high wages. 'Yes I would imagine public sector workers get paid highly but people with jobs like lawyers, consultants and town planners I would also think would rate highly.' 'The public sector's good wages seem to be driving other high wages across the ACT.' She says she believes the cost of living to be pretty high in Canberra and that might be some of the reason why wages are better.'Registration is more, rates are high and electricity has jumped three percent. I expect the wages will continue to rise with inflation, especially the wages of teachers who are demanding more.' This data could be surprising to some people considering Darwin, Perth and Sydney are recorded to be the most expensive to live, according to Numbeo.

"By . Suzannah Hills . A compulsive hoarder was left trapped for 30 hours after getting stuck under a mountain of his own clutter. Retired engineer Noel Rainer, 85, became wedged between a chaotic mess of bags, boxes and piles of debris after falling over a 2ft-high mound of paper in his kitchen. The pensioner couldn't even reach his nearby phone to call for help because of the clutter, which covers every inch of his home in Halstead, Essex. Hoarder Noel Rainer is pictured left with his daughter Cherry Rainer after becoming trapped under a mountain of his own clutter at his home in Halstead, Essex, pictured right . Stock piling: Hoarding took over the life of former engineer Noel Rainer after his retirement and divorce. This picture shows the kitchen where he fell and became trapped under a mound of rubbish . It was only when Mr Rainer's relatives became concerned that police and firefighters were called in to help rescue him from his home. But he said he had Radio 3 to keep him company as he waited for help to arrive. Mr Rainer is thought to have Diogenes syndrome, also known as senile squalor syndrome, which means he can't stop hoarding rubbish. As he recovered from his ordeal with daughter Cherry, he said: 'I had a pile of papers about 2ft high and I just stepped back and fell over backwards. 'My legs were in the air and I was just in a little cocoon. I was just on my own. I knew I would be OK, but it was a bit lonely. I had Radio 3 on the whole time so I kept up with the news. Accident: Noel Rainer, 85, became trapped in his home after falling over a 2ft-high mound of paper in his kitchen . The house in Halstead, Essex, is now being cleared of the clutter - some of which dates back to the 1960s . 'The phone was in the distance, but it fell off its hook. 'My daughter couldn't lift me out, but once the emergency services arrived it was only about five or ten minutes, then we were sitting outside - they were wonderful.' Daughter Ms Rainer said her 'fiercely independent' father's condition has not been officially diagnosed but they believe he has Diogenes syndrome. Mr Rainer was taken to Colchester General Hospital with minor injuries but is now recovering well. Meanwhile, professional cleaners have started the tricky task of sorting out his clutter and making the house safer to live in. Medical condition: It is believed Mr Rainer suffers from Diogenes syndrome - also known as senile squalor syndrome - which means he can't stop hoarding rubbish . The four-bedroom house and its three-car garage are stacked from floor to ceiling with newspapers dating back to the 1960s, magazines, bulk-buy toilet paper, stockpiled food and washing powder. Ms Rainer, of Hills Road, Sible Hedingham, Braintree, Essex, said: 'It is his own house - he's not renting it - so nobody had been able to do anything about it. He keeps hold of everything that's put through the letterbox. 'He buys everything when they are on offer, so he'll have lots of toilet rolls stored up, then puts them somewhere and can never find them.' Mr Rainer's hoarding has become worse since his retirement and divorce. Ms Rainer said: 'It's so sad and tragic. He had all these projects he had on the go in his garage. He gave up on them 20 years ago, but he never gave up collecting the raw materials - he says yes to everything.'","Engineer Noel Rainer, 85, began hoarding after his retirement and divorce .

"By . J Gardner . The family of the real-life Aunt Jemima is suing the company that made her face synonymous with breakfast for $2billion. D.W. Hunter is the great-grandson of Anna Short Harrington, whose pancake recipe reportedly earned her the honor of becoming the Aunt Jemima mascot in 1935, and says hi family royalties that the company knowingly withheld for over 75 years. He is suing Quaker Oats, its parent company Pepsico and other companies related to the brand on behalf of all Harrington's great grandchildren. A real Aunt Jemima? Aunt Jemima was reportedly based on Anna Short Harrington, but her family says no one has seen a dime since her death in 1955 . The Chicago Tribune reports that Hunter wants punitive damages--to be determined at trial--in addition to the $2billion in royalties not paid to the family after Harrington's death in 1955. The suit alleges that Quaker et al have conspired to withhold information about Harrington's status as a Quaker Oats employee and that they simultaneously exploited her image and recipes for years. The suit alleges the companies claimed to have no record of Harrington's employment or any images of her but that they, however, kept a photograph of her with the U.S. Patent Office. The family says Quaker stole 64 original formulas and 22 menus from Harrington and accuses the company of having a 'racial element' in their exploitation of women since Aunt Jemima debuted in the 1880s. The suit even claims that Quaker used the likeness of Harrington's youngest daughter Olivia Hunter to update Aunt Jemima in 1989. Harrington's great-grandson D. W.

"By . Associated Press . Scientists have started the long job of removing the encrustation from the hull of Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley. When they are finished in about a year, they hope to have the clues as to why the hand-cranked Hunley sank after becoming the first sub in history to sink an enemy warship. For more than three months, the sub has been in a conservation tank in North Charleston soaking in chemicals to help loosen the hard sand, sediment and rust clinging to the sub. Taking shape: Scientists have started removing encrustation from the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley . Quite a task: Conservator Liisa Nasanen gets to work at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston, South Carolina . Time-consuming: After the submarine sat in a chemical bath for more than three months to help loosen the encrustation, scientists began the laborious job of removing the built-up sediment by hand . Conservators on Tuesday started using tools similar to those of a dentist to gently remove the encrustation. The Hunley sank off Charleston in 1864 . after sinking the Union blockade ship Housatonic.

"By . Gemma Mullin . Danielle Stoton, 18, was critically injured in a crash as she walked home from a party on Sunday . A teenage hit-and-run victim was left fighting for her life after being hit on her way home from a party – 12 years after she survived a near-death experience. Danielle Stoton, 18, remains on a life support machine after she was knocked over in Armthorpe, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of Sunday morning. The teenager survived a previous near-death experience when she was six after she hit her head in a swimming pool and almost drowned. Her parents, Michelle and Paul Stoton, stay at her bedside in the neuro-critical unit at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, and hope she will pull through like she did before. Mrs Stoton, 41, said: ‘We were on holiday in Andalucia when she slipped and banged her head, then lost consciousness and slipped underwater. ‘Her lungs filled with water and a man fished her out. She was “dead” and looked blue. I worked on a children’s ward as an auxiliary nurse so I knew.’ Mrs Stoton said her family friend, Lesley Winder, helped save her daughter’s life on the holiday and is at her bedside this time around 12 years later. ‘My friend Lesley gave her CPR and after a couple of minutes she vomited. She was taken to hospital by ambulance and put on a ventilator. ‘In the night she woke up, and that’s when she said she had seen a light. ‘I believe in these things. Perhaps Lesley can work a miracle again and bring her back to us.’ The couple has been told that their daughter has no spinal injury, however, the extent of the trauma to her brain was not yet clear. Mrs Stoton added: ‘Her jaw was broken and the segment broke off and touched her brain. She has a massive cut in her neck and one under her lip. She has lost her top four teeth. ‘They sat her up on Tuesday and she looked better, but she is on life support, has a chest infection and is allergic to penicillin. ‘We were told it would be Thursday at least before she can be roused from her coma.’ Her husband, Mr Stoton, 46, added: ‘We know at least that she is recognising sounds. I feel a lot better at that. My heart isn’t quite as broken.’ After recently losing six stones, Miss Stoton – who was due to have her braces removed this week after four years - had hoped to begin a sports science course next month in a bid to become a personal trainer with the RAF. Miss Stoton survived a previous near-death experience after she drowned on holiday when she was six . Her mother has kept hundreds of well-wishers informed on her daughter’s progress via Facebook, and said they have all been lifted by the heart-warming messages posted to them. Mrs Stoton said her daughter will be ‘eternally grateful’ for the community page ‘Get Well Soon Danielle’. Police have arrested two women, aged 23 and 26, in connection with the incident and both have been bailed pending further enquiries. Her parents Michelle and Paul Stoton hope she will pull through like before and set up a support Facebook page .","Danielle Stoton, 18, remains on a life support machine after the accident .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Elche midfielder Carlos Sanchez is expected to jet into England on Tuesday to complete a £4.7million switch to Aston Villa. The 28-year-old defensive midfielder - who is nicknamed The Rock - is due to arrive in the Midlands to sign a four-year deal. Near: Carlos Sanchez is thought to be flying into the Midlands to complete a move to Villa . Invovled: Sanchez (left) starred for Colombia in their World Cup run to the quarter-finals . The Colombia international has been identified by Villa boss Paul Lambert as the man he wants to add some bite to his midfield. And barring a last minute hitch, the Villa boss looks to have secured Sanchez’s capture ahead of the Barclays Premier League opener against Stoke on Saturday. Sanchez has spent the vast majority of his career playing in France, spending seven years with Valenciennes before moving to Spain in 2013. He has made 30 La Liga appearances for Elche, but he is now poised to leave for England. Villa hope the deal can be completed by Tuesday night or at the latest on Wednesday morning. Progress: Paul Lambert (left) and Roy Keane (centre) are looking to make Villa's fifth signing of the summer . Recruit: Aly Cissokho joined Villa from Valencia last week after spending the season on loan at Liverpool . Sanchez will undergo his medical at Villa's Bodymoor Heath training complex in the coming days, with the club hopeful of completing the deal soon after. No work permit issues are expected given his international experience, which extends to 48 caps for Colombia including all four games at the World Cup in Brazil. But he is not expected to go straight into the squad for Saturday's match at Stoke because he has not yet trained with Lambert's group.

"By . Wills Robinson For Mailonline . 'Most loving boy': Nathan Harrison, four, died during a house fire at his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on Monday . The parents of a four-year-old boy who died in a house fire have said their 'beautiful' son was 'the most loving, happy sweet child'. Nathan Harrison passed away in hospital following the blaze in a bedroom at his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on Monday. His ten-year-old brother Matthew was also taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, but his condition is said to be ‘not life-threatening’. Nathan’s mother Jodie Collins, who is believed to have raised the alarm after the fire broke out, said: 'Our beautiful boy Nathan was the most loving, happy sweet child and he loved everybody. He was the closest person to Matthew, his brother, and now he has sadly gone.' Emergency services were called to the detached property on Monday afternoon after smoke was seen rising from a bedroom window. It is thought Nathan breathed in a 'considerable amount' of fumes, and despite desperate attempts by paramedics to save him, he later died in hospital. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Nathan’s father, Chris Harrison, said: 'We all loved Nathan dearly. We are all distraught. He was a beautiful little boy. We will miss him.' Neighbour Julie Mitchell, 35, has today told of the moment the boy’s mother raised the alarm. ‘She came round calling for help. She was screaming for her little boy,’ said Ms Mitchell. ‘The fire brigade turned up and ambulance took him away on a stretcher. ‘I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep seeing his little boy coming out of the house. It’s so sad, he was the same age as my little girl. ‘He and his brother were just cheeky little blond haired boys. They would play football together in the garden. ‘I didn’t . know them as they had only been here for a couple of months, but my . heart goes out to them. It must be so painful for the whole family.’ The . two boys had been brought out of the house by the time police arrived . and both were taken to hospital with serious injuries from smoke . inhalation, West Yorkshire Police said. Investigation: A forensic officer is seen walking to the house in Keighley, West Yorkshire, to try and determine the cause of the fire . Scene: Nathan Harrison, died in hospital after inhaling fumes from the fire which began in the bedroom of his West Yorkshire family home . Probe: The emergency services are still trying to establish the cause of the fire which started on Monday . Emergency services were called to a . house in Keighley, near Bradford, after smoke . was seen coming from a rear bedroom at the property in Sunnyhill Grove. A woman, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘There was flashing lights everywhere. ‘There were three fire engines, two ambulances and a first responder. ‘We could see smoke coming out of the upstairs window, but then we saw this little boy coming out on a stretcher. ‘It was such a sad sight to see. No parent should have to go through that. ‘We didn’t know the family but we would see the boys playing outside together, with not a care in the world. ‘It must have been terrible for him, but I hope he is now at peace.’ The cause of the fire, which was confined to the bedroom, is being investigated. The . fire service confirmed that the property was fitted with two smoke . alarms, but it is still being investigated as to whether they were . operational at the time the fire broke out.

"By . Dan Bloom For Mailonline . A domestic abuser who beat his girlfriend so badly she needed reconstructive surgery on her nose has been jailed after telling her: 'You must really like being hit'. Scott Stewart and Danielle Riseley dated on and off for eight years after they met aged 15 in Barrow, Cumbria - but Stewart turned violent just six months into the relationship. Now 23, Danielle summoned the courage to have him prosecuted after an assault in the home they shared in February which left her with a broken nose. Violence: Scott Stewart and Danielle Riseley met aged 15 (left) in Barrow, Cumbria - but Stewart turned violent just six months in to the relationship. Now 23, Danielle brought him to court after he broke her nose (right) Brave: Ms Riseley said she had decided to speak out to tell other domestic abuse victims that help is out there . The brave victim spoke out to help others after Stewart was jailed for seven months at Preston Crown Court. He pleaded guilty  to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and criminal damage - but she said the sentence did not feel like a victory. 'I am still left having panic attacks every time a door bangs or I am alone,' she said. 'I am glad that he can’t get to me any more, approach me or even come anywhere near me. 'I just hope people reading this will see this story and realise that no matter which side of the abuse you are on, there is help out there. Violence: The ex-couple in happier times . 'Without my friends and family I wouldn’t be here today. The support I have received from them has literally saved my life.' The court heard how on one occasion the 23-year-old pub worker told Ms Riseley: 'You must really like being hit'. They had dated on and off but decided to give the relationship one last try last year, the court heard. 'It never even occurred to me to not get back with him,' said Ms Riseley, who now lives on the Isle of Man. 'I loved him.' She added: 'Only his family were aware of the violence as they had to pull him off me countless times. 'They were always a great support during difficult times in our relationship. I couldn’t tell my family as I never intended for it to get as far as it did.' When they moved in together, she said, her ex-boyfriend's violence escalated. 'Without his parents there, he started to get angry at work and come home and scream,' she said. 'He claimed he cared for me but used to slap me and, as a result, I felt trapped. 'I didn’t think the police would help as I had no evidence. It was just my word against his, so even when he held my head under water and broke my nose, I couldn’t leave. 'We loved each other, we had our great days where we’d be the only two people on earth and I was certain we’d get past it and get better. But we didn’t.' It comes after prosecutors last month announced their highest ever conviction rate of domestic abusers - who now make up more than a tenth of all the crimes they deal with. Moving: Ms Riseley's plight mirrors that of more than 50,000 women across Britain in just one year . She said her ex-boyfriend's seven-month sentence did not feel like a victory, adding: 'I am still left having panic attacks every time a door bangs or I am alone. I am glad that he can’t get to me any more or approach me' Some 58,276 defendants were convicted in 2013-14 - three-quarters of all those brought to court, and up more than 6,500 on the previous year. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders claimed the rise was thanks to police working with charities and specialist case workers. She told the annual conference for the charity Women's Aid: 'Nine in ten of the domestic violence convictions arise from guilty pleas, meaning that the vast majority of victims are spared having to give evidence in court. 'I hope victims of these terrible offences will take some confidence from this, and that perpetrators will take note.'

"By . Gavin Mccafferty . Motherwell's defensive problems have only got worse ahead of their visit to Dundee United but manager Stuart McCall hopes to ease them by signing Derby centre-back Mark O'Brien later in the week. O'Brien is set to join on loan after recovering from an ankle injury he suffered last month. The 21-year-old has made 35 appearances for Derby but his progress has been hindered by two serious knee injuries. Case for the defence: Derby defender Mark O'Brien (L) is joining Motherwell on loan . His arrival will be warmly welcomed as Motherwell will still be without the injured Steven Hammell and Simon Ramsden at Tannadice on Wednesday night, while Fraser Kerr, Zaine Francis-Angol and Craig Reid played in Saturday's 1-0 win over St Mirren despite not having trained for two weeks. To add to their problems, Adam Cummins has suffered a minor strain and is out of the squad. McCall said: 'I think Mark would probably have been with us if he hadn't gone over on his ankle in pre-season. 'He has just been coming back to fitness now, so he's one we are waiting for. 'He started full training now so hopefully at the back end of the week, he will be a player we would like to get in on loan.' Stuart McCall knows Motherwell need to improve after their opening defeat to St Mirren . McCall is also working on a deal for a new striker with a loan arrangement also likely. 'If what we're working on comes off I'll be delighted,' he said. 'We've got to give it a chance. If it doesn't, we will have to look elsewhere. Rather than taking somebody else, I'd rather give it a chance.' McCall knows his side will have to improve on their showing against St Mirren when they travel to face a United side which won 3-0 at Aberdeen on Sunday. McCall labelled Nadir Ciftci 'the best striker in the league last season' while he feels Ryan Dow is more than adequate cover for the departed Ryan Gauld. Danger man: Nadir Ciftci has been labelled 'the best striker in the league last season', says Stuart McCall . 'It's got the makings of a really tough game, even if we had been at full strength,' McCall said. 'But over the years we have been to places when we're backs to the wall and people don't give us much chance, and we have shown a lot of character. We are going to need that. 'We need an improvement in performance, individually and collectively, to what we had on Saturday, and a good strong resilience in the team because most people will have them down as certainties after what they did at the weekend.'

Duke, a Great Pyrenees, won the mayoral election in Cormorant this weekend by a landslide, taking all but two or three votes. The dog, who is often seen eating hamburgers and chips in the village's pub, will be officially sworn in on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Sworn in: Duke, a Great Pyrenees, won the  election in Cormorant, Minnesota, this weekend by a landslide . New village mayor: Duke, who is seven years old, was treated to five hours of grooming after his victory . All 12 Cormorant villagers paid $1 to vote in the election, with at least nine voting for Duke. Duke won the ceremonial role after a tightly fought campaign against local store owner Richard Sherbrook. Mr Sherbrook, who voted for Duke himself, said: 'I'm going to back the dog 100 per cent. He's a sportsman and he likes to hunt. He'll really protect the town. 'There's no question that he'll do a good job representing the community.' Duke was treated to five hours of grooming after his victory and will receive a salary of a year's supply of free dog food from Tuffy's Pet Food store in the nearby village of Perham. Mayor in Minnesota: All 12 Cormorant villagers paid $1 to vote in the election, with at least nine voting for Duke . A video of Duke shows him wearing a mayoral hat, but it is not clear if he will have to wear it for all official business. Villagers say Duke, who is yet to make an inaugural address, has already started making changes in Cormorant. David Rick, who voted for the dog, said: 'What he does is when the cars are coming through town, they're hitting town at 50mph, and he slows them down. He follows me wherever I go.' Tricia Maloney also voted for Duke and said: 'He doesn't know how to handle this publicity. He won by a landslide. He's used to coming to the pub and getting some burgers and some fries or something.' Pigasus for President: A 145lb hog called Pigasus was nominated as a Presidential candidate in 1968. Just as a man was reading a nomination speech on behalf of the hog, it and seven conspirators were arrested. Vote goat: The McGillicuddy Serious Party entered a goat in the Waiheke Island election. A hedgehog also tried to run as an MP for the party but was unsuccessful in being nominated. Democratic dog: Bosco, a Labrador-Rottweiler mix, served 13 years as the mayor of Sunol, California.

"By . Anthony Bond . Payout: Rugby league star Keith Mason, 31, pictured, has been awarded almost £150,000 in damages after Super League club Huddersfield Giants sacked him when a naked picture of his teammate was posted online . A rugby league star has been awarded almost £150,000 in damages after Super League club Huddersfield Giants sacked him when a naked picture of his teammate was posted online. Former prop Keith Mason, 31, was dismissed from the team on grounds of gross misconduct last October after a picture of a fellow player's bottom appeared on Twitter. Throughout the three-day High Court battle in Leeds, Mr Mason, who claimed wrongful dismissal, maintained his former club wanted to get rid of him because of his expensive contract and that the Twitter picture was only a smokescreen. His Honour Judge Andrew Saffman ruled in favour of the player and has now awarded him £146,000 in damages. After the hearing, Mr Mason said he was going to Los Angeles with his boxing friend Joe Calzaghe to celebrate. He said: 'It’s been a stressful time and I’m glad it’s over. I will go away, enjoy myself, relax and re-charge my batteries. 'I am still in great shape and training every day and I want to move on in my career. But first I’m off to celebrate.' Mr Mason, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire., was sacked a few weeks after a picture of then teammate Scott Moore’s bottom was posted on his Twitter account where it stayed for around 48 hours. The court heard that the photograph was taken as the team celebrated after the final game of last season during a three-day 'communal bender' known in the rugby league world as ‘Mad Monday’. The club, even though it admitted it was posted without Mr Mason’s knowledge, said he brought them into disrepute by not deleting it soon enough. After playing seven seasons for the club, Mr Mason was fired with nearly three years left on his contract. The player claimed he was sacked by the club to free up space in the salary cap for new signings. At the time of his dismissal the rugby ace was one of the team’s highest paid players, with a yearly salary of £95,000. The total figure including legal costs will leave the West Yorkshire club - currently leading Super League - with a debt of around £400,000 - as Mr Mason’s legal fees are estimated to be £200,000. The club will also have to pay their own legal fees of at least £50,000. It was also revealed that Mr Mason had offered to settle just days before the case went to court - for £100,000. But the Giants responded with a paltry offer of £5,000. Dismissed:  Mr Mason, left, was sacked a few weeks after a picture of the bottom of teammate Scott Moore, right, was posted on his Twitter account where it stayed for around 48 hours . Ruling in Mr Mason’s favour last month, the judge said: 'When all is is said and done the claimant was employed as a rugby player. 'I’m not convinced that this Tweet can been seen to be inextricably linked to the club. 'I think it is very unlikely that anyone seeing this Tweet would assume that the Tweet is condoned by the club. 'Therefore I have no difficulty in finding the claimant has established on balance that this was a wrongful dismissal. 'I am satisfied that the club was keen for the claimant to go. But this was not an unhappy player. He did not want to go, he wanted to stay.' The court hearing yesterday also heard that the Giants only disclosed vital documents by court order days before the case began. The documents related to who had made complaints about the Twitter picture and about details of the signings of other players. Sacked: After playing seven seasons for the club, Mr Mason was fired with nearly three years left on his contract.  This is the Galpharm Stadium where the Huddersfield Giants play . Judge Saffman said the documents were 'clearly embarrassing' and should have been handed over at the outset. He said: 'On balance I am entitled to assume that these documents were deliberately not disclosed and, if that’s not the case, then significant efforts were not made (to find them) until the last minute.' Mason’s counsel said he was entitled to ‘indemnity costs’ because of the club’s “dismissive attitude” to the case. The judge ordered the club to pay Mr Mason’s £146,510 in damages within seven days. The club had previously been told to make a down-payment of £35,000 towards the legal fees but this was paid several days late. The judge ordered a further £5,000 to be paid. The exact costs have yet to be finalised. After the hearing, Mr Mason’s solicitor Richard Cramer confirmed his client had been on a ‘no-win, no-fee’ arrangement, which means a win bonus of between £75,000 and £100,000 payable on top of his £98,000 legal fees. Mr Cramer said: 'It has been a resounding win and Keith has been vindicated in taking the action he did. Keith has only done what he is entitled to do and I hope Huddersfield Giants comply with the court order. 'The indemnity order sent a clear message that the judge was disatisfied with the way Huddersfield conducted the case by trying to conceal significant documents.' Mason, who is coming to the end of a 12-month deal at Castleford Tigers, said he wanted to stay a Super League player. Giants managing director Richard Thewlis declined to comment.","Keith Mason was sacked from Huddersfield Giants for gross misconduct .

"By . Sam Webb . Match Of The Day pundits are being urged to be forthright in their opinions in a bid to combat their more controversial rivals on Sky and BT Sport. The BBC's flagship football show now faces unprecedented competition from their paid-for rivals and Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Rio Ferdinand have been told to be unafraid to let rip with their true opinions, however controversial. in a bid to keep ratings. Executives at the corporation are likely concerned about the departure of the outspoken Alan Hansen after 22 years on the MOTD sofa, combined with the successful pairing of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville have made Sky's Monday Night Football coverage a must-watch for lovers of the beautiful game. New era: Pundits on Match Of The Day will be more opinionated this season, says a BBC executive. Pictured (left to right), presenters Danny Murphy, Robbie Savage, Alan Shearer, Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand, Phil Neville . Mark Cole, head of football at the BBC, is trying to balance stirring up opinions with avoiding alienating the show's 10m viewers. He told The Independent: 'It's okay to have people throwing the remote controls at the telly. 'We want all the guys to offer opinions. But it needs to be balanced and they cannot be changing their minds next week. It has to come from the heart.' He added that the extensive use of technology used by Sky would not appeal to the BBC's core audience, who would find a 13-minute technical analysis 'too long, too intricate and too complicated'. Cole also addressed criticism about the absence of a woman in the MOTD line-up, claiming that pundits must have played the game at the highest level to get a spot on the sofa. However, presenters Jacqui Oatley and Gabby Logan will feature next season. The BBC has signed up Phil Neville for this season's MOTD despite his much-criticised performance in the commentary box at the World Cup. Rival: The BBC's flagship football show now faces unprecedented competition from shows like Monday Night Football on SkySports, with former players Jamie Carragher (left) and Gary Neville . The former Everton and Manchester United star is joining show veterans Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Danny Murphy alongside other newcomers Ruud Gullit and Rio Ferdinand. Neville admitted working as a commentator was 'harder' than he thought after hundreds of viewers complained about his on-air performance during the World Cup game between England and Italy. Viewers criticised his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game with several Twitter users joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville. On Neville's appointment, Cole said: 'After 22 years, Alan Hansen will no longer be with the show, but the World Cup really showcased the strength of the new BBC punditry team. 'We will continue to evolve the Saturday night panel and feel we have a really good blend of regular studio guests. 'Alan Shearer has established himself as one of the top pundits in the UK, while Danny Murphy and Philip Neville will regularly provide added tactical analysis. 'There will be strong opinions from Ruud Gullit and Robbie Savage, while Rio Ferdinand will continue to give excellent insight around his playing commitments. 'We will continue to mix our team of regular analysts with current players and managers, which featured Roy Hodgson, Thierry Henry, Vincent Kompany and Roberto Martinez last season. 'We are confident we have put together a varied team full of insight and opinion, led by Gary Lineker, who has consistently proved to be amongst the best presenters in the UK.' The show celebrates 50 years since its first broadcast this year with a one-off documentary being shown on Friday August 22.","BBC presenters have been told to be more opinionated in analysis .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Michaela Hutchings, 23, was caught using £52,000 of council money to go on a shopping spree, and was ordered to repay the cash. But she is complaining the courts targeted her because she is attractive . A single-mother facing jail after being ordered to repay £52,000 in council money she used to go on a designer shopping spree says she is being treated unfairly because of her looks. Michaela Hutchings, 23, used £51,821.34 accidentally transferred into her account by Lichfield Council to buy expensive designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a spending splurge last year. After she was caught, a judge spared her jail on the condition she paid the money back by Christmas Eve, but now she is complaining that the punishment is unfair, and that she has been made an example of because she is attractive. In an interview with The Sun, she said: 'I've done wrong but I'm only human, the same as everyone else. They're punishing me because of the way I look. 'If I wasn't much to look at and played the card of ""Oh, I only get this much a month, I was in a bit of a sticky situation"" I reckon I'd have got a slap on the wrist and just paid back a fiver a week. 'I pleaded guilty but the only person guilty is the person who put the money in my account. I don't think I should have been punished the way I was. It's just outrageous.' Bungling Lichfield District Council, Staffs, transferred the money into Hutchings account by mistake in April last year instead of paying Bromford Housing Association. Hutchings . said she only discovered the money while withdrawing cash on a trip to . buy milk, and when she quizzed her bank over the sum, they couldn't tell . her where it had come from. She . maintains that she wouldn't have touched the money had it not been for . her ex-boyfriend, who she says took her to Birmingham's Bull Ring . Shopping Centre to spend the cash. The . pair went to Selfridges where, according to Hutchings, her boyfriend . bought thousands of pounds worth of designer clothes, shoes, belts and . sunglasses. She . claims that she initially spent nothing, but on the second day treated . herself to a Gucci bag, a Louis Vuitton bag and belt and Dior . sunglasses. The glamorous single-mother found £51,821.34 in her account last year while going to buy a pint of milk that was accidentally transferred to her by Lichfield Council . Rather than return the money, she went on a two-day spending spree with her former boyfriend - splurging £9,000 in just 48 hours . In just 48 hours, she hand spent £8,000 on shopping, and used a further £1,000 to pay off an outstanding train fine that had built up. She also gave her mother £1,000, and had put a further £40,000 into savings on the advice of her bank, who were unaware of the council's mistake. Meanwhile officials at Lichfield Council had realised their error, stopped a further £44,500 being transferred, and were desperately trying to trace her to explain the error. Hutchings says she was out when two men from the council eventually arrived at her mother's house, but the next day they came back with riot police who surrounded the area. She says officers with their Tasers drawn handcuffed her, threw her into the back of a riot van, and took her to a police station where she was charged with dishonestly retaining a wrongful credit, which carries up to ten years behind bars. Hutchings was spared jail on the condition that she repay the council their money, with interest. But she now says the sentence was unfair, and claims she may appeal . She called the repayments 'outrageous' saying that, if anyone should be punished for what happened, it should be the council worker who transferred the cash . She pleaded guilty and was taken to Stafford Crown Court for sentencing, where Recorder Derek Desmond spared her prison provided she could repay £52, 465.21 - the initial sum, plus £643.87 interest. Hutchings says she immediately repaid the £40,000 she had saved, plus £3,600 left in her bank account. The council will auction off the items she bought, and then it is up to her to repay the rest. She told The Sun she is putting aside £20 a week from working in her parents' stables, but is considering appealing the terms of her 'unfair' repayments. She added: 'It's a bit outrageous, isn't it? My life has been turned upside down by all this. The person at Lichfield Council who did it shouldn't have a job. 'They have ruined a part of my life with the stress and abuse I've been through.'","Michaela Hutchings, 23, had £52,000 transferred into account by accident .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greg For Mailonline . The FBI spied on citizens who were not the subject of investigation because of typographical errors, according to a government watchdog. The Justice Department's inspector general has found that while the FBI has improved handling of national security letters, the agency could do better. The watchdog identified several areas that the FBI needs to improve upon, including the 'tendency to collect data on the wrong person because of routine mistakes.' Typos: A report has found that the FBI spied on people in error due to typographical mistakes . 'We found that the FBI's corrective measures have not completely eliminated potential intelligence violations resulting from typographical errors in the identification of a telephone number, email address, or social security number in an NSL,' the report reads. 'These typographical errors cause the FBI to request and, in some instances receive, the information of someone other than the intended target of the NSL.' National security letters allow investigators to collect private information, including from telephone companies and Internet service providers, without a judge's approval. Earlier reports from the department's inspector general identified widespread violations in the program, including information obtained in non-emergencies. Spying: Investigators can use national security letters to collect private information about citizens, including from telephone companies and Internet service providers, without a judge's approval . The report released Thursday examines the program from 2007 to 2009 and how well the FBI has implemented recommendations from the earlier reports. The inspector general says the FBI has fully implemented 31 of 41 recommendations from prior reports on the topic, but must improve in other areas, including reducing errors. It also made 10 new recommendations. The FBI says in response that it's continued making improvements in recent years. According to the National Journal, the inspector general added a footnote to the public version of the report, saying that the FBI had demanded too many redactions on the 232-page report. 'We disagree with these markings, which have the effect of redacting information that we believe is important to the public's understanding of the FBI's compliance with NSL requirements,' it reads.","The Justice Department's inspector general found the the FBI has spied on the wrong person because of 'typographical errors'

He said the suit was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery on Friday. Former Vice President Al Gore is suing Al Jazeera America, saying the news network is withholding tens of millions of dollars that it owes for buying Current TV from him and other shareholders for $500 million last year .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . David Cameron refused to break off his holiday and recall Parliament last night despite Britain deploying warplanes to Iraq. In a significant escalation of UK involvement in the crisis, the bombers will take on surveillance and reconnaissance duties. The Tornados are also capable of attacking enemy targets with bombs and missiles. Ministers have already pledged to consider supplying arms to Kurdish fighters battling against Islamic State fanatics. Scroll down for video . Exodus: Yazidi families, fleeing violence from militant forces loyal to the Islamic State in the town of Sinjar, make their way towards the Syrian border with their belongings. British Tornado jets will soon fly over Iraq . Plight: Several ministers are on holiday (left) while Yazidi people flee the terror of Mount Sinjar in Iraq . The developments raise the prospect of Britain joining the US in taking a more active role – all at a time when the country’s leaders are on holiday. The Prime Minister is in Portugal where officials insist he is in close touch with ministers and officials and is still running the country. His deputy, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, is in Spain. Home Secretary Theresa May is on an Alpine break, and First Secretary of State William Hague, who has been Mr Cameron’s official deputy in previous summers, is also abroad. It leaves Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as the most senior minister in London, even though he has only been in his job for a month. However Downing Street defied mounting calls for MPs to return to work, insisting our role was solely humanitarian. The sense of disarray at the heart of government intensified yesterday as Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds stepped down less than a week after the resignation of Baroness Warsi over what she described as the Government’s ‘morally indefensible’ position on Gaza. Exhausted: A Yazidi baby rescued from the mountains of northern Iraq by Kurdish forces as thousands flee . Tent city: Thousands of refugees from Iraq are being housed at a temporary camp in Derike, Syria . Labour accused the Government of being ‘rudderless’ and former foreign secretary Jack Straw called for a concerted action. ‘One way or another, these maniacs, these medieval maniacs in the so-called Islamic State have got to be defeated,’ he said. Number 10 said Mr Hammond was one of the most experienced ministers in government and had done sterling work in recent weeks. He chaired the emergency COBRA committee yesterday, which was attended by the new Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. But Labour said the fact that three of the Foreign Office ministers had been in the office for a month or less meant the department lacked the expertise or experience to deal with simultaneous crises in Iraq, Gaza and Ukraine. The party had to issue its statement though through junior foreign affairs spokesman John Spellar, because Labour leader Ed Miliband is also on holiday. Mr Spellar said: ‘The new Foreign Secretary has now lost two ministers in just a few days. ‘At a time when the Foreign Office should be focused both on the crisis in Iraq and the situation in Gaza following the recent appalling violence there, David Cameron’s Government instead risks looking increasingly rudderless, and characterised by confusion.’ There were continued demands for a recall of Parliament to discuss the crisis in Iraq and for potential military action by British forces. Departing minister Mr Simmonds told the Mail he would support further action to protect stricken communities in the north of Iraq. ‘If it is the collective international view that air strikes would be the best way to support the Kurds, then we should be supporting the Americans,’ he added. ‘We should be supporting the Americans in that way, but I’m not sure we should be putting troops on the ground.’ Mr Hammond dismissed the call, saying: ‘We don’t envisage a combat role at the present time. ‘We are talking at the moment about a humanitarian operation and using our assets to gain more awareness of what’s going on.’ Tory MPs Nick de Bois and David Burrowes have written to the Prime Minister urging the recall of Parliament to discuss the crises in Iraq and Gaza, while fellow Conservative Conor Burns said he wanted to send in special forces to assist Christians in Iraq. Refuge: This group of children are among some 45,000 people so far to cross the Iraq-Syria border . Tired: A Yazidi child catches a brief moment of rest as she makes her way from Mount Sinjar to Syria . Former defence minister Andrew Robathan said it was ‘no good just sending aid’ – the ‘real solution’ was to stop IS fighters. ‘There are many ways one can use military action,’ he told the BBC’s World at One. ‘Air strikes, or indeed the use of [drones], from a suitable launch site, are ways that it can be done – dare one say it – surgically without putting troops on the ground.’ Two Sentinel spy planes are also being relocated to Jordan from Oman, making them available for operations in Iraq. Lord Dannatt, the former army chief, warned the risk of a genocide unfolding meant further help should be considered, arguing that the UK shared ‘some culpability’ for the breakdown in Iraqi society. Number 10 indicated that Britain may be willing to follow the example of the US in arming Kurdish forces. The Prime Minister’s spokesman insisted Mr Cameron was ‘very much engaged’ with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’. In a further blow to the Prime Minister, Labour has jumped to a seven-point lead over the Tory party, according to a Guardian/ICM poll. Labour support has gone up five points over the past month to 38 per cent while the Conservatives have fallen by three to 31 per cent.","Tornados to carry out surveillance and are capable of attacking with missiles .

"By . Tamara Cohen . One of Alex Salmond’s chief opponents has said his ‘blokeish attitude’ has put women off him during the referendum campaign on Scottish independence. Margaret Curran, Labour’s spokesman on Scotland, was speaking after a poll found 51 per cent of women plan to vote against independence. Only 32 per cent of female voters said they planned to vote in favour, and 17 per cent were still undecided. Bloke: Salmond has been accused of putting off women, more of whom plan to reject Scottish independence . Among men, 41 per cent said they would vote Yes, 48 per cent would vote No and 11 per cent were undecided, according to the poll by Survation. The poll showed the campaign to save the Union has more than doubled its lead to a record high since the TV debate between Mr Salmond and pro-Union Alastair Darling last Tuesday when the SNP leader failed to answer key questions about the pound. Miss Curran said: ‘This blokeish attitude doesn’t work with people, especially women. I don’t think his recent performances have done him any favours.’ Women also voted in lower numbers than men for Mr Salmond’s Scottish National Party during the 2011 elections – when the party promised a referendum on independence. But earlier this month Miss Curran said there was some ‘very negative’ reaction to Mr Salmond personally on the doorstep, amid a continuing row about the currency. She said: ‘People believe he is so blinded by his dedication to independence that he’s thinking about that rather than their interests, and voters always expect you to think more about their interests.’ Labour's Margarert Curran added: 'The SNP have failed to have a message to women that works' Women in particular, she said, were more likely to vote No, because they felt a ‘wider responsibility’ for others. ‘They have to think of their family, children, grandchildren and wider community’, she said. ‘The SNP have singularly failed to have a message to women that works.’ The poll of 1,010 Scots found that 57 per cent plan to vote No next month, a 14-point lead over Yes, once the ‘don’t knows’ are excluded. This compares with a six-point lead last Sunday. It is the first time the No vote has exceeded 50 per cent since Survation began asking the question. Yesterday it emerged Mr Salmond has refused to commission any research into a separate currency – despite UK politicians ruling out sharing the pound with an independent Scotland. It led to taunts from his rivals that he had admitted he had no 'Plan B'. The Scottish Government turned down a Freedom of Information request by the Mail asking for all reports, correspondence and briefings on a new currency. It admitted it does not hold the information because the government ‘proposes that currency will continue to be the currency of an independent Scotland’. A row deepened also yesterday about the use of taxpayer-funded literature backing the independence campaign. Last week all 2.5million households in the country received a 12-page glossy government booklet entitled ‘Scotland’s future – what independence means for you’. It claimed that ‘we will get the government that Scotland votes for – every time’, a key SNP message, and that life would be ‘easier for families’ with more financial security. This is despite major firms saying they would quit Scotland with thousands of job losses if it went independent, and research from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warning an independent Scotand would have to raise taxes or slash spending. The Better Together campaign also has literature funded by the Scotland Office. But critics accused the Scottish civil service of becoming ‘politicised’ and refusing to reveal how much was spent on promotional materials.","Margaret Curran claimed there was 'very negative' reaction on doorstep .

We are continually looking at new ways to develop our international profile and our partnership with D.C. United will help us to build closer links with this key territory.'

The answer would be yes if I’m honest. ‘It’s very good business. We had a bit of a tete-a-tete, myself and the owners, more the financial people more so than Fawaz. He didn’t have a conversation with me in that respect. ‘They consulted me about a possible move, but where they fell short was to tell me they’d actually gone. But we’ve addressed that. Hierarchy: Pearce said his  fallout was primarily with head of finance Lalou Tifrit . New boss: Stuart Pearce said he was extremely disappointed with the decision . ‘I’m quite comfortable now with our relationship, they moved heaven and earth to get me these players in yesterday. It’s been an incredible week business wise, but an exciting week. ‘I’d rather it be like this rather than sedate and us doing no business at all. There’s no doubt it wasn’t right and proper what happened, whether you’d call that a breakdown in communications I don’t know. ‘But we’ve gone past that, me as an individual I’m not prepared to walk away from this club. That’s for sure. It’s like everything in football, sometimes the hierarchy at clubs fall out. But this was a reasonably public fall out. Making his mark: Al Hasawi purchased the Championship club back in 2012 . ‘Fawaz will be at the game on Saturday and I want to deliver a winning performance for him. Between the pair of us, we have the ability to push this club forwards. ‘I was excited the day I came in to work under him as manager, and I’m excited now. Success for him is success for me and vice-versa. ‘I don’t want to big headed, but I believe I am the right man for this job. I want to win promotion and aim for both cup competitions.’","Al Hasawi says Pearce was involved in negotiations throughout .

"By . Mark Wilson . Fourteen months have passed since Aleksandr Tonev first had the chance to join Celtic. It is a period that has provided precious little joy for the winger. Opting instead to move to Aston Villa in a £2.2million deal from Lech Poznan, he struggled to make any impact on Paul Lambert’s side amid the rarefied atmosphere of the Barclays Premier League. Tonev made a mere six top-flight starts before finding himself surplus to requirements this summer. Stiliyan Petrov would strongly argue, however, that his compatriot is now tailor-made for the current situation at Parkhead. VIDEO: Scroll down for boss Ronny Deila on building a new team at Celtic . New challenge: Aleksandr Tonev has joined Celtic after finding his chances at Villa Park limited . Having urged Tonev to seize the chance of a year-long loan move at the ground he once graced, Petrov firmly believes the 24-year-old will recapture top form in Glasgow. He looks at the style of play Ronny Deila wants to implement and sees Tonev as a perfect fit. The Bulgarian international, capped 15 times, completed his move on Monday night and is expected to go straight into Deila’s squad for the Champions League qualifier against Maribor next week. ‘The biggest strength Tonev has is his pace,’ said Petrov, who earned hero status at Celtic between 1999 and 2006. ‘Honestly, in footballing terms, he is lightning quick. ‘He is also equally comfortable on either foot and switches from left to right without any difficulty. He can score goals and will provide plenty of assists. He is also strong. Hero: Stiliyan Petrov hugs it out with Neil Lennon during a charity match at Celtic Park last year . ‘I believe the new Celtic manager has had Tonev on his radar for quite some time and he will be pleased to get him. He will fit into the new system very well. ‘I’m positive Tonev will do well for Celtic. He is hungry to do well and desperate to play football and enjoy it once again. That is important. ‘The last year at Aston Villa has been difficult for him but he has the mentality to put that behind him and concentrate on being successful at his new club. ‘He called me from Glasgow yesterday to say he already he has a really good feeling about the club and that they have been very professional in their early dealings with him. The club has made sure he has been made to feel welcome and has everything he needs.’ Neil Lennon was keen on landing Tonev last summer and the player may well wish he had taken up that option given his travails in England. As it was, Lennon was pipped at the post by Lambert and Tonev took up residence in the Midlands. Petrov still lives in that part of the country after retiring from playing at Villa following a gruelling battle against leukaemia. He took Tonev under his wing to try and help him settle in his new surroundings. When it became clear the winger’s future opportunities under Lambert were going to be limited, Petrov then delivered a pristine reference to his old employers at Parkhead. Premature end: Petrov was forced to retire from football following a gruelling battle against leukaemia . He has also remained a sounding board for Tonev and dispelled any doubts the younger man may have had about moving north of the border. ‘I told Tonev to join,’ said Petrov. ‘It was as simple as that. ‘He asked me about the history of the club and the supporters and I told him I had seven incredible years at Celtic and loved life in Glasgow and playing in front of the fantastic supporters inside a packed Celtic Park. But I wanted to leave to test myself in England and I also had a great time at Villa. ‘He is well aware there huge demands at Celtic and that he will be expected to help the team win every game. He has the mentality to cope with that pressure. ‘I’m sure the Celtic supporters will enjoy his style of play and they will take them to their hearts very quickly. I know he can help the club do well and would love to play in the Champions League qualifier against Maribor.’ There will be Celtic fans who question the ambition shown the club in making another loan move – following Jo Inge Berget’s arrival from Cardiff City – but it could also perhaps be viewed as a reflection on some of their recent transfer dealings. There would surely be some within Parkhead happy to have had the option to return the likes of Amido Balde or Derk Boerrigter to their former clubs after their unconvincing initial efforts. And while it’s true that few tears have been shed in Birmingham over Tonev’s exit, he does bring something that was sorely lacking in the 6-1 aggregate defeat from Legia Warsaw. Celtic looked dismally pedestrian for much of that two-legged tie and an injection of pace is urgently required if Deila’s vision for the team is to be realised. The Norwegian manager will stand or fall on landing the right players and making them shine in his system. In that respect, he must hope Petrov’s glowing appraisal of Tonev proves accurate.","Bulgarian joined SPL champions on loan following sorry spell at Aston Villa .

"By . Andy Newport, Press Association . Scotland manager Gordon Strachan offered little sympathy to Legia Warsaw following their desperate attempt to persuade Celtic to give up their Champions League slot. The Polish champions were thrown out of the competition for fielding an ineligible player in the second leg of their 6-1 third qualifying round clash with Strachan's old side. The Parkhead outfit have now been given a second chance of landing a £20million jackpot and a slot in the competition's group stages after they were handed Legia's play-off round place. Let off? Celtic were handed a Champions League lifeline despite losing 6-1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw . Rules are rules: Former Celtic boss and current Scotland manager Gordon Strachan has no sympathy for Legia . Keep your heads down, boys: Celtic have been accused of ignoring calls and emails from Legia Warsaw . Ineligible: Bartosz Bereszynski (right) was deemed to be playing illegally, seeing Legia stripped of their place . But on Sunday, the angry Poles held a press conference and even released an open letter to the Hoops as they questioned the honour of the club's hierarchy. They have demanded a rematch in order to decide who faces Slovenians Maribor but Strachan insists Legia will have to take their punishment. 'That's the rules,' said the Dark Blues boss. 'It's the same in golf. If it's a windy day and the ball moves or oscillates as you're addressing it, that's a penalty. 'Every sport has its rules and you have to stick by them. But most of us have all been hit by these rules somewhere along the line.' Celtic thought their Champions League hopes were over after sustaining a crushing 4-1 defeat in Warsaw. It was just new boss Ronny Deila's third match in charge but when Legia blundered by playing the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski, the Norwegian was handed a reprieve. Now Strachan has tipped the former Stromsgodset manager to bounce back from the pounding his team took in the Polish Army Stadium. Embarrassing: Celtic had crashed out after losing 2-0 at home to the Polish club following defeat away . Reprieve: Celtic have refused to accept Legia Warsaw's pleas to give up their place in the next round . He suffered a humiliating 5-0 thrashing by Artmedia Bratislava in his first match as Celtic boss back in July 2007 but went on to become the first Parkhead manager since Jock Stein to win three Scottish titles in a row. Deila's predecessor Neil Lennon, meanwhile, suffered European set-backs during his first full season in charge but lead his side to a famous win over Barcelona and the Champions League last 16 a year later. 'I'm still looking at the team-sheet to see how many of the team in Bratislava are ineligible,' joked Strachan, whose side failed to progress despite a 4-0 win in the Parkhead return. 'I will need to get Peter Lawwell to go over that just in case I'm due a bonus for getting through to the next round. 'But getting over a bad result like that can be done. Lenny had a poor start and did well and these things are sent to test you. 'Everyone in football will have their character tested but we wish Ronny the best of luck.' Speaking at Heriott Watt University as the third intake of youngsters were welcomed into the Scottish Football Association's Performance Schools system, Strachan also reflected on a summer that has seen three Scottish youngsters seal big-money moves. Give him time: Strachan thinks new Celtic manager Ronny Deila (pictured) can make a success of the job . Success: Strachan won three Scottish titles despite a terrible start to his tenure in the Champions League . Unhappy: Legia Warsaw manager Henning Berg was unhappy to see his side kicked out of the competition . Dundee United's Ryan Gauld clinched a £3m switch to Sporting Lisbon, while Tannadice team-mate Andy Robertson moved to Hull for £2.85m. St Johnstone's Stevie May has also landed a £800,000 transfer to Sheffield Wednesday but Strachan would rather see his nation's best talent stay north of the border. 'It would be better for me if we had the finances in this country that nobody would need to move,' he said. 'Walter Smith told me four or five years ago that there were 70-odd players who had played in the Scottish Premiership that were now playing in the English Championship. 'If we had kept them here, just think what a fantastic league we could have. 'The trouble is if you develop good players, people want to buy them. Just look at Southampton. They do well then £100millions worth (of talent) moves on. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW! There’s £60,000 in prizes including £1,000 up for grabs EVERY WEEK… . 'That's what happens and what will always happen - the top club will come in and take your players. 'What I would like to see in years to come is Real Madrid, Barcelona, Man United buying our players again. That would be better for everyone.' Open letter: Legia Warsaw co-owner Dariusz Mioduski, has asked for a one off game to settle the issue .","Legia fielded an ineligible player in second leg of third qualifying round .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Jose Mourinho has warned his title rivals that he is building another Chelsea empire fit to last for up to a decade at the top. Mourinho has been thrilled with the impact of his £75million trio of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis and the way they have responded to his demands in pre-season, adding to the feeling his may be the team to beat in the title race. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho: Chelsea have been waiting for a player like Costa . Summer recruit: Goal-scoring striker Diego Costa has made an instant impact at Chelsea . Main man: Veteran defender John Terry remains an integral part of Mourinho's plans . The Chelsea boss is confident the new recruits have added the missing ingredient to a squad packed with young and emerging talent and which retains a sprinkling of grisly know-how in the shape of John Terry and Didier Drogba. ‘We have the squad that we want to have,’ said Mourinho. ‘We don’t say it’s perfect, we don’t say it’s the best. There is no manager in the world that says his squad is perfect and could not improve in certain positions. ‘We say we like very much our squad. It is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So, I like my squad very much.’ Drive: Spaniard Cesc Fabregas will add energy and direction to the Chelsea midfield . Mourinho applauded the Stamford Bridge board for striking fast to fulfil his requests in the transfer market. ‘I love the club because the club was fantastic and gave me the three targets I was asking for, in the left back, a midfield player and a striker,’ he said. ‘In fact, they gave me two strikers because Didier is also back. ‘We have bought three people in Filipe, Diego and Fabregas, all in the best stage for a football player, between 25 and 30. They are three experienced players with quality to strengthen immediately our team. Last season we went into the season with a different profile when we bought people like Mohamed Salah and Andre Schurrle; people that needed some time. We also went to people like Kurt Zouma, but these players — Cesc, Costa and Luis — are ready. ‘The squad improves, for sure, and the team can show qualities on the pitch that in the past we didn’t. The team has to be better. But obviously, this is the Premier League and every team tries to be better, especially at the top. Influence: Left back Filipe Luis will add valuable experience to Jose Mourinho's squad . ‘Are we ready for that? Yes we are but this is England. In other countries the title race is between two teams and sometimes only one. Here it is between five or six.’ Chelsea’s summer recruitment drive has been offset by the sale of David Luiz and Romelu Lukaku, just as their moves in January for Nemanja Matic, Salah and Zouma was offset by the sale of Juan Mata and Kevin de Bruyne. It is dividend for their policy to buy younger players with a sell-on value, in line with UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules. Even if that policy cost them a few trophies in the past couple of years, Mourinho has been able to raise funds for his rebuilding programme. Special one: Mourinho hopes to get the best out of Eden Hazard this season . VIDEO Chelsea our biggest danger - Tueart . When Chelsea beat Real Sociedad on Tuesday in their final pre-season friendly before they start the Barclays Premier League campaign at Burnley, they had the look of a vintage Mourinho team, akin to the one he assembled at Chelsea 10 years ago and which lasted the best part of a decade. It looked well-balanced, with a ruthless physical presence. There was a giant goalkeeper, two big centre halves, the giant Matic prowling midfield, flanked by the energy of Fabregas and Ramires, with the muscle and goal threat of Costa up front. This framework, Mourinho hopes, will get the best from Eden Hazard, Schurrle and Oscar. If there is a weakness, they are vulnerable should Costa or Matic be ruled out long-term, for any reason. There is also a shortage of homegrown players, which limits their scope to sign any more foreign players, even if they wanted to. Mourinho ruled out the idea he wanted Roma’s Moroccan centre half Medhi Benatia, valued at £30m. ‘We’re not interested,’ the manager said. ‘We have Terry, (Gary) Cahill, (Branislav) Ivanovic and Zouma. ‘And we want to make Andreas Christensen step-by-step part of the squad. He’s training with us every day, playing a few minutes with us when it’s possible, playing in the Under 21s and training with us as a first-team squad member.’ Zouma, signed from St Etienne in January, is 19 but Mourinho plans to keep him at Chelsea as defensive cover rather than loan him out. Christensen is a highly-rated, 18-year-old Dane, who has graduated from the academy like Nathan Ake, a 19-year-old Dutch defender, who impressed at left back against Real Sociedad. These teenagers are important to the squad. There are 18 senior foreign players for only 17 places in the official Premier League squad. The most obvious omission before the end of the month is either Petr Cech or Thibaut Courtois. Mourinho says he will inform his goalkeepers on Sunday who will be his No 1 and the other is unlikely to be content to sit on the bench for the entire season. Mark Schwarzer is at the club as back-up. Victor Moses, back after a year on loan at Liverpool, could have a role to play as Chelsea try to balance their squad numbers because he was ‘homegrown’, by Crystal Palace. ‘We have one problem to resolve,’ said Mourinho. ‘We have one extra foreign player in at the moment and Victor is not a foreign player. ‘Victor’s best position is on the wings where we have many solutions. We have Hazard, Willian, Salah and Schurrle but he (Moses) is English and at this moment we have one foreign player who has to leave. ‘So until the end of the month we have to make that decision and Victor is involved in this process. Maybe stays or maybe leaves. ‘Because he is English, it is something we have to analyse as well.’ Apart from this minor irritation, it is easy to understand why Mourinho is excited about the season ahead and he has refused to rule Drogba out of Monday’s game at Burnley, even though the 36-year-old striker twisted an ankle in Sunday’s friendly against Ferencvaros. ‘I don’t want to say he’s ready on Monday but with the quality of our medical department and the mentality that he has, I’m not saying it is impossible for him to recover,’ said Mourinho.","Mourinho feels Chelsea are team to beat in Premier League title race .

The 33-year-old left-back had won five Premier League titles and the Champions League at Old Trafford but decided to leave after eight years in a £1.2m deal. And the Frenchman could be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja-vu as he touched down in Sydney, for he was there with United 12 months ago at the very start of the ill-fated David Moyes reign.

Juventus won the Scudetto by a 17-point margin last season, their third successive title win, but saw coach Antonio Conte depart over the summer.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Ireland caused one of the great upsets in Women's Rugby World Cup history as they beat New Zealand 17-14 in Pool B. The Black Ferns have won the last four tournaments and had not lost a World Cup game since a defeat to the United States in the semi-finals in 1991. They began reasonably well and led 8-0 courtesy of a Kelly Brazier penalty and Selica Winiata's try but Heather O'Brien's score, which was then converted by Niamh Briggs, cut the deficit to just one point at the break. Unforgettable: Ashleigh Baxter, Ailis Egan and Vikki McGinn of Ireland embrace after their wonderful win . Brazier's second penalty extended New Zealand's lead but when Alison Miller went over with Briggs again adding the extras, it was the Irish who led by three. Another Brazier penalty levelled the scores but Briggs slotted one of her own with 10 minutes remaining and Ireland held on for a famous victory. The result moved Ireland to the top of Pool B ahead of their final group match against Kazakhstan on Saturday. England made it two from two at the Women's Rugby World Cup in France, beating Spain 45-5 in the Pool A clash. Head coach Gary Street's side scored six tries to Spain's one, with Kay Wilson, Danielle Waterman, Laura Keates, Claire Allan and Marlie Packer - with two - all scoring and Emily Scarratt adding 15 points with the boot. After a cagey opening England broke the deadlock when a deft grubber through from fly-half Ceri Large bounced perfectly for Wilson to jump on for her third try of the tournament. On the run: Danielle Waterman breaks through to score a try during the IRB Women's Rugby World Cup match . Scarratt converted the try from wide, and the Lichfield centre duly added a penalty after 33 minutes. At 10-0 Spain continued to press, but some dancing feet from Waterman saw her get over the line for her 35th international try. England went into the break 17-0 up, and started the second half with real pace. First, Keates rumbled over to score after strong work from the pack before Allan was on hand to finish off a smart team move across the line for 31-0 and the bonus point. Scarratt converted both with ease and had her sixth successful kick after Packer barged her way over the line for her first try of the World Cup. With just over 10 minutes to play Spain were rewarded with their first try after a spell of pressure on England's line - Marina Bravo eventually diving over. But it was England who had the final say. Packer scored her second try after more strong work from the pack and Scarratt rounded off the win with the conversion, her seventh from seven attempts. Held up: Ceri Large of England is tackled by Marina Bravo and Paula Medin of Spain . Wales saw their Women's World Cup semi-final hopes ended by an emphatic defeat against Australia in Marcoussis. Wales, emphatically beaten by hosts France in their opening game, were no match for an Australian side that ran out 25-3 victors.","Ireland beat New Zealand 17-14 to complete one of the great tournament upsets .

"By . Julian Robinson . Rolf Harris, pictured, has been handed a job as a prison gardener, it has emerged . Rolf Harris has angered fellow inmates after being handed a ‘plum job’ as a prison gardener, it has been claimed. The paedophile was given the task just weeks after being convicted - and other prisoners believe he may have ‘jumped the queue’ to land the cushy role. According to a report in The Sun, Harris, 84, is now being paid to look after the vegetable patch and parts of the grounds at Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire. But one prisoner said he had been waiting 12 months for a similar job. 'Harris should be cleaning the toilets after what he did, it's completely unfair,' he told The Sun. Another reportedly said: 'We all know he is a creative man but that doesn't mean he should get the plum job.' The Sun reports a source as confirming that prison bosses had agreed to let him work in the gardens but dismissed claims he had jumped the queue to land the job. Prisoners are said to earn around £9.60 a week for carrying out jobs ranging from cooking and cleaning to gardening and carpentry. A Prison Service spokeswoman told the newspaper that it did not comment on individuals. The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was jailed for five years and nine months for his decades preying on victims including Wendy Wild, Australian Tonya Lee and another girl who was in her early teens, and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years. Rolf Harris, pictured in 2001, was handed the job of looking after the prison vegetable patch just weeks after being convicted . Earlier this month it was confirmed that lawyers representing Harris have lodged papers at the Court of Appeal asking for permission to appeal against his conviction for 12 counts of indecent assault. He has already been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and faces losing his prestigious CBE in the wake of his conviction. His multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.","The entertainer has been given job as prison gardener, it has been claimed .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . The first series was filled with such unremitting doom and gloom, viewers switched off in their droves. But in an effort to lighten the misery, it seems The Village has upset its remaining fans by veering into farce. The BBC costume drama was likened to a ‘Carry On film’ yesterday after it featured a string of smutty jokes, full nudity and racy gay kiss in its opening episode. Scroll down for video . Julian Sands (right) plays Lord Kilmartin in BBC's The Village with Daniel Ezra who plays Ghana Jones (left) And despite its new upbeat tone, ratings for the drama - which was originally seen as a potential rival to ITV’s Downton Abbey - continued to slide. An average audience of just 4.6million tuned in on Sunday night, compared to the 6.4million who watched the opening episode last year, and the 4.1million who watched the season one finale. Much of the plotline was focused on the aristocratic Allingham family, who spend the first episode trying to impress their distinguished house guest Lord Kilmartin. In a string of sexually suggestive scenes, Lady Allingham, played by Juliet Stevenson, appeared intent on seducing her visitor and delivered several racy puns. In one highly-charged moment, Lord Kilmartin came down for breakfast after striding topless around the balcony of the house and started flirting with his hostess. After reminding him he is a married man, Lady Allingham lowered her voice to a husky drawl and asked him: ‘Now the pressing question is, how do you like your sausage?’ Many viewers were left in no doubt she intended the remark to be a rude innuendo. Writing on Twitter, viewer Sharon MacDonald said she felt the comment was ‘filth’. Michael Kelly added: ‘Hold on!! Light relief with a sausage joke!’ Lorna Wilde said: ‘How do you like your sausage in the morning?”, oh aye.’ Several viewers took to Twitter to discuss the BBC costume drama which was likened to a ‘Carry On film’ Viewers switched off in droves after a gloomy first series (pictured is Derek Riddel who plays Bill Gibby) The series has been written by Peter Moffat who was inspired by his grandparents who were shepherds . As the episode wore on, Lady Allingham continued to shock viewers with her off-the-cuff remarks. At a family drinks party, she looked knowingly at another guest as she asked him how to pronounce the word ‘cocktail’, saying ‘Does one put the stress on ‘cock’ or ‘tail?’” In other scenes that were equally far removed from the gentility normally expected in costume dramas, a character repeatedly used the ‘f- word’ and described heiress Edwina Mountbatten as a ‘maniac for sex’. In another sexually charged scene, the heir to the Allingham fortune engaged in a furtive kiss with another man that threatens to derail his political career. Meanwhile, the village fete descended into farce when a visiting boxer stripped off and walked completely naked through a throng of onlookers. On Twitter, a viewer writing under the name Hayley commented: ‘So The Village has gone from wrist slitting depression to Carry On innuendo in the space of one series.’ John Simm, plays John Middleton, in the series which was criticised on Twitter by viewers yesterday . Mary Middleton with Grace Middleton (left) in the series and Norma Hankin and Arnold Hankin (right) Another wrote on the BBC Points of View messageboard: ‘It seemed a lot more Downton Abbey or Larkrise than the first season. Even the livelihood threatening stuff about Mr Middleton not being able to pay the rent on the cowshed seemed to be played more for laughs than we’d have seen in the first season.’ A third said: ‘It all seemed to be a bit dumbed down, about Nasty Toffs versus the Downtrodden Poor. Lord Kimbolton [sic] was ridiculous. And I’m not one to really notice background music, but this was awful, and syrupy! ‘I enjoyed the first series but won’t be bothering with the rest of this one. Last time the complaints were it was to grim and dark, now it’s dumbed down and syrupy.’ The bleak atmosphere of The Village last year was blamed in part on a particularly harsh winter experienced in the Peak District where the drama is filmed. But the current series was shot in the spring and summer to lighten the tone. In June, its star Maxine Peake, 40, promised it would be ‘a little bit lighter’ with ‘more joy’, adding: ‘Life was bleak in those villages, trying to work a farm in those conditions... But we’re in the 1920s now.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The shift in tone is in line with the time period as the life of the village moves away from the horror of war and into the roaring Twenties.’","Viewers switched off in droves after a gloomy first series by Peter Moffat .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Michael Schumacher was involved in a road accident with a motorbike rider in Spain just weeks before his horror ski crash, it emerged yesterday. The Formula 1 driver, 45, was allegedly driving a hire car when he knocked the man off his bike when he failed to give way at a roundabout. A court is still looking into the crash in Seville on November 17. The motorcyclist apparently broke his wrist when hit by Schumacher’s rented Audi A4. Denial: Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said the waking-up process remained 'unchanged' 'On hold': A German magazine claimed the slow waking-up process had been halted last week . The case is not expected to go to trial as the racing driver’s insurer will pay compensation. It comes as Felipe Massa has claimed he saw Michael Schumacher's mouth move as he spoke to him in hospital. The . racing driver said he feels 'very positive' about his friend's . condition following a recent visit to the seven-time Formula One . champion in hospital. When asked about his friend's condition by journalists, Massa replied: 'He was sleeping, and I was very . positive because he was normal. Hope: Felipe Massa has claimed he saw Schumacher's mouth move as he spoke to him . Optimism: Massa says he told 'sleeping' Schumacher all about his car and prospects for the coming season . 'He looks normal, and he also gave some reactions with the mouth and everything. So it's positive to look at him. 'I have no experience to say anything. I'm not a doctor. But when I saw him, for me, it looked very positive.' It is almost eight weeks since Schumacher was placed in an induced coma following a skiing accident. He required two operations to remove blood clots from his brain following his fall in December. Trials: Williams driver Massa has been in Bahrain for Winter Testing since Wednesday . Schumacher . is currently in what manager Sabine Kehm described as a 'waking-up process' from his coma. Prior to this week's second pre-season . test in Bahrain, Massa visited Schumacher at the Grenoble hospital where . the former Ferrari star has been recovering. Speaking to reporters at the Sakhir circuit, Massa said: 'I always try to be optimistic. 'I . saw him, I talked to him, I told him everything I did in Jerez (at the . first test), about my car, the new team (Williams), everything. I told . him to wake up many times... I'm positive. We need to believe. 'It's always very difficult to say because I have zero experience about what the doctors say. 'But I saw him and was very happy to be together with him for a very long time, talking to him, trying to give the best energy and just help him. 'He's a very strong man, a very great man and I really hope he can wake up, and I really hope he can enjoy his life again.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Rolf Harris's wife Alwen Hughes has visited her disgraced paedophile husband in his Oxfordshire prison.

Mrs Harris, who attended almost every day of Harris's lengthy trials for indecent assault, seemed to put on a brave face before seeing Harris, who is serving a six-year prison sentence for 12 indecent assaults on four girls. The disgraced entertainer is applying for permission to appeal against his conviction. Yesterday a spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed that lawyers for the 84-year-old had lodged papers at the Court of Appeal this week. Jailed: Harris was given a five year, nine-month prison sentence, against which he hopes to appeal . His victims include an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years. Harris, who will serve just under three years in prison under the current terms of his sentence, has been spat at by another inmate at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire, but was not hurt. He has already been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and faces losing his prestigious CBE in the wake of his conviction, and his multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims. The court will now consider whether to grant permission for him to continue with his appeal bid. Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls during his trial, with jurors told how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide. His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE. The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims. Loyal: Alwen Hughes attended almost every day of Harris's trial at Southwark crown court. She is pictured above (second from left) with the shamed entertainer (centre). His daughter Bindi (right) and niece Jenny (left) were also regularly by his side . Unmasked: Harris was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault, and has been stripped of awards and accolades since . Harris was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which spanned between 1968 and 1986. Earlier this week the Attorney-General's Office confirmed that the sentence would not be referred to the Court of Appeal for being unduly lenient. Attorney General Jeremy Wright decided not to take action despite his office receiving 150 complaints about the leniency of Harris's sentence, of which he will serve half, although it only takes one complaint to trigger the review process.","Alwen Hughes, 82, was seen outside Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire .

"By . Jamie Carragher . On my way home from White Hart Lane on Sunday evening, I sent Steven Gerrard a message as I do after most Liverpool games. Normally I’ll ask him how he felt the match went or for his views on any major talking points but this time, having watched Liverpool dismantle Manchester United, no questions needed answering. So I punched the words ‘Twice as good as 2009’ into my phone. I know what it is like to go to Old Trafford and win by three goals but I couldn’t tell you how it feels to go there, play United off the park and make them spend the last 10 minutes chasing shadows as Liverpool’s ecstatic fans shout ‘Ole!’ with each tormenting pass. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Liverpool's win at Old Trafford . Togetherness: Liverpool were outstanding at Old Trafford, despite United's indiscipline . Jubliation: Gerrard and Suarez slide in front of the travelling Liverpool fans after going 2-0 up . Look familiar? Gerrard kissing the camera in 2009, and again on Sunday after scoring his second . Close: Carragher tackling Ji-Sung Park in 2009. Liverpool ended up four points off United . When we won 4-1 in March 2009, the . final score was a little distorted. Don’t get me wrong, our display was . superb but we had to deal with spells of pressure, trailed to a . Cristiano Ronaldo penalty and only pulled away in the last 13 minutes . with two goals after Nemanja Vidic had been sent off. I . remember the celebrations in the away end being raucous and we were . delighted as we walked off the pitch, yet our elation was tempered. We . were still four points behind United, having played a game more. We . hoped we would win the title but they still held the upper hand. Sunday’s . performance, however, was completely different. United may be an . inferior side to the team they were five years ago but that should not . detract one bit from what Liverpool did to them. The intent was there . from the first kick and 6-0 at the final whistle wouldn’t have been . flattering. What’s more, the . impact of the result and performance will have been felt across . Manchester at the Etihad Stadium, reaching Stamford Bridge and the . Emirates Stadium in the process. Nobody will dare underestimate . Liverpool now. Manuel . Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger will have looked at the two . games Liverpool have just faced, away trips to United and Southampton, . and probably expected them to return with, at best, four points. That . they have come through them with six unanswered goals, maximum points . and confidence soaring will be causing Pellegrini, Mourinho and Wenger . concern. The more they get into this race, the more impressive Liverpool . look. Contrast: Suarez gives his side the thumbs up as Wayne Rooney complains to his team-mates . Identical: The penalties were similar, but Liverpool are far and away a better side than United this term . Times are changing: Manchester United fans show their emotions in the stands as their side crumbles . On fire: Back then, Fernando Torres was Liverpool's hit man. Now Luis Suarez is more than filling his boots . Full credit to . Brendan Rodgers, who is handling the situation supremely well. What you . get with Brendan is exactly what you see. In his interviews and in the . technical area, he never gets over-excited, always remaining in control. That’s . what you want from a manager — focus and composure, a clear plan and . unshakeable belief in his methods. He is a coach who thinks . progressively, coaxing improvement from his players with encouragement . and giving them opportunities. We . get told constantly about the problems with the British game. How . players can’t play the right way or retain possession, yet here is a . British manager defying the critics and showing it is possible for young . players to play with style and great technique. All yours: Gerrard celebrates as Wayne Rooney scratches his head in dismay . Up and down: United are now 14 points behind Liverpool, who are now major contenders for the title . He . has been repaid with consistent performances and increasingly . impressive results and you only have to see how Jon Flanagan, Raheem . Sterling and Jordan Henderson have come of age during this campaign, . maturing from boys to men. Sterling . must now be a certainty to make the World Cup squad. He knows how to . use his explosive pace and he has an end product to go with his skill. Flanagan, meanwhile, is putting himself into contention to be on the . plane. England are well . stocked for full backs but if something were to happen to Glen Johnson . or Kyle Walker, Flanagan should be the first port of call. He is more . than just someone who can make a tackle and he is versatile, uses the . ball well and is growing in confidence. In his wake: Jon Flanagan put in a fantastic performance at Old Trafford, one of many this season . Wing wizard: Liverpool's Raheem Sterling has been in magnificent form in recent months . As it stands: The Premier League top four, but Liverpool's big games are at Anfield . On course for glory: Chelsea currently lead the Premier League despite their weekend slip-up . Been there, done that: City won the title two years ago, can they repeat the feat? Kings of north London: Arsenal won at Spurs to keep their title dreams alive . What . I like most about Brendan is that he is brave. Some managers won’t . tackle issues but Brendan is proactive. Within weeks of  getting the . Liverpool job, he sent Andy Carroll, the  British record transfer fee, . out on loan to West Ham. The popular Pepe Reina, similarly, was loaned . to Napoli. His handling of . Luis Suarez, most impressively, was strong. Even when Luis was trying to . force through a move to Arsenal, Brendan wasn’t afraid to discipline . him, making him train on his own after he had overstepped the mark with . comments he made in the media. Brendan . has the trust of his players and they respond positively to how he . treats them. He is honest and wants to help them improve. He places a . big emphasis on having respect and the camaraderie between coaching . staff and squad is evident. No messing around: Rodgers shipped £35million signing Andy Carroll out to West Ham on loan immediately . Achievement: It took Rafael Benitez a few years to push Liverpool up to title contenders before leaving the club in 2010, despite winning the Champions League in his first season in charge . Success elsewhere: Gerard Houllier delivered on the cup front but only got close to the title once . The great: Winning the title would be on a par with Bill Shankly's FA Cup triumph in 1965 . On a par: Bob Paisley's European Cup success of 1977 would also be matched with a title win . Liverpool, . certainly, have the momentum with them and the biggest compliment you . can give Brendan is that he has manoeuvred the club into a position to . challenge for the title so quickly; Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, . for instance, took four seasons to get there. If . Liverpool were to do it, the achievement would be on a par with Bill . Shankly’s FA Cup triumph in 1965 or Bob Paisley’s European Cup success . of 1977. Even though Liverpool have won 18 titles, this would feel like a . first, such is the hunger and desire to get there. Will . they do it? They definitely have the right weapons. Liverpool look . strong whereas you can question their rivals: will Chelsea pay for the . lack of a top-class striker? Is Manchester City’s defence strong enough? Do Arsenal have the players to produce when it matters? Six pointer: Liverpool face Manchester City at Anfield on April 13. They lost the reverse fixture 2-1 . Vital: They then host Chelsea on April 27, who they also lost 2-1 to at Stamford Bridge . There . will be more twists and turns and Liverpool are going to have to . prepare themselves for something not going their way over the next nine . games. How they handle a tense situation will be the real test. I am certain, though, that the two Anfield games against Chelsea and City will determine the outcome of the title race. The . best atmosphere I ever played in was in 2005, in the Champions League . semi-final, when we beat Chelsea 1-0, a night when the  stadium . literally shook. Should  Liverpool repeat that score on April 27 the . atmosphere, like Sunday’s performance at Old Trafford, will be on . another level. Tough: Brendan Rodgers has made some brave decisions since being appointed Liverpool boss in 2012 .","Liverpool went to Old Trafford and played Manchester United off the park .

"By . Associated Press . A transgender man in Arizona who gave birth to three children after beginning to change from female to male can continue to pursue a divorce, a state appeals court said Wednesday in reversing a judge who refused to end the marriage. A three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled that Thomas Beatie's marriage to Nancy Beatie in Hawaii in 2003 is considered valid in Arizona and concluded it wasn't a same-sex union. Last year, a lower court judge denied the divorce request and ruled that Arizona's ban on same-sex marriages prevented the marriage from being recognized as valid. Scroll down for video . Transitions: The so-called 'pregnant man' had three children while married to his wife and transitioning from male to female. Now Thomas Beatie wants to transition to the single life . Beatie, 40, began to change sex before the marriage but retained female reproductive organs and became pregnant three times with donated sperm when Nancy Beatie was unable to have children. The couple eventually moved to Arizona and sought a divorce a few years later. Thomas Beatie was born a woman in Hawaii and as an adult underwent a double-mastectomy and chest reconstruction surgeries, and began testosterone hormone therapy and psychological treatment to become a man. Sixteen months ago, Maricopa County Family Court Judge Douglas Gerlach concluded the marriage appeared to be a same-sex union because it was between a woman and a person who was capable of giving birth. Family: Thomas Beatie is pictured here in happier times with his family including wife Nancy, Austin, Susan and Jensen . The family court judge also found he had no jurisdiction to handle the divorce request because there was insufficient evidence that Beatie was a man when he got married, even though he had his Hawaii driver's license and birth certificate changed to say he was a man. The Arizona appeals court ruled that . Beatie's marriage in Hawaii was valid and noted that he didn't withhold . his transgender status from officials in Hawaii. The . panel said it was obligated to let people who get their birth . certificates changed to reflect a new gender status the rights connected . to their amended status - and doing otherwise would run afoul of . equal-protection rights protections. 'It's . a precedent-setting case that will protect a lot of families,' said . Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian . Rights. Media darling? Beatie made worldwide headlines when he the media got a hold of his shocking story and photos of him heavily pregnant while sporting a goatee . Minter, an expert in family law involving gay, lesbian and transgender people, said the last time an appeals court made a ruling in a divorce case involving a transgender person was in the late 1970s in New Jersey - and the court in that case found the validity of the marriage in question. Both sides in the Beatie case were pressing the courts to allow a divorce and made similar arguments. 'I am somewhat surprised that it did get reversed, because your chances are very minimal on getting things reversed,' said David Higgins, an attorney for Nancy Beatie. Attorney David Michael Cantor, who represents Thomas Beatie, said the ruling will help his client close this chapter of his life, and it brings legal recognition to his marriage. 'The state of Arizona has officially recognized him as a man and that his marriage was valid, and because his marriage was valid, his kids were born in wedlock, which is important to him,' Cantor said.","Thomas Beatie, 40, began to change sex before his marriage to Nancy Beatie in Hawaii in 2003 .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Passengers flying with Ryanair are being forced to sign a waiver agreeing not to hold the budget airline responsible for damaged suitcases. Holidaymakers jetting off to Malta from the UK claim they were told they would not be allowed to check in hold luggage without signing the document. And they allege that when they arrived at Malta International Airport from Stansted in Essex on Wednesday, their suitcases were damaged. Scroll down for video . New demands: Ryanair is allegedly forcing passengers flying from Stansted to Malta to sign a waiver . Declaration: The ticket that was stuck on to passengers luggage from Ryanair . The passengers claim they were told the system was introduced because of a surge in incidents at Malta International Airport. And they said Ryanair slapped a bright . green sticker on their luggage - in a bid to cut down on any potential . lawsuits arising from damaged bags. The . tag that was stuck on passengers' bags reads: ‘Limited release. Carriers participating in the transport of this item may not accept . claims resulting from the above conditions of acceptance. ‘This is not the Luggage Ticket (Baggage Check) described in Article 4 of the Warsaw Convention.’ One traveller, a 27-year-old marketing specialist from London, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn't believe what they were forcing me to sign. I'm away for two weeks - of course I'm going to have hold luggage. No claim: Passengers were told to sign a document stating they wouldn't sue the airline for damaged luggage . ‘When I picked up my Samsonite suitcase in Malta it had been badly scratched and part of the case had cracked. ‘Those bags are designed to be tough, so for something to crack it like that must have involved a heck of a lot of force.’ Another passenger on the same flight also reported their bag had been damaged. He said: ‘There were a lot of angry faces around the carousel, so I think most of the passengers had something bad happen to their bag. ‘A bottle of aftershave was smashed and has leaked all over my clothes, and now I can't claim against Ryanair. My holiday is ruined.’ Forced to sign: Passengers on board the flight from Essex to Malta were asked to sign the disclaimer . Officials from Malta International Airport have also hit out at Ryanair for forcing passengers to sign the disclaimer, because they have had no complaints about their handling of luggage. Joe Bugeja, chief operations officer GlobeGround Malta Limited, the company that handles Ryanair luggage at the airport, said they had no knowledge of this new policy before they saw the stickers. A spokesman for Malta International Airport added: ‘We reaffirm that this is a handling function of GlobeGround Malta. ‘Nevertheless, we shall be seeking clarification from Ryanair accordingly.’ Ryanair released a statement but declined to comment on any individual situation. The statement read: 'If a customer is travelling with a bag that has any damage (minor/major) they are requested to complete a limited release tag so we can identify that the bag had been previously damaged prior to carriage on board a Ryanair flight. 'Ryanair processes baggage claims in full accordance with the Montreal Convention and Ryanair's General Terms and Conditions of Carriage.'","Travellers on flight from Essex to Malta claim forced to sign document .

"By . Hamish Mackay . Gary Lineker has accused Premier League clubs of being greedy over ticket prices, saying there is no need for them to charge as much as they do. As Sportsmail revealed on Sunday, more than half of all top-flight English clubs have raised their prices for the coming season - despite new TV deals bringing in £5.5billion over a three year period. And Lineker tweeted: 'There is absolutely no need . for Premier league clubs to charge what they do given TV revenues these . days. It's pure avarice!' VIDEO Scroll down to watch much happier Coventry fans pitch invading in a crazy storm . Hike: Premier League fans are set to face price rises yet again . Unfair: BBC presenter Gary Lineker says price rises are unjustified considering TV revenue . Arsenal's ticket pricing has been under . scrutiny for some time, with opposition fans being extremely vocal in . their unhappiness at having to party extortionate prices to attend . matches the Emirates. The Football Supporters Federation (FSF) are planning a march in protest and their chairman Malcolm Clarke said: 'Nine out of 10 fans already think they are paying too much for tickets and these figures only back that point of view. ‘Clubs . are swimming in cash and the last media deal was worth £5bn. The huge . increase would have been enough for clubs to let every fan in for free . and they would have been no worse off. ‘Top-flight clubs need to think long-term and cut prices. Never mind all the clever PR strategies clubs come out with, nothing would earn goodwill like dropping prices. ‘The FSF will lead a march on Premier League and Football League HQ on August 14. We would encourage all fans to join us.’ With clubs out to maximise revenues to be able to compete in the Premier League within the constraints of Financial Fair Play, fans are once again paying increased prices and 13 sides have raised season-ticket prices this season. The biggest price hikes have been made by Burnley and QPR, both promoted last season — Burnley have raised the price of their cheapest season ticket prices by a whopping 47 per cent. Substantial rises have also been announced at Stoke and Hull. Burnley chief executive Lee Hoos has defended the increases by pointing out that fans able to watch Premier League football this season and because £100 from this year’s season-ticket price will go towards the 2015/16 season tickets when fans renew. Cost of success: Burnley fans will see their prices raised by 37 per cent following promotion . Victors: Despite winning the Premier League, Manchester City have frozen some ticket prices . With the Premier League acknowledged as the most lucrative in the world, only two clubs have lowered prices this season. Football for some fans in the North East has come down in price after Mike Ashley announced marginal price cuts at Newcastle and Sunderland kept their prices down, too. Arsenal have instigated three per cent price rises in line with inflation, taking their most expensive season-ticket prices above the £2,000 mark, the highest in the league. Arsenal also have the most expensive low-cost season ticket, priced at £1,014, which, with the exception of Tottenham and Chelsea, is more costly than every other clubs’ most expensive ticket. Despite winning the league last term, Manchester City have frozen the cost of their cheapest season tickets at £299 — the cheapest in the Premier League — although the club have announced a 10 per cent rise on the most expensive season tickets at the Etihad to £860.","More than 50% of Premier League clubs raise season-ticket prices .

"By . Associated Press . Texas is paying four times more for its execution drugs from a new supplier, putting it in line with a local consumer rate but well below the cost in at least one other death penalty state. The prison agency in the nation's busiest death penalty state paid $13,500 for its most recent batch of pentobarbital at a cost of $1,500 per vial, compared to $350 per dose spent last year, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press under an open records request. The extra cost - a minuscule part of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's $3 billion annual budget - comes after the state's previous supplier refused to provide more of the powerful sedative last year, claiming it had become a target of execution opponents. This May 27, 2008, file photo, shows the gurney in the death chamber in Huntsville, Texas . Prison officials have since found a new compound pharmacy for pentobarbital, and have waged a successful legal battle to keep the business' name secret. Backlash from capital punishment . adversaries has curtailed the number of mainstream drug companies . willing to provide lethal chemical doses to states. But it's not clear . whether the increased cost is tied to that. Industry groups and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration say they do not track prices for the drug . and could not speculate on what factors might have driven the cost up . for Texas. Several other state prison agencies have . refused to release details on their drug purchases and Texas officials . also have declined to comment on details. 'We're confident we're complying with all state and federal laws,' prison spokesman Jason Clark said. The agency's higher cost does not appear extraordinary. A survey of nearly two dozen pharmacies in the Houston area shows Nembutal, the brand name for pentobarbital, sells for about $1,500. The cost is a bargain compared to Missouri, which also uses pentobarbital for executions. Records earlier this year showed state officials paid as much as $8,000 per dose. At least ten inmates have execution dates in the coming months, including two in September, which means Texas' latest batch of pentobarbital is set to run out by the end of the year. The agency has confirmed it will attempt to purchase more drugs, but Clark would not address whether the agency expects costs to rise further or whether it will use the same supplier. The latest drug purchase, in mid-March, was made by the warden at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit, where executions are carried out. It also included an additional $425 for tests to ensure the drugs' potency. Texas and many other death penalty states confronted with execution-drug shortages have turned to compounding pharmacies, which custom-make medications that the FDA considers unapproved and does not verify their safety or effectiveness. But Texas' one-drug protocol has avoided the problems found in Ohio, Arizona and Oklahoma, which all use midazolam as part of a two- or three-drug mixture and had executions go awry in the last year. The records provided to the AP are redacted to conceal references to Texas' new supplier. Just a few years ago, it cost $83.55 in Texas for its former three-drug combination of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride administered to condemned prisoners. But Hospira Inc., the sole U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped production in 2010 and dropped plans to produce it in Italy because the government there asked for guarantees it never would be used in executions. Texas responded by switching to pentobarbital, but Denmark-based Lundbeck Inc., the drug's only U.S.-licensed maker, bowed to pressure from death penalty opponents and announced its medication was off-limits for capital punishment. The Texas prison agency then opted to purchase pentobarbital from The Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy until the Houston-area company refused to provide more drugs in October. The owner wrote a letter to the agency accusing state officials of placing him 'in the middle of a firestorm' of hate mail and potential litigation when his company's name became public. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has supported the prison agency's refusal to publicly name its new supplier, citing a 'threat assessment' signed by Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw that says pharmacies selling execution drugs face 'a substantial threat of physical harm.'","The cost of the execution drug pentobarbital has risen from $350 to $1,500 per vial over the past year in Texas .

"By . Jamie Carragher . When the final whistle sounded and Liverpool's place in the 2005 final of the Champions League was secure, there was only one thing I wanted to do. It wasn't to join the rest of my delirious team-mates, who were dancing in front of the Kop. I didn't even want to run to the part of Anfield where I knew my family and friends would be, even though this was one of the biggest moments of my career. No. The celebrating could wait. My initial thought after that energy-sapping and emotionally draining collision with Chelsea was over was to go and shake hands with John Terry, who - like me - had given every last ounce to try to get his team to Istanbul. VIDEO Scroll down to watch John Terry give one young Chelsea fan a day he'll never forget . Greats do battle: Jamie Carragher and John Terry tussle during the 2005 Champions League semi-final . Captain, leader, legend: Chelsea skipper Terry beats Carragher (right) and Sami Hyypia to the ball . Liverpool and Chelsea had gone toe to toe over two legs and the hallmark of each semi-final was brilliant defending - only one controversial goal separated us at the death. John, of course, was distraught to get so close but I just wanted to tell him how good he had been. We played the game the same way and that night in May 2005 we were like two boxers at the final bell. As Liverpool and Chelsea's rivalry escalated, I remember Rafa Benitez saying to me 'how lucky' Mourinho was to have a player such as Terry. I quickly told him he was lucky to have me and Rafa replied, pulling his hand away from his nose to mimic Pinocchio: 'Yes, yes! You're as good as Terry!' Not to be beaten, I replied with the same gesture: 'Yes, yes! You're as good as Mourinho!' But I could understand what Rafa meant. Terry had this ability to draw the ball to him like a magnet, always getting his head or his foot in the way just when it mattered. John was a better version of me and his form was one of the main reasons I retired from England. Those games took place almost nine years ago but the passing of time has not impacted on the  quality of performance Terry is still producing. If you asked me to select an all-time Premier League XI, he would be the first pick at the heart of my defence. Some outstanding central defenders . have graced the Premier League, such as Rio Ferdinand, Ricardo Carvalho, . Jaap Stam, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell and Vincent Kompany - players with . the medals to match their talent. Terry, however, is the pick of the . bunch. He is the only defender since Paul McGrath in 1993 to be named . PFA Player of the Year and I don't believe it has ever been appreciated . what a consistently outstanding operator he has been. I accept it might be controversial to praise him, given some of the . off-field controversies he has been embroiled in. They have been . dissected at length on these pages. I just feel that the way he is . viewed obscures his playing qualities. Head and shoulders above the rest: Terry beats West Ham's Andy Carroll to an aerial ball . Good Kompany: Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany is one of the Premier League's best defenders . Just . consider this: he was a fixture in the FIFPro Team of the Year at one . stage, selected by his fellow professionals every season from 2005 to . 2009. When you consider the talent that was around during that period, . his consistency was remarkable. Equally remarkable was Chelsea's . 'goals against' column in their first title-winning season of 2004-05. They conceded only 15 in 38 games, a record I do not expect to be . broken. Terry, with . his durability and his quality, was instrumental in driving Mourinho's . men forward. Such attributes continue to serve him well - he is one of . only five outfield players to appear in every minute of the 23 Barclays . Premier League games this season. Centre of attention: Rio Ferdinand (left) and Sol Campbell both had medals to match their talents . Putting his head where it hurts: Tony Adams (left) was the leader of Arsene Wenger's first great Arsenal team . Dutch of class: Jaap Stam was superb at the heart of Manchester United's defence . Ricardo the rock: Carvalho was Terry's partner at Chelsea and was a vital component of their defence . But on Monday night he will be aware that his biggest match of the campaign awaits. Walking out at the Etihad Stadium as a defender must feel like you are heading into the Alamo. Sergio Aguero will be missing, but when he's not causing problems, Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko are, so it will be intriguing to see how Chelsea and Terry try to contain Manchester City. At this moment, a trip to the Etihad is the most daunting challenge for a defender in European football. Arsenal went there with a fine record yet conceded six. Tottenham's goal difference was decimated the day they also got hit for six, while Manchester United were thrashed by four. Leap of faith: Terry (right) shows no sign of declining like some other notable top-flight centre halves . Still up for the challenge: Terry is scrutinised more because he is not very popular away from Stamford Bridge . I still hear John being criticised for a lack of pace but very few centre backs are quick; Terry's reading of the game is outstanding and keeps him out of danger, while his ability on the ball never gets  spoken about; how many defenders in world football can switch the play with their weaker foot? Critics have been quick to write him off, particularly last season when he started only 14 times in the Premier League, but some of what has been said about him is nonsense; as soon as he has a bad game, it gets mentioned that he is over 30 and isn't the same as he was. That's rubbish. Nemanja Vidic and Ferdinand, for instance, have suffered the same injury and form issues yet never get the same level of criticism.  Terry gets such scrutiny because outside Stamford Bridge, he doesn't enjoy any popularity. No going back: Despite his good form, Terry should not return for England . He remains England's best in his position but I don't believe for a minute Roy Hodgson should think about enticing him back to be part of his World Cup squad - there is too much history there. Nor do I think John would be well served ending his international retirement. Clearly he is benefitting from a lesser workload and that will help prolong his career. Chelsea are looking to the future, as their signing of Kurt Zouma shows, but they should offer Terry a new deal, given how he has served them.  And, more importantly, what he can continue to give them. Daniel Sturridge continued his brilliant form in midweek with two goals in a fixture that should cement a Liverpool striker's place in Kop affections. I was at Anfield on Tuesday and, once again, Sturridge made a big impression on me - he is playing with such confidence that you don't expect him to miss when he gets a chance - but, for some reason, I didn't hear his name being sung during the 4-0 win over Everton. It left me wondering: when are Liverpool and England supporters going to start appreciating his exploits? He's scored 27 goals in 34 appearances since he joined Liverpool 12 months ago. That's a phenomenal ratio but it still feels at times that he has question marks hanging over him. No Kop idol: Daniel Sturridge (right) has a brilliant record for Liverpool but seems unloved by the fans . Derby destroyer: Sturridge scored twice on Tuesday as Liverpool beat Everton 4-0 at Anfield . On a bad day, he can look lethargic and when he first joined Liverpool, I wondered whether he would spend a lot of time in the treatment room. But in the past year, he has played regularly and has been one of the top players in the Premier League. Wayne Rooney has been hailed for his excellent form this season and has scored nine goals in 18 Premier League games but Daniel's figures are even better, with 13 goals in 15 league appearances. His consistency in the penalty area has been faultless. If he continues in this vein, Liverpool will have an outstanding chance of finishing in the top four. And if he carries it into the summer, England's hopes at the World Cup will be significantly improved too. 1 KENNY DALGLISH:  Kenny can be razor-sharp with his replies, as was highlighted after a 3-3 draw with Manchester United in 1988. Sir Alex Ferguson was complaining to radio reporters about decisions that had gone against his team. Kenny walked past, holding his baby daughter Lauren, and simply said: 'You'll get more sense out of her than him.' Speaking their mind: Arsene Wenger (left) and Kenny Dalglish have both been partial to the odd amusing quip . 2 ARSENE WENGER: When Ferguson claimed United were the better team in the 2002 title race, Arsenal's boss had this reply: 'Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home.' 3 SIR ALEX FERGUSON: I loved Ferguson's press conferences, as he'd always come out with a jewel. I remember one about Wenger: 'They say he's an intelligent man, right? Speaks five languages. I've got a 15-year-old boy from the Ivory Coast here who speaks five languages!' Jewel: Sir Alex Ferguson was good value in his press conferences as manager of Manchester United . 4 SAM ALLARDYCE: West Ham's manager had his tongue in his cheek when, ahead of a game with Manchester City in 2012, he was asked if he saw himself competing at Champions League level. His reply?  'I won't ever be going to a top-four club because I'm not called Allardici, just Allardyce.' 5 JOSE MOURINHO: This list would not be complete without a quip from the Chelsea manager. This was his reply in 2006 to whether he was feeling pressure in the title race:  'For me, pressure is bird flu; I am feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. I'm more scared of bird flu than football.' That's handy: Sam Allardyce (left) and Jose Mourinho after West Ham's visit to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday .","John Terry was a better version of me and his form was one of the main reasons I retired from international football .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Extremist videos which help to radicalise impressionable young men are to be blocked from the internet in the UK. The Home Office is in talks with web companies to refuse access to violent films hosted overseas 'at a network level', MailOnline can reveal. The plans for what will effectively be ‘cyber border controls’ have been drawn up by James Brokenshire, promoted to immigration minister at the weekend. Banned: Ministers want to be able to block anyone in the UK from accessing videos which help to radicalise impressionable young men . Ministers have been spurred into action by the growing threat from jihadists in Syria. Around 2,000 Europeans are thought to be fighting in Syria, including at least 200 known to the British security services. It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad. Anti-terror police and the Crown Prosecution Service can currently demand that vile videos posted on UK websites be removed. Since February 2010, the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) has taken down more than 21,000 pieces of illegal terrorist online content. If the CTIRU and prosecutors deem material to be illegal it can be blocked from parts of the public sector, including schools and hospitals but this does not extend to domestic users and filters can be turned off. Home Office minister James Brokenshire wants to further restrict access to material which is hosted overseas . It has also been difficult to act against sites hosted abroad, both in the Middle East and in the US where sites plead the Fifth Amendment which protects freedom of speech. The Extremism Taskforce is examining how to further restrict access to illegal content hosted overseas, which would be much more effective in ensuring people in the UK were unable to access it. If videos, photographs and texts is found to be illegal under the Terrorism Act, but hosted overseas, the security agencies will act to restrict access to it. Mr Brokenshire, who became immigration minister on Saturday following the resignation of Mark Harper, said the new controls could also be used to block access to sick child pornography. He told MailOnline: ‘Terrorist propaganda online has a direct impact on the radicalisation of individuals and we work closely with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to remove terrorist material hosted in the UK or overseas. ‘Through proposals from the Extremism Taskforce announced by the Prime Minister in November, we will look to further restrict access to material which is hosted overseas - but illegal under UK law - and help identify other harmful content to be included in family-friendly filters.’ However, Emma Carr, deputy director of Big Brother . Watch, was unhappy at the move. She said: 'Politicians and civil servants should not be deciding . what we can see online. 'If content is to be blocked then it should be a court deciding that it is necessary and proportionate to do so. 'As . people riot on the streets of Turkey over freedom of speech online and . Government censorship this issue must be handled in a way that cannot be . exploited by oppressive regimes around the world.' Search engines like Google and Yahoo came under fire last year for not doing more to shut down hate-filled sites in the wake of the Woolwich attack on Drummer Lee Rigby. Thousands of videos which help to radicalise impressionable young men are easily available on YouTube. Today a search for beheadings on YouTube, which is owned by Google, brought up 129,000 results. In October, Facebook bowed to pressure from David Cameron and child internet protection campaigners by taking down a graphic video of a woman being beheaded in Mexico. Threat: The government fears Britain could become vulnerable to a terror attack from fighters returning from fighting in Syria . The Prime Minister had accused Facebook of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents. Critics accused the firm of ‘taking leave of its senses’. Facebook had said that while the images must not be posted for ‘sadistic pleasure’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them. The Home Office also wants to make it easier for people to report extremist content online. Officials are working with industry to ‘help them identify harmful extremist content to include in family-friendly filters’.","Home Office in talks with to block violent videos 'at a network level'

"By . Sarah Michael For Daily Mail Australia . The birth mother of baby Gammy has gone to Bangkok to escape the intense media attention that has come with being the face of an international surrogacy row. Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, is in the Thai capital getting advice on how to handle the reaction to news reports suggesting she solicited other women to be egg donors, according to Hands Across The Water - the charity taking care of the family's medical expenses. Ms Pattaramon, who has been taking care of Gammy after he was abandoned by his Australian parents when they allegedly discovered he had Down syndrome, has been seeking advice from the Thai Rat newspaper on how to handle negative publicity. 'The reason she is in Bangkok right now is to deal with issues,' charity spokesman Nom Manochantr told Daily Mail Australia via a translator from Samitivej Sriracha Hospital, where Gammy is receiving treatment.

'Right now the story is going in a negative direction. She will have to be careful.' Mr Manochantr was in Chon Buri, 80km south of Bangkok, to pay money for Ms Pattaramon's grandparents to stay in the private hospital, where they are minding Gammy while she is in Bangkok. He said Ms Pattaramon's two eldest children were also in the hospital but declined to comment about whether her husband had accompanied her to Bangkok.

Hands Across The Water has been accepting donations on behalf of Gammy ever since the story of his alleged abandonment by Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell started receiving international media coverage. The charity also facilitated his move from a local hospital to the private hospital where he is currently receiving treatment. So far, $239,688 has been raised to help support the baby's development. Hands Across The Water says every cent will go to Gammy. Mr Manochantr said the charity and Ms Pattaramon had agreed she will not receive the money in a lump sum, and they will instead make a long-term plan for the money. He added that when Gammy is released from hospital, which is likely to be early next week, he and Ms Pattaramon will go stay with a home stay family instead of returning to their home.

He also said her grandparents would continue to live in their home in an industrial area in Chon Buri where they run a food stall serving Thai salads. Mr Manochantr said the director of Samitivej Sriracha Hospital, Noppadol Noppakun, has offered to be to facilitate all of Gammy's medical treatment in the future. He added that the family had received medical treatment at a discounted rate. 'He is a good man,' Mr Manochantr said. Two bicycles sit at the unit complex where Ms Pattaramon rents with her husband for 2,200 baht per month, which equates to $74, in Chon Buri . Photos from inside the hospital where Gammy is staying have been posted on her Facebook page . Mr Manochantr said Hands Across The Water director Peter Baines first contacted Ms Pattaramon when Gammy was admitted to the smaller, government-run hospital nearby in Sriracha. They made the decision to move to the private hospital because it would provide better treatment, but also because the government-run hospital would not allow press access. 'She was planning to talk media and knew it would be too difficult in the other hospital,' Mr Manochantr said. Mr Manochantr also said he did not believe the negative stories about Ms Pattaramon, and added they would have no impact on the charity's involvement. 'That is a separate issue, we are focussed on Gammy,' he said. Hands Across The Water plans to support Gammy until he completes education, Mr Manochantr said. Ms Pattaramon's Facebook page is littered with photos of Gammy (left) and her husband (right) Ms Pattaramon grew up at her grandparent's home and the family has been living there for about 20 years .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . and Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . Baby Gammy's Australian biological parents have revealed that they were hiding inside their Western Australia home all week, while the media camped on their door step. David and Wendy Farnell did not shower or turn on the computer to ensure no one found out that they were hidden inside. They remained undetected on the two occasions child protection officers came to the Bunbury home to speak with the parents, news.com.au reports. The couple have been sought by the Western Australian Department of Child Protection, who wish to assess the Farnells suitability as parents since it was revealed that David Farnell, 56, is a convicted paedophile. Scroll down for video . David and Wendy Farnell, the biological parents of abandoned baby Gammy, will speak on 60 minutes on Sunday night. David and Wendy Farnell, the parents at the centre of the surrogacy scandal, will speak for the first time about the events surrounding the birth of their twins . The Farnells also refused to come to the door when the RSPCA took the family dog away, believing the couple had left their home and abandoned their pet. The couple say they fed their dog everyday before it was taken away on Tuesday. It is understood the Farnells have contacted the department this week. The Australian parents of baby Gammy left their home at midnight on Wednesday. On Thursday night, they filmed an interview with 60 minutes, pleading with Australians to 'hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them'. 60 Minutes will make a donation to the charity Hands Across The Water, but the couple were not paid for the interview. The couple will speak to 60 Minutes on Sunday night and have asked Australians to 'hear their side of the story' before they judge them . Hands Across The Water have already raised more than $200,000 for Gammy's treatment and care. They will support Gammy until he has completed his education. David and Wendy Farnell, who are at the centre of the surrogacy scandal that has gripped the country, will speak to 60 Minutes this Sunday about the events surrounding the birth of their twins via a surrogate mother in Thailand earlier this year. A preview of episode shows Mr Farnell explaining, 'We wanted to bring him with us.' In the late 1990s, Farnell was convicted of 22 child sex offences, committed while he was in his 20s, including one against a girl who was just seven. The sentencing judge said the victims had been 'robbed of their childhood'. Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10. It was not until the women were adults that they made complaints and court documents said the women had suffered 'depression' and 'difficulty forming relationships' as a result of the abuse. But the couple, who will be interviewed on 60 Minutes on Sunday, spoke through the television program to ask 'Australia to hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them.' Meanwhile Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, declined to give an interview with the program, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 'I don't want money from them,' she said. 'I don't need their help.' David Farnell, 56, was convicted of 22 counts of child sex offences in the late 1990s . The couple's interview will come just days after one of Mr Farnell's adult children – a son from his previous marriage – spoke out in defence of his father, saying that the family had not been able to tell their side of the story for legal reasons. Also on Thursday, the son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, telling the Sydney Morning Herald that it was 'heartbreaking' his father's dark past was being revisited. 'He's taken 10 years to get his life back on track and he did and he has done so well and this, this has been shattering,' the unnamed son was quoted as saying. Ms Pattaramon claims the Farnells, from Bunbury in Western Australia, did not want seven-month-old baby Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome and took only his twin sister. The Farnells initially claimed their daughter, whom they admitted was the same age as Gammy and had been born through a Thai surrogate, did not have a twin brother. They later said they had known about the twin, but were told he only had a day to live and should say their goodbyes to the baby before they left the country, due to civil unrest. Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, says the Farnells did not want Gammy and told her to have an abortion, when they discovered he had Down syndrome . Chanbua smothered him with kisses while he was in hospital getting treatment for a lung infection . The couple also wanted to make it known that they have been cooperating with the Department of Child Protection since Wednesday morning and will continue to cooperate with them. They also wanted it to be known that they had been feeding their dog every day until the RSPCA took her away on Wednesday morning. Officers from the Department of Child Protection were seen visiting the Farnells' South Bunbury home on Wednesday. The Farnells wanted to make it known that they had been cooperating with the DoCP since that time .

A C130 cargo plane had been due to make a second drop of UK aid on the slopes of the Iraqi mountain where tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians are trapped in appalling conditions. But despite making several passes, the Hercules could not find a clear space to parachute aid bundles down without risking injury to those below. Scroll down for video . Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community gather for humanitarian aid at the Iraq-Syria border at Feeshkhabour border point on Sunday . Thousands are still trapped on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq after fleeing the advance of Islamic State militants.

Some . 20,000 are said to have been led off the mountain in the past 48 hours, . many making their way to the Kurdish city of Irbil where the 1.5million . population has grown by around 185,000. There . were heartbreaking scenes yesterday as thousands who had been trapped . on the mountain, or who had fled into neighbouring Syria, tried to reach . safety in Kurdish areas across a pontoon bridge. People . scanned every vehicle for loved ones. Unknown numbers of men, women and . children went missing in the chaos as panicked Yazidis fled militants. Others . were lost as families scattered under gunfire from extremists chasing . them into the mountains. Dizzy from thirst, adults lost track of . children in the crowds on Mount Sinjar. Some . women were abducted by Islamic State militants, and Iraqi and US . officials say they believe hundreds are being held captive. ‘There are many missing, many,’ said Naji Khano, who lost his son Sherwan, 17, as he fled gunmen.

Many spoke of the dead they had left behind, some shot by . militants, others dead from starvation or dehydration on the mountain. ‘My sister is missing,’ 22-year-old Amer Qassem said. He . and dozens of his extended family fled their village of Tel Qassab on . the night of August 2 when they heard Islamic State fighters were . approaching. UK . aid was dropped on northern Iraq on Saturday, but a second attempt had . to be abandoned early this morning amid fears for the safety of the . crowd of refugees below .

"By . Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . and Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . Disgraced former NRL star Todd Carney says he doesn't understand the criticism or controversy after a photo was leaked last month of Carney partying with the notorious Corby sisters at a Balinese bar. In the wake of his shameful dismissal from the Cronulla Sharks, the photograph put the 28-year-old back in the press for all the wrong reasons - but Carney can't grasp why. Speaking for the first time since the controversy, Carney says, 'I'm not ashamed,' according to the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH). 'Someone asked me to pose for a photo... If people are kind or decent to me and ask for a photo I'm not about to be rude to them.  I'm not ashamed to appear in a photo with them... I don't see the big issue or the interest in the picture.' Trio: Todd was photographed partying with Schapelle Corby who was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago, and her sister Mercedes last week . In the snap, the sacked Cronulla Sharks player has his tattooed arms draped over the sisters' shoulders and a big smile on his face. The photo was leaked to the media from a private social media account - and Carney believes that the picture came from the Facebook page of a mortified Mercedes Corby. 'I saw (Mercedes) the day after it hit the headlines and she was very apologetic. I don't hold it against her. She didn't do this to me,' Carney tells SMH. Corby, 37, was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of cannabis to Indonesia. And 29-year-old Carney has escaped Australia after his 'bubbling' scandal, which showed the sportsman urinating into his own mouth in a lewd photograph taken in a hotel toilet. 'Toddy and me post bubble!': A fan posted photos of himself with Todd Carney on Instagram during a night out at Alleycats bar in Katu, Bali. Bryson McNeill said Carney asked him what he did and brushed off his own troubles . Schapelle Corby is on parole after being released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison in February this year. This photo shows her in 2005 before her trial for drug smuggling . The 'bubbling' photo was and leaked on social media and led to him being sacked from his team. Corby lives with her sister in Kuta, Bali, where Carney is currently holidaying. Just three months after being released from jail she got back together with her Indonesian boyfriend Ben Panangian, who supported her while she was locked-up. It's believed she now works at her sister's surfboard and swimwear shop on the island. On 16 July, Carney first graced his social media accounts since his spectacular exit from the sport. He was all smiles with former Cronulla Sharks teammate Wade Graham, as the pair caught up mid-week for a sweet treat. He captioned a photo: 'Always good company and laugh with this frick @wadegraham17 #waffles #yogurberry,' Schapelle Corby is still living in Bali with her sister and boyfriend Ben Panangian. Here she is seen with Ben in front of the Board Room Surfing shop that belongs to her sister Mercedes . All smiles: Sacked NRL star Todd Carney has graced his social media accounts for the first time since his spectacular exit from the sport last month, with teammate Wade Graham . Fans were supportive of Carney's return to social media, sending him well wishes, with one saying: 'Good on ya @tcarney86 bounce back bigger and better,' while another posed the question on everyone's lips: 'What are u going to do now after that thing u did @tcarney86.' Carney's sacking followed years of controversy including run-ins with police and NRL officials. In 2009, a full-frontal naked photo of Carney appeared on a rental phone in Canberra. The telephone company apologised after a woman found the images on a phone she was loaned by a Telstra Shop while her handset was being repaired. Career breaker: Todd cut a far different figure to that when he hit the headlines more than a month ago amidst his 'bubbling' scandal . In 2006, while playing with the Canberra Raiders, he was charged with drink driving and lost his license for five years. He was later caught driving while disqualified and failed to stop for police, which resulted in his being sentenced to community service. He allegedly urinated on a man in a Canberra nightclub in 2008. Later that year he was de-registered and banned from playing in the NRL competition until 2010 due to his on-going string of alcohol-related incidents.

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . The same federal scientist who recently found forgotten samples of . smallpox at a federal lab also uncovered over 300 additional vials, many . bearing the names of highly contagious viruses and bacteria. Food . and Drug Administration officials said Wednesday the undocumented . collection contained 327 carefully packaged vials, listing pathogens . like dengue, influenza and rickettsia. Last week the government only . disclosed that it had recovered six glass vials of smallpox dating from . the 1950s. Forgotten: Forgotten viles of various diseases and bacterias have been discovered in storage at the National Institute of Health . The new revelations raise serious concerns about the . government's ability to secure its collections of potentially deadly . pathogens. 'The reasons why these samples went unnoticed for this . long is something we're actively trying to understand,' said FDA deputy . director for biologics Dr. Peter Marks. The samples, including . those labeled smallpox, were found in 12 boxes in a corner of a cold . storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, . that has been used by the Food and Drug Administration since 1972. FDA . officials estimate the collection was assembled between 1946 and 1964 by . government scientists. 'The fact that these materials were not . discovered until now is unacceptable,' said Karen Midthun, of FDA's . director for biologics. 'However, upon finding these materials our staff . did the right thing — they immediately notified the appropriate . authorities who secured the materials and determined there was no . exposure.' Smallpox: This 1975 file electronmicrograph from the Centers for Disease Control shows the smallpox virus . FDA scientists said they have not yet confirmed . whether the newly disclosed vials actually contained the pathogens . listed on their labels. The agency is conducting a nationwide search of . all cold storage units for any other missing samples. Investigators . destroyed 32 vials containing tissue samples and a non-contagious virus . related to smallpox. Several unlabeled vials were sent to the Centers . for Disease Control and Prevention for testing and the remaining 279 . samples were shipped to the Department of Homeland Security for . safekeeping. FDA officials said there is no evidence anyone was exposed . to any of the agents, which were packed in heat-sealed glass vials with . no signs of leakage. The finding of freeze-dried smallpox samples . was disturbing because smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and . world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely . stored in super-secure laboratories in Atlanta and in Russia. Investigation: The CDC, pictured, and the FBI are investigating the six vials of smallpox found in a storage room . It . was the second recent incident in which a U.S. government health agency . appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous biologic agent. Last . month, scores of employees at the CDC in Atlanta were feared exposed to . anthrax because of a laboratory safety lapse. The CDC began giving them . antibiotics as a precaution. In separate congressional testimony . Wednesday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden acknowledged that systemic . safety problems have for years plagued federal public health . laboratories that handle dangerous germs such as anthrax and bird flu. Frieden added that his agency had long thought of the lapses as . unrelated accidents.","The freeze-dried samples were .

"By . Reuters . and Ap . More than 11 million U.S. viewers tuned in to watch the United States beat Ghana during a World Cup soccer match on Monday, setting a new record for soccer viewership on ESPN, according to Nielsen. The game was the highest-rated men's soccer match for the sports cable network. The game also set a record at Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast network, attracting 4.8 million people, which made it the most-viewed U.S. World Cup match in the network's history. While record-setting for the individual networks, the 16million total viewership is down from the 17.3 million who saw the first U.S. match in the 2010 tournament, against England, which was shown on ABC and Univision on a Saturday afternoon. Record-setting: Team USA supporters in Michigan celebrate as their team ended an 8-year losing streak against Ghana on Monday as more viewers watched ESPN's broadcast of the sport than ever before . Four years ago, 19.7 million people watched the U.S.-Ghana match in the knockout round, which ended the United States' run in the tournament and was also shown on ABC and Univision on a Saturday afternoon. ESPN says an additional 469,000 watched a digital stream of this year's match, a usage record for its WatchESPN app. Comparable Univision numbers were not immediately available. There's a strong likelihood viewership for the next two U.S. games will eclipse the 2010 tournament, in part because the time zones in Brazil are close to those in the U.S. Games four years ago with Slovenia and Algeria, shown on ESPN and Univision in the morning hours, reached 7.5 million and 8.7 million. Through 14 games, World Cup action on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC has averaged 4.11 million viewers, up from 3.35 million at the same juncture in 2010, Nielsen said. ESPN's streaming viewership is up 170 percent over the last World Cup. Everyone wins: Fans of the U.S. team in Rio de Janeiro celebrate Monday's win. Spanish language channel Univision is also celebrating after it saw more soccer viewers than ever before as well, with 4.8million . Nielsen does not measure people who watch the games at work or in bars. The U.S.-Ghana game was the most viewed program on ESPN since Jan. 6, when college football's BCS National Championship pulled in 26.6 million viewers. On Monday, the U.S. beat Ghana by a score of 2-1, snapping an eight-year losing streak against the West African country. The United States next plays on Sunday when they take on Portugal in the Amazon city of Manaus. While the sport of soccer has been gaining ground in the United States, it is still does not reach the level of television viewership for some other sports. For example, the National Football League's annual Super Bowl drew in more than 111 million U.S. viewers this year. Brad Adgate, senior vice president at Horizon Media, said the number of people watching the U.S.-Ghana match in the United States for both networks was probably higher given the throngs that flocked to bars and restaurants. 'It's a respectable number,' Adgate said about the number of viewers. 'It's growing in the right direction.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . In a recitation of death and destruction, a federal prosecutor on Tuesday chronicled for a jury the alleged conduct of four Blackwater security guards accused of killing 14 Iraqis and wounding 18 others in downtown Baghdad nearly seven years ago. In opening statements at the trial of the four guards, Assistant U.S. Attorney T. Patrick Martin said some of the victims were 'simply trying to get out' of the way of gunfire from Blackwater guards. 'Fourteen died, 18 injured. For what?' he said. 'Killers': Former Blackwater security guards Evan Liberty (top left), Dustin Heard (top right), Nick Slatten (bottom right) and Paul Slough (bottom left) have been charged in the deaths of 14 Iraqis . One component of the prosecutors' case is that the Blackwater guards harbored deep hostility toward Iraqis and boasted of indiscriminate firing of their weapons. Immediately after the shootings at Nisoor Square on Sept. 16, 2007, as soon as the guards got back to their base, they participated in a lie that there were insurgents in the area, said Martin . 'That lie that they had begun that day would unravel within moments' because two veteran Army officers showed up on the scene to see what was going on, he said. One of the guards, Nicholas Slatten, is accused of first-degree murder. The other three — Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard — are on trial for voluntary manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and gun charges. In the aftermath of the shootings, Liberty was slapping people on the back, just as at a football game, Martin said. The guards pleaded innocent to all charges. Massacre: An Iraqi police officer inspects a vehicle destroyed by the Blackwater guards in the alleged attacks . On Tuesday, Martin displayed graphic photos and video of the scene in the Iraqi capital, including a picture said to be the face of a motorist prosecutors said had been shot in the head. The victim was identified by the prosecution as the first victim to be killed in the shootings, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y. Slatten is charged with first-degree murder in his death. On Monday, in a preview of the photos and video, lawyers for the security guards had argued that it was unfair to the defendants to show the jury the photograph the prosecution said was of Al Rubia'y. They said the picture was meaningless without testimony from a doctor or a forensics expert. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the photo alone was evidence that could be shown to the jury. But Lamberth ruled out another photo showing brain matter on the street and blood spatters on a car window. On Monday Slatten's lawyer, Thomas Connolly, said it was 'pure imagination' that the photo of the car driver amounts to evidence of Slatten firing the shot that killed the driver. 'I can't divine anything from that aside from body mass and charred remains,' Connolly said. In addition to allegedly killing 14 people, the Blackwater guards are accused of wounding 18 others during the 2007 attack . Lawyers for the Blackwater defendants are focusing on self-defense and state of mind in a war zone to explain their clients' actions. One expert witness they plan to call would testify about the use of force in combat situations and the general threat level in Baghdad at the time of the shootings. Another expert witness will testify that certainty or absolute proof that a perceived threat was deadly or imminent was not required in order for a contractor to respond with deadly force. Rather, an individual would need only a reasonable perception, based on all the circumstances of which he was aware. Slatten could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. The other guards face a mandatory minimum penalty of 30 years in prison if they are convicted of the gun charge and at least one other charge.","Three of the guards, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard, face manslaughter charges, while another, Nicholas Slatten, has been charged with murder .

"By . Pete D'amato . New York Giants running back David Wilson is walking away from his childhood dream after being told by doctors he 'should not play football any more' due to the risk of a serious injury posed by a spinal condition. NBC Sports reports that on Monday the Giants placed Wilson on waivers as 'injured' when the third-year tailback received a grave diagnosis after an injury in practice that left him numb in the arms and legs. Wilson says in a statement . released by the team, 'I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me, or pity . me.' Goodbye glory: David Wilson walks off the field one last time in a New York Giants uniform after a neck injury forced him out of practice . Onward: David Wilson posted to Instagram about how his dream as an kid was to play in the NFL and closed by saying 'Once a Giant always a #Giant' 'I lived my dream. A lot of people only get to dream their dream. I lived that dream. Now I have a chance to dream another dream and live that, too.' Wilson posted a drawing on Instagram with a caption that read, 'At age 8 I told my #Dad I wanted to play football in THE NFL at this point in my life I have done that.' 'Once a Giant, always a #Giant,' he finished. The Giants drafted Wilson in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft after a bright college career at Virginia Tech, where Wilson was named ACC Offensive Player of the Year in 2011. Early fumbling problems aside, Wilson finished his rookie season with the Giants with 1,925 all-purpose yards, establishing himself as a formidable rusher, receiver and special teams player. In 2013, Wilson landed on injured reserve for the season after an injury he suffered in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles in week 5. Giants doctors examined him at the time and diagnosed a condition known as 'spinal stenosis,' where the space inside the spinal column contracts. Wilson underwent spinal surgery in January and it wasn't until last month that doctors cleared him for full contact in practice, according to ESPN. Downhill: David Wilson shows his promise during the preseason of his rookie year in a photo posted to Instagram . But only a week later, Wilson suffered a 'neck burner' after colliding with guard Eric Herman in practice, said the New York Post. Wilson was sidelined with numbness in his extremities and missed the Giants' preseason opener against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. In a eulogy to David Wilson's career, the New York Times quotes Jene Bramel, a pediatrician who blogs about football injuries, that Wilson risked 'paralysis and quadriplegia' if he suffered damage to the spinal cord, and that in a weakened condition his spine might not be able to protect from these injuries. Giants coach Tom Coughlin, who spoke with Wilson on Monday, called his attitude a 'great lesson for all of us.' 'Nothing that was said got him to a state of melancholy,' Coughlin told reporters by teleconference 'There's a lot to be said about his inner strength right now.'","Wilson says he doesn't 'want anybody to feel sorry for me, or pity me'

The FBI has been involved in the case since 2000 but as there were few leads the trail went cold, Fox News reports.

'In addition to the current . fugitives, I had a stack of old cases, and Stammer’s stood out,' he wrote in a statement at the FBI site. Concurrently, a Diplomatic Security Service agent had begun testing facial recognition software to spot passport fraud, and used that software on Stammer's wanted poster to see if it would match any passport photos on file. This led them to discover the fugitive was actually teaching English in Nepal, where he was known as Kevin Hodges.

"By . Associated Press . and Pete D'amato . A teary jury convicted a New York City parolee of murder, bringing closure to the family and friends of slain Nassau County police officer Arthur Lopez, 29. Darrell Fuller, 34, was pronounced guilty of first- and second-degree murder, robbery and weapons charges for an October 2012 killing spree that also claimed the life of Raymond Facey near Belmont Park racetrack on Long Island. The New York Post reported that Lopez had approached Fuller's car at a Mobil station on Long Island after watching Fuller speed away from the scene of an accident on at least one flat tire. Brought to justice: Cop-killer Darrell Fuller after arrest in 2012 . Gunned down: Darrell Fuller shot Nassau County cop Arthur Lopez (L) before killing Raymond Facey (R) After a 'short exchange' at the driver's side window, Fuller burst from the car and fired what would be a fatal round into Lopez's chest. Fuller escaped as Lopez's patrol partner, Clarence Hudson, attempted to aid Lopez, who was not wearing a bulletproof vest. Lopez was later pronounced dead at the hospital. 'This was a police officer that was a building block of this police department, the future of this police department,' Police Benevolent Association president James Carver said after the trial. 'That is what his life was all about was helping the public,' he added. There Fuller attacked Raymond Facey, 52, who was parked on the shoulder talking on cellphone with his daughter. The family heard Fuller pull Facey, a grandfather and father of four, out of his Toyota and shoot him once in the head, leaving his body on the side of the road.

One of Facey's twin daughters, Abbigail Jones, 23, told reporters outside the courthouse, 'We can't bring Daddy back, but this is such a blessing that we know who did it.' 'We know we got the right person.' After the spree, Fuller fled to Queens, eventually ditching Facey's car before being arrested hours later. Authorities said he first went to a nearby day care center, where he called a friend to pick him up. According to prosecutors, that friend later shot Fuller in an attempt to make it appear that Fuller had been a victim of the carnage. Fuller served four years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted murder in 2005, authorities said. He was jailed again in 2010 after violating his parole on a drug arrest and was released in 2011, prosecutors said. The trial extended over seven weeks and testimony was limited to three days a week because Fuller needed the other two days to receive kidney dialysis treatments.

The 113-acre park, home to 190 species of bird, has been likened to a 'war-zone' after the group ripped out park benches and dumped a 60-ton mountain of rubbish upon being asked to leave on Friday. Littered among the sprawling heap of abandoned goods at Chase Nature Reserve in Dagenham, east London, were fridges, sofas, gas cylinders and even an exercise bike. Scroll down for video . Chaos: The fly-tipping travellers left a trail of devastation in their wake after being evicted from Chase Nature Reserve in Dagenham last Friday . The group had been illegally camping in the park in east London - pictured among the sprawling heap of rubbish are sofas, cabinets and fridges . Piles of wood, cardboard, loose metal and other household appliances can also be seen among the waste tip. The appalling mess was discovered by local businessman, Peter Harris, 43, as he jogged through the park on Sunday. Mr Harris, the UKIP parliamentary candidate for Dagenham & Rainham, said: 'The tip was simply unbelievable. 'It was a cross between a war-zone and Frizlands Lane recycling depot in Dagenham. The wildlife we have over there is fantastic so this is just terrible. 'I call the park Dagenham's best-kept secret and for this to happen to such a beautiful place is an absolute disgrace.' Mr Harris claims some of the park's regular visitors even broke down in tears at the sheer scale of the mess. It is thought that up to 30 tonnes of garbage have already been removed as part of the massive clean-up operation - expected to take up to a week. Serene: The reserve, which is home to 190 species of bird and several rare black poplar trees, is usually a place of beauty and is popular with wildlife lovers .

I've never seen the park in such a state as it is now.' Steve Drake, founder of Friends of The Chase, who look after the park, said: 'A lot of tidying up will have to be done to restore the reserve to how it was.' Almost 200 types of bird live in the special retreat - including kingfishers, skylarks and several birds of prey - and there have also been recent sightings of the rare great snipe, pine bunting and spotted crake. The reserve forms part of the 207-acre Eastbrookend Country Park, which was created out of derelict land and opened in 1995 in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. Rated as one of the best urban nature centres in the south-east of England, Chase Nature Reserve also boasts six black poplar trees, only 600 of which remain in the UK.

A search is now on for the animal which authorities say must be put down as it has proven itself a danger. Andrea Reese, 20, of Uniontown, Ohio, was bitten by an alligator without provocation Thursday during a canoe trip in Florida . Authorities say that although the attack appears to have been without cause they must now euthanize the alligator (not pictured) The Tampa Bay Times reports the woman had no food, small animals, or anything else that could attract an alligator. She sustained bites to her left thigh and calf. One other woman in the canoe, Morgan Fusselman, 20, was not injured. The women rented the canoe from Canoe Escape on the 23-acre park of Lower Hillsborough Wilderness Preserve and had been boating about 45 minutes downriver when the attack occurred. 'It's the last thing you want to hear. You know it's a possibility, . but the probability is just not there,' Canoe Escape manager Michael Cole told The Tampa Bay Times. 'But in the outdoors, . anything is possible and freakish accidents can occur.'

"By . Jack Crone For Mailonline . For most people, the prospect of eating Christmas dinner while holed up in the garden shed would not be an enticing one. But for John Siggins, 62, the experience last year was one of luxury after he transformed his lean-to into a precise imitation of the dining room found on the Titanic. The railway engineer, from Ripley, Derbyshire, has spent up to £10,000 turning the tiny structure into a replica of the lavish room - made famous in the 1997 film about the doomed ship. John Siggins, 62,  is so pleased with his replica of the Titanic's dining room that he even ate his Christmas dinner in there last year . The railway engineer, from Ripley, Derbyshire, has spent thousands turning the tiny structure into an exact copy of the lavish room - made famous in 1997 film Titanic . He has claimed that his creation could be worth ten times that to the right collector. The corrugated-iron shed features wooden panels, chairs and dining sets from the ship's sister liner, the Olympic - all of which Mr Siggins has collected over 25 years. Assembled completely by hand, the idea for the project first came about after he was gifted an original blanket handed to a rescued passenger when the ship sunk in 1912. Mr Siggins was at a library researching a family who had been on the Titanic when an elderly man sitting next to him recognised the name of a survivor he was reading about - Julia Cavendish. The same name was printed on an old blanket that the man unwittingly had at home - which he had acquired through inheritance. As soon as the man mentioned the link, Mr Siggins offered to buy the blanket. Speaking about the various trinkets he has collected over the years, he said 'It's history - I buy it all because it's close to my heart . Mr Siggins said: 'He said I could have it. He told me he wasn't bothered about money and that I would make more use of it than he would.' The blanket was heavily stained and in a state of disrepair but has since been professionally cleaned. He added: 'It is the main thing that got me going on the project. I had always enjoyed collecting but this was the thing that made me want to build the shed properly.' Speaking about the various trinkets he has collected over the years, he said: 'It's history. I buy it all because it's close to my heart and this is how I want to see it. 'When I get all of the building sorted I want to start an archive - that's my aim and my ambition.' Mr Siggins has spent thousands of pounds renovating the lean-to (pictured left) after being inspired by the gift of a blanket (right) which was originally given to a survivor of the Titanic upon being rescued . Mr Siggins has since researched the story of Julia Cavendish - the woman who first owned the blanket. She had been married to Tyrell Cavendish - nephew of Emily Mundy of Markeaton Hall - who died when the ship sank in 1912. Mrs Cavendish had been one of the lucky ones to get a space on a lifeboat and was ultimately rescued by the crew of the RMS Carpathia. Many of the items found in the renovated shed have come from the Titanic's sister liner, the Olympic . People were given blankets to prevent and combat hypothermia and Mrs Cavendish kept this with her for the rest of her life. After she died, her blanket was inherited by the anonymous man who John met in the library. Unaware of its significance, he was close to throwing the blanket away before John offered to buy it.

One viewer, 'sam1pm', wrote on Twitter: 'A little insensitive to play a family guy that bags Robin Williams today.' 'number0six' added: 'Poor form @7Mate_TV airing family guy where they have a dig at Robin Williams?' Others were left confused. 'Jono5785' tweeted: '7mate showing a Family Guy episode with a payout reference to Robin Williams. Coincidence or deliberate? Weird...' 'auspanda' provided the broadcaster with some advice: 'hmm someone at @7Mate_TV probably could have rescheduled the ep of family guy with the robin williams gag in it.....' A Seven spokesperson told Mumbrella: 'It was a coincidence'. Daily Mail Australia has approached the network for comment. But Seven was not alone in its unfortunate timing. The BBC in the United Kingdom coincidentally broadcast the 'Viewer Mail #2' episode which featured Williams - and suicide - just as news broke about Williams' death. A BBC spokesman said: 'This was a repeat that we have shown a couple of times before, so who could have planned that?' ‘It was scheduled more than two weeks ago so it is just an uncanny coincidence. Some of our people who work here noticed that the death of Robin Williams was announced just as this episode ended.’ ‘It was due to be repeated on Friday but we will not be showing it now.’ Listing: A BBC spokesman said yesterday that the broadcast of the episode was an 'uncanny coincidence', but confirmed that a scheduled repeat of it for Friday will now not be shown .

Seth MacFarlane, 40, who voices Peter, said on Twitter yesterday: ‘The world just got a lot less funny. Robin Williams is a tragic loss.’ His post was retweeted more than 10,000 times. Channel 4 News has apologised after airing a clip of Williams in Good Morning Vietnam saying: ‘Get a rope and hang me’. The programme broadcast a report about his death last night which included a clip from the 1987 film that saw him play an unorthodox DJ on US Armed Services Radio in Vietnam. The use of his quote in the clip was criticised by viewers on Twitter. Voiceover artist Trish Bertram said: ‘Slightly unfortunate choice of Robin William's Good Morning Vietnam clip by Channel 4 News for their closing tribute’. The tribute was altered when rebroadcasted on Channel 4+1 later, reported The Guardian. A spokesman said: ‘We'd like to apologise for including what was an inappropriate line from Good Morning Vietnam in our play-out from tonight's programme. There was no offence intended in what was meant to be a heartfelt tribute to Robin Williams.’ British viewers reacted in shock to the coincidence. Joe Longy tweeted: ‘So weird that the Family Guy episode about Robin Williams was on last night just before it was announced he was dead.’ And Francesca Parman said: 'Did anyone else watch the Robin Williams family guy last night? How coincidentally strange.' Viewer Mail #2 is from season ten of the popular comedy, which looks at the life of an American family and is regularly shown on BBC Three. Williams, 63, was last seen alive by his wife Susan Schneider on Sunday night before she went to bed. He was found hanged in California at 11.45am local time on Monday. The actor shot to fame in the late 1970s as an alien in the US TV comedy series Mork & Mindy. But it was his role as an irreverent DJ with the US Armed Services Radio station in Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987 which won him huge acclaim. His roles ranged from serious and dramatic in films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, to comedy in Mrs Doubtfire. He was nominated for an Oscar three times before winning an Academy Award for his performance as a psychologist in Good Will Hunting in 1997.","Social media users fire up over 7Mate's broadcast of old Family Guy episode poking fun at Robin Williams .

It shows the girl being floored after one of the girl's takes a swing at her, before she has punches rained down on top of her. Scroll down for video . The mobile phone footage shows the girl being knocked to the floor before she pinned to the ground . The 17-year-old victim then has punches rained down on top of her by her attackers . She appears to then be dragged along the floor by her hair before the two girls take it in turns to kick the victim as she lies on the ground. The two girls then stop their attack before the teenage victim is eventually helped to her feet. A bystander, who appears to be wearing a staff uniform can be seen in the background but makes no attempt to break up the fight. The footage of the scuffle was eventually uploaded to Facebook and was brought to the attention of local police, who are now investigating the incident. While the two girls brawl on the floor, staff members seem to stand by and watch and make no attempt to break them up . The girl struggles to get up as she is then dragged along the floor by her hair . They warn charges could come against the attackers. Byram Police Chief Luke Thomson told 7WDAM: 'They say a picture's worth a thousand words. If a picture's worth a thousand, a video's worth a million.And this video is very compelling in terms of the criminal charges that may be brought about.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia . Counter-terrorism experts have warned the threat of homegrown jihadists is growing as more Islamic extremists, like Khaled Sharrouf, take to social media to spread their ideologies. A spike in supporters for terror group Islamic State in Australia and posts relating to extremist views is a cause for concern, according to experts. It comes as it emerges the Federal Government has cut welfare payments to more than a dozen Australians who are thought to be fighting for terrorism group in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . The profile picture of the Twitter account which shares a similar name to those used by Australian terrorist Mohamed Elomar. Brave stand: Dr Jamal Rifi has denounced the actions of Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. Khaled Sharrouf's son, pictured holding a decapitated head (left), and another image of Sharrouf and young children (right). Pictured: Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar posed holding two decapitated heads in a disgusting display posted on social media in July. The Sydney Morning Herald reported shocking photos and aggressive threats made on social media sites, like Twitter, was drawing a fervent following. The latest of these posts are a threat against a Muslim doctor who spoke out against Sharrouf and another jihadist Mohamed Elomar and an image of Sharrouf's son holding a severed head. Posted underneath these taunts are messages of support for the jihadists from Sydney, and have spawned messages of support online. One of them was from a physical education teacher residing in Punchbowl who wrote on Facebook accompanied by pictures of Sharrouf: 'He was a good brother the area surely misses him.' While a personal trainer from Birrong launched a more worrying attack on the Australian Federal Police and the Abbott Government. 'F*kn dogs these Aussie police and this f***ed uop law with the f***ed up government that sucks Americas [sic] d***,' they wrote. Despite the rise in online chatter from jihad supporters, Australia's security threat level has not shifted from 'medium' - meaning an attack could happened - and counter-terrorism experts say the most significant concern facing the nation is a 'lone-wolf' attack. These types of attacks are similar to the Boston bombings or the attack on British soldier Lee Rigby who was hacked to death, according to Global Terrorism Research's Greg Barton. 'If they’ve got the savvy to plan something quietly without telling their mates, they may well pull something off,' he told Fairfax Media. 'I think we just have to accept that we might be lucky and not see that happen but there’s certainly enough intent and serious association that someone in this larger network might try to do something.' Fighting in Syria: Mohamed Elomar (pictured) is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria. Another Twitter image posted by Khaled Sharrouf. Meanwhile the Federal Government has stopped welfare payments to more than a dozen Australians who are suspected of terrorism activity in the Middle East, according to The Daily Telegraph. In July, it was reveal Khaled Sharrouf was still receiving a disability pension worth $383-a-week at least two months after he fled Australia for the Middle East on his brother's passport in December. The Federal Government believes there are about 150 Australians travelling to the Middle East to join up with extremist groups with 'tens of people' who had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations. A spokeswoman for Social Services Minister Kevin Andrews confirmed to The Daily Telegraph that the 'a number of individuals' who resided overseas had their welfare payments stopped, and repeated the government's commitment to cracking down on Australians who are involved in extremist activities benefiting from taxpayers' money. It is now looking at introducing more legislation to combat this issue, including people travelling to areas where terror groups are operating to justify their trips. This comes as a Muslim doctor who spoke out against Australian terrorists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar has been the target of threatening tweets from a Twitter account believed associated with Elomar on Wednesday morning. Twitter account 'Abu Hafs ozzie', which shares a similar username to ones previously used by the terrorist, tweeted on Wednesday: 'Anyone in Sydney who can give me the details of Habashi dog Dr Jamal Rifi, anything, house details, wat (sic) area am willing to pay $1,000. 'Any details were he works or knows if his got kids which school they attend. Like I said I am willing to pay $1000 just for details.' But Dr Rifi told Daily Mail Australia this morning he would not be afraid. 'Their actions shouldn't instil fear among us to the point where that fear will paralyse us,' he said. 'And that's why I would refuse to be fearful of their threats'. Dr Rifi made a number of public statements yesterday where he denounced the actions of the Australian terrorists. His condemnation followed Khaled Sharrouf releasing an image of his seven-year-old son holding a decapitated head in the Syrian city of Raqqa at the weekend. 'What we saw to be honest, (is) very disturbing, especially when it's done in the name of Islam,' Dr Rifi said. 'And it can only be done by a very sick person'. Dr Rifi, a prominent member of Sydney's Islamic community, was a finalist in the 2009 Australian Local Hero awards. He said he was familiar with Khaled Sharrouf's father but had never met the younger Sharrouf who has turned to terrorism. The Sydney-based doctor has played an instrumental part in forging positive relationships between the Muslim and wider Australian communities. He was a founding member of Muslim Doctors Against Violence and the Christian Muslim Friendship Society. Dr Rifi helped recruit and train Muslim youth as surf lifesavers at Cronulla beach following riots in the Sydney shire suburb in 2005. Daily Mail Australia approached NSW Police for comment.","Experts say there are more people posting about jihad on social media .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It may not be the kind of conversation you bring up at a dinner party, but we all use toilets and we all produce waste. To celebrate this fact, and get people talking more candidly about faeces, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo has set up its Toilet - Human Waste and Earth's Future’ exhibition. The exhibition is divided into eight areas covering topics from the smell and shape of human waste to sewage treatment and environmental problems. There are also giant toilets that teach children where waste goes after its flushed away, bathroom consoles, and themed hats. There are 2.5 billion people worldwide who don’t have access to toilets, leading to many children dying from unhygienic conditions. An estimated 2 millions deaths are caused each year by human excrement-related disease. Faeces can contain everything from flesh-eating bacteria to parasites. However, it could be possible to put it to good use. Scientists claim that worldwide, human waste produces 70 million tons of nutrients. This in turn could be used to produce 40 per cent of the 176 million tons of nutrients needed to produce chemical fertilizer, according to Vice. The exhibition runs until the 5 October. Scroll down for video . The Toilet - Human Waste and Earth's Future’ exhibition is being held at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo. The exhibition is divided into eight areas covering topics from the smell and shape of human waste (pictured) to sewage treatments and environmental problems . There are also giant toilets (pictured) fitted with slides, bathroom consoles, and themed hats to be worn by children visiting the exhibition, which runs until the 5 October. The toilet slide is designed to teach children where waste goes after the toilet has been flushed . Another section looks at the differences between animals faeces. The tiny poo of a lizard is pictured left, next to the larger faeces of the giant panda, right. This area also teaches visitors about gut flora, which determines the condition of faeces, as well as a person's health . The exhibition was set up to take 'a frank, entertaining look at what the perfect toilet would be for people around the world' and encourages visitors to talk more candidly about 'the generally taboo subject of the toilet' Interactive areas in the exhibition let children create faeces using plasticine (pictured left) and play games consoles fitted in bathrooms (pictured right) This image shows a young visitor looking at a typical Japanese squat toilet. A small piece of faeces sits above it. This section is designed to highlight the problems people have with bowel movements from school age up to when people are in nursing homes . Adult guides are on hand to explain different matters related to toilets to the children throughout the exhibition. In this image, an adult visitor is shown putting on the faeces hat . Children dance and sing during the talking toilet performance at the exhibition. The talking toilets explain what happens to waste once it has been flushed away, as well as why keeping toilets clean is so important . A traditional Japanese toilet and bathroom shoes. It is customary in Japan to replace outdoor shoes with slippers when entering someone's home.  The bathroom is considered a separate part of the house, and guests are expected to take off their house slippers and use a pair of bathroom slippers (pictured) instead . The flush toilet has served the world for more than 130 years but the bog-standard design has been given an eco-friendly facelift. Student designers have come up with a range of futuristic toilets that are better for the environment and could even prevent diseases. The 'Wellbeing Toilet' was recently crowned winner at a competition organised by Dyno-Rod Drains, which asked designers to create a loo that 'benefits our health and the environment'. The design - made from concrete, marble and ceramics - is the world's first ergonomically-correct toilet. It forces the user to sit in a 'healthier' squat position that helps reduce the risk of intestinal cancer and hemorrhoids, its designers claim. The 'Well-Being Toilet' makes the user sit in a 'squat' position, which designers claim is healthier and could help prevent health problems such as constipation and colon cancer .","The Toilet - Human Waste and Earth's Future’ exhibition is being held at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Asteroids in our solar system are thought to contain millions of pounds worth of minerals - and that's just a fraction of what neighbouring planets may hold. The wealth of materials is so rich, in fact, billionaires including the likes of Google’s Larry Page and Avatar director James Cameron are racing to be the first to harness these goods. And now a Californian artist has imagined the epic machines and structures needed by futuristic space miners to carry out these tasks, as we look to colonise and explore nearby planets. The concept images were created by Californian artist Cuba Lee. He depicts how space miners on large crafts (pictured) could extract minerals from space.  Asteroids in our solar system contain millions of pounds worth of minerals and firms are looking to harness these materials in the near future . Cuba Lee is a freelance artist, currently at Section Studios in Los Angeles. He specialises in concept artwork based on science, and science fiction. Although Cuba Lee’s images are concepts, space mining is an avenue being explored by firms and entrepreneurs. Asteroid mining involves exploiting raw materials from near-Earth rocks. Such asteroids are thought to contain a wealth of materials including gold, iron, nickel, titanium, hydrogen and oxygen. The company leading the charge when it comes to asteroid and space mining is Planetary Resources - set up in 2012 with backing from Google’s co-founders Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, as well as Avatar director James Cameron. Of the 9,000 known near-Earth asteroids, there are said to be more than 1,500 that are energetically as easy to reach as the moon. In one of his images, called Fuel Mining, Mr Lee depicts a large chamber that resembles circular gas plants on Earth. Hot gases are seen flowing through the floating chambers, attached to large power units. In another, drills, similar to those used on industrial plants, are seen puncturing rocky terrains. A huge craft that looks as if it’s been crafted from an asteroid is fitted with a large-turbine style wheel, which could be used to generate a form of energy to power the drills and research units. A futuristic office-style pyramid block is imagined in another image. Although Mr Lee’s images are only concepts, space mining is an avenue being explored by firms and entrepreneurs. The first step is to mine asteroids orbiting in the solar system. Asteroid mining involves exploiting raw materials, including minerals and volatiles, from near-Earth rocks.

Either these materials could be harvested as astronauts journey through space, or brought back to Earth and extracted for use. Entrepreneurs are hoping to extract these materials after experts claimed Earth supplies of elements including zinc, tin, silver, lead, gold and copper could run out within the next 60 years. Based on Lee’s vision of the future, transport vehicles could carry asteroids, or their materials, back to Earth or to other inhabited planets. They could also mine the materials mid-orbit.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Samsung warned earlier this month it was bracing itself for a drop in profit, but its latest earnings release reveals the dip may have been worse than expected. The South Korean firm announced its net income between April and June dropped 20 per cent - to 6.3 trillion won (£3.6 billion), down from 7.8 trillion won (£4.3 billion) - compared to the same time last year. There was also a 15 per cent drop in income compared to the first quarter of this year, sales fell 9 per cent, and operating profit sank 25 per cent.

The South Korean firm announced its net income between April and June dropped 20 per cent - to 6.3 trillion won (£3.6 billion) down from 7.8 trillion won (£4.3 billion) - compared to the same time last year. There was also a 15 per cent drop in income compared to the first quarter of this year, sales fell 9 per cent, and operating profit sank 25 per cent. Samsung sold 95 million mobile handsets in the quarter and smartphones were close to 80 per cent of those sales. By comparison, it sold 8 million tablet PCs. Samsung is still the world's largest supplier of smartphones, but its global market share fell to 25 per cent from 32 per cent. Research firm IDC estimated Samsung shipped 74.3 million smartphones during the second quarter, down 4 per cent from a year earlier, despite the overall smartphone market expanding 23 per cent. That was the lowest since the second quarter of 2012. This yearly drop was despite the launch of Samsung's new Gear range of smartwatches, and the Galaxy S5 in February. Samsung released a statement at the start of July claiming the second quarter would be its worst in two years, and blamed it on fading smartphone sales. Robert Yi, head of investor relations, told a conference call that Samsung had higher marketing expenses as competition increased in mid- to low-end smartphones, and because it tried to clear old inventory before the release of updated smartphone models in the fall. Tablet computer sales also fell, he said, citing weak overall demand. Samsung sold 95 million mobile handsets in the quarter, and smartphones made close to 80 per cent of those sales, Yi continued. By comparison, the firm sold 8 million tablet PCs. This global dip in tablet popularity was also recently seen in Apple’s earnings after the company posted a 9 per cent drop in iPad sales. Research firm IDC estimated Samsung shipped 74.3 million smartphones during the second quarter, down 4 per cent from a year earlier - despite the overall smartphone market expanding 23 per cent. The company particularly struggled to compete in cheap smartphones, and Samsung shares dived 4 per cent following the announcement in Seoul (pictured). This is the lowest since the second quarter of 2012 . Chinese vendors, Huawei and Lenovo, were the companies that drove growth in global smartphone sales. Samsung is still the world's largest supplier of smartphones but its global market share fell to 25 per cent from 32 per cent. Analysts said Samsung struggled in developing nations as consumers using handsets powered by Android were more willing to try devices from other brands. Smartphones have become ubiquitous in developed markets and are becoming so in emerging markets, making it harder to find people who are buying a smartphone for the first time, said Melissa Chau, senior research manager at IDC, a market research firm. ‘Just staying on Android is not going to keep you in one brand.’ Samsung sold 95 million mobile handsets in the quarter and smartphones were close to 80 per cent of those sales. By comparison, it sold 8 million tablet PCs. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is pictured . That would make it more important for Samsung to develop unique services for its Galaxy phone users or to push use of its own software that does not rely on Google's Android. After a nine months at the top of the charts, the iPhone 5S has been knocked off the top spot by cheaper Apple model, the iPhone 5C. That's according to the uSwitch.com Mobile Tracker, which is based on live searches, pre-orders and sales. Samsung’s Galaxy S5 remained in third place during July. The older Galaxy S4 slipped a place to fifth, allowing the iPhone 4S to move up a position. Samsung has stumbled in its efforts to make even a small move away from Android. Earlier this week, it delayed the release of the first smartphone powered by Tizen, its own mobile operating system, just two months after announcing a launch date. It did not give a future schedule. For the third quarter, Samsung forecast it would sell more handsets as there is usually higher demand for consumer electronics during that period. But it would also face higher competition. Apple is expected to release a new iPhone with a larger screen – a key feature in Galaxy phones that helped Samsung lure consumers from the iPhone in the first place. ‘Looking ahead, the second half of 2014 will remain a challenge,’ Samsung said in a statement. In the previous years, Samsung released one high-end model during the third quarter. But this year, Samsung hinted that there will be one additional high-end model. Kim Hyunjoon, senior vice president at Samsung's mobile business, told the conference call that several new handset models are in the pipeline for launch in the next few months. They include a new flagship model in the large-screen category and another premium phone with new design and materials. Kim did not elaborate what the new materials would be.","Net income between April and June dropped 20% from the previous year .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Use-by and sell-by dates have been heavily criticised for being inaccurate, especially when it comes to meat - resulting in tonnes of food being thrown away unnecessarily. To solve this problem of wastage, a more accurate method has been devised by a student from London that uses food labels filled with gelatine. The Bump Mark label is smooth to the touch to begin with, but as the food inside the packaging decays, the label becomes bumpy. Scroll down for video . The Bump Mark label (pictured) was designed by London student Solveiga Pakstaite for the James Dyson Award. It contains gelatine set over a plastic sheet and as the food begins to decay, so does the gelatine. When the gelatine decays it revels a bumpy layer. The smoother the gelatine, the safer the food is to eat . This means all anyone, including blind people, can quickly identify when food is safe to eat, and when it should be thrown away. The Bump Mark label is filled with gelatine, set over a bumpy plastic sheet (pictured) The Bump Mark label is filled with gelatine, set over a bumpy plastic sheet. Because jelly is solid when it sets, the bumps cannot be felt at first, but as the gelatine decays, it becomes a liquid. This means that the bumps underneath the plastic sheet can be felt, letting users know it has expired. Gelatine is protein, so it decays at the same rate as protein-based foods. The label simply copies what the food in the package is doing, so the expiry information is said to be far more accurate than a printed date. Designer Solveiga Pakstatie is currently in discussions with retailers and technology development companies to sell the label, and has a patent pending for the design. Bump Mark was invented for the James Dyson Award by Industrial Design and Technology student Solveiga Pakstaite from London's Brunel University. ‘Using gelatine to model the decay process of food, Bump Mark is able to tell you exactly the condition your food is in, simply by running your finger over the label,’ explained Pakstaite. ‘If it’s smooth, then you’re good to go, but if you start to feels bumps as the gelatine breaks down, be cautious.’ Earlier this month, the UN food report stated 40 per cent of all the food produced in the US is never eaten, and in Europe, residents throw away 100 million tonnes of food every year. Part of the issue was blamed on bad shopping habits and throwing away food even when it’s safe to eat. Pakstaite’s label is filled with gelatine, set over a bumpy plastic sheet.

This means all users, including blind people, can quickly identify when food is safe to eat, and when it should be thrown away . ‘I wanted to create a solution for enabling visually impaired consumers to gain expiry information about their food, as currently the only indication is a printed date,’ continued Pakstaite. ‘From the start, I knew that the solution must appeal to sighted people also, because the sad reality is that new solutions only get implemented by companies if the benefits are useful to the majority. ‘This is why I worked to create a cheap solution that could be applied to existing food packages and also provides information that even sighted people haven't had access to before: information about the actual condition of food.’ The label design went through more than 20 iterations, each of which were tested for user perception and technical performance. This graphic reveals how the layer is created. Gelatine is solid when it sets, meaning the bumps cannot be felt at first, but as the gelatine decays, it becomes a liquid. This means that the bumps underneath the plastic sheet can be felt, letting users know it has expired . The technology is similar to patches unveiled earlier this year. These patches (pictured) contain gel that starts out red but changes colour over time, as its ingredients react with each other. The rate of the colour change corresponds with the speed of growth of the food poisoning bug E coli at different temperatures . Pakstaite is currently in discussions with retailers and technology development companies to sell the label, and has a patent pending for the design. Her design recently won the Inclusive Design Award, awarded by Made in Brunel and sponsored by Crown Packaging. Pakstaite was previously winner of the James Dyson Foundation scholarship at Brunel University. The national winners of the James Dyson Awards will be announced on 18 September. It is open to any university-level student of product design, industrial design or engineering studying across Europe, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the US.

The 27-year-old Coogee man who collapsed near the finish line of the City2Surf fun run and later died of a cardiac arrest is Fox Sports employee and Crossfit enthusiast Chris Head. Mr Head's younger brother, Jonathan, posted a brief message on Chris's Facebook wall alerting family and friends of the tragic news. 'I'm very sorry to inform everyone that Chris collapsed yesterday at the finish line of the City 2 Surf,' he wrote. Scroll down for video . Chris Head, 27, who died at the City2Surf. A 27-year-old man has died in hospital after collapsing near the end of the City2Surf fun run in Sydney on Sunday morning . At least half a dozen St John Ambulance officers rushed to the unconscious man as hundreds of runners dashed by towards the finishing line . 'He died of a heart attack shortly afterward.' 'This has been an indescribable shock to us all and we loved him more than we can say.' 'We wish to thank everyone for their kindness, support and condolences.' Mr Head was rushed to hospital around 11am after his fall near the finish line. Runners streamed past as six paramedics rushed to his assistance, placed him on a stretcher and stabilised him. He was then taken to St Vincent's Hospital in a critical condition, but died soon after. A person close to the family said it was unclear what caused Mr Head's death. An image from Mr Head's Facebook page. A fitness-related Facebook image from Mr Head's social media accounts. Fox Sports CEO Patrick Delany confirmed the news in an email to all staff. 'I have spoken with Chris’ father and passed on all of our condolences,' Mr Delany told employees. He described Mr Head as a 'much loved' colleague and 'Crossfit enthusiast' who had recently returned from a trip to Kakadu. 'Its time to pull together and support each other as well as Chris’ family and friends in this very sad time,' Mr Delany said. Mr Head took his fitness seriously, according to a number of posts on his Facebook page. On July 24, just weeks before the 14km run, he wrote on the website: ""Last night I ran 17.26km in 2hr and 6min in prep for the City 2 Surf which is 14km long. I might have over done it!"" He shared many online memes about fitness and nutrition. One image he shared on July 31 said: ""The best ab exercise is 5 sets of stop eating so much crap."" On August 5 he shared a post about being committed to lifting weights. ""DEDICATION: When the voice in your head says, 'It's too early, dark and cold... go back to bed'... then the beastmode voice kicks the little voice's ass... and you get up. And lift some s**t.' There are reports the man was running the race with his partner, who was not with him when he collapsed . The man was stabilised at the scene and taken to hospital where he died shortly after . A witness said the runner was 'almost crawling' towards the finish line of the 14km race. ABC reporter Anne Barker saw the events unfold from the finish line. 'I turned around and saw him almost crawling, clearly in trouble, but still trying to reach the line. He was barely a metre away,' she told the national broadcaster. 'He was very white. Suddenly he just collapsed on the ground, rolled on his side and stopped moving. 'Ambulance officers ran over, put him on a stretcher and by then he was obviously unconscious. 'It was all the more distressing because runners were just streaming past him, so clearly happy to have finished, many unaware of what had happened.' There are reports the man was running the race with his partner, who was not with him when he collapsed near the end. The man was among the 80,000 runners who participated in the 14km race from Sydney CBD to Bondi Beach. Race organisers have called the man's death 'a moment of enormous sadness' and say their thoughts are with his loved ones. It was a tragic turn for the world's biggest fun run, which this year raised more than $4 million for charity. More than 80,000 runners participated in the 14-kilometre race from Sydney CBD to Bondi Beach . This year's death is the third in the iconic race's 43-year-history, with the most recent being 26-year-old British man Lee Marriage who collapsed and died 200 metres from finishing the race due to a heart attack six years ago. It was reported that Mr Marriage was not a registered runner and had used somebody else's registration to take part. In 2000 a man aged in his late 30s suffered a heart attack and also died during the race. Former University of NSW professor Michael O'Rourke said at the time of Mr Marriage's death  there was generally one cause of cardiac arrest or arrhythmia during the City2Surf each year, but they were often revived thanks to the use of a defibrillator, reported Nine News. The fun run event has been held since 1971. People including TV vet Dr Chris Brown and NRL star Beau Ryan and  posted their condolences to the man on social media. Dr Brown said: ""Heartbreaking that a fun run could claim a young man's life. Life is a fragile thing. My thoughts are with his family tonight #city2surf."" Mr Ryan said: 'Thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of the young man who lost his life running the #City2Surf today'.

"By . Jenny Awford For Mailonline . Students will be heading back to class next week for the first time since their Oklahoma elementary school was destroyed by an EF5 tornado – killing seven pupils. Plaza Towers has now been rebuilt following the tornado that flattened Moore on 20 May 2013, causing an estimated $2billion in property damage. The elementary school, which cost $12million to refurbish, has installed seven benches  to represent the children who lost their lives. Scroll down for video . Construction continues on the exterior of the new Plaza Towers elementary school in Moore, Oklahoma. The school was destroyed by an EF5 tornado on 20 May 2013, killing seven students . A tree which was ravaged by the tornado, and at one time showed signs of revival, was named the 'Hope Tree' by fourth grade teacher Kimberly Martinez . Officials from the elementary school and Moore Public Schools led a media tour of the new building on Tuesday. Michelle McNear, assistant superintendent for elementary education and instruction for Moore Public Schools said: ‘I don't want to be ... a district that is remembered by May 20. ‘We want to be remembered as a district and a community as how we worked through it and the way we handled things.’ A memorial dedicated to the pupils who were killed is expected to be completed later this year. Pre-K teacher Erika Rowell points out the steel-beam reinforced wall in her classroom at the new Plaza Towers. The four rooms in this quad and the hallway are a FEMA-approved safe area . A container full of helmets to protect the pupils are shown during the tour of the new school on Tuesday . A brick wall with a panther painted on it, salvaged from the old Plaza Towers elementary school, has been incorporated into the new school . It will include silhouettes of seven children with personal touches such as a soccer ball to represent each child. The silhouettes will not have names, but the families will know which one represents their child based on the personal touches. Moore Public Schools Superintendent Robert Romines said the memorial ‘is very symbolic to the students we lost’. The new brick building includes a designated Federal Emergency Management Agency-approved safe area with four classrooms and a hallway where students can congregate when there's severe weather. The classrooms are equipped with bathrooms, and the hallway has no windows — setups designed to prevent storm debris from flying and injuring students. A memorial at the entrance of the school, dedicated to the seven students who were killed, is expected to be completed later this year . This classroom, with a separate bathroom, can be used as a safe room for severe weather or other lockdown situtaitons . The old Plaza Towers did not have a safe room. Students also will be welcomed by a large brick wall with a panther on it. Officials were able to salvage the panther wall from the old Plaza Towers and install it into the new building. Principal Patrick Chase said students chose the name ‘Paws’ for the panther. ‘It's probably my favorite feature of the building,’ said Mr Chase. The first day of school is Aug 19.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . For many families, days out have been replaced with hours in front of a games console or phone. And new research blames this rising trend on parents for spoiling their offspring with the latest expensive gadgets throughout the year. A survey of 2,000 adults found parents are spending a combined £2.25 billion on gadgets every 12 monthsfor their children - with teenage girls and the under-fives being spoilt the most. The survey polled 2,000 British adults about their tech spending habits. Parents were found to spend a combined £2.25 billion on gadgets a year for their offspring - and children under five were among the most spoilt (stock image pictured) at £394 a year each .

Researchers found the top . last-minute activities include looking up travel directions, shopping, making . payments, and booking holidays. However, 59 per cent admitted that . devices have frozen on them, they’ve not been able to get online, or the . battery has died, leaving them to seek alternative methods. Many of these alternatives are more expensive, and users end up wasting money. The survey was commissioned by energy firm E.ON. It found a typical child now owns four gadgets and parents on the whole spend £292 per child, every year. Teenagers aged between 15 and 17 are the most tech-savvy, each owning on average seven devices, including laptops, tablets and phones. However, parents with sons aged over 18 are spending over £717 on gadgets, while daughters get devices worth £992 a year.

"By . Jill Reilly For Mailonline . A British-born man and his wife have been told by authorities in Iceland they will not renew their 10-year-old daughter's passport on the grounds that she is called Harriet – which is not on a government approved list of names. Tristan Cardew and his Icelandic wife Kristin are appealing against the Reykjavik National Registry's decision, which also does not recognise the name of Harriet's 12-year-old brother Duncan either. The couple, from Kópavogur, have for years travelled with their children using passports featuring the names 'Girl' and 'Boy' because neither of their names are recognised by the country's strict list of permissible names. A British-born man and his wife have been told by authorities in Iceland they will not renew their 10-year-old daughter's passport on the grounds that she is called Harriet – which is not on a government approved list of names . But when they came to renew Harriet's passport ahead of a planned family holiday to France, authorities decided to enforce a law banning the issue of any official document to people who do not have an 'approved Icelandic name'. The couple have appealed the decision. 'They have deprived our daughter of freedom of movement,' said Mrs Cardew reported visir.is. For parents in Iceland there is a list of 1,853 female names, and 1,712 male ones, and parents must pick from these lists or seek permission from a special committee. For parents in Iceland there is a list of 1,853 female names, and 1,712 male ones, and parents must pick from these lists or seek permission from a special committee . All the names fit Icelandic grammar and pronunciation rules and officials claim they will protect children from embarrassment. Parents can take from the list or apply to a committee with alternative ideas. This means in Iceland, which has a population of 320,000, you are allowed to name your baby Elvis, Viking, Frigg or Horn, but not Ben, Dominic, Jennifer, Liam or Yasmin. Although the law has become more relaxed in recent years choices such as Cara, Carolina, Cesil, and Christa have been rejected outright because the letter 'c' is not part of Iceland's 32-letter alphabet. For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half. Harriet was rejected on the grounds that 'It can't be conjugated in Icelandic,' said according to Mr Cardew. Given names are even more significant in tiny Iceland than in many other countries - everyone is listed in the phone book by their first names, while surnames are based on a parent's given name.

"By . Leon Watson . The captain and three senior crew members of a South Korean ferry that sank killing more than 280 passengers have been charged with manslaughter, it emerged today. Prosecutors also indicted the 11 other surviving crew members of the ferry Sewol on negligence charges. Captain Lee Joon-seok and the crew has been under criminal investigation after they were believed to have escaped the sinking vessel before many passengers. Lee Joon-Seok (centre), captain of South Korean ferry Sewol which sank at sea off Jindo, is seen as he is sent to a prosecutor's office in Mokpo, South Korea . Arrest: Lee Joon-seok, centre, was pictured being led towards a court in Mokpo, south of Seoul, following his arrest . Investigators believe that the Sewol ferry, pictured, capsized last month as the ship was carrying excess cargo . 'The captain, a first officer and second officer and the chief engineer escaped before the passengers, leading to grave casualties,' prosecutor Ahn Sang-don, who is leading the investigation, said. Ahn said the Sewol was severely compromised in its ability to maintain stability after a remodelling to add capacity, and had set sail on April 16 massively overloaded and with insufficient water in the ballast tanks used to keep it steady. Strong currents in the disaster zone made the vessel less responsive to navigation and prompted the crew to make a turn of 15 degrees, sharper than advisable, which led the ferry to list rapidly and then sink, he said. 'The captain should have been in command of the navigation, but left that to a third officer, and that is gross negligence,' Ahn said, adding there was enough evidence to support a charge of willful negligence on the part of the captain and three other officers. 'The charge of homicide was applied because they did not exercise their duty of aid and relief, leading to the deaths of passengers,' he said, adding that some crew had confessed 'they were thinking about their own lives.' The Sewol was on a routine journey from the mainland port of Incheon to the southern holiday island of Jeju. Relatives holding portraits of their children who perished when the Sewol ferry sank with the loss of around 300 lives stage a sit-in protest demanding to see South Korean President Park Geun-Hye in Seoul . A protestor puts up yellow origami boats on the side of a police vehicle while relatives with children who perished when the Sewol ferry sank . Of the 476 passengers and crew on . board, 339 were children and their teachers on a school trip. Only 172 . people were rescued, with the rest presumed to have drowned. A . month after the disaster, 281 bodies have been recovered but 23 people . remain missing, even as rescue divers continue to search the vessel. Some . of the crew, including the captain, were caught on videotape abandoning . ship while the children were repeatedly told to stay put in their . cabins and await further orders. Safest way to travel? Captain Lee Joon-seok says he believes ferries are the safest form of transport 'as long as passengers follow the instructions of our crew' in a 2010 promotional video . Abandon ship: Apparently wearing no trousers, Lee Joon-seok, 68, is seen clambering over the heavily-listing vessel's rails as he is helped onto a lifeboat while the ferry is still above water . Saving himself: He is then helped onto a life raft leaving hundreds of passengers behind . The government of President Park Geun-hye has faced sharp criticism for its handling of the disaster and the rescue effort, with an outpouring of anger over suggestions that a more effective initial response could have saved many more. Prosecutors are seeking the arrest of members of the family that owns the ferry operator, and may also seek the extradition of a son of the reclusive head of the family from the United States, an official said on Thursday. Prosecutors are also investigating officials of shipping inspection agencies and the operator of the ferry. The crew members' first court date has yet to be set.

"By . Will Stewart . A senior Russian aide today blasted the Ukrainian government 'a Nazi Frankenstein' as the crisis-hit country signed a 'historic' trade deal with the European Union. Outspoken Sergei Glazyev said the Ukrainian leader's endorsement of an historic pact with the EU was 'illegitimate'. The signing earlier today by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko in Brussels puts his country on track for eventual EU membership while taking a giant symbolic step away from Moscow's orbit. Scroll down for video . Sergei Glazyev, left, who is a close aide to the Russian president described Ukrainian president Petro Porshenko, right, as a 'Nazi Frankenstein' accusing him of organising a military coup in Ukraine . President Petro Poroshenko, pictured, signed the agreement this morning at the EU Council offices in Brussels, despite the strong objections of Moscow . The extraordinary Nazi jibe from Glazyev - a key architect of Putin's strategy on Crimea and Ukraine - highlights a deep loathing between those close to the Kremlin leader and the new government in Kiev. 'Europe is trying to push Ukraine to sign this agreement by force,' the Russian president's adviser on regional economic integration told the BBC. 'They organised a military coup in Ukraine, they helped Nazis to come to power. This Nazi government is bombing the largest region in Ukraine.' Asked if he believed Mr Poroshenko was a Nazi he replied: 'Of course.' He warned that people in the EU would regret bringing Ukraine into the fold. 'The European public will be... surprised when this Nazi Frankenstein, which was born by the Euro bureaucrats and some politicians, will knock on the European countries' doors,' he claimed. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, centre, was greeted by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, left and European Council President Herman Van Romuy, right after signing the historic agreement . Poroshenko was an 'illegitimate' president because parts of eastern Ukraine did not vote in May elections, so he had no right to sign today's EU accord. The deal between the 28-country European Union and Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia concerns broad trade and economic agreements. The closer relationship with the EU led to protests against the old pro-Russian Viktor Yankuvych, who did not want today's agreement to proceed. President Poroshenko described today's agreement as 'the most important day' for his country since independence from the Soviet Union. He said: 'It's absolutely a new perspective for my country.' The failure of former president Yanukovych to sign the deal precipitated the current crisis.

A Ukrainian mother wearing a national flag holds her daughter who is wrapped in a European Union flag as they attend a gathering in Independence Square  in Kiev, to celebrate the signing of a historic EU-Ukraine association agreement . President Porshenko said he signed the agreement with the same pen Yanukovych was supposed to use last year. He said: 'Historic events are unavoidable.' President Poroshenko reminded EU . leaders of the Ukrainians who died opposing Yanukovych's government and . in the ongoing battle against the pro-Russian insurgency in the . country's east. He said Ukraine 'paid the highest possible price to make . her European dreams come true.' He asked EU leaders to take a further step and formally pledge that one day Ukraine can join the EU as a full-fledged member. That 'would cost the European Union nothing,' he said, 'but would mean the world to my country.' As part of the agreement, Ukraine has to accept EU product regulations as well as introducing new rules on copyright, government contracts and reducing corruption. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for restraint in Ukraine following a recent escalation in violence along Ukraine's eastern border with Russia . Russian President Vladimir Putin said the most important thing was to guarantee a 'long-term cease fire' in Ukraine . Glazyev's attack seemed at odds with Putin's moves in recent days to help the peace process - and avoid a threatened new round of crippling sanctions. The controversial aide recently called on Putin to destroy Ukraine's military capability and met separatists in eastern regions who are seeking to join Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin did not immediately comment on the trade pact, but in recent days has signaled that he wants to de-escalate the conflict ahead of talks later Friday by the EU's heads of state and government on whether to ramp up sanctions against Russia over its conduct toward Ukraine. He said: 'The most important thing is to guarantee a long-term cease-fire as a precondition for meaningful talks between the Kiev authorities and representatives of the southeast (of Ukraine).' The U.N. said Friday that 110,000 Ukrainians had fled to Russia this year and another 54,000 fled their homes but stayed in Ukraine as the government fought with separatists in the mostly Russian-speaking east.

"By . Will Stewart . Hopes of an end to the Ukrainian conflict look bleak after the release of a deeply disturbing video purportedly showing two hostages being 'executed' on the orders of a pro-Russian separatist leader. Some sources claim the macabre footage is staged but 'meant to provoke terror' while others fear it is authentic. A man resembling Igor Bezler, a Russian separatist leader, in the mining town of Horlivka, twinned with Barnsley, is seen in a darkened cellar ordering the shooting of two blindfolded pro-Ukrainian men, and threatening others if Kiev fails to release its separatist captives. 'Execution': A man, believed to be a Russian separatist leader, was filmed ordering the deaths of two men . Threats: The man says that he will continue to kill two men an hour until Ukrainian authorities release their captives . 'If my man is not released soon, every hour we will shoot two officers,' threatened the mustachioed man believed to be Bezler in a video aimed at the Ukrainian authorities. He claimed to be holding three SBU secret services colonels and three lieutenant-colonels held as hostage. 'At the moment all agreement with Ukrainian side are broken. I have been waiting for three days but I do not have more time to wait. 'Mr Budyk and Mr Vasyuschenko will be shot dead now.... if my man is not free in one hour, second two will be shot, in another hour and a half, the third two. Until all eight officers are shot dead. If the Ukrainian army and state does not need these officers, I do not need them either.' Slumped: A gunshot can be heard in the video, after which the two blindfolded men fall to the ground. It has been suggested that the video could be staged . The then gives the order to a marksman armed with a Kalashnikov to shoot and two men - their backs to the gunmen and camera - are seen collapsing on the floor to the sound of gunfire. A pro-Ukrainian activist called Vasyl Budyk was abducted in Horlivka on 2 May. Alexander Khryakov, a leader of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, is on record as claiming the video is authentic, though several sources have expressed doubts. The Ukrainians allege that Bezler is a serving office in Russian military intelligence. Following the video's release acting president Oleksandr Turchynov warned: 'The Russian citizen Igor ""Bes"" Bezler is a criminal and murderer, that is why he should be punished under the Ukrainian and international law. 'He will not manage to escape this punishment.' He also stressed that the authorities 'were not holding negotiations with murderers and terrorists'. Topic of conversation: Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two men spoke of 'the soonest end to bloodshed in south-eastern Ukraine and combat actions by both parties' - separatists and Kiev's armed forces .

"By . Will Stewart . Rebels supporting Moscow yesterday threatened to set up a separatist 'state' called 'New Russia' in eastern Ukraine as they called on women to take up arms in their militias. The controversial move suggests to critics they are following a script dictated by Vladimir Putin who, in turn, is eyeing land originally won for Russia by Catherine the Great more than two centuries ago. Separatists are plotting to announce the merger of Ukrainian regions Donetsk and Lugansk into a new 'country' which they hope will swallow other southern parts of the ex-Soviet republic, it was revealed yesterday. Scroll down for video . A masked and armed supporter of the Donetsk People's Republic guards a checkpoint near Donetsk, Ukraine . Rebel 'governor' of Donetsk, Paval Gubarev, said: 'Unification is highly likely, and this will be the basis of the ""Novorossiya’ (New Russia) state.' Another leading official Denis Pushilin said negotiations were underway between Donetsk and Lugansk to recreate on the map the ‘Novorossiya’ name that was once given to these territories after their incorporation in Imperial Russia by Catherine the Great in the 18th century. The pro-Moscow “defence minister” of the breakaway Donetsk region, Igor Strelkov, yesterday appealed on the web for more people to take up arms in support of independence from Ukraine. 'If men are not willing, then we have no other option than to call up women and take them into the militias,' he said. Masked and armed supporters of the Donetsk People's Republic with armoured vehicles guard a checkpoint near Donetsk, Ukraine . Pushilin added: 'We need strong men to protect our republic because civil war is raging in our region.'Many men are falling every day, so we need more.' The original 'New Russia' was set up after Catherine’s conquests 220 years ago, a vast swathe of Ukrainian territory from Kharkiv in the north-east to Odessa in the south-west as well as Transitria - now a breakaway part of Moldova - in the west. Putin in a televised question and answer session last month implied there was an injustice in this territory being outside Russia. The controversial move suggests to critics they are following a script dictated by Vladimir Putin . 'Novorossiya - Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, Odessa were not part of Ukraine in Tsarist times,' he said. 'They were transferred in 1920 [after the Bolshevik Revolution]. Why? God knows.' If Putin did annex these Ukrainian provinces, it would leave a rump Ukraine without any coastline on the Black Sea. The calls came amid that next Sunday’s (25 May) scheduled Ukrainian presidential election will be reduced to farce. Election chiefs admit they will not be able to conduct the poll in eastern regions controlled by pro-Russian militias which means it will not be a nationwide poll.","Move suggests critics they are following a script dictated by Vladimir Putin .

"By . Will Stewart . and Simon Tomlinson . Children have become pawns in the escalating civil war between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian fighters as new battles raged overnight in the besieged city of Slavyansk. Pictures emerged of a protest with children holding signs begging the Kiev forces to halt their assault in the city, the epicentre of pro-Moscow resistance in the east of the country. Ukraine claims that the pro-Russian 'terrorists' are using children and women as 'human shields' in Slavyansk, basing themselves in residential buildings.

Moscow, it has been claimed. The . document, which was quickly taken down, reportedly appeared on the . website of the President of Russia's Human Rights Council. It . apparently revealed there was only a 30 per cent turnout of which half voted for annexation, it was reported by Forbes which cited . claims by major Ukrainian news website TSN.ua. The . figure of 15 per cent is vastly lower than Vladimir Putin's claims that . 97 per cent had voted in favour with an 83 per cent turnout. The TSN report does not link to a copy of the report. However, . Forbes says there is another report called Problems of Crimean . Residents on the Human Rights Council's website that contains estimates . of the March 16 vote.

Automatic gunfire and explosions were heard overnight amid suspicions that pro-Russian forces are seeking to break out of the encircled city where there are reported to be food and medical shortages. It came as the Russian Foreign Ministry today called on Kiev to immediately stop 'the use of force against its own people' in the unrest. In a statement, it said: 'The illegitimate authorities in Kiev go on crudely trampling on widely-recognised rights, with the connivance of their Western patrons.' Earlier, Ukrainian forces seized the rebel-held city hall in the eastern port city of Mariupol overnight, driving out pro-Russian activists, then withdrew, making no attempt to hold onto the building, witnesses said. Ukraine's Channel 5 television said earlier the Ukrainian National Guard had seized the administrative centre in Mariupol, a mainly Russian-speaking city of half a million and key component in the self-declared breakaway People's Republic of Donetsk that will hold a referendum on secession this weekend. However, the Ukrainian flag, hoisted by the police, was taken down and replaced by the separatists' Donetsk People's Republic flag after just three hours. Witnesses said the soldiers left after smashing furniture and office equipment. The smell of tear gas hung in the air inside the building which was largely empty in the morning, except for activists in gas masks clearing debris.

"By . Will Stewart . Victim: Mark Ivanyuk, 16, was beaten to death on his way home from a disco in the Ukranian speaking city of Rivine . A grieving mother has claimed that her 16 year old student son was beaten and killed by Russian policemen in Crimea - because he spoke Ukrainian. Russian police have so far declined to comment on the case in which student Mark Ivanyuk died of head injuries after he was approached by officers following an Easter disco. Mother Tatyana Ivanyuk, 34, said she is deeply disturbed by an alleged fight with police that occurred when her son and a friend called Kolya were returning home late at night. 'Kolya told me they were calm though a bit drunk. It was foggy and they saw the policemen driving towards them,' she said. 'The boys asked for a lift to Valenyevka. The policemen refused them in a rough way.' Kolya told her he was then knocked out, and has no memory of what happened or of police leaving the scene. 'I came round, started to scream, and could not stand up. Mark was lying next to me with a smashed head,' he said. 'My Mark was all beaten - legs, arms, head. I suspect it was the policemen,' said Mrs Ivanyuk. 'I think it was because he began to talk to them in Ukrainian. He spoke only Ukrainian, and I suspect this is the reason why the fight started. 'When I arrived at the police station to make my complaint they grimaced when they heard the Ukrainian language.' Crimea's new Russian law enforcement authorities 'were mocking me speaking Ukrainian while writing down what had happened.' The mother has called for a full investigation into her son's death and posted an appeal for eyewitnesses, while also releasing a picture of her son's face from his coffin at his funeral. She is backed by a group of human rights defenders in Crimea. Devastating: Mark's mother described how his body was 'beaten all over', accusing drunk police officers of the killing . Plea: The mother has called for a full investigation into her son's death and posted an appeal for eyewitnesses . The teenager from the Ukrainian speaking city of Rivne in the west of the country.

In . theory, after a promise by Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian remains an . official language in Crimea alongside Russian, spoken by the vast . majority, and Crimean Tatar. Human . rights activist Olexandra Dvoretska, from organisation Diya, said: 'We . are trying to find out the details of the incident and before we know . them we cannot make any conclusions on the reasons of the violence. 'But I do not exclude language as a reason. Speaking Ukrainian could have the escalated violence.' Many ethnic Ukrainians have now left the peninsula.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A Missouri inmate has been put to death for raping and killing a college student, making him the first U.S. prisoner put to death since the Arizona lethal injection went horrendously awry last month. The Missouri Department of Corrections said Michael Worthington was executed by lethal injection at the state prison and was pronounced dead at 12.11am yesterday. He is the seventh Missouri inmate to be executed this year. Worthington had been sentenced to death for the attack on 24-year-old Melinda 'Mindy' Griffin during a burglary of her Lake St Louis condominium in 1995. Offered no apology: Michael Worthington was executed in Missouri for raping and killing a student despite an appeal to the Supreme Court to delay the death sentence because of recent botched executions . Before the execution began, while . strapped to a gurney and covered with a sheet, Worthington spoke with . his witnesses — some of them his relatives — through the glass, raising . his shaved head. When the . drugs began flowing, his head lowered back to the pillow and he appeared . to breathe heavily for about 15 seconds before closing his eyes. Some . of his witnesses began crying after he fell unconscious. A Bible had been placed on his chest at his request, and he left a six-sentence written statement offering no apology. The U.S. Supreme Court and Missouri's governor had declined on Tuesday to block the execution. Worthington, . 43, had predicted that the nation's high court and Governor Jay Nixon would . not spare him, insisting in a telephone interview with The Associated . Press news agency that he had accepted his fate. 'I . figure I'll wake up in a better place tomorrow,' Worthington, formerly . of Peoria in central Illinois, had said Tuesday. 'I'm just accepting of . whatever's going to happen because I have no choice. The courts don't . seem to care about what's right or wrong anymore.' Killer: Joseph Wood gasped for two hours when was executed by lethal injection in Arizona last month . Worthington's . attorneys had pressed the Supreme Court to put off his execution, . citing the Arizona execution and two others that were botched in Ohio . and Oklahoma as well as the secrecy involving the drugs used during the . process in Missouri. Those . three executions in recent months have renewed the debate over lethal . injection. In Arizona, the inmate gasped more than 600 times and took . nearly two hours to die. In April, an Oklahoma inmate died of an . apparent heart attack 43 minutes after his execution began. And in . January, an Ohio inmate snorted and gasped for 26 minutes before dying. Most lethal injections take effect in a fraction of that time, often . within 10 or 15 minutes. Arizona, . Oklahoma and Ohio all use midazolam, a drug more commonly given to help . patients relax before surgery. In executions, it is part of a two- or . three-drug lethal injection. Texas . and Missouri instead administer a single large dose of pentobarbital — . often used to treat convulsions and seizures and to euthanize animals. Missouri changed to pentobarbital late last year and since has carried . out executions during which inmates showed no obvious signs of distress. Missouri . and Texas have turned to compounding pharmacies to make versions of . pentobarbital. But like most states, they refuse to name their drug . suppliers, creating a shroud of secrecy that has prompted lawsuits. In . denying Worthington's clemency request, Nixon called Worthington's rape . and killing of Griffin 'horrific,' noting that 'there is no question . about the brutality of this crime — or doubt of Michael Worthington's . guilt.' Worthington was . sentenced to death in 1998 after pleading guilty to Griffin's death, . confessing that in September 1995 he cut open a window screen to break . in to the college finance major's condominium in Lake St. Louis, just . west of St. Louis. Worthington admitted he choked Griffin into . submission and raped her before strangling her when she regained . consciousness. He stole her car keys and jewelry, along with credit . cards he used to buy drugs. DNA tests later linked Worthington to the slaying. Worthington, . much as he did after his arrest, insisted to the AP on Tuesday from his . holding cell near the death chamber that he couldn't remember details . of the killing and that he was prone to blackouts due to alcohol and . cocaine abuse. Campaign: Three bungled executions in recent months have renewed the debate over lethal injections . He said a life prison sentence would have been more . appropriate for him. 'In 20 . years, no one's seen or heard from me,' he said. 'If I'm the one who did . it, what do they think life without parole is — a piece of cake? On Tuesday, Griffin's 76-year-old parents anticipated witnessing Worthington die. 'It's . been 19 years, and I feel like there's going to be a finality,' Griffin's mother, Carol Angelbeck said after flying to Missouri . from their Florida home. 'I won't have to ever deal . with the name Michael Worthington again. I'm hoping for my family's . sake, my sake, that we can go there (to the prison) and get this over . with.' 'In this case, there . is no question in anyone's mind he did it, so why does it take 18 or 19 . years to go through with this?' added Jack Angelbeck, Griffin's father. 'This drags on and on. At this point, it's ridiculous, and hopefully . it's going to end.' Worthington, when asked what he would say to Griffin's parents, directed his comments to her mother. 'If . my life would bring her peace and bring Mindy back, I'd be fine with . that. But it won't,' he said. 'It doesn't bring peace or closure. She's . still going to have her broken heart.'","Michael Worthington had appealed to supreme court to delay execution .

Doggy driver: The husky puppy 'went mad' after being locked in the car when the owner went shopping and accidentally started the engine . ‘The car was parked on a small hill which helped it get going,’ the eyewitness told Siberian Times. ‘The puppy was even steering the wheel, so that the car made a small semicircle and crashed into a parked Mercedes and then a SsangYong car.’ Police were ’in stitches of laughter when they realised what had happened’, she said. The police had no idea who to make responsible for the crash and the Lada owner blamed the puppy for damage to the other vehicles.

"By . Richard Shears . and Simon Tomlinson . Victim: Police said Aiwa Matsuko was killed during a visit to the accused schoolgirl's apartment . A Japanese schoolgirl arrested for allegedly decapitating a classmate and cutting off her hand reportedly told police that she had 'wanted to dissect' someone, it emerged today. Police who went to the 15-year-old high school girl's apartment in Sasebo, 900 miles south west of Tokyo, found the bedroom soaked in blood, with the decapitated body of her friend lying on the bed. The 15-year-old suspect was being interviewed today to establish the reason for the alleged murder. Police named the victim as Aiwa Matsuko, also 15, who died when she visited the accused schoolgirl's apartment in Sasebo, in Nagasaki Prefecture, 900 miles south west of Tokyo. A police investigator told the AFP news agency that the accused admitted to strangling the victim before severing her head and left hand 'using tools... and something like a cord'. Police alleged that the suspect struck Matsuo on the back of the head more than 10 times with a blunt instrument and while she was unconscious strangled her. Then as a final act, it is alleged, the suspect, who has not been named because she is a minor, cut off Matsuo's head and her left hand with a large knife. The horrific crime came to light after Matsuo's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home. Police said Matsuo had earlier sent a message to her parents to say she was going to visit her friend at her apartment - then later sent her parents a text at around 7pm to say she was about to leave for home. What had started out as a casual inquiry about a schoolgirl returning home late from a friend's house turned out to be an alleged investigation into one of the country's most shocking crimes in recent years. Police found Matsuko's body lying on the suspect's blood-soaked bed. The knife and an unspecified 'blunt instrument' were lying nearby. Scroll down for video .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Fans of The Simpsons and Family Guy have been given a first look at the hotly anticipated crossover episode after a teaser was released at the Comic Con festival. The one-hour Fox special – titled The Simpsons Guy – sees the Griffin family journey to Springfield from their Quahog home to bond with Homer and co. But the teaser begins with a distinctly unimpressed Peter Griffin revealing his scepticism with their new environment. As they walk through the town, he warns . his family: 'Don’t drink the water around here... everyone around here . looks like they have hepatitis.' Scroll down for video . Cartoon collaboration: A clip from the upcoming Simpsons/ Family crossover episode where the two families go head-to-head for the first time with predictably eventful consequences . Bonding: Bart gives Stewie and Brian an example of his trademark prank call to Moe's tavern . Relations warm, however, when the two fathers head down to Apu's store to indulge in their mutual love of doughnuts. The children also share bonding sessions, with Bart giving Stewie a lesson in his trademark prank call to Moe's tavern. Stewie isn't quick to catch on, though, and tries his own hoax - which falls down with disturbing flatness. 'Hello, Moe,' he begins. 'Your sister's just been raped.' Bar bickering: Having bonded over their love of doughnuts, Peter and Homer argue over which beer is best . Later, Homer and Peter's friendship breaks down into a full-scale battle after they argue about beer. Their fight sees them turned into Incredible Hulk-style characters after a nuclear disaster at Springfield power plant in a parody of a recurring Family Guy in-joke that often sees Peter coming to blows with a giant chicken called Ernie. But the teaser also appeared to dash hopes of a series developing from the collaboration. When Lois remarks that 'this Springfield place seems nice, we should visit here again', Brian replies: 'I don’t know Lois, this looks like a one-shot deal.' Simpsons regulars Hank Azaria, Dan Castellenata, Yeardley Smith and Nancy Cartwright will feature in the special episode while Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, who voices Peter, as well as the usual Family Guy cast, will also star. Coming to blows: Homer and Peter's friendship breaks down into a full-scale superhero battle after they are turned into Incredible Hulk-style characters in a nuclear disaster at Springfield power plant . McFarlane has previously featured Homer, Marge and various other Simpson’s characters in Family Guy, amongst them The Juice is Loose, a 2009 episode in which Peter befriends another Simpson – O.J. Dan Castellanata – who voices Homer – also gave a one-liner in a 2012 episode of the show, with MacFarlane making an appearance in The Simpsons last May. Family Guy has also taken good-natured swipes at the blocky animation used in early episodes of The Simpsons, which originally launched in 1989. The Simpsons Guy will premiere on Fox in the U.S. on September 28.","Griffin family journey to Springfield from Quahog to meet Homer and co .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Vladimir Putin would welcome Scottish independence because it would weaken Britain, the outspoken Education Secretary Michael Gove has claimed. Mr Gove said a break up of the United Kingdom would put Russia in a 'stronger position' to dictate to the world. He claimed Britain was the 'second principal beacon of liberty' in the world and its break up would weaken the West. Education Secretary Michael Gove said Britain was the 'second principal beacon of liberty' in the world and Scottish independence would leave it weakened . The Tory Cabinet minister, who was born in Edinburgh and raised in Aberdeen, said a 'Yes' to independence vote would be cheered among Britain's enemies. Mr Gove, speaking during a debate on independence at the Chalke Valley History Festival yesterday, also attacked independence campaigners for portraying England as a 'loads'a money' nation which was 'meaner' than Scotland. The Education Secretary's controversial remarks come after Alex Salmond sparked controversy after declaring that he admired 'certain aspects' of Mr Putin's leadership. Mr Salmond's comments came at the height of the crisis over Russia's annexation of Crimea. The First Minister said during an interview in March that it was a 'good thing' Mr Putin had restored Russian pride. But the Tory MP said: 'Think globally. Think what would happen if Scotland and England broke up. Do we think that Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin would think 'oh that's a pity?' 'Or do you think he would think: 'Ah look, the second principal beacon of liberty in the world is a little more unstable. That plinth has been broken. I'm in a stronger position to do what I want'? 'Similarly, if we think of all of those across the globe who are against the principles of freedom and who might wish to cause us and our friends harm, would they regard the break up of the United Kingdom as a welcome weakening in the West's defences? Of course they would.' Mr Gove also attacked the SNP's attempt to play England and Scotland off against each other. He said: 'There's one thing that the Yes vote - the independent vote - campaigners in Scotland are saying. They're saying that England is somehow a different country. A narrower and a meaner country than Scotland. 'They're basically trying to say that England is a ""loads'a money' country, and Scotland a warmer place"". SNP leader Alex Salmond sparked controversy earlier this year after admitting there were 'some aspects' of Vladimir Putin's leadership that he admired . A Yes Scotland spokesperson said Mr Gove was guilty of 'hyperbole' and likened his remarks to Labour peer Lord Robertson, the former Nato general secretary, who said independence would be 'cataclysmic' for the world. The spokesman said: 'This hyperbole from Michael Gove is no less embarrassing to the No campaign. Scotland will be a valued friend and ally of the rest of the UK and western world, just like a myriad of other independent European nations. 'It is Michael Gove's Tory government which has been caught out trying to enlist Putin's support to oppose Scottish independence - just as they have been going round the world briefing against Scotland.'","Education Secretary says 'Yes'  vote would be cheered in Moscow .

"By . Sarah Vine . Have you seen Kylie Minogue's video/single, Sexercise? It is one of the most unintentionally comical things I have seen in a long while. It's all rather steamy, but in the most absurdly contrived way imaginable. I mean, honestly: who works out in 8in Louboutins? And balance balls have many uses, but I've never seen them as sex aids. Time efficient way to get fit: Sarah has discovered HIIT . The title probably tells you all you need to know. It's about sex as exercise, you see. Or perhaps it's the other way round. Either way, there's a lot of pert bottoms. The director, Will Davidson, has expressed his intention to 'take the viewer on a voyeuristic journey' that he hopes 'will no doubt see gym memberships soar'. Really? If there's one thing guaranteed to make me never set foot in a gym ever again it's the prospect of being surrounded by nubile Kylies writhing around on yoga mats. But the good news is that for, shall we say, rather exercise-averse ladies like me, it's perfectly possible to get fit without going anywhere near a gym. You just need to get into high intensity interval training. No more slogging it out for endless boring hours on the treadmill. High intensity interval training (aka HIIT) is the modern way to keep fit, a flexible, versatile method of exercise that needn't cost a penny and that pretty much anyone can do. Sexercise: Kylie looks nimble on an exercise ball in her new video . And it's got even me, lazy-pants extraordinaire, hooked. Essentially, it's all about short, sharp bursts of intense exercise, alternated with rest (I do so love a rest, don't you?). It's ideal for the time-pressed - or for those who are easily bored by physical jerks. Best of all, you can do it anywhere: in the park, your garden, you can even incorporate it into your daily commute - for example, running hell for leather up the stairs at work a few times a day or getting off the bus a couple of stops earlier and walking as fast as you can. Cycling, running, skipping, swimming - all can be adapted to HIIT, and it doesn't require any equipment. The key thing is to push yourself to the absolute limit, for short bursts of time, then have a nice long sitdown. The roots of this approach lie with Dr Izumi Tabata, whose work with the Japanese Olympic speed-skating team in the Nineties led him to conclude that short bursts of very high intensity activity produced better results than long hours of more moderate training. But it wasn't until relatively recently that these principles began to catch on. So, why am I recommending it so heartily for sloths like me? Well, I'm rather unnerved by the sudden approach of springtime and the dreaded day when I have to ditch the tights and show my bare legs. And HIIT works fast, fast enough to assassinate any winter chub. Studies have shown that 30-second bike sprints for a total of three minutes led to the same changes in muscle cells as two hours of long, steady bike riding. Essentially, it's about taking the body by surprise. The human body is annoyingly adaptable, constantly re-calibrating itself depending on your level of activity and eking out energy levels to meet demand. But if you really want to burn fat,  you need to run your metabolism ragged by constantly shifting the goal posts. That way it will use up more energy responding to demand - rather like over-revving an engine. Not all experts concur on how long the energy bursts should be. Professor Jamie Timmons at Loughborough University, for example, advocates a three-minute approach, 20 seconds flat-out of, say, sprinting, followed by a two-minute recovery of walking, repeated three times. At the start I used to run up and down the stairs at home, but I had to stop when the dog started chasing after me. Now I find a park bench does the trick for step-ups and tricep dips. I'm also told that star jumps are brilliant - though after two children they're slightly off the agenda. I've also taken to skipping with a rope, really fast. It might sound rather simple and a bit silly. But it's really not. The researchers at Loughborough found that HIIT improves insulin sensitivity, important for stabilising blood sugar. In this respect it's ideal for us middle-aged fatties, as it helps kick-start the metabolism. That said, do check with your doctor before you embark on HIIT, and I'd suggest starting off in the care of a qualified personal trainer who can make sure you don't end up in A&E. When I first did it, I got carried away and pulled a muscle. The person who taught me was Steve Mellor of Freedom2Train (freedom2train.com) and he has some excellent (and free) online tips at getthegloss.com. Michael Mosley, the man who got everyone hooked on the 5:2 diet, recently published a book about HIIT called Fast Fitness. There's even an App called Seven (iTunes) that puts you through your paces with a chair and your own body weight - and not a Kylie in sight. Secret weapon: Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronzer . Bronzer is the most abused and misused item in the beauty cupboard. And yet, done properly, it's also one of the most effective. As the weather slowly improves and our thoughts turn to balmy evenings with the odd glass of rosé, the temptation to fake a glow can seem irresistible. Sadly, the result is all too often less than successful. I know, because I've been there. Back in the late Eighties, when shoulder pads and batwings were all the rage, I happily tripped about the place looking an alarming shade of brick. Ultraglow was the thing back then, a russet-coloured powder that made the wearer look as if they'd fallen asleep face-first on a clay tennis court. Modern bronzers are a much less risky prospect. They come very finely milled for a super-sheer finish and, provided you know what you are doing, can impart instant fabulousness, in a just-stepped-off-a-yacht sort of a way. CRUSH...

I start by applying the darker shade underneath my cheekbones and chin, and blending. The result is a very subtle contouring effect, which works particularly well on my jawline. The highlighter goes anywhere else it's needed, including the decolletage. It's an investment piece, though. If you want a budget alternative, Soap & Glory's Solar Powder (£11) is an excellent choice. The quality of this is quite hard to believe at the price.

"By . Sarah Vine . Clothes shopping has never been anything but a chore for me. Ever since I can remember, I have been the wrong size. Even when I was 16 or 17 and at my slimmest, the High Street made me feel like a big fat freak. The only way to fit into the kind of clothes that were affordable and accessible, it seemed to me, was to eat next to nothing and exercise away every last calorie. But even then I never managed to get below a Miss Selfridge size 10-12. I’ve never been skinny enough for fashion. So, when High Street chain Mango announced, with great fanfare, that they were rolling out a plus-size range, I wasn’t particularly surprised when it turned out that their definition of ‘plus’ was a size 12. DRINKS OUTSilk dress, £295, bymarlenebirger.com.Heels, £30, NextThis dress feels amazing on (it’s wonderful quality), and the graphic design makes me feel like I’m at the opening of some terribly cool art gallery. It is a bit shapeless, though.SCORE: 5/10 . Perhaps it might be in other far-flung countries where retailers outsource their manufacturing to, but in the UK a size 12 is definitely not plus. You can’t blame it all on Mango. The truth is that fashion has never loved women’s bodies. From safety-pin dresses to hot pants, 95 per cent of fashion is designed to suit approximately 20 per cent of the population. But those of us who don’t conform to the fashion world’s minute proportions still have to buy clothes. So, how can women who are a little on the generous side go shopping without having a nervous breakdown? After decades of trying-on, many tears, and the odd triumph, here is my guide to conquering the High Street — and my pick of the best outfits big girls can buy today. The first step is acceptance. For years, I used to go shopping hoping in vain that somehow, overnight, I might have dropped a dress size. This never happens. And so, my first rule is this: always take a size bigger than you need into the changing room. There is nothing more demoralising than having to ask the attendant for a larger size. Asking for a size down, however, is FANTASTIC. Better still is popping out of the changing room, doing a quick twirl — and hearing her opine that something is too big. ‘Do you really think so?’ you can say, all wide-eyed and innocent, while internally punching the air with sheer unadulterated joy. SHOPPING TRIPJacket, £59, Collection at M&S.Vest, £85, leggings, £115, Eileen Fisher at fenwick.co.uk. Heels, £30, NextThis outfit makes me feel incredibly chic and a little bit French — which really is all I’ve ever wanted in life.SCORE: 10/10 . The second rule is this: make an effort. You are going to have to take your clothes off, and if you’re faced with the same pair of baggy grey pants and ineffective bra every time you strip down, you are going to hate yourself. Wear your best bra, decent heels and a slip — something confidence-boosting that will also protect your modesty — and a bit of make-up. It’s not a fashion show, I know, but it’s all about confidence. One of the difficulties of being plus size is that you can be so grateful if something — anything — fits, you end up buying all kinds of hideous rubbish. So remember: you don’t HAVE to buy anything, even if you are shopping for a special occasion. There’s always bound to be something tried and tested at home you can spruce up. Know your limitations. I know that if I’m in tears, it’s time to stop, have a cup of tea (or hell, perhaps something stronger) and then head to the accessories department. A scarf, a pair of earrings, new shoes — all are as good as a new outfit. If it’s been a particularly demoralising trip, I sometimes end up with a new handbag. I have a lot of bags. LUNCH WITH FRIENDSDress, £59, Mary Portas at House Of Fraser.Shoes, £35, NextI fear this one feels rather better than it looks — but it’s so comfortable I’m not sure I care. The shoes look far more expensive than they really are. They’re gorgeous.          SCORE: 7/10 . Wherever possible, shop alone. You might think it will be more fun with a friend, but whenever I shop with a pal, I just end up picking things out for her. That’s because most of my friends are slimmer than me, and therefore much easier to dress. Shopping with my mother, who is a size 8 and essentially a different species, is a disaster. If you’ve ever watched Miranda, you’ll get the picture. If things get really tough, there’s always the internet. People bemoan the demise of the British High Street; I say it deserves everything it gets. All those tiny changing rooms and bitchy sales assistants. The internet is the fat girl’s revenge. You can order your clothes and try them in the privacy of your bedroom — with no one but the dog to witness your upper arm shame. M&S’s changing rooms are possibly the least pleasant in the shopping universe. As for its underwear, there is too much choice. It’s confusing, and their sizing is sporadic. Fenwick is like Rigby & Peller (where the Queen buys her bras), only not as eye-wateringly expensive or quite so majestic. It has a great mix of everyday and fancy bras, including those by Wacoal, which are pretty and supportive of even the most impressive bust. For tights and hosiery, go to John Lewis for its own brand, which goes up to an XXL, and Pretty Polly’s Curves range. Try House of Fraser, too — Wolford’s Synergy Push Up Tights can work wonders. Debenhams is always a bit of a bun fight, but has a very good selection of shapewear. Best of all, though, is Bravissimo, which has stores across the country. BUSINESS MEETINGDress, £59, Mary Portas at House of Fraser. Jacket, £35, Collection at M&S. Heels, £40, NextA real surprise. I look a tiny bit mother-of-the-bride, but the structure of the jacket is great, and it balances out my shape nicely.      SCORE: 8/10 . Mary Portas for House Of Fraser can be a bit hit and miss, but when she gets it right, she really gets it right. This is mainly because her stuff always has decent length. Good old M&S can be great — although it does vary between their own labels. Autograph does wonderful casual-chic separates, and Per Una is well cut. John Lewis also stocks a great selection of brands that are kind to the midriff and thigh. Fenn Wright Manson and Hobbs are always good and Farhi by Nicole Farhi is expensive but will make you look and feel both rich and thin. For dresses, Eve Pollard (mother of Claudia Winkleman and Fleet Street veteran) has devised her own range designed for ‘grown-up women’. The reversible ones are especially useful (grayandosbourn.co.uk). They wash well, and are great on their own or with layering. DATE NIGHTDress, £395, anna scholz.com. T-bar heels, £28, NextBeautiful stretch silk. The neckline and sleeve length are flattering, and well within my comfort zone. I’d wear this time and again.      SCORE: 9/10 . One of the problems with most evening wear is that it’s often strapless or sleeveless, which means you end up faffing around with wraps and/or bolero jackets, which are loathsome. Nothing screams ‘I’m hiding my bingo wings’ more than a bolero jacket. If money is no object, head straight to Anna Scholz, whose clever, on-trend designs have never failed me. Damsel In A Dress, which you can find at John Lewis, does amazing draped jersey dresses, which add a Jessica Rabbit edge to your extra inches. And Phase Eight and Coast are both brilliant at dressing curves. Rather more unexpected is Barbara Hulanicki for George at Asda. This is a poor woman’s Biba — albeit, in my view, infinitely more wearable than the new Biba range, which only seems to want to cater for women without hips. I bought a chiffon and lace shirt for £18 there recently, wore it to a lavish political fundraiser with palazzo pants and heels — and two people complimented me on it. In a room full of Prada! Choose carefully, and you can bag treasures at supermarket prices.","Sarah Vine shares tips for those 'never skinny enough for fashion'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Hundreds of children under the age of 10 are being stopped and searched by police, a Commons report has revealed. The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children found over the last five years 1,136 stop and searches were carried out on under 10s - despite being under the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales. Over the same period, more than one million stop and searches were carried out on children and young people under the age of 18 across 26 forces. The police have come under fire for using stop and search powers too often. The Home Secretary Theresa May earlier this year slammed the Police Federation for not reforming its behaviour . This accounts for up to 26 per cent of all stop and searches done by the forces. The report said the figures collected suggested that stop and search was used 'disproportionately' on black and ethnic minority children and young people. It found that of the 43 forces which provided data for the inquiry, 20 had no separate custody facilities for children and young people - which may mean they could be held alongside adults, potentially exposing them to harm and distress. The all-party group chair, Baroness Massey, said: 'We were surprised to find that despite the fact so many children are being stopped and searched by the police there is no practice guidance to inform how to deal with children, particularly those who are young or vulnerable. 'Many of these children will be in need of care and protection, possibly fleeing from sexual predators or gang violence. 'The police need to make sure that they don't see children as small adults and do more to ensure they always adopt an age appropriate response to every child.' Theresa May warned rank and file police officers the way they used stop and search powers was unacceptable . Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau, said the findings showed the need for a new approach by police when dealing with young people. He said: 'Any child who comes into contact with the police should always be treated differently from an adult. 'For children who are at risk of exploitation, abuse or violence it is particularly important that the police know what steps to take to protect them and put their welfare first.' Commander Adrian Hanstock, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on stop and search, admitted a lot of youngsters were being stopped. He said: 'The reality is that young adults are disproportionately represented as both victims of crime and offenders. 'A recording error that gave the person a default age of zero when no address was entered has led to an inaccurate figure of children under 10 years old who were allegedly searched. 'In the genuine cases, children are often stopped because of intelligence that they are being exploited by adults, including gang members, to carry drugs, weapons or get involved in other criminal activity.' Commander Hanstock said the police would consider the recommendations published today by the all-party group to ensure they were only stopping children and young people when they needed to and that they were dealt with sensitively and appropriately.","Over the last 5 years 1,136 stop and searches were carried out on under 10s .

"By . Sarah Vine . Sex And The City is to blame, in my opinion. Until Carrie and her cohort of fashion-obsessed, Cosmopolitan-drinking New York girlfriends burst on the scene at the end of the Nineties, most of us had never even heard of a mani-pedi. My definition of grooming was a quick once-over with a razor and a session with Jolen cream bleach. My best friend and I used to wander around our shared flat with our white moustaches, singing Jolene into our hairbrushes in an exaggerated Dolly Parton voice. The idea of 'professional' beauty treatments was alien to us - the sort of thing only the starriest of the starry had the time and money for. Boudoir secrets: Home treatments give you the freedom to be yourself . There was a certain cachet in being low-maintenance, too. My generation defined itself as clever, not beautiful. I was considered positively daffy for having the occasional Decleor facial (still one of the best). Most girls my age did their hair and nails at home, not least because there were no such thing as blow-dry bars and High Street manicurists back then. Now, of course, they are everywhere. Even in times of economic hardship, women will still find a spare £5 for a file and polish. It’s the 21st-century equivalent of the so-called lipstick effect: a little bit of luxury that goes a long way to lifting the spirits. If all this seems a little extravagant to my generation, my mother's lot find it positively baffling. Sixties and Seventies beauties - Joanna Lumley, Helen Mirren etc - kept their beauty regimes close to their chests. The boudoir was a place of privacy and secrets. The name of the game was DIY. In fact, to this day Lumley continues to dye her own hair blonde - and try as I might I cannot get my own mother to give up her henna. In some ways, though, there has never been a better time to embrace DIY beauty. After the crash of 2008, the beauty industry turned its attention to developing more cost-effective products for domestic use, with interesting results. Last year, L'Oreal launched the first ever re-usable permanent hair colour, Mousse Absolue (£10.99 from Boots). Clever new packaging does all the donkey work for you, mixing the dye with the activator and delivering it in a light, non-drip mousse. Unlike traditional home dyes, which have to be thrown out after use, you can keep this in the bathroom and use it to touch up roots. If you like to err on the natural side of things, Naturtint (£9.99 from Holland & Barrett) is ammonia, resorcinol and paraben-free but still robust enough to cover greys. It comes in more than 30 shades, including some rich Duchess-of-Cambridge-style browns. When we're not fiddling with the hair on our heads, we are trying to get rid of the stuff on our bodies. I loathe salon waxing - what with the smell of the wax, the gruesomeness of the paper thong and having to make conversation with a total stranger in the most awkward of situations. I'm not sure the perfect home solution has yet been invented. The closest I've got is something along the lines of the Remington Cordless Body & Bikini Kit (£29.99, Boots). You'll never get a salon finish, but it will keep things tidy without too much fuss. For brows and facial hair, salon threading has been a revolution. But unless you know what you’re doing, I wouldn't recommend trying to shape your own eyebrows. There is, though, a brilliant new way of removing unwanted facial hair at home: the Tweezy (£10, victoriahealth.com). This canny little device consists of a metal spring and a rubber grip handle so you can just twist off excess hair from the root-like threading. It's incredibly effective and simple to use, and will save you a fortune in waxing. Thus, tweaked and trimmed, and in view of the slightly cheerier weather, you may want to consider adding a bit of a glow. Salon-tanning is big business, but it is a lot easier (and cheaper) to do it at home. The choice of brand is entirely up to you; but the secret to a successful, streak-free fake tan is the humble tanning mitt: St Tropez makes one of the best  (£5, from boots.com). Timeless: Joan Collins has released a beauty range . If you really want to know how to do good make-up, just ask a thespian. All actresses - famous or otherwise - do their own make-up. It doesn't matter whether you're the star of the show or a mere walk-on: you're all backstage together, fixing your faces. Strange, then, that there aren't more actresses in the beauty business. I suppose Estee Lauder had Elizabeth Hurley, but I'm not quite sure the term 'actress' is the correct one to describe her talents. Elizabeth Taylor had her own fragrance; indeed White Diamonds, which launched in 1991, is still a bestseller. But apart from the occasional brand ambassadorship, few actresses have actually devised and endorsed their own make-up range. Enter Joan Collins, who yesterday made her QVC debut selling her new Timeless Beauty Collection. Given her age (80) and her appearance (fabulous), it's an appropriate name. I've seen Collins up close, too, and the effect is really quite enchanting, especially her skin, which is amazing. CRUSH... Balance Me Stellar Beauty Balm (£18) If your skin hasn’t yet got over winter, try a pot of this multi-purpose salve for some skin TLC. FAIL... Liza Minnelli . Liza, we love you. But you must promise that you will never again leave the house without wearing a bra. Unlike many famous actresses of her . generation, she has resisted the temptation to over-work her face in the . manner of, say, poor Kim Novak, who is virtually unrecognisable. Joan . has aged well: she's not trying to recapture or preserve in aspic her . youthful beauty, but she does know how to make the most of what she . still has: those eyes, the famous lips, the exquisite bone structure. The look of the range is very Joan: dark eyes and vivid lips:  this collection is certainly not for wallflowers. Each lipstick is named after a Collins character, from Fontaine, a hot pink named after her alter ego in The Stud, to a rich burgundy courtesy of her other famous incarnation, the wicked Alexis (boo, hiss) in Dynasty. The quality, as you would expect, is classy, with plenty of gold casing reminiscent of old-school Estee Lauder. The range itself, then, is very much in her image, i.e. results-based and designed to flatter. For me, the stand-out item is the Compact Duo, which contains a soft, very fine powder and is cleverly designed to incorporate a lipstick in the lid. The eyeshadows are great, too: complimentary quads of colour so that you can vamp your look up or down according to preference. My only real criticism is that I would have called it simply 'Joan'. After all, when you're a legend, surnames are superfluous.","There has never been a better time to embrace DIY beauty .

"By . Sarah Vine . Every time I see a picture of Helen Mirren, it gladdens my heart. There she is at a premiere, surrounded by women half her age and with twice as many stylists, and she looks better than the lot of them. Better than Angelina (too thin), better than Gwynnie (too vanilla), better than Cara Delevingne or Kate Moss, women who make a living out of being beautiful. What makes Helen so standout special is that she has an honest kind of beauty. She’s not trying too hard (Kim Kardashian), she’s sexy without being porny (Beyonce), she doesn’t have any weird affectations, such as Victoria Beckham’s pout or Anna Wintour’s fringe, and her smile always seems to reach her eyes. Most notably, though, at 68 she is an example of how a mature woman can continue to turn heads long after her official sell-by date. If anything, she looks better now that she did in her theoretical prime. Sarah Vine gives you her top tips on how to make your beauty regime turn you into Helen Mirren . And that’s because, contrary to what the magazines and ad agencies would have you believe, attractiveness has little to do with perfection. All those hard-bodied, no-dairy, no-wheat, no meat, no-fun, fitness fascists aren’t beautiful, they’re just annoying — and extremely hungry. Beauty is not about flawless skin or the perfect flat stomach. It’s holistic: a combination of style, confidence, personality, diet, decent genes, a good hairdresser and, of course, products. Products are always a bit controversial for the older woman. Most women Mirren’s age, including my mother, think that my generation waste far too much money on lotions, potions and treatments. It’s because they’re war babies; a pot of Pond’s is pushing the boat out for them. Even if my mother could have afforded Creme de La Mer, she wouldn’t have bought it on principle. She was the kind of person who melted down her old lipsticks. So, with the ghost of all our mothers looking disapprovingly over their reading specs, I have chosen carefully when selecting my ultimate products for women over 50. Look no further ladies, this is all you need: . First is an all-time favourite of mine, Liz Earle’s Superskin Concentrate: (£40) 100 per cent natural, a blend of rosehip, argan, neroli and vitamin E. It is nectar for older, dehydrated skins, and it smells like nectar, too. It’s best used at night, last thing before bed after a nice hot bath or shower. Warm a few drops between the palms of your hands, inhale the soothing scent and press it gently into your skin. Co-enzyme Q10 (£12.92) is also one for mature ladies to watch out for. A powerful antioxidant that is naturally present in the body, it plays a key role in cell regeneration. I have a theory about wrinkles: horizontal lines, good; vertical lines, bad. Horizontal lines come from laughing and squinting at the sun. Vertical lines, the ones you get between your eyes and around the mouth, give you what’s known as ‘bitchy resting face’ (that’s a technical term). Not good. What makes Helen Mirren so standout special is that she has an honest kind of beauty . And so onto my next product, Vichy’s Liftactiv Advanced Filler (£31, Boots). It contains the highest non-prescription levels of pure retinol, which is clinically proven to soften so-called ‘dynamic’ wrinkles (those generated by repeated muscle movement rather than ageing). Unlike most retinoids, this one is moisturising and suitable even for sensitive skins. Every older woman should also pick up No 7’s Restore and Renew Day and Night Serum (£24.99), which is specifically designed for the over-60s. It aims to treat lines, lack of firmness, uneven pigmentation, fragility and dullness, and the ingredients are clinically proven. And a cracking new all-rounder is Kiehl’s Super Multi Corrective Cream (£48). They’ve thrown the kitchen sink at this one, with ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and beech tree extract, and the result is a highly effective, comforting treatment that improves the feel and look of older skins. Aside from the face, the one area that you need to keep an eye on as the years roll by is the decolletage. Nothing is more annoying than a wrinkly cleavage. UV rays are the real culprit, so Dr Ceuticals Neck and Chest Lift (£19.90, Boots) is ideal because it contains an SPF of 15 as well as tried and tested ingredients to improve skin elasticity and hydration. Make-up wise, less is always more when you are over 50. You want light, translucent products that glide on and don’t get absorbed by thirsty skin. Armani’s Maestro Fusion Make-up (£39) combines effective coverage with a gossamer-like texture. You should also brighten and freshen up the eye area with a good illuminator: Guerlain’s Precious Light (£30.50) would be my choice. It’s a wonder product. Guerlain would also be my suggestion for a bronzer — it’s one of the few cosmetics where you really do get what you pay for. The Terracotta Four Seasons palette (£47) works all year round to add just a bit of pizzazz to dull skin. Keep eyeshadow simple and clean: use soft golden pinks to flatter skin tone, and blend and blur as much as you can for a nice soft finish. No7’s Shade and Define pencils (£8) are perfect, and they come in a good choice of neutral shades. For lips, avoid highly pigmented lipsticks: they can look very harsh and unforgiving. Add a bit of Vaseline (£2.18) to your favourite lipstick for a fresher look and invest in Lipstick Queen’s colourless lip liner (£18), which will stop colour bleeding. Lastly, if you dye your grey hair, get down to Marks & Spencer for colourist-to-the-stars Josh Wood’s innovative Blending Wand (£12.50). It’s indispensable between visits to the hairdresser. It’s foundation for hair: you paint on the colour and those pesky roots vanish in a flash. Sisley's Eau de Soir . Sisley’s Eau de Soir (£78.50, John Lewis). My favourite. It’s gorgeous, warm and  glamorous without being overpowering. Caron’s . French Cancan. A soft, seductive woody floral, first formulated in . 1936. Order a sample for £3.50 from lessenteurs.co.uk (020 7730 2322). Chanel . Cuire de Russie (from £110). Created in 1927 by Coco following an . encounter with a dashing Russian. Dark, daring and dangerous. Creed Fleurs de Gardenia (from £95, Les Senteurs, as above). Like falling head first into a spring bouquet. Annick Goutal Eau D’Hadrien (from £60, House of Fraser). Fizzy, fresh citrus with a cypress base. A lovely,  go-anywhere scent. Actresses Jane Seymour, 63, and Jacqueline Bisset, 69, have voiced their disapproval of Botox, saying they would never consider it as a way of staving off old age. ‘As an actress, this is my canvas,’ says Seymour. ‘I stay away from Botox and all these things because I need my wrinkles.’ Hmm. Anyway, a few years ago I would have been in complete agreement with them. Until very recently, pretty much anyone who had Botox just ended up really weird and shiny. Parts of Liverpool, London and LA were starting to look like that episode of Doctor Who when the mannequins come to life and try to take over the world. Then came the killer blow: Jordan had it live on telly. A backlash was inevitable. Thing is, Botox — used correctly and judiciously — is actually rather brilliant. The effects can be subtle, but extremely effective. Nicole Kidman used to have botox treatments in the past . The real issue is that though Botox is a prescription drug, anyone can administer it. There are people offering Botox who have no more knowledge or understanding of the way the facial muscles work and interact with each other than the postman. This is something that irks not just Botox’s critics, but also those responsible practitioners who know what they’re doing. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons has been banging the legislation drum for years, pleading for the Government to make it impossible for anyone except a qualified medical professional to administer the substance. And still they resist. This month’s report on proposals to regulate the cosmetic surgery industry (following the PIP implant scandal) was about as much use as a chocolate teapot. I am lucky: my job gives me access to the best in the business — the likes of Dr Vicky Dondos, Dr Terry Loong and Dr Frances Prenna Jones. I have Botox to try to reduce the size of my jaw muscles which, after years of tooth-grinding, are so over-developed they’re starting to alter the shape of my face. It’s subtle, and it works. And it’s not the root of all evil. SHEALd Recovery Balm (£43, victoria health.com)This all-purpose balm is a godsend for older, compromised skins that are especially prone to scarring and splitting. Medicine cabinet or bedside table? Up to you. Al PacinoI yield to no one in my admiration for Al Pacino. But look: he’s orange! Perhaps he’s been taking style tips from Simon Cowell.

"By . Sarah Vine . At this time of year, my skin is as grey as the rain-leaden skies. Halloween has come and gone, leaving me with a deathly pallor and ghoulish under-eye bags. This is the season when a good facial really can make all the difference. I want to recapture that lost summer glow. I want my eye bags to melt away. I want my face to be de-puffed - in short, I want to get back the will to live. I'm not looking to be pampered, just for down-and-dirty instant gratification. DNA facials: No-fuss Debbie Thomas is 'all about the results' There is only one place to go. The place where I return year after year, like a slightly weather-beaten homing pigeon. Up a rather dingy flight of stairs, past magazine racks stuffed with browning back-copies of Hello! and whingeing hairdresser's assistants, past the tiny toilet - and into the three-room skincare empire of Debbie Thomas. Thomas doesn't have much time for small-talk. It's 8.15am, and I'm the first client of her day, a day that won't end until gone 9pm. She doesn't bother much with glamour, either. No scented candles or wafty whale music in her treatment rooms, just an array of serious-looking machinery, winking ominously in the wintry gloom. Sarah Vine: 'She shrunk my chins!' Her hair is tied tightly back, her sleeves are rolled up and she's scrubbing her hands. Do I need to remove my top? 'Up to you,' she says, as she flicks a few switches and the machines hum into life. 'Ready?' And off we go. Thomas is what's known in the business as a 'superfacialist'. She's not here to make me feel good, to chat or to de-stress me. She is here to perform my annual skin MOT. She calls it her DNA facial, not because it contains any deoxyribonucleic acid, but because it goes to the core of each client's individual needs. She is, as she likes to remind me when I grimace at the sight of another torturous-looking contraption, 'all about the results'. Her knowledge is based on years of experience - she has worked with both Ole Henrikkson (the flamboyant former dancer-turned-LA-skin guru) and Dr Frances Prenna Jones (one of London's most trusted skin doctors). She knows what works and what doesn't, what’s harmless and what's not. And it's best not to argue with her. She begins with a Skinceuticals Gel Peel GL, which combines glycol and lactic acids to exfoliate, brighten and hydrate the skin, followed by targeted hydrodermabrasion (basically deep exfoliation using water), again to cleanse and hydrate. The next bit, however, is a little scary. Radio frequency for my jawline. My double chin and incipient jowls are one of the things that depress me most about my reflection. This treatment involves massaging the offending areas with a rather hot nozzle. This, apparently, zaps fatty deposits and tightens the skin. It's also quite uncomfortable - although not impossibly so. Afterwards, there's some lymph drainage using a funny little sucking device, then some extremely firm ('I don't do namby-pamby') and rather heavenly massage using a masque by a Swiss skincare brand called Valmont (www.evalmont.com). All that, and I'm still not done. Time for some red light therapy to stimulate cell regeneration, and then a final once-over with a Valmont serum and SPF cream. I sit up, slightly stunned. My skin is glowing. My eyes are bright. The shadows have gone. But best of all my double chin has shrunk. Reader, she shrunk my chins! Debbie Thomas is at Hari's, 020 7349 8722 . How do we know it's nearly Christmas? The rosy cheeks of the children as they play in the chill November air? The little robin redbreast busying himself in the garden? Or even the pre-order facility for the Playstation 4 at PC World? Nope. None of the above. It's the absolute cast-iron guarantee that, around about now, a bunch of half-naked women will start appearing on our screens, chained to snow leopards, snogging wolves or dragging their fingernails down the backs of unsuspecting male models while Alain Delon - or someone who sounds a lot like him - mutters inanities in a comedy French accent. A little bit of Genius: Scarlett Johansson and Matthew McConaughey . Yes, viewers: it's Christmas perfume ad season! Chanel has already brought out the big guns: they've got Marilyn Monroe, a wise back-to-basics move after last year's disastrous Brad Pitt venture. But look, here's Dolce & Gabbana, overtaking on the inside with an original short film directed by none other than Martin Scorsese. In moody black and white, and set in New York, it stars two of the most beautiful people on the planet, Matthew McConaughey and Scarlett Johansson. It's a little bit of genius, actually. Not only does it contain flashes of humour (not generally present in the world of haute perfumery), it has a perfectly plausible narrative - and at no point do either of the protagonists’ clothes accidentally fall off. Best of all, there are no endangered species, no women covered in gold paint wandering through the snow. And no smut. The closest they get to a clinch is holding hands. Does it reflect the fragrance itself? Mmm, not exactly. It's one of those rather banal, black-curranty affairs that fashion houses seem to favour at the moment, nothing special, and unlikely to become a classic. But the point of a designer fragrance is not what it smells like; it's what it stands for. Driving through New York in an open-top car with Matthew McConaughey? What more could a girl want for Christmas?","Debbie Thomas is what's known in the business as a 'superfacialist'

"By . Sarah Vine . Boxing Day: Alka- Seltzer, leftovers and bored children. That faint feeling of self-loathing that comes from having spent too much money on things you didn't need or want. The Christmas manicure that looked so witty is now tawdry and chipped by washing up. The unmistakeable throb of a nascent spot on your chin. Bloat. My solution is to banish husband and children to the nearest park/ multiplex/football game and embark on my annual post-festive purge. Sarah Vine brings you something to keep your carb-addled brains entertained: a reminder of all that was fabulous and/or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013. Behind the fridge, the oven, the cupboard under the sink: nothing will escape my rubber gloves and bleach. And if I'm feeling really brave, I'll slip into my bio-hazard suit and tackle my daughter's bedroom. A clean house equals a clear mind, and there's no better way to see in the New Year. That said, I do realise most people will think I'm mad. So, for those of you who will be spending today curled up on the sofa with the remnants of a family-sized box of Celebrations, here's something to keep your carb-addled brains entertained: a reminder of all that was fabulous and/or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013. The year began, as it so often does, with a new diet. Popularised by an episode of TV's Horizon and the Mail's hugely successful 2-Day Diet, it involved adopting a reduced calorie intake on two out of seven days. Miley Cyrus, pictured here at the Jingle Ball 2013, brought twerking to the mainstream, much to most of our dismay . The benefits are bountiful: lowered cholesterol, lower blood pressure, regulation of blood sugar, improved mental clarity, focus and concentration. Oh, and weight loss, which, let's face it, is all we really care about. Best of all, though, was the relative ease and simplicity of the thing. After all, everyone can stay off chocs for a day at a time; it's doing it for weeks on end that's hard. So, while we all bored each other senseless with details of our new regime, a truly terrible portrait of Kate Middleton was unveiled to provide a little light relief. Write caption here . Somehow artist Paul Emsley made our radiant Duchess look as if she'd been pulling night shifts in a dust factory. The royal couple were polite about it; not so the critics, who professed themselves truly impressed by the way Emsley had managed to turn one of the world's most beautiful women into an old bag. One for the vaults, I fear. At the Baftas in February, some men turned up in beards, causing a frenzy and eliciting endless column inches about the 'return of facial hair'. Granted, those men included George Clooney, Ben Affleck and Hugh Jackman; but 'man grows beard' is not exactly a new story. Meanwhile, Dame Helen Mirren dyed her hair pink, an uncharacteristic lapse of taste for which we have yet to receive an explanation. Nigella leaving court earlier this month - her immaculate makeup makes her Sarah Vine's beauty heroine of the year . Even more baffling was Cheryl Cole's decision to get an entire rosebush tattooed on her behind. But then Jesse J shaved her head, Katherine Jenkins ran a marathon in full make-up, Gwyneth Paltrow forgot to wear her pants at the Iron Man premiere and Kate Moss turned up to a party in not much more than her tights - and Cole's bottom rose seemed tame by comparison. Fad-wise, this year there were plenty. There was the vampire facial, involving blood and needles; teeth grilles (as worn by Rihanna and, less plausibly, Madonna); selfies (photographs of one's perfect body snapped in the mirror of from the perspective of the sun lounger); belfies (a selfie from behind); twerking; and extreme waxing, the latter two pioneered in eye-watering detail by pop star Miley Cyrus. Selfies (as demonstrated by Maria Fowler of TOWIE, left) and tattoos (right, Cheryl Cole's enormous rose artwork) were big celebrity trends of 2013 . As PREDICTED, Kate Middleton gave birth to a baby and then promptly alienated half the female population by 'snapping back' into shape. Luckily she redeemed herself a few weeks later by stepping out on an official visit with - gasp! - grey roots, which was either an act of PR genius or a genuine oversight. Either way, a triumph. The year ended on a beauty high: the release of make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury's new cosmetic range, which saw Selfridges' beauty hall mobbed by women desperate to get their hands on Kate Moss's lipstick and J-Lo's cheek-contouring palette. Not since the launch of Tom Ford's make-up line (which was also devised by Tilbury) have cosmetics been this exciting - and with one advantage: her eyeshadows don't cost £64. But for all Tilbury's genius, the beauty triumph of 2013 was Nigella Lawson's court face. From Helen Mirren's pink hair, to Madonna's ill-advised grilles, we bring you the best and worst of this year's beauty trends . Doubtless the experience of having her marital laundry aired in public was deeply unpleasant. But never has a woman looked so utterly fabulous under pressure. Let's not forget that before she became the queen of cupcakes, she wrote about beauty for a newspaper. If she ever tires of cooking, there's always lipstick. My prediction for 2014? A Nigella make-up line. Stranger things have happened.","Dame Helen Mirren dyed her hair pink, an uncharacteristic lapse of taste .

Google executive Forrest Tim Hayes had extramarital relations with girls besides Alix Tichelman before he died, and the captain of the yacht who discovered his body may have tampered with evidence, police said today. The body of the married father of five was discovered after he had been injected with heroin by call girl Tichelman – who then fled the scene – on November 23, but police say they have evidence he had also been seeing other women.

'The boat was in . pretty clean condition when we found it and we suspect he may have tried . to clean things up a bit. ‘He . did hinder the investigation initially, and it cost us a little bit of . time. I understand why he did it, he has a professional reputation, he . has high-end, wealthy clients, I’m sure he is paid well and part of that . payment is for his discretion,’ he added. The . captain also told police the main cabin camera, which allegedly showed . Tichelman failing to help Hayes after his overdose, calmly finishing her . glass of wine then collecting her things before leaving the scene, . wasn’t working. ‘The camera that was in the cabin and would show us what had happened - he told us it didn’t work,’ Clark said. Santa .

Other flings: Santa Cruz Deputy Chief of Police Steve Clark exclusively told MailOnline that Hayes  'had other liaisons' Tichelman, 26, is accused of heartlessly leaving a client to die from a drug overdose, . wrote about her 'love' of killing sprees in a Facebook post published . just days before her July 4 arrest. She appeared in Santa Cruz court on Wednesday to face . manslaughter and drug charges in connection to the November 2013 death . of Hayes, 51. Deputy Chief of Police Clark told MailOnline Clark that when she was arrested Tichelman was ‘shocked’ but started to reveal her ‘callous’ side during interview. He . added: ‘It was pretty clear that her self-centered nature came through . in this interview, as it did in her committing the crime as well. ‘She . has had contact with people on the outside who she has been encouraging . to remove her social media information. She’s still trying to cover her . tracks and cover evidence which might implicate her. ‘It’s . shocking from the perspective of how callous and uncaring she was. That . she could be so cold and not even cry out for help or call 911 or try . to revive him in any way, it shows the type of person and how egocentric . she was.’ Surveillance . footage obtained by investigators shows Tichelman injecting Hayes with . heroin, and then casually leaving him to die when he has an adverse . reaction to the drug. And this may not have been Tichelman's first killing, as detectives are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state. According to a report by Fox News, Tichelman had phoned up 911 and reported the heroin overdose death of  a man named Dean Riopelle. Police in Milton Georgia are taking another look at the case. In another case, according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel, Tichelman may have dated the lead singer of the Atlanta-based group, The Judies, Warren Ullom, who was sent  to prison for manslaughter for a heroin overdose. Stone cold: The high-priced prostitute didn't look worried when she appeared in court on July 9 . No plea yet: Tichelman has not yet entered a plea, and was assigned a public defender in court on Wednesday . Tichelman was apparently fascinated with the topic of serial murders, according to posts she wrote on Facebook just last month. 'Really . nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in . cold blood...and they love it too,' she wrote in a June 28 post. 'No judgement, Yay! F*** all of that positivity bulls***. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die,' she added. In court on Wednesday, Tichelman did not enter a plea and was assigned a public defender. Tichelman has been held on $1.5million bond since her July 4 arrest, when she met with an undercover cop at a Santa Cruz hotel who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. The high-priced prostitute allegedly met Hayes, the married father of five, on website 'Seeking Arrangement' which pairs 'sugar babies' with rich older men or women. Police say the two met a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter. That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said. Scene: She allegedly took the heroin to his yacht, pictured, and administered the drug but as he lay dying, she stepped over his body to finish a glass of wine before leaving the boat . Surveillance video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt to help him or call 911, police said. Instead, she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window blind down to conceal his body from outside. Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported. 'She showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday. Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim. Working girl: Tichelman was a high-price prostitute and met her clients, including Hayes, online . 'We know they've had a previous . relationship, they've shared time together before,' Clark told KION. 'This was all set up . through text messages and emails. We also know what she did in the . aftermath of this. We have her computer records, we know the Google . searches that she made, the things she did to try to get herself out of . this.' Fetish fan: Tichelman was arrested on Friday after police posed as a client and met her at a hotel . Police identified Tichelman from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said. They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County for the July 4 arrest. When asked if the overdose was accidental or intentional, Clark said evidence showed a level of guilt that reached second-degree murder rather than involuntary manslaughter, the Sentinel reported. 'She showed . absolutely no regard for this person she injected with heroin,' Clark . said. 'She had a responsibility to provide some lifesaving effort.' Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state. Hayes, . who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to . wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his . obituary. He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google. 'Forrest . will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than . anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on . his boat,' according to a January obituary. 'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.' Tichelman's . Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before . majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty . school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist . According to Tichelman's Facebook, she went to high school in Atlanta before attending George State University and then beauty school. She listed her occupation as a makeup artist . She called herself a 'model' in jail records. On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera, and posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of months ago. In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character. 'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an ""intense child"" and already liked horror movies.' She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her nightclub owner boyfriend. She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 'Dexter'. Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.","Alix Tichelman, 26, appeared in Santa Cruz court on Wednesday faces manslaughter charges .

As MPs prepare to vote tomorrow on plans to decriminalise non-payment, it emerged last night that growing numbers are taking advantage of a legal loophole. Any homeowner can legally remove the ‘implied right of access’ to their front doorstep, effectively threatening to sue licence fee collectors for trespass if they continue to visit. Around 7,00 homeowners have removed the 'implied right of access' to their front doorstep, allowing them to sue TV licence collectors if they continue to visit (file pic) Between February 2012 and January this year, 5,726 people contacted the BBC to do so, a Freedom of Information request has revealed. Up to December 2011, just 1,573 people . had withdrawn the right of access, so there has been a huge jump in the . past two years. In total, 7,299 households have now withdrawn access. Although they are officially named ‘enforcement officers’, TV Licensing staff – who are employed by private firm Capita on the BBC’s behalf – do not possess any official powers of arrest and cannot enter homes or search property without permission. The 334 staff make four million home visits a year to gather evidence of licence fee evasion, leading to around 180,000 prosecutions. However, homeowners have complained of being harassed even when they do not own a TV, while letters have been sent to the families of viewers who are long dead. Keira Knightley, 28, has said she was ‘hounded by TV licence people’ even though she did not own a TV. Under BBC policy, all requests to remove the right of access are honoured as enforcers would be trespassing if they kept visiting. Tomorrow’s debate will see MPs consider an amendment to the Deregulation Bill which would decriminalise non-payment of the fee in 2016. Downing Street has backed the plans, put forward by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen after a petition was signed by 150 MPs from each of the three main political parties. MPs are to vote tomorrow on whether to decriminalise non-payment. Last year 180,000 people went to court for the crime, and 70 ended up in jail . Last night Mr Bridgen said homeowners withdrawing access shows growing anger towards the BBC: ‘It is clear that a large proportion of the public resent the BBC’s heavy-handed way of collecting the fee.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The fact that increasing numbers are using their right to withdraw access to TV licensing officials is further evidence that the days of the licence fee appear increasingly numbered.’ A TV Licensing spokesman said it uses ‘other forms of detection’ when right of access is withdrawn. He said any complaints about staff are thoroughly investigated. BBC programmes could be blocked for those who don't pay the licence fee under new rules being considered . Ministers are thought to be considering plans to block access to BBC programmes for licence fee cheats. If laws are passed to decriminalise fee evasion, the corporation will seek new powers to enforce payment. Senior BBC officials have repeatedly warned that removing the threat of jail could see evasion rates rise by 5 per cent, leading to losses of around £200million a year. One way to stop fee dodgers would be to cut off TV signals from those who fail to pay, in the same way as Sky or Virgin subscribers lose access. Since the digital switchover, it is possible to encrypt TV programmes so they can only be watched through sets equipped with smart cards. However, the BBC claims it would be prohibitively expensive to upgrade set-top boxes around the country with the new technology. At present, most viewers watch BBC shows through Freeview boxes, which do not have such systems installed. BBC strategy chief James Purnell said: ‘We think the cost of running the subscription system would be greater than the licence fee system.’","Legal loophole allows licence fee dodgers to beat BBC enforcers .

"By . Matthew Blake . The former poster boy of America's so-called 'ex-gay' movement who last year left his wife to return to homosexuality has launched a scathing attack on Rick Perry, declaring: 'You don’t understand this issue at all'. John Paulk - once the nation's leading advocate of so-called gay conversion therapy - issued the verbal assault after the Texas governor compared homosexuality to alcoholism in an interview earlier this month. Perry was forced to apologise after he suggested that a gay person in a same-sex relationship is no different to an alcoholic who chooses to drink. Scroll down for video . You don't get it: John Paulk (left) - once America's leading advocate of so-called gay conversion therapy - launched the attack after Texas governor Rick Perry (right) compared homosexuality to alcoholism earlier this month . 'Whether or not you feel compelled to follow a particular lifestyle or not, you have the ability to decide not to do that,' Perry told The San Francisco Chronicle. 'I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way.' Now Paulk, from Portland, Oregon, hit out at the politician in a comment feature for Politico Magazine. 'This wasn’t just some political mistake,' writes Paulk. 'What worries me more is the ignorance betrayed by Perry’s comments - an ignorance that I believe is still widespread among conservatives in the straight world - about what being gay means.' Sparking controversy: Perry's original comments came during a conversation about 'reparative therapy' that Texas Republicans formally endorsed in their party platform this week. 'Gay for Life?' Paulk became such a well-known figure in the 'ex-gay movement' that he even appeared on the front cover of Newsweek magazine in 1998 alongside wife Anne beneath the headline, 'Gay for Life?' Perry’s . original comments came during a conversation about 'reparative therapy' that Texas Republicans formally endorsed in their party platform this . week. Practitioners . of the controversial treatment - also called 'gay conversion therapy' - . claim to be able to turn homosexuals straight with a variety of . techniques that critics argue are both psychologically damaging and . ineffective. Techniques . include electric shock therapy, inducing nausea . while being exposed to homoerotic material, praying, exorcism, trips to . brothels to have sex with women and hypnosis. The wife: Paulk became 'straight' in 1990s, married Anne (pictured), a former lesbian and had three children with her . But Paulk has now completely abandoned the movement, vowing instead to fight the 'widespread misunderstanding in the straight world' that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice. 'I do not want young gay women and men today to go through what I went through,' he writes. 'I want to tell them - and Rick Perry: We are not broken, damaged, inferior or throwaways. We are created in the image of God - just like everyone else.' Of his own past, he writes: 'I was in denial. It wasn’t . in fact true, any of it. Worse than being wrong, it was harmful to many . people - and caused me years of pain in my own life. Which is why I . have this to say to the Rick Perrys of the world: You don’t understand . this issue. At all.' During . the 1990s, Paulk became the most visible proponent of 'reparative . therapy' claiming it had 'healed' him, allowing him to marry Anne and have three children. He . became such a well-known figure in the 'ex-gay movement' that he even . appeared on the front cover of Newsweek magazine in 1998 alongside wife . Ann. But last year, he revealed that he was in fact gay after all and had left the movement. 'My . beliefs have changed,’ he told PQ Monthly, which stands for Proud . Queer. 'Today, I do not consider myself “ex-gay” and I no longer support . or promote the movement.' It . was a huge departure from Paulk’s prime ex-gay days, when he founded . and ran a ministry called Love Won Out based on ‘reparative therapy.’ Paulk . also penned two books on the subject: Not Afraid To Change: The . Remarkable Story Of How One Man Overcame Homosexuality and Love Won Out, . which he wrote with his wife, who also claimed to have rid herself of . her own homosexuality. He wrote the piece after the Texas Republican party revealed they are now endorsing so called restorative therapy to 'cure' homosexuality. Change of mind: Mr Paulk, right, is pictured in drag for a 1990s photoshoot after his conversion from gay to straight . 'Reparative therapy is, by definition, based on the notion that something . is “broken” in one’s identity, needing repair,' he writes. 'You are meant to feel . like damaged goods, and the therapy is designed to fix that.' He goes on: 'In a . nutshell, gay conversion advocates argue that boys who grow up to be gay . over-identify with their mothers and remain detached from uninvolved, . weak, passive, disinterested fathers.' Treatments for 'curing' homosexuality claim to change a person's sexuality through techniques such as electric shock therapy, inducing nausea while being exposed to homoerotic material, praying, exorcism, trips to brothels to have sex with women, and hypnosis. Some advocates of the therapy have also asserted that prayer and religious faith can be helpful in suppressing or overcoming same-sex attractions. The American Psychological Association have warned that the therapies run the risk of causing serious psychological harm. Gay rights groups agree saying the therapy damages young people, because it tells them that it's not acceptable to be whoever they are. The largest Christian ministry engaged in such work, Exodus International, also closed last year and its leader apologised to the gay community for inflicting 'years of undue suffering.' California and New Jersey have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youth straight, and both laws have been upheld in court. 'I was told by my Christian mentor that one thing I needed to do to increase my sense of masculinity was to quit my job as a chocolatier because I was surrounded by too many women,' he writes. 'My mentor suggested I get a job in the business world where there were more men.' He remained at the forefront of the ex-gay movement until September of 2000, when he was photographed in a Washington DC gay bar. By 2012 he could not live the lie any longer. 'I deeply loved my wife, Anne, who still believed in the movement, and I knew it would be extremely scandalous to embrace homosexuality after the career I’d had,' he writes. 'But it was more and more apparent to me that I was what I always had been: gay.' In the end he decided to abandon his old life and 'come out' for a second time. 'Today, for the first time since I was a young man, I’m not living a double life - a life that is a lie, day in and day out. I have no more secrets than the next person,' he adds. Paulk now supports himself . in the food service industry, running a catering company in Portland, . Oregon called Mezzaluna Catering, and says he no longer profits from his . former job. At their annual conference in Fort Worth on Saturday, the Texan Republican party adopted the policy of 'reparative therapy', which tea party groups had advocated. One . particularly influential group, the Texas Eagle Forum, had urged the . party to support the psychological treatments, which claim to try and . turn homosexuals straight. President of the conservative group, Texas Values Jonathan Saenz welcomed the decision saying it comes as no surprise. He . explained: 'The platform reflects what the people in the Republican . Party have asked for, and that should be no surprise: family values, . protection of marriage between one man and one woman and everything that . goes along with that.' But . adopting the policy has sparked controversy even amongst members of the . Republican party, some of whom had been lined up to speak out against . endorsing such therapy. They never got the chance to address delegates, because a parliamentary motion to approve the full platform was called first. Rudy . Oeftering, vice president of the gay conservative group Metroplex . Republicans, who was due to speak said: 'There's a very, very small . group of people who want to keep the party in the past. We were here . today to try to pull the party into the future. 'The only . way the party can go into the future is to start listening to young . people, to start listening to people who have gay family members.'","John Paulk was once America's leading advocate of gay conversion therapy .

"By . Richard Spillett . A father-of-one took his own life amid worries that he was due to be visited by bailiffs over an unpaid £600 council tax bill, an inquest into his death has heard. Bar manger Aran Waite, 23,  had spoken of 'never having the money to do anything' and could have acted on the spur of the moment, his girlfriend told the hearing. His heartbroken family have now urged young people to speak about their problems rather than 'bottling them up'. Mr Waite was found dead at his home in Blackpool, Lancashire, by his girlfriend Naomi Booth, 24, in May. He had earlier left his partner in a nightclub and sent her a text 'out of the blue' at around 2am. Scroll down for video . Father-of-one Aran Waite, pictured with girlfriend Naomi Booth and daughter, Tulisa, took his own life in May . Giving evidence at an inquest in his death, Ms Booth, mother to the couple's three-year-old daughter Tulisa, said: 'He had seemed normal and was talking to everyone. He kept telling me to stay out and said he wanted to go home. 'Just after 2 o'clock I got a text off him but didn't see it until half an hour later. He said he had been thinking about it for a while and it was time to say goodnight. He said ""don't let Tulisa forget me"" and said he loved us. 'I had never received anything like that from him before.' Aran - who was manager of a bar on Blackpool promenade - had been worried about his financial affairs due to council tax debts, the inquest heard. But his father said a £100 per month repayment plan was being agreed with the local council for the bill, leaving him with no idea what had driven his son to the act. An inquest into his death this week heard Mr Waite had been threatened with bailiffs over an unpaid £600 council tax bill shortly before his death . John Waite, 58, urged young adults experiencing any sort of difficulty in their life to confide in others rather than 'bottle things up'. He said: 'He loved football, loved Naomi and his daughter and just loved life. I thought he would have come to me if there was anything wrong but he did bottle stuff up. 'The night in question we were all out together and he nipped into town and he was happy as Larry. He was having a good laugh and we never thought anything of it. 'He had a lot of pressure building up in work and with debts. I think it was on the spur of the moment and he has done it.' Ms Booth insisted their troubles were no more than that of the average young family. 'We had financial problems,' she said. 'We forgot to pay our council tax bills so we had the bailiffs coming round. He was worried that we never had any money to do anything. 'The only things that depressed him were money problems and stresses at work. We had our arguments but nothing out of the ordinary. He seemed upset on the day it happened but said it was because he had a tough weekend at work. 'I don't know why he did it. He is the type of person, who, if he thinks about something, he will do it straight away.' Mr Waite died just weeks after he was praised by a judge as a 'have-a-go hero' for risking his life to save a complete stranger who had been set upon by thugs. Mr Waite had come across a man being attacked in the street and flung himself on top of the victim as a gang rained down blows. When the attackers were jailed in April, Recorder Philip Parry recommended the High Sherriff of Lancashire give Mr Waite a £300 reward for his selfless actions. At the inquest this week, Blackpool assistant coroner Derek Baker reached a conclusion of suicide. He said: 'I have no evidence to suggest he expected to be interrupted. It suggests this is a settled decision. 'The timing of the last text doesn't seem to me this was a cry for help. It's a text which indicates intention to take his own life and he did make a settled decision to do that in circumstances where he would not anticipate being interrupted. Mr Waite's devastated family say they have no idea what forced him to the tragic act, but that he may have done something 'on the spur of the moment' He added: 'It does not mean he contemplated this for days or weeks because you would have noticed something. I don't know whether he had bottled something up but I don't think it was something he was seriously contemplating.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Waite's father said: 'We take comfort with Tulisa and making sure she has the best life possible but nothing will be the same. 'People just need to talk about their problems. Don't keep it to yourself. It's just too much hurt.' Ms Booth said she wouldn't let her daughter forget her father. 'We are going to talk about him all the time,' she said. 'He was a brilliant dad. I will remember how fun and loving he was. I couldn't imagine him doing anything like this.'

"By . Thomas Burrows . Raymond Betson, 52, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for attempted robbery at Maidstone Crown Court after a botched raid in Swanley, Kent . A notorious burglar who smashed into the wrong wall of a cash depot and ended up in an empty room has been jailed for 13 years. Raymond Betson, 52, tried to smash through the cash depot wall in an attempted multi-million pound raid with a stolen heavy-duty digger. But he rammed through the wrong part of the building and led his gang of up to six men into an empty office. Betson, who was the ringleader of a gang who tried to rob £350m of diamonds from the Millennium Dome in 2000, was found guilty of attempted robbery and jailed at Maidstone Crown Court. He claimed in court he was a reformed character, but the jury disagreed. He said: 'You have heard evidence as to my character once I got out of jail. Yes, I was involved in the Dome caper but I have reformed since then. My family is more important to me.' The raid took place at the Loomis cash depot in Swanley, Kent in the early hours of March 23, 2012. Betson and the gang used a stolen heavy-duty digger to smash down the wall, but broke down the wrong wall . Once the digger had broken through the wall, the gang, who were armed with baseball bats and white sacks, climbed over the rubble only to find an empty room. They then entered a nearby warehouse - only to find that was empty too - and fled less than a minute later. They then botched their getaway when they had to abandon their car in a field when it got stuck in the mud. After launching an investigation, Kent Police  found an abandoned Mitsubishi 4x4 in a field near a farm. Betson and the gang used a heavy-duty digger to smash down the wall - but broke down the wrong wall . The vehicle had become grounded on a dip but inside officers found a two-way radio, a baseball bat and large white bags. In a nearby bush, a balaclava, a snood and a running stopwatch were also found which allowed officers to calculate the time on the stopwatch and link it to the attempted robbery. Betson, of Clifton Crescent, Folkestone, was arrested on December 5 when police found his DNA on a discarded balaclava at the scene. The gang then botched their getaway when their Mitsubishi 4x4 got stuck in the mud in a field near a farm . On July 18, Betson was found guilty of attempted robbery at Maidstone Crown Court and today he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Betson tried to break into the Swanley cash depot only months after being released from jail for being the notorious ring leader of the Dome Raiders. He led a team of villains, who made headline news around the world, in an audacious smash-and-grab at the Dome, now known as the 02 arena. The gang, which included Raymond Betson, 52, smashed through the wrong wall in a bungled raid . The Dome Raiders smashed through the entrance to the Millennium Dome on a converted JCB digger dressed as terrorists with sledgehammers and smoke grenades and smashed open a glass cabinet. They boasted they would never be caught and prided themselves on their meticulous planning to keep one step ahead of the law, using state of the art technology and anti-surveillance devices. But just like the Dome itself, the raid ended in ignominious failure. Betson was jailed in 2002 for a maximum of 18 years in prison for his part in the raid. His sentence was later reduced to 15 years. Betson, 52, was part of the Dome Raiders that tried to steal £350m worth of diamonds in 2000 . The Dome Raiders, led by Betson, were caught as they made a getaway by speedboat on the River Thames . Detective Inspector Rob Haines, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'Betson wanted to make a lot of money quickly and was significantly involved in this botched robbery. 'The attempt displayed a level of violence, planning and organisation with the use of a digger, weapons such as baseball bats and a getaway vehicle. 'But what went from an armed robbery quickly turned into a farce because they knocked down the wrong wall, then searched an empty warehouse and managed to render the getaway vehicle useless as they fled the scene, discarding equipment nearby. 'I'm pleased the courts have recognised the seriousness of Betson's crime.' None of the other gang members have been caught but detectives say they will continue their search. In particular, Kent Police are seeking the whereabouts of 37-year old Karl Patrick Delaney.","Raymond Betson, 52, stole a heavy-duty digger but broke down wrong wall .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Updated: . 08:04 EST, 2 February 2012 . Two young men found dead in a pond near an Army barracks died from drowning, police have revealed. The bodies are believed to be those of missing 17-year-old Hugo Wenn and Daniel Lloyd, understood to have been in his 20s. The pair were discovered almost 10 hours apart in Reed Pond, near Howe Barracks in Canterbury, Kent, on Monday. Investigation: The bodies are believed to be 17-year-old Hugo Wenn (left), who has been missing since last Friday, and Daniel Lloyd (right) A 54-year-old man arrested on suspicion of their murders has now been released without charge, Kent Police said. A second man has since been arrested by detectives in connection with the inquiry. The 28-year-old, from Canterbury, Kent, . was held at 9.30pm yesterday on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs, . a spokesman for Kent Police said. He said: 'Police investigating the unexplained deaths of two men in a pond in Canterbury have confirmed that the post-mortem examinations carried out on the men during the past 24 hours reveal that they both died from drowning. 'Officers are awaiting further toxicology results. The families of both men have been notified of the outcome of the post-mortem examinations.' Hugo had been missing since Friday. He was a former pupil of the city's Archbishop's School. Daniel Lloyd, understood to have been in his 20s, is thought to be one of the two found dead in a pond . Busking: Tributes have been paid to guitarist Daniel Lloyd, who was seen regularly playing songs in Canterbury . Hugo, who was 6ft 3in tall and said to be a busker and close friend of the other dead man, lived in the pretty village of Barham with his parents Margaret and Robert. He has a brother, Felix, who is a student at Cardiff University and a former pupil at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in the city. His Facebook page was inundated with messages of support. On Sunday another brother, Oscar, had posted on Hugo's Facebook wall: 'Hugo, mum and dad want to know where you are. Xx.' Friends of Hugo mounted an online campaign to find him when he went missing, but the pages have now been closed. A Facebook tribute site called RIP Hugo Wenn has been set up and has been flooded with tributes. Emma-Jane Green wrote: 'RIP Hugo, you've touched so many people with your incredible beatboxing. Such a talent, all my wishes go to your family and hope you rest in peace. Sleep well dude! xx.' Meanwhile, Kim Wyatt said: 'Cant believe it just wont sink in that happy young lad wont be cycling around the village anymore saying hi with his big cheesy grin R.I.P Hugo deepest thoughts for your family xx.' Fondly remembered: Flowers are left at the entrance to the scene around Reed Pond . Another friend added: 'Dear Hugo, Can't believe this has happened. We all love and miss you buddy. Can't believe how many people loved you. 'We all knew how much you loved Beatbox as you busked with everyone in the band at some point, be it Tom playing the guitar or Jamie beatboxing, and sometimes even the whole band.' Hugo was a former pupil at the Archbishop's School in Canterbury, and left last year after completing his GCSE exams. Its headteacher Michael Liddicoat described Hugo as a 'gentle giant' who enjoyed more practical subjects including music, drama and sport. He said: 'We are a very small school and there is a sense of complete shock at this loss. Hugo enjoyed many different subjects, including music, sport and drama. Forensic examination: The investigation into the grisly discoveries is ongoing . 'In doing those subjects, he had many friends across the school. We will be holding a school assembly tomorrow to remember him and to say prayers. 'In many ways, Hugo was a gentle giant who was about 6ft 3in so you couldn't miss him around school. He was fantastic with the younger students and he will be missed.' Friends of Hugo said he was due to meet friends at the Blind Dog pub just two miles away from Reed Pond, but failed to show up on Friday evening.

Reed Pond is on Ministry of Defence land behind Howe Barracks but MoD officials ruled out any connection between the deaths and the armed forces. An Army spokesman said: 'It is extremely sad news that two bodies have been discovered on the training area behind Howe Barracks in Canterbury. 'This piece of land is owned by Defence Estates and, while occasionally used by the Army, is open to the public. 'It is not thought that the deaths were in any way connected with HM armed forces. 'A number of soldiers were involved in helping with the ground search prior to the discovery of the bodies but the matter is now entirely in the hands of the police. 'Our thoughts are with the friends and families of the deceased.' Anyone with information should call the incident room on 01303 289600.

A British glamour model has been given a 16 month suspended sentence by an Italian court after being caught red handed on a shopping spree using a dozen cloned credit cards. Chloe Phelan, 18, from south-west London, who has appeared topless in several lads mags and is also a lingerie model, was caught by police as she and her accomplice Issah Faisal Yusuf, 21, used the credit cards in an Apple store. Suspicious staff had called police after they tried to buy iPads, but the transaction did not go through and they then panicked and fled, as an alert was flashed to other shops in the retail outlet where they were. The pair, both from London, had arrived in Rome on a Ryanair flight and were booked to leave the same day they arrived after carrying out the spree which involved twelve cloned American Express cards. When officers stopped them they found shopping bags containing more than 3,000 euros (£2,390) worth of items including clothes, electrical goods and perfume. Both appeared before a judge in a fast track hearing at Rome's main court and agreed a plea bargain deal which saw them given a reduced sentence and they were immediately left Italy and headed for Britain. A police spokesman in Rome said: 'We were called by staff at the Apple Store and when we got to the centre we quickly located the couple. 'The girl burst into tears when we stopped her and told her what she was being arrested for. 'She claimed the cards were hers and had been given to her by her agent but they were all cloned American Express credit cards that belonged to several other Italian people. Phelan is currently signed to a Surrey based model agency called Charles and Ko . 'At the court hearing she told the judge she was a model and that she had no idea the cards were cloned. She insisted they had been given to her by her manager. 'They had arrived in Rome on the first flight from London and were due out the same day on the last flight - the intention was to spend as much as possible using the cloned credit cards.' Phelan is currently signed to a Surrey based model agency called Charles and Ko. Sources said she was also due to appear on a BBC3 show later this year called South Side Stories.

Alexandra Clark said the name, which means 'Jew with large breasts', was not offensive and the university failed to consult her before claiming it was. 'You turned a lighthearted joke and rookie name given to me by my row mates with my full consent into something shameful,' Clark wrote in a letter to university president, Michael Drake. 'In my three years with the band, far from encountering a sexualized and hostile environment, I made some of the best friends I'll ever have.' Scroll down for video . Loyal: Former Ohio State University marching band member Alexandra Clark (center) has written to the university's president seeking the reinstatement of the band director Jonathan Waters . The letter is published in full on the The Buckeye Battle Cry website. Clark, a member of the band's C-Row from 2009 to 2011, also claimed investigators 'showed . a 'complete lack of respect for the privacy and dignity of the band . members'. 'The . Ohio State University has decided, without ever informing me, to make . this public to the entire world, even though they couldn't even spell it . correctly,' Clark, who uses the Twitter handle @Joobilicious, wrote in her scathing letter. Clark also defended her band director, Waters, saying he always fostered mature dialogue in the band community and made it clear that bad behavior would result in expulsion.

Clark goes by the handle @Joobilicious on Twitter . 'I have been out of the band for three years but my closest and best friends refer to me almost exclusively as Joobs. They are not saying it to offend or sexualize me,' Clark wrote. 'They are saying it because they love me and care about me and it's a connection to an experience we all shared and a bond we'll have for the rest of our lives.' Ohio . State University sacked band director Waters last week after determining he ignored a 'sexualized' culture of rituals . including students being pressured to march in their underwear and . participate in sexually themed stunts. Waters had led the band since 2012, and served in lesser capacities for a decade before that. His . halftime shows for what's known to fans as 'The Best Damn Band in the . Land' were considered revolutionary and drew millions of viewers on . YouTube. Ohio State . President Michael Drake, on the job just three weeks, said that he was . 'profoundly disappointed and shocked' by the findings of a two-month . investigation that began before his arrival. Ohio State University marching band director Jon Waters (pictured last November). OSU on Thursday fired Waters amid allegations he knew about and ignored 'serious cultural issues' including sexual harassment . 'This is 2014, and we respect our students as young adults,' Drake said. 'We respect women, and we respect all the different people who work with us, we respect that diversity. We just had to make a square-wave change between this report, which was unacceptable, and the future, which we start today.' The probe determined Waters knew about and failed to stop what the university called 'serious cultural issues' within the band. Email and phone messages were left for Waters and the band alumni association seeking comment. In the report, Waters denies the allegations against him — including that he texted sexual limericks to band members — and disagrees that the band's culture is sexualized. He said the culture was evolving, while suggesting to investigators 'that sexual innuendo is found in much of what college students do.' A spokesman said the university was required to promptly perform the probe under federal Title IX sexual discrimination laws, after a parent complained band members were asked to swear secrecy oaths 'about objectionable traditions and customs,' some in place well before Waters took over. Those included raunchy songs and a late-night march, described as optional, in which band members stripped down to their underwear. Investigators found band staff and directors, including Waters, had sometimes attended. One female student said older members of the band would warn newcomers to wear 'fuller coverage' undergarments for the event; others wore pajamas or shorts, but some marched naked. In the report, assistant Director . Michael Smith said he didn't believe it when he saw it. An associate . band director, Christopher Hech, said he recalled a student having . alcohol poisoning at the event some years ago. The . report also described students earning sexually themed nicknames based . on tasks other band members assigned them: One female student had to . pretend to have an orgasm while sitting on the lap of her brother, a . fellow band member and was given the nickname 'squirt', according to DeadSpin. 'The greatest job in the world': Waters began with the band during college and rose through the ranks before being named director in 2012 . The site also claims that two female . band members rubbed their breasts together and were nicknamed 'Jewoobs' and 'Tiggles'. Others pretended to be sex toys, prostitutes or . body parts. Waters was aware of some students' nicknames and allegedly . used them 'when he was upset,' witnesses said, but he's also reported to . have advised students against the monikers. Drake, . the university's first black president, said he wants to see the band . get beyond such activities and carry on its tradition of excellence. 'There are an infinite number of ways that people can bond that are not really demeaning and anachronistic,' he said. The . university has appointed former Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery . to lead an independent task force assigned to review the matter, which . will include representatives from Ernst & Young, the Sports Conflict . Institute and outside counsel to provide guidance on Title IX . compliance. Waters started . in the band as an undergraduate, playing sousaphone all four years . during college. He graduated in 2000 and became a graduate assistant . with the band, its assistant director and then interim director under . Jon Woods, who retired after 25 years. Waters told an OSU Alumni Club . gathering in Chillicothe in March his was 'the greatest job in America.' His firing was first reported by The Columbus Dispatch. During . his tenure, Waters revolutionized the band's halftime shows through the . use of iPads instead of paper, allowing students to morph into the . shapes of horses, superheroes and dinosaurs galloping, flying and . tromping across the field. Its technological advances landed the band in . an Apple commercial in January. One performance in which the band takes . the shape of a moonwalking Michael Jackson has more than 10 million . views on YouTube.

"By . Chris Parsons . Updated: . 09:55 EST, 1 February 2012 . Pay out: A court ruled Tomas James was not lawfully arrested when police bundled him into a van in 2008 . An insurance worker who rang 999 from the back of a police van after officers 'roughed him up' has won £10,000 in damages. Innocent Tomas James was wrongly arrested and bundled into a police van after taking his girlfriend to hospital in Cardiff. Mr James, 28, dialled 999 to speak to emergency services as he was left handcuffed and locked in the police van. He claimed he was hit with a baton and punched in the head, and had called emergency services for protection from the officers who arrested him. Mr James, who was prosecuted for an offence of assaulting a police officer and obstruction, has since been awarded a pay out after a court hearing. A court acquitted him on all counts and ruled he had not been lawfully arrested. A transcript of his 999 call was given to the court - as he asked the emergency service operator for protection from the officers. It read: 'I was arrested but they haven’t told me what for. The police were very heavy handed with me and my friend, we have been roughed up. 'We are parked up somewhere and have been left in the back of the van.' Mr James launched a civil action after accusing officers of jamming his foot in the door, striking him with a baton and punching him in the head. He yesterday won more than £10,000 damages from South Wales Police in an out-of-court settlement over his wrongful arrest. Held: CCTV images show the moment another man was led away by police at University Hospital of Wales, the incident in which Mr James intervened, angering officers . Tomas James had taken his girlfriend to the accident and emergency department at the University Hospital of Wales when he was wrongly arrested . The 999 operator’s report stated: 'Call received from Tomas James states he has been assaulted and thrown into a police van. 'The informant was very calm throughout call and stated himself and his friend were thirsty and concerned at how tight the cuffs were on his friend'. Mr James had taken his girlfriend to the accident and emergency department at the University Hospital of Wales with a broken foot during a night out in January 2008. At the hospital, Mr James saw another man in police custody who had been arrested in a separate incident. Mr James said he asking the arrested man if he was 'alright' - but said three police officers objected to his questions. He was then taken into custody himself and bundled into a van, saying he was assaulted during the arrest. Mr James sued South Wales Police and the case was due to be decided by a jury at the Cardiff Civil Justice Centre. But the police settled out of court at the start of the trial when the force agreed to pay Mr James a 'five-figure sum'. They will also pay his legal costs. Roughed up: Mr James rang 999 to complain about the officers who had arrested him. Pictured here are police arresting another man at the hospital . His solicitor Leslie Thomas said: 'We have came to settlement that both parties agree with and this have saved some great deal of public expense.' Gareth Madge, Director of Legal Services with South Wales Police, said: 'I can confirm the parties have been able to reach a settlement of this civil claim without any admission of liability. 'As a publicly-funded organisation, South Wales Police is always mindful of the cost to public funds and on occasions a settlement on this basis, in accordance with Counsel’s advice, is the most appropriate course of action.'","Tomas James rang 999 to ask for protection from officers who had arrested him .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A businessman fed up with his partner sneaked out the office to play golf has showed him just how teed-off he was - by moving his entire office to the tenth hole on his favourite course. Tony Coleshill, 50, set up a printing firm with Chris Antoniou in 2001 and built it up to make a £3 million annual turnover. But a few years ago Mr Antoniou, 50, took up golf - and became hooked. Teed off: Tony Coleshill was livid after realising his business partner Chris Antoniou was skiving to play golf . Confrontation: He moved Mr Antoniou's entire office to Heaton Moor Golf Club in Stockport, Manchester . Soon, his partner noticed he was failing to pull his weight as director. Mr Coleshill said members of staff repeatedly spotted him on the golf course or the driving range during office hours where Chris allegedly told them to keep quiet. Furious, he recruited four friends who took photos of his pal in action and went out 'undercover' himself in borrowed cars and caught him on the course. He finally broke after a tough week at work and decided to put him off his stroke at last. He hired a team of five removal men who tailed Chris heading to Heaton Moor Golf Course in Stockport, Grtr Manchester on yet another working day. As he played the opening holes they set up his entire office - desk, cabinets, computer and even his coffee mug - by the side of the tenth tee. When he rounded the corner with his clubs, Mr Coleshill handed an astonished Mr Antoniou a letter informing him he was looking at ways of ending the working relationship. Mr Coleshill, from Stockport, said: 'He has not been pulling his weight for years and I think he must have thought I was pretty stupid. Office: This was Mr Antoniou's set up at the pair's printing company in Greater Manchester, set up in 2001 . Revenge: With the help of some friends, Mr Coleshill decided to completely dismantle his desk and cabinets . Making a point: He had noticed Mr Antoniou was nipping out the office every day to pot some holes . Every last bit: Even Mr Antoniou's mug was packed up and relocated to the course, while he was playing . 'It was bugging me big time and I knew I had to do something. 'He's been leaving the office to pay golf three times a week when he was supposed to be at work. 'He'd disappear all the time so I thought, well, I'll just take his work to him.' Mr Coleshill said he was putting in around 50 hours a week with his B2B1 Print Solutions company to make up for the work load. He added: 'One particular day he came in at 9.10am and then he was off at 9.30am and I didn't see him for the rest of the day. 'I was driving home one day and it was really bugging me big time. 'I then saw this kid knocking a golf ball along and I thought 'I hate the sight of golf' and I realised what I could do.' 'Worth it': Mr Coleshill said he was putting in around 50 hours of work a week to make up for the backlog . Effort: The group hired a van to load the lot across to the golf course in one go . The ordeal left Mr Antoniou feeling distinctly under par when he pulled off his office move last month. He said: 'We took the lot - desk, chair, his little filing cabinet, the printer, keyboard, screen and even his coffee mug which fittingly said 'Keep Calm And Play Golf'. 'Chris came around the corner and his face, it was absolute astonishment. 'It was totally unexpected. I said ""Chris, I thought you were at work?"" and he didn't say anything. 'I said ""I've brought your work to you"". Letter: A shocked Mr Antoniou was handed a letter with details of plans to end their business partnership . 'I said ""I've got a letter for you here, you better read it very carefully"". I walked away and left him with the problem of what to do with the desk.' Mr Coleshill said the letter formally informed Mr Antoniou he was looking at ways of ending the working relationship and discussions are ongoing over the future of the company. When asked for comment Mr Antoniou said: 'I don't want to publicise it to be honest. 'I've got no comment. I don't wish to comment at all.'","Tony Coleshill, 50, and Chris Antoniou, 50, set up printing business in 2001 .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Older than Stonehenge, taller than the White Cliffs of Dover and wider than 50 football pitches: this is the magical Iron Age hill fort that has been bought by the National Trust to preserve for the nation. At more than 2,000 years old, Hambledon Hill in Dorset has a rich natural and archaeological story dating back to before the construction of Stonehenge. It is home to half the UK's butterfly population, having escaped the advances of agriculture. And from the summit of the fort it is possible to see three counties - Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire. 'Magical': This is Hambledon hill fort in Dorset, the 'magical' landscape that the National Trust has bought in a bid to preserve the 6,000-year-old pastures . The Iron Age fort is the first the trust has acquired for 30 years and overlies one of the most significant early neolithic landscapes in western Europe dating back almost 6,000 years, the trust said. Causeway enclosures seen on the hill date back 5,500 years, and together with nearby National Trust-owned Hod Hill the site tells the story of the beginnings of farming, the need for defence and the arrival of the Romans in Britain, the trust said. The fort is also a national nature reserve, with 28 species of butterfly including the Adonis blue, dark green fritillary and green hairstreak recorded on the nationally important chalk grassland site. And it is home to at least five species of orchids, including the autumn lady's tresses, as well as glow worms, brown hares, kestrels and meadow pipits. Historical: It is the size of 50 football pitches, twice the height of the White Cliffs of Dover, older than Stonehenge, and home to half the UK's butterfly population . Preserved: The pastures in Dorset have managed to maintain the population of wildlife as farmers have avoided the area as agriculture has advanced over the years . Simon Ford, National Trust wildlife adviser, said: 'The beauty of a magical place like Hambledon Hill is the combination of a rich natural and archaeological story that goes back thousands of years. 'Wandering around a site whose human history pre-dates Stonehenge and takes you back to the early days of farming makes the heart skip a beat. 'The sound of a skylark ascending above the rich grassland and sight of a cloud of Adonis blue butterflies in flight touches the soul. This is a place where you feel totally connected to the world around you.' Jerry Broadway, a National Trust volunteer working on Hambledon Hill, said: 'When I come here I feel like someone would when they go into St Paul's Cathedral. Younger: The first stones at Stonehenge, near Salisbury, were thought to be raised in 2200 BC, making it far younger than the Iron Age hill fort bought by the Trust . Scale: The hill is twice the height of the White Cliffs of Dover, which stand at 350 feet, and from the summit, three counties are visible: Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire . 'When there is no one else around and I sit on the top of the hill looking at the view I feel very privileged. And to play a small part in looking after the hill is a good feeling.' Hambledon Hill has been owned for the last three decades by the Hawthorn Trust and managed by Government conservation agency Natural England as a national nature reserve. The purchase is being funded by a land purchase grant from Natural England and with money from a legacy left to the trust for the countryside in Dorset, and brings to seven the number of hill forts owned by the trust in the county.","Hambledon Hill, Dorset, is around 6,000 years old and stands at twice the height of the White Cliffs of Dover .

"By . James  Nye . and Associated  Press Reporter . A pleasant Sunday afternoon walk along a crowded Florida beach turned into a nightmare for one family when a light aircraft made an emergency landing and killed a father and critically injured his daughter. Sgt. Ommy Irizarry, 36, who was vacationing in the Sunshine State from neighboring Georgia with his wife and three children, was struck when a 1972 Piper Cherokee aircraft touched down on Caspersen Beach and died at the scene. His nine-year-old daughter, Oceana, was critically injured and was been taken by helicopter to All Children's Hospital for emergency treatment. Another woman who witnessed the incident suffered a heart attack and is currently being treated at Venice Regional Hospital. It is unclear how quickly the plane came down and why Irizarry and his daughter were not able to get out of the way of the crashing aircraft in time. Scroll Down for Video . Family man: Ommy Irizarry, 36, with his three children. The father-of-three was killed in a tragic accident on Sunday when a light aircraft crash landed on Caspersen Beach in Florida. His nine-year-old daughter, Oceana (second right) was critically injured in the incident also . One day before: In these pictures, Ommy Irizarry is seen smiling and enjoying his vacation in Florida on Saturday - one day before he was killed in a freak accident caused by a light aircraft crash landing on a Venice, Florida, beach . Fatal crash: The 1972 Piper Cherokee made an emergency landing on Caspersen Beach in Venice . The plane's pilot, Karl Kokomoor, 57, of Englewood, Florida and his passenger David Theen, 60, were not injured. New photos and video footage from the beach showed the Piper Cherokee, its nose pointed down and nearly touching white sands only feet from what appeared to be a gentle lapping surf. The left wing appeared to extend slightly over the water's edge. A police boat was anchored nearby and a law enforcement officer stood beside the aircraft. Bystanders gawked from a distance. Sarasota Sheriff's spokesperson, Wendy Rose, said that the plane issued a distress signal at 2.45pm and informed Venice Airport the craft could not make it back to the airport. The pilot told the tower he was going to try to land on the beach. According to local reports the plane careened into the sea and the NTSB is heading to the scene to begin an investigation. 'One man is deceased, and a young girl, possibly around the age of 10 is very critically injured,' Sarasota County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Wendy Rose told ABC News. The pilot and the passenger in the plane were not injured when the aircraft landed. 'The pilot radioed that he was not going to be able to make it back to the airport, and he was going to try to land on the hard-packed sand of the beach,' Rose told ABC News. A father was killed and his daughter seriously injured while walking . along a Florida beach when a small plane crash landed Sunday on the Gulf . Coast only feet from the surf, authorities said. Resting: The pilot of the 1972 Piper Cherokee and his passenger were uninjured in the crash landing . Runway: The pilot indicated to air traffic controllers that he was going to use the hard sand bank on Caspersen Beach as a runway to land . 'He landed about the water's edge and the pilot and his male passenger were both unharmed.' Rose said that there may not have been enough time for the father and daughter to get out the way. 'I do know the timing of his radio to the Venice Airport and immediate response was minutes so there was not, from what I understand, there was not a lot of time between his radio dispatch and the crash,' she said to ABC News. However, Venice Beach Mayor John Holic, himself a former air traffic controller, told ABC News that he believes the plane lost power mid-flight. 'One of the first things that you learn when you're flying is to always be aware of your surroundings and where you may be able to touch down in the event of loss of power. A beach is a viable place,' he told ABC News. Investigation: Officials from the NTSB are arriving soon to the beach to try to understand how the aircraft came down so suddenly . Photos and video footage taken at the scene showed the Piper Cherokee, its nose pointed down and nearly touching white sans only feet from a gentle lapping surf. The left wing appeared to extend over the water's edge. A police boat was anchored nearby and a law enforcement officer stood close by. Bystanders gawked from a distance. Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, told The Associated Press in an email that the FAA was investigating. She said the plane reportedly lost power and landed on the sand near Caspersen Beach in Venice but she had no further details as of Sunday evening. National Transportation and Safety Board investigators have headed to the site. 'We don't know exactly what caused the crash but the NTSB is en route and will investigate,' added Rose, a community affairs manager for the sheriff's office.","Ommy Irizarry, 36, and his nine-year-old daughter, Oceana, struck after stricken plane crashes on Caspersen Beach in Florida .

"By . Mia De Graaf . This is the horrifying moment a teenage boy fling himself off a cliff into a sea of jagged rocks - before limping onto the shore. Geared on by a crowd of friends, he only had room for a few steps' run up before attempting to leap over the perilous stones. It is the latest case of so-called tombstoning, which has caused 20 deaths and 76 severe injuries in Britain in less than a decade. Scroll down for video . Perilous: The teenager squints as he aims his feet to land inches away from the jagged rocks of the sea in Porthleven, Cornwall, after jumping from a cliff . Painful: He winces in apparent pain, crashing into the shallow water. It is the latest case of 'tombstoning' - where youngsters jump upright from cliffs into the sea . The dangerous sport - dubbed 'tombstoning' because jumpers try to stay upright as they hit the water - sees youngsters throw themselves into shallow waters from dozens of feet in the air. Propelling himself off the top of a cliff in Cornwall known as the 'pill box', this boy clamped his eyes shut. He moved his arms and legs wildly in a desperate bid to make it over the 15ft stretch of stone between the cliff base and the sea. Incredibly, his feet appeared to hit the water inches away from the jagged rocks. But he emerged from the water wincing and limping to the shore - as his friends prepared to take their own leap. Last week, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) issued a fresh plea to teenagers to stop the activity after footage emerged of 'the most dangerous yet'. Life-threatening: The boy wildly moved his arms and legs to push himself forwards. The activity has claimed the lives of 20 Britons in less than a decade, figures reveal . Leap: The group of boys geared each other on as they prepared to leap over 15 feet of stone to reach the rock-ridden waters below the cliff, called the 'pill box' The video captured a group of teenagers jumping from 35ft into water filled with jagged rocks in Old Portsmouth, Hampshire. Although the beach at the Hot Walls is not patrolled by lifeguards, it has become a notorious hotspot for tombstoning. Rogan Wheeldon, RNLI lifeguard supervisor, said: 'Tombstoning anywhere is incredibly dangerous but this footage is some of the most dangerous I've ever seen. 'These people are jumping from about 35ft into shallow water which hides jagged rocks on the seabed. They are risking their lives, there is no doubt about it.' Warning: This latest incident comes just days after the RNLI issued a warning to teenagers to avoid the activity during summer as there aren't enough lifeguards . He added: 'Our advice is simple. Please don't tombstone. You will be risking broken limbs, paralysis or death for a quick thrill. It's not worth it. 'In this spot in Portsmouth there are also very strong water currents of six to eight knots which can sweep you out to sea. The best way to enjoy the seaside safely is to swim between the red and yellow flags at a lifeguarded beach.' In 2008, a man was paralysed and confined to a wheelchair when he jumped into the water from Southsea Pier in a tombstoning incident. The safety appeal comes as the RNLI launches a major drowning awareness campaign called Respect the Water.","Boy clamps eyes shut and waves arms and legs wildly to jump over 15ft-stretch of stone between cliff and sea .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Towering over the waters at 177ft, HMY Britannia once ruled the waves. Built for playboy Prince Albert in 1893, she became a star of the international sailing scene, winning 33 of 43 prestigious races in her first year alone. Her winning streak continued once Albert - then King Edward VII - handed the elegant racer to his son, George V. Rule Britannia: The elegant wooden yacht HMY  Britannia, built in 1893 for playboy Prince Albert, became a sailing champion within her first year of racing . Rising up: After decades of legal battles, a construction team have almost completed an inch-by-inch replica of HMY Britannia, currently lying in Hythe, Southampton . In fact, she was so loved by George that he left instructions that she would 'follow him to the grave' - and when he died in 1936, she was stripped of her furnishings and sunk off the Isle of Wight. Now, 78 years on, campaigners are nearing the final stages of a project to complete an an inch-perfect replica of Britannia which has been 20 years in the making. The original Britannia remains on the sea bed somewhere off the coast of St Catherine's Deep - though her official location is a secret. But a construction team, which has fought through a bitter legal battle to secure their rights, hopes the replica will be able to take its place alongside iconic warships HMS Victory and HMS Warror at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. The elaborate hull is now 'finished' - aside from a £6 million refurbishment needed to restore her guilded appearance. Although she is currently lying at a boatyard in Hythe, near Southampton, Hampshire, project leaders say it could be on the water within 15 months. At the cost of £1 million a year to run, she will then be taken all round the world so it can be enjoyed by charities and future generations. Royal favourite: Queen Victoria's notorious party-boy son Prince Albert (left) and his son George (right) adored Britannia, spending most of their year on board . Beloved: King George V (centre) loved the 177ft yacht so much that he ordered for her to 'follow him to the grave' when he died in 1936. She was sunk off the Isle of Wight . Star: The yacht, pictured dwarfing the Bernera, won 33 of her first 43 prestigious races, becoming one of the most successful racers in the world of sailing . Design: The interior was cutting-edge Art Déco, with state-of-the-art architecture to host parties and guests for the royals . The project  started in 1994 when Norwegian entrepreneur Sigurd Coates gained the Queen's blessing to build a replica of her great-grandfather's yacht. Mr Coates bought a shipyard in Archangel, Russia, and assembled a team of top boat builders and designers to build the boat using the original plans. The hull of the yacht was finished but the project ran into trouble in the late 1990s when he sold the shipyard to free up funds and the new owners laid claim to Britannia. A lengthy court battle ensued and by the time Mr Coates got the boat back to Norway his funds - along with his love for the project - had dried up. In 2011 a British company called K1 Britannia came to the rescue and invested enough to keep the project alive and the yacht was transported to Cowes on the Isle of Wight before being moved to a temporary base at Hythe. A look inside: Workers have managed to reconstruct the interior - and have appealed for collectors to source the furnishings that were saved before she was sunk . Large scale: The hull is supposedly 'finished' but will still require a £6 million refurbishment before it can sail the seas - at the cost of £1 million a year . It is hoped the yacht will go on to join iconic warships HMS Victory and HMS Warrior at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard where the final refit will be carried out. The £8 million needed to complete the build will pay for the vast interior of the yacht to be fitted out in period decor to the highest quality. It will also fund the building of a lead keel, sails made from traditional cloth, and a huge 153ft, three-tonne silver spruce mast which will be the biggest single wooden mast in the world. The trust is also appealing for fixtures and fittings that adorned the original yacht which were saved before it was sunk to be donated. They are in the process of shipping an original corner cupboard from Britannia from France while Ken Beken, a marine photographer, has the original medicine chest. First crew: This is the first crew in 1893 who brought the King international glory. It is hoped she will be able to sail with similar success in the years to come . Dream: The dream is for the new Britannia to be based in Cowes, Isle of Wight, near to the secret location where the remains of the original lie . Jo Macaulay, from K1 Britannia, said: 'The dream is for Britannia to be a working yacht that upholds the prestige and values of the King's original. 'We have had to strip her down to her bare hull and start again. 'We've been in talks with the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and the hope is that we can move Britannia there once funds are in place. It would be a perfect home for her rebuild among the most important vessels in Britain's heritage. 'Once finished her long-term home will be in Cowes. 'We need to raise about eight million pounds. The boat itself will cost around six million pounds but then it will cost around 1.5 million pounds a year to run. 'It's a mammoth task but one that we are passionate about succeeding in. The whole point of the project is to create something historic that can be used and enjoyed by charities all over the world. 'Britannia is one of the best known and most loved yachts ever to have been built and through this replica her legacy will continue.' Britannia, a J-class yacht, gave its name to Queen Elizabeth II's famous motor yacht Britannia, however the two differ greatly. The Queen's yacht Britannia is 412ft long and is powered by a 12,000hp steam turbine. It was built in 1953 and in service from 1954 to 1997. It was turned into a floating museum is now berthed in Edinburgh.","HMY Britannia was built in 1893 for famed party boy Prince Albert, became international sailing star .

"By . Mia De Graaf . The father of a serial rapist says his own son should be locked up and they should 'throw away the key' after he was convicted of yet another offence. Jimmy Hunt has disowned his son, Lynx Caan, who served nine years in jail for five rapes against two women and threatening to kill his girlfriend. Caan, born Jonathan Hunt, made his latest appearance at Hull Crown Court for breaching his notification requirements under the sex offenders register. Disgusted: Jimmy Hunt and his wife Doreen (left) say rapist son Lynx Caan (right) should be jailed for life . The 43-year-old was handed a nine-month suspended sentence, after police discovered he was using another alias - one of eight - on Facebook, 'Jon Karma Rea'. Blasting the ruling, his father Mr Hunt, 65, and his wife, Doreen, 63, want everyone to know how much they suffer each time their son reoffends. Mr Hunt said: 'If I was a judge, I’d lock him up and throw away the key. 'He’s spent 14 years of his life in jail but it doesn’t deter him. 'He thinks he’s got a right to come into people’s lives and threaten them - we are not having it. 'I don’t want him in our lives any more. 'He’s been banned from our home for eight years - I don’t love him anymore.' Struggle: The couple claim they are harassed by passers-by as Caan is convicted of breaching the restrictions of the sex offenders register. He has already served nine years for five rapes of two women . He says the pair can no longer go out and about without being blamed for the crimes Lynx commits. The couple have even discussed moving to avoid the harassment they get daily. The 65-year-old said: 'We daren’t walk into our local. 'People always say ""your lads been in the paper"" - it always comes back to Doreen and I. 'I didn’t bring him up to be like this - we don’t and never have condoned what he’s done.' Caan's barrister, Nigel Clive, said he had created the bogus profile to avoid a woman in York, who had been warned by police about her conduct towards him. Caan declined to comment on suggestions he had brought shame on the family.","Lynx Caan, 43, served nine years for 5 rapes and threatening to kill partner .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Walked free: Karen Ackland, 44, had sex with her friend's 14-year-old son at a family party - but has been handed a suspended sentence . A mother whose friend had sex with her 14-year-old son at a family party has slammed a judge for letting her walk free from court. The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was sickened to discover Karen Ackland, 44, had taken advantage of her son - who is 30 years her junior. Divorced mother-of-two Ackland was at a party when she met the schoolboy. After hours of drinking the boy's mother offered Ackland a bed at their home. Ackland, the mother of two teenagers, pounced on the boy as he got ready for bed and used him as her 'sex object' - until the boy's older brother heard noises and caught her in the act. She was handed a nine-month jail term, suspended for a year, after admitting three charges of sexual activity with a child. Unleashing a scathing attack on the sentence, the child's mother said: 'If she had been a man I think she would have had a jail sentence. 'When my son was interviewed I was welling up. He looked exhausted, he was emotionally drained. 'It was absolutely harrowing to hear. 'Women should have as long sentences as men. It's exactly the same sexual act.' The peroxide-blonde was also heard to say 'I can't believe I'm doing this with a 15 year old!' Canterbury Crown Court heard the boy, who is now 16, was just 14 years old at the time. Ackland, of Kent, quickly changed her plea to guilty just before the victim was due to give evidence. Judge Simon James said Ackland had 'immediately regretted' her behaviour and although committed in drink he said 'that does not afford you any real excuses'. He added that the law was to protect teenagers from doing things which they may later regret. The youngster's distraught mother yesterday called for harsher sentences for female sex offenders. She said: 'I never expected her to do this, you trust your friends. And he was just a child. 'She was always a party animal and when she had too many drinks she completely loses all self-respect and embarrasses herself. 'She used to always say 'I'm a nightmare when I've had a drink' and she'd always have a few men on the go. 'But I was a great friend to her and I stood by her. I never expected this. 'She was very domineering and my son said as soon as it happened that he'd wished he'd never done it.' Enraged: The mother of the boy slammed the judge at Canterbury Crown Court calling for a tougher sentence . Ackland first set eyes on her young victim at the event on April 27 last year. The group first went back to Ackland's house where Andrew Espley, prosecuting, said 'everyone did three shots of Vodka'. Ackland then backed the helpless boy into a corner in the kitchen and they kissed. She tried to get the boy to walk her home on the pretext she had lost her phone, but his older brother refused to let him go. But as the boy went upstairs to get some tracksuit bottoms so he could changed for bed, Ackland sneaked into the room behind him. Mr Espley said: 'During this she was moaning and at one point asked him to spit into her mouth. 'What she did caused them to be discovered. 'Pounced': The court heard Ackland, mother of two teenagers, cornered the boy and used him for sex . 'She was drunk at the time and used the teenager as a sexual object.' After the boy's brother burst into the room, Ackland ran out the family's home and kept what she had done from the his mother. The boy later told a friend: 'I went to get into my trackies and she stripped naked in front of me. 'Yeah we had sex but it was really weird.' Mr Espley said within days the incident was the talk of the school and teachers were forced to report the incident to police. Ackland told a friend: 'He tried to kiss me. I'm a 40-year-old woman what am I supposed to do?' Domini Webber, defending, said the Tesco shelf-stacker grew up in Germany as the daughter of a father who was in the military. She married in 1993 but is now divorced with two teenage children. Mr Webber said: 'She accepts that this was extremely irresponsible behaviour and she admits to being a binge drinker.' Ackland was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register and pay £500 court costs. Director of children's charity Kidscape Claude Knights yesterday said the sentence 'sends out a very weak message'. She said: 'The suspended nine-month custodial sentence does not reflect the severity of this crime and sends out a very weak message. 'Despite many advances in our understanding the true extent of female sexual abuse remains a hidden picture. One has to ask how this crime would have been perceived had it been committed by a man. 'The response to such despicable crimes against children should be very robust regardless of the gender of the perpetrator.'","Karen Ackland, 44, met her friend's son at a party, cornered and kissed him .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A Chinese couple whose sons drowned in a quarry pit are keeping the boys' bodies in a deep freeze until officials explain why they hadn't filled it in. The site was excavated to make way for a new road two years ago. But it was left derelict and now, partially filled with water, it has become a magnet for local children. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Deep freeze: The bodies of Chung, three, and five-year-old Hu, who drowned in a quarry, are being kept in a fridge until their parents receive compensation from the council, which failed to fill in the site in Loudi, China . Playing: The boys had been throwing stones in the water when Chung (right) fell and Hu (left) tried to save him . Despite their parents' warnings, three-year-old Chung and his brother Hu, five, went to throw stones at the site in the Chinese city of Loudi, Hunan province, with two older friends last week, and fell in. Chung slipped off the side and Hu tried to save him but neither could swim. Terrified of getting in trouble, the other children ran home. The boys were found dead several hours later. Excavated: The quarry was dug out two years ago for a new road but was left derelict and is now water-filled . Distraught: Their mother Wang Libiao, 27, (left and right) and father Cai, 28 (right) are 'inconsolable' It came just days after another young boy almost drowned in the quarry but was saved by a passing villager. The boys' father Cai Libiao, 28, and mother Wang, 27, are now appealing for compensation from the council, and an explanation. Neighbour Shen Pai, 43, said: 'They worshipped their two boys, everything they did was for their children and they just want answers. Answers: The couple have been sleeping at the site as they research what led to their sons' premature death . Investigation: The couple vow to keep their sons' bodies until a proper investigation (pictured) is completed . 'The council knew this place was dangerous and hadn't acted on the complaints even when a lad almost died a week earlier.' So far though the council has declined to say anything and nor have the construction firm that apparently had promised to fill in the quarry. The parents meanwhile have put their two boys bodies in a fridge filled with ice while they await further news from the site's officials.","Chung, 3, and Hu, 5, fell in water-filled quarry when throwing stones .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A  greengrocers has re-opened for business almost 100 years after it served its first customers as an exact replica of how it used to be - complete with war-era produce. Gertrude Adey transformed her modest front room into a fruit and veg shop in 1916 to earn a few shillings so she could survive while husband William was fighting in the First World War. The business thrived and the pair served their local community until they retired in the 1930s. Revived: Ancestors of Gertrude and William Adey have rebuilt their once-thriving greengrocers 98 years later . War-era: Gertrude (centre right) transformed their home in Dudley, West Midlands, into a vegetable shop when William (centre left) went to war in 1916. They are pictured with their children Dolly and William Alexander . Now, after the historic building was demolished to make way for a new development, it has been lovingly rebuilt, brick-by-brick, down the road in Dudley, West Midlands. The time-warp shop only sells produce that was available at the time -  turnips, carrots, beans and potatoes; apples, pears and strawberries - from wooden crates and wicker baskets. Just like the original, the shop has no electricity supply - it is lit by gas lights and has no fridges. Rather than precise digital scales, traditional scales are used. Any left over goods are turned into pickles, chutneys and jams, just as it would have been back in the early 20th century. And staff are dressed in plain period clothing just as William and Gertrude would have worn. The opening of the shop is the culmination of a project by local historians who have rebuilt it in the grounds of an open-air museum in Dudley. Three generations of the Adey family - William’s grandson Jim, 85, great-grandson Andrew, 54, and great-great-granddaughter Melanie, 22 - officially opened the shop last Saturday. Cherished: The shop, pictured in 1950, thrived and served the local community until Mr and Mrs Adey retired in the 1930s but was then abandoned and later demolished to make way for a new development . Re-built: It has been re-built, brick-by-brick, down the road and still only sells seasonal, war-era produce . Mr Adey, 54, a dentist, said: 'There was a recent article in a local newspaper appealing for information about the Adey family and their connections to a greengrocers’ shop which once stood in Lower Lichfield Street in the town centre of Willenhall. 'I contacted the Black Country Living Museum and told them I was the great-grandson of William Adey and offered to help. I have been charting the family tree over the decades so I got all the information I could together and went to meet the curators. 'To my complete surprise I found out they had actually built an exact replica of the original shop at the museum. They showed me around it and it was like stepping back in time 100 years. 'It was very exciting finding out about it. It is a real legacy for our family. It is fascinating to see staff there selling produce just as my great grandfather and great grandmother would have done. Tribute: William (left with his son) and Gertrude were icons of the community. Now their grandson Jim, 85 (far right), great-grandson Andrew, 52, and great-great-granddaughter Melanie, 22, (right, centre left) pay tribute . 'It’s wonderful that this shop that helped provide for our family 100 years ago is up and running again. We live in a completely different world now and it is great to think the greengrocers will help teach future generations about how we used to live.' Clare Weston, a curator at the Black Country Living Museum, added: 'The building has been on site since 1995 but we hadn’t done much with it. Last year we decided to restore the shop to its former glory and began researching its past. 'We found out from a trade directory from 1916 that it was a greengrocers run by Gertrude Adey. After a public appeal for information Andrew Adey got in touch and it was a great surprise to him to find his family’s shop had been recreated. 'Mr Adey was able to fill us in on the history of his family and that has helped us bring the shop to life. It’s not just a greengrocers from the turn of the century, it’s a real shop with real people.'","Gertrude Adey turned home into shop when husband William was at war .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A 94-year-old war hero has branded his local council ‘Nazis’ for slapping him with a parking fine - after he left his car to help his elderly neighbour onto a bus. George Chester, who defused dozens of unexploded bombs under London during the Second World War, says he is prepared to go to prison rather than pay the £105 penalty. And he claims he has proof the ticket was issued illegally after it printed the incorrect time on the notice. Outraged: George Chester (pictured right as a bomb specialist in 1941) has branded Boston Borough Council 'Nazis' after he was fined for parking illegally for an hour. He claims he only stopped for two minutes . Controversy: Mr Chester, 94, has appealed the fine claiming he stopped at 1.54pm not 12.54pm as stated . The determined grandfather-of-nine accepts he parked in a restricted area when he dropped his elderly neighbour off at the bus station in Boston, Lincolnshire, on May 16. He claims he left the car for two minutes when he helped his neighbour board the bus and when he returned he found a yellow parking ticket slapped on his windscreen. But the time on the £35 fine claimed the violation took place at 12.54pm, when in fact he had dropped off his neighbour at 1.54pm. Despite appealing the fine - which has now risen to £105 - the council refused to back down and Mr Chester has now been warned he faces legal action if he does not cough up. But defiant Mr Chester, who lives in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, said: 'The council don’t frighten me. 'They can say what they want but I know I wasn’t anywhere near Boston at the time they say - I can prove it because my neighbour’s bus ticket states she got on the bus at 1.54pm. 'They made a mistake and they are trying to make me pay for it. 'They’re acting like bullying Nazis. Well, they don’t scare me. I dealt with a lot worse things in the war. 'I used to dig down 40 feet to defuse unexploded bombs. Some of them weighed a tonne if they’d gone up they would have taken half of London with them. 'The council should try doing that job. 'I only tell the truth, I wasn’t in Boston at 12.54. 'I’m not going to pay the fine. If I’d paid at first it would have been £35. Now, it’s £105. It’s not the cost. Defiant: The grandfather-of-nine said he will go to jail before paying the fine, which has now risen to £105 . Fighter: Mr Chester (circled), of Lincolnshire, defused bombs under London during the Second World War . 'They can take me to court. If it means going to jail then I’ll go to jail. 'When I got back to the car, the Enforcement Officer was putting the ticket on the windscreen. 'I tried to explain to him what had happened but he didn’t want to know. 'He gave me the ticket and then walked off, he was a right so-and-so. 'I was upset and it’s only when I looked at the ticket and saw it was issued at 12.54pm. 'If, as the council says, the ticket was rightly issued at 12.54pm, that means I must have parked outside the bus station for over an hour. Serving: Here he is pictured (left) with his fellow soldiers and a G mine 1000kg bomb in Italy in June 1945 . 'That’s not right, I was there two or three minutes at most. 'There are plenty of people who saw us when we were still in Horncastle at 12.54pm who will swear on oath they saw me nowhere near the bus station.' Today, Boston Borough Council, who are responsible for the bus station, refused to back down on the fine. A spokesman said: 'When Penalty Charge Notices (PCN) are issued, photographic evidence is usually taken by the Civil Enforcement Officer to evidence the offence. 'Whilst it is not appropriate to comment on individual cases in the public domain, there is a process available to anyone who wishes to dispute a PCN can ask that the matter be heard by the Traffic Penalty Tribunal which is an independent body that listens to evidence from both parties and then makes a decision on the case based on the evidence that is presented to them.'","George Chester 'parked in restricted area for two minutes to help neighbour'

"By . Mia De Graaf . Dwindling in numbers, the original Routemaster is almost a thing of the past. But nostalgic Londoners are being treated to a throwback this weekend with a fleet of the iconic buses on display. Celebrating the Routemaster Association's Diamond Jubilee Celebration, around 130 buses drove through the capital's Finsbury Park today - including the first ones ever registered. Nostalgia: Crowds clamoured to photograph a rare gathering of the first 130 Routemaster buses in London's Finsbury Park to mark the 60th anniversary of the fleet . Iconic: Buses that have been sent to France, Scotland and Germany for other uses since they stopped transporting Londoners were recalled for the convention . RM1 vehicles from as far afield as Scotland, Germany and France have been called home to join the fleet, which will take another tour tomorrow. Though some have been repainted in the years since they were used, many retain the adverts and posters of the time. Crowds lined the paths in the sun this morning watch the old double-deckers parade in convoy. Enthusiasts: Conductors and enthusiasts arrived at the event bearing vintage badges to honour the landmark occasion, which has been years in the planning . A thing of the past: The buses remained on London's streets until 2005, when bendy buses and new Routemasters were developed - though two routes still use them . Symbol of Britain: Although there are only two heritage routes that still run the original buses in London, they remain a worldwide symbol for the nation . Crowds: After a parade around Finsbury Park, in north London, the fleet lined up for spectators to get a closer look, while vintage film reels were projected on screens . Original: This rickety bus was used in London in the 1920s before trolleybuses were invented - a chunky version of the open-backed Routemasters that came in in 1954 . And the nostalgia thoroughfare was completed with old film reels projected on TV screens, memorabilia stalls, and old fashioned food stands. The first prototype was developed between 1947 and 1956, with a brief to create a lighter, fuel-efficient vehicle. Though it was three tonnes lighter than the chunky 56-seat trolleybuses, the final design managed to seat 64. Colour code: Green Routemasters worked for London Transport's country bus division, which went from the edges of London out to places including Windsor . 'Perfect design': The first prototype was developed between 1947 and 1956, with a brief to create a lighter, fuel-efficient vehicle . Revolutionary: Though it was three tonnes lighter than the chunky 56-seat trolleybuses, the final design managed to seat 64 . Through the ages: With badges from the 1950s up to an Olympic-themed 2012 badge, this conductor was decked out in Routemaster memorabilia . With the Routemaster's longevity, examples were painted to celebrate both the Queen's Silver and Golden Jubilees. In 1977, 25 Routemasters were painted silver to celebrate the Silver Jubilee and, in 2002, 50 buses were painted gold. Green Routemasters worked for London Transport's country bus division to destinations including Windsor. Celebrations: Tomorrow the bespoke fleet will parade again in a 'through the decades' special, set to draw in hundreds of fanatics from around the world . Old fashioned: More than 2,000 Routemasters were built over the decades but now only 1,000 still exist, so this scene of one driving through London is a rarity .","Original Routemasters dating back to 1954 shipped in from as far as Germany for the historic parade in London .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Parents have hit out at a junior school which took pupils as young as nine to an art gallery displaying explicit images of naked women and dead bodies. Children from Hafren Junior School were invited to Oriel Davies Gallery in Newtown in Powys, Wales, to see their own artwork, which had been placed on display. But part of the visit included a tour of the gallery’s own collection - including a collection horrifying images of women who appeared to have died violently. Horrified: Parents have hit out at Hafren Junior School for taking their children to Oriel Davies Gallery in Powys, Wales, where images of women who had died violently were displaying alongside the pupils' artwork . One shocking image in the gallery shows a bed splattered with blood stains and another appears to show the body of a dead woman slumped on a river bank. There were also several pieces of artwork involving nudity and angry parents have described the images as 'vulgar' and 'pornographic'. Stephanie Lockwood said she was horrified that the school had deemed the gallery an appropriate place for her 10-year-old daughter to visit. She fumed: 'I was mortified when I was told what she had seen. Some of the children on the trip were as young as nine. 'While at the gallery my daughter was shown what I would say is pornographic disturbing pictures. 'She is 10 years old and other class friends who also went were nine years old. 'When she came from school she told me what she had seen so I went to see the images my self. I was mortified. 'As well as the pictures there is also a video of a naked man covered in white and red paint, also there where images on the wall of what was made to look like dead people. 'I am horrified that Hafren School and the Oriel Gallery would expose my 10-year-old to these images.' Scarred: Children came home to their parents horrified after seeing an image of a blood-splattered bed and another of a naked woman slumped over the river bank in a series that the gallery defends as 'a visual display of fragility' Apology: The school for three- to 11-year-olds has been forced to apologise for the trip . Another mother, whose 10-year-old son was on the trip, added: 'It is a disgrace, surely they should have checked it out first. 'That way they could have let us know what was there and each parent could have decided if they wanted their child to go. 'My son has asked a lot of questions about death since looking at those horrible and vulgar images. He’s been scarred for life. 'It shook him up, he’s used to watching Austin and Ally or Good Luck Charlie on the Disney channel - not seeing blood soaked naked women.' Father-of-two Derek Lowe, 44, added: 'I don’t think it is right that a junior school is taking young children to view that sort of thing. 'It’s something that could corrupt young minds and stay with them for a while. 'I cannot understand their decision to take them to this sort of exhibition without doing a bit of research first.' 'It shook him up, he's used to watching the Disney channel - not seeing blood-soaked naked women' - Parent of 10-year-old pupil at Hafren Junior School in Powys, Wales . Defending the work on display, gallery director Amanda Farr said it was connected to visual artists who work with theatre, films and opera. She added: 'This exhibition is concerned with human endurance, vulnerability and the fragility of the human body. 'The exhibition is about visual artists who work with the stage. 'This includes artists who design stage sets for film, opera and the theatre, and also performance artists - some of whom use their bodies as part of their art. 'The exhibition contains one video piece by Philip Lee and some photographs of performance artists, Franko B and Anne Louise Wilson. 'These have images of the artists without clothes on. 'Oriel Davies also had a live performance by Philip Lee at the exhibition’s opening, and those who saw his performance found it a very moving and thoughtful artwork. 'It is our role as a public art gallery to show contemporary visual art in its different guises and forms, and we include performance art within this.' Headteacher Huw Jones said the gallery had an education officer who explained the context of the artwork but admitted that some parents had expressed concerns. He said: 'The school embraces opportunities for its pupils to experience art and culture as part of the national curriculum in Wales. Complaints: Parents at Hafren Junior School complained they were not warned what would be on display . 'After seeing their own work they were then shown a selection of artwork from the gallery’s own exhibition which is open to the general public. 'Some art did show nudity and surrealism but the gallery education officer, who works with schools and planned this event, was careful to explain the artwork and the context that it was to be viewed in. 'Some parents of children in our school have expressed concern about the exhibition and in light of this we have decided that no more pupils will view this particular artwork and Hafren School would like to apologise for any distress caused.' Hafren Junior School is a state school for boys and girls aged from three to 11 with 186 pupils on the books. It is situated in the centre of Newtown - a historic town in the Mid-Wales countryside - on the banks of the River Severn.","Hafren Junior School pupils taken to see their work on display in gallery .

"By . Mia De Graaf . He is revered by his people as seemingly all-powerful. But it seems North Korea is not au fait with Kim Jong Un's break dancing, arm-wrestling and skipping - on show in a spoof video that has gone viral. In a series of clearly photoshopped scenes compiled by a Chinese student, the dictator is shown cavorting in a field with Osama bin Laden, riding a pig through a snowy field, and being fly-kicked into a swimming pool by President Barack Obama. And Pyongyang is not happy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Outrage: North Korea has called on China to delete a spoof video showing Kim Jong Un doing ridiculous dances . Absurd: The three-minute video superimposes the dictators head onto a series of absurd dances . Cameo: President Obama features in a number of sketches, dancing with Kim and fly-kicking him numerous times . 'It seriously compromises Kim’s dignity and authority,' a top-ranking official from the Hermit Kingdom said, according to Asia News. North Korean are now calling on China to delete the video by a teenager named locally as Zhang - but Shanghai claims it is powerless to stop it. The video starts with Kim Jong Un's face superimposed onto a maintenance worker. While tidying fields, he drops his rake to burst into a dance - falling into the splits and backwards rolling. 'Insult': Pyongyang officials branded the video 'insulting' as Kim skips into the sunset with Osama bin Laden . Pirouettes: It seems North Korean officials are not au fait with their dictator's balletic skills . Attack: In a rare moment of victory for Kim in this video, he is seen beating up Japan's Shinzo Abe . The scene is followed by a montage of dance clips. First, Kim Jong Un as a waiter who delights crowds with his moves - before dropping his trousers and giggling excitedly. He then moonwalks down a street and pirouettes in a basketball court. Back-up dancers in the form of his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung then appear as all three perform some kind of synchronised street dance. 'Star-studded': Putin also makes an appearance in a dance off seemingly chaired by the UN's Ban Ki Moon . Embarrassing: Another scene shows the leader trying to set off a missile - which then spirals up and hits him . In the first of many face-offs with Obama, he is then shown dancing up to the American president - who kicks him to the ground. But all is well as the North Korean dictator picks himself back up and skips into the sunset with Osama bin Laden. Other scenes feature President Putin wildly shaking his hips, and a bloody battle between Kim and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.","North Korea has called on China to delete video by student called Zhang .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Benefits cheats who masterminded a £188,000 fraud after being granted asylum to stay in Britain have been jailed. Mother-of-two Nicole Mwamba and her second husband William Kapuya kept their marriage a secret to illegally claim benefits on four properties for eight years. The couple, from the Congo, also rented out one of the homes, dodged council tax, and fraudulently claimed both disability and income support. Scroll down for videos . Jailed: Nicole Mwamba, 47, and her second husband William Kapuya, also 47, have been jailed for claiming benefits on four properties in south London and Surrey as well as disability allowance and income support . It came after Nicole Mwamba, 47, and her first husband were granted political asylum in the UK on the grounds that he had been persecuted for his political beliefs. The couple claimed all his property and savings were confiscated in their native country. However, after he died his assets were all transferred to Ms Mwamba's account in the UK. Unemployed Ms Mwamba started receiving housing benefits in 1998, claiming to have no savings or assets. But in November 2004, she posed as an executive earning £42,000-a-year to land a mortgage on a two-bedroom house in Selhurst. She paid for the £18,000 deposit on the home - now worth £262,000 - using her illegally-claimed housing benefits. Later, she rented out the property and moved into an address secretly owned by her doctor brother in Upper Norwood, south east London - where she filed another benefits claim.

She told lenders she was a £57,000-a-year finance director befor eputting down a £27,000 cash deposit. Meanwhile, Mr Kapuya, 47, also claimed housing benefit at their Caterham home - as well as at a house in Brixton, south east London, and at another property in Purley, south London. He also fraudulently claimed severe disability allowance. The couple boosted their sizeable income with £736-a-month from the French welfare system via a Congolese friend in Belgium.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Award-winning EastEnders actor Khali Best punched a taxi driver in the face after refusing to pay a £61 fare on his way home from a red carpet ceremony, it is claimed. Best, who plays mechanic Dexter Harman in the BBC One soap, allegedly left 63-year-old Peter Callow with a bleeding black eye and £600-worth of damage. It came just months after he was named Best Newcomer at the National Television Awards. Scandal: Khali Best, 26, was suspended from his role as mechanic Dexter Harman (right) on EastEnders just months after winning Best Newcomer in the National Television Awards (left) for 'attacking a taxi driver' Cautioned by police for criminal damage and common assault, the 26-year-old star was also suspended from his role in EastEnders for three months following the attack in March. Best was leaving the Television and Radio Industries Club Awards at London's Grosvenor Hotel when he hailed Mr Callow's cab and asked for a lift to Enfield in north London. But he soon realised he had no money for the trip - which lasted 45 minutes and cost £61 - and began to phone friends, according to the Sun on Sunday's Dan Sales. Mr Callow told the paper: 'I told him if he had a card he could put it into the machine I had in the cab but he wasn't having any of it. 'He then said ""No, no, no"" and with that he started kicking the car door. I got round to stop him doing it and he managed to open the door and thumped me.' Left with an alleged £600-worth of damage, Mr Callow contacted police, who attended Best's flat. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers from Enfield CID investigated an allegation of assault on March 11 in Enfield.' He added that a man 'from the EN3 area attended a north London police station on 9th April and received a conditional caution for common assault and criminal damage'. Cautioned: Best, pictured in the BBC One soap, allegedly hit Peter Callow, 63, in the face to avoid paying £61 . Scandal: The attack in March came three months after Best won Best Newcomer at the National Television Awards in January. He was then suspended from his role in BBC One's EastEnders for three months . In May, it emerged the star had been suspended from his role in the soap for three months. A BBC spokesperson said: 'Khali Best has been suspended from EastEnders for three months. We will not comment any further on this matter.' Earlier that month, Khali was involved in a road collision when he crashed his £18,000 Audi A3 car in busy rush-hour morning traffic. The star’s vehicle collided with a van as Khali tried to drive past it, according to an eyewitness. EastEnders' young cast has been rocked by a series of suspensions this year, as Khali's punishment comes just months after Ricky Norwood – who plays Arthur 'Fatboy' Chubb – was also banned from filming after a video emerged of him smoking marijuana. The star, who was also alleged to have performed a sex act on camera, was suspended for two months 'for bringing the show into disrepute'. Best has yet to respond to a request for a comment from Mail Online.","Khali Best, who plays Dexter Harman, hailed taxi outside London ceremony .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May have sparked controversy after stunting a crash at the scene of a horrific car accident which killed a woman. Jane Sandalls, 26, died in a head-on collision with a newly-qualified driver who skidded on black ice at the bend on the B4437 in Charlbury, Oxfordshire. But this afternoon, the BBC's hit show used the site - a few miles from Clarkson's Oxfordshire home - as the stage for a stunt, resulting in a dramatic crash which will be screened later this year. Dramatic: Top Gear presenter James May was flown into a ditch in Charlbury, Oxfordshire, after staging a crash with Jeremy Clarkson at a bend in the road where a 26-year-old woman was killed four years ago . Tragic: Jane Sandalls (left) was killed when a newly-qualified driver skidded on black ice, hitting her Peugeot 106 head-on in January 2010. It was just a few miles from Jeremy Clarkson's Oxfordshire home . However, the move has drawn concerns from some local figures, including Woodstock councillor Victoria Edwards, who used to rehabilitate boy racers. She said: 'It is reckless and insensitive to use this spot for a stunt. 'There are plenty of places in Oxfordshire to stage a stunt. To do it at the scene of a crash is insensitive towards the family. 'The show is a very amusing one, but something like this is very serious. 'From working with boy racers, I know this kind of thing glamorises it so it is dangerous - and upsetting for relatives. 'My heart goes out to the family.' Meanwhile, fellow Woodstock councillor Emma Jay added: ‘It’s very insensitive and extremely silly and crass of them.’ The stunt saw May plough his silver Peugeot into Clarkson's black model of the same car - metres away from the scene where Ms Sandalls suffered fatal head injuries in her Peugeot 106.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Malala Yousafzai has marked her 17th birthday by visiting Nigeria to call for the release of the 219 schoolgirls still in the grip of Boko Haram militants. The Pakistani teenager has also persuaded Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan to meet the girls' parents for the first time. 'My birthday wish this year is ""Bring Back Our Girls"" now and alive,' she said, three months after the extremist group abducted almost 300 women and girls in the northeast town of Chibok. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Meeting: Malala Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012, has met with Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan in a bid to free the 219 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in April . Plea: Malala appealed directly to Boko Haram to free the 219 girls who are still missing three months on . Malala became an international figurehead . for women's rights in the face of hard-line Islam after surviving a . Taliban assassination attempt in 2012. It is the first major international summit on the matter since former prime minister Gordon Brown visited Abuja in May. Now, she is using her position in a bid to free the 219 girls still missing. Visiting some of the few who have escaped their captors, Malala appealed directly to Boko Haram. 'Lay down your weapons. Release your sisters. Release my sisters. Release the daughters of this nation. Let them be free. They have . committed no crime.' She added: 'You are misusing the name of Islam... the Quran teaches brotherhood.' Malala, who is now based in Birmingham with her family, also spoke against the custom of child brides in her home country, a . tradition common in Nigeria, too. Efforts: Malala, who is now based in Birmingham, persuaded Jonathan to visit the missing girls' relatives . After giving speeches, Malala received a welcome gift and a birthday present from Goodluck Jonathan . Emotional: Malala (right, next to her father) said it was emotional meeting the relatives of the kidnapped girls . Support: She posed for photos with grieving families and appealed directly to Boko Haram to free her 'sisters' Education: She also met with girls' education activists in Abuja to discuss how the government can invest more . Boko Haram has threatened to sell some . of the girls as brides if its fighters are not freed. 'Protect . girls from cruelty,' she said in her annual Malala Day speech, saying . girls should not be forced to marry or to leave school to become brides . 'when they should be girls,' or to give birth to children 'when they . themselves are children'. Today, Malala met with Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan and told reporters that the president 'promised me that the girls will be returned as soon as possible.' She also appealed to the Nigerian government to dedicate more money . to education and to drastically reduce the hundreds of thousands of . children who are out of school throughout the country, not just in the . area targeted by Boko Haram. The group's name means 'Western . education is sinful'. Boko Haram wants to enforce an Islamic state in . Nigeria, whose 170 million people are almost equally divided between . Christians in the south and Muslims in the north. Describing an emotional meeting with some of the girls' parents on Sunday, she said: 'I could see tears in their eyes. They were hopeless. But they seem to have this hope in their hearts,' and they were asking if they could meet the president.

Distraught: Though many of the family members drive to Abuja for rallies, Goodluck Jonathan has not visited . Jonathan has not met with any of the parents, though some regularly make the dangerous drive from Chibok to join activists who have held daily rallies in Abuja. When the activists tried to march peacefully to the presidential villa in May, they were blocked by soldiers and police. Jonathan cancelled a planned trip to Chibok that same month. On Monday, he told Malala that . criticism that his government is not doing enough 'is very wrong and . misplaced,' according to a presidential statement. 'The . great challenge in rescuing the Chibok girls is the need to ensure that . they are rescued alive,' he said, insisting his government is 'very . actively pursuing all feasible options' to achieve their safe return. Branding the crisis 'Africa's Dunblane', Gordon Brown berated world leaders for failing to act quickly to retrieve the Chibok girls. Mr Brown met with President Jonathan and the governors of state where the girls went missing.

"By . Alex Ballard . and Mia De Graaf . Jack Rowe, three, has died after being found lifeless in the swimming pool of his family home in Wiltshire . A three-year-old boy has died after being found lifeless in the swimming pool of his family's £1.2 million mansion just 20 minutes after being reported missing. Jack Rowe's parents alerted villagers across leafy Upavon in Wiltshire at 7pm on Wednesday, fearing he had wondered down to the river. But minutes later, he was discovered by a female relative face-down in the 15-square-foot swimming pool. Despite repeated attempts at CPR, Jack was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital where he was pronounced dead. They said the owners of the home, Nigel and Olivia Rowe, had been living there for a couple of years. Neighbour Jack Leach - who lives with wife Maggie, 64, in a nearby mobile home - said: 'I knew Jack was dead when we were around the pool when they tried unsuccessfully to bring him around.' Mrs Leach said the first thing they searched was the river. 'We assumed the house had been checked. He had been there half an hour before they came to us. 'The family kept saying he did not go near the water. We searched the village but he was in the house all the time. 'We were in our garden and a lady came in and said a little boy had gone missing half an hour ago. 'His name was Jack. He was later found by a girl relative. It is such a tragedy. We did all we could. If I walked passed them I would not know them.' Jack's parents, Olivia and Nigel (far right and second right), alerted villagers at 7pm yesterday fearing their child had wandered down to the river, but discovered him in the pool 20 minutes later . Mike Parr who runs the village shop said: 'A call went out for a missing child. 'There was a village search going on. Eventually he was found back at home. 'A lady asked me to call an ambulance on my mobile just before the police arrived. There were police officers trying to resuscitate him.' Villager John Stevens said: 'I feel very sorry for whoever is involved in this because I have been there. 'I lost my lad at two years nine months old I know what the situation is. That was 52 years ago. I know exactly how they are feeling.' A member of the family said: 'I am really sorry but we are not going to talk about it.' Wiltshire Police said it was working with Hampshire Police to prepare a report for the coroner.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Plea: Chief Constable Justine Curran, 46, claims police should be exempt from rules that bar parents from term time holidays as officers have to work during summer and Christmas . A police chief has called on schools to give officers' children special holiday allowance during term time. Chief Constable Justine Curran, 46, said headteachers should 'fully consider' requests from police because they are busy in the summer and at Christmas. The plea comes despite a clampdown banning parents from term time holidays except under 'exceptional circumstances'. If parents in England and Wales fail . to ensure their children attend school, they may be issued with penalty . notices of £50 to £100. Prosecution can result in a fine of up to . £2,500, a jail sentence of up to three months or a community sentence. However, in a letter to every headteacher in her area, Humberside Police chief Ms Curran said that police officers deserve to be exempt from the rules as their holiday period is 'restricted' to term times. She claims due to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Nato summit in south Wales, officers will be deprived of normal holiday leave. 'I respectfully ask therefore that any applications for term time absence are fully considered,' she added. The suggestion has sparked outrage, with critics claiming the police force is just one of many industries that has high-time at summer and Christmas. John Killeen, a representative of the . National Association of Head Teachers union, said there was . 'inflexibility in a lot of professions'. He added: . 'We have sympathy with the police service but it would make the head . teacher's position untenable with the rest if the parent body if they . started making exceptions.' Defending Ms Curran, Paul Yeomans chairman of the Humberside Police Federation said his members deserve special treatment. 'They're not able to take their leave during the peak times and it is not their fault,' he said. Yesterday figures revealed more than one . in three parents are still taking their children on holiday during term . time as they cannot afford summer rates. Crackdown: Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans that levy fines and prosecution against parents who take their children out of school during term time in a bid to avoid peak holiday fares . Justine Curran, from Sheffield, rocketed up the ranks within the space of a few years. She entered the force as a graduate, starting as a Constable in Wigan in 1989. In 1991, she was promoted to Sergeant of Greater Manchester Police, to Inspector in 1995, then to Chief Inspector in 1998. After a brief move to become Superintendent at Merseyside Police, Ms Curran returned to Manchester in 2003 to be Chief Superintendent and Divisional Commander for North Manchester Division. In the years that followed, she headed the region's Counter Terrorism Unit and controlled a £560 million budget, earning the accolade of Gold Advanced Public Order Commander. In 2010, she became the first female Chief Constable of Tayside Police in Dundee, praised with bringing a 'corporate edge' to the force. After moving to Humberside in April 2013, she was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for her work. At the same time, one in five of these . parents are fabricating emergencies to hide what they are doing - . putting their child's absence down to an invented illness. The . research by Nationwide building society also found the average family . break in Spain rockets up by £1,347 once term time ends. This compares to the current penalty of £60 for an unauthorised absence which can be increased to £2,500 if the case ends up in the courts. Yesterday, a couple in Coventry were handed criminal records and a £800 fine after taking a 13-day holiday in Australia to visit relatives as the children's grandmother was terminally ill. The tough line on punishing parents who take children out of school has been championed by the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, who said they could not afford to miss lessons if they were to achieve the results expected. He has turned the screw on parents and schools by ending a policy that allowed schools to grant up to 10 days holiday a year to families in ‘special circumstances’. The policy has caused enormous anger among parents, while a London banker has recently lodged a legal test case to challenge the law. James Haymore was summonsed to court after he refused to pay a £120 fine for taking his children to America for six days at the start of the spring term for a memorial service for their great-grandfather. Mr Haymore, who works for JP Morgan, will argue that the decision to prosecute him for taking his three children out of school is a breach of the Human Rights Act. A spokesman for the Nationwide said: ‘Given the fact that the premium for a typical holiday in Spain for a family of four could be as much as £1,347 more during school holidays compared with term-time, it’s no wonder that parents are still tempted to face the ire of their children’s head teacher, plus the threat of a fine, in order to save some significant cash.’ It looked at the cost of a holiday for a family of four with two children aged seven and nine for the first week in July, which is in term time, versus the first week in August. The cost of the same one week holiday in Spain rose from £1,508 to £2,855, which is an increase of £1,347. The price of a holiday at CenterParc in Wiltshire rose by £860 to £2,448, while the figure for Disneyland Paris went up by £369 to £2,827. Football fan: Ed McGovern, headteacher at Stafford Leys Primary School, took two weeks off work during term time to travel to Brazil . A primary school head teacher sparked outrage last month after it emerged he had taken two weeks off during term time to travel to the World Cup in Brazil. Ed McGovern, 55, was allowed to take unpaid leave from Stafford Leys Primary School in Leicester due to 'personal reasons' after enlisting the help of his union. The school did not confirm the reason for Mr McGovern's absence but parents said they found out he had gone to South America for the World Cup. A spokesman for the school said Mr McGovern has never previously made a request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been 'exemplary.' But furious parents said he should be 'setting an example', especially when they could be fined for taking their children out of school. One even called on the head teacher to resign. Businesswoman Carol-Anne Girvan, 42, whose two sons attend Stafford Leys Primary School, said: 'I think it's absolutely appalling. 'He is headteacher, he was refused permission to do this at first and had to appeal to his union I hear. 'He has a responsibility here for his pupils and he has neglected them. 'He is supposed to be setting an example to not only the students but for parents, who themselves cannot go to this kind of event. He ought to resign because of this.' Parent Kiran Kaur added: 'I don't think it is right. We parents can't do it, can we, but he can go away when he wants. I think Ofsted should be taking a good look again at the school - his leadership should be in serious question now. 'I want to know why the governors and powers that be thought that this would be OK.' It came after a headteacher in Leicester took a month off school during term time to get married. From the day her pupils returned to school after Easter, Vina Pankhania enjoyed nearly a month off – and came back just before school broke up again for summer half-term. Miss Pankhania was given permission to take a month off by governors ‘because she has worked extremely hard’. Holiday: Leicester-based headteacher Vina Pankhania, 30, (pictured with her now-husband) sparked outrage when she took a month off during term time to get married despite having 13 weeks holiday allowance . The 30-year-old, who writes of the ‘importance of respect, good manners’ and ‘high standards’ on the school’s website, went on leave from April 28 – the first day back at school after Easter. She returned to work on May 23, three days before the summer half-term holiday starts. Parents reacted with fury when they received a letter from governors telling them about her plans. One, Sonya Gilmour, said: ‘As a parent of two boys at Little Hill, I find this disgusting. How can governors approve leave just after Easter when parents themselves can be fined for similar actions? 'Surely the summer time off she has is big enough to accommodate a wedding.’ Miss Pankhania refused to comment.","Chief Constable Justine Curran said police cannot take holiday in summer .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A prisoner was mistakenly freed from an open prison because he had the same surname as an inmate who was due for release that day. Anthony Douglas, who is in his 20s, strolled out of HMP Hewell in Worcestershire last Wednesday instead of another convict who had completed his sentence. It is understood a senior member of staff was suspended after the mistake at the prison - where a killer managed to escape last year. Blunder: Anthony Douglas walked out of HMP Hewell in Worcestershire (pictured) while still serving time after a member of staff confused him with another prisoner who was due to be released and had the same surname . Officers managed to track down and arrest the convict the next day and he is now back in jail. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'A prisoner from Hewell was released in error on July 2. 'The police were notified immediately and he was recaptured on July 3. 'An investigation by a senior governor has been launched. 'We take public protection extremely seriously and this type of incident is a very rare but regrettable occurrence.' Douglas, who is originally from Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, is thought to have spent time at the high-security psychiatric unit Ashworth Hospital in Liverpool, where one-eyed killer Dale Cregan was admitted. It is unclear how long Douglas had left on his sentence when he escaped or what he had been convicted of. The embarrassing gaffe is the latest in a string of controversial incidents at the jail - which holds Category B, C and D inmates. Under pressure: The mistake is the latest in a series of accidental prison breaks this year despite Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's vow to tighten the rules and increase security to prevent any more escapes . Scores of prisoners have wandered free thanks to blunders by prison staff this year. In May, mental patient David Burslam, who was convicted of kidnapping, fled when he was taken for a stroll outside Cheswold Park Hospital in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. It came after the 'Scarborough Slasher' Damien Burns, 39, and convicted thief Dean Jackson, 27, fled Category D prison HMP Hatfield, also in Doncaster. Their escape was just a fortnight after Michael 'Skull Cracker' Wheatley broke free from an open prison in Kent. Murderer Arnold Pickering, 44, went on the run from Category C jail HMP Kennet in Merseyside in May but was later arrested for being unlawfully at large in Oldham. Robber Thomas Moffett, 51, was also arrested after escaping on the same day. Since 2010, 18 convicts have absconded, but the Prison Service continues to refuse to reveal their identities, suggesting it does not believe the information is of public interest. In October last year, murderer Alan Giles who was serving two life sentences for kidnapping and killing a teenager went on the run from the prison. The 56-year-old was jailed for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old student Kevin Ricketts, who was killed in January 1995. He had been allowed out on day release to work at a charity shop before absconding and was eventually recaptured after nine days on the run. Giles was sentenced to a further six months in prison in January this year after admitting escaping from lawful custody. And last month police re-arrested a man from Sandwell, West Midlands, who failed to return to the prison while on day release. The 33-year-old was serving a four-year sentence for burglary when he went missing after being allowed to travel to West Bromwich, West Mids. HMP Hewell was created in June 2008 in a merger of the three former prisons at the site - Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange. The prison primarily serves the Worcestershire, West Midlands and Warwickshire areas. Part of the establishment is an open prison but it was not believed Douglas was an inmate in that section. Earlier this year Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced plans to tighten rules surrounding day release from open prisons after a series of controversies about AWOL prisoners. New measures could include fitting electronic tags to prisoners on day release and more stringent risk assessment before day passes are approved.","Anthony Douglas, in his 20s, strolled out of HMP Hewell last Wednesday .

"By . Vanessa Allen . Former tabloid reporter Dan Evans arriving at the Old Bailey in central London yesterday where he gave evidence in the phone hacking trial . A journalist who hacked Sienna Miller’s ‘I love you’ message to Daniel Craig told yesterday how he turned to drink and drugs to cope with his depression over phone hacking. Dan Evans, 38, said he began ‘self-medicating’ with cocaine and alcohol as he struggled to cope with his role as a notorious phone hacker, first at the Sunday Mirror and then at the News of the World. He claimed he offered to help police and prosecutors investigate the ‘enormous conspiracy’ surrounding illegal hacking because he wanted ‘to begin my life again with a clean slate’. Evans signed a deal with the Crown Prosecution Service in which he agreed to cooperate with the investigation and give evidence at the phone hacking trial in the hope of getting a reduced sentence for his own role. He told lawyers that hacking was an ‘open secret’ at the News of the World and that the tabloid’s former editor Andy Coulson ‘knows exactly what went on on his watch’. Evans told the court he was an unwilling hacker but felt he had no choice but to continue because of the pressure he was under when his career began to stall. He started drinking in the afternoons and taking cocaine, he said. Evans has previously admitted two convictions linked to his ‘extensive’ drug use. He said the fall-out from the scandal had left him needing therapy for 18 months, saying: ‘Carrying an enormous secret and delving illegally into the lives of people who didn’t deserve it made me unhappy.’ Timothy Langdale, for Coulson, suggested that Evans had willingly hacked phones because he was a ‘failing journalist’. Evans conceded he had hacked ‘to get stories to keep my head above water’, and said Coulson had known about stories generated from hacking, joking that ‘even the office cat knew’ what was going on. Mr Langdale suggested Evans had only made potentially damaging allegations about Coulson’s involvement after he had received legal advice that he would be ‘a good candidate for getting immunity from prosecution’ if he gave police information about senior journalists. However, the CPS refused to give him full immunity from prosecution over fears that striking such a  deal would make his evidence ‘almost worthless’. He accepted a deal in which the CPS will give full details of his cooperation to the judge when he appears for sentencing. Evans arriving at court on Tuesday: Timothy . Langdale, for Andy Coulson, suggested Evans had willingly hacked phones . because he was a 'failing journalist' - and that he had implicated his former editor to get immunity . Evans has admitted hacking at the Sunday Mirror and the News  of the World, conspiring to commit misconduct and lying in a witness statement. Coulson denies charges of conspiring to hack phones and commit misconduct. All seven defendants in the trial, including former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Large oil deposits have been discovered under southern England which could equal a third of the North Sea reserves but would need fracking to extract it . Scientists have discovered potential onshore oil resources in South East England, a new report is expected to confirm. Oil-bearing shale rocks in the Weald area spanning parts of Sussex, Hampshire, Kent and Surrey are believed to be as rich in oil as the North Sea fields. The area could hold reserves to equal a third of those under the North Sea, which would offer Britain greater energy security and could help to drive down prices. But it would have to be extracted by fracking - the controversial technique which uses high-pressure water to split rocks - and attempts to exploit it risk an angry response from campaigners. A report into the ‘Jurassic Weald Basin’ reserve has been prepared by the British Geological Survey and passed to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, and could be made public within weeks. A similar study in the North of England estimated there may be more than 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas and experts said it could power Britain for 50 years. The new study also looked for shale gas in the South, but was reported to have found that oil was the biggest potential resource under the Weald. Richard Selley, professor of petroleum exploration at Imperial College London, who will advise the DECC on the report, told The Sunday Times: ‘The discovery of oil in the Weald should not be a surprise because there is already a number of small oilfields around the North and South Downs and also oil seeps. ‘The amount is likely to be less than under the North Sea, which is a far larger area, and it is not yet possible to be clear about the figures because we don’t know how much of what is down there. But it is clear that these rocks have a high oil content.’ Large deposits of oil-rich rock have been discovered across Kent (pictured), Surrey, Sussex and Hamps. Plans for energy firm Europa Oil & Gas to sink exploratory wells in an area of outstanding natural beauty near Dorking, Surrey, have already prompted legal protests by the Leith Hill Action Group. Cuadrilla faced protests by environmental campaigners when it tried to drill exploratory wells at Balcombe in West Sussex. Campaigners say drilling could scar the countryside, pollute water supplies and clog roads with hundreds of lorries. The Weald Basin spans traditionally Conservative areas and the Government faces a dilemma between Britain’s energy needs and a community backlash ahead of next year’s election. Southern England already has Europe’s biggest onshore oil field at Wytch Farm in Dorset, where 400million barrels of oil have been extracted since the 1970s.","Oil-rich rock deposits found in Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire .

Before: Photograph shows Mark and his wife Sharon on January 28 2014 after the couple had pumped out a couple of inches of water after initial flooding, making their house dry at the time . So the 62-year-old returned by kayak to the property in Fordgate, Somerset, to rescue what he could. He . found the building flooded with their once pristine cream-coloured . sofas floating in a sea of muddy brown water to the depth of four feet.

Mark Corthine locks his door after returning to his home wearing a dry suit in the flooded abandoned home . Mr . and Mrs Corthine, who is 61, were on holiday in Australia when the . flooding hit their £300,000 home on the edge of the Somerset Levels last . month. They cut their break . short to fly home in the hope of pumping the water out, but were forced . to abandon the attempt and evacuated the property last week as the . water level continued to rise. The . house-proud couple left their furniture on makeshift stilts in the hope . it would keep it out of the flood. Photograph albums were left on top . of cabinets. But the tide rose mercilessly, engulfing their possessions and contaminating their water supply. Last . year’s flood caused £31,000 worth of damage and forced them out of . their home for four months while it was replastered, redecorated and the . oak wood floor was replaced.

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Luke Salkeld . Jonas Stadden collapsed and died on November 24 last year . A boy of four died in a foster home after social workers removed him from his parents. Jonas Stadden, who had Down’s syndrome, collapsed and died after he was taken into care by a council criticised for its ‘inadequate’ child protection services. His devastated parents say they had repeatedly raised questions about his standard of care, but claim their fears were dismissed. Jonas’s mother Sara Russell, 47, said: ‘Jonas could have been saved if anyone had listened to us, his parents. Every time we tried to tell them something was wrong we were ignored.     ‘They’ve killed our little boy by not listening to what we said.’ Jonas was taken into care in April last year after his mother contacted social services at Somerset council about an unrelated matter. The full details cannot be reported but Miss Russell said she was told the interim care order was temporary and would mean the council would still have to consult her over her son’s care. A source at the council confirmed that Jonas was in good health when he was taken from his parents. Two months later an Ofsted inspection of Somerset’s child protection service judged it to be ‘inadequate’. And a month before Jonas’s death, his parents went to court in an unsuccessful bid to have him removed from his foster placement. They felt he was not receiving proper . medication for sores, bruises and sunburn. The local authority has admitted the boy was in good health when it was granted a court order to take him from his parents Haydn Stadden and Sara Russell . The couple, from Taunton, . also complained that he was left in soiled nappies, was not properly . dressed in winter and was allowed to sleep alone despite suffering . breathing problems. His . father Haydn Stadden, 48, claimed that the last time he saw Jonas, in . November last year, he was hot, flushed, lethargic and suffering from . conjunctivitis. Mr Stadden said he was assured his son would get . medical attention. But just four days later, Jonas collapsed at his . foster home. An ambulance was called but paramedics were unable to save . him. Miss Russell was told . he had died when four police officers arrived at the couple’s home, but . was not allowed to see her son’s body until the next day. She . told the Daily Mail: ‘If someone had contacted us, we might have been . able to see him before he died and hold him for the last time. He might . have known his Mummy and Daddy were with him.’ A . council spokesman said the case was ‘complex’, adding: ‘We have . complete confidence in the foster carers who looked after him.’ Jonas’s . death is still under investigation and the results of a post-mortem . examination are expected next month.

'Punch-up': According to Constance Briscoe, Vicky Pryce, left, attacked Chris Huhne, right, in their £2.5million townhouse in Clapham, south west London . 'Relations with men': Chris Huhne, pictured right at the 2010 general election, allegedly gave Vicky Pryce, left, an STD. Pryce also allegedly said their marriage collapsed because he had had gay relationships in the past . She said the senior economist had . likened Mr Huhne’s lover to a man, and had claimed he had had gay . relationships. She added: ‘Vicky’s attitude was that Chris had run off . with a man.’ Miss Pryce wanted to give a ‘tell-all’ newspaper interview, former confidante Briscoe said. Briscoe, . Britain’s best known black female judge, was giving evidence in her own . defence against accusations she lied to police over her role in the . speeding points scandal which led to both Mr Huhne and Miss Pryce being . jailed. She told Southwark . Crown Court she had believed Miss Pryce should go ahead with the . newspaper interview because it would be ‘good therapy’. Briscoe, . 56, said Miss Pryce had told her in 2003 that Mr Huhne had asked her to . take his speeding points to avoid losing his driving licence. She . said: ‘At that time I thought it was in the public interest for Chris . to have to give an account of himself. I felt he was a bit of a . hypocrite. Claims: Constance Briscoe, pictured left at court today, revealed details of alleged conversations with Vicky Pryce, right . ‘He was a . politician playing fast and loose with speeding points. He was . expressing ambitions to become deputy prime minister and he was telling . lies.’ Briscoe, a former . barrister and part-time judge, said she knew Miss Pryce because they . lived on the same affluent Georgian estate in Clapham, south west . London, and their children were friends. She told the court that Miss Pryce did not mention the speeding points again until after their marriage break-up in 2010. Following . the split, Briscoe said the whole street  witnessed a furious argument . between the pair, dubbed the ‘double punch-up black eye make-up . episode’. Affair: Hune, right, left Vicky Pryce for his bisexual lover Carina Trimingham, left . She said: ‘Chris . had come back to the crescent to see Vicky and she punched him and . blackened his eye. I saw it, the whole of the crescent saw it. She . dragged him through a window and punched him a few times in the eye. ‘Vicky . had given him quite a few good punches and it had landed well. He had . to cover it up because he was on telly all the time. 'Family values': Briscoe told jurors that Pryce was angry with Chris Huhne for conducting a campaign based on family values while having an affair. Pictured is an election campaign leaflet showing a Huhne family photograph . ‘When Chris had driven round to go back out [of the crescent], she punched him again – that was the double punch-up.’ It . was not made clear if Briscoe was referring to Miss Pryce dragging Mr . Huhne through a car window, although at least one punch appears to have . been thrown while he was driving. Briscoe said Miss Pryce had wanted to . speak to a journalist from The Mail on Sunday but believed Mr Huhne had . bugged their home and hacked her emails, so asked her neighbour to act . as her intermediary. The . lawyer said she forwarded emails and messages between the Greek-born . economist and journalists Andrew Alderson and Dave Dillon. Briscoe, . a former Samaritans counsellor, added: ‘Apart from the breakdown of the . relationship and blaming Chris Huhne’s sexuality, she wanted to discuss . the fact that Chris had had relationships with men before they got . married and all of that. ‘She . also wanted to discuss when he had infected her with a sexually . transmitted disease when he was a Euro MEP, and when she had confronted . him with that, he said he got it from clean sheets in a hotel.’ Briscoe . told the jury she had acted as an intermediary in discussions with The . Mail on Sunday, but was not involved with Miss Pryce’s dealings with The . Sunday Times. A police . investigation was launched in 2011 after both newspapers ran allegations . that Mr Huhne had asked a family member to take his speeding points, . and the subsequent scandal led to the MP’s resignation. Mr Huhne and Miss Pryce were each jailed for eight months last year. Briscoe . is charged with  perverting the course of  justice by making . ‘inaccurate and misleading’ witness statements, and of falsifying a . document. She denies the allegations, but has been  suspended from the . judiciary since her arrest in 2012. The trial continues.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Generous readers have donated more than £92,500 to the Daily Mail's Christmas Appeal for Sue Ryder hospices. The money will be used to help families as they cope with a dying relative's final days, whether in a dedicated hospice or with support at home. The national charity provides a range of services including end-of-life care in hospices, nurses to provide pain relief at home and bereavement counselling for children. Daily Mail readers have donated more than £92,500 to the paper's Christmas Appeal for Sue Ryder hospices . Sue Ryder chief executive Heidi Travis said the Mail's support would make an 'immeasurable' difference to people's lives. 'We believe that towards the end of their lives everyone should receive the care they want,' she said. 'Most people would like to die at home or in a hospice, pain-free and surrounded by family and friends. Sadly this isn't always the case. Through readers' amazing response, we will continue to be able to provide care and support to people nearing the end of their lives in our hospices and local communities. 'Sue Ryder's vision is to make incredible care available to all, no matter where they live or what their circumstances are. The Daily Mail Christmas Appeal is a significant step towards making this a reality.' Over our four-week appeal, the Mail highlighted the hospices' work in providing specialist care so families can be with loved ones in their last days. The appeal has raised at least £92,500 and a spokesman said the total amount collected was not yet known. The total so far is enough to pay for almost 12,000 hours of end-of-life care in one of the charity's hospices. Sue Ryder chief executive Heidi Travis said the Mail's support would make an 'immeasurable' difference to people's lives. Pictured here is a Sue Ryder Care charity shop in Downham Market, Norfolk . It would fund more than 2,600 home visits from a Sue Ryder nurse to provide pain relief, or 4,600 bereavement counselling sessions for grieving children. Sue Ryder also helps people living with long-term conditions in neurological care centres and provides support to their families to help them live at home. More than 60 per cent of its funding comes from voluntary donations and the charity has warned it could not continue its work without such support.","Money will be used to help families cope with dying relative's final days .

"By . Vanessa Allen . and David Wilkes . In the saddle: Ben Maher is expected to deny all allegations . An Olympic gold medallist showjumper has been accused of pocketing £700,000 in secret payments on horse deals. Ben Maher was yesterday accused of ripping off his backers over an eight-year partnership. Mike and Emma Phillips, credited with helping him to victory at the London Games, say they are ‘broken hearted and utterly betrayed’ and are suing him in the High Court. The stud owners are demanding that the horse he rode to team gold in 2012, Tripple X, be sold, as they claim that they are its co-owners. According to papers lodged at the High Court, they claim Mr Maher, 30, the world number two in showjumping, owes them nearly £700,000. Mr and Mrs Phillips, of Quainton Stud in Buckinghamshire, claim he lied about the value of horses that he suggested they buy and sell, pocketing vast sums of ‘secret profit’. Mrs Phillips, 43, said: ‘We are totally shocked at the abuse of our trust and support. We treated Ben as one of our family, working with him since 2005... 'We did all we could to provide the conditions that led to Ben’s fantastic success at the Olympics last year and now feel broken hearted and utterly betrayed.’ Matthew Collings QC, for the pair, said: ‘Mr and Mrs Phillips acquired, and disposed of, a number of horses on the advice and with the assistance of Mr Maher, including horses for the purpose of helping with Mr Maher’s showjumping career and in particular his preparation for... the London 2012 Olympics.’ Mrs Phillips said she offered to let Mr Maher ride her horses in 2005. As the couple came to trust him, he acted as their agent in deals to buy and sell horses, including those with which he wanted to compete. Stud owners Mike and Emma Phillips (above), credited with helping Maher to victory at the London Games, say they feel 'utterly betrayed' and are suing him in the High Court . They claim the trouble began in 2006 . when he told them about a ‘promising’ horse, Quirifino, which he was . ‘enthusiastic’ for them to buy. Mr and Mrs Phillips agreed to pay 140,000 euros (£117,000) and claim Quirifino’s owner then paid at least £8,300 to Mr Maher. A year later Mr Maher was again ‘enthusiastic’ about a horse called Awanti and the couple agreed to pay 190,000 euros (£160,000) for it, including more than £40,000 in cash, which they claim he kept. In 2008 – the year Mr Maher rode in his first Olympics in Beijing – they allege he told them a horse called Robin Hood was on sale for £230,000 when its true price was about £70,000. The stud owners are demanding that the horse Maher rode to team gold in 2012, Tripple X, be sold, as they claim that they are its co-owners. Above, Maher in the Olympic equestrian jumping finals at Greenwich Park on Tripple X . They say they paid him £115,000 for a half share. The papers claim the deceptions involved six horses and continued until 2012. Mr and Mrs Phillips are suing for almost £700,000 plus interest and damages and want the court to look at whether they are owed a share of prize money. The total could be some £1.5million if their case is successful. Mr Maher was yesterday competing in the Paris Gucci Masters. A spokesman said he would not comment until his defence papers had been filed with the High Court. Horse and Hound magazine reported he was expected to deny the allegations.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Charles Saatchi bought 12 identical suits so he could dress the same way every day, according to the Grillos . Owning just one suit costing £1,000 is quite an investment for most men, but Charles Saatchi bought 12 identical ones so he could dress the same way every day. He would team the Paul Smith suits with one of 25 white shirts, each costing £155 from Prince Charles’s shirt-maker Turnbull & Asser, according to his former housekeepers. Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo revealed how the multi-millionaire advertising tycoon is ruled by obsessive routines so he accumulates large quantities of identical items – from suits to bottles of lemonade, and from TV remotes to tubes of hair gel. They also told how the favourite possession of Mr Saatchi and his then wife Nigella Lawson was a stuffed bulldog called Narles – and how he requested burnt toast every time he ate breakfast. The sisters said Mr Saatchi ordered them to stockpile his favourite drinks – cloudy lemonade from Waitrose and ready-made Frappuccino drinks from Starbucks. The 70-year-old even told staff to pack bottles of the drinks in his suitcases every time he went away and he once demanded his staff buy 12 Apple TV remote controls at £15 each so he could always find one. The Grillos – who were last week cleared of a £695,000 credit card fraud against their former employers – said their life working for Mr Saatchi and the ‘domestic goddess’ was governed by a series of bizarre orders. Each day started at 6am, they claimed, so they could hide any trace of Miss Lawson’s cookery or late-night takeaways as Mr Saatchi insisted that the kitchen should always be spotless. He demanded a breakfast of burnt toast and a cup of weak tea every day at 7am. However, first he would cut his own hair each morning before applying his favourite Philip B Crème of the Crop hair gel. At the weekend, Mr Saatchi would book the same outside table at Scott's - the Mayfair restaurant where he was pictured grabbing Nigella Lawson's (pictured)throat during a row this summer . He told staff to buy 60 tubes of the £30 gel so that he would never run out of it. Next he would put on one of the designer outfits that he had in his wardrobe. The Grillo sisters said the tycoon – worth an estimated £135million – only dressed in the identical suits from British designer Paul Smith, which he would team with the Turnbull & Asser shirts. The uniform would be completed by one of 30 pairs of £290 black suede Totes loafers and a cashmere Calvin Klein coat. Mr Saatchi lunched in a private room at Montpeliano restaurant in Knightsbridge, West London, on weekdays. At the weekend he booked the same outside table at Scott’s in Mayfair – the restaurant where he was pictured grabbing Miss Lawson’s throat during a row this summer. Miss Grillo said the tycoon also demanded the heating was kept on year-round at their townhouse, even if the sweltering heat meant staff had to leave windows open. He hated rooms being dark so insisted every light in the house was kept on all day. The sisters worked for the couple from 2001 and said Saatchi shipped in a special strong toothpaste, Clinomyn, from the US where it is popular with smokers. He also kept a bag of cash on top of the fridge so staff could use it for his requests, including buying supplies of eggs. The Grillo sisters said staff were also sent to nearby Annabel’s nightclub to fetch bottles of his favourite red wine from the club’s cellars. Francesca Grillo described how she would spend hours ensuring Mr Saatchi’s whims were obeyed. She added: ‘It took me ages to turn all the lights off at night, but Charles hated it being dark. He also like the heating on all the time so we’d keep the windows open.’","Grillos revealed how Charles Saatchi bought 12 identical £1,000 Paul Smith suits, along with 25 white shirts, so he could dress the same every day .

"By . Vanessa Allen . As Britain’s best-known entrepreneur he has not been shy of wrapping himself – and his airline – in the Union flag. But billionaire Sir Richard Branson has quit the UK to live full-time on his holiday island in a Caribbean tax haven, it was revealed yesterday. The Virgin tycoon said he and wife Joan had chosen to move permanently to Necker as it allowed them to ‘live life to the full’ and enabled him to pursue hobbies including kite-surfing, tennis and pilates. Saying goodbye: Sir Richard Branson has draped himself in the Union Flag to promote his business in the past. He is pictured here in Dubai in 2006. Now he is living on his holiday island of Necker in the British Virgin Islands . The 63-year-old denied reports he had . left Britain to become a tax exile, saying he was too wealthy to allow . tax considerations to dictate where he should live. The . British Virgin Islands have an income tax rate of zero, rather than the . 45 per cent top rate in the UK. Sir Richard said: ‘I have not left . Britain for tax reasons, but for my love of the beautiful British Virgin . Islands and in particular Necker Island... We feel it gives me and my . wife Joan the best chance to live another productive few decades. We can . also look after our health. ‘There is no better place to stay active and I can kite-surf, surf, play tennis, swim, do pilates and just play.’ Sir Richard previously lived in a 200-acre Oxfordshire estate and a mansion in Holland Park, West London. The . London property was sold almost seven years ago and documents lodged . with the Land Registry show the Oxfordshire estate was sold to his . children, Holly and Sam, for £1.35million in August last year. Home sweet home: Sir Richard is now living on his holiday island of Necker in the British Virgin Islands . Inside the home: A spokesman for Virgin Group founder Sir Richard said he had been in Necker for seven years . Blaze: The property on Necker Island had to be rebuilt after parts were destroyed by a house fire in August 2011 . Sir . Richard, who is worth an estimated £3.5billion, has previously . criticised wealthy individuals who left Britain to escape high tax . rates. Earlier this year he said Britain’s tax regime was ‘very . reasonable’ when compared to countries such as France, where high . earners pay 80 per cent tax, and said it would be wrong for Chancellor . George Osborne to lower rates for the wealthy. In . a statement on the Virgin website yesterday, he said: ‘I have been very . fortunate to accumulate so much wealth in my career, more than I need . in my lifetime, and would not live somewhere I don’t want to for tax . reasons.’ Sir Richard will . continue to pay tax on any UK income but Virgin Group Holdings, which . encompasses his business empire, is controlled by family trusts based in . the BVI, according to The Sunday Times. From above: Sir Richard sold his Oxfordshire mansion to his children Holly, 31, and Sam, 28, for £1.35million in August last year - but the transfer is said to have taken place up to five years ago . Siblings: Holly and Sam, children of Sir Richard Branson, pictured at London's Royal Albert Hall in January 2008 . Although . he remains the public face of Virgin he said he now devoted the vast . majority of his time to not-for-profit ventures and charity. Sir Richard . added: ‘The companies... have created tens of thousands of jobs and . paid hundreds of millions in tax (and will continue to do so)... I also . travel the world sharing what I’ve learned by doing speeches and trying . to help the next generation of entrepreneurs. ‘One . hundred per cent of any monies I earn from these engagements I give to . charity.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Golfer Colin Montgomerie was violent towards his ex-wife Eimear, the phone hacking trial was told yesterday. His former wife said she had told then Sun editor Rebekah Brooks about a ‘violent event’ in a hotel room when the women had met for lunch. Eimear Cook, who has since remarried, claimed that, during the conversation, Brooks, 45, had described how she was herself arrested over an alleged assault on her ex-husband, actor Ross Kemp. Golfer Colin Montgomerie was violent towards his ex-wife Eimear, the phone hacking trial has been told . Mrs Cook, 43, told the Old Bailey that the newspaper boss had gone on to discuss how it was ‘easy’ to hack phones. In a dramatic courtroom exchange, Mrs Cook was accused of lying in her evidence and was asked if she had a ‘vendetta’ against Brooks. Mrs Cook sued the News of the World after discovering her phone was hacked, but she denied she had lied about Brooks to support her civil claim for damages. Mrs Cook met Brooks for lunch in 2005 following her split from Ryder Cup captain Montgomerie, 50. Mrs Cook, 43, told the Old Bailey Rebekah Brooks had told her how it was 'easy' to hack phones . She told police: ‘[Brooks] was quite a frank and open person, she told us about the assault on her husband Ross Kemp, how the police had been called and that it had made it into the papers.’ She went on: ‘I can’t remember how the subject of phone hacking came up... Rebekah said she couldn’t believe how these incredibly wealthy people didn’t change their factory-set Pins and how stupid their PAs were for not telling them to change their Pins. ‘She gave an example involving Paul McCartney and Heather Mills. She said that it was through listening to voicemails that it was found out that he had thrown her engagement ring from the  balcony of a New York hotel room several floors up.’ The prosecution allege the conversation shows Brooks was aware of phone hacking, a claim she denies. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Brooks, accused Mrs Cook of lying about the conversation in September 2005, and told her: ‘This never happened.’ Mrs Cook denied lying and said she recalled vividly how Brooks had laughed as she talked about coverage of her alleged assault on Kemp. The lawyer told her: ‘It’s not just a suggestion that it never happened, it couldn’t have happened, it’s quite impossible for this to have happened. ‘Mrs Brooks was not the subject of an accusation of an assault on Ross Kemp until November 2005... this event had not happened, it wouldn’t happen for another few weeks.’ Mr Laidlaw added: ‘I suggest  what happened was you told Mrs Brooks your ex-husband Mr Montgomerie had been violent towards you in your marriage.’ ‘Yes I did,’ she replied. She agreed she had told Brooks there was ‘something of a record of this violent event’ taking place in a hotel room. But she denied she had asked the tabloid editor if she could run an article about it, or discussed giving an affidavit to support such an article. Eimear Cook has remarried since splitting with the golfer (pictured) Mrs Cook insisted she had tried not to speak to journalists – but was confronted with articles apparently based on interviews with her, including two spreads in Hello! and a series of articles in the Daily Mail. She said the Hello! interview was given while she was married to Montgomerie and accepted a level of public interest, and said the Mail articles were based on comments made to journalists at society events. She also conceded she had accepted several commissions from the Mail on Sunday to write travel features. Brooks and others deny conspiracy to hack phones. The trial continues.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Case: Kate McCann arrives at Lisbon's civil court today for the start of the family's libel action against Goncalo Amaral . Kate McCann wept in court yesterday as . friends described her ‘utter despair’ in the days after her daughter . Madeleine disappeared. Mrs . McCann, 45, brushed away tears as her family’s torment was played out on . the first day of a libel trial against the Portuguese policeman who led . the botched hunt for Madeleine. Accusations . by former detective Goncalo Amaral that Mrs McCann and her husband . Gerry faked Madeleine’s abduction and then tried to make money from it . engulfed the couple in a ‘massive tidal wave of lies’, their friends . told the court. Mrs McCann . told friends she was ‘devastated’ by his book, in which he claimed . Madeleine, then three, died in an accident in her family’s Algarve . holiday apartment and the couple staged her disappearance to cover up . their negligence – accusations the McCanns vehemently deny. The . couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, launched £1million libel . proceedings against Mr Amaral, who was sacked as the head of the . investigation after he launched an outspoken attack on British police. Their . friend Susan Hubbard, the wife of an Anglican minister who counselled . the McCanns after Madeleine’s disappearance from a holiday resort in . Praia da Luz, said: ‘The thought that most people in Portugal thought . Madeleine was dead was devastating for both Kate and Gerry – and the . thought that was added, that they had something to do with it.’ Mrs . McCann, a GP, cried as the court heard she was unable to eat and . constantly wept in the days after Madeleine’s disappearance on May 3, . 2007. But Mrs Hubbard, 46, said Mrs McCann’s despair turned to ‘anger . and surprise’ after the couple were named as arguidos – or suspects – by . the Portuguese police. Mrs McCann is being accompanied by her friend Susan Hubbard for the first hearing of the case against Mr Amaral, who published a book making allegations about Madeleine's disappearance . Mrs McCann (left) is suing the Portuguese ex-police chief (right) for the book, titled 'Maddie: The Truth of The Lie', which accuses her of staging her daughter's disappearance, despite a lack of evidence .

Crime scene: The Ocean Club Resort in Praia da Luz where Madeleine went missing in 2007 . Unsolved: Kate and Gerry McCann hold a news conference to mark the 5th anniversary of the disappearance of their daughter . Mr . Amaral’s book, The Truth Of The Lie, was published three days after the . Portuguese authorities formally closed the investigation in 2008 and . cleared the couple as suspects. The McCanns’ lawyer, Isabel Duarte, said . it also contained claims that the family’s ‘Find Madeleine’ fund could . be fraudulent. Allegations: Mr Amaral poses with his book 'Maddie:The Truth of the Lie' The fund . raised £2million in public donations and was used to pay for the search . for Madeleine to continue after the Portuguese case was closed. A . private detective who worked for the fund said he received abuse instead . of information after Mr Amaral’s book soured public opinion against the . McCanns. Another friend, . documentary-maker Emma Loach, the daughter of film director Ken Loach, . said the book contained a ‘massive tidal wave of lies’. She . added: ‘If people believe Madeleine is dead they won’t look for her, . and if people believe Kate and Gerry were involved they won’t help them. ‘Imagine . the public believing that you covered up your child’s death and then . sought to make money out of it. They feel shame, humiliation and . anguish.’ Mr Amaral’s book sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the McCanns won an injunction against him. Mrs . McCann attended the hearing at Lisbon’s civil court alone as her . husband, a heart surgeon, remained in Britain to work and look after . Madeleine’s brother and sister, eight-year-old twins Sean and Amelie. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs McCann said: ‘I am here today for Madeleine and, I strongly hope, for justice. ‘I’m . here to stop the damage that has been caused and is still being caused . in the search for our daughter, and to stop the suffering that has been . caused to our family by the theories of Goncalo Amaral.’ The case continues.

"By . Vanessa Allen . A sick toddler died in hospital after he was denied a potentially life-saving test because it was ‘not normally done’ at weekends, an inquest heard yesterday. Doctors did not give two-year-old Dylan Brown a test for heart disease. They said he showed no symptoms of heart failure and they believed he was suffering from a virus. But the toddler later died after suffering three cardiac arrests in hospital. Dylan Brown died in Hillingdon Hospital (pictured), Uxbridge, west London, on May 13 last year after suffering three cardiac arrests . An expert said his treatment would have been different if the echocardiogram (ECG) test had been given. It would have revealed Dylan’s underlying heart problem and would have meant he was given a different drug. But his consultant paediatrician, Dr . Nagi Barakat, told the inquest the test ‘was not done because it was the . weekend and they are not normally done at the weekend’. And Dr Shankar Sridharan, the heart . specialist who said Dylan’s treatment would have been different if the . ECG had been given, also said there was no clinical evidence at the time . to suggest the toddler needed this test. Coroner Lorna Tagliavini said . Hillingdon Hospital in Uxbridge, West London, had not failed and said . Dylan was treated ‘appropriately’. As attempts were made to resuscitate the toddler, his parents were not allowed into the room with him . But his family said ‘big mistakes’ were made and blamed out-of-hours shortages. After the inquest, his . grandfather, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The whole NHS just closes . up shop at 5pm on Friday and doesn’t open up again until Monday . morning. It is disgraceful: don’t get sick at the weekend. Dylan was admitted to Hillingdon Hospital with breathing difficulties and cold-like symptoms on Wednesday, May 9 last year. He was vomiting and his heart was . beating quickly but staff thought he was suffering from a virus and did . not give him an ECG test, which uses soundwaves to create a picture of . the heart. He had an underlying muscle condition which was diagnosed . from his birth and had undergone an ECG a year earlier. West London Coroner’s Court heard that . another ECG after his admission at Hillingdon would probably have . revealed the new problem in his heart. Christine Mann, the hospital's matron and nursing services manager, apologised to Dylan's parents, saying one reason they were excluded was because of staff shortages . But it was not performed and by the . time doctors realised his condition was critical – four days after his . admission – he was suffering heart failure. By the Saturday, the day before he . died, his heart was racing and his eyes were puffy, which can be a . symptom of an underlying heart problem. But he was still playing in his . cot and showed no signs of heart failure. Dr Barakat said: ‘The following day . [Sunday] when I came in to see him, he looked very unwell. His liver was . enlarged and his heart rate was very high. It was then I realised . something needed to be done urgently.’ Dr Barakat tried to arrange for Dylan . to be taken to a hospital ‘set up for intensive care’ but the toddler . went into cardiac arrest while he was on the phone and was put on a . ventilator to help him breathe. Dylan suffered two more cardiac arrests and Dr Barakat said the decision was taken to stop his ventilator. Dr Sridharan, of Great Ormond Street . Hospital in Central London, said an ECG would have helped but insisted . there was no reason for staff at Hillingdon to have ordered one, based . on Dylan’s symptoms. He said: ‘It doesn’t matter if it was the weekend . or not, from the evidence, there was no need for an echo. ‘That for a cardiologist is a very . frightening thing because if I had to do the diagnosis again, given the . information we had, I wouldn’t have done anything differently.’ A post-mortem examination showed the . toddler’s heart was enlarged and his lungs had a viral infection that . contributed to his death but did not cause it. The cause of death was . given as heart disease. The coroner recorded a verdict of death from . natural causes.

"By . Vanessa Allen . A devastated father cradles his brain-damaged son, left in a coma after he refused to wear a cycle helmet and was then hit by a van. This heartbreaking image reveals the terrible consequences of 16-year-old Ryan Smith’s decision not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his fashionable hairstyle. Yesterday his family took the brave decision to allow the photograph to be published in the hope it will send a stark warning to other parents and teenagers. A father's anguish: Mark Smith gently cradles 16-year-old Ryan in hospital where he lies in a coma . Heartbreaking: Mark Smith with his son Ryan who . is in a coma after suffering serious head injuries after being involved . in a crash on his bike while not wearing a cycle helmet because he . didn't want to ruin his hair . Grammar school boy Ryan has been in a . coma for almost five weeks after being struck by the van as he cycled . to work at his holiday job last month. Crash: Ryan didn't want to ruin his hair by putting on a helmet as he cycled to work and now his father is calling for all cyclist to wear them . His distraught father Mark, 44, has spent every day at his bedside in the desperate hope that his ‘beautiful’ son will wake. The family face an agonising wait to . find out if he will regain consciousness, and have been warned that he . will probably be brain-damaged for life. Mr Smith said: ‘I wouldn’t wish this . on anybody. Any parent can imagine what this is like but I don’t want . anybody ever to live this nightmare. We don’t know yet how much of our . son we are going to get back, we will never know if a helmet would have . saved him. But I don’t want another parent to take that chance.’ Mr Smith and his wife Julie, 46, are . backing calls for cycling helmets to be made compulsory after their son . was almost killed in the collision near the Lincolnshire village of . Chapel St Leonards, where the family live, on July 22. They were warned that the GCSE . student might not survive the first 24 hours. He has been in a coma . since the accident and was initially completely unresponsive, although . his family have since noticed signs he could be responding to their . voices. Mr Smith – a paramedic who sees the . terrible aftermath of road crashes in his work – said he told Ryan to . wear a helmet when he cycled. But the youngster had worried it would . spoil his hairstyle and took the fateful decision to cycle without one. Mr Smith said: ‘I always wear a . helmet, I always told Ryan to wear a helmet, but he is 16, his hair is . his life and sadly he has the “not going to happen to me” attitude. ‘He’s like any young lad, they just . think they are invincible. But in a click of your fingers our family’s . life has changed permanently. I can make my four-year-old wear a helmet . but it is harder to tell an image-conscious teenager what to do. 'I still kiss him like I always have': Mr Smith tenderly kisses his son on the forehead. The family are cautiously optimistic about his chances, but Mr Smith admits that, even if his boy recovers, 'it won't be the same Ryan' Horrific: Mr Smith, a paramedic, had told Ryan to wear a helmet having seen the terrible consequences of cycle crashes in his work . ‘This needs to go to Parliament . straight away but people have no excuse not to go and buy a helmet. There is one in everyone’s price range and you should wear it even if . you’re just riding to the shop.’ Sports-mad Ryan, a pupil at Skegness . Grammar School, is due to receive his GCSE results today. Mr and Mrs . Smith will read them to him in hospital. The teenager, who met Paralympic . runner Richard Whitehead when he represented his school as a . ‘Paralympics Ambassador’ last year, had hoped to return to school for . his A-levels and to study engineering at university. Now his family fear he will face years of rehabilitation if he wakes from his coma, and have begun fundraising for his future. Mr Smith said: ‘One minute we had a . 16-year-old, fit and well and beautiful, awaiting his GCSEs eagerly, . couldn’t wait to get back to school for his A-levels, with the world at . his feet... and then it’s not going to be any more. ‘Ryan’s not going to be that young, . fit, active guy for some time now. But we are hopeful, we have seen . snippets of recovery in these five weeks, and Ryan’s tough and he’s . fighting. We spent a week with nothing, then a twitch from his left arm . and now he blinks to my voice. Popular: Some of the cards of support which have been sent to Ryan on his hospital ward . Fears: Ryan's family worry he will require years of rehabilitation despite having woken from his coma . ‘We are still waiting to see the . extent of the damage – there is no way of telling what sort of son we . will have back. But one thing is for sure – it won’t be the same Ryan.’ Ryan is being treated at the Pilgrim . Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, and is on the waiting list to be moved . to the specialist neurology ward at Lincoln County Hospital. His parents have begun fundraising . and have set up a Ryan Smith Foundation page on Facebook. Cycle helmets . are not compulsory in Britain, although Olympic champion and Tour de . France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins has backed calls for legislation to . force cyclists to wear them on roads. Research for the Department for . Transport showed that between 10 and 16 per cent of cycling deaths could . have been avoided if the cyclist had been wearing an appropriate . helmet. Ryan’s schoolfriend Hollie Simpson, 16, said the accident had shocked her into wearing a cycle helmet. She said: ‘I see so many people who don’t and I think Ryan would want to change that. ‘Ryan is so much fun. We all joked . about his quiff, he was always pushing his hair up and we think that’s . the first thing he’ll do when he wakes up.’ Sally Robinson, of the brain injury . charity Headway, said: ‘There’s clear evidence that cycle helmets reduce . the risk of sustaining skull and brain injuries.’","Ryan Smith has been in a coma for FIVE WEEKS since the accident .

"By . Sean Poulter & Sarah Harris . Prue Leith said the bureaucracy involved in going through the ingredient in every new dish would be difficult and time consuming . Restaurants, cafés and schools are being forced by the EU to identify and list 14 potential allergens in their food. Prue Leith, the renowned cook and TV food expert, condemned the changes as a ‘bureaucratic nightmare’ that make life very difficult for small restaurants to change their menus and offer a ‘dish of the day’. The law comes into effect later this year and will fundamentally change the way all food is sold in supermarkets, restaurants, office canteens and schools. Anyone selling food will be required to label allergens under one of 14 headings – ranging from gluten to soya, milk and mustard to sesame, lupin and sulphur dioxide. However, while this might be a simple task for the big brand chains who have a limited range of standard items, like McDonald’s and KFC, it will be an enormous burden for independents who change their dishes based on the fresh ingredients that are available. The new rules are designed to protect the estimated 21 million Britons who claim to have food allergies and will be policed by council trading standards officers, who can bring prosecutions and fines. Miss Leith said the bureaucracy involved in going through the ingredient in every new dish to decide whether it includes one of the 14 allergens would be difficult and time consuming. ‘My worry is that it will kill innovation and experimentation in the kitchen and cooking what is available daily in the market,’ she said. ‘Fine for formula restaurant chains which never change their menus and have bureaucrats to work out how any milligrams of anything a dish has, but for proper cooks - a nightmare.’ The chairman of the Restaurant Association, the 7th Earl of Bradford and runs Porters in Covent Garden, said: ‘It is typical of the heavy-handedness of the EU to bring in something like this. ‘It is ridiculously complicated and almost impossible for most restaurants to comply with. ‘It is well intentioned, obviously, and all restaurants want to protect their customers from harm, but this is just so complicated. The labelling will be easy for huge corporations like KFC and McDonald's to comply with because they have limited menus . ‘You have to audit every menu item, but also, if you buy in sauces, for example, you need to go to the supplier and get the allergen details from them, which is difficult and complicated.’ He said staff in his two restaurants are trained to offer advice on allergens, but he said: ‘If we are required to print all the details on the menus, they will become an absolute travesty. ‘What people who have allergies need to do is to alert the staff when they visit a restaurant. If the staff are trained properly, they will then be able to explain which dishes they will have a problem with,’ he said. Restaurants will be required either to provide information sheets or chalk boards listing the allergen contents of each dish, or to have members of staff who are trained to provide the information dish by dish. The changes also present huge challenges to catering companies and the nation’s school chefs, who are struggling to cope with the implementation of the new free school meals for the youngest primary school age children. Catherine Hinchcliff, the head of customer marketing at Bidvest 3663, a foodservice wholesale distributor, said that there had been little discussion in the education sector around the changes, which form part of the Food Information Regulations and come into force on December 13. ‘That will require any caterer effectively to provide information about the allergy implications of every dish on every menu,’ she said. ‘If things change, if the recipes change or substitutions come in they’ll need all the right processes, back of house to be able to make sure that that information’s up to date. It’s actually quite a lot to take on board. 1. Gluten containing cereals 2. Crustaceans 3. Molluscs 4. Fish 5. Peanuts 6. Lupin 7. Tree Nuts (such as walnut, hazelnut, almond etc.) 8.  Soya 9.  Eggs 10.  Milk 11.  Celery 12.  Mustard 13. Sesame 14.  Sulphur dioxide . ‘It’s a lot of work with understanding the allergens behind each dish, understanding the processes behind that, making sure there’s information available for front and back of house teams about what allergens sit in what dishes, doing all the kitchen audits to make sure that there’s no risk of contamination.’ She added: ‘There doesn’t appear to be very much useful research anywhere that allows us to understand what are the incidents of multiple allergies – how many children have allergies across all the 14 allergens. Do we just come up with a totally allergy free recipe or do you focus on egg, dairy, nuts? ‘That’s a real challenge for us all if we’re developing recipes.’ The penalties for serving food containing ingredients that include allergens without making this clear to customers can be severe, even under the current law. In May last year, Jamie Oliver’s Portsmouth restaurant was fined £8,500 after it served pasta to a coeliac after she requested a gluten free meal. Britain’s Food Standards Agency described the new allergen labelling rules as ‘good news for consumers’. It said: ‘The new regulation brings EU rules on general and nutrition labelling together into a single regulation to simplify and consolidate existing labelling legislation and applies in all member states. ‘These changes will provide allergen information in a clearer and more consistent way; making it easier for people to make safer food choices when buying food.’","Prue Leith described the changes as a ‘bureaucratic nightmare'

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Two children are dying needlessly or sustaining life-changing injuries from meningitis due to a delay in the vaccine being rolled out . At least 180 babies and children have been killed or left seriously damaged by meningitis B since the Government agreed in principle to provide them with jabs. It emerged today that negotiations with the company providing the new vaccine have not yet started – 13 weeks after the deputy chief . medical officer announced that children at risk would get protection. Bexsero is the first vaccine to offer protection against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis in the UK. Thousands of campaigners petitioned the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, urging them to ensure the vaccine was approved on the NHS. A U-turn by medical advisers to the Government in March led to routine vaccination being approved for infants and a one-off catch up programme for babies aged three and four months. But Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant that makes Bexsero, says it has not had a single meeting with the Department of Health to decide the price. UK charities say every day that passes means two children are dying needlessly or have life-changing injuries left by the disease. The UK has one of the highest Meningitis B incidence rates in . the world - affecting an average of 1,870 people each year - and the . disease can kill in hours. It kills more children under five than . any other infectious disease in the UK, around 10 per cent, and experts . calculate a further third are left with disabilities. Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said at the time of the vaccine being approved: ‘We will now be working closely with Novartis in the coming months and, if negotiations are successful, we hope to work with the other UK health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis B as quickly as possible.’ Campaigners hoped the decision meant babies could be getting jabs as early as the summer. Dr Andrin Oswald, head of the vaccine division at Novartis, said the company had increased production to meet the expected demands of the new programme. But if it does not start by the end of 2014, it will have to throw away more than a million doses of vaccine that could have been given to British babies and children. He has personally offered to meet Jeremy Hunt to ensure any possible obstacles are ironed out, but has never met him. Support: In January, 118 leading doctors wrote a letter urging Mr Hunt to give the jab the green light . He said ‘It is very frustrating and very sad because children keep on dying when we could do something about it. ‘When the vaccine was licensed 18 months . ago we wanted to make sure nothing on our side would hold up . negotiations on the price of the product. ‘We understand there needs to be a proper price that the minister can support but discussions have not started.’ Meningitis is a disease that terrifies parents and health professionals alike. With symptoms that can appear flu-like, it can turn overnight into a life-threatening condition. If meningitis-related blood infection takes hold, often the only way to save a child’s life is to amputate a limb. Hundreds of children are left disabled every year. Some forms of the disease have been wiped out by vaccination, but meningitis B, the most common form, has remained a killer. The new vaccine is estimated to cover 88 per cent of cases in the UK. Over the past decade there have been more than 10,000 cases recorded in England and Wales, with 500 deaths. Meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia remain the leading infectious cause of death for children under the age of five. Children who survive face neurological damage, limb amputation and severe skin damage. Andy Hopkinson, of the charity Meningitis Now, said: ‘We have had no further information about the timetable for introducing this vaccine, since the positive decision was announced at the end of March this year. ‘Previous new vaccine introductions have had really clear leadership within the Department of Health, with a Director of Immunisations. ‘With this position no longer existing and following all the changes in the Department of Health and NHS, we are concerned this will lead to delays. ‘Our latest figures suggest that around 800 Meningitis B cases in the UK could have been prevented since the vaccine was licensed for use in January 2013. Every day brings more cases and more misery.’ Dr Oswald said production of the vaccine had been stepped up to meet the needs of British children, but the expiry dates were fast approaching. ‘If the programme does not start by the end of 2014, we will have to throw away more than a million doses that could have protected them’ he added. A Department of Health spokesperson said:‘We want to agree a price as soon as possible so children can benefit from the vaccine, but we need to make sure NHS funds are used effectively and it is right we follow due process to make sure this happens. ‘Senior figures from the department, including the deputy chief medical officer, have already met with Novartis. 'We will be entering formal negotiations shortly so plans for the immunisation programme can be finalised.’","Government announced earlier this year it had approved the drug Bexsero .

"By . Josh Gardner . Shock: Theresa Hunt was shot dead by Richard Plotts in a Philadelphia hospital on Thursday after an argument broke out and a gun battle ensued . The distraught family of 53-year-old Theresa Hunt, the tragic mental-health caseworker shot dead by a psychiatric patient inside a Philadelphia hospital on Thursday, have vented their fury at her killer. Her sister, Martha Trinca, took to Facebook to label Richard Plotts -  who was critically wounded by hero Dr. Lee Silverman when he returned fire - a 'SOB' who 'needs to rot in hell forever'. The caseworker's devastated brother, Dennis Hunt, said that he was 'angry' at Plotts, 49, for taking Theresa's life, telling reporters that the youngest of nine children was known by her siblings as 'Mother Theresa' for her compassion. Writing on Facebook about her awful loss, Martha Trinca said that her sister was her 'best friend' and 'I'm glad I told her every time we talked how much I love her!! I will cherish our time together for the rest of my life!!' Her clearly emotional brother, Dennis, struggled to get through his interview with ABC 6 and said he wants to ask Plotts why he kiled his little sister. 'I want people to remember my sister as someone who was strong and stands up for what she believes in and good hearted... I don't know what to say,' said Dennis to ABC 6. 'I think that doctor who actually was armed, I think was incredible, what he did.' Scroll Down for Video . Anger: This is the message that Theresa Hunts sister, Martha Trinca, posted to Facebook on Saturday expressing her rage at her sister's killer . Fury: Martha Trinca is pictured here in a Facebook profile picture. She has launched an attack on her sister, Theresa Hunt's, killer, calling him an SOB who should rot in hell forever . The hospital horror unfolded on Thursday afternoon when patient Plotts arrived at the Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital with Hunt where they met Dr. Silverman in an office at the psychiatric unit on the third floor of the hospital. Once inside, the calamitious series of events began with a heated argument that ended with Hunt being fatally shot in the head, Dr. Silverman also suffering a hit to the head and Plotts critically wounded after two gunshot wounds to the torso and one to his arm. It was Dr. Silverman's quick reaction that saved lives and police have hailed him as a hero for stopping Plotts before he could embark on a gun rampage. Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.' 'Without . that firearm, this guy (the patient) could have went out in the hallway . and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the . chief said.

Tears: Dennis Hunt fought back his emotions as he tried to explain how he will feel and cope with the loss of his sister, Theresa, who was shot dead in Philadelphia on Thursday . Whelan identified the caseworker killed Thursday afternoon at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital as Theresa Hunt, 53. Hunt, who was from Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to an appointment with Silverman at a psychiatric crisis center adjacent to the hospital in Darby, just southwest of Philadelphia, authorities said. 'When the caseworker was shot, (Silverman) crouched down behind the desk to avoid him being shot,' Whelan said. 'He was able to reach for his weapon, and realizing it was a life or death situation, was able to engage the defendant in the exchange of gunfire.'

A struggle ensued and spilled out into the hallway, Whelan said. Another doctor and a caseworker jumped in to help Silverman and secure Plotts' weapon, he said. The motive for the shooting remained unclear late Thursday, although Whelan said Plotts, of Upper Darby, might have had issues with the doctor over his treatment plan. However, it's unclear if that's why Silverman was armed, apparently against hospital policy. 'We do believe that there were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' the prosecutor said. 'From all accounts, (he) would have acted in self-defense.' Whelan said that Plotts, 49, was still in surgery Thursday evening at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, while Silverman had been treated and released. Telephone calls to the doctor's home went unanswered. Fatal shooting: Several victims were reported after shots were fired at the Darby Borough hospital and at least one victim has died . Suspect: Shots broke out around 2pm but by 3pm reports from the scene indicated the suspected shooter was in custody . Plotts does not have a listed home phone number. Court records in Delaware County show a man of the same name and age with a lengthy criminal record, but Whelan was uncertain if they were the same person. The hospital has a policy barring anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from carrying weapons on its campus, a spokeswoman for the Mercy Health System said. But Molineux insisted Silverman was a hero who saved lives. Two guns were recovered from the scene, Whelan said. Staff members had heard loud arguing inside Silverman's office during the appointment. They opened the door and noticed the patient had a gun pointed at the doctor, so they quietly closed the door and dialed 911, Whelan said. Gunshots were heard a short time later, just before 2:30 p.m. Terrifying: Around 100 terrified people ran out of the hospital's wellness center as SWAT teams rushed in .

'They acted vigilantly. They acted bravely,' he said. The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community teaching hospital. Authorities said there are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area outside. They also said the center had no metal detectors. Patients waiting in the first-floor lobby reported a tense scene when police arrived and ordered everyone out. Most of the patients were elderly. 'I dozed off, and I heard the cop shouting, ""Come on, come on, get out!""' said Millicent Russell, of Lansdowne, who was waiting for a 3 p.m. appointment.

Police investigating the death of a father who had a severe allergic reaction to nuts have arrested two men believed to work at the takeaway which served him a meal containing peanuts. Paul Wilson, 38, died after eating a curry from a takeaway which is believed to have contained peanuts. The bar manager was found unresponsive in the living quarters of the Oak Tree Inn, in the village of Helperby, North Yorkshire in January. Police have now confirmed that two men - a 51-year-old and 38-year-old - were arrested in connection with his death and have since been released on bail while the investigation continues. The takeaway has been named locally as the Indian Garden in the nearby small market town of Easingwold. Paul Horsman, the manager of The York pub in Easingwold was one of the last people to see Mr Wilson alive. The pair were friends and Mr Wilson would often stop for a drink at The York on his days off. On the night before he died Mr Wilson was waiting for a taxi to take him home with the curry at the pub. Mr Horsman, who has run the pub for 26 years, said: 'It was a shock to find out someone I was talking to 12 hours before had died. 'He came here regularly on his days off. The taxi driver who took him home came round the next day and told me. 'The CID had spoken to him because it was the last number on (Mr Wilson's) mobile.' Mr Wilson died after eating a takeaway from Indian Garden in Easingwold, local sources reported . Closed for business: A note in the window of Indian Garden . He said he was told that two men were taken from the restaurant by officers, adding: 'Indian Garden has been closed for at least a fortnight. 'I heard the police came at 9.30 one Monday morning. They took out bags and various items.' A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Officers are working with Trading Standards to establish the circumstances surrounding Mr Wilson’s death.' North Yorkshire County Council confirmed . Trading Standards were assisting police in their enquiries but would not . comment further. The death of bar manager Mr Wilson, who had a young son, was linked to anaphylactic shock from peanuts found in a meal. Speaking after his death, a representative of pub company Provenance Inns, owners of the Oak Tree Inn paid tribute to Mr Wilson. In a statement, they said: 'We are all distraught over loss of Paul, who was a fun and kind-hearted chap - the perfect guy to be working in a pub. Local: The York pub, where Mr Wilson had a drink while waiting for the taxi that would take him home to eat his takeaway curry . Accommodation: The bar manager was found unresponsive in the living quarters of the Oak Tree pub in Helperby, North Yorkshire . 'He fitted in very quickly and had a great many friends. Paul will be much missed by everyone.' There are only about ten recognised deaths from food allergy in the UK every year. Mr Wilson’s passing came ahead of the . Government introducing new food information regulations later this . year, which stipulate eating establishments must provide detailed . information about any allergens contained in their food. About one in 100 Britons are allergic to peanuts. It is the most common type of food allergy, which people rarely grow out of. For unknown reasons, studies have shown a sharp rise in peanut allergies over the last 20 years. Attempts to find a cause have proved inconclusive. Many studies have suggested unborn children whose mothers eat peanuts are less likely to develop an allergy, although this is disputed. If you are allergic to nuts, you will not have a reaction the first time you come into contact. At first, your immune system reacts and prepares to fight. The second time, a full allergic reaction occurs. Symptoms often start quickly, within minutes of coming into contact with a nut - or even a fraction of a nut. Those severely allergic will fall into anaphylaxis, requiring an adrenaline injection straight away, which will give them time to get to hospital. Curry . sauces from restaurants across the country are being urgently tested . after three deaths were linked to an allergic reaction from peanuts in . takeaways. Safety . chiefs fear a new food scandal with fraudsters adulterating expensive . almond powder used to thicken sauces with cheap ground peanuts – a move . which can prove fatal if the meal is eaten by someone suffering from a . peanut allergy. Connor Donaldson, 12, from Tyldesley, . Greater Manchester, and Derek Stephenson, 32, a gardener from Stanhope, . County ­Durham, have also died in separate cases. Some people suffer an . allergic reaction if they eat any type of nut, but others can safely eat . almonds and pistachios grown on trees and are only affected by peanuts, which are grown in soil. Under current legislation, eating establishments are legally obliged to provide information about allergens only if they are asked to by a customer. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ordered councils to encourage restaurant owners to check their ingredients. New rules come into effect in December which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory. A North Yorkshire County Council spokeswoman said the authority was set to launch an allergens awareness raising campaign ahead of the new legislation coming into force on December 13. Following Mr Wilson’s death, his parents Margaret and Keith asked for donations on a JustGiving page in memory of their son to be given to Allergy UK.

"By . Josh Gardner . A woman and a dog recently had the good fortune to find each other at a Nebraska animal shelter, not only because they both needed companions, but also because they're both deaf. Cindy Koch had been looking for a pet that shared her condition and employees at the Central Nebraska Humane Society wanted the pit bull mix they'd fallen in love with to find the same thing. When Rosie and Cindy met this month, everyone was a winner. But it took some time for shelter employees to figure out just what they were dealing with in the 3-year-old rescue.

Cindy Koch was experiencing some of those same feelings as she came to take Rosie home. 'I'm going to teach her my sign language, how deaf people communicate, she's a smart dog, she can pick up fast,' said Koch as she sat with her family, Rosie's head in her lap. Koch said she'd always wanted a deaf dog and jumped at the chance to adopt Rosie when she heard she'd spent three months at the Grand Island, Nebraska shelter and needed a home.
